Pretty good chinese food. We ordered the chicken soup, cabbage with chilli peppers, chicken chowmien and dry pot lotus root. Everything was fresh and delicious. They're also doing 15% if you go pick up your order in store!< /Review>

Cauliflower:
This wasn't on the menu but we asked for different veggie options. The spices and flavors used in this stir fry were so good! There are small pieces of pork belly that marinate in the same seasonings. Awesome!

Cumin ribs:
These were soooo tender; the meat just falls off the bone. The outer coating is nice and crispy from the cumin rub. Amazing! Probably my favorite dish.

Mushroom beef fillet mild:
This was ok. It has that kind of greasy soy flavor. It wasn't bad, just not my taste.

Specially tea smoked duck:
This has a nice smokey flavor, almost like a ham but in duck format. The skin is super crispy and thin and not that oily either. This was pretty good! I just wish I could taste more tea flavor.<//Review>

Worst experience, will never recommend this no moral restaurant. The waitress were yelling all the time, they scold the Uber Eats driver and used very nasty words towards them while we are eating. One waitress complained us loudly for packing our unfinished rice. I do not think people should come here and support the restaurant whose waitress will treat other terribly, and gossip the clients.<//Review>

The food is great the staff is friendly a little hard to understand. Other than that it was a little delay in getting my food but I guess she had to cook the duck so that took a little while make it four out of five stars cuz the food is good.</Text>

Food was excellent. Just like Hunan. Very authentic. Would give 5 stars but only beer as alcohol option with many choices on the menu being unavailable. Come for the food. The Chairman Mao pork was amazing. The fried rice, very good. Stinky tofu was on point, and the lamb with sour vegetables pot very good too. The BEST, however is the eggplant. get it.</Text>

Can’t recommend. Half of my “chicken” was bone and gristle. $16 for a chicken dish and I had to throw half of it away. What was left had good flavor, but a little dry.</Review>

This place is full of native Chinese speakers as customers. The "Best Grilled Fish" looks intimidating, but it's super flaky and moist so it's easy to eat. They also pull out the center bone before cooking. That fish was awesome, the Mapo Tofu was ok.< /Review>

I lived in Hunan for more than five years. This food tastes the same. It's very authentic. But I only gave four stars because you have to serve yourself water from the water cooler across the room. It would be much better if they left a pitcher of water on the table. For faster service, you have to summon the waiters Chinese style (with a loud voice). Don't be shy. It's just a cultural difference. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large enough. There's plenty of parking outside, but be prepared to wait in line a bit during peak hours. If you like spicy, order the frog.<//Text>

Overpriced poor quality food, not at all like in China.  I have visited Beijing, Xi'an, Yichang, Shanghai, and Zhengzhou in China. The restaurants where the locals eat in each of these areas have excellent food prepared by owners who take pride in the quality and preparation of their food.  They serve some of the best food I have ever eaten with large portions, fresh ingredients, and fair prices.  Village Kitchen is the opposite.  The food is bland and every corner is cut to maximize profits.  The lamb pictured in the menu shows chunks, however what is served is miniscule shavings of lamb like the wood shavings from a pencil sharpener.  The only flavor of the lamb dish was an overabundance of cooking oil.  When I got home my body decided to reject the meal from both ends. My wife ordered the pork stomach which was also bland and priced double that of better quality restaurants.  If you are planning to spend at least $50 for two people, a way better meal can be had at the many better Chinese restaurants in San Diego like Chins and Chuns.</text>

<review>Very authentic Hunan food, arguably the most authentic in town. They have some fairly spicy dishes. Highly recommended to those loving spicy food. They do also have very delicious non-spicy dishes. So don't worry if you have somebody can't handle spicy food in your group.<//review>< Pictures>

And the woman freaking told me no and to wait 40 minutes, i called again and she told me no wait an 1 hour, i called AGAIN to ask to speak to someone else and they started answering and hanging the phone up on me.

<Review>The Hunan style food is good. But the service is very very bad. The servers were just standing there, chatting and laughing. I waited for a long time for nothing. So I had to bring my menu to them and said 'can I order please', and came to them to say 'I need to pay the bill please'. I don't want to beg the server to serve me. In sum, food is good (5 stars), and don't give tip since its like a buffet (-3 stars).< /Review>< username>

Food is decent but service is horrible.  They were quick to seat me, take my order and bring my food, but then they forgot me. No one asked if I wanted more to drink, or cared if I liked my food.  I seriously considered walking out without paying after making eye contact with three employees who saw my empty plates and still didn't come over to see if I was ready for the check.  I finally got it and then had to flag someone else down to run my card.
I'm leaving this place now and headed to Starbucks for an iced tea...I'm thirsty.< /Review>

<Review>We were totally satisfied with the food, the service, the price and the atmosphere. This is truly Chinese spicy, authentic Hu-Nan village cuisine! We were very delighted for our dinner!< /Review>< Rate>

Don't go there! I have been here twice. The waiter would ignore you like 40 mins every time.
Also I come here at 9:01 pm today which during their time. But they told me it is already closed even on their poster which in front of their door says it closes at 10:00 pm. I don't know the reason why they refuse to serve before their close time. The waiter are very impolite. Don't go there! Save your time and money!<//Review>

Two parties ordered after us were served food before us. We waited for 20 minutes to get a pre-made cold dish and 40 to get a simple pan fry dish. Waitresses acted like they don't even work there. Took forever to get their attention, even longer to actually get what we asked from them (they did bring loads of attitude on time when we had to remind them). We've been to restaurant with bad services but this one tops them all. Will not come back again and will not recommend any of our friends to come to this place.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dc0089c63baddf:0x437ace8de6f16cd3< /gmap_id></record>

<review>This is one of my favorite Chinese places in San Diego, alongside Village North.  They serve Hunan cuisine which is known for its spiciness and unforgiving assault of flavors on the palate, so be prepared for a heavy tasting meal and perhaps lots of rice and ice water!

Some of the highlights here include the preserved pork--I like it both in the stir fry and in the dry pot.  The stir fry can be a tad dry at times, but the fresh garlic leaves more than make up for that, and the dry pot is just so flavorful with the smoked bamboos, giving the dish as smoky of a flavor as you will ever find in Chinese food (which should appeal to any BBQ fans out there).  Chairman Mao's braised pork is quite good, similar to many other braised pork dishes, with a fermented bean curd flavor, as is common in the braised pork of certain Chinese (non Shanghainese) cuisines.  The deboned pork rib with fried egg casserole is actually one of the milder dishes on the menu in terms of flavor, but not in terms of spiciness! It's one that I enjoy very much as well for some lighter dishes to balance the others.  On the other hand, the pickled chilli with pork is quite a spicy dish, with the aromas of the chilli pepper making the dish very very good.

Of the non-pork dishes, the Chef's Beef Brisket is quite good, a little bit reminiscent of beef noodle soups except served as a dish without noodles and soup.  The mapo tofu is a simple but very flavorful dish with plenty of Sichuan peppercorns to numb your tongue.  The steamed egg here is possibly one of my favorite steamed eggs I've had, with some good flavors and a very good texture on the egg--not over or underdone.  The eggplant with green chilli and century egg dish is one of their signatures for a reason.  The flavors are very balanced with the eggplant serving as a good base.

I could probably go on about the other dishes since there really hasn't been many that have disappointed me.  I highly recommend coming with a group of people to order and try more dishes and seeing which you enjoy the most!  I also noticed that the dishes tend to be spicier in the summer, since perhaps it fluctuates with the spiciness of the chilli peppers which may be seasonal, so if you want to give yourself a challenge, definitely come during that time.< /review>< pics>

Never go here!!! They give very BAD service and horrible food. And I gave 5% tip for my unsatisfactory experience, guess what, they ignored that and still billed me 15% tip on my credit card!!! Spent 5 minutes to dispute with the bank and got the money back :) . What an AWFUL place!< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Real Chinese food. The food has the potential to be better, but this style of cooking is not easy to come by in San Diego and is good enough for me to come back regularly. Particular favourites: kourou (pork belly), mashed pidan and eggplant, taro and radish soup, among others. Note: the tudousi (potato matchsticks in vinegar) are pretty spicy here.<//Review>< Rate>

<Text>This place was recommended by one of our foodie friends so I had decent expectations coming in. I found out later that there was one particular dish he was a fan of - the mashed eggplant with century egg. Comes with a giant mortar and pestle that looked pretty neat and was the best mix of flavors in an eggplant dish I've ever had if not the biggest portion. Most of the other dishes were just average (braised pork), lacking in flavor (fried rice), or just came with a higher price when compared with other places such as Chef Chin or Szechuan Chef.

Since I'm a fan of tea we also tried the Dragon Well and Oosmanthus Oolong teas which looked like they were loose leaf but somehow still lacked flavor, perhaps they had been recycled?

Food did come out quickly though and service was pretty good for a Chinese place - we were in and out in about an hour. If you're really into Hunan cuisine, you might like it more but otherwise I would consider it a maybe try once kind of place.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

As a result, the Yangzhou fried rice and the small fried pork have the same spiciness. The child can't eat at all. Obviously, it is not good to wash the pot after frying the dishes 😷

The cumin ribs were paste hard like bricks (the ribs are still hot and not cold), and they were used for grinding teeth.

One thing to say, the other dishes taste pretty good.

点了几个辣菜，给孩子点了不辣的扬州炒饭。结果扬州炒饭和小炒肉一个辣度。孩子根本没法吃。显然是炒完菜不好好洗锅😷

孜然排骨都糊了硬的跟砖一样（排骨还热着没有凉），磨牙用了。

有一说一，其他菜味道都还不错。<//review><rating>2</rating><Time>1620447249420<//Time><userid>102194548127133785870</userid><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaZaRbgLlXhT0o0w-krEq71_yFxuNbwtcycFig=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The dishes are large and the ingredients are good. Fatty intestines and yellow throat taste good. The grilled fish must be grilled on the fire for a while to taste. Unlike the domestic ones, live fish are killed in the country, and the grilled fish is reheated here. Maybe the United States does not allow restaurants to kill fish now.

菜量很大，食材也不错。肥肠、黄喉味道都很好。 烤鱼一定要多用火烤一会才入味。和国内的不一样，国内是活鱼现杀，这里是烤好的鱼再加热。 可能是美国不允许餐厅现杀鱼吧。<//Text>< Pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) This Hunan restaurant far exceeds my imagination of Hunan cuisine, delicious! I heard about it a long time ago, but there are too many people, so you have to wait in line. It was only recently that you have the courage to go, like it once, and go for a second time, worth it! The waiter is very busy, but the attitude is very good, I like it, there are many dishes I will try again, solemnly recommend!

這家湖南館子，遠遠地超過了我對湖南菜的想像，好吃！很久以前就聽說了，但是人太多了，得排隊，一直到最近才鼓起勇氣去了，一次就喜歡，又再去了第二次，值！服務員很忙碌，但態度很好，我喜歡，還有很多菜我都要再去試看看，鄭重推薦！<//text>< Time>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Not clean, ate a diarrhea. We went to eat three people yesterday. Order steamed fish, chicken chop, cucumber skin, a dish and so on. As a result, all three people have diarrhea, and I still want to vomit. When I saw the black mark left on the napkin when I wiped the chopsticks, I should go right away.

Had the BEST experience at Grasshopper today! Budtenders are so nice and so helpful! Everyone really knows their cannabis! Came in looking for something to help me relax and was delighted to be assisted by Lissa who was able to walk me through my entire purchase with ease! Such great quality products, I will be coming back ASAP< /review>

Grasshopper Dispensary is a welcome addition to the South Bay. They've definitely done it right, the retail space is on par with other SD dispensaries and practices all health and safety protocols. Staff seems friendly and security ensures customers have a pleasant shopping experience.</review>

Finally, a legal dispensary in Chula Vista! They've been open about 2 weeks, 20% FTP, cash only. ATM on site, $4 surcharge. Excellent staff, knowledgeable and friendly.  Visit them and support local businesses,  I know I'll be back there soon.</Review>

I just used this company today and I love it! From the start of just calling them on the phone the employee was super friendly, knowledgeable, and accurate.  From answering questions to offering suggestions it went very smooth from there! I made my order and within minutes you get a confirmation text that lets you know your order and then to top it off there’s a tracking of the delivery to know exactly where it is and when it will be arriving. They have an amazing website with the new and hottest items on the market! I would recommend this place and service and would give ten stars if I could!</review>

This place is alright. I dont like the fact that they dont have the weed in jars so you can smell it and get a better look at it. I will be true to the dispensary in Spring Valley cuz they have WAY BETTER PRICES!!! Doesnt matter if I have to drive a little further. It is worth that drive. Nice try Chula Vista. Bring back the old dispensaries, and the revenue for the city will be MUCH HIGHER!!!!< /Review>

Great service.. great dispensary! I got a delivery from these guys and I received my meds in less than 30 minutes. They even gave me some extras in my goodie bag. I will never use the other delivery services again. I'll be back to shop with my peeps at Grasshopper.< /text>

I also don't like that their website lies about the amount of THC content in their flower. I would have liked the online inventory to reflect what you actually had on hand. Buying something at 32% THC only to receive it at 26% was a huge letdown. Not sure if I'll repeat.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I went into Van's to buy a gift for someone, it was early afternoon and the store was empty. The staff didn't once ask if I needed help and like other reviews have said, I felt like they were too bothered and annoyed.
I was in the store for quite a while too and the only service (if that) was when I asked for a size. BUT, to top it off, NONE of the shoes I asked for (probably asked for 5 or 6 different ones) were in the size I wanted. You'd think that the staff would have offered a solution or alternative? You would think they would act like they wanted me to buy something? At least point me to their website right?? Nope.
So I ended up leaving, having bought nothing with such a bad taste in my mouth. Never going back. I'm not asking for star quality service, but just common basic service. You can find so much better at other stores.<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>This Vans store in the Westfield shopping center has a good selection of well, Vans shoes, clothing and accessories. Service was helpful and friendly, the associate did a great job trying to find a good fit. The store itself was pretty clean and organized.< /Text>< pics>

Not like Linda Vista 5 spots for helpers, desk personnel, yet ONLY One, mean, unruly too-long-on-job POSTAL worker, aka bully. The people at Mission Valley Mall great 👍 and helpful.

I was expecting the worst passport application experience based on previous reviews, but it was the complete opposite. The woman working the desk was super organized and helpful, respected the appointment times to the point that she let me go before someone else who was there before me with a later appointment time. Of course do your homework, have all your ID items and paperwork done, and it will go smoothly.< /Text>

The delivery drivers will say they “delivered” your package & even scan it. But will not walk out of their truck and actually deliver it. The representatives at the actual USPS building (INCLUDING THE SUPERVISORS) are super rude over the phone. I understand dealing with people’s mail must be exhausting, but arguing with the customer who is telling you YOUR DRIVER DID NOT DELIVER MY PACKAGE is unprofessional. When asked to call the driver and ask where the package was delivered or to dispatch him again to show me, they refused & forced me to just file a claim. So not only am I missing a DEEP FREEZER, which I had been waiting a month for, but I am also missing an explanation. This is the second time I’ve had mail “DELIVERED” and not really be there (the first time, was a social security check they kept saying was delivered until I threatened to have an investigation filed. All of a sudden, my check was delivered the next day).</text>

Worst customer service run by clowns. I was on hold for 30 and hour, they rarely pick up the phone. When I made a call again they literally put me on hold again, they didnt even ask for my name or tracking number. Even doe after they pick up the guy did not help much and when asking questions he just hangs up. How hard is it to help with a package?< /review>

< Review>
My appointment was cancelled only a few hours before the actual appointment because only one employee works the passport counter and they were sick. I don’t blame the employee; they can’t control getting sick. But how does a business that is booked almost every day only have one person working the passport counter? Also, they called from an unknown number, didn’t leave a number to reschedule with, and the number online will not go through even after calling 10 times. Because it wasn’t officially cancelled, I still got a text and email reminder for the appointment and had to cancel and reschedule myself. This wouldn’t be such a big deal to me if it wasn’t such short notice. I only had Monday (today) and Tuesday free, and will not be able to come in any of the days they recommended.< /Review>

<text>Why can't we give minus stars on a review?  Filled out a slip to have mail forwarded over a month ago and not one piece has been forwarded.  To top it off, I even put a note in the old mailbox (as per instructions from the postal carrier) to say to please forward my mail because someone else is still living there.  Nope, still not forwarded.  Why in the heck doesn't the government shut them down and privatize.  We would have way better service for lower cost.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

The office itself is awful - can't get through; dispatcher doesn't always tell carriers about scheduled picks ups, bad.  But we have 2-3 carriers on our route (who are connected with this p.o. location) who are topnotch - when they're on, it helps make up for the disfunctionality of this location - these mail carriers will even check regular shippers to see if we had something to go out. When they aren't, such as today, I can't get through to anyone & am unsure whether an important pick up is going to happen :(<//text>

<review>Surely woman who works the front counter and equally surely carrier supervisor when I handed him a huge handful of rubber bands and told him I didn't know why my carrier for the past two weeks has left a pile of these on the ground beside my mail box.  He said most people have a trash can by the mail boxes. I told him it was 3 boxes for 3 separate houses, he insisted a trash can should be by the boxes.  I said who's supposed to dump it? He didn't know, have maint. dump it.  I reminded him it's three separate houses on three separate lots, not apts. or condos. He said he'd talk to his employee about not doing that anymore.  The postal workers in the Hillcrest branch are outgoing and friendly.  also the 'Lobby" open hours online are wrong, but the two people I spoke to told me I looked at the wrong thing online.  I will be writting to the Postmaster in the main Post Office in Rancho Bernardo about the wrong hours and the surely people and unhinged carrier.</review>< UserId.>

This is a pointless mail dispatch facility that is not a full-service location. Since it is a back-office function it shouldn't have any signage or suggestion on Google Maps that it provides postal services.<//Text>

<Review>They actually managed to lose my mail, I had a package going to a P.O. box and it never arrived. Myself and the worker at the place couldn't figure out why it never arrived as it made it to San Diego and this post office. I called and the person on the phone was just as confused as myself and said he needed to talk to the carrier. He took down my info and said he'd get back to me, that never happened. Every time I have attempted to call after that has been unsuccessful.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Called about a vacation hold and a very surly employee gave me a partial excuse, but left out some important details about why I didn't get my mail. Then he hung up on me. No wonder the USPS is headed for closure.< /Review>

Complete and utter morons.  I had a package that needed a signature and they left me slip to pick up the package at the Adams Ave Post office...and when I went to Adams Ave post office, they said they do that all the time.   THey also do NOT honor change of addresses...they continue to deliver mail and then rather than forward it they just return to sender saying cannot forward.  they do not answer their phone either...<//Text>

During the pandemic, all human contact is done at the car. The staff are friendly, patient and helpful and I'm a first time dog mom with lots of questions! Too new to have a track record, but so far so good.</review>

<Text>My 2yr old Aussie is extremely scared of vets. She has separation anxiety and immediately goes into panicking mode when we pull into her parking lots. When I switched over to bear valley I was hoping my dog would take to the staff there and she did. They handled her so nicely and softly. When owners were allowed in with the pets during an appointment my dog usually cowered behind me, when covid struck and we were allowed in my dog had to go alone. Usually after visits at other vets we come home and she’s pooped and tired all day from her high anxiety levels. After her first appointment when i wasn’t allowed in barley was happy and energetic and crazy all day long which just shows me how well the staff here handles their clients. I am so incredibly happy with the bear valley staff and will recommend them to all my friends!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Excellent! Easy, quick, polite and a fair fee. They took my bunny and finding an exotic vet isn't easy. Would go again.</Review>

We recently had to put our beloved dog, Spencer, to sleep. She had been adopted from Woods in 2008 and she was most likely around 15 when she was ready to go. Though we had never met the vet, Dr. Laura Whitelaw, she treated us with such kindness and reverence that I was touched inside of my own grief. She treated it more like a funeral for a beloved family member than anything and made sure to check in with us, and what we wanted while still being professional. I think you can tell a lot from a vet, and a person, when they are asked to put down a pet-- and she stood out as a compassionate animal lover who truly cared about us and our dog. This may be too much information for a google review, but I just really wanted to convey that Dr. Whitelaw is a good one in my book.< /review>

Well, my pup is extremely shy/scared of people. I let her know how he was and she was was not hesitant whatsoever. He peed on the poor girl and nipped at her..she handled it so well. She kept calm and and shrugged it off. Got him in and out, fast service :)<//Text>

Not recommended for reptiles, well, chameleons specifically. They took my money for months while telling me my chameleon was completely healthy, when it came time to get my chameleon’s eggs removed, we went to them and they told us they didn’t know how to do the surgery. So we went to another vet in Pismo, on top of examining her, told us very serious problems she developed and showed xrays of bone problems, which were completely over looked or straight up ignored by Bear Valley. I haven’t had any other animals that I’ve taken in there so I can’t be a critic to that, but definitely keep reptiles/chameleons away< /review>

Extremely good technically only matched by the ability to calm animals in an atmosphere they don't normally feel comfortable.  In other words they treat their animals like they are their own and really care about them I have the necessary skills and expertise to diagnose and heal them.< /Review>

This place is honest, fair and very kind. Fair prices as well. Both doctor and assistant will make you feel comfortable they will never make you feel forced into doing anything. Good quality work with a gentle hand. Very good with children!<//Text>

They worked on my teeth but he had 3 other appointments book for the same time he left me in a chair in a room with a moth block in my moth for 45 mins and keep coming in the room working on my teeth after being in a room with another patient and never Shane his gloves I haven’t been back some and when I told him like hey your touch blood then touching me you didn’t change your gloves he told me well tell the girls in the front don’t book appointments so close together or at the same time . I’d rather let a vet work on my teeth someone is going to get hiv or worse don’t go here< /review>

< Review>
wow!! Is all I can say. From front office to back office, you all made my day. Had such a wonderful experience. PAIN FREE!!! Yes!!! PAIN FREE!! I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled this pass Saturday and a crown. Dr. Joseph was excellence. He pulled all 4 of my teeth in 15 mins or less. Fabby & Amy was assisting him. Very gentle, walked me through the process, was not rough, and took there time.  Dani did my x-rays and was gentle and friendly. Amy, Dani. Dr Joseph, Fabby, Nubia, & Aleli you all rock. Thank you for your excellent customer service, making me feel at home &  comfortable. I'm so glad I choose you guys for my services. I  can't believe I'm saying this but I had such a wonderful experience. They did not over charge me like these other dentist offices, was knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly. If your looking for a dentist office please call them.. You will be so pleased. Thank you! Thank You!< /Review>

<text>If I could give 0 stars I would. The experience here was the worst, the nurse for one was rude while taking my X-rays it was the most unpleasant thing ever. Then the doctor came in to check and I felt like I was being rushed out of there so once they take to make an appointment the lady in front desk was being rude telling me I’d have to pay even tho I’ve had this discussion with my dentist already and I know I’m covered. So she just made feel so uncomfortable. This place is horrible don’t come here. WASTE of my time. Worse customer services</text><date>1609451507062</date>< username>

When it came time to actually get the work done, I was amazed at how quickly he was able to work on me. Best part of all, NO pain!< /text>< Pictures>

This is the best place to get any dental work done. The specialists and dentists that work there are top notch. Don’t waste your time going anywhere else! Top quality dentistry and very competent staff that know what they’re doing. Amazing service, very friendly, and very professional.<//Text>

This place was okay when I started coming . I decided to go ahead and get braces here but I completely regret it . They take so long . I'm usually early to my appointments and for some reason I always have to wait more than 15 minutes everytime and when I ask there's always attitude Idk if its because I work at a dental office and our customer service is great where we make sure we don't let our patients wait for no longer than 5 min . Trust me if my office worked with regular braces I would've just got them there .<//Text>

Jenny and Kim needs to be fired. The entire staff from the front desk to the other side of the office needs customers service training. Some of their teeth doesn’t look any better than the patient. They need to stop scamming people for their insurance to fit the doctor’s budget and make decisions that’s best for the patients health and insurance. This use to be a really good place.< /text>

I was quoted One Price firmly then after words they did the work it was a whole $1,000 more they claim that they have to send me to the other side for another procedure. I think it's unnecessary and they don't try to work with people I think it's just a way to spread the money around so all the dentists can get a piece of it. You can have good work at fair prices if you looking for that it's a not hear<//review>

I’ve been going to this Children’s Dental for 8+ years. I think since my daughter was two years old. The wait is never too long, an hour or two. They Dentist do take their time to care for your child’s teeth. Well, at least I noticed with my daughter. Fairly clean place, too. I like that they call you to remind you of your appointment. Which is nice, because I would have definitely missed a lot of her appointments if it wasn’t for their courtesy call reminder... But, I did notice that I did not receive a reminder this time around, and I did require about that. They said something like they will send text or emails out for appointment reminder not calls.. I also like when they gave out balloons to the little kiddos. What happened to that? What changed?</Text>

I have been coming to Schnierow Dental for 20 years, at first, I thought this dental group was the best thing to slice bread. Now, trying to make appointments are like pulling teeth (called 6 X's 1-14-2019 @ 1:23 PM) was hung up on 5 out of the 6 times.  I love my oral surgeon (Dr. G.), but if the customer service doesn't improve, I'll be looking for a new dental group in 2019 (resolution).</Text>

This place is a total scam. Took my sister in for her check up and they told her that her wisdom teeth were coming out sideways and that she needed to remove them ASAP. They even showed her supposedly her teeth exrays. After hearing their absurd prices we went to a different dentist who told us that her wisdom teeth were coming out upwards and was no need to remove them. PLEASE BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS PLACE!</Review>

There is not much time for communication or TLC with patients, and this is very apparent when you walk in and see a waiting room full of people on their phones; waiting to be called.

The facility – very dated look and extremely old creaking chairs. Chipped paint and dirty floors

The employee morale – the assistants here are on their toes but the doctors were all overworked and had low spirits. This is obviously not good for patient care

Patient attitude – a lot of people would get frustrated by long wait times and leave. I don’t blame them. And when the facility looks like it was built 50 years ago, no one is in the mood to smile.

Doctors length of time worked at this office – when you look at the website and see who will be treating you, it shows doctors that have been there for years. Those doctors don’t exist there anymore and their website has never been updated. After speaking will all of their doctors, no one had been there for more than a year. This is terrible for patient care and continuity of care. As a patient, you should have a bond with your doctor and they know exactly what your wants/needs are.

Payscale – they told me they were going to pay me a certain amount for working there, for which they only paid 2/3 of the amount. Should I call a lawyer and look into this or should I leave an objective review for future doctors and patients to see what kind of ethics Robert Schneirow actually has?

For future doctors looking into working here, stay away.
For future patients looking to get their work done, stay away.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This is the place to go if you need dental care. Especially if you need root canals or crowns, go see Dr. Bhalla. She is the best! And I have been to several dentists but I always come back to Dr. Bhalla.< /Text>

This place is horrible! I made an appointment over the phone, they give u no confirmation or anything. Appointment system is completely disorganized. I come in they can’t find my appointment and they treat me like I haven’t been to this place even though I’ve been going for years, had me fill out unnecessary paperwork like who referred you,etc (mind you I’ve been going for years). Tried to make me wait an hour and a half then tell me they can’t verify my insurance because it’s Saturday. I asked the lady who booked my appointment would it be an issue and she said no. Come in and it’s a different story. If you want to waste your time and got all day on a Saturday to do a simple check up then go here. I on the other hand will be going somewhere else where they are more organized and with better customer service.< /Text>

This is the worst kids dentist I ever been too. I thought the adult side was bad. The kids side is just as bad. How do you have a appointment and show up on time and they take 2hrs. I would not recommend  this Dentist Office to anyone.  If I can give them no stars I would.<//review>

I like this place been coming here since my daughter was 3 she is now 21. I brought my son here inJuly 2018 November 2018 then 2/2/19.  So far no problems the staff is a little unfriendly.  The dentist was great and the hygienist.  The lady walking around she may be the boss she’s ok as well.  I have always like Schnierow dental but the front desk staff is not the same< /Text>

<pics>None</pics><Text>I just had the WORSE experience at this office! I called in the morning to verify the total of my 2 crowns, the lady I spoke with clearly told me that my insurance covered the treatment so we preceded and made an appointment. When I got there for my appointment, the lady said I had to pay a total amount out of pocket due to my insurance not covering the full price. When I told them about the conversation I had this morning, they told me “well you should’ve got the persons name that you spoke with,” they checked the system & they said that someone modified their name on the notes. I am very angry, because I waited 1hr in my car for this appointment and plus I missed work just for them to tell me that I have to pay a big amount of money. I am very disappointed...<//Text>< Time>

<review>The dentist Taghavi is great, but the front desk staff are rude and disorganized. When I arrived to pick up my dental records and they couldn't locate them,  two of the front desk staff proceeded to speak in Spanish (they assumed because of my blackness I wouldn't  understand them) about printing me an unofficial copy despite my request for my official records 4 weeks in advance. After I called them out on their false assumption,  they admitted to not having my records ready and tried to say I never submitted the request. Then they magically found my request but don't know why it wasn't completed. I DO NOT recommend this place. The office staff have also been rude over the phone (with the exception of Donnie who is one of the front desk managers).< /review>< Pics>

Dr. Piehl  is amazing! I am very happy with my  implant and he has calmed all my fears! He has explained this complicated process with clarity , and his work is 5 stars! I was extremely nervous about getting the procedure done on my front upper tooth and was afraid my smile would never be the same, but thanks to him I am good to go! Would definitely recommend him!!!</Review>

I was afraid to go to the dentist for many years. I had really bad teeth and could not smile for a few years. I went here and they were patient and understanding. They went slow or fast depending on what I wanted and we finally got me to smile again. I have more than new teeth and a smile. I have life in me again thanks to the team here at schnierow dental. I totally recommend this place for good affordable dental care.<//text>

Horrible service!! Made my son an appt here and waited for over an hour to be seen then was advised that he had to go across the street for services since he was now 19yrs. Not sure why they'd take xrays and have him sit in the cleaning chair only to be told that he couldn't be seen. My son has been coming to Dr Schnierow since getting braces in 2013. You'd think that after their mistakes they'd at least clean his teeth then tell him the next time he'd need to go over to the other side. Not to mention my son is home for a week before heading back to college and when this appt was made over 2 weeks ago, I wasnt advised at that time they couldn't see him. This place has horrible / rude staff. No patient/member courtesy!!< /Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Ive been coming to this place for years and they ALWAYS found so many problems with my teeth.i would never ask what? Or why? Or any questions.i would just swipe my card and they were very nice to me.after finally having it and spending so much money here i decided to put a stop to it and ask why to everything. Thats when i got the worst service ever. They has me sitting here waiting for 4 hrs my questions were never anwserd the supervisor is or pretends to not know the anwser to my questions.very unprofessional i will never go back. One of the staff told the front desk that i will be back another day and the receptionist said "no she doesnt want to be seen here" to bad for schinerow dental care because of their staff members they will keep loosing so much $$$$. Well atleast they are getting paid to talk about soccer and school etc.while their clients are sitting waiting for service.<//Review>< Rate>

They have about 15 Xbox set up for the kids. But only  3 are working. The waiting room has a dirty green carpet. Once you get in to see the dentist it's just a big room. No privacy at all.</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Their is this one hispanic woman with strawberry blonde hair and oversized glasses who terribly hurts my teeth and makes them look worse then they were supposed to be.
I thought this was a dental CARE but clearly they dont have any care unless its the money which i find very stupid. They also make you wait  for a long time and extra paymemts for no reason. And dont go...
We just got started.
Not to mention the fact that all the dentists talk in spanish when theirs a problem so we dont understand which is VERY irritating.
The list could go on but i dont have time to
waste on a some unprofessional dentist i advise you guys to not come their.
Its for your own good!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I definitely recommend Schnierow Dental Care to anyone that needs any form of dental service. I've been a patient with the company for years and they've helped me get the perfect smile I've always wanted.< /Text>

This is the worst office in Hathorne, they are unprofessional, disrspctful, and overall do not care about paitents needs or requests. They treat people with medi-cal as second class citizens and do not care about anyone unless they are rich or have the best insurance. The staff is rude, very un helpful and they act like they are special or you should be kissing thier a$$.

This office offered to use Nitrous Oxide after begging them for my girlfriend. She has extreme dental anxiety and  since they advertise it on the web site, figured NOX would be the best for her experience. They said Medi-cal wont cover it and we would need to pay 250.00 bucks if she wanted it. I tried to explain that it IS covered now if they look at the new handbook,  not to mention, the average cost for NOX is 70.00 up to 100. So they wanted to charge a 3 times average cost to someone on financial assisted medical.

We had an appointment for 3:30, showed up at 3:10 and did not see the dentist till 4:30. They would not listen to anything myself or my girlfriend said about her condition, not to mention, they prescribed her a m dication which she can not take and could kill her. The dentist just said " well you prob should not take this" BEFORE writing her a prescription for it.

This place is a joke and they not only falsely advertise  but they are rude, over priced and not at all for the paitents best interest.<//text>

<Review>I had alot of pain on both of my bottom wisdom teeth, so my father brought me to see Dr. Farid. He was very nice and made me feel comfortable about getting my teeth pulled.I have always been afraid of getting my wisdom teeth pulled so I just put it off until the last minute. I am glad I met Dr. Farid and my visit was the most relaxed dental appointment I ever had.</Review>< Pics>

First and foremost I am a 28 year old women who hasn't been to the dentist in YEARS since I was in middle school. I have always been afraid of the dentist because of the pain, however, for the past year I had been looking into getting braces to correct my teeth and feel more comfortable smiling.

I visited an ortho in the city of Lawndale who noticed a dark spot on my gums and informed me before they can proceed I would need to get it checked out. I was pissed. Well because my boyfriend has visited Schinerow Dental care the past year I decided to make appointment to have them clear me hahaha well it wasn't that easy.

August 2017 I visited their office and the dentist that assisted me was Dr.Bhalla. I told her listen I'm here to get cleared to get braces I dont need any work done just need you to okay it LOL well it didnt work that way. She did an xray and told me this is what needs to be done in order for you to be cleared.... I needed 5 fillings (but ended up getting 4), 3 extraction (two pre molars for braces & one baby tooth) but I ended up getting 5 one wisdom tooth that was bothering me and turns out I also had a cyst (which was what the ortho seen) and that needed to be removed with the tooth and I had to get a bone graph LORD....

BUT, I say all of this to say that through it all Dr.Bhalla was AMAZING she was very pleasant did everything she said she would and there was NO PAIN DURING OR AFTER ANY MY PROCEDURES. I was finally cleared to get braces on 11/3/17 and it was the best day of my life.

I also want to say thank you to KIM she was another amazing person at the office helping me with all my payments and insurance information. I'm not sure why this doctor office has bad reviews because they are AMAZING I cant recall one bad experience and I was in there office literally once a week for 3 months straight. hmmm Maybe it's not the office but the people that are visiting because this office is amazing as well as the staff.

Thank you Dr.Bhalla (primary dentist), Dr. Bassem Farid (the best oral surgeon) and also Jenny and Kim< /Text>< user_name>

<rate>1</rate><Review>It seems at first when you first visit the dental office they treat you very well but I come to see and feel that once they have treated you and have your insurance they change there service like if they almost to say that we have you I have VERY unprofessional customer service one in mind is a very  frustrated  and taunting individual. Her name is Marisol. I have had very bad customer in the past mainly in retail, but never like this person in the dental field. I have called to talk to a superior but they only transfer me to a leave a message. No one has tried to call me back on this issue i have spoken to others that are patients there and past patients and they also feel like they have had unnecessary dental work and have over charged them or there insurance. Besides the bad customer service that is very fake i do not recommend this place at all. There are other honest dental offices that are far superior than  this place.

I went to schnierow for 4 years because i was a kid in high school but i would have rather not gone here if i could have helped it. There are other places that don't charge a fee if you cannot make an appointment OR if schnierow doesnt call to confirm your appointmemt. With an appointment, you wait outside in the waiting room for 1 hour and then get called in and wait another hour or so to get to the dentist's chair where you wait another 15 minutes for the dentist to see you. And then they bill you a fee for not making an appointment that they never confirmed. That is BS.  Since then i go to another dentist (Summer Smile Dental) that explains everything and photographs anything my teeth need work on and i am a happy client.
Never again with Schnierow dental.<//Text>

< review>
I've been taking my children for 10yrs to Dr Schneirow and became dissatisfied with there service just recently. My 7yr old requires crowns on the front of his teeth. After meeting with the dentist she recommended different options. However, none of the options sounded great to me since the options all geared around sliver teeth..which we know are not very pretty..I spend alot of money for my PPO insurance ..so I had a 2nd opinion with another children's dentist who advised me of nu smile white crowns..and that sounded great!! So I contacted dr schneirow to see if they could provide this service, since I've been with them for yrs and wanted to stay (their staff is GREAT!!)..and was told they only do silver on baby teeth..NOT good! Silver front teeth look horrible. This ofc is not hip to modern technology and I would not recommend this place to anyone with great dental insurance!< /review>

Ravin & Sam are wonderful! Ravin' s Donuts is the BEST in the High Desert! Their donuts are delicious. The donut are airy and not dense and greasy. They also have delicious shaved ice and smoothies with boba, my favorite is Thai tea.  I also love getting the Colossal donut as a birthday cake alternative. Everyone that I have bought the colossal donut for their birthday loves it.</Review>

<Text>Really yummy donuts!! Had a custard filled donut. Never been to a place that actually fills the donut until it's ready to burst!! Filling in every bite!! We went later in the day on Valentine's day and it tasted so fresh!! Will be going back!!

Side note....they make the most creative and adorable donuts. Not just the regular kind. Check out their posts on FB!!<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c364335e82ac7d:0x3fcced9ac5fff8d3<//gmap_id>< userid>

Came here with my sister we were pleasantly surprised. green juice is off the chain best I've had. Doughnuts were excellent. Beware the sandwiches are huge can't even finish half of one. Great for sharing and very tasty. Thank you for the quality experience we were highly pleased.<//Text>

<Text>It is a great donut shop. Their donuts are quite delicious and tasty. They have a good variety of donuts to choose from. Furthermore, they have several choices of sandwiches, and in the mornings they sell coffee. The prices at this establishment are quite fair. Definitely, if anyone is in High Desert area, I would recommend to stop by this shop, and purchase some donuts.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1565111981329, 'text': 'Thank you for your reviews and rating.

Staff are friendly and helpful with suggestions. They make shakes from your ice cream selection🥰. The shakes ate so creamy & smooth! There's shaved ice & donuts too. Stop by to treat yourself any time of the year!< /review>

<review>Took a group of family members to Ravin’s and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. There were lots of delicious donuts to choose from, and they have about 12 ice cream flavors, as well as shaved ice. The ice cream scoops are plentiful, we literally got one scoop and it was HUGE.

There are gluten free options for the ice cream (not cones) but they do not have gluten free baked food options and there are no menu items for vegan diets. We were served quickly and has great conversation with the owners while enjoying our ice cream. We’ve been about 5 times and will definitely make it a frequent summer pit stop!<//review><username>xo Tatiana</username><user>107260642350387282856<//user><rating>5<//rating>< GmapID>

<Text>A cute ma and pa place but trying to get a recommendation from the lady working was like pulling teeth. I came here and asked what was the best donut and she said ‘all of them’ well which can you recommend? ‘All’ okay then what’s the most popular? Finally she tells me glaze- lol.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Ravin's has absolutely the best donuts in Victorville Beyond none! I tried the rest and now I stay with the best, always fresh, delicious Donuts. He has bear claws as well and always some kind of specialty donut. There's no need to go anywhere else if you're in Victorville and they're very easy to find! And don't forget the ice cream if that's what you have a hunger for tonight!< /Review><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c364335e82ac7d:0x3fcced9ac5fff8d3< /GmapID><user_name>Tim Harris< /user_name><UserId.>114084527065890012191<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely the best dounuts in the high desert! The family who owns it are always kind and very nice. The donuts always taste fresh and they have pretty much anything you would want to eat along with your donut. I always go for the maple bars cronuts, I would drive across town any day just to get a donut from them!<//review>

The donuts and desserts are always fresh, the gigantic donuts filled with Whipped Cream are excellent shared treats, and they have a variety of drinks, desserts, and treats. My favorite are the shaved ice cups, which can be difficult to find in the High Desert, and I'm pretty sure they have Thrifty's ice cream which is always the best. You can't go wrong at Ravin's! And the owners and attendants are super nice!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1554834053348, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to give us your rating and reviews.'}< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>The doughnuts here are almost always really fresh. Most of the times I've been here I've been greeted by the owner very kindly. Other times younger kids have been the ones to serve me and I'm sure they've had a long day but have been really rude.

But If you want a sweet treat try one of their doughnuts. Also a great place to to enjoy whatever it is you bought. They have a few chairs and tables to sit at.</Review>< response>

This place is great. The hospitality is what draws me back more than anything. I hadn't been there in over a year and they still remembered me and my family. Mr. Phon was even so kind as to help me out to the car when he saw I had my hands full with my three daughters and my purchases. I told him I had it, and he said he wasn't busy and not to worry. This type of courtesy is lost on today's world, and it's the little things like that that make this place great.< /text>

Honestly my favorite donut shop out of any that I have ever been to. Sam is the nicest and always makes sure you're happy, I have never had a bad experience here and I enjoy coming here regularly. I have no idea how people can go to chain places like Krispy Kreme (which sucks) when an amazing place like this is half a mile away. One of the best places in town and the best service you can find anywhere.<//Review>

You know, I've always seen this donut shop on my route like everyday but I never bother checking out until today.  My wife had the munchies and wanted to get some donuts and bubble tea. The owner is amicable, an alright guy, so customer service was not an issue. Anyway after we had left and arrived at home, upon inspecting my order, I noticed that he got my order wrong because I had a few extra ones that I didn't ask and my order was incomplete, for example, I had order plain ones, glazed ones, chocolate ones, chocolate chip ones, etc. Out of the ones I had order, I had 3 types that were not given to me and instead he had giving me some other ones that I didn't recall asking for. On top of that, the donuts I did ordered didn't taste very fresh. They taste like if they were days old.  I'm not really happy about it, neither was my wife. This was really a disappointing experience for me, seeing it was first and last time to this shop, I'm just going to stick Winchell's or yum yum instead. again, the customer service is good, the ambient is alright but the donuts leave much to be desired and I'm really disappointed that my favorite donuts were not given to me despite the fact that I clearly recall asking the owner (specifically, I might add) to include them to my order but instead got some other donuts that weren't that fresh nor tasty.<//review>

We love this place! It's a friendly mom and pop type business with lots of yummy stuff!  My favorite is the chamango and my daughter loves the shaved ice with all the fun flavor choices. Don't forget about the donuts too because they are delicious!</Text>

You must try their croissant sandwiches! They bake the bread in house and top it a mile high with meats and cheeses. Don't forget the jalapenos=P a donut shop that does it all =]]</review>

Can get massive donuts, and cake donuts. Chamango, croissant sandwiches, Mexican/American candy, the only downside is the location, quite a few shady people in the parking lot, and it's next to a liquor store.

<review>There are, in all the universe, only four reasons to get off Interstate 15 and stop in Victorville.

Perhaps, like me, a loved one lives there. More likely, you need gasoline or a quick hit of meth from one of the many dealers who seem to make up Victorville's primary industry

The fourth reason, and the best reason, to get off the freeway in Victorville is this donut shop.

The donuts are consistently fresh, they don't have that corporate taste, for lack of a better phrase, that you find at Krispy Kreme, and the people who run the place are just as charming as can be.

My personal order of choice: Two maple cake donuts and a pint of milk to go.

Not only is it healthier than meth, but it tastes better too.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I love this place. I remember when it opened, I would do laundry next door every Friday and would come here with my mom and sister. The owners are great and they had an employee, who, at the time, worked 7 days a week. But she was always nice to us, nobody was ever rude to us there. The doughnuts are as good as it gets. The sandwiches are awesome, the nachos, the boba, I love everything they've got. I recently saw people excited about krispy kreme opening up but I'm really hoping people give Ravin's a shot first, you won't be disappointed.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

We caught different kinds of sharks, halibut, and a couple different kinds of bass. *All sharks & fish under sized were returned to the ocean (: * Just wanted to send a big thank you for a trip we will never forget!

The owner of this charter boat is awesome. A Captain who was paid to do a charter refused to take a party out fishing and used racial slurs and lied about the party to the police to get a negative response towards the paying customers.

The owner fired the captain and is making it right to the customers. The whole incident occurred on YouTube Live of the captain suing racial slurs and even told the police when they refused to do anything to the paying party that he hopes they get a hot one. Meaning he hopes they get shot.

That captain has some serious issues. The owner recognized that and terminated his employment. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CHARTER BOAT!! The next time I am in San Diego I will definitely make it a point to use them for some awesome deep sea fishing. You should too.< /review>

I am an avid fisherman from Florida. A recent event proved to me just how sincere this man is about what he does. If I ever have the time when I'm in the area, I guarantee I will book a trip with them.
Hook me up on some of that halibut. Maybe a tuna too.
In my opinion you should have a 5 star rating.< /review>

I booked the 42 ft boat for local offshore & kelp fishing. We were taken out in a 31 foot. If the boat I booked was not available, why was I able to book it online? More importantly, our captain never left the bay. Again, I booked local offshore/kelp bed (My receipt says the same) as described on your web site.  I could have rented a pontoon boat on my own & bottom fished San Diego bay! Also, our “Capt” had zero idea how to operate the boat (apparently the owner sends inexperienced contractors to operate his boat). Twin 225s tilled up. Boat never went over 10 mph. Guys working the bait barge had to tell the Capt that his props were out of the water. We also fished the same 100 yard area of the bay all day. Lastly, the Capt never offered to clean the one fish we were able to keep. Trip was not what I bought. I’ll pay for fishing all day & I know there’s never a guarantee of fish, however, not taking a customer on the actual trip booked is not acceptable. DO NOT use this charter service!< /text>

I can’t believe it, we all caught Halibuts, 1 being a 15lb keeper.

The boat is awesome and very comfy. I would recommend the half day trip for a young family.

I am editing this review. People make a reservation put a down payment of about $500 the captain shows up over an hour late! Then won't allow the people on his boat! Then calls the cops and won't give back their deposit!. The owner found out almost immediately fired the so-called captain on the spot! The owner is making it up to the people that made the reservation<//text>

We caught fish and had a great day. Any day on the water is better than sitting at home. I wish we had more time fishing and less time moving. We spent about 2 hours out of it so hours moving. I know it's called fishing not catching but I was hoping Mike would have put us on some better quality fish. There was only one keeper for the whole day with 6 people fishing. The boat was a little dirty. Could use a little cleaning but for the most part it was ok.<//review>

Had a great time fishing with friends and family on The Long Run. Ross was our deck hand,  he was the hardest working and most helpful guy we could have asked for. They put us on the fish and we caught over twenty tuna that day. Overall it was a great trip and I highly recommend them!<//text>

Captain Chris Anderson and the Deck hand Rainbow were awesome!! It was like being with your friends that knew where the fish were.  I highly recommend this outfit and crew.  Us guys on the boat were ready to go offshore but the lady’s chose inshore and we still had a blast. Captain Chris knows all the different  spots and Rainbow is the icing on the cake.  Fish count for the day... (5) Halibut (2) Sand bass.   Thank you for a great day on the water 🤙🏽.

This was the best fishing experience of my life. Granted I don't fish often, but I may start going more after this experience.

The start of the trip I told Captain Nathan I hadn't had much luck catching fish in my life and he guaranteed me we would find some. He displayed incredible knowledge chasing down the spots where he somehow knew where fish were. He was extremely helpful and patient with me as I was learning all the basics of fishing and, as promised, I caught a grip of fish; what a rush. My cousin, who is an experienced fisherman, had an equally great experience. It's nice having a boat that isn't packed with people. There was plenty of room to wander to opposite sides of the deck and get some solo time while I was fishing.

I feel like there's a lot of boats you can go out on in the area and it's about selecting the one that will give you the best experience. In my opinion The Long Run is the best choice out there.<//Text>

<review>boy did we have fun on THE LONG RUN boat! Nathan had different options of boats that we could take out to accommodate my  group, I chose THE LONG RUN, I was very happy with the boat and the crew! we went to the 9 mile bank holding Mexican fishing permits and caught fish inside US and Mexican waters! What a day! Family had a super fun time fishing in San Diego! Will Be Back!< /review><UserId.>107847800092478090276</UserId.>< Name>

My friends and I chartered the Long Run with Captain Nathan for 1/2 day trip. He and his crew were awesome and put us on the fish. Our trip yielded several halibut (4 keepers) and some fun leopard shark fishing which was totally unexpected. As novice fisherman, we could not have asked for a better experience in San Diego Bay. The professionalism and service provided by this crew was top notch and all of us look forward to doing it again.<//Text>

<user_name>Rick Fowler<//user_name><date>1529948508943</date><rate>1<//rate><review>This trip was a gift for my grandson, his first deep sea fishing trip. I verified with Nathan the day before our trip we were on our way and requested location information and what licenses we needed. He gave license info and verified wrong info on how many aglers we had. I told him correct number and he said I didn't pay enough for four anglers (the additional 1 person would have doubled my fee!) And there was no room for the additional person as there were already 3 other people signed up.

I had to send a copy of my receipt to prove what I signed up for and he said he had us down for the wrong trip. No offer to fix it.

I told him I needed it fixed. He told me (after several hours) to contact another company. I did, very nice people, however, it turned out the captain was inexperienced and nearly hit a concrete pier. I signed up for a yellow tail trip but they talked my guests into staying in the bay. Promised we would catch more fish, they were "killing" them in the bay.

We caught two small fish, not keepers, all day. I did not get what I paid for, not even an apology from Nate. Would have done better on a party boat. Spend your money someplace else.< /review>< Pictures>

He claims you are upset because you stood in for a deckhand one day and want more work. It seems you have threatened Ross to give you more hours or you would “throw us under the bus” as you put it. Why in the world would you try to hurt my company and take me down due to and issue with you and Ross?  I heard he was working in the bilge and you fell but that’s certainly not a reason to try to take my business down. I’ve never had a problem with you but this is very strange and unwarranted.

He was a temporary employee until we learned he was compromised with erratic behavior. He is threatening to ruin our reputation and saying he will make me pay. I have documentation of his name on manifests and payment receipts recorded on our log. He is now stating he has no affiliation with Ross, my Captain, who hired him or my business, but I have recorded texts written between Ross and him that illustrate otherwise. He says he can’t work (although he has for us on 4 occasions) because he is on disability and collecting from the government and now is attempting to state he was injured on the job even though he said via text he is fine it was just a bump and no big deal.  I have text record of all of this...  I have deduced that Jesses Method of Operation is to take advantage of others to file erroneous lawsuits or disability claims and get paid rather than work an honest living.\n\nI have reviews stating Jesse was a deckhand by my clients although he denies working for us.'}<//Resp>

This was the best part of our trip to San Diego!! I contacted Nathan prior to my trip to San Diego and he answered every single one of my questions and assured me that I would have a great time- and he was right! Our deckhand was Mike and our Captian was Gregg- we couldn't have asked for a better crew! Both gentleman are so knowledgeable in everything that had to do with fishing. (They have both professionally fished all over the world and US!) From the type of fish we were catching to the operations of the boat- Mike and Gregg were total professionals! They were also so personable and funny- it make the trip amazing! We even caught a Mantis Shrimp, which was awesome!!
Thank you to Nathan, Mike and Gregg for making this such an amazing experience for my family and I. I recommend them to anyone looking for an unforgettable experience in San Diego! Top notch crew and top notch operation! :) :)
P.S. Don't forget to tip your Captain and deckhand! They worked so hard to make sure that we were having an amazing time and they absolutely deserve to be tipped!</Review>

Had a great time on the 6 hour fishing trip. We went offshore at first but didn't get much action there. Then, Mike, our deckhand suggested we go back into the bay and we had a lot more luck. He really knows what he is talking about! We caught a bunch of spotted bay bass and two keeper halibut!!! Mike was super helpful and nice. Beautiful day on the water, great boat. Would definitely recommend.<//text>

< Review>
I recently picked up fishing as something to get-out-and-do. I've been on three different fishing tours with three different guides. One was disastrous. Another was much better, which I though was good, until I tried The Long Run Sportfishing (TLRS). I've gone out with them twice now, the first time was hands down the best fishing trip I've been on. The guides were helpful. The fishing was great, caught a yellowfin and later a halibut. The other customers were positive and friendly. The boat, gear, and tackle were all in good order and well kept. But also, the crew were professional while still easygoing and knowledgeable. So I went out again a month later with TLRS. My experience was almost as good, the only difference was the fish weren't as accommodating for the first part of the day. The Captain took us to a different spot which really made a difference to the day. Of course the Captain and the crew can't control the fish or where they will be, but they did a great job with how it all played out.
If you are looking for a one-off fishing trip or if you are looking for more frequent trips with a good organization. I would highly recommend The Long Run Sportfishing as the sport fishing guides to get it done, and done well. Cheers!</Review>

This was my first private charter and I didn't really know what to expect. I have read reviews about salty captains and crew members on other six packs so I was a little hesitant about booking this 12 hour trip. The captain, Brendan, and crew members John and Carson made me feel like we were old pals:) Crew was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Owner Nathan also provided all of the information I requested via MULTIPLE emails and texts:) He is very accommodating and I will definitely fish on this boat again. Everybody went home with fillets, whether they hooked up or not. They supply all of the gear, AND bait, AND tackle -- and let me tell you, you will not be disappointed by the array of rods, reels and jigs. The boat itself is very comfy. I took a few power naps and was able to store my food and beverages in their fridge. I can't wait to go again.</review>

<Review>Well let’s say by we rented out the whole fleet. They told us don’t worry about food and drinks and everything is taking care of. Nope, had to pay for our bait fish. Didn’t even go deep sea fishing but call it in-shore bay fishing. We got lucky that we brought our own drinks or we would’ve died. 3 boats, no drinks and no food. Not only that, they caption called day of and said he got food poisoning and so we waited longer for another person to come. Spent over 3k for couple small size fish in the bay. I could’ve went to the fish market to have a better experience. I swear they husseled us. Telling us we been getting big tuna and this and that. What a joke!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This is a great way to experience the views at San Diego Harbor.  The crew is friendly, tackle and bait is provided.  Their dock is located close to San Diego Airport at Harbor Island, making it convenient and memorable to try while on vacation.  It is a great deal to get a boat trip with such a limited (6 passengers max) amount of people on board.</Text>

<Name>Michael Midgley</Name><Text>Showed up bright and early for my groups 6 hour half day trip. Parking is a breeze as there is free parking lot across the street from the marina. The captain greeted us at the marina office and we headed to the boat. After the safety orientation we picked up some live bait and went to fish in the kelp. Mostly did some bottom fishing, got quite a few rockfish and hooked into something really big that got away. The crew was very helpful and informative and the boat was clean and organized. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>My 6th year fishing with Nathan and The long run, Im never disappointed! They are the ultimate hosts every fisherman should experience. Nathan is the most  Knowledgeable and competent captain I have ever fished with in my nearly 35 years of fishing (started at age 4 and still going strong).
I highly recommend the long run, they take care of EVERYTHING,  that's what I enjoy the most!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I had an amazing time on The Long Run with Woody and Rick! Caught some Shovel Sharks, enjoyed the SD breeze, and took in the amazing views of the skyline of San Diego. As a first time fisher, they were great with giving us pointers on the proper techniques, helped us reel fish in and made sure to keep moving so we could follow where the fish were.  I had such a great experience and am looking forward to my next trip!</Review>

Had a good time. Full day shark fishing, almost 13 hrs! Didn't catch any shark but did catch some rock fish at the end of the day. The four of us had a relaxing time on the boat. Captain did a great job and nice to hang out with. Some misunderstanding about food being taken care of didn't happen. Were told to just bring some beer if we wanted to and everything else would be taken care of. Captain was unaware of that and said if we requested food then they would have had a second person to prepare food for us. We were satisfied with the experience just not satisfied going hungry.</Review>

Both Captains Rick Kelly and Michael Wood "Woody" along with owner Nathan Beall, have over 100 years combined professional experience in local waters.  The boat is roomy and comfortable and quiet with very little to no smell of diesel fumes.  This boat brings the big fish home.  Check out the photo gallery and see for yourself.<//text></record>

Rick and Scott where absolutely wonderful! We where not able to fish in the ocean due to the large swells, but Rick and Scott would not let that ruin our day. They took us fishing in the bay and made sure we caught some fish. They both made sure that everyone was happy. I don't know what more to say but WOW! I would recommend going with those 2 and we will definitely go again with them when we return to San Diego!<//review>

<Text>Captain was a little late when everyone else on the boat was waiting for him. The toilets were absolutely disgusting. A member on the boat caught a halibut (22 lbs) and the person who caught it didn't want any, so our group of 3 were going to take it all home, the Captain asked is he could "have a piece or two" and we agreed he could, but when we got to our hotel we noticed he took 2 whole fillets... so about 8 lbs of halibut!!!!! Best of luck to this company.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I had one of my best experience boat trip with The Long Run Sportfishing today. The crew Captain Clinton & Captain Aaron were very experienced and helpful, very friendly and nice people. I enjoyed my trip. My special thank you to Captain Beall for all arrangements and great organizations, he sent me information I needed to know about food, meds cloths, ...etc right before the trip. Even I just decided to go fishing trip last night they all helped me to get to the boat right on time. Captain Beall made it happened with a great advice and responded all my inquires.
This was a great memory for me from San Diego before I leave this city. Thank you "The Long Run Sportfishing" team for this great experience.</Text>

I enjoyed the boat ride more than fishing itself. I've been on better fishing boats for least expensive, but enjoyed having a smaller group. Directions and itinerary could be more precise and professionally laid out (they sent me a screenshot of a text message by email) and calling the captain 1-2 days before was inconvienent. Staff brought up tipping on several occasions. I would add this aspect of the trip to the Groupon page or website if its expected.. While i respect that closed mouths go hungry, bringing up tipping is tacky. Overall a good time👍</review>< Pictures>

<text>Just finished an awesome 18 hour trip with Nathan on The Long Run~  He is a talented fisherman with over 25 years of experience and it showed.  With in a few hours of trolling we hooked up a nice blue fin tuna and finished the trip with 9 20+ pound yellowfin tuna.  The boat is 40 feet long and you can walk around the entire boat giving you plenty of fishing area.  If deep sea fishing is not your thing they offer nice local halibut and bass fishing in San Diego Bay and La Jolla Kelp beds as well.  Thank you Nathan!  Will definitely do it again!</text>< user>

<Text>Just walked off the boat and my husband and I are  absolutely  amazed at how much fun we had. Capt Rick and Blake  were AMAZING. First 5 minutes we had both caught a yellow tail and it got better as the morning went on. We saw a hammerhead shark and several sea lions.  As the morning went on the fishing got better and better, yellowtail, bonita, and calico sea bass were all over the place it seems.  Captain Rick and Blake are true professionals and we would not hesitate to recommend them to our friends and family.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Mustang....mustang....We went out for fishing 2,5 day on mustang boat but they left the marina 4 hours later on their schedule. That’s why we didn’t have the right time to catch the fishes. ( other boats did really good on the fishing report- most of boat hit the limited)
I spent more than $1700 for this trip and got nothings on the end.

<GmapID>0x80deab132de044e9:0x9f87fe892b51f233</GmapID><Name>Monica L< /Name><Text>I purchased this 6 hour trip for my husband and dad for Father's Day. The directions for the morning of trip were inaccurate. We arrived early, no one was at the assigned gate and an ice chest loaded with drinks had to moved several times as staff finally arrived at a different gate and they figured out which boat to take that would fit all the customers (first boat was too small). The final boat was dirty with trash cans full of the previous day's beer cans and needed to be spayed down to clean it before leaving and the gas gauge was 1/4 full. The first stop was to get bait and then the boat returned to the bay, citing rough water and sick customers from the day before, as a reason they would not go further than the bay. The instructions given to customers advised motion sickness medication so this was a lame excuse (all of this trip's customers had meds). It was more likely that there was not enough gas. By the time fishing started, it was 2 hours later and after 3.5 hours,  it was time to head back. So this was NOT a six hour trip. Yes, fish were caught (2 tasty ones) and the guy helping bait lines and filet the fish was awesome. We contacted the company owner and he apologized for the condition of the boat and confusion to board the correct boat. Apparently he contracts with other boats to take customers and they have smaller boats. He offered a repeat trip with only a $25 discount on his own boat that is larger and can handle winds that may cause motion illness, and it is faster as well, so there would be more time to actually fish. No thank you. I didn't know I was getting a substandard substitute experience when I booked the trip.< /Text><resp>None< /resp><time>1466292757599<//time><user_id>107893506687289733762<//user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><rating>2<//rating></record>

<Review>We had so much fun on The Long Run! Nathan was very knowledgable and informative knowing where and when to catch whatever's in season. During my trip I caught a mako shark which Nathan had to help me reel in of course! He cleaned and filleted it for us back at the dock.  A great experience to say the least and looking forward to booking future trips because we really had a great time :)<//Review><user_id>102644075524342541746</user_id>< resp>

First all we caught fish so mission accomplished but, we did a 18 hr trip on the boat we left around 130 am went and go bait blah blah blah time to get some rest so could get up at 5ish and start fishing. Lol think again the 4 bunks pictured online are the boats starage room so we slept at the table with legs on ice chests. The bait was distressed by 9 am as the bait tank is too small or overcrowded i dont know but most all the fish were no longer swimming by 1 and its in the way of prime fishing space on rear of boat. The railing is kinda sketchy it seems too low to be trying to catch a 30 lb tuna, I was more preoccupied by trying not to fall in then real in a fish. Blake knows his fishing and can see a kelp Patty from a half mile away. Larry our captain is the new most interesting guy on earth he explained all my stupid questions and threw one line out the whole trip and caught a 25lb tuna. All in all boat is great for a day trip not an over night. crew was all I could ask for they knew where and how to get the fish. Thus 4 out of 5. It was an awesome trip il never forget. Thanks Larry and Blake</text>

<review>Amapola Rico taco is a great place for good Mexican food. They have the best bean and cheese burritos, which is our favorite,  and reason we go here. Its quaint, in a gas station, and its location for customer traffic is horrible. However, if you are stopping for gas right off the exit, 76 is top of the line gas, and Amapola is top of the line burritos!  But, if you don't need gas, stop anyway, and you won't be disappointed. Something about their beans is awesome. Ask for the regular, not the small ones, bean & cheese burritos,  about 7$ for two, and you will be full . Enjoy!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I have enjoyed the food served at 2 of their restaurants but this location at the gas station just does not meet the Amapola Rico Taco standards. Both the tacos and the burritos I tried here were somewhat light. I don't remember standing a burrito on it's "edge", see the picture I attached. The tacos, biggest thing in them were the tomatoes. Not to mention all three shells were broken way too much.</text>

I stopped in for a late night munchie, I was a little confused as to where the restaurant was. It is located inside the convenience store. While they were getting ready to close, the workers were helpful and attentive. They also informed me of taco Tuesday. The combination burrito was good and tasty.< /Text>

<review>The food is amazing. I highly recommend their pork cheese friends and their chicharonne tacos. Food is a bit pricey but it is well worth it

Update. I am sorry to say but their service has just worsen. This will be twice they forget more than two items I ordered. Also they didn't even include silverware or hot sauce. It was also impossible to reach them and Express my concern.  Wont be coming back to this location hopefully the other locations aren't like this one.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c355346b4a4fdd:0xa89851d6cd5b5cac<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>I love love there food!! Best Mexican food around!! I go to different areas depending where I am. I have been to every location around this area. This location on the other hand, needs to get better with ordering on the phone. I tried ordering before I left on my lunch break. At first no one said anything. I called back and I couldn’t hear what the lady was saying and I asked, “I am sorry?” I couldn’t hear. In the beginning of the call I asked if she could hear me and letting her know that my service isn’t very well. She responded but then It was quite so I am guessing I was on hold. While this whole time, I finally got to the restaurant. It was super dead no one was in line or anything and for some reason I was still on hold. All I wanted was to enjoy my food on my lunch break. Just pick up pay and leave instead of waiting taking my time away.
BUT THERE FOOD!!! Omg, I love their pork fries!!!<//review>< Pictures>

The Amapola inside the 76 gas station in Highland, is the best amapola around. The food is always fresh and never over cooked and the service is always friendly. I have not had a bad experience in the years that i have been coming here. Awesome!</review>

<review>Asked for carne asada fries, got some other meat. I tried it anyway, it was gross. Girl at the register had some type of attitude, idk if it was me or she was having a bad day.
Would not recommend, wasted $10 on food I didn't want, food I didn't order.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The person who took my order was more concerned with her phone call then doing her job. She got my order wrong. Didn't realize it till after I got back home. Then when I went back she refused to fix the mess up even after a area manager told her too. I suggest everyone stays away from this place until this employee is no longer employed by this company.<//Review>< pics>

The food is great here but prices are a little to much.  The customer service is ok, not the best.  But they do close early on several occasions.  So I end up going to the one open 24 hours on Baseline/My. Vernon.< /Text>

This place is clearly one of the coolest place in the neighborhood. Whenever I come to this place I am remarkably glad. They hold their high  standard service and the highest level of meals  they offer. You will be always satisfied with this place. Very  recommended.</Review>

We had the Pitt burger, fries, and handmade milkshakes.  They have lots of other options such as chicken strips, tacos, hot dogs, and some delicious onion rings. We will be going back for more this Summer.<//review>< pictures>

When I was 20 and my sister was 19 we bought are first car together so we could go from susanville to fall river to get Frosty food. So I love it. It was my first fast food and comfort food now.

Fall River Mills is a one horse town if you catch my drift and Frosty is the perfect pairing for it. You must eat here if passing through. Great burgers at a great price. Welcoming kitchen and I think the dining area suits the town perfectly. Absolutely loved our visit herr< /text>

How do they pass Inspections?? The business looks like a run down, dirty, little shack. It doesn't take a whole lot to repaint, new patio tables & benches, nice flower pots with flowers, not pots with weeds, weed eat, clean inside,  with new flooring, etc. Ya gotta put some money back into a business!!! Take a liitle pride !!!<//text>

<Review>Saw good reviews so I went. Pulled up to find graffiti on its building and was located between a 7-11 and liquor store—not to reassuring but shouldn’t judge a book by the cover.
Walked my wife in who was in severe pain, they yelled at us to stay outside as they screen us for Covid. “That’s ok, they’re just doing their job,” I tell myself “no Covid symptoms just severe stomach pain, might be an ulcer!” Was our response.
They said it would take a really long time to be seen there and we should go to an emergency room. There was not a single person in the waiting room! Seemed like they just wanted to turn people away.  We happily drove to Kaiser instead and got actual help.< /Review>< response>

My family of 3 got tested back in July after being around someone who tested positive (thank God we were negative & that person recovered fully). And now testing again. Video conference went much smoother this second time around (July video conference did not work). Getting tested today at 1:30p (according to the health care worker on my video conference 3day test more accurate for those with no symptoms)<//Text>

Other than trying to figure out how they were doing things due to covid, and not being able get through on the phone because of high call volume, once I was in the door it was really quick compared to my previous experiences at various other urgent care centers. From the time I walked out of my house to the time I walked back in the door at home after my appointment all took an hour (granted I'm lucky enough to only live a 4 min drive away). And Matt The P. A. I saw was nice, easy to understand, and thorough!<//text>

Apathetic staff.

Advice from the PA: ‘ ice and heat do NOT help reduce swelling’.

Took two weeks for them to submit information to get an X-ray.

Didn’t follow through with commitments to contact radiology center or my insurance company.

do not recommend going here.<//Review>

Good service. Better than these other Covid-testing centers. I can’t even get tested at a minute clinic. Why can’t everybody just stay on the house? It’s the best way to prevent you from contacting Covid.< /Text>

The video conference was initiated more promptly that I was expecting to occur, there were fewer questions asked of me than I anticipated taking place, and the individual I had my conference with arranged a very convenient time and location for me to have my appointment at. What's not to like?</Text>

Didn't know this was a private urgent care so there is no hospital network that it is tied to so that is something I'm not used to that when trying to have results from an xray sent to them when I could see it on my patient portal before the xray place was closed for the weekend. But I know this isn't their fault. I'm new to area (from the east coast) and just wanted to avoid a $150 copay at an ER but wanted a fast turnaround time for a possible broken ankle. The urgent care definitely made up for it and helped walk me through getting on their patient portal again since I misplaced the code and making sure I had my MRI paperwork before getting off the phone with me. He was very friendly and helpful.</Text>

There is a pandemic. I had a cold. Some of my family are immunocompromised. My doctor says I should get a Covid test, my insurance provider says it is fully paid for. I call Instant Urgent Care because I live a block away. They need me to see their doctor first. It seems odd, that there is a barrier to getting tested, but fine. It is morning, when can I see a doctor, 2:50pm is the next available appointment. Now I have to download their app, fine. Log in and it says we are waiting for your provider. 30 minutes after my appointment was to begin, I begin to call to see what is the delay. It goes to voicemail 5 times. 45 minutes after my appointment was to begin they answer the phone and say they do not see me as logged into the system. I close and open their app and they finally see me, but there was no way for me to know that they couldn’t see me while I sat in front of my video call for 45 minutes! Then I was told to be patient... thanks.
I eventually talked to a doctor who asked simple questions and said they would schedule me a test, but that they are just now stopping testing for the day.
These delays will cause people to not get tested. These delays do not help if we are all trying to fight this pandemic. Something in the system needs to change if I can login and wait with no way of knowing that the office cannot see that I have logged in at all. Very frustrating.
24 hour delay is too long.</Review>

<text>Booked a telemedicine appointment to schedule a COVID-19 test. I filled out their required insurance, identity, and credit card forms. I waited in the provided video call for 30 minutes and nobody ever showed up!

Their phone numbers also do not go to anyone.

Update: After 40 minutes, I finally received a phone call setting up the quick-and-easy telemedicine visit. Took just a minute or so to schedule the drive-through COVID-19 test with a friendly provider. 40 minutes without any contact whatsoever is a bit much though.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>My provider was 20 minutes late for our appointment. Instead of a doctor, I was given a nurse practitioner. She spent maybe two minutes talking to me then ordered me a Covid-19 test per my request because I had been exposed to someone with the virus. I was not able to go to work for an entire week while waiting for the results because I work at VA hospital. I emailed them three times asking for a doctors note stating that I was not able to go to work due to having symptoms and possible virus, but they never responded. When I went to review the doctors notes in the portal, there is no information at all about our conversation.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>One of the worst places to deal with for billing and payments. The doctor was great, but if you want billing nightmares, please feel free to go. It has been over 2 months and I'm still waiting for a billing statement or invoice so I can reconcile. It seems like you will keep getting bills with no explanation, or not get any receipt even if you ask for it. If you call them, they always say the billing person is not in today, please call back on Monday or email. After writing 4 emails over 2 months, no one bothered to even acknowledge, let alone send the receipt. If you call on Monday, they say call back next week. How hard is it to email a receipt? I paid cash for a simple checkup at this clinic. What if you had insurance? Your billing nightmare will be severely more pronounced. Avoid this place at all costs. If Dr. Ramandeep Kaur is reading this - you need to move elsewhere. Your website says: "our focus is on you". That's absolute bs. Patient is the least of their concern. How much time one has to waste with you to just get a copy of the receipt or statement?</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

The staff and doctor at the location were pleasant to deal with.
However my experience after that was very poor. They showed complete lack of communication and responsibility; even after mentioning to them the time sensitive nature of my needs.</review>

< Review>
I was potentially exposed to coronavirus. I had a 5 minute teledoc meeting on Friday, with the promise of a follow-up text message with details on how to get tested.  The text message never came, so I called the number on the website.

I spoke to an incredibly rude woman, who cut me off mid-sentence and was nothing short of condescending. She told me to "just show up between noon and 4". When I asked if I needed anything, I got a curt "Just your Drivers License". When I asked where the clinic was located, she rattled off the website URL and told me to go look it up.

I arrived at the clinic at 2:20 pm. All the lights were off, and the door was locked. There was a sign on the door, directing any COVID test patients with a pre-booked appointment around the back, where someone would come out to meet you at your car.... But I had just been told there was no way to book a test, I was just supposed to show up. How does that work?

Long story short, there's no one here, and I'm clearly not getting a test today. Terrible experience all around, and I'll never use this company for any medical attention again.</Review>

<rating>3</rating><text>Booking a time slot on the Same day was easy. Waited half an hour for medical reviewer was frustrating because there is no IM function with Next Patient. The hot line is useless since it's info only without an option to talk to a real person. I texted the message line and finally got some acknowledgement . The interviewer called me directly since she could not log into NextPatient herself. Then I was told rapid test is not PCR  test the airline requires. Somehow that distinction should be called out at the website.< /text>< Pics>

I was very impressed with this Urgent Care as it was my first time coming, I didn’t know what to expect. The woman at the front desk greeted me as I came in and I was taken within 10 minutes of my scheduled appt. The Dr was very nice and gave me valuable information. I will definitely use this facility in the future!< /text>

The one doctor I trust no longer seems to attend, which is fine, but the rest of the staff was VERY unhelpful.

Doctors-- My recent doctor spent 15 minutes explaining why I don't need to get immunization shots and her philosophy on it, and told me incorrect information about my illness that...I've had and managed for 13 years at this point.

The staff:
I'm doing immunization shots, and.. I've been yelled at by receptionists over the phone to come in for a shot, when it was too early to get it. And...I can be wrong, so I go in, wait an hour, the doctor comes in and tells me it's too soon to have a shot. So....I wasted an hour and 10$ co-pay, cool.

So, after 6 months of immunization shots being given to me, I get a print out of what I've had done, and...they did not keep track of them correctly! How!?

Long-story-short, this place has gone down-hill. And it sucks overall. I will never go back there, and you all should avoid this place as well.< /Text>

<text>It was very impressed with the care. My appointment was at 1:15 and I was called in on time. The receptionist was very friendly and even printed out the prescription form for me. The nurse was also very friendly and took good care of me. I also like Doctor Alla. She is great and full of very helpful information.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I went in when I cut my finger and had to Get stitches. I was prepared to be there for a long time, but i was very surprised to be in and out very quickly! Not much waiting time, and everyone was great! Both of my follow up appointments were the same, and everyone working there each time were  all wonderful- front desk staff, nurses, and doctors. Best urgent care experience I’ve ever had and would definitely recommend and go back if needed!</text>

< review>
I visited their office for a throat infection. The doctor(who was not friendly) did routine checkup and a strep test which came out to be negative. I recovered after a few days with the prescribed antibiotics. But later I found that my card was billed twice. As per them one was for the office visit and another was for the strep test which was very minor procedure during the same office visit. I don't understand why this has to be charged separately. Do not recommend!</review>

Very professional, and they were worried for me and Dr. Felix even did a flu testing on me to make sure I didn’t have the flu, but had the cold and prescribed me with some asthma medicine to help with my cold congestion. Will come back another time if needed for any sickness that I have.< /Review>

< Review>
I have visited a few Instant Urgent Care clinics in the South Bay in the past couple years. Here is where my issue was...  I ALWAYS double check if a clinic/ doctor is within my network. ALWAYS! I called this location prior coming in to verify, I was assured that indeed it is all still within network. I even brought my prescription B12 shot to them so I can just get it done at the same time while being treated for a sore throat. When I came in (February), they verified that my info is all up to date, including the insurance information. Charged me my co-pay fee. Treatment wise. It is fine simple, common issue. This month (October), to my surprise I get a charge of over $230! No heads up, no communication, no email, nothing. I call them on a Saturday (the day of the charge) They said billing department will call you back since they can't see that info. Ok fine. Billing department calls back on Monday 2pm, I believe the name is Zaki. Less than 10 minutes later I call them back. They said she's on the phone she'll call you back. 45 minutes no call back. Calling again, "Zaki is not in, umm... I mean she's on the phone! She will call you back!". 4 hours later I haven't received a call back. I call again, Zaki darling left for the day! She'll call you tomorrow! Based on my insurance company they were NOT in network! How come suddenly you're not in network after you verified all my info including knowing my copay amount and charging me with it and then appear not to be in network?! And saving my CC information and charging it with no heads up 7 months after the claim is filed? Ok... I mean based on the speed that dear Zaki from billing is returning my call(s), I can see how fast things are going at this place... As to Dr. Kaur, honestly I don't even think that's her responsibility to check that, but her staff and front desk and if they made a mistake that should've been flagged. Why do I need to flag it 7 months later and not even getting an appropriate timed response from Zaki.</Review>

Let me start out with the good things: check in desk was fast, MA’s were friendly and hospitable.

If you’re coming here with the hopes of feeling better as you’re sick, don’t come here. My 3 minutes with the doctor was the worst bedside manner I have EVER experienced in my entire life. I asked one question and she made me feel like I was the dumbest person for asking. I asked about getting a steroid shot. I didn’t push it or anything. I simply asked and boy did she make me regret opening my mouth. I already feel crappy bc I’m sick but I felt WORSE leaving this urgent care. She even swung the door open when she left and left it open as she stormed out like she was the one to be mad at me for asking a question. I never raised my voice, I didn’t undermine her position, and I was very respectful even though she clearly was not.

The employee that saw me at discharge listened to my complaint about the doctor and assured the situation would be handled. My experience outside of the exam room was 5-Star. Unfortunately, that did not make up for my time during the exam.</text>

Had 2 visits to this place and here's my take,

- Dr. Kaur is very professional and handles your visit with care.
- Both Primary and Urgent care

- Very friendly front desk, always smiling. They are flexible to take you in even at times you are late by few minutes

- Making Appointments are quick in their website or a phone call. Walk-ins welcome.

- Wait time? No. From the time I checked in, I was taken into the room in 5 minutes. Trust me!! Haven't seen any other urgent or primary care practice beat this time.

- The best thing about them is their Patient portal. You get to see your test results, medications, manage appointments , billing, payment, all in one portal account that's created on first visit

- Via the messaging system in the Patient Portal, you can also keep in touch with the Doctor or Office if you need any prescription refills, any questions or concerns.
Trust me again! Dr. Kaur responds same hour or day and even in weekends. This is what I need when I go confused and need a urgent medical clarification

***** They keep up with "INSTANT" in their name :)

Practice is very clean<//Text>

<text>My doctor and assisting staff were excellent!  I especially liked that the exam room is germ free and you could tell that everything had been cleaned as much as possible!  You would never find a hospital that cared enough to make there patient recovery area germ free.  I did not have to wait long in the waiting area and my doctor saw me right away, even though I was very early to the appointment!

<Review>This place earned a 1 star because of the nurse who was helping me with a positive attitude the entire time.
I came in to get my physical exam done for work on Saturday. One of the receptionists here was talking in such a rude manner. One of them said the cost is $139, and then told me to sit down to fill out some paper work. Then the rude one was like “hey you know you have to pay $139?” I mean, I don’t wanna be nitpicking and stuff... but I didn’t sit down and not pull out my card because I didn’t want to pay... lolol
Anyways, so after the nurse guy helped me, the doctor walked in. First of all, she was picking on my answers that I filled out on the paper. She kept yelling at me for saying I don’t know about my family history part. So basically I said I don’t know who has TB in my family but my TB test result was positive and my X-ray was fine. She went up hella close to my face and said “if you don’t know who has it in your family then you put no.” I even showed her an electronic copy of my X-ray result, but she was like “I’m asking you a question, not for that.” Boy, this lady has so much attitude. For a doctor, she is so petty... seriously! Usually, other doctors would just move on. Jesus christ. The entire exam was basically arguments and arguments. If you happen to go to this clinic, ask who’s in for today before you proceed an examination! Cause apparently, there are better doctors here.
P/S i think her name is Dr. Aiia (or Alla) Rovoza whatever. She has like a thick accent. Avoid her.< /Review>< Pics>

I didn't mind waiting 2.5 hours for care, but to wait that long and have the doctor say "take an ibuprofen and come back next week" is absurd. Not wanting to conduct further tests when I can't hear out of one ear because "it is a time-consuming process and we're closing soon" is absurd.</Review>

< Review>
Their website says they do X-rays. Went here to avoid costly emergency room visit. Turns out they just charge you to tell you what you already know, that you need an X-ray and refer you to someone to get an X-ray. So you get to pay Twice</Review>

< Review>
We had very bad experience in this clinic,  the doctor was so rude, I won’t forget the way she was talking to me so  condescending, we wore left for a very long time waiting for a flu test that the doctor didn’t want to do, but I knew my baby girls was very sick so I ask for the test, doctor didn’t even ask if we wore out of the county,  she just said the symptoms tell me she just need a lot of fluids and give her some Ibuprofen and Tylenol in between to keep fever down, the whole experience was bad, I finally decide to walk out of the office after waiting for the test and I see the nurse out side crying I feel bad for her but I was more worried for my own child that I left to another clinic and yes my daughter had the flu also they ask me to do the test and I had the flu myself and they ask all members that wore traveling to do the flu test and we all became positive.</Review>
