When signing up at Alami Law, they make the procedure extremely easy. I personally am encouraging to go paperless so seeing them begin enforcing electronic signing and PDF saving has been a life saver! I can safely store my contract in my files after without having it loose somewhere! They are making everything and anything accessible for the client!< /review>

My husband had a smoothly experience full of good advices via email with Ulises and Gabriela. They both responded  email fast and answered any of his calls all the time. My husband spoke to Amira before he started his case with her and she responded all questions and doubts so my felt more comfortable. Now he  just became a U.S citizen. We feel so grateful for their help. Very helpful and kind people. Highly recommended.< /text>

I am not one to write reviews often but for this one I am taking my time to write because growing up I was terrified of my sister never being able to have the same privileges and scared we will never be able to make all those trips we planned growing up. Therefore I will like to share my blissful gratitude towards Alami Law and her team who took their time and dedicated themselves in assisting in the process and completion of obtaining my sisters green card, and I am the most content to the able to travel with my sister. I highly recommend Alami Law to anyone seeking immigration help and the truth.< /review>

I am very pleased with my experience at Alami Law. From the moment I walked in for my first consultation, to the moment I decided to leave my case on their hands, the staff was welcoming and respectful. They answered any and all questions that I had and explained the way the process would work in a manner that was easy to understand. If you have any questions or doubts about starting your case, I highly recommend Alami Law. In this current climate, it is truly comforting to know that someone who cares has got your back.</review>

They sent me my contract and the process of signing the contract was so easy and made me feel confident that my immigration case will be a success.
Everyone here is BILINGUAL. If you know someone that only speaks Spanish you’ve come to the right place!

I never write reviews but after Alami successfully handed my case, I knew that I had to bring awareness to their amazing service. My husband and I worked with Amira and her staff throughout a very trying time in our life. They worked long and hard to give us the best results. I would recommend Alami law to everyone dealing with immigration issues. Hands down the best immigration attorney Los Angeles.< /Text>

Alami Law is definitely the best! We consulted 5 other attorneys, they told us we had to go Juarez for our interview. After starting the process with another attorney we were just waiting for our interview in Juarez, however we knew a friend that was using the same attorney as us, and she was left in Juarez because the attorney didn't have her case filled correctly. We decided to call Alami Law went for a consultation and she told us we didn't have to go to Juarez, that it could be done here! We decided to switch attorney and 5 months later our case was successfully done! Thanks to the whole staff! Specially Jackie Wiltron she handled our case and was very helpful and answered all our questions!< /review>

I was in search of an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles that would provide deportation defense for my parents. I was not willing to lose my family and be left alone so I called Alami Law. Not only did they help us with the deportation issue, they also began to help us with the resident process. I don't have words to describe the amount of gratitude I have for Amira. Thank you so much for helping my family stay united. God Bless!</Text>

I recently contacted attorney Amira, was scheduled and appointment promptly and during that appointment we discussed our case, she was thorough, and gave us all possible options in regards to our case.  I felt as if I was talking with someone who really cared and wanted a successful outcome just as we did.  She is very passionate with immigration law, she knows the law, all the changes (which occur often), she is on top of it!  I fully recommend her services.< /review>

I’m sure they have great and knowledgeable attorneys. However, after almost a year of no return calls or any updates whatsoever, we have decided to go somewhere else. We didn’t received a courtesy call to let us know the status of our case, or if it was going to be picked up by any of their lawyers. We made constant calls to the office where no one picked up. We left numerous voicemails with no return calls. We paid $1,500 for some type of background check, and we did not even received a call to let us know the outcome of that. If these attorneys were as attentive with clients as they are to check and reply to review comments in google about their office they would be amazing.</Text>

After everything that I was facing (my family being deported), I knew there was something I had to do to put a stop to it. Luckily, I came across Alami Law's website after researching all the deportation lawyers Los Angeles has to offer and I decided to give their office a call. Not only did I feel so comfortable talking to Amira and her staff on the phone, but being able to visit them face-to-face at their office put everything at ease for me.

<Text>If I could,  I would give the law office zero stars! It’s a scam do not go to this office. They made my cousin case worse with immigration and now she is being deported. The office never had the decency to return any calls or updates. When they showed up to the office they said there was nothing they can do for my cousin. After another lawyer reviewed the paperwork we found out they made my cousin case worse by not responding to the immigration office to appeal. Zero stars.<//Text>< Pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>My mom was fighting her case in court with another lawyer, and we realy weren't happy with the work being done.  Thre was no information being given to us about how to prepare for her hearings.  Nothing about documents that would be needed.  NADA.  We said ENOUGH and knew that we had to find another attorney. That's when we were recommended by a family friend to talk to Amira Al-Alami.  Amira handled my mom's case, took interest in us, made us feel welcome in her office and like we were part of the Alami Law family.  I am not joking when I say that this woman is passionat about what she does.  She does not like to lose, and my mom's case was no exception!  She fought for my mom's rights and always made it her goal to keep our family together and united. Needless to say that we WON in court and my mom gets to stay here legally!  Thank you so much ABOGADA AMIRA! God Bless.< /Review>< Pictures>

I was in desperate search for an immigration attorney in Los Angeles because my brother recently came over from Mexico about 5 months ago. I heard a lot about Amira Law so I decided to go to her for help. My brother needed to get a work permit to be able to sustain himself. Amira is an excelent work permits lawyer in Los Angeles. She managed to help us with the whole process and we were able to recieve the permit in no time. Thank you so much!<//text>

I had the opportunity to meet attorney Amira at a free screening event. I am a hearing doctor. She impressed me with her knowledge. Attorney Amira is very a compassionate person, honest, dedicated, and hard to find. She provided her services for free at this event. Amira worked long hours and displayed a calm and gentle demeanor while she provided with her expertise. I admired her dedication, passion and professionalism. Attorney Amira has the ability to speak perfect Spanish which is a plus in any profession.
I highly recommend her, she provides with excellent services.<//text>

Amira and her staff have been a blessing to every single person I have placed in contact with her, some of which have been my own family. She takes her time in listening to the situation at hand and makes sure her clients leave feeling that they are in the very best hands, because they are. With even the most complicated of cases, she does her due diligence in making them successes. Because of her worth ethic, care, and ultimately her compassion for her clients, I will continue to promote her firm and her services to anyone in need.</review>

I’ve been sending my family and friends to Amira since I’ve known her and I’ve always got back amazing feedback! Her compassion, work ethic, and attention to detail make her such a special person to work with. I’ve seen her handle some really messy situations with such poise and professionalism I am not the least bit surprised in her success. I will continue to support Alami Law and her amazing team, highly recommend her services!

Thanks for all the help Amira!<//review>

Amira Al Alami is the best attorney in LA county I personally have ever met. She not only gave me a thorough consultation explaining my options to fix my status in this country but she was also flexible with my payment plan. Thanks to her I now have legal status in this country and I am able to petition my mother. The process was fast and easy and I will forever be grateful for having such an amazing attorney represent me.

I absolutely recommend her! She will not fail you, promise you that.

To everyone else who was not satisfied with her service, I'm sorry to hear that but I personally think she is completely honest with you and she will tell you straight up if there's something she can do or not. She's not like other attorneys who will steal your money through the long run.< /Review>

<review>I give this so cal lawyer cero stars. She had us going for 2 years i was getting my hopes up as she said she kept working on our case. We kept  on giving her money that she said she needed to help us out. Her helper a male every time we called was very rude and cocky to us. We couldn't ask a question without him putting us down with his rude tone of voice. At the end we had a final visit we thought it was good news but it wasn't .she said because of our situation that was very complicated there was nothing that could be done. I got mad and I said thats it, so why did you get our hopes up. She said sorry but your only hope is to wait till the law changes. She was very wrong she shouldn't have said it. She only takes easy cases not like ours Luckely I didn't listen to her. found a real lawyer. in less than two years he got my waiver approved, my cita at Ciudad Juarez, my visa. We are back in USA with my SSI and my permanent residence card. I wish I could write his name to help more people.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1525295341583, 'text': "Your review is fraudulent, Karina.

Abogada Amira helped my wife with her residency. She was honest with all her answers and the process was fast. My wife is a former Dreamer and also was 245(I). Other attorneys would tell her to get the travel document and come back but would never mention that having 245(I) the Petition could get done here in the US. Thank you Amira, for letting us trust you and for all the hard work you do for our community. My wife did not have to go out and now is an unlawful permanent resident. Very highly recommended.</text>

<review>So I am a first generation college graduate and citizen in this country - I didn't realize the privileges I really had until I started becoming an adult. I have several family members that I've grown up with that live an entirely different reality due to the lack of some of these same privileges I hold. For these same reasons, I've done my best to help connect them to the right resources and people and Amira/Alami Law was one of the best decisions I've made. From our initial conversation to actually sitting and consulting with my family, Alami Law was incredibly professional, understanding, but most importantly compassionate. They approached our situation like we were part of their family and never hesitated to make sure we were satisfied with their services.  Customer service is an art form that I believe has been lost from most establishments - Alami Law re-defined that for us and we couldn't be happier for choosing them to represent us.

Thank you for your time and service Amira, you're blessing to us all and deserve all the success in the world. Keep fighting the good fight!

Cheers,

D.O.< /review>< pics>

They never have answers, months have gone by, and they can't even give us an answer ...

We were told it would cost us $1500 to start the process, but nooooooo, there was more fees , we have paid more than $2000.00 and nothing has been done.
Now a year later, and we have no news, but they are asking for another  $3500.00 ..
I was not willing to pay more so now
and just give me the run around.
I leave message for the attorney, not one call has been returned..

I don't recommend this office.<//text>< Pics>

Where do I begin... Plain and simple, Amira changed my life and my family's life for the better. My cousins were here and undocumented, and on top of that had removal status. Every lawyer we went to had told us there was no relief for them, until we went to see Amira.

She clearly explained the opportunity at hand and gave us hope. Not only did she give us hope, she turned that hope into a reality! The whole process was extremely painless, everything was very smooth working with Amira and her staff, we were never once uneasy or felt unsure of what was going to happen.

The whole process was painless and Amira instilled great confidence in our case. In the end my cousins were given relief and words cannot explain how grateful my family and I are to Amira and her work!</text>

<text>Unfortunate these people were no help. All they did was take my money and push me to the side. They never gave me any updates about my case and the only time I would get a call from them was when when I had to give another payment. I actually thought they were going to help me out but unfortunately all they did was steal my money.< /text>< response>

(Translated by Google) I was battling for a long time with another immigration lawyer, I spoke to Amira's lawyer's office and the person who attended me was very friendly and efficient, after reviewing my case they realized some discrepancies that there were and immediately began to work on it. Thank you very much to all who work in this office as they made it possible for me to fix my immigration status and obtain my residency. To all those interested in obtaining legal documents in this country, I recommend the office of the lawyer Amira Al Alami.

(Translated by Google) I heard the lawyer, Amira, speak at the show about the good, the bad and the ugly, and decided to contact her office to see if they took my partner's case, but they only collected money to say that they could not take the marriage due to lack of personnel and lack of time. , but they did not say that before collecting the money, I really thought that if they were going to help us, but that was not our case, we lost money for just one answer.

<Text>I asked the baker to make a cake for my father-in-law’s 99th birthday dinner. We couldn’t have the big party he deserved due to CoVid restrictions, so I wanted something really special. They sure delivered!  He’d never dreamed such a cake was possible, and since it was his favorite cake (chocolate) and his favorite ice cream (butter pecan), it was PERFECT!!  They made a photo cake with a dynamite picture of him. Thanks guys.

It's Baskin-Robbins great ice cream as usual.  We always get good service and a smile.  My only complaint is that I want my all time favorite flavor, Love Potion 31, all year, not just in February.< /Review>

baskin-robbins is always a great place to get ice cream. They have so many flavors, so many combinations, not to mention shakes and smoothies and all other types of things. If you want anything cold and yummy, and this is a place to go. Last night I got the pralines and cream and the Snickers ice cream. Man, they were really good! Definitely recommended<//Text>

i ordered a mint chocolate chip shake. To my disbelief there was a hair in my shake. It was pressed up on the side of the cup to be seen clear as day. I was so disgusted by this I lost the want for anything and left empty handed while my family of 4 enjoyed there treats. This is why we always go to rite-aid for ice cream.... Yuck!<//Review>

Great store. I went during Black Friday & it was well taken care of, but a line did form upon paying & one of the staff was just standing there looking at us but aside from that it was great.<//review>

I came here looking for some really cool shades but surprisingly the Manager was terribly rude. He was apparently on the phone and wouldn't answer questions I had for him. Things escalated quickly... I asked for his name and he said to call customer service and they'll take care of it. Jose the Manager has terrible people skills. I will never ever buy Oakley's here again.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) This establishment has a very good location, ample parking and very easy access.
I have to point out that they have a great variety of articles of very good quality and very beautiful.
The truth is that this store is low cost but it is understandable for the products they handle.
Staff attention is good.
And they have everything very well organized.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>3<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Good selection but prices are still high despite being an outlet. The lenses are worth it but they are not very cheap. They can take you used ones in exchange for a 25% discount on new ones that don't have any promotion. There is hardly any replacement for all the original lenses.

(Original)
Buena selección pero los precios siguen estando altos a pesar de ser outlet. Si valen la pena los lentes pero no son muy económicos. Te pueden tomar unos usados a cambio de un 25% de descuento en unos nuevos que ni tengan promoción. Casi no hay repuesto de todos los lentes originales.< /Text>< Date>

Manager/Owner really cares about the customers and the food. My pork bahn mì was delicious, and perfect before my flight (or to bring on a flight). Pork was seasoned and tender, veggies were fresh, baguette was toasty! Some of the flavors/spice are tamed down, but that's okay by me.< /text>

< Review>
- food is alright but..-

I waited the cashier to notice me, but she focused on counting the bills in the register. Then later she saw me, but she signaled me to wait like counting money is the priority, not customers *smh*. Then another cashier came to get my order at the register, but she failed to inform me about the credit card sur charge like it is difficult to say something about it ...

The grilled pork sandwich was alright, nothing special but not bad either. However, I spent 1 min to get my order done and 6 minutes to get my sandwich, which is super slow for vietnamese sandwich since all u gotta do is put stuff in the bun anyways.. i think they do not expect their customers to return, and perhaps all of their customers are first timers like me who happened to want some viet food at the airport but got annoyed by the customer service. Btw the sandwich is expensive, $12.. i can get a gigantic sandwich from subway -.-</Review>

< Review>
$8 for a kids meal, is a great deal at an airport! Just chicken and noodles but it’s not like kids really like anything green. Same size bowl as adult. Also had dumpling soup and tofu bun. Both were good. Not made from scratch at all, but it tastes decent. Yes pricy but it’s the airport.< /Review>

When I walked in and order my chicken sandwich. There was a lady cleaning a floor and food trays, of course she had gloves on.
Suddenly she stopped cleaning and started to make my chicken sandwich with the filthy gloves.
When I pointed out that I’m highly uncomfortable with her using same gloves for cleaning as for cooking. She said something in her language and ignored me. Manager issued me a refund. I do not recommend this place only in case if somebody wants to get poisoned.</Review>

<Review>I'm Vietnamese and have tried pho in the US and Vietnam. This is by far the most mediocre attempt at making pho ($16) by non-vietnamese cooks. I think they're Thai/Cambodian. The broth lacked depth and flavor. It just tastes like boiled water. The thinly sliced beef were all clumped together to form a thick slice of beef. The only saving grace were the noodles--which to be fair isn't hard to screw up.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgQ-By9rNCBDj_ueCTHHrOa_QbLR8RV6uEiGML=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808f779acdcfb7eb:0x2e294d363baea6e3< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

$14.50 for a small bowl of pho? I know... airport prices. However,  the broth has to be hot enough to cook the raw beef. Their broth is not hot enough!  The beef was raw. Not rare, but raw. The health department should be notified.</review>

Would have been a three - it's airport food after all.  Dropped them to two stars because of a hidden surcharge that doesn't show up on the menu.   Just build it into the cost; hiding it as a surcharge is just deceptive and taking advantage of flyers.</Text>

Abysmal. I have pretty low standard for pho, but what I got from Mumfresh can not be classified as Pho. To start off, the portion is about a third of a standard bowl of pho, and the price is almost double that. As to be somewhat expected at an airport, if this was the only problem, this review would be much higher.

Their "beef broth" I'm pretty sure is the hot water they pour into the bowl to cook the rare steak, and therefore has a slight tinge of flavor. I never thought anything with cilantro, onions, shallots, and scallions could possible be tasteless, yet it is almost as if they did not season their food in the slightest way. The highlight of the meal, was when I ate a single slice of raw onion by itself. Their condiments come in small packets located behind the counter, rather than the multiple bottles they have on their shelves. Apparently used purely for appearances. I would advise asking for a lot of condiments, you'll need it to actually taste anything.

Service itself was pretty mediocre, took a while to get serviced, and even longer for them to call out my food was ready. Between the time they finished my food, and called out my number, the "rare steak" had already gone well done.

Overall, this experience was one that left my mouth with a bad taste of no taste at all, and a small hole in my wallet. Highly recommend people to avoid this place, I'm still hungry.</Review>

(Translated by Google) If you like Vietnamese cuisine and settle for lower standards than you would expect from a restaurant (MumFresh is closer to an ethnic fast food), this is definitely a good solution.
I must say that I found the other reviews, many of them negative, inconsistent with my experience or very severe with respect to the type of venue.

<review>(Translated by Google) This fresh mother Mumfresh's Vietnamese powder shop is not flattering.
The beef powder I want, the meal is not hot at the bottom, the beef is not cooked, and the soup is not sweet enough.
I used to have five bags of chili sauce to send the powder.
The location is near the 95th door of the SFO T3.
The price is not cheap, 14$ before tax.
I should not come again next time.

这家新鲜妈妈Mumfresh的越南粉店着实不敢恭维。
我要的牛肉粉，粉砣在底部没有烫开，牛肉有些许没有烫熟，入口汤头也不够鲜甜。
我愣是配了五袋辣椒酱才把粉送下去。
位置就在SFO T3靠近95门处。
价格也不便宜，税前14$。
下次应该不会再来。< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVW-nH0dMtT7CN4gPlnxjdxnwZ2HgzLQpeO3Dw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuXjdwuPh5MsT6kvHP-HBLOZGfTDtnYzrnrSz6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><user>104847722561117485757<//user></record>

(Translated by Google) If you're hungry, it might be just the right volume, but it's too high! At this price, I don't think this volume is a science fiction that costs a lot to eat out.

(Original)
小腹がすいた、と言う場合には丁度よいボリュームかも知れませんが、余りにも高い！このお値段でこのボリュームはいくら外食費が高いSFだって無いだろう～、と思います。<//Text>

Last Monday afternoon, I went to this pet shop to buy some stuff for my lovely dog. I was so happy when you have it at a very friendly price. I also thanked your staves for being so friendly to me. What a nice service! I am always thankful to you guys for being so helpful. Highly recommendable pet shop in the area!<//review>

<text>I’m going to start by saying that they have nice and attentive/helpful front desk staff. Today was my first time coming to this location and I only came because I was looking for a place that had grooming same day appointments, thankfully they had an availability which I’m glad they did because I might be driving to this location now as opposed to the DTLA location. I appreciate the attention given to Zen and noticing his behavior while being under their care. Very rarely do I hear from the groomer small details that go a long way, so to the young man who groomed Zen thank you very much! To the front staff working today in the afternoon thank you both for being yourselves and providing good customer service.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1617987498608, 'text': 'Hi, Laura!

You are the best pet shop that I've known! A week ago, I bought some stuff for my dogs. I was so amazed when you just offered those stuff at a very affordable price. I really appreciated your services, the staves were so friendly and professional. Keep it up. guys! Thank you! I should strongly recommend you to everyone!<//Text>

I came here to see what the store was like and to get some new car N dog toys and some dog food. The store is open and we'll lit and very clean - it is newly remodeled after the auto place closed. The staff here were all very friendly and helpful.  I'm thinking about taking one of the dogs here to be groomed.<//Text>

I was completely happy and pleased with this shop! The place was clean, comfortable, and modern. Also, the staff were all very friendly, nice, and accommodating. They had helped me introduce to the different pets they have in their shop. All of it was well-arranged and beautiful to look at. I truly enjoyed visiting this place because I felt happy and comfortable. Thanks!<//review>

I bought 2 bags of cat food, no return was involved, her words were “well you can take a picture of the iPad but I’m not going to email it and It won’t print” a receipt was shown to me on the iPad and she had to do was press the button that said “send by email”. What i said was “what if I need to return this” and that was it, I don’t need to reach out your team you have to teach your employees not to be rude and to respect the law by giving customers their receipt</Review>< rate>

We certainly never intend to leave that type of impression.  In looking into this a little further, it appears that the transaction involved an item return.  She could not reprint the receipt because the original purchase was made prior to our switching over our system.  We're so sorry but we cannot access and reprint receipts from transactions on the old system and we apologize that is was not communicated clearly.  If you are amenable, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you further.  Please email us at social@healthyspot.com with your contact information so that we an set up a time for you to connect with our Area Manager."}</Response><Name>Maximiliano Ceni< /Name>< user>

<review>I was first drawn because of the 4 star ratings but still skeptical of the really bad reviews. I gave it a shot and have no regrets. I was very specific about what we wanted and she followed them all!!! Our little monkey was clean, smelling good and trimmed very nicely. Loved how they pay attention and trimmed around her feet! Facility is just ok but I guess the groomer is more important!<//review>< pics>

I recently moved to the area and decided to give healthy spot a try because my pup desperately needed a haircut and nail clip. I have a rescue and he is terrified of groomers. To my surprise he was absolutely calm when I came to pick him up. It has never happened before. Normally he tries to run away. The groomer was very nice (don't remember her name 😕) and we definitely will come back. The store staff is also very nice and friendly< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>This review is for the store itself and not the grooming because we have not done that... yet. The people who work at the Healthy Spot on Seward and Melrose treat every customer and dog who trots in there like royalty. (Yes, my dog Kai trots in there... LOL)

The first time I was there was on a whim, yet we went home with treasure bag full of treats and promotional packages of organic food to sample. But also my many, many questions about grooming were patiently answered. We just returned from our 3rd visit- with another very positive experience. (And Kai picked out a teddy bear! <3 <3 <3 )

True, there's some high end stuff there that is way overpriced. But there are great affordable selections, too! They're so friendly and helpful, they'll help you find whatever you need within in your budget. The customers are also friendly! It's like a very civilized dog park, but in a clean store! I love taking Kai to The Healthy spot.

So if you have a doggie (or kitty) to shop for this holiday, I highly reccomend you check them out. :)</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Absolutely the best staff I've ever dealt with cannot say enough about how amazing you feel after leaving this store whether you bought something or not, due to just chatting about your pet, promotional things like Halloween competitions. Just a great place you know this store was built with a heart</text>

We brought our Maltese-mix to The Healthy Spot on Melrose for a first time grooming. The location is super clean with easy parking.  Our dog has fine, silky hair and he was a mess! Annie did such a great job with him and we couldn't be happier. :-) We gave her some basic instructions on how we wanted him cut and it's perfect! We also had super helpful customer service at check-out from Billy (and others, but I forgot to get her name) with great advice about food and treats. Can't wait to go back!<//Text>

Great customer service. Very knowledgeable and non pretentious staff with a rather wide selection of healthy foods and treats for your canine and feline friends. I no longer need to go to Petco (which I never really liked anyway.) The prices are not outlandish. They may be a dollar or three more than the big box stores, but I'd rather have my pets on a reliable, healthy diet, with experts in my neighborhood that I can talk to. Great Place!<//text>

I live close to this park and wish it was a good place. Lots a unattended kids are there breaking stuff and making it a mess. When the park is empty its a nice place but that is rare. Be carful with the young ones its common to find beer bottles on the playgrounds<//Text>

Dark roast coffee is really good. Not too many places around here to grab a quick coffee. This place is a gem.< /Review>

Mono Cup is the best stop along 395 for good coffee, they simply know how to do Coffee, Espresso drinks and the other drinks you'd expect at a dedicated coffee house...perfectly. they also offer light pastry and snack fare, breakfast sandwiches and bottled drinks for sale.  The prices are great, and considering the coffee, the value is off the charts. My wife thinks they have the best white chocolate mocha she's ever had, I love their house medium roast, and have also had their coldbrew (best I've ever had)...the service is excellent...the line was out the door the other day and reinforcments arrived quickly...always a smile and friendly goodbye. ..they truly care about doing it right and making you happy!

Update: summer 2018....it is as great as ever...if you are looking for coffee near Lee Vining...it's at Mono Cup!</Review>

Awesome coffee shop. Purchased a Chai tea latte, a caramel frap and a vanilla bean frap with some pastries and they were all good. Prices here are reasonable. You'll get a 10 percent discount if your staying next door at Murphys Motel<//review>

The guy working there was super nice. He made the drink to my tastes. I ordered a coconut iced coffee and I left super happy with it. The prices are kind of high, but you have to keep in mind theyre in the middle of nowhere. You also get what you pay for. I would recommend you grab your coffee here!</Text>

I am a Starbucks snob!   Since Lee Vining doesn't have one, I gave Mono Cup Coffee a try.  Outstanding rival coffee!!  My Caramel Macchiato was so good I returned another day.  Friendly service and great coffee!  Stop by when in town.</Review>

Don’t even bother calling to order, the lady was so rude ! And had me and my husband wait for her to take our order for about 10 minutes while we heard her have full on conversations with other customers that walked in the store. We called again thinking she forgot about us and she picked up and hung up! This would’ve been our first time eating from here but with that kind of service ? Nope! What a way to give customer service.<//Text>

They have a "C". I can't believe I used to eat here! I looked up their score and they have a 78% with 12 violations 2 of them being major violations for not following proper hand washing protocol and not wearing gloves or hairnets/proper hair restraints. The second major violation was for not getting their food from a authorized or legit source. I won't be going back there... Ever!!!< /review>

<text>The pupusas and burritos mojado are extremely delicious. Staff are friendly, but they'll sometimes get a to go order wrong. Make sure you have what you want before you leave. Other than that, it's awesome.<//text><Response>{'time': 1495569022075, 'text': 'Thanks for the visit, and the suggestion Eben C.'}<//Response>< name>

<text>Excellent pupusas, which were also very inexpensive.  The loroco pupusa was too heavily cheesy for my taste, but otherwise a great value, and though the interior is old it is clean.< /text>< pictures>

They give fuel to all my vehicle machine issues. They likewise give lube oil to my vehicle and natural administrations. They are incredible in client care, and we have an extraordinary relationship with them! The best service station ever!< /Review>

<text>This place is constantly out of diesel and particular tenders are very picky about the type of dollars they receive. We own a business and at the end of the night we have lots of dollar bills which we use to purchase diesel but they refuse to take the bills because they have too much change and turn customers away.

<user_name>CHRISTINA COLEMAN< /user_name>< review>
The RVs are pretty dated, absolutely nothing fancy, including no GPS and no bluetooth stereo.  The black water sensor never worked, and the LP detector malfunctioned and started beeping on our first night, requiring that we take the RV to a repair shop to have it disconnected, and we had to buy a plug in one to use in the meantime.  Later, the check engine light went on for no apparent reason.  But the customer service was phenomenal.  When we had issues with the above, we called the 800 number and get help right away.  Cruise America paid for the repair directly and reimbursed us for one day's rental fee for our inconvenience, in addition to reimbursing us for the plug-in.  The RV worked well the rest of the trip, which was just over 1800 miles, and our family of 4 fared well in the small but very functional space.  We would use them again.<//review>

<rate>4</rate><text>My 3rd time renting from Cruise America. Each time the RV has worked great and the check-in/out experience was good. The first 2 rentals were from the LAX/Carson facility.

This time we rented from the Downey location and although the door sign read masks required, none of the staff had masks on. I was a bit disappointed in their lack of adherence to the guidelines.

We got to our campsite the first night and the next morning I noticed the rear passenger tire looked low - bought a gauge and the tire was definitely low ~20psi. I put some air in it and watched it for the next 3 days - seemed like a slow leak. I decided to have it fixed while we were staying in one location for a couple days. Turns out there was a screw in the tire.  Given the slow leak, I’m pretty sure it was in the tire when we picked it up and the folks in the Downey office hadn’t checked the tire pressure.

I did submit the expense and there was no question about refunding me the amount. I think we were lucky we did t get a flat on the road with the pressure so low.

The other disappointing part of the check-out was that the staff didn’t run through the vehicle with me. They asked if I had rented before and when the answer was yes, they assumed that I knew everything about how to operate the RV - which was true, but then I was left to check all of the items such as making sure the generator worked, the stove would light, etc.

Overall, the experience with Cruise America was good and I’ll definitely rent from them again.</text>< pics>

Rented 25'RV from Cruise America in Downey, Ca.
Picked up on Thursday afternoon and returned on Monday, 9:am
Easy pickup procedure, took less then half hour, and dropped off Monday with no issues. Will rent again from Cruise America, because of service and also pricing is much lower then competitors.</text>

<review>Great experience. Got a confirmation call day before scheduled pickup. Only bad comment is we waited about 2 hours for our RV before it was ready. They were still washing it when we got there. But it was clean inside with a full tank of gas. No issues with RV during our trip. Drop off was easy. Friendly service at location. Will be a returning customer.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service at this location. Very helpful and answered all my questions. When I returned it there was no hassle or problems. They listened and worded with me and made my first experience with a RV a great experience. I will definitely rent from them again.</text>

Service was efficient enough. Cabinet latch needed repair. Sink could’ve been cleaned out. RV was very loud and stove banged when we hit a little bump. RV ran great but with 95K miles the suspension could use an upgrade.</text>

My son Paul Denino and his friend Sam Pepper decided to rent a rv thru cruise americas rv rental service. 2 days into the trip Paul got charged $ 10,000 $ for absolutely no reason! When Paul asked what for they just said "in  case of damages". There was hardly any damages it was just the table was broken, and the fire extinguisher was broken! Paul only got refunded $ 6,000 back! What a joke of a company.< /review>

Easy pickup procedure, took less then half hour, and dropped off Monday with no issues. Will rent again from Cruise America, because of service and also pricing is much lower then competitors.</Text><resp>None<//resp><username>Lonnie Barnes<//username>< rating>

Great experience. Got a confirmation call day before scheduled pickup. Only bad comment is we waited about 2 hours for our RV before it was ready. They were still washing it when we got there. But it was clean inside with a full tank of gas. No issues with RV during our trip. Drop off was easy. Friendly service at location. Will be a returning customer.< /text>

My son Paul Denino and his friend Sam Pepper decided to rent a rv thru cruise americas rv rental service. 2 days into the trip Paul got charged $ 10,000 $ for absolutely no reason! When Paul asked what for they just said "in  case of damages". There was hardly any damages it was just the table was broken, and the fire extinguisher was broken! Paul only got refunded $ 6,000 back! What a joke of a company.< /Text>

They have so many choices to add to your bowl, and it’s always fun watching them cook it on the open grill. Don’t be afraid to pile on the noodles, vegetables, and sauces. Hulas is excellent for leftovers. Your meal includes rice, soup, and wontons. You can eat there or take it to go.</Review>< pictures>

<user>105850033918253011502< /user><review>Interesting place. Only Mongolian style restaurant I've been to that encourages people to squish everything in 1 bowl, so you can have take away (left overs). Literally people take a second bowl and compact their items. This makes the buffet line take 2x as long as it should.  Otherwise clean restaurant with helpful staff. The cooks make a point of making eye contact with you.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>4<//Rate><username>SuperRyanML< /username></record></dataset><record>

This is the best Mongolian grill type of restaurant I’ve ever been to! You pick all of your ingredients and then they cook it in front of you. I got mine to go and was very pleased with the amount of food for the price! For around $13 I got a big bowl of my custom stir fry, hot and sour pork soup (which was delicious), rice, and wontons with sweet and sour dipping sauce. Usually when I go to these types of grills my food loses a lot of the sauce and I’m left wishing I had more, not the case!!! My noodles were not dry and had amazing flavor. I was also surprised that they had lamb as a meat option! I would like to see some seafood on the line, but I was still very impressed. The atmosphere was nice and clean. Every employee was kind and personal, even the cooks. AWESOME JOB HULA!< /text>

Chico's famous Mongolian BBQ. You select from tons of fresh meats, fresh veggies, tofu, noodles and sauces and at the end of the line it's stir fried on a huge grill while you watch. Steamed rice, egg roll, crisp wonton and great daily soup come with lunch and dinner. Amazing food, nice atmosphere and always good service. Beer, wine, soft drinks and teas make this a perfect meal. Good for large groups. Prices are reasonable.<//Review>

Good Mongolian food. The restaurant name says Chinese restaurant, but it is not Chinese food by any means. They employ a great business strategy but displaying a variety of food to choose from, but once you pick up the bowl with comparatively smaller size to fit it all, it won't fit everything that they have there. It's funny but overall everything is good.< /review>

Used to love this place but now long lines and lax manager makes it bad experience.  Look at this nasty floor.</review>

Been going here for years. Always a crowd pleaser. You can tell who is a regular by how tall the bowl gets. I do wish this location had the trays as you are building your bowl so when something falls off it’s not gone forever. Word of advice, you can never put in too much sauce. Thank you Hulas for being consistently amazing for the 10 years my husband and I have been coming here.<//Text>

Very adequate Mongolian BBQ, but nowhere near the best I've been to. I don't get the people raving about it being the best. If you are just a casual Mongolian BBQ customer, you may well love it. However, for the more discerning Mongolian BBQ fan, there are much better places. Maybe not in Chico, so perhaps it's the best in the immediate vicinity. The sauces and oils could be better with more traditional options added. Good selection of meats. Staff was friendly, and the cooks worked hard, kept the grill moving, and cleaned it when it had been used a lot. Would I eat there again? Sure, if I were in the area. Would I write home about it? Not really. Not bad at all, but far from the hype I read and heard about.<//text>

<Text>Really disappointed spent $92.00 for my wife my 6 kids and I. Honestly way too over priced especially since my kids range are 1 3 4 6 9 and 10. And the food wasnt that great. No kids special. At lunch us adults got charged dinner prices at 2 in the afternoon. 3 years ago was an awsom 10 star to me. Today I'd rather go to home town buffet. At least the vegies would be cooked all the way</Text>< user>

Cannot prepare vegetarian food. When asked to clean grill they do however they quickly throw food off grill spilling most onto the disposal and the food is always under cooked. When brought to attention of a manager. Management was rude. Wishing I could rate zero stars.< /review>

<Text>I ate dinner here with my girlfriend for our Friday date night before heading to the movies. Definitely worth the price for all you can eat. The build your own bowl as high as you can thing is nice but knowing the secrets to getting a Mt. Everest size bowl is something that comes after a few visits. Plus on the round grill in front you is cool to see. The staff are friendly. The table service can be a little lengthy as well as the line to get food due to the high volume of people there depending on your arrival time. I suggest 30 minutes to a hour after normal lunch times and 1 hour before they close is always nice. I know it's a buffet but the area where you load your bowl can be pretty messy. Which makes you think who touched this last. Anyways who cares the food is bomb and you can take home your left overs. So I'll be going there tomorrow for cousins B-day. She loves their food.< /Text>< pictures>

I think they need work on the consistency of the sweet & sour sauce for once it cools down. The cleanliness of the napkins and forks could also use a little upkeep. But other than that, this place is fresh, yummy, comfy, and always busy. So you KNOW it's good lol.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Great food! Definitely pricey, but very good. I love how you pick everything in your bowl, and then watch it be grilled. My recommendation to anyone who is going for the first time is to pile on the meat, then grab a second bowl and use that to compress all of that down as much as you can. Then just pile your bowl as big as you can because everything shrinks quite a bit as it's grilled. I also recommend adding a lot of sauce (at least 7-8 ladels) it just helps everything taste better.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Great selection of vegetables! The sauces seemed a bit diluted though. Also, they didn't serve us soup and rice automatically. When we asked about it, the server said she usually.omly we've them if asked. Weird.</text>< user_id>

My favorite place to eat in Chico.  The food here is high quality (they just added a couple more options too), prepared right in front of you by great cooks, and the staff is friendly.  They’re accommodating and environmentally sensitive.  Big thumbs up!<//Review>

My soup was supposed to be pork but there was only mushrooms in it no pork and my rice also had some black thing in it. But the rest of the food was good.

Fantastic food, fair price.

Hula's has two locations in the Chico area, though there's little to distinguish the two aside from the 20th street location being slightly larger. Both locations are home to the best (and until recently, only) Mongolian barbecue in Butte county .

Now, Chico is a college town, so one must come prepared for the possibility of encountering some liberally-minded college snowflakes; at times this place can be utterly packed, meaning standing in a line of up to an hour on some occasions, but I can't hold the establishment's clientele or popularity against them.

All in all, it's worth the price and worth the patience. Fill your first bowl to the brim, eat what you can, and take the rest home!<//text>

<Review>Great Mongolian BBQ in Chico.  Lots of choices for additions and the staff is always most friendly.  The line can get a little long at times but that is the nature of fresh Mongolian BBQ.  Great place for kids as the staff is really friendly and helpful.  They also have car seat cradles and high chairs for the kiddos, those car seat cradles are life savers for sleeping infants.< /Review>< time>

I don't care for the food here at all.This place is very over rated.  It is always insanely busy and I am not sure why when the food is not that great.  The wait times can be insane at times and the food is not worth it to be honest.</review>

Ive been a patron for over 17 years. Consistent and quality food. Not the cheapest, but if you ever leave hungry your doing it very wrong. The staff keeps the buffet line very clean, even in the lunch or dinner rush. The selection of BBQ items is great, and always very fresh.</Text>

While the service is always friendly, I do not get the hype. The food is really just okay and it's dry no matter how much sauce you add to it. I think you're better off making stir fry at home honestly.<//text>

My family and I "waited to be seated," as instructed by the sign, for 10 minutes and not 1 single employee so much as acknowledged us. The "cooks" left a lot to be desired as they circled the fryer and mixed my food with 2 other patrons! I'll definitely be sticking to the one by Toys R Us<//Review>< Pictures>

I'm a big fan of Mongolian BBQ, I love the choices and the variety. Hula's does a great job providing fresh ingredients and keeping the food area clean. The cooks should clean the grill a bit more frequently, but that's my only complaint.</text>

SUPER Disappointed!!!!! It took me 45 min in total to get to Hula's and back home due to traffic, but I love this place so I said it's worth it! Got home and I had someone else's BOWL. Called them right away in hopes they had not thrown by bowl away to my luck they did but the nerve of the employee who answered the phone who did not care about the mistake they made was just was like just come back and make yourself a new one this happens often....So the inconvenience they have cost the customer is like whatever it happens your time is worthless to us..mmm ok so I expressed how upset I was and she had the nerve to tell me what do you want me to do give you a free meal...NO just a simple sorry with a caring tone of voice would have been fine! after 11 years of being a loyal customer I'm just left with no words.. Hula's please retrain your employees! Customer service should have been your #1 priority especially if your employees made the mistake< /text>

<review>Love Hula's! Only complaint is that lately there has been lots of leftover charcoal on the grill, which ends up in my food!!! :< The servers grab your food so fast you can't even ask for them to clean the grill!! Really frustrating as a vegetarian, I really am unsettled by the amount of leftover meat I have found in my dishes sometimes.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<rate>1</rate><review>Today my mother and I decided to try Hulas.  We had been by the restaurant many times and decided to give it a try.  We grabbed an empty bowl and started loading different foods into it.  I picked chicken and various vegetables.  It was quite a long wait in line to get your food cooked on the large wok.  We sat down to eat our meal when at the table next to us a 2-year old starting screaming and crying.  Her mother was in line to get her food.  There were other adults at the table who gave her some rice to eat, but the child kept screaming and crying.  We quickly finished our meal and Mom came back to attend to the child.  Mom sits down and whips out her breast and starts feeding the child.  She did not cover herself up, it was obvious she wanted every one to see her breast feeding her child in the restaurant.  I spoke to the cashier about it and the cashier made me out to be the bad person.  I'll never eat at Hula's ever again and I will tell my friends not to eat there as well.  There's no more respect for other people, they don't care about you and your wanting to enjoy the food and environment.  This woman had no proper upbringing.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x8082d886635cf5b9:0x3b64a6f4d43a8cbf< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>This is 2nd time eating here, travel 45 minutes.
Food prepare Mongolian style, but only 1 bowl vegetables and meat constitutes  eat and take home the rest.
If you have a palate for good vegetables and meat cooked seperate this is considered 2 dishes of an eat all you like but No-take-out remainder.
The Owners Policy needs reviewing or they will loose customers.
Astute businesses and people like us who travel 45 minutes to an hour to eat - will find other restaurants to support.
There is also no Nutritional Chart for health conscious folks to select from.
Frozen beef, chicken, pork, and lamb make up meats and selection of fresh vegetables, but no fruit.
Rating is Poor 1 Star for Policy, and service</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Very busy on a Sunday afternoon but service was very slow and over all service was not clean. Food was fresh but counters very dirty and not cleaned. Cooks were not focused and cooking surface was filthy. Food taste was ok. 3 star for food quality, would only give 1 star for speed of service and cleanliness.<//Review>

Good was great...unfortunately our waitress was one of the worst we've ever had. She was obviously on her own agenda and we were an inconvenience for her to have to wait on. Just because of her we will not be returning. Very disappointed with the service.</review>

This food is always fantastic! Always kept clean, never runs out of product, and on top of serving the tables. The wide variety of ingredients never leaves me wanting and the Hula's famous teriyaki sauce is awesome.</Review>

Lots of options of veggies and sauces. Then we saw peanuts.. We hesitated to eat since we have severe peanut allergies.  When we told management they gladly cleaned and scraped the grill clean.  We will definitely be eat here again when in town.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Delicious.  You kind of make your own food here, by chosing the ingredients in your meal so if you don't like it it's your own fault.  That said, best advice for first-time visitors:  whatever sauces you use, use loads and loads of it and always use more than one sauce.  Also, most people will not like it their first time because not being familiar with the place you're lilely to choose ingrediants that end up as something that, although not bad, isnxt really that special.  So, my recommendation is to go at least twice.  The second time, you'll be more familiar with the place and will likely end up with a much better meal as a result...  Judge this place by your second visit, not your firat.<//Text>< pictures>

Overpriced mediocre food. Place is clean and the staff is friendly, but overall not worth the money.< /text>

Love the fact that you get to pick your own ingredients. Sadly it all ends up tasting kind of the same at the end; I never seem to finish what I order.<//Text>

Very tasty if you know what you are doing and so dose the cook, make sure they get it cooked all the way and you add a good amount of sauce!  Pretty clean but a little exspensive as well.< /review>

I actually took it home to see if I could add something to moisten it.</review>

Great service and good food (if it tastes bad generally it's because you made a bad sauce combo). I appreciate that they always stop and clean the grill when I ask. As someone who doesn't eat pork or sea food, it makes my experience so much better.< /Text>
