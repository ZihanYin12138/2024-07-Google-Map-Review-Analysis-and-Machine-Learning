The food tastes homemade, tried the sopa de pata was a bit salty, but overall good flavor. The plantains were sweet and cooked very well. The pupusas were good too.</Review>

Best chicken tamales around! The foods great and staff is friendly. I recommend calling ahead only because the parking there is very limited and its easier to just run in and pick up your food.<//text>

This was my first time ordering here.. I ordered pupusas and a breakfast plate and let me tell you that,  I have never had such a horrible food.. this food is not Salvadorian at all.. The pupusas taste horrible the cheese in it was not even melted.. the pan dulce was super old and hard, that I couldn't even bite on it. I felt that I just wasted my money at this place..I will never come back or order from this place again.</Review>

I ordered food and was told to wait an estimated 20 minutes. 30 minutes after, I arrived. I was totally ignored while the employees spread rumors and played music on the back area. I waited and shortly after another customer arrived. They attended her right away, therefore she is a regular, I was noticed, but ignored. I eventually left, and had a random number contact me via text. One of the employees apparently texted me, threating me to not come back, like if I even wanted to. On a call she told my girlfriend it was all my fault, obviously not wanting to own up to her mistake. She told her a different story which I find comic because not once did we exchange any words. Yet she was rapid to blame me and even though
she ignored me, knew exactly who I was.I'm not here to talk down on anyone, but please improve your service and learn to take responsibility. Also, mis raices is down a few blocks. Their food is better and cheaper, and they actually pay attention to the customers.  Just saying.< /Review>

It's decent haven't tried the pupusas yet, the tamales de elote are good but expensive. Each one is $2.50 so if you got that cash go for it.</Review>

<review>One of the tastiest pupusas I’ve had in years. They have friendly service. The cashier was nice. I got my pupusas in less than 20 minutes, and the short wait was worth every minute. I came here for the first time because I wanted to try their Tuesday/Thursday $1 pupusas (revueltas or with bean only). I am definitely coming back sometime soon.<//review>< Resp>

This is probably a pretty good place. I've driven past here many times. Stopped for el Pollo loco,big mamas and papas pizza, and the Chinese place next door on Roscoe. Unfortunately, I don't speaka Spanish. Even though I was first in line, in an empty establishment, they told me it would be 45 minutes for my 2 pupusas as I watched 10 other people get their large orders(not pickup) before me. Very disappointing.
First time, last time. Bye.(Adios!)< /Review>

First they have that they open at 6am sunday looked through pictures it said 7am went at 7:45am they open until 8am. The atol de elote is bland no flavor whatsoever. They charge $2 for a tamal de pollo which is 1.75 for pure masa and .75cents for uncook potato huge piece of bell pepper and a tiny piece of chicken. The tamale is also so dry and felt old. Then the pan frances is so old the inside cracks when it is cut. I spent $32 for 12 tamales that i wont even eat 9 breads that the birds wont even eat and an atol that i drank only less than half. Its expensive for low quality food dont go there they do not have a salvadorean cooking their food if its this bad.<//text>

The first photo is of a roast chicken and look how they gave it with the mustard still not well cooked. And the second photo was a plate of fried chicken that the chicken was very dry and very hard. They had already cooked it before and they fried it again to sell it. As one cannot see the food there in the restaurant it is only to take away if they give the food to one. What a sadness and this restaurant the owners are Christians the cook is Christian too. We ordered 2 chicken tamales and they didn't come in the bag. How dishonest these people are.

Este restaurante no sirve. La primera foto es de un pollo asado y miren como lo dieron con la mostasa todavia no bien cocinado. Y la segunda foto fue un plato de pollo frito que el pollo estaba bien reseco y bien duro. Ya lo abian cocinado antes y lo volvieron a freir otra vez para venderlo. Como uno no puede ver la comida ahi en el restaurante solo es para llevar a si le dan la comida a uno. Que tristeza y este restaurante los dueños son cristianos la cocinera es cristiana tambien. Ordenamos 2 tamales de pollo y no venian en la bolsa. Que falta de honresa de esta gente.<//Text>< rate>

The solution is to order your order by phone and so when you get to the restaurant your food is on your table in a couple of minutes.

La comida en general es muy sabrosa,  pero a veces tardan demasiado en servir la orden lo que puede ser un gran problema si tu tiempo es limitado por cuestion de que tienes que regresar al trabajo.

(Translated by Google) One of the worst places to eat. Customer service is the worst. They will treat you like they do you a favor and you weren't paying.

This place is the worst in dealing with the Client.

<text>Great staff and great service. Steve's
Is one of the best little gas stations in the area. Very clean. Virtually spotless. And with propane and a dumping station it's a great way to prepare for a nice long socially distant road trip.<//text>< gmap_id>

Very easy access off the freeway. From the west just off the off ramp .from going east it is a little harder you need to go over the freeway. and it is there. Friendly staff prices are fair.< /review>

It's a gas station has your typical snacks for a gas station. They have bathroom but you get about 2 mins before they start knocking on the door rushing you to take care of biz. Couple friendly clerks but couple rude ones but then aren't behind the counter much so good management. Only go there in a pinch.</review>

<Text>This place ROCKS! The store and station are always well stocked and clean every time I go in, the staff is professional and efficient, everything about this family owned station makes me a repeat customer. They also have a dumping station for rv's and sell propane.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures></record>

Very convenient going northbound on highway 1 - you can get off, fuel up, and right back on. They also have free air for your tires and water, and even a dump station for RVs, and propane tanks. Before the remodel they used to wash your windows too, miss the nice man who did that.< /review>

Unbelievable I would post a 5 star review for a gas station/convenience store, but after traveling the northern to southern CA route so many times, with so many stops at icky gas stations for a restroom and a snack, I can honestly say this was the best stop. Snack selection was what you'd expect, but restrooms were spotless, and perhaps most of all (really the tipping point for me to decide to review a gas station convenience store) was the cashier -- professional, courteous and friendly. I was taken aback. The staff at this stop for seem to take pride in their service, and it shows. Keep it up, guys!</review>

Shame on you 76 station manager for having our jeep towed away! My wife and 6 year old granddaughter had car trouble and were given permission to park at the station. I was in millbrae caring for my 92 year old mother. I had the AAA card and had to come back to Santa Cruz to get the jeep towed but before I got there 76 had it towed. It cost us $400.< /review>

<review>Drove forever to find this dump station advertised as 24 hours got here at 10:09 on a moving permit a wing and a prayer only to be refused because they close at 10 . Really rude and inconsiderate of customers time gas money and extremely frustrating so NOT A HAPPY CAMPER AT ALL . it's a SELF SERVICE STATION that wouldn't let me SELF SERVE AND frankly WONT EVER COME BACK Oh and prices are off the charts and attendant a JERK< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I used to come here to dump my RV and get propane.  Now they charge to much to dump and the propane is priced outrageously high. I'm not joking its a dollar more here than anywhere else, straight greed. Thanks for making a loyal customer feel ripped off. I will not be coming back< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
This place is a sweet place just waiting to welcome all so peacefully. I really enjoyed his quiet and peaceful my stay was. Every staff member to me was a breath if fresh air . The world is crazy right now during the pandemic. This place even though everyone wire their mask appropriately..  This places vibe made me while I was there... Forget for just a few looking at the beautiful fountain that's is beautifully lit with pretty tea lights. They have a smoking area that's very relaxing. All of the guest I came across was just as pleasant. Being there was so relaxing. Not a big crowd(I really loved his cozy it is) The whole area has something to do. Bikes are included to enjoy the scenes of the local area. It's also very clean!!! Yes indeed! I celebrated my birthday there with my family... I wish I was still there..  In the hot tub! Love you guys! I'll be back if you'll have me!< /review>

If you are interested in a smaller, friendly, very laid-back vibe, this is your hotel. My wife & I instantly fell in love with this place. We enjoyed the thoroughly kind staff and interacted with some very nice guests and yes if you just want to vege & possibly read a book, I did that too.<//Review>

<text>Hotel California is my favorite hotel in Palm Springs, I always stay there. It’s a perfect boutique hotel with only 14 rooms. It’s never crowded and you always feel like you’re returning home. The staff is always outstanding and accommodating. You really can’t ask for more, and I’m always looking forward to my next trip to stay there.  The pool and hot tub are great!  You can use them 24hrs a day, which is rare.  Most importantly, its always clean. Will be booking my next getaway to stay there very soon.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80db1b13fcc165ef:0x1aab09af16cb60c< /GmapID></record>

The room was the last one available. Was an adjoining  room nicely done comfy Murphy bed. Equipped with Mini frig, microwave and coffee maker.  NO Utensils in room. Shared kitchen down stairs is well equipped  with gas cooktop. Very nice staff.  Cozy Jacuzzi tucked in a private spot. Other than no elevator the ONLY downside with this room was the incredible noise level from the room adjoining. Although there is more than 6"of space to install insultation between the rooms it has not been done.  Creating a double door to enter each room is how I've seen it done effectively.  More secure for guests not adjoining as I was.  Beach cruisers provided free to ride to restaurants.< /text>

<review>It’s really cute, got great staff and kitchen! Playroom is fun too. We soak in hot tub every night. Pool is heated. The only down side is that for a hotel that looks four star,the bed is not comfortable. I can feel the coil all night. But to those who have good backs and want to have a palm spring experience, it’s really great and cheap option.<//review>< Pics>

Our hosts were friendly and gracious. We were literally taken on a tour of the small, but beautifully landscaped grounds. The pool is heated to 92 degrees making swimming on a cool evening a delightful experience. The grounds are meticulously kept with just the right amount of greenery to make us feel like we were in a tropical escape.
Our room was from another era. It was very clean, comfortable and well cared for.
There are only a few rooms which gave us a sense of exclusivity. The night was very quiet and we slept peacefully. The housekeeper was also friendly and down to the details in keeping the area clean and comfortable. What a great escape during this messed up COVID-19 world!
Thank you for a great stay!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgNpFRBle6DsBTopxYTnW4YLwkYbBEqqMFTQFB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3v7ubS4SLX_yERFHC_i4aKh13fHnUOt2Ty-5h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80db1b13fcc165ef:0x1aab09af16cb60c< /gmapID></record>

<Review>I wouldn’t have booked in here if I’d known they were on a busy road and you can hear the traffic in your room at night. If you’re privileged enough to live in a place where it’s quiet at night, the cars going by will keep you up.Also, PLEASE stop using plastic water bottles! They are so bad for the environment, we can all do better than this.<//Review><time>1616025600000</time>< rate>

The staff at Hotel California is amazing. Every single encounter was extremely gracious. Maria knew I was celebrating a big birthday and was so kind to send us pink champagne. Everybody else was just as thoughtful. The pool is gorgeous and the music piped in is classic. I love this place and would definitely recommend it.< /review>

<Text>After 20 years of going to Palm Springs and staying at the same hotel I ventured out and stayed two nights at Hotel California. I was so pleased and surprised by this gem. Super private, exceptionally clean, warm heated pool and great jacuzzi. The community kitchen is amazing and I am planning on doing mindfulness retreats there. It would be the perfect spot.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80db1b13fcc165ef:0x1aab09af16cb60c< /gmap_id></record>

<review>Very quaint mission style casitas. Natural landscaping, small but adequate heated pool. Desk personnel were very accommodating. Tv cable connection issue fixed by desk person first night. Coffee room with a toaster and fresh brew. A welcome break from the hotel chains. Will be back.</review>< Pics>

Livin it up at the hotel california, what a nice surprise. Bring your alibis. Mirrors in the ceiling and pink champagne on ice, she said we are all just prisoners here of our own demise, and in the masters chambers they gathered for the feast, they stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast. Last thing I remember I was running for the door. I had to find a passage back to the place I was before, relax said the nightman we are programed to receive, you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

This place is truly wonderful.  The staff is amazing. The staff caters to your every need, without feeling oppressive.  The rooms are clean and very nicely decorated. This is the only hotel I would ever stay at in Palm Springs.< /Review>

Hotel California is a beautiful boutique hotel in downtown Palm Springs. Conveniently located, super clean and with an amazing staff. Everyone is there to help you out to have a memorable accommodation. We enjoyed the Jacuzzi at night. So romantic and unique. Perfect for your getaway!< /text>

<text>The hotel is nice enough, but I was disappointed to find that both my ground floor patio space and upstairs balcony were shared with the room across from mine. Sliding glass doors faced theirs. Since I had no privacy, I didn’t use either outdoor space and kept the curtains closed.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80db1b13fcc165ef:0x1aab09af16cb60c<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I chose this hotel based on their amazing ratings and the really cool Spanish mission vibe (also I knew I could remember the name!). It has a resort feel with the hospitality of a warm bed and breakfast. My husband and I just stayed one night but would be happy to return. Maria was an excellent host and very accommodating. She truely cared about our experience and wanted to give us the best room that suited us-we were moving out of state and had a moving truck and car carrier-she gave us a great room where we could easily see the car..and it was steps from the pool and spa! We were offered complimentary drinks when we first arrived and our fridge and room also had drinks. The guest lounge has a library and movie library and there is a full sized kitchen available too. The amenities are great! We can't wait to return!</Review>

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, "We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax", said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"< /Text>

Nothing I can say hasn't all ready been said about this place. The 5 star reviews are accurate and deserved. Customer service is excellent. Amenities are well above what you'll ever get at a chain hotel. Comfortable and relaxing.< /Text>

This was our fourth year to visit Hotel California. In fact, we’ve booked the next two years. We enjoy the staff, they are great people.

Maria, the general manager deserves a special shout out. She makes everyone comfortable and feel like they are part of Hotel California Family.

Loved our stay. The treehouse rooms are fairly secluded if that's what you're looking for. They have a nice jacuzzi along with a heated pool. The whole property is softly lit worth candles in the evening which looks great.

Larry was a great host.<//Review>

This place is an oasis! A boutique hotel that is catered towards adults. Absolutely wonderful! The ladie's were amazing with free wine or beer when we showed up to bringing popsicles as we lounged around the pool.<//text>

A great desert oasis weekend getaway! I had an amazing time here at hotel california. Upon arriving I was offered wine or beer. The rooms are like having your own apartment. Came with snacks and drinks. Bycicles where included with our stay. The pool and Jacuzzis were both perfect. Just wish they disnt close the Jacuzzi down so early. The smoking area was awesome and was 420 friendly!  They offered fruit and pay mean 24 hours. Deff a great cheap stay I will be back!<//Review>

<name>patrick wildridge<//name><Text>My wife and I had a family wedding in Palm Springs. Not knowing the area very well, we researched hotels near the wedding venue. I must admit that we chose Hotel California because of the name.   So glad we did.  Great little 15 room boutique hotel with nice little pool but the staff and small touch amenities is what made it a winner. Maria and her team couldn’t have been nicer or more accommodating in every way.  Thanks Maria !!!
Definitely consider this place if visiting Palm Springs< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>The grounds are beautiful and the staff is very guest-focused. It’s so peaceful, and with only 14 rooms, you feel much more in a home environment rather than a hotel environment. The rooms are very spacious, and all are very close to the pool, where we spent most of our time. I can’t say enough good things about Maria, Jay, and Betty, who go above and beyond to make all the guests feel welcome. We are making this our “go to” place for relaxing getaways and for every Fathers Day weekend. I love love love Hotel California!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I can not say enough good things about Hotel California. My husband stumbled upon it right before Labor Day weekend and they just happened to have one room left. We booked it and headed out.
Adults only so no worry about children running around. If you have kids but need a break, this is the place. Each room has a kitchenette if not a full kitchen. There is a full kitchen (minus a stove) on site that you have access too with two grills. It’s nice because if you don’t feel like eating out you do have the option to cook. Bonus, Ralphs grocery store is just down the road!

The office staff is very friendly. They have no problem answering questions and drawing in the map for you. Want to hot tips on where to go? Ask one of them!

The pool is 24/7 they just ask that you keep your yap shut after 10pm. A lot of the rooms have unique things: Room 15 has its own cute private seating area, Room 2 has its on reserved pool lounges, another room has its own private balcony with grill etc.

Pool is heated and has some umbrellas over it so when it was 115° we didn’t know, between the shade and the misters it’s heaven.

Since discovering it we’ve been multiple times! We’re back celebrating Christmas with my in-laws and we’ve already reserved our room for next Labor Day weekend. So like I said, I can’t say enough good things about it. Come try it for yourself!<//Review>

We were on a road trip and we wanted to check out Palm Springs, and we were happy to get a reservation at the Hotel California (not that one). When we arrived we were greeted at the door by Larry, who led us into the office and gave us chilled beverages while we checked in. The grounds are beautiful, with lush, tropical foliage and misters which helped us to keep cool in the summer heat. Jay gave us a comprehensive tour and led us to our room which was supplied with snacks and cold water. The pool and hot tub area are equipped with unique shade umbrellas and are a great place to spend time relaxing. All of the rooms have an outside sitting area. We walked to a Mexican restaurant and had a great meal.  We would have liked to stay longer, but we had commitments down the road. When we checked out Larry gave us iced waters and even washed the bugs off our windshield! We would like to return when we have more time to enjoy the atmosphere at the Hotel California in Palm Springs.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>This was our second time staying at Hotel California and my word was it just as memorable as the first. We stayed in the townhouse again, and we will forever book that room when we return. Maria is a gem of a human being on a multitude of levels (she washed and folded our laundry for zero in return... we offered but she didn't want a bar of it... oh my, so wonderful). Larry even put Vegemite and a bottle of sparkling in our room... he is a legend. This is one of the best places we have ever stayed and I cannot wait until the next time. Their hospitality is flawless and unheard of. They do it right every time. Very impressed. The pool/communal kitchen/BBQ/hot tub... all so wonderful. A wonderful stay, as expected. We will see you guys December 2019... We cannot wait!</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This hotel is a quaint jewel waiting to be enjoyed by a very few people who know where it is. Staff is very attentive. The walking areas are watered down daily. Clean pool & jacuzzi. Smoking is only allowed outside of their gates. We definately would return! 🥰</review>

Wow!

I was looking for something unique and I found that and then some!

The personal attention to detail is beyond anything I have experienced. As one who entertains on a boat for a living, if I were to take my hospitality on shore, this would be what I would do.  Unexpected amenities, anticipation and a preparedness to meet your guests needs is all in a days work for these guys, but unexpected for anyone who stays and wants to experience Palm Springs.

<name>Logan Weight</name>< Review>
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night.
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face.
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say"
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face.
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

<Review>Hotel California is a wonderful place to stay. The staff are really helpful and lovely. The rooms are cute and clean. They have a hot tub, pool, community room, BBQ, kitchen for the guests to use. There are small number of rooms so very intimate and comfortable place. For the guests the following is all free: dvds, bikes (to ride) beer, wine, and snacks. I have stayed in many hotels and this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I will stay there again in the future.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

My wife and I reunited with two other couples at the Hotel California in early February. We had a great time in a beautiful hotel. Larry and the staff were all welcoming, friendly and accommodating. One couple had the townhouse, with lots of extra space to hang in. Another had a room with a kitchen, where we gathered frequently. My wife and I had a standard room, which was clean, comfortable and roomy. Even though the temperature got a little brisk for a couple of days, the pool was warm and the spa was warmer. This hotel is conveniently located, quiet (we made it noisier), with a beautiful courtyard, great sitting areas, a nice kitchen with coffee and fruit every morning and facilities to make your own meal. It's small enough to offer that boutique feel and for every guest to know the staff. This was our second trip to Hotel California, and we'll be back.<//text>

it was the best hotel  iv ever been to. when in palm springs its the place to stay 5 stars

This place was intimate and welcoming.  The proprietor, Lucy, knew who we were when we came in the front gate.  The rooms are large and ours upstairs was very private with a deck & table and great views of the grounds.  Candles were lit on every outdoor table every evening.  Lush landscape felt tropical.  Pool & spa open 24/7.  A perfect place for a romantic get-away.  We met the nicest people.  Overall a truly wonderful experience.</Text>

<Review>If you are looking for a small family-run hotel in Palm Springs, look no further. This is the place! We booked online while looking for a place to stay in Palm Springs, and wanted to avoid the standard resort hotel. We didn’t know what to expect when we arrived, but we soon felt that we had moved in with long-lost family: Larry, Jay, Lucy, Betty, and Mike. What an amazing crew! They made you feel welcome and waited-upon, without any being overbearing. (Seriously, we wish our relatives were like this!) The hotel itself is small, only 12 rooms, clean, with well-appointed efficiency units, surrounding a garden courtyard and pool, all with a touch of California funkiness. There is a large common kitchen off the courtyard where you could hang out and share a cup of coffee with guests or staff as you might wish. For those of you who have travelled in Europe, this felt like the California incarnation of the small family hotel. It couldn't have been better!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night.
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face.
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say"

<Review>I love this Hotel! It is my slice of heaven. A beautiful friendly staff that makes sure your needs are met and that you are comfortable. They go above and beyond and become family instantly. The hotel is quaint and extremely comfortable, there is a beautiful pool that goes from 3'-7'. A well maintained common area including a communal kitchen. A lovely hot tub, stunning gardens filled with Hummingbirds. The rooms have everything you could possibly need, its the little details like, iron & board, tea, coffee, complimentary snacks, water and soda's, toiletries, even febreeze spray in the bathroom! There are bicycle's you can use to explore town. I came with my 13 yr old and was just passing through on a long road trip. We were so delighted that we have vowed to come back again and again!!! I could go on for days about all the special things I love about this Hotel, but its best you experience it for yourself, I highly recommend. Thank you so much Larry, Betty, Jay, and Mike, we think you are AWESOME!</Review></record>

Had the most wonderful 4 days at Hotel California. Such a relaxing atmosphere. The staff is both professional and personable, great guys who made me feel right at home. Highly, highly recommend staying there. This was my 5th visit to Palm Springs and now I have found the place I will return to instead of searching for a great place. I have found the place now.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Hotel California is the quintessential retro hotel and classic Palm Spring experience.  We stayed at there on May 21 & 22, 2014.  We loved the accommodations and found the service exceptional.  Curly, the hotel manager, is well versed in the art of hospitality.  He was a lot of fun and made our stay comfortable and relaxing.  The staff overall was extremely helpful and friendly and went out of their way to accommodate our vacation needs. The rooms are cute and roomy and very clean.  The pool is on the smaller side but the common area surrounding the pool were gorgeous with plants and flowers and various seating areas and were extremely well maintained.  There is also an outdoor spa, bikes and bbq area for use at any time.  We only regret that we could stay 2 nights and look forward to returning as soon as we can.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

This is one of the few places I vacation where the hotel alone is worth the visit.  This hotel is adults only and only has I think 12 rooms so it's never very crowded.  Because of the small size the staff and guests are all on a first name basis.  ALL amenities are included: bike rentals, international long distance, snacks, movie rentals, computer usage and the WiFi is incredible.<//Text>

Rooms are clean, though a bit older. It's kept up well. Big plus is the staff and other guests. They are fantastic. Friendly, helpful. Only 14 rooms so we got to know half the guests and all the staff by name. We will see them again soon.</review>

So here's the story: I was on a dark desert highway, with cool wind in my hair, and the highway smelled like colitas. I didn't know medical marijuana was legal, and it detracted from the environment.  Anyway, I saw a light in the distance it was, really, sort of a shimmering light. My eyes grew tired, and I needed to stop for the night.
There was a very attractive lady in the doorway when I checked in. She showed me to my room with a candle as a light (you need to update your lights, people.) The other guests at the hotel in the corridor said "Hey, Welcome to the Hotel California. It really is such a lovely place." Other guests seemed to express interest in the attractive hostess, and some guests were often found dancing in the courtyard. I then called up the captain and said "Please bring me my wine." He said "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969." I was confused. Wine wasn't a spirit.
The people sang in the night, and it woke me up and did not make for a pleasurable sleeping experience. There were unsettling mirrors on the ceiling (baked your room like an oven.) There was also pink champagne (pink champagne but no wine?) and the hotel administration trying to eat meat raw, by stabbing a beast. The shrieks were annoying. The hostess told me, somewhat cynically, "We are all just prisoners here of our own device."
The last thing I remember, I was heading for the door. I had to get back to the place I was before. The night man was friendly to the guests, but he said "Relax. We are programmed to receive. You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave."
I exploited this loophole and checked out. Now I get a free hotel room and they can't kick me out!  It was all worth it, and this new prison is awesome! Five Stars!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say"
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face.
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man,
'We are programmed to receive.
You can check out any time you like,
But you can never leave!'< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

< review>
This is one of the very best places to revitalize your soul.  The guests are typically outgoing and very social, and given the communal kitchen and only 11 rooms  being social is a necessity.  The staff and owners are absolutely fantastic.  Curly, the main manager is incredible, they all attend to your every need.  This was our first time and we are committed to making this an annual pilgrimage for longer and longer stays!  I really can't say enough good things.  I travel the US for work and go to some amazing places and amazing hotels - nothing beats this - bar none.< /review>

<Gmap_id>0x80db1b13fcc165ef:0x1aab09af16cb60c< /Gmap_id><text>I don't normally write reviews online but my wife and I had such a great experience at the Hotel California that I am just compelled to share what a great group of people run this place and what a place this is.  We stayed in room #3 (of 14 if I  recall correctly) and it was a perfect little getaway studio.  Very clean and open room, comfortable bed, excellent pink towels (the white towels were a little rougher but still nice), nice decoration touches and a couple of tables with chairs (one just outside our door in the patio area).  It was close to the hot tub (about 25-30 feet away) and only a few more feet away from the pool (partial pool view).  I can't say enough about Lucy and her Dad (Larry).  They really made us feel welcome and became a big part of making our 1-night getaway special.  We didn't get to take the free limo ($5 tip per person each way suggested) since we were running late for dinner and the limo service was only available until 10pm (which is understandable).  You also need to know that besides hardworking and customer oriented they are honest - I left my wallet in one of the night stand drawers and didn't realize it until 8 hours after checking out.  Lucy gave me a call only an hour after leaving (but I missed it) and she sent me an email to let me know.  Unfortunately we were 40 miles away by the time I returned her call so she suggested that she would just mail my wallet back to me (and wouldn't accept a reward).  Needless to say the Hotel California holds a very special place in our hearts as does the staff.  If you're looking for a quiet place to enjoy some alone time in a quaint place with lots of character and ambiance...you've found this jewel.  We haven't stopped talking about this place since we returned - ALL of our friends are hearing about what a great time we had in Palm Springs a few days ago.  Again...THANK YOU Lucy, Larry and Jay - you made my wife's birthday really special this year.  See you soon.< /text>< Name>

Absolutely Delightful

We are really pleased to have found Hotel California. This is a delightful place to explore beautiful Palm Springs from. The service is great - we were offered a glass of wine to relax the moment we reached. The staff were super helpful and friendly.

We stayed two nights. Even though we had to switch rooms (from Room 7 to Room 3) because the hotel was full, it was no hassle.

Loved that there is a full kitchen and BBQs at the hotel as well. Great to be able to whip up some of our own food rather eat out all the time. Hotel California provides all the condiments for the cooking one needs. A Ralph's supermarket is nearby for one to buy all the food needed for cooking.

Hotel California does not provide breakfast but there's always fresh fruit, bread, and coffee / tea available in the kitchen. We make our own sandwiches for brekkie - simple with the toaster and griddle.

There's also a guest lounge / shared living room area with over 300 DVDs for those who want to stay in. You can watch the DVDs in your own room too.

What more can one ask for? :)</review>

Eine Oase in der Hotellandschaft. Klein, fein und persönlich herzlich. Solche Hotels sind schwer zu finden. Man fühlt sich wohl gleich vom ersten Augenblick an. Wir hatten ein riesiges Apartment, mit 2 Bädern, eine voll ausgestattet Küche, Wohn-Esszimmer, einem grossen Schlafzimmer mit 2 Betten und eine kleine private Terrasse mit Gasgrill. Es war wirklich alles vorhanden und liebevoll eingerichtet.</Text>

<response>None< /response><Review>Sehr angenehme Atmosphäre, sehr sauber, sehr netter Empfang, hilfsbereite Mitarbeiter, sehr gut ausgestattete Gemeinschaftsküche (und super sauber!) mit ganztägig Kaffee und frischem Obst. Supermarkt ca 1 km entfernt. Nach Downtown fährt ein kostenloser Shuttle, dort gibt es sehr viele Restaurants; am Pool gab es ausreichend Liegen und Spühnebel, wodurch sogar die 46 Grad angenehm waren. Insgesamt waren wir rundum zufrieden und haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt.< /Review>< GmapID>

<text>Happy houuuuurrr

Well since I'm going on week seven of having no new cases at work (and therefore no income), I'm starting to get a lot more excited about the happy hour deals around LA. I'd like to keep going out to eat, but I'd also like to continue to afford rent.

I've had this place bookmarked for a while, and one morning as I was getting my car washed, my housemate asked me to find a place for us to eat where we could take her dog. Scrolling through the options as the soapy water ran down my windows, I came upon this cute little restaurant that was a bit of a drive but had beer, food, and a patio. That was all we needed.

She had some errands to run first so I arrived about thirty minutes before her and sat at the bar. To my delight I discovered that I had arrived just after happy hour started, and that they have a pretty decent happy hour menu.

I started off with a beer that I finished once she arrived, and then I got a happy hour cocktail. I don't remember the name of it, just that it had elderflower as an ingredient.

The only thing that I didn't like about this place was how comically small the patio was. It was seriously the width of two adults standing shoulder to shoulder, and the length of one side of the building(which isn't too large). There weren't more than five tables and two bars squished back there, and just barely enough room for her husky under the table.

Our server was so sweet though! He brought out water and dog treats for her dog and the treats came on a little plate with a napkin. I was surprised how little I felt that I needed to call the server for something, considering we were in the corner on the patio. He was so attentive and just seemed like a really nice person.

I ordered the turkey burger from the HH menu (mostly because it came with fries) and it was actually pretty good. I would order it again, and definitely recommend it to anyone who would like poultry over red meat.

My housemate got a beer, chili cheese fries (with bacon jam!) and a chili cheese dog. Honestly I don't know how she stays so thin. I tried some of the fries with the jam and it was delicious.

We also decided to use the check in offer and split the bread pudding. It was the perfect end to a great lunch--though next time I'd try it with the whiskey ice cream rather than the vanilla.

5/5, will certainly return.<//text>< pics>

mexican food and service at this spot is very good. The service was very sociable and kind. It has an awesome atmosphere. Similar to a cafe in Las Vegas I liked.< /Review>

<text>Great place for some quick lunch! Every part of the sandwich was good including the bun, the meat(I got marinated beef, my girlfriend got marinated chicken). The food comes out very quickly. They were having issues with the credit card machine when I was there, and altought it ended up going through, I'd bring a $20 just to be sure. There is parking in front of the store, and there's a lot of street parking in the area.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Solid hole in a wall eatery with huge cemitas that are very filling. The barbacoa cemita with jalapeños, fresh onions, and cheese had a great flavor profile. Really loved how the flavors combined with the avocado too. The bottom half of the sandwich was my favorite because all the barbacoa juice ran down there while I was eating and it was significantly juicier. This sandwich would be even better if it was served with that juice as a dipping sauce on the side!</review>

A Cemita is a Torta (Mexican sandwich) with attitude. Traditionally served without meat, the better to complete your sandwich with freshly grilled meats from food vendors, they are a tradition of the Southern Mexican State of Puebla. You can get a "Traditional" which is a great lacto-vegetarian meal, or get yours with any number of meats featured. I have had Pollo Adobada, which is marinated grilled chicken, Milanesa de Pollo which is fried chicken, and the surprisingly good grilled salmon. Everything is fresh here. And Mexican Futbol (Soccer) matches are always on. Suggestion, BYO Swiss army knife if you have kids or light eaters, they don't cut these huge sandwiches in two for you.< /Review>

Oh my goodness gracious, these sandwiches are SO SO SO GOOD!!! They are gigantic--they have like an entire avocado in them! And luckily, they hold up surprisingly well, so when you have meal #2 out of this sandwich, you're not trying to slurp up a soppy sandwich. Definitely spring for the cheese upgrade, it goes perfectly with their juicy and flavourful-as-heck fillings. And plan on taking this flying saucer of a sandwich to go because the place is tiny... Hey, what they lack in restaurant space, they more than make up in sandwich size.<//text>

I dont know what vegetable it is they put in the cemitas but it tastes very good. I randomly stumbled upon this hole in the wall and can vouch that its pretty comparable to Tortas Chingonas.

They were pretty expensive, thought they were pretty big with a good amount meat. We got the shredded chicken option and it was very good! The bread, which is what differs it from a torta, was very good! The texture, the flavor it was very delicious. I just have one complaint, they charge you extra if you get jalapeños! Dividing up the cost like that is not cool, just like the people that charge for getting salsa. If I'm paying $22 for two tortas that one can definitely make at home and taking them to go......I would not want to pay extra for the canned jalapeños.< /review>

<Review>I love this place. A friend introduced me to Don Adrian's a few years back and every few months I get a craving for their cemitas. I pretty much have a standard order; a barbacoa cemita and a fish cemita. I like them best with the jalapeno and string cheese. It's a small store with 3 benches so we usually don't eat there. If you pay with a card there's a small fee so if that's an issue bring cash. The cemitas are about $10 each. If you pay by card, there is no way to add a tip so be aware. I highly recommend Don Adrian's.</Review>< pictures>

It's an excellent restaurant, best tortas! but unfortunately nothing is ever all good. I had the worst costumer service by a server named Liliana. She made us wait for twenty minutes for our order for two and served others that walked in after us. And I wasn't busy like other days. She just had it against us and even had the nerve to tell us that we haven't been waiting that long. When we finally got our order she threw the food at us through the small window. I hope that doesn't ever happen to anyone, it is about the food but the costumer service should be equally great.< /Review>

Horrible experience. Very bad customer service they have bad attitudes. Horrible food no flavor what so ever tacos fell into pieces. They thought my wife didnt speak spanish while they were talking about her so my wife just walked up to them and told them that she understood every word they said so they both just walked away and got to work.
I had to apologize to my family for taking them there.
Worst place.</text>

Btw, this one is better than their location on Van Nuys, I there is hardly anywhere to sit but it is better!!!

Also, I feel the need to clarify this. This is NOT a torta. This is a traditional sandwich from Puebla, Mexico. Although they mostly resemble those made in the nearby state of Oaxaca. It has plenty of flavor. Whoever complains there is non must have ordered it plain. There is way more flavor in these than there could ever be in a torta.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Awesome Pueblan style Mexican food in a teeny tiny spot. I'd recommend number 7 which is their regular beef sandwich(cemita) or my favorite the tacote de desayuno (giant breakfast taco) . Also if they ask if you want "pappalo" don't pass up on it. It's like some lemony leafy green that they put that adds that extra zing to an already dynamic flavor profile.< /Text>< Pictures>

Hi I'm just want to say that I'm a Mexican and if you don't speak Spanish , don't even try to go to this place , because the employee don't speak English and they gonna make your order wrong or you gonna end up having something totally different of what you order , even for me that I speak Spanish is way to difficult to comunicate with the people who work there ! This is not the first time they get my order wrong. , and when I ask to get a new cemita they refused to make a new one and instead they gave me my money back ! I told them I don't want my mine back I just want a new cemita because I was hungry , but they refused to make a new one .
Some other time I when there and I asked to have my cemita cut in half and they refused to cut it in half ! I ask why? And they told me that they not allow to cut cemita in half !
What a dumm answer!!
There is no customer satisfaction in this place I even call the owner to place a complaint but he gave me this BS and he didn't do anything about it ! That is way I won't ever go back to this place or the one on Van Nuys Blvd because they belong to the same owner< /Review>

They used to be good customer service but it was simply they are very rude and the three tasks like we asking something out of our mind we only ask for cutting in a half or sandwich and they make a big deal out of it
I will never go again in this place</Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I had a good time that I didn't visit that place, it was one of my favorites. But today I did not like them in the least they changed the bread. Besides that they ask you if with potato, what if with cheese ... Q if cheese, they just ask me if with meat they charge for each thing they put on it, a cemita is supposed to be characterized by the potato. And it turns out that they charge you. thinking of never coming back. It does not matter if it is expensive, it is worth it. And this is expensive and they are not good.

(Original)
Tenía un buen q no visitaba ese lugar era uno de mis favoritos. Pero el día de hoy no me gustaron en lo mas mínimo cambiaron el pan. Ademas de q te preguntan q si con papalo, que si con queso... Q si quesillo, ya mero me preguntan q si con carne cobran por cada cosa que le ponen se supone una cemita se caracteriza por el papalo. Y resulta q te lo cobran.  pensando en no volver a regresar. No importa si esta caro q valga la pena. Y esto esta caro y no estan buenas.</Review>

(Translated by Google) June 19, 2020 8:00 pm I am a client of more than 15 years. One more client or one less. But those who attend the business. They have to respect customers. Today I traveled for 40 to buy my cemitas. I go back to my house. And the cemitas did not have papalo, perhaps that detail is insignificant for some. But not for me. If I call and when I make my order they tell me there is no papalo. I do not buy. The point is that you call disappointed to make the claim. And the person who answers the call. He answers me with a very ugly attitude. And he just laughed. As I explained to him. All the time I was respectful in my claim. I was expecting an apology. Or at least. Total no avia way to solve. I live 30 miles away.

Regreso a mi casa. Y las cemitas no tenían papalo,  quisas ese detalle sea insignificante para algunos. Pero para mí no. Si yo llamo y al hacer mi orden me dicen no hay papalo. No compro. El punto es que llame decepcionado a hacer el reclamo. Y la persona que me atiende la llamada. Me contesta con una actitud muy fea. Y solo se reía. Mientra le explicaba. Todo el tiempo fui respetuoso.en mi reclamo. Esperaba un disculpa. O al menos. Total no avia manera de solucionar. Vivo a 30 millas de distancia.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I thought of a regular seed! The price seemed high until they served me a barbecue semita, large well prepared excellent flavor, then I realized that the previous one is adequate and very well invested! The place is small and busy, more attention is fast!

(Original)
Pensé en una semita regular! El precio me pareció alto hasta q me sirvieron una semita de barbacoa , grande bien preparada excelente sabor, entonces me Di cuenta q el previo es adecuado y muy bien invertido! El lugar es pequeño yy concurrido , más la atención es rápida!!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The Cemitas are really delicious.
The downside is that the place is very small.
You can't eat there.
They need to expand the place.
The staff is very attentive.
It is always clean.

(Translated by Google) A little supper without papalo is just a common cake and they sell cemites without papalo. They said that because of the weather but they charge the same as a small church ..

Una cenita sin papalo es sólo una torta común y ellos venden cemitas sin papalo. Dijeron que por el clima pero las cobran igual como una cemita..</Review>

< Review>
I would rate it 10 stars because it is absolute perfection. Everything was phenomenal. The energy, the customer service, the music, the atmosphere, and the Sugar! It was indeed a perfect restaurant save the limited menu.

I can't really fault them for the menu. They did their best despite having limited items. My wife told the server that it was my birthday but I was diabetic, she still found a way to bring me a dessert that I could eat a little bit of!

I know I'm into minority so someone else will probably give him five stars. My only knock was that I don't like the way they made the hot wings. I know my taste are particular and not in a majority. I do promise everything else was perfect. It's a perfect place to take your friends, family, people visiting for out of town, business meetings, anything, anybody that just wants to have fun.</Review>

The atmosphere and entertainment was unexpected and great, but the food needs work. The Alfredo was pasty. The Sampler was super skimpy for the price. Overall I’d go back because the whole family had fun due to the staff.</Text>

<Review>We enjoyed ourselves, the staff is very kind and energetic. Great Vibe and food was pretty good but. not amazing! I will say this, the drinks were delicious and amazing big enough to share for the price if you wanted. The dessert looked yummy and worthy of a picture post for social media.My only complaint is the waiting to order. get our food and check .I understand. maybe under staff but it's Saturday at 1pm so maybe hire more for weekends.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Waited a bit for water and our server but once she came everything went great. She got our order completely right and the drinks were really good! Little skimpy on the ranch sides and they drowned the salad in too much dressing. Like way too much, it became soup more then a salad. Other then that it was a great experience. $300 lunch and lots of pictures to remember!</Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Don't get me wrong the view and backdrop of the flowers are beautiful but food isn't all that great. I got the spaghetti with marinara sauce & meatballs and I personally think the pasta was better at Denny's. For those who likes their drinks strong then the goblet is the one for you! The drink is good enough for 2-3 people.<//Review>

<Review>Sugar factory was a hype.. It reminded me of a more "urban" "hip" cheesecake factory with less food options.. Its a cool experience for adults & kids but mainly for the youth.. The drinks didn't taste as good as they look. My nieces loved it tho so if you got kids, its a go! 🤝🏁< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgFIZfeJKHydvapMov_a-MORVBK_1v3AaZmtW9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxwuHDtp3PAdP1S46Si9MYUHyDty87CcCHcu_h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1618349394235, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review Sugar Factory!

I am leaving a 5 star review because the service I received for my son 16th birthday was EVERYTHING! Garret is such a stand up guy. He went above and beyond with his excellent service! He is definitely an asset to this franchise! And no, he did not ask me to write this.... I am just giving credit when credit it due!!! I love this place!< /review>

The Candy shop for sure, music playing, turn up spot, waiters and waitress dancing. If you like to turn up this is the spot. Bring your $$$. Good food with a twist on it. Reservation required. Celebrity spot. Behave!! Covid regulated!<//Review>

Today was my first time at this establishment. I can truly say I had a good time. I absolutely loved the way they celebrate birthdays. Not your regular happy birthday song. Will be going back in June for daughter's birthday!</Review>

<text>I've been to this location twice in the past 2 months. The first time, there was no indoor dining and the second time (today) was limited indoor seating.

RAVES: really friendly and accommodating staff (one of the times we were there one of our guests wanted to move to a different table and they did it, no problem, despite being busy; and today a server was just going around setting up the umbrellas for all outdoor tables), easy check in (we had reservations both times ; we waited a little both times to be seated but they text you when your table is ready so you can walk around if you want), yummy milk shakes and drinks, good food, and fun atmosphere.

RANTS:. While I watch them do a great job of wiping down tables before seating them...the outdoor area needed a little love.  The seat covers were dirty, the floor and carpets were very dirty/sticky, and the tables have little slots that were full of food and dirt than fell in and was either stuck or not cleaned out.

Knowing a lot of places are short staffed, the "rants" area may be situational.  One thing I'd recommend to Sugar Factory is investing in handhelds or iPad minis so servers can enter orders at the table. Because the drink menu is extensive, and some drinks can be labor intensive, it may help to have them entered at the table instead of servers having to write it down and go stand in line at a POS. Not to mention most parties are larger for celebrating. This can save time so servers can attend to other tables and customers may have shorter wait times.

I DO recommend this place though, especially for a special occasion, it's a great location!!!!  I'd recommend going either during the week or before 2pm on weekends and make a reservation 😁😁😁<//text><user_id>103238338314712182117< /user_id><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2bb8c8c000001:0xa792c16503a23529</GmapID>< Name>

This place is legit!!! Food was great and was all fresh. We had 25 people come for my wife's birthday. Everyone was impressed with the food. We got the giant ice cream sundae and the dance for you. We had a plastic here. This is a must try.</text>

The service was so bad went for my son birthday had a reservation for 10:00 waited for 45 minutes to be seated. Then the hostess refused to bring a highchair because we have seven people and the table seats 6 if I bring it my manager will come talk to you guys about having too many at a table. My family is seated we wait 20 minutes for them to fine us waiter after I complained about sitting there do so long. Finally, get a waiter she not very happy to be at work I guess, forgets my drink order no extra plates or napkins. The food was so bad I will never go back it was the worst. Their booking system needs to be fixed I did my reservation online and when you try to book for 7 the site tells you to call so I called and the message on the phone says to book online.<//review>

Arrived for my 11:30am reservation and was seated within minutes.  I waited about 45 minutes for our waiter before I had to finally get up and hunny someone down to take our order.  Finally one of the ladies in a dress shirt came and took it for us.  Food was out 15 minutes later.  Waited 5 minutes after the food for utensils and another 20 minutes for our drinks.  Our table was cleared and cleaned and I had to flag someone down after 20 minutes of waiting for the check.😒</text>

Took had to watch parties of 20 and 30 being seated before we did after have a reservation for weeks. I had a party of 10 and a 10 month old that they counted apart of the party. Our waiter was nowhere to be found and when found extremely rude. Reservation was at 6:30 pm and didn’t get our plates until 9:48pm and the food was like the drinks, cold.

<text>Customer service is Horrible!
They make your server leave you to celebrate another gusts birthday as if your not important. I'm confused, I reserved my table just like them which makes me just as important!
They don't acknowledge you after you've been seated,  if you get lucky enough. If your not of celebrity status, or know someone there, forget it!
Don't waste your time. It's over hyped, and you'll leave disappointed. Did I mention the food isn't good?
Not trying to salt them, but if your gonna give someone bad service, altleast make sure you have great food!
I was starving!< /text><Resp>{'time': 1620239651030, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review Sugar Factory!

Very nice place. Great atmosphere. The food is "meh", Kevin is a cool waiter. Ordered two drinks and never got them. Manager came and offered us complimentary drinks for the wait, still never got them. Milkshakes are cool, but I've had better. A little on the expensive side not to get awesome service. My kids weren't too pumped and neither was wifey. "Nice, but no seconds.."< /Text>

My bestfriend & I came to Sugar Factory in LA tonight as part of our #BestieTrip and it was a great experience from beginning to end! The vibe & ambiance was great, very upbeat, fun, & lively. They are quite busy so it may take a little longer to be seated but it is well worth the wait because the food & drinks are delicious! We had the sampler platter, the Signature burger meal, & a cotton candy cosmopolitan drink - it all tasted amazing! Well worth the price. Our waitress Tiffany, who was also the manager, was very sweet, accommodating, efficient, & friendly. Would definitely recommend coming here!</text>

<Review>Excellent restaurant for a party for any age group.  The food is delicious (the grilled salmon was exceptional) and their creative drinks are quite impressive!  While the waitstaff is extremely nice, they need to improve their response time with requests.  Hence the 4-star rating.</Review>< username>

<date>1614652420833< /date><Text>After reading some bad reviews I decided to give Sugar Factory a try because my bonus granddaughter wanted to celebrate her 9th birthday there, she has been to the one in San Diego, and wanted to try this location. We arrived for reservation about 5-10 minutes early( 2/28/21 @8pm), and was greeted, by a very pleasant hostess. We were sat within 5 minutes, and the staff even took some pictures for us while we waited. The hostess walked us to a great table  near firepit, which I loved. We were promptly met by our awesome server Jennifer, who asked if we have been before, and took our drink order and made some great suggestions. We were given water right away, and Jennifer shortly returned with my wine. We already knew what we wanted and gave her our order. No joke, we received our food within 5-10 minutes, I was shocked how fast the food came out, my granddaughter ordered Rainbow sliders, and I ordered Chinese chicken salad, and then we got the Tye Dye Milkshake, everything was delicious, and Jennifer came back to check on us several times, she was very attentive. We had a great time, and I honestly had low expectations because of the bad reviews , so I figured we would go for photo op, eat some bad food, and my granddaughter would be happy, well I had a wonderful time from the beginning to the end. Great food, Great Service, and the music will keep you chair dancing. I am planning on bringing my son here for his 18th birthday, and I cannot wait! Looking for an excuse to come back before then:)Thank you Sugar Factory for  giving me and my granddaughter a wonderful experience last night!<//Text><Name>Faye Austin</Name>< gmapID>

The PRICE WAS RIDICULOUS AND UNECESSARY but my server Shawn was so great.  He was attentive and made sure we were comfortable. Leah gave major attitude when she brought my shot in a dirty glass and I asked if I can get it in a clean glass. Antonio and Tom was very kind when we grab them over to our table to ask for something while Shawn was on break.
Now the overall service was a bit annoying because I has to wait 1 hour and 5 minutes to be seated and my reservation was for 4pm .
There was no compensation for the long wait and no apology. They need to work on that IMMEDIATELY<//review>

Everything is everything! There's a reason why Drake, Mariah Carey, Jenn Lopez and a host of other celebs dine here!  Great fun for kids and for adults!!! The place is da bomb!!! The staff - particularly the dynamic, charming, AWESOME so 'real' MARCUS -  is so cordial, so personable, so likable and so authentic! You can tell when you're meeting the real persona and when you're meeting the "gimme a good tip' persona. Marcus is authentically cool! The other team members were also sweet, patient, and professional as well as eager to please, helpful, and knowledgeable. These guys are definitely invested in customer service and quality service to the point that they make you wonder whether they own stock in the Company! Lol Maybe they do.

Sugar Factory's food staples don't disappoint in taste, but it's more about well-crafted, artistic presentation and colorfully stunning 3-D culinary art when it comes to amazing fare that turns heads and makes you feel the uniqueness of eating here!!! The ambiance is special, and the music so ideally compatible with the upbeat positivity and charisma of this dining experience. We kept wanting to order every eye-catching dish and drink that passed our table on a server's platter. The waffles we ordered (kid size order) were good. The eggs were fresh. I am always criticizing eggs served at many establishments I visit on the basis that the dish tastes stale, bland, mass-produced. I really liked the well-prepared eggs served at SF though. The cheeseburger was delectable as was the side salad with arugula onions cucumbers and other very fresh veggies. The drinks...amazing! Order the Diamond Rose! The visual alone wowed me! The elaborate yellow rose wall at reception makes an excellent background for pics btw and many selfie-taking patrons (families, couples, singles alike) take full photo opp advantage of the pretty decor!!! Love this place - Drake, Mariah and I!</text>

We went yesterday for my grandson's birthday. The one in Century city. So overrated! Not clean at all the booths were wet as if they had just been wiped down, but the buttons on the booths had sticky stuff and old cookie crumbs inbeded in them.Food was cold. The 40$ drinks suppose to have 9 shots of liquor in them tasted like a wine cooler. Flooring was sticky  very unclean and with Covid you would think that they cared about being clean.We watched them get ready to sing happy birthday to a table and while they were getting ready the server's were passing around the 100$ ice cream bowl back and  forth to each other  for about 7 minutes before taking it to the table. How unsanitary was that. Bottom line is we all got sick and will never ever return.  It's a shame to spend 658$ for nothing. Very disappointing</Text>

<Text>We really enjoyed our visit on 3/16, the second day of indoor dining at restaurants after the COVID shutdown.  We were a party of 11 with a reservation, here for a birthday.  We probably should have checked in right when we arrived 20 minutes early, but we wandered around and checked in just a few minutes before our reservation, so we waited about 15 minutes to be seated.
The good: two tables, inside, close together.  Very friendly server, Marques made sure we had cameras ready when he poured the smoking drinks.  Good food, especially chicken fettuccine alfredo and club sandwich.  Clean bathrooms.  Great atmosphere.  Loved the chandelier inside and the plants outside.  The music was not so loud that we couldn't talk over it.
The bad: took a while to get our food, but we had plenty to talk about, so no biggie.
More good: although we didn't complain about the time, the manager, Percy came over and thanked us for our patience and comped part of our bill.  And the drinks were fun and creative.  It's like a grown up Farrell's with better food and atmosphere.  But where once was enough with Farrell's, I will definitely come here again.</Text>< Date>

This was my first time ever at a Sugar Factory and it was a terrible experience! The staff here was the most unsatisfactory and completely incompetent I’ve ever experienced at an establishment.
I hate to be so harsh, but it was! It was so bad that everyone on our entire side of this location was complaining!
Here’s an example... one of the outdoor umbrellas fell on top of guests and it was picked back up but never secured and it fell another two times, before a guest next to us picked it up and held it for 10 mins. He finally grabbed someone and said this isn’t my job to hold this, I’m a guest! You let this fall of these people three times and haven’t cared once!
The food we ordered we never got served all of it and at the end when we were done and asked for a check we waited an hour and a half! They were so backed up that there were about 6 others ahead of us who had been there before us still waiting!
To top it off there was someone celebrating a birthday and all the staff was singing happy birthday and servicing one family but NO ONE else on my entire side of the place, we were all heated! I would steer clear of this place, if you value time! This place lacks customer service, such as the hostess who seemed to never want to help ANYONE, but constantly walked around looking cute for everyone and that was it! Terrible place I’m afraid. Save yourself. Don’t come here.</Text>

<Review>Didn’t have our table ready when we arrived even though I made a reservation a month in advance. Had to ask three different servers for an umbrella for the table. Napkins and utensils were very dirty looked like they were never cleaned. As for the environment... the people there that day were very loud with zero manners. A table across from mine a child got up on the table to twerk. Music was loud couldn’t hear myself think. Food was ok not worth the price I wouldn’t come back and I don’t recommend. Don’t eat here don’t waste your time or your money the hostesses are very rude too.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1620239647223, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review Sugar Factory!

When they finally did sit us. They told us that at twelve of us could sit together, but they sat us six at a time and not in close proximity. Where we were seated, the seating was filthy. The hostess who sat us told me that the seating was really clean the stains just wouldn't come out.
This was my first time at this place but I will not be back. Not only was the service faulty from the jump....I bought candy from the candy store and some of it was fresh, some of it not so much!! I won't be back.< /Review>< Resp>

Terrible service!!
I made a reservation a month in advance and it still wasn’t ready when I arrived. The waitress and hostess were very rude. They ran out of drinks, so the alcohol menu is very limited. One of my guest ordered the rainbow mini burgers and they did not provide the rubber ducky, they said they ran out. The heat lamps in our section did not work, so we were freezing most of the time. They messed up on a lot of our order and was giving people things that they did not ask for. Then they told me I would have to pay or buy a dessert for them to sing happy birthday. This location sucks!< /Review>

I went today and it was windy so it was very stressful and they did a great job handling everything. I’m sure that this was super stressful for everyone and even though it was, they had great service. The food was also very good.</Text>

I really wanted to experience this place for my bday but after the reviews im scared, who wants to pay all this money and then get treated that way, this place should be shut down or something, after these reviews. Like is corporate not caring lol?? It's all so similar. The same issues. From what I understand y'all only take care of celebrities and people who seem rich. That's truly sad, hopefully, you'll do better one day.<//Text>

WORST EXPERIENCE IN HISTORY. THE WAITRESS ERICA IS TERRIBLE. ANTONIO WASN'T ANY HELP AFTER HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO HELP. JOE, THE MANAGER, WAS ALSO TERRIBLE. RESERVATIONS WERE AT 630PM, WE DIDN'T GET SEATED UNTIL 8PM. WE DIDN'T GET THE WHOLE TABLES ORDER TOGETHER. WE WERE MISSING SOME FOOD. DIDN'T GET ANY OF OUR BEVERAGES. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT EVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE. AND ANYONE WHO MENTIONS THIS RESTAURANT I WILL LET THEM KNOW NOT TO GO. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.< /review>

OK so we will start at the beginning the sugar factory is absolutely beautiful the scenery is real cute so you can definitely get some dope photos the service from the time we checked in was trash we finally got acknowledge to even be considered to be Seated and yes we did have a reservation we get to the table it was about 20 minutes before anyone came in took our drink order no one brought us water when they did finally bring us water they brought it out with our drinks now while these drinks are really cute they are overly priced I understood for our drinks being adults but the kids drinks were the exact same price with no alcohol so that I didn’t understand but yes it is what it isThe food was mediocre at best it’s not good at all it’s OK but again the place is really cute the drinks are really cute so if that’s what you’re going for for pictures for the gram then OK but to say that the food is quality I can’t say that to say that the service was good I can’t say that either however it was really cute when they came out and did the happy birthday for my daughter they did put on a performance it was really cute overall I would have to read this place a six If I would have to write the food I would say it’s a for the look of the place is a T in the service is a four it was nice but I won’t be going back and I would not recommend it unless you just going to get cute pictures the experience is self is trash< /review>

<review>This was 1st time going here and I was very unhappy with my experience. 1st I made an indoor reservation and got sitter outside in 90 degree weather, the young lady that sitted us ask if I wanted a umbrella I said yes. She disappeared 😕 spoke with a supervisor and got the umbrella. They waiter was very nice once I got 1 placed our order and really didn't take that long for my food but my son food took a long time then when he got his food it was wrong they took it back to fix it and it took another 20-45 minutes to bring him a new one and when they did it was a long brown hair in my sons burger, smfh at this point I was over this experience. Oh did I mention that I didn't get any silverware to eat my food with 🤦🏾‍♀️. I really wanted to go to this place and my hopes were high. I was even thinking about giving my son his birthday dinner there. SO DISAPPOINTING< /review>< pics>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Was super fun. We came here for a birthday on a Monday @7pm.. it was not super packed we got to sit inside & it Is open. They play really good music you can sing along to from the 90s+ . Our server was Thomas and he was awesome & sexy may I add. The drinks were cool I got a Henry moon & needed a extra shot (more sugar than spirits). They have more drinks than food items I think but it's a very good variety...something for everyone.. I got the breakfast burger it was super good but big I had to take it apart to enjoy it ( not a good choice for a date, could get messy. loved the fries! The birthday song & ice cream was a vibe 3 servers came out & did the tic toc dance 💃🏾 🕺🏿. They ice cream was huge it was 6 if us and we did not finish it. They put like 10 different flavors so if you are allergic pls let your server know. Over all.. it was great for 6 ppl with 6 drinks 4 shots it was about $550 & the gratuity was not included so we gave about 25% tip. Will come again.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I went there for the first time for my birthday. They have stains all over the seats and table cloths. I thought that was so strange as I've never seen a restaurant has stains everywhere. Second the staff is just like out of it, bored, tired, slow, apathetic. I don't know. It's just a really weird vibe from the wait staff. You expect in a restaurant this expensive to hire experienced, positive people who are hard-working. It was just a very weird experience. Ok then we go to order and half of their menu they say "oh we don't have that right now." It got to the point where we started saying, "OK WHAT DO YOU HAVE?" lol. Again, weird. Never experienced that at a restaurant before. They might be out of 1 or 2 items but half the menu?! Third, the food was very okay. I didn't taste anything that I thought was wow. The arugula on the avacado toast is very overdressed btw. Little touches they missed-- like didn't like the candle on my birthday cake. Ummm why not? Missed one of the little toppings that comes with the rainbow pancakes. Forgot dry ice in the drink... Honestly, it was a very very disappointing experience. I only gave two stars because the idea of the restaurant is cool and I really want to like it lol. It wasn't horrible, like inedible or anything, just not at all what I'd expect for a restaurant of that caliber.< /review>

<Text>Worst customer service. They price you for EVERYTHING, even a nife to cut a cake for a birthday party. This was my second time here thinking I’ll get better service, same horrible customer service. I don’t recommend this place to anyone, they keep you waiting for too long, short portions of food< /Text><Name>Caresse Beauty Bar< /Name><rate>1< /rate>< Gmap_id>

<text>Loved the food and drinks❣️
Hated the service and long wait. It seems to be short staffed here- we couldn’t even get our drinks early or together (waited 40 min for one drink)
The general manager was great and helpful- still the wait for basic service is way too long 😣</text><Response>None< /Response>< user>

Although their candy store is very extensive, the restaurant is mostly built around their beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. It was a very pricey meal of chicken fingers, sliders, fries, onion rings and two shakes, at $82.00 +/- not including tip.< /text>

< Review>
The menu is a little pricey for what is essentially a kids' dream restaurant, BUT the service is deserving of high remarks. Our server interacted well with our kids and went as far as to show them some of the dances he learned from Tik Tok, which our kids loved.

This was my and our son's first time eating here (my wife and daughter had a lunch date a few weeks prior), and the food was pretty good. I had an Asian-inspired chicken salad (I apologize, I don't remember the name of it) that was not quite as large as the bigger Cheesecake factory salads, but was still a good size and left me feeling full after finishing the entire thing. The kids enjoyed sharing the multi-colored sliders and one of the specialty drinks (sans alcohol), and of course the various assorted candies adorning the huge glass it was served in. My wife had the chicken and waffles, which were also good (not Thumbs Up Diner in Atlanta good, but still pretty good for SoCal).

All in all, if you're looking for a fun family or even date night experience, you could do much worse than The Sugar Factory. The views from the outdoor deck add a nice touch as well. Oh, and the birthday celebrations that the staff puts on are pretty entertaining.

Give this place a try, especially if you have young ones; they'll love it.</Review>

<text>Had to wait 15 mins even after making a reservation.....get a table n they obviously didn't clean the booth (hello covid) n sat in someones alcoholic beverage they spilled previously resulting in the whole backside of my dress being ruined. Didn't see waitress till like 10 mins after being seated and she had to clean the booth herself cuz she couldn't find a busboy. So the rest of the dinner I had to sit on my wet dress that reeked of alcohol.<//text>< time>

<Rating>1<//Rating><pics>None<//pics><Review>I don’t know where to begin with this establishment. From the check-in to the customer service it was a disaster. I had reservations at 330pm. I was advised when I arrived there was no need to wait in line, simply walk to the front desk to check-in. Upon arrival, there’s a line of people who hadn’t been helped and majority had reservations. I was informed to wait in line since previous guests were waiting. No problem right, things like this happens, they’ll get everything under control. Wrong, I wasn’t seated until 4:15pm.

It’s covid and of course every thing is outdoors. It was a very windy day, there was only one heat lamp outside, while i seen 4 inside the restaurant.The server didn’t arrive to the table until another 30mins and this was just to bring water, by the way. She greets us, we advise her we’re here for my friends bday, we order drinks and tried to get over the mishaps of what happened earlier. When we received our drinks (again took forever), my friends drink had to be sent back bc it was in a dirty glass(dirty glass was caught by the waitress, shouldn’t she have noticed the glass prior bringing it to the table) and was watered down. By this time, we’re over it. We ordered food and when the food arrived guess what? On dirty dishes. The fries were cold and the food unseasoned. We then just asked for our food to go and for the check.

The waitress brings our check, literally just hands me the receipt lol. When she returns, i see her and other coworkers with a dessert. I’m like, oh at least they’re going to acknowledge my friends bday. That’s cool. Nope, she drops the receipt to me and they walk by to sing happy birthday to next table.

The food is overpriced and nasty. How could anyone mess up on a Turkey club sandwich. The customer service is horrible. I’d never return to this place and wouldn’t recommend anyone to visit!</Review>< resp>

<Review>Reservation at 2:30. Finally was supposed to be seated after 45 min of supposedly waiting on a seat not in the sun. We got seats in the sun. So unprofessional and not enjoyable at all. Never even got served. Sad situation!!!< /Review>< Pics>

<review>The food was good and the waiter service was good. BUT.. the bathrooms were filthy! The toilet paper was all over the floor, there was no paper towels and there was used face masks around the sink. The outdoor dining area had food on the floor and the dining booth was dirty.</review></record>

< Review>
The day before Valentine's day I decided to make a reservation for the Sugar Factory in Century City. My girl has been dying to go so I was trying to surprise her with a pre v-day dinner. My reservation was for 8:30 and we showed up on time dressed up and ready to have fun. When we checked in I reminded them to sit us next to a heater because my girl is anaemic. The lady responded with an attitude saying we will try our best. I brushed it off and said thank you. She then said they will seat us in 2 mins so we waited patiently while they seated others behind us in line. 15 mins roll by I ask so when will we be seated? she responded in a few mins I said thank you. We patiently waited some more. They then seated 8 other couples behind us. Another 10 mins roll by I ask are we still in the que they then acted like I just didn't ask them a while ago. I waited 10 more mins and they seated others. So I told them cancel my reservation. They said yeah sorry. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone well atleast this location. My girlfriend was horribly disappointed and mad.< /Review>

I just left Sugar Factory LA. I had the worst service by far. I was brought the wrong food. My waiter then told me it would be another 35 to 45mins to remake my food. My lady was already finished with her food so I jusy decided to leave. I was there for a full hour and 45mins. I was so excited to go there. It was my first and last experience. They need more proper training.<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>If I could leave no stars I would I don’t recommend this place to anyone. Drove 45 minutes for nothing. Got there at 9:30 and got seated waited till 10:10. Had no server come to welcome nor offer at least water and I was not willing to wait any longer they close at 10:30. If you cannot handle all the reservations then don’t let people book. It’s disappointing and unpleasant to have been treated like we don’t matter unless we have a birthday celebration. Don’t bother coming here unless you want to wait for 1hr or more to get noticed.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Everything here was amazing! Waiters were on time with greetings and serving. The manager made sure that we were taken care of at all times. We came back twice in one day, so that alone should say a lot! Thanks to Jared for all of the wonderful service and hospitality! Louisville loves it here! #RSPCT</review>

I loved the place however service is very slow. My server had a section with a party size of 20 plus people. We hardly seen her however she was polite. My second round of drinks took 45 mins to be brought out which was frustrating along with another 45 for our check . My food was delicious and so was my drink however my first choices I was told were not in stock. My next pet peeve was the umbrellas falling over multiple time. My particular umbrella had no sand bags or weights and spilled my drink which was never replaced due to my server never coming around. For $39 bucks thats very expensive to have spilled on my table due to my umbrella falling on it . I was not able to speak to a manager because no one came to check on us or offer help until after our meals and drinks were finished. I was livid and just wanted to leave. The tables cleanliness was also questionable and  the bathrooms were just plane nasty. No seat covers or toilet paper made me feel disgusted. I have a long list of complaints  from here that should be compensated but the lack of service got the best of my mood to where I wanted to just leave. Overall the actual place and concept is nice. Food was delicious but do not be in a rush service is slower than snail mail , and poor customer service.<//Text>

< review>
The food was spectacular, but the patio was so dirty. Our table was stained, the glasses were made of plastic so they looked dirty. There was glass under our table oh, and the floor didn't look like it had been cleaned in a while. I'm not comfortable going back there until it's cleaned. Also, service was horrible. We didn't get our drinks until our food came out, and our waitress seems like she wasn't trained well. Very unprofessional and made a lot of strange comments.< /review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Definitely not for me. Overpriced,  oversized alcohol and desserts, combined with bad food just doesn't work, no matter how much candy you sprinkle on it.

On top of all that, non-accomodating and blatant lying management capped off a once highly-anticipated birthday celebration for my child.< /text>< Pictures>

If it’s your Birthday you’ll be better off going to McDonald’s!!! They’ll service you better going through drive-thru them waiting 35-45 mins after your reservation time to be seated !! And that’s a big IF!!! I had a party of 9 and only 6 were seated !!! While the others waited for the table next to us get cleaned!! Which never did !!  Orders were WRONG and Food was cold ! Drinks came after the food and they wasn’t even the correct drinks !! It was the only drinks they had available that was brought out ! I’ve never had a restaurant give me a take It or leave it
Option before !!!! Then the table received more of the drink then in the actual cup !!! She kept spilling it while trying to pour it in the cup !! Literally had to ask for utensils after the food was brought out !!!! Spoke to 2 different managers which still did nothing to give us a better Sugar Factory experience !!! I definitely should of stuck to going to BARTON G!!!< /review>

< Review>
Terrible experience today! Party of 4
Food arrived prior to drinks we informed waitress which admitted to error in ordering from Bar
45 minutes later still no drinks. I asked to speak to manager not only waited another 20min she approached our table with attitude said You asked for a Manager? Never introduced herself or apologized for error seemed bothered to speak to us. After another 20-25 minutes she brought the drinks to our table didn’t speak just set them down and acted like we were a burden.
When we were finally able to get a waitress attention to ask for the bill we had to wait another 20 minutes and no one returned I had to walk in and try to find someone to help process our payment.
At this point there are other 3-4 tables of people complaining about not getting their food or bill.
Poor Management........
Poor customer service
First and last time we will ever attend this place.
Ruined our first outside dining since quarantine 😡
If you don’t change your management you will continue to lose customers.<//Review>

I visited to celebrate my birthday. After my friend went above and beyond to get the reservation we arrived about 15 mins before it was time. Still had to wait an additional 20 mins but it was fine being that that gave us time to shop at the store and take pictures. As we were waiting all of the staff were very friendly and polite. I can not lie this place IS a whole vibe. We were seated and that's when the real issues came, it was like the server did not want to serve us (a small party of TWO!) easy money you would think. All of the other servers were interacting with their customers,  and checking on them. He came to the table 3 times, to take the order, to bring the check, and to bring the cards back! I was so mad because this was supposed to be a fun experience FOR MY BIRTHDAY!! I told him that when the other guy brought out the food 20 mins prior I asked for mustard, when he brought the cards back do you think he brought some or ask if I still needed it which was a given because I had only touched 1 of my 5 sliders. NO! I feel like had we had a different server things would have been so different. The food and drinks were really good though. Just make sure you have an awesome server and everything will be cool.<//text>

My first Experience was terrible, I made reservations for my best friends birthday who came out of state to celebrate. When finally being sat we ordered cocktail drinks which took an hour and 15 minutes to arrive. 30 minutes after ordering our drinks we decided to order our food. To follow up the food came out before our drinks, and when it came out it was lukewarm and not to expectations. Then our drinks arrived after a long period of time.My overall satisfaction was a Negative. But the server and manager on duty was nice. But I will not recommend or dine in again.</Text>

I visited this place, it was only outdoor seating, but still nice. I've been the Sugar Factory in Orlando and had a really good time. We didn't get the full experience because of Covid. Next time I'm in town I will definitely return on a Friday or Saturday night. Only complaint is that the service wasn't as good,  a little slow. I assume due to Covid, they may be only requiring minimal staff?< /text>

Might as well use all this free time to do something productive while waiting for a server, such as like warn others to avoid this restaurant. If you're just coming for a dessert, it may be worthwhile. For food though, it took 25 minutes to get a water, 1 hour to get food, and still waiting (15 minutes+) for a box and the check.

As others mentioned, the food was mediocre. My burger was overcooked, but didn't matter too much since the novelty items they put on it overpowered the taste of the meat anyway. What won't have me come back is the terrible service. For instance, I had to ask two different people over a 15 minute period just for a spoon. Definitely not worth the high price.<//review>

Horrible customer service this host was rude I had made reservations for my birthday which was on September 25 for 3;00 pm we were not seated until 4:15. I had another guest coming and she swore she couldn’t have me wait for my guest , so she still seated us in a horrible area sun is burning us up . We never got a menu , no one never came to ask us if we wanted something to drink , or anything no waiter ever came, now it’s 5:05 I literally had to go inside and ask why no one ever attended to us . That finally came and took our order , by that time I was already fed up and ready to go I didn’t even eat all my food had asked them for a too go box , which they forgot to bring , instead they bring me out my cake wish me a happy birthday with a dance that was nice , however they threw my food away . I didn’t want to ruin my day by cussing them out and demanding they give me another plate I just left . I’m big on customer service and your workers lack that , ok . Horrible experience I’ve ever in life had .</text>

<Text>Worst experience. We came to celebrate my mother’s bday. And waited on our table 45min no one approached us. Went up to the serve 3 times to ask for someone to come by and nothing. Finally got fed up and left as we are walking out the server had the audacity to say oh well bye. Instead of apologizing for the inconvenience and for ruining my mother’s evening.

<review>Well lets just say my experience was terrible, I read reviews about this place and I decided to still give it a chance. I visited Sugarfactory yesterday night and the service was terrible, the employees were rude, they were understaffed, and it was pretty bad. If it werent for the manger on Duty Lamar, I probably wouldve left and said forget it but he did his best to insure we left somewhat happy. The food is great and so are the drinks, its just hard to get your order in a timely matter which makes people upset. It takes 30 minutes to get a glass of water, another 30 minutes to get your drink, its bad. Our reservation was at 10pm, we didnt get our food until around 1130pm. I am not recomending this place to any of my friends or family memebers.< /review>< Pictures>

HORRIBLE!!! Waited an hour outside our reservation! Certain Staff members were rude and VERY unprofessional. Very overpriced for the service! Wouldn’t recommend it was a waste of time. Sticky floors, broken chairs, staff NOT wearing a mask, dirty chair cushions, and chairs WITHOUT cushions. The hostess said “she only works on the weekends and she doesn’t like her job.” Allowing other customers to play their personal music. However, Steven was a very professional and nice waiter.<//Text>

Flew in from Dallas, Texas to visit this place. What a WASTE‼️ Seemed nobody knew what was going on. Had reservations for 9, got seated close to 9:30, after the hostess seated other people who showed up after us (with no reservation)  it took us nearly 20 minutes after being seated for a waitress to even come to our table, to get our drink order.
Service at this place was the WORST!! Especially for the prices. I regret visiting this location and wish I would have chosen a better establishment for my wife’s birthday celebration.</text>

<name>ajamz mom</name><Review>Loved it, the food was so good. We had the sampler that came with buffalo wings, chicken fingers,onion rings, mac and cheese pop. I has the Steak flatbread pizza. So good, steak, mushrooms and more on a crisp flatbread. We were celebrating a birthday, they have a DJ play a song of your choice. They come and sing at your table, we got the half size dessert feed 6. It's filled with ice cream, candies, gummys, caramelized bananas, and a lot more. We had a blast, our server Ryan was awsome. You can browse their store while you wait for your table on thier patio. The store has ice cream, candy, gummies, lots of cool merchandise. We plan to go again for the next person celebrating a birthday.<//Review>< Response>

I ordered the Macaroni burger it came Luke warm. The music was so loud that we couldn't here each other. The food was just OK. The milk shake was good. Our waiter was decent. For what they charge for a hambuger they really need to work on it. The chicken sandwich looked like it came from a lunch cafe restaurant and it was just ok.<//Review>

<Review>Never again😭they took so long to attend us, the seating area was dirty, & the food isn’t all that & expensive for no reason. If you do go i recommend to just get their $40 alcoholic beverage that was the only thing that was worth it.</Review>< Time>

Horrible horrible horrible service. No point in making a reservation here. Had a reservation at 3:30, wasn't seated until 5. Had to keep asking how much longer for my party of TWO. They kept telling me only a few more minutes then they disappeared. While waiting there to be seated I could see that this is a very common problem they have. A lot of people waiting there with us that had a reservation earlier in the day.< /Review>

Slowwww service. We had reservations at 6pm, didn't get drink orders until 6:20pm (we only ordered water) and didn't our food until an hour later. Plus an additional 15+ minutes to get to-go boxes and the check. I also ordered a non-alcoholic "Virginia Strawberry Lemonade" that never came. The food was mediocre. I ordered soup and it came without a spoon. We had to ask 2 different people for a spoon only to be forgotten or ignored.

If you go for their desserts and alcohol, it might be worth while but only because it's "Instagrammable." Otherwise, it's not worth the high price.

Also, I wish they're stricter on their face mask requirements. There was a big party near us that kept walking all over the patio without masks.< /text>

This was my very first time eating at this restaurant. We waited for over an hour. When our food finally arrived we did not get our appetizers we ordered. They did not provide any silverware with our meal. The drinks were watery and our waitress did not provide napkins. We had to wait for 30 min to get anyone’s attention to inform them to bring silverware. First impressions are everything and this was not a pleasant experience. The waitress’s dress was so short and not professional attire because when she bent over you could see her derrière. Also the cups the water was brought in were dirty. The manager on duty NEVER came to our table to address our issues. She said she would come over but never came back<//text>

Our reservation was for 9:30pm and we were seated at 10:15pm. There were open tables and no one else waiting so I’m not sure what took so long. After being seated our host didn’t arrive to our table until 20 mins later. The waiter Shawn was not friendly and I’m guessing since it was the end of the day maybe he was tired, IDK. We ordered our drinks and food to avoid additional wait times. The food and drinks arrived at a decent time but we had no silverware or straws. When asked for silverware the hosts stated that they were on their way. My niece got up and grabbed her own silverware and walked to the bar for straws. The food was delicious but because the service was sooooo horrible I would never go back to this location. Must I also add that we drive 25 mins to see what the hype was about. Never again!!!!!!!!!<//Text>

<text>Food: The chicken alfredo is tasty and it was a  big portion. Experience: cute for photos and candy but they’re not doing a good job with service. They move really slow, aren’t proactively cleaning as well as they could, and oblivious to the lack of social distancing. This restaurant has all the bells and whistles but at its core it’s a subpar experience.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

First of all, it’s hard to find because it’s located in a mall.  Could not enjoy the full experience because “you need a reservation”  customer service is ok but can definitely improve.< /Review>

We were a party of 6 and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation The service was horrible. The food was brought out and sever piece by piece.
Can’t believe a restaurant like this would provide such bad service. Will never go back again!< /Text>

I love Bank of America. Fernando Gonzalez is the best relationship banker. The way he deals with his customers is superb. He is very helpful and friendly. We recommend Bank of America to all for their best services and special thanks to Fernando Gonzalez. If it possible I want to give more than 5 stars<//Review>

The wait is about 1 hour.  You have to stand outside in the heat. There is a separate line for ATM. Bring your mask, umbrella and chair. All the other BofA banks are closed. The staff is friendly and they even brought us water. Be patient, smile, and bring your husband to talk. He went and got me Pupusas and we finally made it inside the Bank. Be positive, life is good.< /Review>

<review>Thought it was pretty rude to have an employee come up to me and ask how much I had in my bank account. Pretty common question to ask, I guess. Felt embarrassed that I had to answer that question. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Probably won't return to this location.
I can't even say I'm rich in happiness. Thank you for reminding me how bad life really is.</review></record>

<name>King Kern</name><review>I have been a customer for over 30 years, I go there almost every week. They offer convenient locations and have superior customer service.  The Staff is always friendly and helpful at this specific location. I’d like to give a special shoutout to Lupe Serrata for giving me a thorough walk through of the mobile app and helping me finally realize how fast and safe it is. Thank you sir! This is going to save me a lot of trips to the bank.

The employee working named Daisy came out, made her way infront of me very rudely to use the atm before me, even though there is a long line. Then has the audacity to tell me I’m not standing in line and I need to go else where. I asked for her name and she hid her name tag. So I called to complain and she answered the phone asking what I wanted. I asked to speak to her boss and she would not answer me just kept rudely asking me what I want. She needs to be fired in my opinion. I have done many business transactions with this location and I always get bad attitude from the same person. Why I have no idea.

Nasty staff...we have been escorted out just because me and my wife entered from exit door (mistakenly/unaware) at 4 o clock. Problem is the way they treated us and escorted out was horrible, they were treating us as if we are there to rob that bank. Matter of fact,we were there to deposit money in BOA and we are there because our regular branch is closed due to covid impact. Now while in parking my wife ran and went inside before 4 o clk ( wrong door/Exit door) and I step in later and already there was a huge queue, seems like their poor services. Very nasty speaking girl escorted us out with blaming wrongly entering via exit door,very bad experience with BOA location first time in my life. Never going again to this location< /Text>

HORRIBLE. Such slow service. They have 20 booths, but only 2 open. Wait in line for 2 hours in 105 degree weather before entering. Absolutely horrible. Management should definitely triple the number of booths open at the very least.</Review>

<review>Thank you Thomas and Sami. They were really great. I had some payment issues with the bank, they went above and beyond for several hours just to make sure we leave with the vehicle back home which is 3 hours away. I really appreciate their help and understanding. Definitely recommend coming to ZAS motors with their outstanding customer service and being awesome humans.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I had a really good experience at ZAS Motors. Thomas and Maria were very helpful and truly made us have a great experience. The whole staff helped us out and made us feel very comfortable. We would definitely purchase another car from them and highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a used car! 10/10! Definitely go and check out the variety of cars they have!<//Text>

Bring a mechanic with you before you buy here. Double check the warranty. I got sold a lemon. Nothing but problems with my vehicle. They are very nice on the other hand. I just don’t think they checked my vehicle very well.</Review>

I had a great experience with Zas Motors.  Sami and Thomas were a pleasure to deal with.  After talking to Sami & Thomas a couple pf times I drove almost 3 hours to see the car I found on their website.  They were very honest, friendly, and didn't pressure me at all.  I took the car for a test drive and decided to buy it on the spot.  I would highly recommend Zas Motors to anyone who is looking for a place that understands the meaning of the word Customer Service.</Review>

I have never bought a used car before so this was my first experience and it was beyond my expectations.  I was allowed to take the car to my mechanic for an inspection and there were a few issues that were addressed to my satisfaction.  They had another offer on the car, but allowed me to make up my mind first.   They were polite and there was no pressure.  I am extremely happy with my decision to buy my car from Zas and Thomas is the best.  Highly recommend them!!!<//review>

<Text>Had to come back and change my review as unfortunately I was sold a lemon by this company, In march I had purchased a 2015 wrx base from this company with a 4 month 4 thousand mile warranty. Not 100 miles into ownership the throw out bearing goes out in the clutch, which destroyed the clutch plate and assembly. This ended up costing me $600 out of pocket and I struggled to get the manager to help me cover repairs of which only parts were covered in the end as according to him this happened due to my inexperience and the warranty I had been told would help with these repairs would actually not.(Been driving manual over 10 years at this time and have not had a clutch go up to this point). Not long after the front wheel hub assembly went out and is now costing me an additional $500 in repairs on top of the $600 I paid for the clutch and the $600 I paid for new tires that were bald when the car was dropped off to me. As these issues were experienced so suddenly in my ownership of the vehicle its hard to believe that the claim that it was sold in good faith to me after 150 inspection is accurate...major dissapointment.

For a vehicle I have not put 2000 miles on or had a chance to have fun with this was extremely beguiling to me. What was genuine excitment over a new to me vehicle, was quickly soured thanks to the lack of supportby Zas motorsports. I would never buy anything more expensive then a lawnmower from them unless you are prepared to spend a grip of extra money. A genuine group of scammers.< /Text>< response>
{'time': 1622752534033, 'text': "Jeremy,\nThank you for your review and comments on here, this is your personal opinion of our company and we value that.\nI have talked to over the phone for several time, offered you any help possible, we paid you for your clutch which is something can go bad within miles if you don't know how to engage it right, that is why most of warranty companies does not cover Clutches, because someone can burn the clutch in a day. The warranty we gave you was a complimentary warranty for 4 months 4000 miles, it was free of charge, it only covers power train, which is Major parts on the car not your maintenance parts.\n\nThank you for helping and supporting a small business in your community by being so supportive and helpful. We wish you all the best with your car which is a great car with a great value."}< /response>

Many people know how stressful it is buying a vehicle and that you always have to be on alert when dealing with car salesman but Thomas made my car buying experience very easy. I was greeted at the door generously and got a great deal on a car for my wife. I highly recommend zas motors<//text>

<review>I just want to share what a fantastic experience I had buying my Honda civic from Zas motors. Tomas and Zamir are great guys there was no pressure to buy and any issues I found with the car was immediately taken care of.They offer a great warranty also for a fair price. I have had the car a week and no issues , I would definitely recommend them to anyone who seeks a quality used vehicle.Keep up the excellent work you guys and thanks again .</review></record>

I literately called and made an offer on a car and was told I’d be called back in two hours in order to start the process. I already had the money, the car picked out, and insurance. The woman NEVER called me back. I’m baffled. What a terrible, terrible company. I’m glad I didn’t waste $7000 with them.<//Text>

Since then I’ve been modifying my car and making it unique to me but I couldn’t have done it without the amazing team at ZAS for offering me a great deal and being honest salesmen.
Being the first car I’ve purchased, I was very nervous that I might get scammed or tricked into buying a car which had issues, but this was not the case.
Out of all the dealerships I visited, ZAS Motors was the most friendly, trusting, and honest. I felt no pressure at all while I was there.
I will continue recommending ZAS to anyone looking to buy a car.
Thank you!

During the purchase Thomas was willing to work a deal with me I couldn’t refuse. Really excited about my purchase and will be recommending more people to Zas dealship for sure. Thanks again 🤟🏻🙏.<//text>

< Review>
I came to this place in search of my first car,  best decision I made. Masir was very kind and reasoning with me. I don’t have the best credit, so when he went to try and find someone who would finance me, we didn’t have much luck when trying to find the best deal for both of us. I initially wanted to put down as much of a deposit as I could so I could have a lower monthly payment. But the way my credit is set up it wasn’t working out(lol). So when he decided to take a chance & finance me his self I couldn’t believe it. He offered me 0% APR, yes my monthly payment was a bit higher then I wanted but it was the best decision I EVER made. I knocked out all my payments in SEVEN months!! And now I OWN my car. Thanks guys!  Definitely recommend going here & checking them out. Will definitely return as a customer when the time comes.</Review>

<Text>Went looking for a used Ford Focus. Marcus was very helpful and showed me what he had and what would soon be available. Decided after looking at the lot that I would not look elsewhere, I could find a good deal here. The second day I went in they had a Lexus sitting on the lot that was not there before. After driving it, decided this was the car. They accepted my offer (below their list) and I went home happy. Within the first three days my driver window stopped working and the battery died!! But wait, No Problem!! They fixed/replaced both!! Happy with the car, the service, and
the people.<//Text>< user>

Ak, I really appreciate you going the extra mike to get me off the lot with a new car. For someone who has no credit and is young, you really went of your way to make sure I got the car I wanted. If you're a first time buyer, I highly recommend you give Zas a try, they make the impossible possible</review>

After buying my car from them my oil change light came on and tire pressure low light was on I had brought it back because they told me their employee didnt reset it right and he reset it 3 different times again because they insured me it had an oil change after being fed up with them not fixing the problem I took it in to get the oil changed on it and found out they had lied about doing the oil change on my vehicle and my tire had a screw in it<//review>

The best car buying experience I have ever had with a used car dealer, Zamir the Owner is very honest and respectful person he helped me out through all the process and made the buying process easy and fun. He gave the best deal that I wanted. I will for sure try them in my future car needs and will recommend them to others. Thanks ZAS Motors< /review>

<review>I bought a 2009 Toyota Corolla from Zas back in September 2017. Well it's been about 4 months and 4,000 miles. I am very pleased with my car and the price I paid for it. I was very glad to find Zas because the car I got was less than the lowest priced cars you can find at a franchised dealership, but it's a great car and in great condition. And I was not pressured - I found the car I wanted online and was never pushed to get a more expensive one. In fact, I was paying about 15% of the car myself, and using a loan for the rest - and they actually forgot to collect the payment from me when I drove it off the lot. If they were only about making tons of money off of every sale, I think they would have remembered that part! My only 'complaint' is that they forgot to reset the maintenance light when the did the oil change. I had to google how to do it myself, took 10 minutes total.<//review>< Response>

I am blown away by the service i've gotten at Zas motors, esp from AK.

I bought the car, had issues with finance company, due to my credit, wanting more info, even though id already taken the car home. This made me feel car was not yet mine. Zas agreed it was an inconvenience and offered me a free oil change & detail at a time of my choosing, what? Yep cool move by them, and totally unexpected!

Furthermore when i realized the front right tire had a very slow leak, they had me come in and put a new tire on, without me having to ask.

When i bought the car there was a slight issue with sunroof nor opening properly. They assured me i could make an appt at a date of my choosing and they'd fix it. When i came into get the new tire, they fixed the sunroof as well. I'm now rolling in my new hybrid and couldn't be happier.

Car drives amazing, they worked hard to get me financing at best rate they could, and have already shown a dedication to excellent customer service, as stated above.

We've all got our horror stories, from buying used cars, this has been the polar opposite. Its a great feeling to know, there are honest used car salesman out there. So if looking for a good, fair deal, from an honest company, look no further than Zas motors.

And on top of all this they are really nice guys! I'll recommend anyone i know to these guys, without reservation. Thankyou AK & Zas motors!<//text>

HAVE YOUR CAR CHECKED!!!!!
I bought a car from this place about a month ago and regret it. The only positive aspect was the one salesman that was friendly. The vehicle I wanted had a couple dings and bruises but nothing I couldn't get fixed myself. After turning the vehicle into a licensed technician to do an alignment I found out and seen for myself that the after removing a couple things there was over $2000 of work that it needed. The Technician then deemed the vehicle unsafe to drive. *For future buyers* Take you vehicle straight to a qualified technician for all checks before buying from this establishment! Don't take their word for it.<//Text>

Zas Motors is one of the very few exceptional used car dealers in the San Diego area. I know because I went to at least 10 different used car dealers before purchasing my car from them. This was my first time purchasing a used vehicle ever in my life and I can honestly say Zas Motors not only met all of my criteria but exceeded my expectations. Zas Motors is honest, hard working, fair, and the most genuine people I have been able to find in the business.
The vehicle I purchased from them is the exact vehicle I have scoured the internet and local areas in search of for the last 4 months. I took the vehicle to Midas for a pre-purchase inspection and the car came back with a great report. Midas only recommended changing the brake rotor on one of the front wheels due to normal wear over time. After showing Masir, of Zas Motors, Midas’ report, Masir replaced the brake rotors and brake pads on both front tires free of charge. They also stayed true to their original deal of the price of the vehicle that was negotiated the day prior, and let me just say that I negotiated a great deal. Truly stand up dealers. The vehicle has proven to be reliable, economic and of great value.
This was one of the best purchasing experiences I’ve had and I feel as though I made some friends in the process. Ask them where they are from and let them tell you a little about their history. You won’t regret it and it will make your car buying experience that much more enjoyable. These guys have literally risked their lives to be where they are at today, saving US American’s lives in the process.
Coming to a fair agreement on a vehicle you’re interested in purchasing from Zas Motors will not only leave you satisfied as a customer but will leave you feeling appreciative of their business, respecting of their commitment to their customers, and genuinely happy to see people who have risked so much, deserving of so much more, make a fair and honest living for a chance at a better life here in San Diego.

<review>Wow!!!!!Honesty, Great Customer service and great deal !

It was incredibly a great experience purchasing a car from this dealership. Zamir Sultani is a great and a professional salesman I have ever met. He is very friendly and take care of his customers very well.  He treats customers with smile and explain everything clearly about the cars, price and paperwork. Overall, they know how to do business and make customers happy by offering great deals. Their price is really good comparing to other dealers in the market. I purchased a nice car from them and I got a great deal with a saving of at least $700 plus  great quality. I visited several car dealerships in San Diego, but I couldn't find such a good deal with nice a car.  I recommend this dealership for anybody who is looking for a reliable car and great experience. Thank Ms. Zamir, I hope you go very far in your business.<//review><user_name>Lutfullah Saadet</user_name>< rating>

<Review>It's been about a year since I bought a Honda Fit for my fiancé (now wife) and we love it ! Zamir was gracious kind and worked with us every step of the way. He came off as a very family oriented man and was honest with us from the get go about prices , about the benefits and good things about different cars and about the bad things. We didn't buy a brand new car. But for the price I feel like I did. They provided all the details about the work on the car and when we got it everybody was amazed at the quality and the great deal we got. I held off for a long time on giving a review and I hope this doesn't sound fake it's just I had a negative experience buying a car before but with zamir I had a great experience and we love the car and the price we got ! So keep it up!<//Review>< pics>

<text>I normally don't review car dealerships but I felt this one was necessary.

Let me start off by saying that my overall personal interaction with the salesperson working was pleasant, not pushy, and relatively transparent.

I feel the salesman wasn't familiar with Jeep's which I can understand, it's hard to know every car make and model front to back, so I don't discredit his efforts. He was generally very nice and pleasant.

My complaint with this company is they're selling this particular 10+ year old Jeep Wrangler Sahara for  $4k-$6k more than the blue book priced value.

The other issues above this ^ are as follows:

Upon inspecting the vehicle, the appearance is polished which I can tell they made this car appealing to the buyer. However, it quickly became a smoke and mirror situation.

Popped the hood and the radiator cap was missing.
Red flag.
The back seats were also removed from this vehicle, which the salesperson did offer to go to the Junk yard and find some for me.

The car sounded like it was idling ok.
The aftermarket off-roading tires were at 40% tread which for me, would be an additional $600+ to replace them, you cannot just buy 2 tires on a 4-wheeling vehicle. Another expense.

The car seems to ride ok, whoever had it before made the differential much More dramatic for crawling, so the steering was extremely loose even on city roads.

Took this baby on the freeway to see how she did, I had to flinstone my foot to the ground to even get it to go above 60mph, took time and effort. Then the entire car began shaking tremendously, it felt like it was going to fall apart. Yes, that's an exaggeration but it was pretty bad.

The car then coming to a stop, I had to slam all my energy into the breaks to get it to stop, meaning the breaks had a malfunction or have not been refreshed for resale.

After this scary test drive, I then drop it off at the lot where I went to roll up the driver side window. Which, would to my surprise not roll up.

The lot assistant said he informed his tech guy and that there's a way to get it up but it's a sweet spot.
I drove by this morning, that window is still down (I live a few blocks away).

The reason why I'm going into detail is because Had I not known what to look for, I may have purchased what appeared to be a cool great car, and then been  stuck with a 10 year old car that needs constant upgrades and repairs.

This car also says " CLEAN TITLE" but when you review the car auto report it has had structural damage twice which means, no! It's likely a salvaged title.

To anyone who is young or inexperienced with purchasing cars. Please take someone with you who can look out for these things, I've made this mistake as a kid and don't want someone to be sold a car that's not worth it's value like this. Good luck.</text><user_id>105136467200442375755<//user_id>< rate>

<rating>5</rating><text>I finally got around to trying this place after living down the street for a couple years. I just had some of the best carne asada I've ever had, in SD or Mexico. My Mexican wife said the lengua is some of the best she had ever had (I even liked it and normally don't)!

I only wish that I had realized 2 years ago I didn't need to drive across town for a decent burrito.< /text>< pics>

<review>Their roll tacos are good but they don’t accept any type of payment but cash that is kind of of a big inconvenience and then the lady they want you to pull cash from their ATM which charges you $4.</review>< Pictures>

<review>My wife and I wanted a quick bite before we headed to SD. We popped in here and got a quesadilla with guacamole.  My wife was skeptical become it came out so fast, she was scared it wasn’t going to be cooked through. We opened the package and  it was hot and had the perfect amount of grill marks on the tortilla. The guacamole was good with chunks of tomatoes. We both loved the quesadilla and my wife said it was the best she ever had. Next time we leave the Wild Animal Park, we will be stopping by.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

And everyday it is the same price
No meat sub meat for egg
Today however I got charged a dollar more
So if you add it up
My $2 atm fee (oh yes I forgot cash only but there is an atm you can use for $2)
$1 extra today
$6 burrito
I just got ripped off for bad service for mediocre sub-par food.

This is a fairly sized taco shop, with a standard menu of items. Prices are pretty fair, although it is cash only. Service was alright, nothing special.

I decided on the breakfast burrito, which contains eggs, potato, rice, beans, cheese and bacon or ham. I was pretty disappointed by this burrito, it was very dry and the eggs were pretty overcooked. Their red salsa was also lacking in flavor and spice to say the least.

Overall, this place just has low average food, but it's not somewhere I would want to revisit.</text>

I love this place the food is amazing! Been going there for many years. My whole family loves eating there every time we visit Escondido. My favorite food are the rolled tacos with rice and beans,  but I like everything there! Their beans are really good. The staff are very friendly as well!< /review>

Been going to this restaurant for over a year, and service has always been amazing! Very delicious food with generous portions at an affordable price. My favorite dishes from them are the carne asada fries, the roll tacos, the fish tacos, the carnitas tacos, and the quesadilla supreme. Their beans are great too! I often order my food over the phone and the staff has always been very helpful and prompt. Clean and well stocked restrooms.< /text>

<Review>Loved my adobado plate with corn tortillas! The meat was juicy and spicy, they braised it just right, so the meat didn't dry out, and i loved the slightly sour chile flavor. The beans with cheese were also sooooo good, only a small portion, I wished for more, but I had ordered to go! I definitely recommend. The place was packed and there was a line out the door for to-go orders, so people know it's good!!</Review>< pics>

This is my favorite taco shop. It's run by a family made up of the nicest people around and their food is made fast and is delicious. I'm obsessed with their red sauce. Went to the high school nearby so this place was the best place to go, even though it isn't as close as the mall's food court.< /Text>

Service is terrible, anytime we go there we are waiting too long for food. Not very authentic, they use the same sauce for their mole, enchiladas, and chilaquiles. They have no competition in the area so their standards are sub par.< /Text>

<review>This place is super convenient to my house so when I've craved a burrito or carne asada quesadilla and don't want to drive more than 5 mins, Chito's got the job done.  I usually order over the phone, but found myself ordering from the register today.  I looked at the menu and ordered the quesadilla supreme with carne asada (pick looked like the carne asada quesadilla I typically ask for on the phone).  Have to add guacamole to it (weird for a "supreme"), and it comes out to like $9 (steep), but it's what I'm in the mood for.  When my food comes out, it's filled with beans, which is not my thing at all.  I look at the menu and there's no mention of beans (wouldn't even think to ask on a quesadilla), and ask for them to remake it without.  No dice.  I'll need to buy another $9 quesadilla.  I say that I've been coming for years and I will absolutely never come back out of principle.  Woman at the register didn't flinch at all.  A second woman said that she would grab her boss, but after waiting around for a bit, it was clear no one was interested in making it right.  I forgave their "cash only" stubbornness for a while, but I'm officially done.< /review>< Pics>

Store looks  Like is belongs in Mexico. No salsa bar. Bathrooms are cleaner then the kitchen. Food takes forever? Kitchen staff all joking and having a good time, but ive been waiting for a California burrito for $15 min. Burrito is ok .

We visited Tapioca Express after seeing many great reviews. Those must have all been written by friends of the employees or store owner.  First, if I was the owner and my bathroom was as dirty and gross as this stores, I'd be so embarrassed and definitely fire whom ever was supposed to be cleaning it. The bathroom should have been my first clue. The drinks are average but as a customer every little thing you do to your drink adds 75 cents. The employees who make the drinks are slow,  and do not follow proper sanitation between making different drinks in addition to making drinks and taking orders. So grossed out.< /text>

<Review>Tapioca Express is my favorite drink (YogurtFrost) destination. Where they greet you by name upon entering the establishment. Mat and his crew have really got the hospitality thing down!! You havnt lived until you been to Tap Ex of Westminster(Brookhurst and Bolsa).</Review>< user_id>

One of the best Boba places in Little Saigon, with very large menu options good service and reliable drinks quality. My favorite is the durian smoothie with boba and lychee jelly. Snack food are also available for those who want to hang out and drink/eat on the spot.< /text>

<review>Some covid precautions were still in place, as they should be.  Didn't have to wait.  Dr. Domotor gave Junie a thorough yearly exam and explained important points to me.  I've been going to this vet for 26 years and wouldn't think of letting anyone else care for my cats.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I have taken my pets to Dr. Domotor for over 30 years.  I am continually  impressed by the knowledge and customer focus of the vets and the staff.  They all seem to truly care about the health of my pets.  Over the years, a few of our pets have had serious problems (e.g., swallowing something that obstruct their stomachs).  The team at Dr. Domotor's Animal House treated these problems with skill and expertise.  I know my pets are in good hands at the Animal House.<//review>

My 2 dogs are boarded quite frequently when I travel.  They are always happy to go with the tech into the facility and are happy dogs when I pick them up.  My dogs also get all of their care with Dr. Byrnes and she is kind and loving with them.  I highly recommend this veterinary facility for all of your pet needs.< /review>

I have taken all of my pets to Dr. Domotor since I moved to Monrovia more than 25 years ago, and recommend her to anyone who asks.  They are caring, professional, and trustworthy.  I wouldn't trust my pets to go anywhere else!  Highly recommend them!!!</Text>

Everyone is very patient and listens to all of your concerns. They are so sweet and kind to my Bella and they didn’t force me to buy any extra products like most vets have done to me. This will definitely be the regular hospital I bring my dog to. Also the prices were very fair, cost less than all other vets I have taken my dogs to.</review><name>cctime7<//name>< rating>

Dr. Domotor and Dr. Byrne have been so patient and caring for our very sick puppy when no other Vet would accept him during pandemic because he was a new patient.  He has been thriving and doing well under their care.  They are always flexible and nurturing to our Ollie.<//review>

Horrible customer service! They make you wait in the parking lot, some tech in ripped pants tries to come grab your dog, and the doctor won’t talk to you or see you! I Don’t recommend at all! Super sketchy!<//Review>

I have been taking my animals to Dr. Domotor since moving to Monrovia in 1987. I followed her to her own practice when it opened because I couldn't imagine taking my pets to anyone else. She and her fellow vets and staff are kind, caring and gentle. I always feel like they treat my pet as if it were their own. I wouldn't go to anyone else for my vet needs!</Text>

<review>Dr. Domotor has been our vet for over 25 years.  She's the best doctor around.
As always Dr. Domotor goes above and beyond when it comes to caring for my dogs.  I recently made an appointment for one of my dogs who was sick.  I sent an email to the office in advance of the appointment to let them know what was going on with him.  After reading it, Dr. Domotor had me bring him in the same day.  Thankfully she did that because he was sicker than I realized.  He's doing better now and I am truly grateful.<//review>< pictures>

This Dr makes you feel calm he is very good with your pet and when you call and leave a message for him he returns your call pretty fast and is willing to offer up help with any concerns you may have   .I would recommend him even though it seems like alot to pay but it's worth it . Plus he's way cheaper then other Dr that do house calls plus you get piece of mind knowing your animal is actually being looked at not like when you go visit the Dr and they go in alone .totally worth every hard earned penny<//Text>

I've been taking all of my dogs there for the past 10 years. One of my dogs just passed away and they were very sweet and nice about everything. They took him and gave us his ashes and we're sensitive. I can usually always get in pretty fast. They are really nice facilities and the vets are great!</Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>Appalling and horrendous.  That's the only way to describe my experience.  Yesterday, as I was riding my bike past Dr. Domotor's around 4:45pm, I noticed that there was a dead parrot in the grass in front of the "Animal Hospital".  I figured some low-life that couldn't be bothered to properly dispose of it had left it there to make it another person's problem.  Well, it became mine.

I went inside and told the lady at the front desk that there was a dead parrot outside of the building.  When she looked at me like she didn't know what to do, I offered to bring it inside if she gave me a box and a pair of gloves.  A lady came out in scrubs, and the first lady asked her if she would take care of it.  Her response was "I'm off the clock.  Can't you call Animal Control?"  The first lady then thanked me for telling them and assured me they would take care of it.

Well, I guess everyone was off the clock.  They didn't do anything, not even call Animal Control.  In this case, that would be the Pasadena Humane Society and SPCA.  I called them this morning after I walked past the building and the bird was still there.  When I called Dr. Domotor's to let them know what happened, I didn't even get a response, they just hung up on me without saying anything.

To make it clear, I would have been willing to take care of the bird myself in other circumstances.  Years ago, driving past a restaurant I worked at (on my day off), I noticed a dead cat in the road in front of the building.  I stopped, borrowed a shovel, and buried the cat away from the building.  Had I not, there's no telling how long it would have been there.  It's also less likely that the litter of kittens with her, which were still alive, would have been saved.  I don't usually carry a shovel on my bike, and I wasn't about to put a dead parrot in my pocket so I could rub it with my thumb like Lenny Small.

I also understand that you might be wary about a dead animal, and want to take certain precautions before exposing it to other animals.  There is absolutely no excuse for just leaving a dead animal in front of an "Animal Hospital" overnight, or even for ten minutes.  Perhaps at least somebody there has a brain and genuine concern for animals, but at least three don't.  If you take your pets there, good luck with the ones that end up handling them.<//Text>< Date>

<Review>I stopped going to Dr. Domoter shorty after prices went up. Also, the final straw for us was when I made an appointment to get my dog groomed, took time out of a very busy day to get there, and when I returned 5 hours later, I was told that they couldn't get to my dog (who had an appointment for a week) because they got in a full size poodle just that day. I asked if the full sized poodle had an appointment and the receptionist just stared at me with a blank face and shrugged. Why don't you try respecting people's time and maybe you will retain clientele.</Review>< user>

'Your dog is going to die' Only a cold, heartless, uncaring, compassion less individual could be capable of uttering such things at a time like this. I have taken my pets here before, but will never do that or recommend them to anyone. I urge you to find a vet with a respectable staff and someone that knows how to answer a phone and treat you and your pet with dignity!!!

She has taken care of dozens of my adopted cats and dogs, all in varying states of poor health and abuse.   I have recommended her services to friends and family who have felt their animals had problems other vets had failed to properly diagnose or treat.

I find her prices reasonable, and the extent of her compassion and care for each individual animal, as well as her education of the animals' companions, to a degree I have never experienced elsewhere.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d943b829aecf:0xdebb42e047bc37cb< /Gmap_id></record>

< review>
My first time -- had no choice because my beloved German Shepherd (Precious) collapsed and I was referred. Dr. Domotor gave it to me straight -- Precious had cancer (Hemangiosarcoma) with extensive internal bleeding. I asked for her opinion and decided it was best to put Precious out of her misery. The whole procedure was very professional and all the staff were very comforting.  Precious went to sleep very quietly and peacefully, which was my biggest concern. They even sent me a clay paw print with her name on it --- little things like that which meant a lot.

If ever I get another dog, I'll be going here.< /review>

I am a proud owner of an 80 lbs blue pit, who thinks he is a small toy breed. He was used as a bait dog when he was three weeks old, so his life did not begin with the best circumstances. He has been going to Dr. Domotor's since he was 6 weeks old and everyone knows and loves him. Just last month (April 2013) he was diagnosed with a Mast Cell Tumor. He had surgery and someone laid with him while he recovered (he cries like a baby). He is scared of Yorkies, and they are very understanding of that too. I wish I could use them as my primary! Dr. Byrns is wonderful...and she makes me laugh. Dr. Domotor is an excellent surgeon...and she makes me laugh too!< /review>

I left my 10 1/2 year old spayed Lab for three nights kenneling.  I took two standard bed pillows in sewn-together cases, a cotton throw rug that goes on top of the pillows, and in a large zip-lock a T-shirt I'd worn to provide my scent, a squeaky toy, and several large crunchy bones. I verbally asked them to place the pillow in her kennel and to give the dog the T-shirt, squeaky toy, and one crunchy bone per day.  The assistant acknowledged this.  The vet's assistant removed my dog's collar and scarf and gave them to me, saying they could be a choke hazard.  (It's the first time I'd had this occur for kenneling - there must have been a tragic experience in the past, but better safe than sorry)  I inspected the individual kennel my dog was in.  It was very clean and had a clean blanket on the concrete floor.  I was not allowed to open the gate and place the pillows inside, but was assured my dog would have them.

After the three nights I returned for my dog.  The dog was as healthy as when I left her.  I put her collar back on and asked for the pillows, T-shirt, etc. In a jiffy the assistant returned with the pillows, rug, and zip-lock.  The zip-lock contained the T-shirt, squeaky toy, and ALL of the crunchy bones.  The T-shirt, pillows, and rug had no dog hair on them.

I highly suspect that my pure bred, ACK-papers, house-dog had to sleep on a blanket over concrete with nothing to remind her of 10 1/2 years with her owner, or hope that she would be reunited with me.  My dog is healthy and Dr. Domnotor's kennel is very clean.  I have no complaint about the safety or sanitation of the kennels.  But I think I sent my dog to a Doggy Dachau.  She will not be kenneled there again.< /text>< pictures>

My mom has been going to Dr Demotor for 15 years. We moved during that time and have tried new vets that are closer. Every time we try a new vet we end up taking the animal back to Dr. Demotor because the other vets don't have the experience or knowledge about taking care of tricky issues. We have a dog with a gum infection we took her to another vet for 3 years and she lost over half her teeth. We got fed up and took her to Dr Domotor and the infection was clear within a few months. I have a cat who got into a fight. I tried taking her to VCA and they didnt find the puncture wounds. Because they didnt find the wounds the first time bacteria festered under her skin and now, a week later, she is loosing almost half of the skin on her back. The doctors at Dr Domotors office decided to take a skin culture to be sure that we were fighting the disease with the right antibiotics. No to mention they remembered to give me painkillers... Yea Dr. Domotor is expensive but it's a sure way to guarantee that your pet will get proper treatment by experienced professionals. You wont spend all your money visiting the vet for the same reason over and over. I hope they stay in business for as long as my cat will live.< /text>

<Text>Amazing service and delicious pastries. I ordered a cake for my mother's birthday which they were able to do the day prior. They were able to do writing in spanish as well for those who need spanish writing on cakes. The lady I spoke to when I made the cake order was very kind. Upon arriving there wasn't too much of a line only two other parties. They were able to attend me right after a person left the bakery. The space is fairly limited but they do a great job at keeping things safe. Everything is clear with prices and they also have these two jars with dirty and clean pens which is very thoughtful during these times. I will definitely be back to order more cakes. Thank you for the wonderful experience! I did not get the ladies name but she had dark hair and early 20s. Thank you see you soon!</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwXPY2ZeVSjWZ95D14nzhsXSBFDCuSwQlFyMt2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVDfPbzANrh9iYSwRKTkIm4LIwMi7Hf-Zwq9D6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJM82maNEdd_9xhJmaneKIyt3OCZvEJ8fqUkV0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO80eZxlrNHgTj-jNsSV_r9lBI2UMOuZGLxUVEJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7MrvEcOqTRDDkiXQi_28dNtAEedxJRmxsl_4x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgRE5K4VSq8XOPtutxiWesa-OabLlbNY-ipJd7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO58zh3Nt-kgymf9qLj_MIdaDetPc3RfijCJs8b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp-3ZD0i2QaNJI-t_pKNaPWfmzUrS8uTuaJVqa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

<Date>1605227324785</Date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Highly recommend this place if you like your cakes and pastries light, not-overly-sweet, and simple. Nothing complicated or glitzy here. They use good ingredients and good skills to provide good pastries. Definitely Asian style, yet the chocolate is chocolatey enough. I usually find other Asian bakeries use chocolate that doesn't really taste chocolatey enough, but not here. The fruits in the pastries are fresh and ripe. In other words, the bakers in the back are paying attention! Small place with small parking lot, but good taste with good selections. The front ladies are cheerful enough, despite the crowd waiting outside in line.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Been ordering cakes from here last 10 years and have never been disappointed! Not overly sweet and super soft. They have ready made cakes that are delicious as well in case you need a cake last minute. Additionally to cakes, their pastries are equally good and they are creative!<//review><name>Nihal Solomon< /name></record>

I've made a lot of potato pancakes and this one amazing, thick and fluffy, but crunchy on the outside. Fresh pretzel, good schnitzel, mashed potatoes were to die for.

<rating>5<//rating><text>You'll have to wait, but it's worth it. Angel Maid's strawberry cake is heavenly light with just the right sweetness for tart, bright strawberries. Their cream puffs are slightly crisp on the outside with lucious custard filling. With or without chocolate, they're too delicious to have just one. Ordered their custard pie today. It was good, better than most bakery custard pies. I thought the filling was smooth and creamy and not too sweet, just right, but didn't care for the crust. I think it's too thick  I'll enjoy the filling but avoid the crust. Overall, don't pass on this neighborhood gem.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Well, the Tres Leche 1/2 sheet cake for over $50, was disappointing. Terribly dry. Maybe I'm just spoiled, since I spend a lot of time in Antigua, Guatemala. And whenever I get it there, and from wherever it's always superb.
This one was not good at all.</review><Date>1620933664604<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Another PERFECT cake from Cake bakery! Consistently moist and delicious cakes. Owner was happy to help me choose my son's graduation cake and let me know that the cake size I was ordering was too big for the amount of guests I was serving. He made the same cake I wanted only smaller. He really didn't have to but he did. I was impressed. Highly Recommended for parties large or small.</Review>

Everything here is really great - but the noise is really overwhelming. Don't go here if you are on a first date or want to have a conversation. The beer selection is out of this world & so are the hearty meals. Meatloaf & schnitzel are my faves!< /Review>

I had heard about this place several times but never had a chance to go there.  I love bake goods and buy cakes for special occasions, two or three times per year.    So, I decided to go there for my girlfriend's birthday.  I ordered their strawberry cake.  It was absolutely the tastiest cake I have ever had.  All other people in the party including my Girl friend thought the same.  The price was very reasonable.  The decoration was perfect.  The cake was SUPER SUPER tasty.   You have to try it for yourself. I will recommend this place to everyone.<//text>

I was looking forward to getting my daughter a cane from here to celebrate her birthday. I drove 20 minutes since online it said they would be open from 8-12pm . I got there and the place is closed for two weeks ! I think they could’ve at least updated that on their website.</review>

Delicious cakes and lovely atmosphere. Cakes are a bit prices if your on a budget but over they have delicious pastries and employees look like hardworking people, honestly they deserve the 5 stars and highly recommend to get yourself delicious cake. Only thing I want to point out is that there isnt much parking and when the bakery is busy it could be a bit of a challenge to find parking but at the end its worth it</text>

Last week I ordered a cream birthday cake for my mom as a birthday present in the store. I felt the cake was particularly beautiful packaging and the attitude of the waiter is very friendly. Of course, the taste of the cake is also particularly good. I will come again in the later time.< /review>

I was happy to find out the ratings were accurate on the beer AND food here. The Jagerschnitzel was delicious, especially the pan-seared looking pasta lol. Just saw the menu, it's called spatzle... YUM!< /Review>

Great cakes, pastries, cookies and sweets. Went here after my neighbor recommended. Prices you can beat. I got a white chiffon cask with whipped frosting and fresh strawberries and some decorations and writing. It was so delicious and was still fresh after a day. Well worth the drive my house.< /Text>

Love the cakes and flavors,but the only thing that bothers me is they can't do disney characters for a cake or movie characters etc. And it's something that I usually need in a cake for my kids or for my loved ones. If they were able to do it I would definitely give 5 stars and also if there was a parking specifically for the bakery there's no parking but 2 spots available and there's always a long line :(< /text>

My dad even started singing about them during our Father/Daughter dance (to the tune we were dancing to) and my mom admitted to sneaking a few while we were cleaning up the event. She is the funnest, sweetest, most talented cake maker. 1000% recommend her for your next event big or small (or even if you want a dozen amazing cupcakes all to yourself for no reason other than to enjoy amazing cupcakes)</Review>< UserId.>

My go-to place for cake. They specialize in soft, moist sponge/chiffon cake with light whip cream topping (versus the heavy, brick-like buttercream popular in bakeries around town).

Favorites are the strawberry shortcake, chocolate doberge and chocolate banana!<//Text>

Angel is great! She made the cake exactly how we wanted it.
She took the time to research since I had a special request and she was honest, fun and professional since the beginning.
The cake was beautiful and delicious!
We are hooked with her baking!
Thank you again Angel for being part of our special day!<//Review>

This morning just right now I went to pick up a cake for my little daughter I specifically said I wanted a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting but as I received it I got white frosting instead this was very unacceptable because I believe I said what I wanted specifically and now my daughter is all upset and this is why they should be receiving a won star from me very disappointed.<//Review>

Everything you buy from this place is fresh and delicious! I have been a client for over 15 years. I have purchased for my family and friends Birthday cakes, cookies, muffins, croissants etc from this bakery and always satisfied. Also they have an incredible customer service!<//Review>

Beautiful Cake , Great Service
I ordered this cake just 2 days before I pick it up , the pickup date was on Monday and they are closed on that day , but they opened the store just to give me my order .
Excellent Service , I would give them even more stars.
If you want a cake with a good Quality and also a great taste Don't even think about somewhere else just go to Angel Maid Bakery and order it .
You will be completely satisfied guaranteed
Thank you Angel Maid Bakery< /Review>

<Text>There are no words to express my love for Angel Maid Bakery. My husband and I were speechless when our wedding cake was delivered. Not only was it EXACTLY what we wanted but the cake was SO delicious! My husband ate 5 slices at our wedding. FIVE! Thank you soooo much! Can't wait to order our baby shower cake in February!< /Text>< pics>

Absolutely decadent desserts and pastries!  I've had the pleasure of sampling most of their offerings and  have never gone home disappointed.  It's the type of place that you go in with your mind made up but then,  as soon as you gander all of that deliciousness, you can't decide what you want because you want everything.  Trust me, these things are as good as look!  Very dangerous!!!

The only reason for the 4 star is because they don't have pastries on Sunday, which as it turns out, the perfect time for a fresh pastry.<//text>

All natural flavors and ingredients. Flavor and texture are incredible. A must go to spot for all pastries lovers!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

<Text>The cakes here are delicious and are always top notch. If you order something the cake will always be fresh. I don't know where they get their strawberries because even if they aren't in season their strawberry shortcake is always the best. The staff is very friendly and always serve with a smile. The prices are a little on the high side but that's expected when you get this high quality of cake.<//Text></record>

It doesn't get better than this. Their cakes are amazing, their cream puffs are so addicting you may need professional help. It's my neighborhood bakery, but if I lived out of the area, I'd still make the trip.<//Review>

Family favorite bakery with reasonable prices and ridiculously good cakes. Not too sweet, not too dry, their cakes are top tier, my favorite being the guava or passion fruit chiffon cakes. Truly a special bakery that is easily overlooked when driving past. Parking lot is small, but the slight inconvenience is worth it to get a taste of this bakery’s pastries and cakes and cookies and pies!< /Review>

I have been visiting since first opened . Loyal because the goods are all excellent and affordable, and the people are so kind and efficient. It’s hard to mention a favorite, but I’ll go with the strawberry cake and tea cakes ...ok, I like it all.</review>

<review>I tried to pick up a cake outside of being pre-ordered and they were sold out of everything. Strongly recommend ordering in advance.
I understand it was a last-minute decision and a surprise. Since they did not have any choices left, I asked the attendant if he knew of another bakery near by. His response very smug was "Nope!" I thanked him and walked away.
To the owner of the bakery, the answer should have been "We recommend ordering in advance, but being that you are in a bind, try this place in the meantime. They will not be as great as ours but we understand your desperation". Instead, you've got a 19-year-old behind the counter that really should sweeten his disposition, no pun! Demoting to Devil Butler Bakery. Training 101</review>< pictures>

Above average coffee, melt in your mouth pastries that they can heat up for you are delicious. Affordable for a quick breakfast; around $5 for a double espresso and a chocolate croissant.< /Text>

Best little desserts you've ever tasted.  Too bad they are so far away from where we live.  Or maybe it's a good thing🤔🙂

Where do I start? Well I tried to place my order over the phone and the guy who answered would not allow it. I called them several times including today to confirm I can place my order, and to my surprise. Same problem. Phone is off the hook.

I am grading this on customer service. Horrible customer service.</Text>

< Review>
I have shopped here for many many years their prices have always been high but the strawberry cake was worth it rather then driving to china town but today not only were the prices high 28.00 for an 8 inch cake and then they charged me to write Happy Birthday on it the manager I spoke with was very rude and I was told they don't have a website to complain and if I didn't like it I could go somewhere else which had I had more time I would have but I have been in the hospitality industry for 45 years and the treatment I received as a customer was unbelieveable and I will say nothing good about this bakery ever and I may only be one person but I will make sure my displeasure known to as many people as I can<//Review>

If you love light, not overly sweet Japanese style cakes, you gotta try Angel Maid Cakes. Get their signature strawberry shortcake for a birthday party. We have done it many times. They usually have them in store in 7 or 8" options. If you want custom sizes I think you can call in and order for pick up. They have other beautiful and tasty cakes, pies and cookies so bring your sweet tooth.< /text>

Best Bakery in town. If you're a chocolate chip cookie lover.. YOU HAVE TO BUY their bag of tiny chocolate chip cookies. I can honestly devour the entire bag all by myself. I'm a chocolate chip cookie addict, but not just their cookies are delicious. The Strawberry Shortcake is absolutely perfect, and their chocolate banana cake -woooweee! Give them a try, for sure.</review>

The best in west side, if you like Asian cakes. But if you go to the east side of LA, you can easily find an Asian bakery that beats it. 4 start because this place is too small and does not have a good parking lot. Street parking possible though.<//Text>

You might just miss the turn into their parking lot, but it's such an amazing bakery that it's worth pulling a U-turn.

The pastries at this place are a-ma-zing!! every time I get a chance I stop, buy a few things and share them with my co-workers. I have tried pretty much everything but the cakes, so I can't really comment on that but if they are anything like the cookies and mousse you are set.< /Text>

<Text>The cake we ordered for my daughter’s 11th birthday was as delicious as it was beautiful, and very reasonably priced.  We ordered and picked up the cake the same day.  All three generations of family members said this was the best cake they have ever tasted!  We are currently justifying ordering another one just to have more!< /Text>< Pictures>

After seeing the great reviews for this bakery I decided to get a cake for my Wife's birthday. I got a tres leches cake and it was awesome. The friends came over for the party also applauded the taste of the cake. After this we have got different cakes for different occasions and every time we were satisfied with the quality and the taste of the cakes. The macaroons and other sweets sold there also tasty and you will not be disappointed.<//text>

Only street parking available, but you don't hard to worry about meters and you can usually find a quick and convenient spot.< /review>< Pics>

I love Angel Maid Bakery !!
If we ever have a birthday party, celebration or just in the mood for cake we always go there! They have an amazing German chocolate cake, good Croissant and Pain au chocolat. The Apple turnover is very good too. It's the one I always get!
The staff is always super friendly.< /text>

Would be nice to get a little treat withOUT them bringing political sexual agendas into the transaction.
The pin is OFFENSIVE.
Keep your personal life on your personal time.
Let your time on the job be about the job.

I've been going to Angel Maid for many years. Being a local I make sure to go at least a few times a year. My favorite is the chocolate cake with the banana filling and whipped cream frosting, yummy. My fiance likes the lemon chiffon and my sister goes with the strawberry short cake. We also got a German chocolate cake from them once, I'm not a fan at all, but was pleasantly surprise how delicious it was! They are reasonably priced, I recommend ordering a head and always allow a short wait time because they are busy!!! They are always kind and helpful. I highly recommend them, I'm going to be getting my wedding cake from them. That is how much I love them!! I thank them for many years of great service!!!!!!!!</text>

The bakery from my childhood.  They used to make donuts and danishes but now they just stick to cakes and small gourmet pastries. Japanese style bakery...  Not too sweet and incredible light and fluffy texture.< /text>

< Review>
I really love Angel Maid Bakery. We recently got our daughter's first birthday cakes from there. Did I mention we got five different kinds? Yes, we got five! :)

Instead of having one large sheet cake we got two marble custards (our favorite), two fresh strawberries (fan favorite) and chocolate dobash. The marble and the chocolate both have custard and it's so delicious. Delicious as in refreshing, creamy and oh so tasty.

We normally buy all our cakes from there and do they a great job every time we order from them. It's hard not to resist some cream puffs while you are there too, which is also so good! Everything is so good!

Delicious cakes with great people who work there and very affordable. I love Angel Maid. Love!<//Review>

The best bakery in West Los Angeles area.
I've been their customer since 1986.
The best eclaire, the best mocha cake, the best chocolate cake,
the best any mousse filling cakes and the best apple pie.
They are very moist and not sweet like some other bakeries in town.<//Text>

<Text>A friend introduced me to Angel Maid Bakery and I was a fun for almost 4 years until last year for my son's 8th birthday and they gave us an old decorated cake, even the birthday boy whose a huge cake fun didn't even eat his slice.  Hopefully I get over it and order another cake from them.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

3 people in front counter got everybody's order down professionally. Very happy to see that and to add things while the location is tough to spot and find parking the store itself is clean and beautiful. Baked goods satisfy my sweet tooth and satisfaction.</Review>

<review>We ordered a tres leches cake for my husband's birthday from Angel Maid Bakery.  The cake was excellent.  This cake was light, moist, and super delicious.  Everyone at our dinner party could not get over the cake...we will order again from Angel Maid Bakery. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One comment:  I wish that we could have paid for the cake over the phone with our c/c. It would have made things easier for us...but overall, you guys are great.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The cakes are delicious, they're a little pricey but every cake is very good, they are soft not to Sweet, and they have great customer service. The only down side is that they don't have good parking.< /Review>

Cakes are always great. Frosting is never to sweet, and love the fruit filling options.< /Review>

Very nice, helpful, and patient staff.  Parking was tough, though, with only 3 spots, which were all taken, and a driveway off of a very busy street with poor visibility.< /review>

(Translated by Google) If you want to eat Japanese cake at WLA, this is a Nikkei-owned shop! You can't eat inside, just take it home, but it's very delicious and recommended.

日系人経営のお店で、WLAで日本のケーキを食べたいならここ！持ち帰りのみで、中で食べることはできませんが、とってもおいしくおすすめです。<//review>
