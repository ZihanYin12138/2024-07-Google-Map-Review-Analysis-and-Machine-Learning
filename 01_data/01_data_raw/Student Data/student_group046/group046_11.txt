Kong's Pet & Grooming Salon is amazing! They opened early for my mother, and as she had her chihuahua groomed, they were able to coordinate special dog treats and a last minute dog Birthday Cake for my pugs 1st birthday! It was so special and so appreciated! Would recommend them to anyone in the area!<//review>

Im a truck driver and my 2 schnauzers are my companions. Its been about 3 months since i got them groomed so it was time. I called about 6 groomers the day before i arrived in Vernon, California and none of them had any time or openings for my dogs.
I called Kong's and the gentleman on the phone was very nice and said "no problem" bring them in Sunday morning. I did, he got both my dogs washed and groomed within an hour and a half. They look awesome! Thanks you all! If im back in the area again, your my place of choice.</text>

The manager or owner what ever he is was very nice. He was a no bull straight to the point type of guy and we like that. My dogs got exactly what they need it. Washed and nailed trim and something for their glands. It's been three days now and my dogs still smell and feel clean. I will be going back on March for my dogs teeth cleaning which is 150 dollars cheaper than my regular place.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>We call yesterday to make an appointment for today to take my dog for a grooming service the appointment was at 11 my wife was a little bit behind, she get there at 11:15 the person on the front desk started  screaming at my wife and yelling at here because she get 15 minutes after, he never listens to her, my wife tryed to talk to him but was impossible. My wife just walk away and end to take it some were alse.
I own a business on in these 15 years I mean learn that the customer service has to be number one priority in any business if you don't have the knowledge and the availity how to handle your customers you should not be there I don't recommend this place at all be careful because if he trade the customers like he did to my wife imagine how he would treat your pet so please don't take your pets in this place< /Review>< pictures>

The staff at Kong's Pets & Grooming are super friendly.  They treat my yorkie-chihuhua with so much love as if it were their own.  They do an outstanding job at getting my little one looking at her best and smelling great.  They also have a great variety of pet clothing, accessories, food and supplies to meet your needs.<//Review>

<Text>I love it here my dog loves it here!
I originally heard of this place from a family member.
I had worries about my dog that because he is a pit. Most groomer treat him like a hazard Kong treated him like FAMILY
I originally took my dog in because of the summer fleas are known to be out more and I wanted to protect him but I also wanted something for the bottom of my dogs paws because they were cracking.
The staff was very friendly and let me know the products that I could use to help with that.
I then decided to take my dog for a bath... they left my puppy like new!!!!
The bottom of his paws were very smooth he had no fleas and his fur was so soft and he was no longer shedding BUT what I liked most was that he smelled and felt great
while my dog was taking his bath I looked around and saw a lot of cute accessories for pets I ended up leaving with a new dog tag it was very cute it was shaped like a fire hydrant and was even red the tag was done in 2 mins
I loved that after the bath we were made to feel like he we were long time customers they gave my dog treats
all this for a low cost I would really recommend this place
I will never go back to petco in my life
A tag in petco is 16 dollars at kongs it was 6 and it was nicer< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Never again will order. Place a order at 5:30 pm told me it will be ready at 5:45 pm. I get there at 6:00 pm and the guy in the front tells me my order is not ready that he was busy and that it will be ready in 10 minutes. I said ok I’ll wait  I come back at 6:10  I come back and he only has 1 pizza done and tells me he does have cheese to make more. After I waited so long for him to tell
Me that got me upset and ask for my money back and the he says he has to call someone because manager is not there. You can tell this guy didn’t k ow what he was doing and the manager no where to be found because he did show up to work. Will never come here again. I ended up ordering from Pizza Hut and my order was ready in 10 minutes.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2cce009c23925:0x12ae1dbeec81e08f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I stopped here for a Gigante pizza on a Saturday night and the place wasn't very busy. The cashier was nice and quick to find my order and get it to me. I did call ahead to order my pizza in case they got busy before I got there. This pizza was a great addition to our Saturday night fun!<//Text>

< review>
I noticed on their website that they said that they changed their recipe, and so decided to try La Pizza Loca again.  Sure enough, the Pizza tastes better, and is less dry and no longer tastes like cardboard, but the cheese is still mediocre and I wouldn't say that they're quite up to the quality levels of the major Pizza chains just yet.

They're a lot closer though, and remain a great value, however.  The recent $5 1-topping Large and the $6 2-topping Large (which may only be available online) are excellent deals, and dipping sauces are cheap, if you want to buy those too.

My recommendation for a tastier Pizza is to get extra sauce.  It adds more flavor, and makes the pizza more moist.  I just tried a Pepperoni Pizza with Onion on the left side and Mushroom on the right, and it counts as "2 toppings" and was surprisingly tasty.

Service remains excellent at this store, and was also speedy.  I've never had an issue with it, and I've been coming here for years.< /review>

< Review>
Got a beta fish for my kid. The store is always clean and packed with supplies. Other time i have been here, I have gotten items such as pet carriers, cat food, kitten milk... they seem to have it. This day had some pets for adoption, such as a big beautiful slithering snake and a guiny pig.</Review>

<review>One of the better stores in the RB area of San Diego. The staff is friendly and are great at asking for advices. Their prices are also very competitive for the place and have a huge range of options for everyone to choose from.
Will shop more here for my two little kitties. ^_^< /review>< Pics>

< review>
Got truly the cutest hamster here for our son's birthday.  They had a great selection of hamsters, cages and bedding.  The woman helping us was also super knowledgeable.  We even went back when he chewed through the first cage and got a much better one based on her recommendation.  Even got a practically noiseless wheel.  Best thing of all!<//review>

Kahoots is a local San Diego chain of pet supplies store. You will find top quality pet food, but not the major national brands. Kahoots also has their own brands of pet food. this location has a couple of betta fish, guinea pigs, hamsters, and maybe a bird that can be adopted but no cats or dogs to be purchased.<//Review>

<Text>I think they should carry "Dog Bark Naturals" they are all natural dog treats made here in the USA and by a friend of mine. I have a dog who by the way is VERY PICKY on his treats after Kahoots brand treats went away I've tried all kinds of other treats and he turns his nose..... With Dog Barks he gets very excited like he did before with the Kahoots brand. They only make 5 different kinds Bacon, Chicken, Beef, Roo (Kangaroo) & Shark.<//Text>< Pictures>

If you stop by here, find a rabbit named Jack and tell him I said hello.

He'll know what's up.< /review>

Great brick oven Neapolitan pizza!! The pizzas had great flavor profiles and delicious chewy thin crust. I read other reviews that said not to skip the burrata, so we ordered it with Focaccia. Honestly not sure how much I would have enjoyed it without the Focaccia, but it was absolutely outstanding with. (My first time having burrata).

We ordered the Spicy Chomper and Sweet Cheeks to try each a red and white pizza. They were very different but both very good! I personally preferred the savory Spicy Chomper over the sweet Sweet Cheeks. You probably can’t go wrong with any pizza you order on the menu.

The only other places I’ve had great brick oven Neapolitan pizza like this is in Naples, Italy and at A Tavola in Cincinnati, OH. I will definitely be back to try more!

The cacio e Pepe risotto had really good flavor, but I was a little disappointed. I think cacio e pepe needs to stay on pasta and the risotto made it taste like it was missing something. Probably wouldn’t order again.

Tiki, do you love me was a tropical paradise drink. Delicious.</review>

So on any normal night I would say this place is over the moon wonderful and I recommend it to all my friends who come into town and it’s our go to neighborhood eating spot. The chicken is always spot on, never dry and delicious as well as the pizzas. Just this evening, we experienced less of a friendly welcome. We sat, went inside to order (which is never an issue because it keeps everyone safe) got our drinks, Caesar salad, broccoli and my half chicken. After eating my chicken we still waited for my husbands pizza to arrive. I went inside to check and they forgot about it, which I understand can happen and typically I wouldn’t even bother saying anything, it was just the aftermath of no acknowledgement, Decided to leave and not bother to wait for the order. The hospitality industry is slowing making its way back in LA which is great for everyone but the service and friendliness needs to follow as well. We still left a tip because it goes to everyone and it would be cruel to punish all for a mistake.

Everyone has their bad days and good days so if your first impression was poor, try the place again and then judge!  (That goes for any restaurant)

Still the food speaks for itself and never falls short of delicious and excellent, so stop by for a visit, their take out is great as well. ☺️

Also try their creative Ice Cream!!< /review>

If you're looking to try one of LA's best pizzas... Ronan is it. Neapolitan-style pizza plus a full bar with great cocktails. They also have a nice patio for outdoor dining or you can get their pizza kit to make at home. We grilled the dough and it turned out perfect. They also have a bodega with different pastas, sauces, and ingredients for pickup.< /Review>

Very bad service
Very bad attitude
100% unrespectful
Don't waste your time, there are plenty of restaurants in LA with much better service. Sad to see such as service after all this lockdown, I was sure that restaurants will improve their service and attitude and understand that nothing is granted< /Review>

When Sotto closed it was a tragedy for pizza in LA...however the team at Ronan do a phenomenal job at taking their place. While the pizzas aren't as big, they take a little more liberty with trying new toppings. The nduja and fermented celery pizza was outstanding, with an amazing crunch and deep spicy flavor. The shared seabass plate was also quite special as a large format sharing dish. Definitely will be back< /text>

I had been wanting to try this place for some time. Overall I thought the food was good, but just overpriced.

The burrata was delicious, but when they asked us if we wanted bread with it we didn’t realize it would have been $9 extra charge. That would have been nice to know, I didn’t expect bread to be an extra charge lol. (The bread was very good though I should note.)

The chicken parm is worth trying but also a lot of food for just 2 people.

We also got a pepperoni pizza which tasted fine but I thought was a bit too doughy. I prefer crispier pizza.

I think had we come here with 3 or 4 people it would have made a bit more sense when the bill came, for 2 people though I think there’s better options out there.< /Text>

We did a pizza tour of 8 pizza places and this one finished 2nd on taste with an asterisk. The price is absurd for it's small personal-pan-pizza size.

we had the Spicy Chomper (TOMATO, SOPPRESSATA, QUATTRO FORMAGGI), as it's the closest they have to pepperoni and it was FREAKIN' DELICIOUS. Great pizza. Incredible crust. Way too overpriced, but if you're gonna over pay for pizza, choose HERE!<//text>

Crazy about this place. It might be my favorite and most visited spot in LA. Sit at the bar.

Fantastic and innovative cocktails courtesy of Rachel, the beverage manager. If you’re lucky enough to have her serving you, ask as many questions as you can (if she’s not too busy). She’ll happily explain the different ingredients, rare liqueurs, and unique processes that go into each, and she’ll take plenty of time to make you feel like you matter and your experience is important.

If this was just a cocktail bar it would get 5 stars, but the pizza and everything else on the menu is truly excellent as well. Amazing flavors all around, and consistent dish to dish, visit to visit. Check out the clam dish, which is served in an intensely tasty broth, underneath a naked pizza with a hole in it, with which you can make tacos and mop up all the great juice left on the bottom. Mind blowing, and I’m definitely not a shellfish fanatic.

This place doesn’t beat around any bushes, and I know I’m going to leave happy every time.  Sit at the bar.<//text>

<name>Emma Shupe< /name><Text>I love this place. They have great pizza and they always keep the line moving. It never takes too long to get our food. It's a nice place and it's very clean. Also, I love the pizza. My favorite part about it is that it's not soggy, burnt, and it tastes amazing. It's not overly oily. I'm a regular and I love it. There are so many toppings to choose from you'll never get tired or bored of it. Also. All of the ingredients are higher quality and you can really taste it as a result.</Text><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

The ‘Sweet Cheeks’ is the greatest pizza I’ve ever had. I repeated myself that’s how good it is. It’s not even that complex of a pizza. Ricotta forte, Pepe honey, it’s just the most unreal combo on a well made pizza. Look it up, get it, you’ll thank me later. Oh my GOD< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Got the French dip calzone for delivery I’ve read so much about and it does not disappoint. Came a tad burnt maybe, but it still tasted so good. Perfectly cooked medium rare to medium shaved roast beef, cheese, stuffed into the great calzone pizza dough that has a nice chew to it and charred flavor. The au jus dip has some dollops of mustard, I believe Dijon? And it pairs so well with the calzone. Highly recommend and can’t wait to try the pizza’s.<//Review><Response>None<//Response><user_name>Glarence Zhao< /user_name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOs2OMOfr2I1RKhl3N13_o5HprWPoMq7Wisaawr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxy80vYu7XoiqAl_Vd1JNH_caZDlOjWjmgvjW5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><user>113660044534951776646</user><date>1585183561945<//date>< Rate>

<review>I made reservation for a  Friday date night, and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. We decide to sit at the bar for dinner. We ordered the Sea Bass Zarandeado Banchan Style and Burrata - Romanesco. The burrata was soft and creamy and work beautifully almond pesto. The sea bass was cooked to perfection. This dish is not meant for one person. The banchan style is an awesome way to have the meal. This place is great for date night.<//review>< Response>

Dining at Ronan was more underwhelming that I had expected or hoped for. A few friends and I came here on a Monday night for dinner, and since it's a new spot on Melrose, I was expecting great things.

It's tucked away on Melrose and there is valet parking and lots of street parking which is nice. It has a nice patio and a trendy inside. For Monday, it was pretty packed, which was promising. One thing that was very odd that we all noticed is that all three of us kept sneezing and coughing while we were there. It felt like the atmosphere was inducing some kind of allergic reaction, which was very strange.

The staff was friendly and helpful, and the menu was fine. It felt like they were trying really hard to be trendy, with the menu just describing items without telling us what they really were. ("Avocado, Fig, Cheese") without telling us if it was a salad, a main dish, etc.

I ordered the Sweet Cheeks Pizza, which was good and decent sized, but for $21, I would have expected more substance to the food. My friends enjoyed their dishes as well, but it truly was nothing that blew us out of the water. The portions were not huge, but not tiny either.

They do add a 20% gratuity onto the menu, so you don't need to factor in tip.

It's a fine place to check out, but I won't be returning again if I am craving pizza, as there are plenty of other spots that have similar menus for less money and bigger portions. It's a nice trendy spot to meet friends, however, but if you are wanting a full and unique meal, I'd go elsewhere.< /Review>

I was lucky to be invited to Ronan for a whiskey paired dinner last year.   I am so happy I was introduced to this place.  The staff is so friendly and professional and the ownership is an incredible team of people.   The tiramisu here is hands down the BEST tiramisu I've ever had.   I drove out to LA from OC just before father's day just so I could bring a slice to my dad. :)

Their food is too notch.  Everything is so fresh and so well prepared.   The branzino I had at that dinner has danced around in my dreams!     Thank you guys for everything you're doing! Stay safe! <3</text>

$26 for a small pizza and people pay this. ?Puck lobster pizza was better and cheaper   Service charge 20%for bringing a pizza to your table $8 for bread. This is a   Restaurant that needs to find out exactly who it is. A pizzeria or a fine restaurant in shorts and sneakers   I wouldn’t go back there are so many places with better pizza and better ambience another nickel and dime or type of place< /review>

Underwhelming and sneaky.

Difficult to book into, difficult to contact, difficult to even see from Melrose - if they are trying to create mystique and buzz, all they’re accomplishing is being annoying.

Food started off strongly, the appetizers were great.

Pizzas were disappointing - overly complex and a muddle of flavors.

The wine list veers into natural wine territory = expensive, stingy pours and tastes reminiscent of Erewhon’s tonic bar.

It felt like we were being taken advantage of - we were encouraged to order so much food that we ended up with $50 of unwanted, uneaten leftovers in the fridge for a week.

With so many great Italian restaurants in the area, don’t bother with Ronan.</text>

The waitress was the one who ruined it completely. She was condescending from the start. It was taking forever for our food to come out given that our friends who ordered couple minutes earlier already received and finished their dishes. We were running late and asked her what was going on. To which she replied: "They ordered waaay earlier and your food is coming now". Just a matter of fact, no sorry, nothing. At a restaurant like this you really expect a bit different treatment. Our whole group so upset that we refused to pay 20% service fee, which they add to the check (apparently they are trying to protect themselves being aware of their crappy service), and made a note of that on the check. But they had the audacity to still charge the fee. Very disappointing.</Review>< rate>

Bread service and the Margerita Pizza with Burrata were highlights of our dinner. If you like chewy cookies, get the Snickerdoodle cookies. Didn't care for the Almond milk granita but the cookies were damn good! Will definitely go back.</review>

Then the 2nd time there was 2 women and all they did was talk literally took them 30 mins to do my order....the cashier lady who I believe is the owner was arguing with some lady because she wanted her money back for the long wait.  Also about giving her the wrong change. I just took my order and left, The 3rd time it was wayyyyyy worse i got the wrong meat on my burritos. took like 30 minutes again for my order she even ended up oweing me 5 cents now imagine if I didn't have those 5 cents for the food would she have let me off Scott free ?? I'm done with this placee....<//Review>< pics>

A friend offered to buy dinner (5 people total), at a new restaurant. Sounded good, the woman behind the counter made them uncomfortable but they were too hungry to care. Came up to $52, no big deal still. They bring it home and one of the orders was missing entirely.  The beans in my tostada were very, very old and gross. They literally smelled like poop and I could not bring myself to eat it, as the smell alone literally gave me a gag reflex I never experienced before with "fresh" beans. It's like they were left out for over a week or something. The tostada itself left much to be desired anyway. The burritos didn't taste good either (guessing it was the old beans too). The worst part was this morning when, one of the dishes we thought was ok, was reheated for breakfast. Zip tie. In the food. I included an image. Do not go here. These people don't care about their job or the customers.</Text>

<Review>This was my first time coming here, I order a steak burrito and 3 stake tacos. First of the burrito had more rice than meat second the meat wasn't even cooked all the way and had lot of fat. Same with the tacos they were discussing with no flavor to the meet. Then I grabbed some salsa and that didn't have no flavor what so ever it looked so water down. I will never come here again period</Review>< UserId.>

<text>This place is slowing going down hill due to the owner of this place hiring lazy Central American ladies to run the business. This place used to be great until they hired this people.

Bought a bunch of tacos and a Cubana torta, we got the tacos and they were pretty good but they forgot her torta. I called to talk to them and they never answered. She drove all the way back to the east side to get it cause that’s all she wanted, they were relaxing and told her sorry they forgot it but there was nothing they could do. It took her to complain about it for them to finally refund her for the torta. This will be the last time that we eat here cause of there lack of care and customer service!</text>

Got a carne asada burrito and I ate like 2 bites and parts of the rice were old or raw because they were really hard like chewing raw rice I told the cook and she looked at me like an idiot and said she would cook a new one then the cashier came to question me saying no one had complained like of I was trying to get something free they were rude and said I had already took a bite and brought me a new tiny burrito with no rice just beans and like 5 little pieces of meat with that type of service I'd rather not come back. Customer is always correct and it's there job to fix it I showed them and I didn't have to give a full on explanation as if I had stole something from them because that how they took it.<//Review>

It doesn't look flesh anymore
And is just super dirty inside

Food is better at mi ranchito across the street. Dinning room area is not clean,there's flys sitting in the cilantro and onions.  The bathroom is dirty. The female employees are busy gossiping, so your food will take time to prepare. They had no customers, no long lines. Service was still slow.<//text>

Tacos LA Babosa is what it should be called GREAT FOOD BAD SERVICE. They will treat you bad if you correct them. They won't own up to their mistakes. May mess up your order. The main Babosa there is the dark skin lady with a mole.</text>

Food is great. Love the huarache and tacos surtidos! I have mixed emotions about the service. There have been times where I've gone and they are super nice, even start a conversation. I like the lady that cooks, dont know if there are a lot but the one that I've seen is nice. Most of the time, people do have an attitude. The cashier's are the worst. Dont ask for anything because you'll get the fuchi face. Don't ask questions eighter. The guy that cooks outside on the weekends is also pretty bad. I understand the pressure when its busy but dude these people sweat out their stress. To be fair I have seen some pretty dumb customers, unfortunately everyone gets to pay for it...</review>

Service is always slow because the ladies are always gossiping, it’s always a bit dirty and they are never open when I stop by for lunch not worth the time and money<//text>

(Translated by Google) The tacos are delicious but the service HORRIBLE !! The old granddaughter always has a face and a bad attitude .. Never ahy salsa and whenever we ask them they tell us "yes ahy I'm going" but in a bad way they tell you things and nothing .. Sometimes I arrive with my husband and ignore us old brown but we only go because the tacos are good .. If I could give them zero stars I would give them!

(Original)
Los tacos estan deliciosos pero el servicio HORRIBLE!! La vieja prieta siempre tiene una cara y una mala actitud.. Nunca ahy salsa y siempre que les pedimos nos dicen "si ahy voy" pero con una mala forma te dicen las cosas y nada.. Aveces llego con mi esposo y nos ignora la vieja prieta pero solamente vamos porque los tacos si estan buenos.. Si pudiera darles zero estrellas se las daria!</Review>

Food was good. Service was awesome, and staff were friendly, but many tables had food crumbs and needed to be cleaned.<//review>

They have several choices of pizzas, a menu of sandwiches, and a salad bar that looks fresh.  Their staff are helpful, and fast.  I can walk in, order a pizza and be out of their within 20 mins.
They have 15% off coupons they send to your residence almost every week.  I love their Guinevere Pizza, (no meat),   and for those who like to stay home, you can always order from home.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Lunch buffet is terrible. Never any pizza or breadsticks available, tables dirty, plates dirty so they can't even give you one (although with no food available guess that doesn't matter), and they want to charge (but can't figure out how to do so on the register) for "hand made, expensive" cups of marinara sauce for the breadsticks. Not worth it and poorly managed.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I love round table pizza. I went to the San Luis Obispo restaurant for the first time and brought my wife there too. She had never had a Round Table pizza before and I wanted her to try it. We went for the lunch special. We both put lots of Parmesan cheese on top of our pizzas and the pizza was pretty good. Just as I had finished, my wife noticed a black  bug that was about a half inch to an inch long inside the Parmesan cheese shaker. The bug was alive and pretty active in the cheese. I took the shaker to the manager and she said it was pretty disgusting. My wife didn't want to finish the last slice of her pizza and I didn't want it either after what I saw.  The manager said it was a "pincher" bug and they were all over San Luis. She said they sprayed every month but the area was infested with them. I kept wondering if they lay eggs in the cheese that we liberally  sprinkle out over the pizzas. It could have happened to any restaurant I suppose, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively that is).< /text>< pictures>

Granted, I have not gotten fresh pizza in a while but I was not expecting this: a medium pizza costs TWENTY DOLLARS. That is the normal price (before discounts and taxes) for a plain cheese pizza at this place. I have been going to Mountain Mike's for a long time and I think that I will stay there. At least $20 is the large over there.</Review>

<text>I walked in to a young lady counting her til. She gave me an annoyed look so I told her to go ahead and finish counting the til. It took her about 10 mins. Then it took almost another 30 mons to get me my breadsticks. I was seriously pissed.

I asked about how it was made. One of the managers told me that it's a secret. I told her that I'm from Florida so she gave me another cup to go. Please make it out to Florida. Your food is great and everyone is super personable!< /text>< Pics>

<review>Amazing food and quick service. Great for takeouts. Not so much of room inside to sit but the food totally compensates that. Must go and very close to the airport. Don't forget to try their jalapeno dressing.</review>< pics>

I've been twice now and probably won't be back.  For some reason I can't pinpoint, I'm just not a huge fan of the food.  The chicken shawarma is a bit too salty and didn't have a lot of flavor.  Maybe I just picked the wrong toppings and sauces.  The falafel is good though as a side or appetizer.<//text>

<Review>It tastes good, but they are rude and run the restaurant awkwardly, all while messing up the order.

If you want curbside pick up, you might have to call them multiple times to convince them to come out, even with no one else there. After calling them, the order sat on the counter as we sat in the car waiting right outside. Eventually, we had to go in and pick it up. The employee seemed to be upset and purposefully being rude about everything like having us repeat the order name three times.

After all that, I discovered my order was missing my protein choice which I paid extra for. It just doesn’t make me want to come back to this location.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

The service was good, but I didn't really like the food at all. I love Mediterranean food, but for some reason the food was terrible to me. The flavors were awful and not authentic in the slightest bit. Plus $15 was super expensive for a fast-casual bowl with a drink.</review>

Good food friendly helpful staff as well.. You will be full after a bowl and lemonades. They have about 5 types of lemonades . Not easy to find at night hidden hole in wall location and bar bones interior. Plenty of sauce flavors and hummus.< /Review>

<Text>Great food. Serveral vegan options and vegetarian Options there is falafel, vegan beef and braised garden vegetables, falafel burger. There is a variety of different hummus to choose from (6) and many delicious lemonades/teas. Cucumber jalapeño, lavender/sage and original. I would definitely come here again if I’m ever in the area.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9N7UewT8ra_08bsdqS4uHA_muqBABiw_jzKZS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAkrzyQ9LgDzwqrG6KewwSB1_hknqZcSCMjoKb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlwRfOie64RfOd52K1RJLl_W51BkoJIj18RtQD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUtBrEjs8CVRUUMqNYDsuWdzJPm6DezR4cxbEp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< rating>

Some of the best Mediterranean food in the area. So many amazing vegan options! First Mediterranean place I’ve seen with a vegan option that’s not falafel (the falafel is amazing too). This place offers all the best things about good Mediterranean food, but with some creative tweaks—fun flavors of hummus and tahinis, interesting topping choices. Highly recommend!<//text>

We went there twice and I'd visit any time again. You can put together your own pita, bowl or baguette, choosing from a wide range of ingredients which make up a very filling, big meal. You get so much for your money, it's amazing! And it's so tasty at the same time. I'm amazed by this place as it offers such great food for less money. 100% recommendation!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

For all the health conscious people around, this is the place to visit. Design your own pitas or a bowl full of some veggies and proteins, they have a vegan option also. Every food here is absolute delight. Loved the food very much...must visit<//Review>

So damn good and good for you. The falafel is perfectly crispy. The lemonades are sweet and tasty. Everything tastes impossibly fresh.  The ambiance inside is very nice but there is very little seating.<//text>

<Review>Very tasty pita! I mean I chose what went in, but that doesn't mean it wasn't fresh and yummy. I was tempted to take off a star because the music was really loud, but I get it, weekends around all those corporate buildings can't be very busy. Worth a go if you're in the area.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2b6b70f26d04f:0x37bd71e3ba9f15e9< /GmapID><rate>5<//rate>< Response>

They also have a wide variety of choices of proteins, toppings and dips. Also, the line may look long but it moves fast.

<text>It’s being near to some of the offices, makes a perfect place for Lunch in El Segunado area.

They have prepare your own menu concept to select bread, hummus, protein, stuffing and sauce.

Their Falafel are the best and I recommend every time you have lunch. Good part is anytime you go, the wait time will not be more than 5-10mins. That’s how the Efficient their process is.

They do offer some juices and other snack items and the portion is perfect for the lunch. I visit this place whenever I visit LA area for work<//text>< Pics>

<Name>Zirah Amari<//Name><Review>Not what I was expecting. If you are looking for middle eastern food, this is not that type of place.  You can order a bowl, salad or a wrap. Mostly vegetarian options but has a few proteins to choose from. If you pick the steak as an option  its an extra 1.50.   Might be a good dining option for vegetarians.</Review><rating>1</rating><pics>None< /pics><time>1504701288670< /time>< Resp>

This place is delicious. It’s like a Mediterranean Chipotle but a million times better. I met my girlfriend for lunch here and had the chicken shawarma bowl. It was amazing. She went with the vegan beef and said it was excellent. I highly recommend this place!</Text>

Great option for people who have specific dietary needs. You can choose exactly what you want in a bowl, pita, or salad. The options allow for Paleo, low carb, high fat, low fat, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, GERD, or anti-inflammatory diets. And it's delicious. With a drink, total meal cost is under $15.</Text>

Be choosy on your toppings. I originally hated this place as I would ask therm to put almost all the toppings on. It is such a bad mix of so many flavors and textures as the whole thing became repulsive. If you get the spreads on the side and put a few toppings that go together well, it actually tastes much better.</review>

<review>The park is very simple, small, and very family oriented - nothing special.  But the two "coaches" on staff (Coach Heather and Coach Eric) are AWESOME - the ABSOLUTE BEST.  My kids love them, and they (my kids) are really learning not only how to play sports, but the real value of sportsmanship.  This is SO MUCH BETTER than the hyper competitive world of AYSO, with pushy parents and high pressure coaches.  This place is GREAT, and I give it my highest possible recommendation.< /review><userid>117024914821519966535< /userid><response>None< /response><Date>1494535246246< /Date><user_name>Benjamin Zuckerman<//user_name></record>

Best care around town. Always friendly and attentive to our family. Dr.Wikoff and his staff always have the best hospitality when coming into the office. We need more doctors and staff like his office in the field of health.</Review>

After two weeks of care, I can honestly say that I made the right decision to come and receive treatment at Back to Life Chiropractic. I appreciate that Dr. Wikof took the time to explain my treatment plan thoroughly. I can not say enough good things about the customer service of this office. Everyone in the office is wonderful and welcoming. Thank you, Taryn, for always making sure that I'm comfortable during my PT.  I'm now able to sleep through the night and not waking up because of the pain.</text>

I laugh because I told my friend who referred me there he cracked me like a walnut. I was having pain in my lower leg after the adjustment is subsided a bit where I can sit. I’m going back for a decompression this afternoon I am so thankful to God that my friend Lupe referred me to this awesome Dr his staff was very professional and caring.

Back to life is a great place for all your chiropractic needs.  The staff are kind and courteous and Dr. Wikoff takes the time to pay attention to your needs.  If you just need a quick adjustment or for long term care, they have all the tools and programs to help you out.  My two accidents did a number to my neck and they have helped me in the best way possible! Highly recommend them and I have recommended them to others who like their service!!</Text>

I am beyond blessed to have found Dr.Brian
I completely whiplashed my lower back the first weekend of January while sledding (flew off a 6ft mountain) and landed right on my butt. I waited it out for a month thinking it would magically fix itself - wrong. 4 weeks in I wasn't able to comfortably walk, getting up and out of bed was difficult. I couldn't even go to the gym any more.
After my first visit/adjustment I was able to walk with way less pain and after the 2nd and 3rd visit the pain is almost ALL gone. I can't wait to finish my treatment and be normal again!
I 100/10 recommend him, the best!< /Review>

Dr. Wikoff and his staff are amazing! I came to him for Webster chiropractic adjustments to try to flip my breech baby. I was already over 37 weeks and my little one was stubborn and wouldn't flip even after an ECV. Dr. Wikoff is warm and personable and I felt comfortable with him immediately. He truly cares about his patients! Check out the card the entire staff signed with personal messages after my baby girl was born...so sweet. My little girl never flipped but thanks to my many adjustments before she came I was able to deliver her naturally breech with no epidural! My labor was fast (4 hours) thanks to my body being in perfect alignment for birthing. She was born butt first and it was an easier labor than my son who was head first. A week after she was born she had her first appointment with Dr. Wikoff for an adjustment and she is doing great despite being breech for so long. He came highly recommended from my girlfriend and I'm so glad she referred me to him. I have a chiropractor for life!< /Review>

I had a pinched nerve in my neck that was sending an extreme amount of pain up to my head making it unbearable to work or sleep. After 3 visits to Dr. Wykoff, the issue had been resolved and I was pain free. The staff are wonderful to work with and keep a very clean environment. There is always a positive vibe in the building, like everyone there loves to help heal.</text>

Been coming here for about 2 years now & always feel welcome, Dr Wickoff and his staff are amazing, they also have a massage therapist too if you're interested

When I initially came in I had a minor case of scoliosis but Brian helped quell any anxiety I had and payment plans are flexible whether you do/don't have insurance

Highly suggest this place if you're looking for a chiropractor to call home</Review>

Doctor Wikoff and the Back to Life Family Chiropractic team are amazing. The doctor is successfully helping me get movement and eliminate pain in my neck, back and hips. He uses a wide variety of techniques and a drop table which is particularly effective on my lower back and hip. The doctors is also helping my daughter with her scoliosis. The early results are positive and there is a reduction in my daughter's back pain.< /Review>

Dr. Wikoff and his staff are so awesome. I'll admit that on my first visit I thought this was just going to be another bad experience for the books. I've treated with a couple other chiros in the past and I honestly never felt any difference. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised! Dr. Wikoff is so knowledgeable and knew exactly how to start addressing my injuries immediately and get me on the path to feeling great again.

I also referred my husband, who suffered multiple injuries while serving in the USMC. He has been in pain for many years and Dr. Wikoff is the only doctor who has been able to get him some relief IMMEDIATELY! He walked out of there speechless because after 4 years he finally started to feel some sensation in his right leg. I honestly have nothing, but amazing things to say about Dr. Wikoff.

Thank you Dr. Wikoff - from the bottom of my heart!< /Review>

I was recommended to this facility by my son and his wife.  When I arrived at my first visit  I was a little overwhelmed by such a large crowd.  I filled out my questionnaire/form and immediately I was taken care of.
They placed me in a special area/room , away from everyone to feel safe.
When I finally met the Dr. W. I could sense why he had so many patients.
He is very professional, but above all goes above and beyond to meet the needs of the patient with lots of empathy and listens to every concern.<//review>

Brian is the best chiropractor I have been to. I have had the need of chiropractic care due to a sports injury for the last 25 years. Brian is thorough and consistent. He strives to keep up on the latest techniques. He makes it possible for me to stay active and exercise.<//Review>

I’ve been seeing Back to Life Chiropractic care for about a year during and after serving in the military. I had serious headaches and upper back and shoulder pain from numerous daily task I was assigned. Doc has helped my should strength come back and fix up my back so my back pain has almost vanished from the first time I came in. Thanks to him and his team I’ve been using Physical therapy and his methods to get back what I lost. As soon as you walk in the door to smiling faces you know they will take care of your problems, thank you doc and your team!< /Review>

<review>My first time ever going to a chiropractor and a bit nervous about the whole thing. But upon going in the staff was very friendly and accommodating which put me a little more at ease.  Then I met Dr Wickoff and he not only told me what he was going to do but educated me on my condition. How he can help my situation and what I can do to improve it. Once I am in the know I was no longer nervous at all. Dr. Wickoff is a knowledgeable  and passionate about his profession.
I would recommend him and his staff to anyone that needs it.
Look forward to the next visit because each time I improve my spine and my mind.
Thank you Back to Life Chiropractic.< /review><Date>1593279140917</Date></record>

I highly recommend Dr. Wicoff.   I came to him a week ago and could barely walk.   I was in horrible pain and simply could not do anything to get comfortable.   I week later I feel like a new man.   He's an outstanding doctor with incredible team. His office staff are exceptional as well.   I am extremely lucky to have found Back to Life Family Chiropractic.</Text>

Hands down the best chiropractor experience. Completely felt the Dr. Was so knowledgeable and I completely felt he was in the interest of his costumers needs and not their money. Completely humble and caring.  I will bring my whole family in the future, if I could give it more starts I would.</text>

Dr. Wikoff is so knowledgeable and made me feel so comfortable. The adjustment was amazing, I immediately felt relief in my lower back. Will most definitely will be back regularly and hopefully I can get my son on board with getting adjusted! I love that this place is super family oriented and accommodating to the little ones.

His energy fills the office and so does everyone else working there! Very family oriented. I had surgery on my lower back from a herniated disk, before ever knowing anything about Back To Life, I was trying to recover but something just felt off. I've never been to too many chiropractors prior, just one. Dr. Wikoff, took an X-ray my first visit and let me talk to him when they were closed to see my x-ray and go over it. Apparently my back AND neck were in bad shape. After a couple months of going there 2 or 3 days in the week I got better and better. STRONGER! Now I go in for maintenance like twice a month, and feel great! I skateboard now! I can't believe how bad my back used to be and how much better I've gotten! THANK YOU BACK TO LIFE!!!

I have been to many chiropractor’s since I was a child and Dr. Wikoff and his staff are by far superior to all of them. Dr. Wikoff truly listens to your concerns and can tell a lot from the x-rays he takes in house!! He also notices little things you forget to tell him if your body is a mess like mine. He is the only chiropractor to adjust my hand I have “nerve damage” in to give me some relief and has some crazy techniques I have never seen before that make your body feel great and get some relief also has good nutritional input he cares about your overall wellness besides what he can do from his expertise of setting the bone.</text>

<Review>Dr. Brian Wikoff and stuff are so far the best I experienced in Orange County! Granted, I met some other very good Chiropractors, but when I think on having need for adjustments, I hope and expect getting better after treatment.
In my experience I have gone through the yo-yo síndrome, and although the adjustments helped me so much, and saved me from awful experiences, I never cleared the threshold until I found an office in La Habra. They offered results from Subluxation neck misalignment, and helped me so much; however, could not work with my Insurance that paid them too little.
Heartbroken and concerned, after working so hard keeping treatments 3 times weekly, I had to find help somehow.
My sister who was good in research, from San Diego, looked for an office like the one in La Habra, and to our surprise there was not that many in OC, only 3!

Now, after a year of his and my hard work, I’m getting better! My neck is getting the curvature back, and my pain is no longer there as it was; very mild.
I think of the years I went for chiropractic care, and wondered if I really needed that many years, or if I just needed the right care.
Back to Life Chiropractic with Dr. Wikoff is definitely number 5+, the best for me!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Dr. Wikoff is great.  He takes the time to explain things and when hes done adjusting,  he can always tell if I had something going on that week and will ask me about it. We have been making our baby since he was 3 months because he was getting colicky.  He has been a very happy baby since his treatment has started.</review>

Knowledgeable, caring and extremely generous with his time.
Staff is very sweet and professional.  We drive along ways to get the best in chiropractic care.
He is treating  my 80 year old mother for scoliosis and in 11 treatments she has had a drastic change.
Thank you Dr. Brian!</Text>

<text>Amazing Chiropractor and wonderful, caring staff.
Dr Wikoff is TRULY an excellent Chiropractor. He really helps people get “Back to Life” .
I have had extreme pain in my legs for quite some time now. Medical Dr’s just want to give me pain meds to mask pain and cover up the root cause (because they can’t find the cause).
Not Dr Wikoff! He listens, exams and treats the CAUSE causing my pain, (Lower back disk problem). I am already feeling better, walking better and on my way “Back to (my) Life!”
THANK YOU DR WIKOFF!< /text></record></dataset><record>

I brought in my three month-old daughter in because of colic and reflux. We are now off medication and doing so much better! I was hesitant bringing in my baby because she was so small, but the doctor was so confident and patient, that it made it so much easier. My adjustments have reduced my headaches and hip pain. I have been to chiropractors for most of my life and have never felt so good when leaving an office. I highly recommend. Great staff and clean office.</text>

Dr. Brian is the best chiropractor, I walked in bent over and walked out straighter. He is upfront and honest.
I’ve known this doctor more than 15 years and would not go to any other chiropractor.
My regret is not seeing him on a continuing bases.<//review>

<Date>1532061937930</Date><Review>Friendly staff, busy office but they get you in and out relatively fast. Dr. Wikoff is thorough and explains that he's doing and why. He didn't just drag you in and manipulate you, but rather looks at x-rays  and comes up with a treatment plan that could some weight, stretching, and recommendations to continue your recovery or relief from anything from back pain to indigestion. He's very personable and tries to make every visit relevant listening to what you're feeling and coming up with ways to improve your health. A++ for Dr. Wikoff and his team.</Review>< user_name>

<Text>About half way through my treatment and I already feel so much better I'm able to stand for longer periods of time at work and getting actual sleep I wake up feeling reenergized and ready for the day! I recommend to pay for treatment all at once and get a MAJOR discount plus the physical therapy! I really enjoy coming here nothing but smiles from the staff! Dr. Wickoff has been in the profession for many years and know what he is doing. He really does enjoy bringing his clients Back to Life!< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
When I first came into Dr. Wikoff’s office I was a broken man. I was out of a job and out of money.  I needed a walker or crutches to be able to walk and couldn’t do anything without somebody’s help. I just felt useless. I was living off of muscle relaxers to help keep my back pain away because the doctor had told me that the only way to fix it was with surgery. But I hadn’t lost my faith. My amazing aunt and uncle had told me about a chiropractor that they trusted very much and offered to pay and to help bring me to my appointments. They told me to just have faith that I was going to get better. When Dr. Wikoff showed me my X-Ray results I wasn’t expecting for my back to be so messed up. I ended up having a dislocated disc pinching on my sciatic nerve and my spine was misaligned. The doctors had told me that surgery was the only solution but Dr. Wikoff assured me that he was going to do everything he could to make sure that didn’t happen. I stopped taking my muscle relaxers so I could notice if there was a change in my pain levels. I can honestly say that in about a week I no longer needed them at all. Slowly but surely I was able to walk longer distances without my back hurting so much. I began to have hope that I would be able to start working again and that I was going to be able to walk without limping or without any discomfort. Twelve sessions later, it was as if a miracle happened. My back was strong again. I was able to get a job and I felt like I was truly going to be okay. I am extremely grateful to be able to have met Dr. Wikoff and his team. I would like to thank Tanya for helping me through my decompression sessions and for always asking to see how I felt after every visit. I would like to thank Melissa for helping me with any questions I had regarding my appointments or insurance or pretty much any question I had in general. I would also like to thank Kaitie and Stacey for always welcoming me with a smile and for also helping me schedule my next appointment. And lastly I would like to thank the man who was able to get me back on my feet and working in less time than I thought would take. I have so much to thank Dr. Wikoff for. He was able to prove that surgery is not the only solution. I was afraid that I might not be able to work anywhere but an office for the rest of my life. But thanks to Dr. Wikoff and his team I am now working 10-12 hour shifts in a soccer complex park that requires me to move around all day long and I am able to do it with no pain at all :) If it hadn’t been for my aunt and uncle and for Dr. Wikoff and his team I’m not sure in what condition I would be in today. Thank you guys for bringing me back to life! I am forever grateful :)< /Review>

Then I heard your story and that's when I started praying for you and your future.   I am so thankful that your Aunt and Uncle sent you here. Many doctors rush to surgery and some give up completely on people and write never ending RX's for pain medication, I think we all know how that ends up. During your exam and seeing the x-rays as well as reading the MRI's I knew exactly what we had to do... fix the bone that caused the disc to herniate and fix the disc too, then get you moving again and doing some exercises specific to your job duties and boom! Back to Life and Back to Work:)\nYou're an awesome guy and thank you for the trust and confidence along the way."}<//Resp>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>My family and I have been patients of Dr. Wikoff for 15 years I can honestly say I don’t know what we would do without him.
There are four people in our family, and I think the best way to describe how extraordinary he is as a chiropractor and a person is to explain how different our individual treatment needs are, and how gifted he is at finding them, often before we even tell him what we are feeling, which is an incredible gift, and then how he treats and cures the issues.
To begin, I have suffered from severe migraine headaches since I was in 5th grade. I am 51 years old now. I see Dr. Wikoff regularly, if I was truly consistent and actually went once a week, I would have far fewer than I do. My issue is my neck and my hormones. Dr. Wikoff is the only chiropractor that I have ever seen that can find my problem area, adjust me accordingly, and take away a migraine that I have been in bed with, in a dark room, treating with medication for 3 days! No other chiropractor has EVER been able to help my headaches. I also see him for maintenance, and he will ask, “Hey is your stomach upset, or are you experiencing any vertigo, any pain behind your left eye, etc.” Every time my answer is yes to a diagnosis that I never told him I was having an issue with. That is a God given gift that he unequivocally has!

My husband competes in Ironman races and he sees Dr. Wikoff for maintenance every few weeks, and also for an issue with one of his knees that flares up when he gets closer to the race as his run distance increases. Without Dr. Wikoff, he would not be able to complete these races that he loves so much because of his knee. The adjustments are minor, but they make all the difference!!!

Next, we have 2 daughters that Dr. Wikoff has been seeing since they were 7 and 9 years old. They now both live in Texas, and I am not kidding....as soon as we get their bags at baggage claim in Orange County, we drive straight to see Dr. Wikoff at Back to Life Chiropractic!!! Dallas has some great chiropractors, but they both say no one compares to Dr. Wikoff. He has treated my older daughter, who is now 24, off and on for the past 15 years. She was in a car accident at age 17 and had a few adjustments, some massages and some electric stimulation. She occasionally gets headaches now from working at a computer all day, and Dr. Wikoff takes those away. During her elementary and high school years she sustained minor strains from sports and he always treated them effectively and she was as good as new in no time.

My younger daughter, who is now 22, is probably the most amazing testament to Dr. Wikoff’s gifts as a chiropractor. She suffered from mild asthma after contracting RSV as an infant. Her lungs were just weak, and every time she got a cold it went straight to her lungs and she lived on the nebulizer with breathing treatment 3-4 times a day. When Dr. Wikoff started treating her at age 7, he would adjust her “breathing bone” in her upper back, (: and I am not kidding you, that asthma went away!!!! For my daughter, and our family, that was, and still is, a miracle that only Dr. Wikoff can make happen! She went on to play volleyball and run track, and I know she never could have done those things without Dr. Wikoff!!!

So.....if you are looking for the best of the best...if you believe that God gives some people gifts to do things that others cannot, and you want to be treated by a doctor who is kind, supportive, gifted, intelligent, loves God, loves his family, and is also SO fun and full of life....then Dr. Wikoff is the chiropractor for you! Also, the warm and thoughtful staff at Back to Life are second to none!!!! They make you feel like family.

Best of luck on your journey to a healthier, pain free life. Start here with Dr. Wikoff and see if he can help you as much as he has helped the four of us.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1559257918634, 'text': "Kacie,\nThank you so much for the super nice words and reflection over the years.

I have so loved being your families chiropractor and to see the girls grow and go has been my gift from God. I am blessed to be involved in your's and Mike's life.

<Review>Back to life chiropractic has changed my family's life. Dr Wikoff has a real gift. Through regular treatment he has drastically improved my wife's depression and overall health.

We've been to other chiropractors before, but they never really seem to be interested in anything more than giving a quick "crack". Dr. Wikoff actually acts like a Doctor. Actually that's an insult. He is a healer.

He starts with x rays to actually see what your spine looks like. Makes sense right? How can you adjust a spine properly if you haven't even seen it? After the initial x rays and consultation, he sets up a treatment plan that will best heal your spine.

My spine is a ok, so he only recommended 1 adjustment per month to maintain it and work on one disk that is not quite right. For my wife, he recommended adjustment and physical therapy 3 times a week for 3 to 9 months. So, as you can see he treats every patient as an individual. The reason my wife needs so much treatment is because her spine is literally twisted and the curve in her neck is reversed.

After 2 months of treatment, she actually "feels like a human being again".

As for me, Brian has greatly improved my restless leg and keeps me in great shape for my extremely physical job which is basically the equivalent of Olympic weight lifting!

I would never go to another chiropractor. If you are in pain, please do yourself a favor and see Dr Wikoff. Your body will thank you later.</Review><UserId.>109182597783865471945< /UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>5<//Rate>< username>

I have been getting adjusted by Dr. Wikoff now for 5 years & I have been very satisfied with his care. I feel fortunate be taken care of by the Back to Life Chiropractic team and I'm in better health because of having been taken care of by such a knowledgable Chiropractor. Dr. Brian will make you feel better and his warm & friendly staff makes visiting his office a pleasure. Stacy, the Office Manager also will make any insurance challenges efforless, as my wife is also a patient after sustaining injuries due to a car accident. Dr. Wikoff also helped her in completely eleviating her vertigo!

Feel comfortable knowing you are in great hands!< /Text>

< Review>
I am 64 years old and have been a patient of Dr. Brian Wikoff’s for 22 years due to chronic symptoms related to compressed and bulging discs in my lower back and my neck.  I have also been diagnosed as having moderate osteoarthritis in those areas as well.  I was very active as an athlete and distance runner beginning in junior high school and continuing through my active duty service in the US Marine Corps up through my mid-thirties.  I also have worked for years at a time as a carpenter and construction worker beginning at age 19.  My active lifestyle has definitely taken a toll on the health of my spine.
I cannot say enough about the huge benefits to my health and well-being, pain management, and overall lifestyle of continuing regular chiropractic treatment.  I rarely use over the counter pain medications anymore (aspirin, Aleve, Tylenol, etc.), and I’m certain my liver and other internal organs appreciate that.  I do experience moderate pain and discomfort at times; however, with weekly adjustments from Dr. Wikoff, they do not have any debilitating effect on my life.  I work full time and I exercise regularly.  I have seen several other chiropractors and physical therapists over the years and can state without reservations that Dr. Wikoff’s professional expertise as a chiropractor is the absolute best, and that the ongoing effectiveness of his care is head and shoulders above those others.

< review>
This allergy girl loved the food eventually... after making it clear that I was allergic to lemon I got my tacos without the sauce which had lemon but as it was being set down the waiter said out loud here’s your food without the sauce but wait the chicken is marinated in lemon. Epic fail. They did redo it and bring sweet potato hash to hold me over. I highly recommend the hash.<//review>

<Review>Not inexpensive, but very solid.  Dependable, cheerful efficient service.  Atmosphere is pleasant, seating is typically available and quick.  PLUS, unlike Urth Cafe, Superba (on Arroyo Parkway) .... they OFFER YOU JAM AND CONDIMENTS WITH YOUR TOAST WITHOUT nickle-and-diming you with extra charges.< /Review>< rating>

<text>The food is delightful, but they charge a table service for coffee and then still ask for a tip. This is something often done in Europe, where tipping isn’t custom. You get one or the other-not both-and the fact that this isn’t posted anywhere is kinda sleezy.<//text>< GmapID>

< Review>
This was my first visit to La Pain, but it will not be my last! I had a very pleasant experience and tasty meal ( I chose the chicken and mozzarella tartine). Jessica, my server, was a friendly and helpful young lady. As a creature of habit I tend to go to the same places continually, this will now be one of them.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><resp>None< /resp><text>I had Belgian waffle and apple juice for kids. Quite surprised apple was fresh squeezed and waffle was crisp outside and soft inside. Oh BTW apple juice for kids was free~~ Organic jam was especially delicious.

For adults first of all coffee!! Very fresh and feels like it was hand dripped. Ordered OM with tomato and avocado and bowl of warm salad. OM was very soft and tasty. no juice from tomato was dripping. Salad was fresh and French bread was extra ordinary. Warm salad felt super healthy taste?

I do love this chain. This one had good service and the usual great breakfast menu a bit on the pricy side for some items. The hot chocolate is my favorite, you are given hot steamy milk then you get to add the dark chocolate syrup to your liking.</Review>

The food was a bit bland in my opinion. I ordered the Banana French Toast and my partner ordered the mini pancakes. The serving sizes were small, and the flavor was as well, while the price seems to be higher than warranted. I also has to wait far too long to receive service at my table. I had noticed my other walked in before me had ordered taken, and received food even before I had my drink order.  Overall, I don't buy into the trendy hype.</Text>

Great food, delightful people, warm friendly environment! They are schooled regarding Trained Service Dogs and the non-service dogs are allowed on the front patio area. Highly recommend their delicious food, breads (gluten free is amazing!), drinks, and baked goods!  Cheers for making our neighborhood fabulous...<//review>

Nice options for specific dietary needs and preferences ie. vegan, dairy free, gluten free. The gluten free bread was a winner! 4 stars instead of 5 - I was served a sandwich on a croissant which, the menu described as on brioche. I was surprised, disappointed and sent it back. Opted for the Zucchini Pad Thai which was full of flavor. What would I change? Instead of whole cashews, pieces would be preferred.</text>

This place was surprisingly good for a chain. But it was a little expensive for breakfast. Maybe because their bread is so special, but I don't think it should cost $40 for 2 people for breakfast.</Text>

Amazing food choices. I came here for breakfast with a couple of friends and had the Belgain Waffle with Berries, Cold Brewed Coffee and their bread basket. They have a crazy assortment of delicious spreads. Must try it if you get a chance! My favorite was their Brunette (Belgian hazelnut praline spread).<//Text>

Le Pain is a reliable staple. Bread that is worthy of a carb binge. Fresh, well thought out and tasty seasonal menu with a relaxed vibe. Four stars as I feel the price point is too high, but the Belgian chocolate spread is num-num.<//Review>

The portions were terrible, the food itself was bland and uninspired, and they charged enormous prices for everything, including oatmeal. Say what you want about organic avocados and meats, but I challenge anyone to justify 10 dollars for a cup of oatmeal smaller than their water glasses.

I guess if you enjoy organic food priced way above what it needs to be, then this place is for you, but I can think of a whole lot of other places that do very healthy, tasty options at a fraction of the price.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>This Le Pain location is by far the worst. I felt uneasy, as if my business wasn't wanted. The cashier did not acknowdge me, perhaps because I was the only Mexican American in her line of vision. Once my order was prepared to go, the cashier did not want to hand me the food herself. She called on a kitchen assistant and instructed him to hand the food to me, all while I was standing NOT TWO FEET in front of her. Would much rather make a drive to the Beverly Hills location, where service is not discriminatory.

<review>Generally I find the Pasadena location to lack the impeccable customer service of the Melrose and Claremont locations, but it's still an LPQ with all the amazing salads, tartines, and desserts you love. Favorites: black bean tartine, lentil salad, almond meringue. Coffee and tea are top notch too, they really put a great deal of care into there ingredients, both on sustainability and taste.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Rich and healthy. Start with a bowl of Greek yogurt and then a ham and gouda croissant. Like a sandwich with bacon, avocado, egg and cheese. Excellent attention and recommended at the end of the parade of the roses

(Translated by Google) The person who served us I think is Jerry a little thin young smiling really nice he had to go on break, he was too nice (his colleague cash us) we took coffee chocolate pancake orange juice and salmon omelette . It was rather a shame that the rest of the team is not so smiling !!!

(Original)
La personne qui nous a servi je crois est Jerry un petit jeune mince souriant vraiment très agréable  il a dû partir en pause , il était trop sympa ( son collègue nous encaisser) nous avons pris du café chocolat pancake jus d’orange et omelette au saumon . C’était plutôt bon dommage que le reste de l’équipe ne soit pas aussi souriante !!!< /review>

<review>Went to this Burger King at 8 am on a Friday. They didn’t have hash browns. The cashier suggested fries as a substitution, but charged me the fry price instead of hashbrown sized prices. They didn’t even have French toast sticks. Does nobody order supplies for this store? Disappointed.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Burger King on Bardsley is one of our favorite places, especially in the winter because it's cold or rainy we can spend 5$ and just chill in the kids zone while my son plays with other kids. They do always forget his dipping sauce in his kids meal though, every time we go I have to ask for it but it doesn't bother me. If we drove through though yeah that would suck so check your bags.<//Text>

<review>Delicious! Burger King never let's me and my stomach down! I love visiting all  Burger King restaurants near me, but this location certainly is the best, it has the best  customer service and they are the nicest employees. Definitely recommend any Burger King, but this one is my favorite. Check this place out!< /review></record>

<text>Im not one to give a review ever, but I feel I have to. My friends went to this place yesterday Sunday 09/17/2017 they said they had a horrible experience, service was horrible and the employees were rude and even denied them from a cup for water. I told them I was going and they told me not to because of their experience I still went the next day 09/18/2017 I asked for what you see in The receipt I asked for no pickles and still got pickles I asked for ranch for my daughters nuggets and got  absolutely no sauce I went drive thru my friends were walk-ins. Point is if you are paying for a service they should at least give you what you are paying for!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80952b71ce777db3:0x6b378ba2b908ff6<//Gmap_id><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5ehw1NkubFr3YnqMQUitDzdaMDZSvoxyeYMqb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3sPnXuzU2oBSfy1sHfcya6cMjekrVR_2jgZ_d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Name>

Every time I go to the Burger King drive-thru they always have a hard time getting my order right even though I speak clearly and precisely every time I do it in a different ethnicity and they never get it right they need new microphones or something or they need to hire people that are less dense. #whopper< /Text>

The employee  that help me she had a bad attitude I under stand she was probably having a bad day don’t take it out on me so I asked for her name and she said why I am not going to give you my name . So I asked to speak to the manager and the manager said ok I’ll talk to her. Manager got next to her And said some I am sure she didn’t say nothing about her changing her attitude . So the employee removed her mask to make sure I saw that she was laughing what ever the manager said to her.</text>

< Review>
I'm a local and I have noticed the super long lines...and today stopped for breakfast with my kids in the drive thru and the wait is ridiculous. This took longer than in n out and it was in total almost 40 minute wait for our food..I'm wondering why its taking longer now when there aren't customers ordering inside 😒  just terrible.</Review>

<review>We continue to have problems with out order at drive thru.  Most of the time there is an item missing, today there was two, on top of it all, they don't answer the phone.  I think this location has a management issue.   Warning check your entire order before you leave.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Employees at this store do not listen to customers at all , especially when a customer is requesting split payments. As walking into the store from issues at drive thru at this store employees are talking smack about a customer. No apologies were given to the customer for their mistakes. And Jennie lies and tells customers that she is the GM which clearly she doesn’t know anything about customer service. Never ever go to this store!!!! You will sit in long 20-30 min long lines and food is never correct and customer service is horrible.</Review>

Service was fast and friendly . But no soda and no 1/4 lbs burgers . It was Christmas night @ 8pm . But that's ok . I have only eaten Burger King one other time and let's just say it wasn't  a great experience.  This time the food was hot and fresh  love them cheese tots .. and the bacon burger .< /Review>

<text>It was good. They were pretty quick at getting all our items to us and taking our order as well. I didnt go inside so I'm not sure on the atmosphere. The service was as expected quick and accurate</text>< user_id>

<review>I tried to order on the app and it glitched on me and erased my order. The staff at the restaurant were very friendly and helpful. Got my order in and out to me in under 5 minutes.

One thing I have to say is I know that everyone has their issues right now but when someone is ordering at the drive thru if you dont like that the order was changed for one item Make sure your mike is off the sigh of frustration in your voice doesn't help, the person on the other end may be having a bad day as well</text>

This location is great! Big screens with games at the tables, a beautiful kids area with a huge chalkboard wall, and of course great BK food. Was a great stop on our road trip.<//review>

I really liked some of the staff here, but hate the food and the unclean areas. Kids have sticky fingers that get on everything. Its hard to maintain but the staff needs to clean more. Food is just not as fresh as other fast food places. Its average.<//Text>

Been here several times burgers are always good customer service is a bit lacking but what do you expect at a fast food joint so as long as my burger my fries in my drink are good I'm good to go it's usually fast fairly clean. It's right off the freeway as well</review>

3rd visit in a month and every time the order has errors aswell as i have to repeat my orders multiple times over the speakerbox as the employees do not appear to be very attentive.
Other than that parking lot and in store is usually very clean. Minimal wait period as location is not heavily trafficked</text>

Out of ice cream or ice cream machine doesn't work, french frys under cooked & way to salty & now selling expired food! Just bought to Hershey Sundae Pies & both were expired, they are dated 3/3/16 (Note: Today is 5/2/16), also for kid's meal's you have to request a toy instead of there nasty chocolate chip cookies.

<Text>This place is crazy on the wait time. I waited in the drive thru line for 30 mins then when we got home we realized that the chicken nuggets we ordered wasn't even fully cooked. I was and still am so mad. The place is ridiculous on the waiting time! Cant stress that enough!. They need more workers or management needs to improve on wait time. I've never worked in fast food before but if other places can get you out in a timely fashion then so can burger king!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<name>Vanessa Miranda<//name><time>1546105052489<//time><Rate>1</Rate><text>Went to Burger King through the drive thru at 11:30pm and they close at 12am. They turned off all the lights and when I received my food, my large fries looked like small fries. They probably didn’t have enough fries but instead of cooking more or telling me they only had enough for a small fries, they still charged me and screwed up the order a bit more. If y’all close at 12am I’m guessing that would mean you start cleaning at 12am, not rushing to leave at 12am. Smh.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The service was good but the food was ok. I have the egg McMuffin. Couldn't finish it. The little potatoes bites were real salty.<//review>

<Text>It's sad to say that the food here had gone down hill over the past 10 , the king is rolling over in his grave at the sad state his food is in. The burgers are smaller and more expensive and put togather like a 5 year old trained some 4 year olds how to make burgers.  Will not be returning.< /Text>< Pictures>

Got order wrong. Food was borderline cold, lukewarm at best. Fries tasted like they had been refried several times.</text>

Very friendly staff but my Wooper had more mayo on top of the bun and wrapper than it had inside the burger.   Pretty sloppy burger maker.< /Review>

<Review>The bread is very dry. The last time I went through the drive through the employees were arguing about the supply of coupons they had and how they have to be stingy with then cuz that was the only box they get until 2019. I found that very unprofessional. The food is just terrible except for the nuggets and fries.<//Review></record>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>(Translated by Google) It is almost always fine but today I asked for ketchup for 3 orders and they refused to give me the one I needed they told me that they only gave me the one they wanted and very reluctantly, it is a man who gives the orders at the entrance. And neither did he give me the complete order, terrible service from that person.

Casi siempre esta bien pero hoy pedí ketchup para 3 órdenes y me negaron darme la que necesitaba me dijeron que solo me davan la que ellos querían y de muy mala gana, es un hombre que da las órdenes en la entrada. Y tampoco me dió la orden completa pésimo servicio el de esa persona.<//review>< pics>
