Antoinette was SO awesome and Dr. Fait as well. The entire team from reception to cleaning, to consult with the doctor were so friendly, professional, and helpful.

Thank you all for being so accommodating. I’d recommend to anyone who’s looking for a great dental office 😊😊< /Text>

My family and I love coming here!! My husband and I grew up with Dr. Fait on Catalina Island, in fact, he and I were in the same class in elementary school😉 So when we heard he had opened a practice in Long Beach, literally 10 minutes from the boat, we just had to go see him ☺️ Living on Catalina Island and having to come to the mainland for dental work can be pretty difficult. We have to make sure we can get all appointments done in time to make a scheduled boat back home to the island and they are amazing at making sure that happens. It definitely helps having a Dr. that actually knows how it works and understands that. The office is clean, they explain everything in detail, come up with different options to best suit your needs, whether it's financially, physically, time wise, whatever it is, they go above and beyond to make it happen. Everyone is SUPER nice and helpful, everyone goes out of their way to make sure patients are as comfortable as possible, even while waiting on the waiting room. I HIGHLY recommend coming here to anyone that will listen. And Dr. Fait is AWESOME!! Super helpful, always makes sure you're comfortable and that your needs are met. Can't say it enough, LOVE coming here!!</text>

I really like this dentist. I have to have a bunch of cavities filled and my husband needs extensive work done.... he comes  in Saturday’s because we live on Catalina island and work makes it difficult to go over town during weekdays. He is so flexible  and nice- all the staff is accommodating and pleasant. I appreciate them all so much because I am not always the easiest patient</text>

Upon entering Dr Faits office it feels like home, staff greet you with care sensitivity and efficiency. Dentist visits unnerve me though I was quickly met with care, and dignity of working it through to degree I now have a new view of dental work. The modern technology used, and accuracy of care made my dental work a wonderful experience, which included deep cleaning, along with crown and bridge. Wonderful experience, highly recommend Dr Fait and his amazing staff!!< /review>

Dr Fait was a really cool and nice guy and explained all of my options and what he recommends or doesn't recommend.   Everyone in the office was nice and accommodating.  Dr Fait even offered to give me a prescription anti-biotic for a small infection I had on the tooth.  A lot of people don't like to visit the dentist and some dentists can treat you like just another patient.  I didn't get that impression at all on my visit.  The office itself was nice, high tech, and very clean.   Plenty of parking and easily accessible right off the 405 Freeway.   I highly recommend a visit to Dr Fait for any of your dental needs.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Very prompt, professional, courteous, and friendly. My follow-up appointment was scheduled for 9:20 am. I arrived there about 5 minutes early. I barely sat down before my name was called. I had everything taken care of and I was on my way home by 9:40! If you're looking for a dentist, I highly recommend Dr. Fait.<//text>

<Review>This experience with Dr. Fait literally changed my life.  My smile is amazing and I do not have any gaps anymore.  He and Sam went all out and I would recommend them to anyone.  They made me feel super comfortable during a long procedure.<//Review>< pictures>

Following my last pregnancy I had many unresolved issues with my teeth. Dr. Fait was wonderful answering every question, and addressing each need. I felt comfortable throughout each examination and procedure. His staff was warm and attentive. Overall couldn’t have had a better experience with a dental office.<//Text>

<text>Very accommodating, tries to fit me in with short notice.  Dental office updated to latest technology.  Digital X-rays saves time, allows better views/details of concerned areas.  Dr. Fait shows genuine concern/empathy for patients, taking time to listen, and explain necessary procedures.<//text>< Pictures>

One of the best experiences at a Dentist office. I was concern about my tooth chipping occasionally and wasn’t ready for a crown on my tooth. Dr. Fait gave me some other great options. He listen to my concern and that means a lot to me. Thanks Doc.<//Review>

I live in an area where it’s hard to get affordable and good dental. Received a recommendation to go and see Dr Fait and I am sure glad I did. Not once since I’ve been going have I felt Uncomfortable and his entire team makes u feel like family. He’s straight forward with you and with anything he can’t do, his recommendations have been wonderful too. I’m excited about my future visits with Dr Fait and staff. They’re amazing.<//text>< user>

Dr. Fait was top notch, best I've had. One thing that sets him apart is that he is not after my money, you know the "drill," trying to suck money out of you with unnessary treatments.

I was a long time patient with a doctor previously at this practice when Dr. Fait took over. It's always stressful to change long term doctor/patient relationships but Dr. Fait made the transition very easy. He does great work, uses the latest technology and is truly a nice guy!!  UPDATE: 03/15/2020. After further treatment I would like to emphasize just how comfortable it is to visit the doctor. He has installed televisions for his patients and is starting to use state of the art equipment that takes the pain and discomfort out of dentistry. I actually don’t fear the dentist any longer.</review>

< Review>
I couldn't be more grateful for Dr. Fait and his staff. I was in so much pain, and after calling several other Dentists with relatively good reviews, Dr. Fait's office was the only place that would see me same day.

Ashley was incredibly nice and helpful. When I called, she booked the earliest spot available for me despite the Doctor's extremely busy schedule.

As soon as I got there Dr. Fait was nice enough to numb the tooth right away so I could wait comfortably. I ended up needing a root canal and a crown, but the entire process was virtually pain free. I'm scheduled to return next week to get a full exam this time. I'm soooo glad I found this office! Thank you Dr. Fait!!!< /Review>

Dr. Fait walked me through each step as he was working on my tooth, he was so officiant. Love this office and I will definitely be back...hopefully with a routine cleaning this time .

I had a great experience in Dr. Fait's office.  It's clean and modern.  I can clearly see what he's talking about because the Xrays are displayed on a monitor next to the chair.  Doc is a Navy veteran, so we have that in common.  His assistant Sam put me at ease, and Dr. Fait has my complete trust.  Ashley cleaned my teeth and they feel great now.  She was very gentle, but thorough.  Highest recommendation to visit Dr. Fait's office.</review>

<Review>Didn't even want to give this product one star.
When I bought the "Tigon" stick vape (LESS THAN 2 WEEKS AGO!!), the juice tasted horrible.
Finally, as the juice started to taste decent...the stick broke, and the button is stuck. Completely stuck, inexplicably. Didn't drop it, didn't do anything to it.
I followed the warranty directions, sent the RMA form to exchange, and emailed them TWICE (because they have no actual customer service and the "Warranty Department" is by "email only"). The person at "customer service" just kept saying, I'm sure they'll respond to your email. It takes 24-48 hrs (it has now been over 5 days).

No store, no warranty department, and no way to contact someone who can actually help right this situation.  How convenient.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND THEIR PRODUCTS.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2970d5b55262b:0x8d771b9d083f3d3a<//gmapID></record>

I have been buying from them for years as a small vape supplier. Their website is very user friendly, also products are exceptionally good. Customer service is great, The shipping is quick and the products are packaged professionally.</text>

We have been working with Aspire for nearly a decade. Whether we get the product direct or from a distributor we have been proud to carry the brand. The quality is on a level where we seldom worry about product failure. We feel confident when we put an Aspire product in a customers hands.< /text>

<Review>Aspire has long been the gold standard in e-cig hardware. They constantly improve the products they bring to market, and the vast majority of the time the changes are made with the end user in mind. This particular location is the main hub and warehouse for distribution of their products in the US. Ive been to this location on several occasions and always found the experience a pleasant one. They have a large comfortable lobby and waiting area, and are usually happy to show you demo products or teach you how to use something if you arent familiar. They do get slammed sometimes, so call ahead if you want fast service.< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< Time>

Really wanted to like this place because it came highly recommended. Could be the dishes we ordered so might go back and try again. Had the chicken don, katsu don, curry chicken, seaweed salad and another noodle dish. Should have gotten the ramen because when it came by our table on the way to another table, it looked good. The don bowls were a little flavorless while the other dishes' flavors were too strong. The place was packed on a Friday night. Lots of upper grade school aged students there.   Service was slow but understandable that it's hard for 2 people to wait on a fully packed house.</Text>

<review>The food was good, and the service was nice. Tasty Japanese food options available, I had the katsu don bowl and my dining mate had a ramen with boiled egg.  The fried squid appetizer was also tasty, though my pic only represents one of 3 sticks, and it's partially eaten. They also served us a complimentary fried cheesy dish appetizer which was quite good.</review><date>1506573127494<//date><Response>None<//Response><userid>103811686658992731712<//userid>< Pictures>

<userid>100634688516050568952</userid><review>There are very few times that Yelp has led me down a wrong path and this is one of them. I'm not sure how this place receives an average 4 star rating. We ordered the ramen with spicy tonkatsu broth. You have to add each topping separately. Most ramen incorporates the spices to the soup base to make it spicy. When I received it, there was a layer of hot oil floating on top. The noodles tasted like the ramen noodles from a package. It has that same waxy exterior that is very distinctive. The signs of a good ramen is the noodle and the soup. Both failed. The egg was over cooked and the yolk had a grayish ring. The one redeeming thing is the minced pork. It was flavorful, but again on the dry side.

My husband ordered the General Tso's chicken.  The batter was light and crispy, but the chicken was super dry. The sauce was sweet without the spicy and tangy.< /review><Name>Stephanie Kua< /Name>< time>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Waitress/owner was very energetic and seemed to know most of the clients. We were here for the first time because I was craving katsudon. The meat was very tender, better worked than most other places. The onions were very undercooked on the other hand, so I didnt eat them. The ramen was good for a regular restaurant but we prefer the ramen served in ramen specific restaurants a lot more. All in all, a simple and nice spot for a meal.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6WUvFnNCfKAYNkSsAccndfEawB-ykwjnFEOHc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3RGx0LpsdnWoHEwoFH7dRCoTVfkiYPxlDTi9S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5odPmbYfbCc1dUG11ETWqkjz1ZqV9dqeJ9n7g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<Time>1575981282955< /Time><review>I've come back here numerous times and I've got to say that I think my rating has been too low.  The fact that they make a wonderful vegan noodle soup and you can modify it anyway you want is such a nice thing.  They also have done away with the free cream cheese dumpling and now serves you edamame for free is a much better option for me.  I love putting them in my soup to get more veggies.  I also love their eggplant you can add to your ramen.  It is so tender and tasty with the broth they serve it in.  Still don't really like the boiled cabbage with carrots as it's  pretty boring for $2.50 but last I asked they will bring you broccoli as a side.  I usually get the tofu as that is plentiful and really tasty with the soup.  As far as the noodles goes I love the Soba and pay the extra $.50 cents to get that versus the ramen noodles but both are excellent.  Lastly the service here is quite good and very friendly.  They are constantly refilling my glass with ice water.  Most places now only serve room temp water from a tap and I always hate that.  This is clean tasting water that is ice cold.  Would love for them to add a few more veggie dishes like maybe Yakisoba or a another tofu dish. But for now I'm ok just ordering my regular bowl of noodles and adding whatever I am in the mood for.  Oh and for Los Altos norms the prices are not all that bad either.  Glad to up my rating to reflect my most recent experiences.  Good Going Charley!<//review>< rate>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>Went for dinner at 7om on a Saturday and it was not very crowded. There was only server (I think she may be the owner?) but she was quick and attentive to all the parties. This place must have frequent regulars because in down-moments, she was chatting up different groups in a manner suggesting she knew them well. The place is clean and the service was fast.

I got the ramen with tonkotsu broth and added in the shoyu egg (seasoned egg). The ramen was very good but the egg was disappointing. Whatever dish my friend got he liked very much.

I would definitely try this place again and recommend it to friends.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGvlpbQPp0CqhH5bzIgEW8_53vZA8qJo9VseU_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqYrgijFDFNZ0HzXRbxFgJdQNJ-Gs27uTba3H2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaLXiGUVjtVavD_deSLbJlBAtlkFckdxDcgPze=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

braised pork ramen - the pork was cold in the middle. the broth was extremely thin and salty. there were very few toppings included compared to a typical bowl of japanese ramen.

rainbow roll - pretty plain for cost

ambiance - not only was the family next to us LOUD  (which i don't fault the restaurant for), but the waitress and cook in the back were shouting to each other (which i do fault them for).< /Text>

Nothing fancy but food is good.  Specialty is Ramin noodle soup where you choose your broth and toppings.  Kid friendly too!< /review>

< Review>
Be ready to give high amount of tip or they will you attitude at you and ask for more. We were sitting on the table while I was signing on the receipt, and the server right a way stand by the table to check the tip and ask us about that. What kind of service is that? That’s not ok to check tip on the table when the customer not even leave yet. Even I was mad af, I still tip them more as he stood by me and was staring at how much I wrote on the receipt. F*cking terrible service and I definitely will never come back.<//Review>

<review>I want to like this place a bit more than I did. I struggled with of the service a little bit. They told me they had Boba, but only one flavor. the food was good but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is going for eaze and service. the menu seems a little bit limited.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>No idea why this place was so highly rated; the sauces were massively underseasoned, the noodles were overcooked, and the fixins were mediocre at best. It's definitely in the bottom 20% of ramen places in the Bay Area.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Ramen with a la carte ingredients. You pick your noodle and soup based. Then order your sides - as much or little as you like. I ordered a katsudon. It came very hot - the way it should be. The sauce is perfect. My date ordered a ramen with miso soup with sides. I think it is ok.  The service is great. The are not in your face but appears once I look like I want something.  I will definitely come back to try other things.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Superb ramen. We start with a bowl of tonkatsu broth ramen, $ 5.50, and then we choose supplements like ground pork, $ 3.00, or wakame, $ 2.50. I recommend.

<Review>During our stay in Southern California (coming from Canada) my family and I visited this restaurant today, (based off a friend’s recommendation). Oh boy, was she ever right! It’s a very quiet and family oriented place with very good service and very very delicious food. We had chow fun, beef broccoli and walnut shrimp!
I recommend this amazing restaurant to all people travelling to Orange County and people living close by.</Review>< GmapID>

My wife and I and a friend went there for the first time. My wife and I had the Orange Chicken, it was super good, possibly the best I've had. The orange sauce was nicely reduced with a great smelland the chicken was nice pieces of breast, not thighs. We also ordered and shared the Egg Fu Young and BBQ' pork fried rice, not bad at all. Will for sure make a return visit as they have a loaded menu to try.<//text>

Everyone one here is very nice, very friendly and wants to make sure you are happy, and they remembered us from the last time we came in. The food is amazing and the portions are perfect. We will definitely be coming back.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Dragon 21 is easy to get locate.  my husband and I enjoy the shrimp fried rice and one serving is easily enough for two people. Personally I have had the wonton soup. Very good especially for when one is not feeling well.<//Review>< Pics>

We have had small issues in the past, but today took the cake. We ordered at 6:43 pm and they did not give the order to the cooks until 7:08. I understand they are busy and yes I ordered for delivery, but that should not mean we have to wait on the restaurant orders to be placed first. They simply stated, "That's just how it is." Too many other places to order from, this will be our last time.<//Review>

<review>First time trying this place. So glad I did! Everything was Great!!! Crispy Walnut Shrimp was divine, the Mongolian beef was soooooo tender, almost melts in your mouth. MMMMMMMMM🤤. The service was also exceptional. Russell, the owner, is very personable and the serving staff is also very attentive. Will definitely be back soon!!!<//review><Date>1540522540679<//Date>< Pictures>

<text>First time coming to his place and the food was amazing. I’m a college student at Cypress College and wanted to try something away from the campus for once. Dragon 21 provided excellent service, delicious food and the setting was very pleasant and relaxed. Just what I needed after a long morning in class. Their kung pao Chicken is a must try! Highly recommend this place to everyone. Especially college students. It provided a nice intimate setting away from the high energy on campus. 👍🔥</text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Super disappointed, I ordered through the website. Edward called and asked me to cancel my order so they wouldn't have to pay 3rd party website. I pick up my order (website price $18) they wanted to charge me $26. I told them I would rather cancel than pay that much. The owner went on and on about we have the best food, fresh ingredients... Reluctantly, the owner gave me a discount, $19.99. I get my food home and it looks pretty good (looks can be deceiving). To make a long story longer, both the sweet and sour chicken and kung pao vegetables tatested old and the chicken was old and dry. I am concerned that I may not feel well tomorrow. Wish me luck. I definitely would not eat hear again.<//text>< pictures>

<review>It's my second time at this place I like the food but Linda the cashier has been rude both times I've been there. I complained to the manager/owner today about her and she even raised her voice at me In front of him and she continued being rude after he told her to calm down, I will never return here again, thanks to her attitude and bad customer service. Smile Linda, smile is the key and love your job!<//review>< Pictures>

<Name>Francis George<//Name><Review>The food here is terrible and way overpriced , got 2 beef dishes that tastes like rubber and chow mein straight up tastes like oil. They promote authentic chinese but it feels more like cheap fast chinese food, definitely not worth the price that they are charging. I looked through their reviews and most of them are for sure fake. Thanks for reading. Save your money as this place is definitely a hard pass.< /Review>< rate>

Chinese  restaurant  not even owned by chinese people. Food is bland and not authentic. Weird middle eastern owners keeps trying to pressure you to give a yelp review. So here. Dont go here. Restaurant  always empty.</Review>

Cheap food with msg like seasoning. Takes 5 mins to cook and the new owners are annoying and wont stop trying to concersate with you. Old owner eas better and the food is way overpriced. The almond cookies they sell for $6 is found at the 99 cent store.<//Review>

I found a bug in my chicken chow mein and pointed it out to the server. She tried to convince me it was part of the bean sprout. I magnified it with my husband's glasses to show her it was a bug! I had to tell her to make a new one for us, and she reluctantly replied "ok, we'll make a new one for u". I hate doing that because you never know what they actually do with it. Anyway, the water also tasted like dish washing liquid. Yuck, I'll never come back here. Btw, I'm Asian and i eat bean sprouts all the time. I know the difference.</Review>

Ordered online for delivery.  They paid no attention to the special instructions that stated that I needed plastic ware.  When I said they did not apologize but just said ok ok ok...  The place has really poor service.< /Review>

I tried this restaurant tonight and was not impressed, 6ish and there was NOBODY in the restaurant which was surprising considering how packed the parking lot was. Guessing everyone was at Sweetie Thai. We decided to try it anyway based on all the Yelpers recommending the Twinkie Walnut Shrimp, which is what we got. Not really impressed, the shrimp were not de-veined and it was such a pleasant sight the first view of the entrée, then they coated in mayonnaise.

Basically it was a mediocre version of Honey Shrimp.

The 2 of us shared the dish and with rice tax and tip it came to $24... for 1 entrée??? I don't think so. I will not be going back.<//Text>

It is understood that they are American-style Chinese food, but the beef they make, and the fried noodles can taste the Chinese. The level of the chef is very good. My special lunch with my husband today is less than 10 dollars. Give them a compliment.

她们有特价午餐,份量很足。据了解他们是偏美式的中餐,但是他们做的牛肉,还有炒面能吃出中国人的味道。厨师的水平很不错。我跟老公今天点的她们的特价午餐,都是10美金以内一份。给她们点赞。< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>A great shop for pet food, treats, and accessories! Whenever we walk by my dog always pulls in that direction because he knows how great it is. They always give him treats when we go. Their food and treats are higher end and on the pricier side, but good quality. They have a fridge/freezer section that has lots of fresh and raw options. There are occasional sales on certain brands. The staff is very knowledgeable and helped us to find a food that our dog loves! There are also grooming services available on location.</Review></record>

Very helpful staff and great products. Especially useful if you want to feed your pet raw food (they stock frozen food). A bit expensive but justified by their store and products.< /text>

<review>Love Healthy Spot. It's hard to know what food are healthier for dogs nowadays with so many options and reviews. This place gives you their recommended selection to choose from without being overwhelming.
It is pricier than Petco but I prefer it. The grooming is great. They took care of my dog Raven so well and always made him look adorable and since he was a senior dog, needed a lot of attention and patience.
Guillermo at Healthy Spot, knew my dog so well and it's great to have someone who's seen your dog age. He recommended foods and joint medications, especially since my dog's appetite kept changing and he had no teeth. Guillermo always asked if he could give my dog treats and my dog had fun roaming the store to get them.
I appreciate Healthy Spot in the neighborhood and when I get another dog, will be taking them right over.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1618605576656, 'text': "Hi, Marilyn. Thank you for your thoughtful review. We are so happy to hear that you love our store, our salon, and our staff. We're even happier to know we had been such a significant part of Raven's life. Thank you for trusting in us and allowing us to get to know him. We're looking forward to seeing you in the future, once you have a new pup for us to meet!"}</Resp>< Pictures>

The staff was amazing during our charity photo shoot! I had my hands full with our dogs so the staff were kind enough to grab the items I wanted for me and help me with my girls by providing them plenty of treats! We can not wait for our next visit. Woof 🐾<//Review>

This pet store is amazing! My little dog is the pickiest eater ever and everytime I am picking up her expensive soft food they give me samples of more affordable options for her to try, without me asking for it! Every single employee there shows this same helpfulness and kindness. The employees seem very knowledgeable about the nutritional benefits of each item as well as what is best for each dog. I've learned so many things just from talking to the employees. I also took my dog here for her 1st grooming appointment and they took great care of her. Great store and even better employees!!< /Review>

<Time>1614819769715< /Time><text>I learned about Healthy Spot just about a year ago. Rosco and I had our everyday bubble walk, which we never deviated from. That ended when the pandemic happened, and all the places we had been stopping before closed. As we started to create our new walking path, we happened upon Healthy Spot. Rosco was an immediate fan of the store and dragged me inside. There we had the tremendous opportunity to meet one of the rock star employees that are still there today, Guillermo.

Guillermo is not your typical retail employee. He goes way above and beyond that. He befriends you, fills you up with essential knowledge, and treats you like you’re one of the pack. Rosco took to Memo immediately. As if they had been best friends for years. I’ve never appreciated so much of a relationship between my dog and Memo. This bond extends to Veronica, who is now at Healthy Spot at Rockridge. Both of these wonderful people have brought light, hope, and immense joy to Rosco and me, and for that, I am eternally grateful. We miss Veronica deeply and hope she continues to be super successful at Rockridge.

Back to the Mission Bay store. The people here are amazing, and Stephanie is a welcome change that has been immensely hands-on and a part of the day-to-day business at the store. A stark difference from the past store Manager. Before Stephanie came on, I was under the impression Guillermo was the store leader because, to me, he is the face of the company. Day in and day out, Memo was there, always. I am equally happy Stephanie is here, and I hope her being here allows Memo the opportunity to further grow as a leader and run a store of his own.

Everyone here rocks. And Rosco and I genuinely enjoy coming in daily. It’s one of our favorite stops in the morning. So, make sure to come in and say hi to them! They are always friendly, smiling, and willing to help in EVERY way possible.

Thank you, Mission Bay team, for your excellence!< /text>< rate>

I’m seriously so grateful for the team and services at healthy spot! They care so much about our pup Carl. Grooming, daycare, and all the clean dog products... it’s just the best. The staff are really the best. We would be lost without them! They’ve helped us in so many pinches. And our Frenchie loves to be there. PS. It’s also nice to go to the food park next door!< /text>

First time getting my pup groomed in the city and it was at Healthy Spot! It seems like a fairly new location that aims to be integrated into the community (they had a free pet photoshoot during the holidays and have other events going on all the time)

I was super happy about the groom - my dog was super cute but more importantly, she seemed pretty happy about the time she spent there (~3 hours).

Typically $80 for dogs <10 lbs but first time customers can get 50% off if you download the coupon online!</text>

Love this little pet store! Always quiet, with great quality and variety of products. A bit more expensive than other places, but the quality is significantly better. The staff are friendly too, and always happy to see my dog and give her some treats and attention.
Their brand of treats are always well received by my picky dog, and my kids love the window into the doggy daycare next door.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I highly recommend Healthy Spot to all the dog lovers in San Francisco. I’ve went there for daycare, grooming, and purchasing dog supplies. They have high quality food, treats and toys, and the staff is very knowledgable about dogs and happy to answer any questions you may have.

For their daycare, there is always someone in the room with them, and they are very good at handling the dogs.

My dog went to get his nails done here once, and the groomer handled him expertly. He is a very sweet dog most of the time, but is a little difficult for his nails. He growled a little, but the groomer handled it calmly and did a fantastic job.

They carry high quality dog brands like Puppia, Stella and Chewys, Small Batch Pets, and more. They are now my default pet store, and I would recommend them to any pet owner in the city.<//text><time>1557683276209<//time><Response>{'time': 1565395681435, 'text': "Hi Erica!\n\nThank you for the kindhearted review!

<Text>Jeff Lecoeuche and his staff have always been helpful and given me good advice on my personal insurance.  I also appreciate that they don't pressure me to buy anything.

< review>
Jeff has been our insurance agent for many years. We really needed him when our home burned, along with our entire neighborhood in the 2017 Tubbs Fire. Jeff and the Farmers team were great- professional, courteous, and responsive. Our neighborhood formed a social media group which was very helpful in getting our homes rebuilt. We felt very fortunate to have Farmers insurance when our neighbors shared their experiences with other insurance companies. That's the real test of an insurance company.</review>

I've been with farmers insurance since i began driving at age 16. That's 36years of quality service and they've always been there for  me when I needed them. I have needed them on more then 1 occasion and the folks at help point always sunny and bubbly and let me tell you, that counts when your scared worried and alone they turn a horrific situation into a blessing i kid you not.

Thanks Farmers!

I've had many insurance policies over the years: business, car, home, rental, liability, life, health and so on. In all the years of dealing with insurance companies and agents I have never encountered such personal involvement in the decision process of what type of policy and coverage would be best for me for the the insurance agency.  Professionalism, knowledge, availability, patience, responsibility, follow through, consideration, and education are but a few words to describe the Jeff Lecoeuche insurance agency. Many companies are available to you as  you become a new client, but Jeff and his agency are completely available past the stage of getting you as a client. I feel taken care of and supported and most of all safe in knowing I  have the exact policies I need in place.  Thank you Jeff for making this an enjoyable experience.</Text>

<Text>Jeff and his staff are friendly, knowledgeable and thorough. Jeff was careful to make surely that I was aware of any needs I may not have been aware of, and he helped me find coverage that I can afford that protects me well.

In my sperience, Jeff cares deeply about his clients, and I've known him to go far out of his way to help when a client had a major problem. I recommend him and his business wholeheartedly.<//Text>< time>

Jeff has been very helpful in getting and maintaining liability insurance for my business. He helped me get a lower rate than the big yoga insurance companies, which were out of my price range. He is available to answer questions that come up throughout the year as well.< /review>

< review>
I have had my share of insurance company issues. Until I got Farmers Insurance seven years ago.
Originally I went with Farmers to help out a fellow War Veteran. Then I was very impressed with Farmers thoughness , I've been with them every since. Long after my Veteran friend Daniel moved on.
Great job Jef<//review>

<Review>Had an issue with my car overheating on my way home from work one morning. I called the owner and he said he'd take a look. I was worried it wouldn't drive again, but with the help of this mechanic I am able to drive my car again. They showed me what exactly was wrong, and showed me the busted parts on my car that caused it. Very honest and would highly recommend to anyone else that needs quick repairs.<//Review>< Pics>

Wonderful because they try very hard to help and they have the expertise.

They gave me their honest opinion with an estimate and when I compared it with others, I decided this was the mechanic shop for me.<//review>

Owner is very accommodating going so far as to share lunch with us. Service with a smile and a slice! He honored a Vet fallen on hard times and did it with class and dignity.< /review>

I came in for an oil change/ possibly leak and Kamal and Vince were very friendly and helpful. They inspected my car diagnosed the issue and explained everything in detail. They did not have the oil type my car needed and Kamal the owner went out and beyond to have it delivered here and gave me a real good price. I strongly recommend Magic Lube & Auto Repair. My husband and I always come here to get our oil change.<//Text>

<Review>New to town and totally helpless when it comes to cars, but Kamal and his team were so kind and understanding to me, didn’t have to wait at all and everything was laid out and explained very transparently. Oil change was done in 5 minutes, and they even helped patch up some other rough areas free of charge. Such a great experience, coming out of a garage with my “second dad in San Diego”! These people will look after you!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Let's just say that 5 stars isn't enough! I have never been to a mechanic where I felt so at peace knowing they're taking great care of my car and that they will be totally honest about what it needs, every step of the way. What knowledgeable, practical, and kind service! The owner clearly takes pride in being a businessman with integrity and it is a rare and wonderful thing!</Review>

Best Auto Repair Shop I've found in SD yet!! The employees and manager are super nice and fair when it comes to pricing and the customer's needs. What I thought was a transmission issue turned out to be a faulty sensor. Thanks you guys for repairing the gas sensor in such a timely and efficient way :)  I will definitely visit in the future!</text>

I've had one of the best experiences working with these gentlemen. They are very honest and helpful with any questions or concerns you may have, even if you don't plan to get things done right away. When I finally did return to have my car fixed there, it was fixed in a matter of a couple hours and fixed correctly. I always go directly to them for any questions or concerns. I can't even explain how much money they have saved me just by being honest and getting the job done quickly and efficiently...< /text>

<Review>These guys were honest and straightforward. They replaced my clutch for a reasonable price and it functions perfectly. I was able to have my old parts back to inspect and see why it needed replaced. They went out of their way to find a lug nut key (since I forgot to leave mine in the car), so I wouldn't have to make another trip to the shop. Also, they went ahead and topped off my manual transmission fluid for free. Thanks, and I will return with future car repair needs.</Review><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>Not only are they genuinely concerned with the health of your vehicle, but they also take the time to educate you on how to take care of it yourself, as well as on some of the subtleties that make your model different or special. They also tell you the things your dealership doesn't want you to know, which is a plus. Great hospitality too.< /text>< gmap_id>

I was having trouble with my car and a friend suggested I go to this place. He said they did a great job taking care of his Ford when he had a problem. I went ahead and gave them a try, and was very happy that I did!! They are very friendly, very professional, and very HONEST, hard to find these days. They don't charge an arm and a leg either. I feel very comfortable coming here in the future, having established a relationship with these guys. Thanks again, car is running fantastic!</review>

Honda completely messed up my air filters. They wanted to charge 90 plus dollars to change it, which also causes me to run out of gas fast. I came to magic lube and and the owner kamal was so helpful and prices are very reasonable. He told me the truth about how Honda takes money from innocent people, they honestly do. I am coming to magic lube from here on out thank you so much to kamal and the team ❤️</text>

I didn't have any work done on my car but the guy was great. I needed him to look at my suspension  because my car started pulling real hard to the right all of the sudden. He had me pull up and inspected it and said everything was fine and all I needed was an alignment. (He referred me to another shop because he doesn't have the equipment to do alignments.) I would go back to him because he seemed like a person that was very honest and ran a good shop. Everything was clean and everyone was very nice. I would go back if I needed something done for sure.</text>

This place was a godsend. Oil light came on and I knew I wasn't due for an oil change.  They were busy and I was prepared to wait.  Jamal , owner, came out and he said he would take care of me.  Less than a cup of oil and very black even though just had my oil changed 5 weeks ago.  He checked for leaks and found none. Precision, in El Cajon, has always done my oil and filter. They changed the filter but not my oil.  I was told had I driven much longer my engine would have siezed. Jamal showed me the oil he drained and explained all he did. If you want excellent service a fair price and people who really care, go to Magic Lube at 1759 Euclid Ave and talk with Jamal!

Just moved from LA to SD and found magic lube & auto repair one day when my car was due for an oil change. Kamal and his team are so kind and honest. They don’t try to rip you off or up sell you on anything you don’t need. I love that, especially being a female who doesn’t know too much about car stuff. Thank you Kamal! I will keep returning here for my car services!</Review>

Fantastic place to go and get your car worked on.  They were able to fix my 93 Corolla's radiator and fixed the position my alternator (I had placed it wrong and that caused my water pump to blow up my radiator).  I took my 04 Mustang and the owner taught me basic car maintenance which I really appreciated. I'm defiantly coming back to get my transmission and engine leak fix.<//Text>

I will definitely be returning for any car problems that me come up in the future. I will highly recommend them to everyone I know.</review><Gmap_id>0x80d953fc9b533673:0x842150c24b5cd80f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I just had my oil changed at Magic Lube and had a great experience.  The owner, Kamal, was on site, knowledgeable and friendly.  I could see that they changed the filter and they filled the oil all the way up.  There was no up-sell or pressure.  They did a good job for a good price and Kamal is a great guy.<//Text>

<text>Exactly what you hope for when working with a mechanic shop. I have used this place three times now. Amazing transmission work, smog check repair, and brake work at a fair price. I strongly recommend this place and intend to go back if I ever need another repair.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

They are a little more expensive, but worth it as their warranty is awesome. If anything happens within 2 years, they'll replace it. Interstate batteries also has amazing customer support as well, which is why we are proud to install their new car batteries for all the automobiles we service that vehicle problems like yours.  It's a shame that you did not have the receipt of the auto mechanic that sold you the used car battery. Having the receipt with the warranty on it with the date might have helped you in calling out the auto repair facility."}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

First time coming here today and was surprisingly very pleased with the service ! I called to get a quote and the owner answered and told me it would be $40 for my 2001 Honda Accord LX. Already less than the place I would go to by Point Loma Midway. I could tell my car needed the oil change already, it even felt rough so I needed to do it today and he said bring it in! The mechanic and the receptionist guy couldn't get their names but are very nice and greeted us right away and got started. I told them I had all the necessary stuff I bought at auto zone already since my dad was going to change it for me but hadn't had the time and so they only charged for the labor! About $25! I will be coming here all the time now as it's much closer to my house! It's right across the Arco. Really recommend this place!<//Text>

I called after 3:45 for a smog certification, and expected to be told to try tomorrow.  Vince told me to come on in and that it only would take 15 mins.  I arrived at 4:15 and sure enough I was out of there in about 15 mins.  Vince was very personable and the other guy was too.  It was totally painless, I didn't even feel like I was waiting on my car.  The service was fast, accurate and efficient.  I will definately return and highly recommend their place to others!<//Review>

< review>
Took my Audi to check out the engine light warning. Since I was there, I decided to do my 55K maintenance as well.  Kamal (the owner) said he would charge me $45 for the minor maintenance and $120 for the diagnostic.  Unfortunately, they were unable to find the cause of the problem because the Audi is a newer car. Kamal didn't charge me for both the $120. He didn't even charge me for the maintenance service even though I would be happy to pay it.  Needless to say, I was happy with the experience. Kamal and his crew were highly honest and professional. I would definitely recommend my family and friends to this shop.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>About 6 years ago my 4runner transmission would just stop tranmissioning at the worst times.  Very intermittent.  So my buddy and I removed the tranny which included the transfer case.  I found Magic lube and brought the tranny down for Vince to repair.  We installed it and had  little issue that Vince fixed.

Flash Forward to 11-2015 (about 90K miles later), the old 4runner crapped out, but you know what, the transmission was working perfectly, no issues for 6 years (no preventative service at either).

So Vince does good work that lasts.<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Flat tire was repaired with an "Inside the Tire" patch which is the best way to fix the tire (as opposed to an "Outside the Tire" plug method).  Josh scheduled the work promptly with Julio doing the repair.  Julio also topped off the air in the other 3 tires.  I was out of there in less than 30 minutes.  Very professional and everyone wearing masks.  Cost was $29.99.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Amazing service and honest staff. Came here to get a tire fixed and I was expecting them to try selling me services I didn’t need. The honest repairman fixed my tire at no cost and gave me information about the status of my other tires. I will be coming back and they beat Costco prices should you need tire service.< /text>

Friendly people and good prices on tires, but I caution the quality of work here.

They installed new tires on my car but messed up a few things. The air suspension on my car had no prior problems until they put new tires on. Two air suspensions needed to be replaced. I had to go to a specialist and have them fix this for an additional $1100...

they also installed a tire pressure meter incorrectly and one tire leaked and would go flat everyday...took it to a specialist and they said the washer was installed incorrectly...<//Review>

Picked up a metal bolt in my front tire. Came by here, 5 minutes from my office, and they had me in and out in less than 20 minutes. The manager, Christian, and the service writer, Josh, were kind and helpful. They didn't automatically try to sell me a set of tires, but looked at what would be best in my situation. Enjoyed my time there and got a good value.<//review>

Needed some suspension work and they did a quick great job repairing.   A day later i returned with a question. Without hesitation, they popped it up on the rack and checked it out.   Turned out it was a tire out of balance( the tire was not from them)  Great customer service !<//Text>

Enrique took my car in, last minute on a Sunday, and saved me from buying a super expensive, run-flat tire. He spotted a nail that was causing my tire to deflate.  He patched within 15 minutes and had me out of there in a flash. Great, honest service!< /review>

<text>Ran over a nail.  Googled 'tire repair near me'. CT&S had great reviews. Got there when they opened at 7:30. Didn't have an appointment but they fixed the tire within 30 minutes. Trust worthy staff that seem to have integrity. I was pleasantly surprised. Will definitely get my car serviced here from now on. Good service always get my vote.  Thanks again CT&S.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Called ahead to see if they could fit me into their day and was told to come right on in. From the moment I pulled up I was greeted with great service, no wait, was guided to go into the front where I met Jimmy. I’m not very knowledgeable about cars so he talked to me to see what I think I needed, and then went out to check (on a surface level) for himself. I’m always skeptical of auto shops, ripping you off, charging extra and more than what’s needed but Jimmy was straight up and honest with me. Didn’t recommend the most expensive products as my only option. He talked me through the differences in prices, and quality and allowed me to make my own informed decision. The time it took to service my car was swift and efficient and everyone gives excellent customer care. By far my easiest and smoothest car service to date. The guys here, especially Jimmy made this pain free and quick as possible. I highly recommend coming here to get your car serviced. Ask for Jimmy and he’ll hook you up!</Review>< pictures>

My friend referred me to this shop 5 years ago and I have been extremely happy with the service here. They’re reliable, honest, and very quick with everything I’ve needed. Even though I no longer live on the West Side, they’re still my mechanics of choice. I HIGHLY recommend California Tire & Service!< /review>

I walked back to my car during lunch and saw that my tire was flat... called AAA they inflated my tire and then told me that its better to get the tire repaired instead if using the spare I had... so I googled a place near work and saw that this place had great reviews... they fixed my tire...and changed my oil quickly! Very professional and speedy service!<//text>

<Response>None</Response><review>This place is great. Just found a nail in my tire today and brought it in at 4:30pm on a Tuesday. Jimmy was great, got me in and had it repaired quickly on the spot. They also do more than tires, I trust these guys (family business) and will be back for services like fluid changes and alignment too.

I have a Toyota and my dealership still covers oil changes but always tries to sell me overpriced services. They had told me I needed to replace this tire with the nail (which I knew wasn’t true, only 30K miles on these tires and the nail was in the center of the tread not the edge).

Save your money and don’t trust dealerships and big chains. This spot is family owned and run honestly. Great work, will be back!<//review><UserId.>111516259664033342208<//UserId.>< Rating>

The guys at California tire are super friendly and NEVER tried to up sell me. They told me about an issue with my brakes that needs to be fixed. I couldn’t do it that day, so they said they’d honor the quote they gave me and told me to come back when I was ready. Love the no pressure vibe and fast service!< /Text>

I had a flat tire inundated with a huge nail, did a phone inquiry and guy was quick to answer.  They accommodated me for a walk-in, no appt needed.  Less than 30 minutes and problem solved! Wheew that was fast! Would come here again next time and definitely recommend this service shop to everyone. Quality work, prompt
Telephone inquiry, friendly staff, reasonable fee, quick service 5/5!</Text>

<review>I'm not an avid reviewer by any means, but I like to give credit where credit is due and let me just say, Jimmy and Chris deserve all the credit. These guys were not only super accommodating, but Jimmy went out of his way to walk with us to my friend's car where she had gotten a flat tire (a few blocks). He helped us with a travel compressor she had with her, that allowed us to get the car over to their shop so they can further work on it. Chris and Jimmy were extremely helpful, honest and forthcoming. Though, this was not my car they were tending to, I wouldn't hesitate, not even for a second to pay them a visit for any needs of my own. Thank you both, again!  1,000% recommend California Tire & Service.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None</pics>< Name>

I went to pep boys to get an estimate for a tire on my 2018 Audi A5, and said I had no choice but to change my tire since it was going flat.  I figured it just needed a patch. My tire was almost $200 , I called California Tires and they offered a fair price if I had to change my tire, but most importantly they took the time to actually show me my tire was no good anymore. They have great customer service and are very understanding , specially for a female to have a car issue , I must admit I freak out and feel useless. They got it taken care of and made me feel like I wasn’t alone and they actually cared about helping me!!!! Thank you Chris for all your help!!!<//text>

<name>Xiaokun Xu</name><Review>I went into the shop with a broken tire which is fairly new. Instead of sell me up on a new one, the owner actually tell me to check if the shop that I bought the tire (a full set of 4) from would honor some gaurantee. I eventually ended up going to another shop to fix it for a cheaper price, but I am impressed by the hornesty of this shop's owner.</Review>< Time>

<text>It’s hard to trust a car repair place especially when you’re a little lady, but this place is legit. This is a family run shop and the guys here are HONEST. They are not trying to screw you over.
I had gone into my dealer to get recall parts replaced and then they told me that I needed more work done for $$$. I came here and they said nothing was wrong and I just needed my system reset. And the repair guy Ernesto is also so nice! Thank you Chris and Mark!</text>< name>

Purchased a Groupon for an oil change that I needed!!!  The team was nice, professional and didn't try to gouge me or up sale me anything extra (other than the extra quart of oil not covered by the Groupon).  I was satisfied.  Jimmy was great!  I recommend this place highly for your car needs.<//text>

I purchased a tire several months ago and they were terrific in handling my situation. I went there last week to see if they would balance and rotate my tires and they did this at no cost to me. I was flabbergasted that they did this and this is part of their customer service because I had purchased a tire in the past. I would take my car there for work in a heartbeat! Thanks so much.<//Text>

Excellent Service & Honest - Came in here with a leak in one of my tires. My car is less than a year old, and they were able to find the leak and fix it. I was on a break from work, and they squeezed me in and got me on my way before my next meeting! These guys are awesome.<//Text>

This is a small shop, but packed with an awesome crew. Pricing is always fair and they deliver on time as promised.
It's funny I'm the guy that always checks around for pricing, and end up here. Still get the best service.</review>

They are pretty good and they are always friendly. The price is very good, I have my own oil and filter I just need someone or just a place to change it. Other places ask for 20 or more, and a m********er asked for $46 which is really silly. They charged me only 15 plus cleaned my engine bay!

Thumb up!< /review>

I had brought my car in to get the battery replaced and I was taken care of immediately.  When the battery was unable to be replaced due to the after market alarm installed, Vic took an extra 20 minutes to solve the problem. The service was quick and friendly. These guys are awesome and know what they are doing!</review>

i like them but the only problem i have is that i had my rack and pinion replaced and now they cant get the car started and even the manager cant understand what happened. cause it was working fine until the rack got installed.  they are really good people though and he didnt try to cover it up and is going to do everything he can to get it running</Text>

These guys are great. I've bought many tires from these guys and they have  always adjusted the air pressure of my tires for free. They will go out of their ways to make the most economical deal for their customers.< /Review>

I came in for an oil change and live down the street. I left the car there all day for them to give it a look. I mentioned the deal they had here on yelp and they gave it to me even though I didn't buy it through yelp.

They found my rear brakes/parking brake was falling apart. From experience, i can tell you that it certainly wasn't working to it's fullest potential. They also wanted me to replace my tires, but I wasn't really sold on that idea... They quoted me a fair price over the phone for the brake adjustment and cleaning.

I came back just as they were closing shop and they gave me an even better deal on the oil and the brakes and I hadn't even asked for it!

Very clean and friendly and I will certainly be returning for anything else car related.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Great place. Best thing that ever happened to me and my Ford Windstar was to have it towed to California Tire. They did a fantastic job, quick and great price, and we're still on the road.

Will go back!<//Text>

Like most working peeps, I put my car maintenance off as long as I can because I simply don't have time to do it on the weekdays! For the sake of my dying car, THANK GOD this place was open on Saturday... be warned that the wait to do even a quick oil change even with an appointment is at least 3 hours on weekends.

Unless you are eating at bossa nova or Island's nearby, ask a friend to pick you up.  $17 oil change. Cheapest in the west side so far :)</text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
These people are lazy. Called Raul  3 times and they said they would get back to me (Raul is the owner) Transferred me to Ralph (the body work shop guy) but he hung up on me. Wouldn't recommend these guys at all. Very unprofessional. Besides the fact that they couldn't fix a simple fender bender, wouldn't recommend them at all.< /Review>

Best breakfast I’ve ever had. Everything was made fresh and was perfection. I highly recommend this for a wonderfully different take on breakfast.</review>

The food is amazing! I went last Sunday and found myself back today. I ordered the Salmon poco both times. The serings are gigantic and the food is on point. They are have fresh squeezed juice. I tried the apple and it was divine!!< /text>

We were here today for brunch. Even though we used Yelp to get in line ahead of time, and had a baby with us, we still waited 45 minutes in line! After we finally set down the waitress that came to us wasn't sure if someone already took our order or not... The whole place felt disorganized. The food itself was good enough, large portions, the bacon wasn't overcooked and the pancake was good. However, we will not be returning after the long wait.< /Text>

I have a few things to share about the place and the service, less about the food. The most important one - THE TIP IS INCLUDED IN THE BILL!

The good
* The freshly squeezed juices are soooo good! Very refreshing, although not cheap (~$6-7 for a medium sized glass)
* The food is fresh and good - Chocolate chip pancakes were delicious!

The bad
* PSA! The tip is already included when you get the check! - They never mentioned that, and I found out about it a few hours too late. I know it's my fault as you should scan the bill and verify, but that usually happens when there is a big party - We were four people, and no one mentioned anything about it. Really annoying and makes you feel cheated.
* The place is tiny but we were ready for that and joined the queue from home via Yelp. When we came, we were the third party in line (total of four people). With all that, we've waited over 50 minutes to be seated. Not sure if we got unlucky, but this something you need to take into consideration
* Brunch - The potatoes were good, a bit too salty, the eggs were great, but no salt or pepper at all.  Kind of weird.

Due to the issue with the tip, while the place is nice, I feel like it is not entirely honest and I won't be coming back.<//text>

Food was okay. Wasn't blown away.

Four of us enjoyed brunch at the counter.  My chicken soup was so pretty that others took a picture of it.  Delicious too. Plenty of large chunks of chicken and vegetables.  The menu had a mix of healthy and indulgent food.  We were all happy with our meals.</Text>

When our regular breakfast place was to crowded we thought we'd give this place a try and we were not disappointed.  Food was great quality, served quickly and good portion size.  I especially liked the bacon which came with my eggs.  It was not too crispy, a tad on the pleasantly thick side and very meaty.  Give this place a try.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Ate the crazy Moco (pork katsu, rice, gravy, 2 eggs sunny side up), which is a very filling and delicious way to start your day. The atmosphere is a bit loud due to the small space, but the service is fairly fast and the large glass walls make the space feel larger. There are both tables and counter seats which filled up around noon today. When we arrived at 1130,  we did not wait for a table (4 top).

If you're looking for a good, solid breakfast beyond your standard eggs, bacon, and toast, I recommend coming here. If it's busy, be prepared to wait.</review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<review>Overpriced and very mediocre. Coffee was fine; food was nothing memorable. I ate here recently and cannot remember what I ate, and remember having to get more food afterwards because I was left hungry and paid too much money to leave hungry.</review></record></dataset><record>
<review>Love this brunch spot. Great options, great staff, cool place. If you're getting the omlete, it's worth adding cheese. The carrot orange ginger is my favorite juice anywhere.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
Wait: As there are very few brunch spots around the Inner Richmond, this place tends to have a 20-30 min wait. They do have the Yelp reservation system though, so you can reserve your spot in line ahead of time without having to actually wait outside.

Ambiance: The place is pretty small, but has a cozy feel. Even though it's usually busy, service is pretty fast and staff is friendly and attentive.

Food: I had the Crazy Moco with a side of bacon. The pork katsu was slightly dry, but the crust was super crispy. The gravy was very rich and had a nice little kick (though I could use a little more). The bacon was nice and thick, but still crispy. My companion had the crab Benedict. The eggs were poached well and the hollandaise was nice and creamy. The crab wasn't too sweet, but was still good.

Price: The portions are quite big here, but the price seemed a bit too high for what you are getting. The Benedict dish ended up being around $30.< /Review>

Coffee leaves a little bit to be desired, and sometimes the potatoes are a little hard, but we keep coming back time and time again for the crazy good french toast and omlettes.<//Review>

<review>It's all about the inferno bacon, lemon ricotta pancakes, and loco moco dishes. The rest of the menu is pretty "meh". Don't forget you can order a single side pancake for $6 or some bacon on the side as well. The super moco was pretty big -- enough for two to share with a couple of additional sides. We also ordered the B mix-up, which was okay, but I'd probably pass on it for next time as I couldn't really appreciate the crumbled bread and potato side. The BACON was the best part.

The ginger espresso shot was interesting -- mostly ginger and lemon, but no coffee flavor at all. Tasted like a great health / immunity booster.

The restaurant definitely looks like it took over an old Chinese restaurant with the neon lighting.< /review>< Pics>

On the down side, there are around 6 tables here, but staff runs around like they are trying to cover 20 tables. Chill guys, it's sunday🤙< /text>< gmapID>

The best car service I have ever experienced. I hire car services frequently for my boss, and this is by far the best. They are available in many US cities. If my boss is traveling to a city they service in, they are my first choice and always available. I frequently have to change the hourly schedule and pickup time/locations for my boss because of the nature of his job, and they are always quick to respond and accommodate. I recommend them highly!< /review>

I am in San Francisco often and have used other services to and from SFO.  I saw the reviews for Five Emerald and decided to try on my visit a month ago.  What a find!  Their service was outstanding!!!  They were on time (early each time actually) and the drivers were beyond courteous and helpful.  The communication was outstanding as well...always received texts when the driver was on site.  I am beyond grateful to have found this wonderful service!!!<//Review>

My wife was traveling with two large suitcases to DEN and I was on a business trip.  Needed someone to meet her at the airport, help her with the bags, and drop her off at her final destination.  Most don't offer "meet and greet" service claiming the airport doesn't allow it due to "security concerns."  Five Emerald provides it and did it well.  Coordinated with my wife via cell phone on her arrival, met her, helped with the luggage, and did it all professionally and courteously.  Would use them again in a heartbeat.<//review>

<review>Great Service
We had great experience with Five Emerald, who arranged a trip for our big group. We booked 3 Mercedes Sprinters in Bay Area to do sightseeing for 2 days. The booking was easy, always replying to our questions promptly. The drivers were on time and we were thrilled with their service. They gave us great suggestions what to see, that we didn’t have on our list. Highly recommended especially to a big group looking for a transportation with the professionals.<//review>< Response>

He was incredibly friendly and offered tons of suggestions for places to visit and eat in San Francisco. The car was immaculately clean. The (free) car seat he had for our son was also spotless. He offers so much more than just a ride to your destination. When we visit San Fran again we will definitely be using Five Emerald Limo. A+!<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I used this service on a recent trip to San Jose, flying into and out of San Francisco airport. Both drivers I had were fantastic; very professional, accommodating, thoughtful and punctual.
I appreciated that for my very early morning pick up Ron was considerate of it being so early and not trying to make lots of small talk (not that I mean to sound rude, but as I am not a morning person, not having to chat continually was nice.). Also during the drive for my pick up from the airport on the way to San Jose, the driver (I am so sorry I can't remember his name.) had lots of interesting tidbits about California and the area I was staying that were a nice set up for my vacation.
Lastly, I was very impressed with the communication through their website! My questions were answered right away and setting up my pickups was a breeze.

I was nervous about using a service I knew nothing about, but after reading all the good reviews and now my own experience I would use Emerald Limousine again in a heart beat.  Their rates were good, the drivers very punctual and capable, cars were extremely clean and the service outstanding. I felt safe and confident in their capable hands.

Thank you so much for helping to making my trip to California easy and memorable!</Review>

<text>We needed a ride from Berkeley to SFO for my wife and son to catch a relatively early flight. We booked with Five Emerald, as they had really good reviews. They were there a few minutes early, with a spacious clean modern vehicle. The driver was very courteous and helpful. The staff operating the phones with whom I spoke during the booking were super friendly and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this firm.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Five Emerald was flawless, and they accommodated my every last-minute change to my first order. I've been a loyal customer ever since. They are the best and most reasonable service I've used, and I would never use anyone else.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
In California just this past weekend 04_12_19, we used the service to go from SFO airport to Santa Rosa, CA round trip over a weekend.  The Drivers were on time and we were delivered on time but that's the extent of the positive feedback.  Besides being very expensive (I know it's California) but the Vehicles were in serious disrepair!  It appears that 5 Emeralds is a driver brokerage service as one of the drivers was monitoring Multiple Services throughout our trip.  The First Car was a Lincoln Aviator and it was torn up on the inside and had a Huge Crack all the way across the windshield, Seats and consoles were torn and just really beat up.  The car shook significantly each time he applied the brakes, the Driver was eating Chips our of the passenger seat the entire 1.5 hr trip (really) we were just thankful to get where we were going SAFELY.  We considered multiple times about cancelling our return trip and finding another service but we thought that was a "fluke" surely the next one would be better on the return.  We were pleasantly surprised when we got picked up for the return trip it was a very clean and nice Lincoln Navigator and it was clean and neat on the inside, BUT...  about 30 minutes into our trip back the Transmission started slipping and shaking!  Really? There were several hills where the driver had to let way off the gas just to get the transmission to catch and Cars were flying Up the hill past us as we putted up at 28 mph hoping to get to the top.  I started my UBER app just to see who was in the area.  Again very stressful.  We finally made it back to the airport but I'm Glad we padded our time by 2 additional hours so we weren't late...  I Don't recommend 5 Emeralds.<//Review>

<Review>I used them several times on my recent trip to San Francisco and the service was nothing short of spectacular. The vehicles were clean and beautiful and the drivers were very experienced, friendly and professional. The reservation and confirmation processes were prompt and very helpful. The drivers were always early and ready to open their doors with a smile. I would use them again without hesitation for all transportation needs and I would (and will) recommend them to anyone!<//Review>< UserId.>

Four of us were visiting San Francisco and attending a concert at Levi's stadium in Santa Clara. Five Emerald made getting there and getting back a wonderful experience! The drivers were awesome, the cars were beautiful and comfortable, and the price was excellent! I highly recommend Five Emerald Limousine!< /Review>

The best company
I had guest coming to town , we decided to show them SF at night. I made a little investigation were to book . When i called Five Emerald they understood me well what i was looking for and suggested us to take stretch Limousine for San Francisco tour. I am so satisfied with their service, out friends got really impressed with the tour and they absolutely enjoyed the ride . Herman our driver was very knowledgeable.
He took us to the places where we could see the best of town .
I recommend to use their service, it is really nice to find a reliable and professional company. They are the best<//review>

I decided to try out a different limo service for my client's prom and was very happy with my decision.  Five Emerald Limousine Limo representatives were quick with their responses, very helpful and their driver Carl was awesome!  The limo was clean and Carl was very professional.  Will definitely recommend their service to future clients.< /Review>

<Text>I decided to book us for Five Emerald -- for airport pickup and dropoff (private car), and for the hourly service over two days (luxury SUV). For the airport pickup -- our flight arrived an hour early, so we were ready to be picked up 45 minutes before our scheduled pickup. When we called to see if the car could accommodate us early, the dispatcher said the car would be there for us in "five minutes or less." Sure enough -- there he was, in less than five minutes. I thought it was awesome how quickly they could accommodate our last-minute change. And the car seat for my daughter was there, secured and needing no adjustments. That was yesterday. Today was our first day of hourly service, and the driver, Luis, was wonderful. He arrived on time (despite unanticipated construction), and with the car seat exactly as it was for the airport pickup. He took us everywhere we wanted to go, tried to find us other places we were looking for while he waited for us, and was diligent and courteous. We wanted to be dropped off half an hour earlier than what we scheduled, and the company is issuing us a prorated refund (for the unused portion of the booking). Everyone we've interacted with at Five Emerald has been professional, accessible, and accommodating. From the first contact (online, trying to price the services) through to last minute changes -- they represent every reason we decided to book a car service, as opposed to a car rental or winging it with taxis/Uber. AMAZING!<//Text></record>

After an initial disappointment with this service, the owner contacted me himself to apologize. I was impressed that he took the time to get back to us, and so we tried the service again. We have now used them three times and are happy with the service, punctuality, friendliness of the drivers and quality of the vehicles.<//Text>

Best limo car service in the four years I have been in the US.
Drivers rush round to open the door, are polite, helpful and the cars are immaculate.
I had Gana as my first driver, I didn't get the name of the second guy but he was also fantastic.
Superb, can't recommend them highly enough and I can be a picky customer...
Great drivers as well, obviously!</Text>

If I could do 10 stars I would. Five Emerald saved the day. I can't say enough great things about Tina and her team's professionalism of Five Emerald Limo. They were always early and stayed on top of the needs of over a dozen major recording artists and their teams. Five Emerald Limo provided over 60 trips for me in a three day period and I didn't have one complaint... but I did receive several praises. I will always use Five Emerald Limo in the Bay Area they're second to none.<//review>

I went on line and signed up for a sedan to take me from Sonoma to SFO airport, [an hour and 35 minute ride] to be picked up by 7:45 pm.  My driver showed up in a beautiful Cadillac SUV at 7:40 pm prompt, grabbed my bag, took all the right roads and arrived at the airport in exactly 1 hour and 30 minutes. (as our previous driver 'from another company' took us 45 minutes out of our way)   I would highly recommend 5-Emerald.< /review>

We are presently at the start of our wine tasting and I have to say that so far, I’m exceptionally disappointed. The quality of the vehicles is really poor. Outdated and not clean. The drivers have been on time, but not particularly friendly. The driver who took us from San Francisco to Napa yesterday was clearly annoyed that we asked him to take the slightly longer route over the Golden Gate Bridge and he drove like a maniac. There was a large amount of slamming on the brakes and sliding around in our seat. The driver we have for our wine tasting is the same driver who picked us up at the airport. He barely speaks, the car smells and is both dated and dirty inside. We actually discussed canceling the service after our airport pick up but decided it must be a fluke. My heart sank when I saw the same driver and car waiting for us outside of our hotel this morning. For $1500, we were expecting a lot more from this service. I would not recommend.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808580bb9d11a0f5:0xfb07c73c11ebadd8<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Me and my husband hired Five Emerald Limousine car service for wine tour in Napa, we did not have everything planned in advance, so we asked the driver, Nika for advice! And that was a good decision:) super friendly and professional driver made our tour a success! There was no problem when we decided to stay longer, than expected! The whole experience with the company was a pleasure! Thank you Nika and all the company staff! Hope we’ll get back to you soon!<//text><date>1544729932212</date>< rating>

Last two trips weren't great experiences.

On the most recent trip, I explained in the booking request that our kids are 2 & 4, and our reservation confirmation correctly stated "two forward facing toddler seats". But the vehicle arrived with 2 unharnessed booster seats only, labelled 3-10 years. Instead of apologizing, the driver argued with us at the airport curbside that these seats were fine.

On the trip prior, the car seat type was correct, and the driver was OK, but the seats were extremely old and incorrectly installed, so I had to pull them out and reinstall before we could get going to airport.

Getting these details correct is what we pay (at significant expense) & expect from a professional limo service.

3 stars (rather than 2 or 1) because we've had previous trips with five emerald that ran smoothly.  However after 2 bad trips in a row we will be going elsewhere for our next trip.<//review>

<Text>I am so glad I booked this town car from SFO rather than a taxi service. The service called me as soon as I was in the airport (based on my arrival time given) and Michelle, our driver was there within 5 minutes! She was great, even though we had a bad time at the airport since my hubs lost his phone on the plane and was freaking out, understandably so! Michelle offered a comforting voice and suggestions on what to do since we were not thinking clearly, lol. Next time I visit San Fran I will be calling this service for sure! Thank you Michelle for your kindness and compassion AND getting us to the hotel safely!< /Text>< name>

<review>Excellent service and professional,  always on time and willing to accommodate changes to your reservations. I use them whenever I go from Sonoma to SFO. All of their drivers are great, but if it's your first time ask for Gabr. Couldn't recommend Five Emerald more.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Very courteous driver and the pickup was flawlessly timed. I would have rated a 5 star but I'm giving it a 4 star since I was not told upfront that they would automatically add 20% tip to prepaid payment. My preference is to tip at the end of the ride; based on the service level provided. I also prefer to tip cash.  The trip cost from SFO airport to downtown is $60 but they add a 10% fuel surcharge of $6.00

I checked with a few of their competitors and they quoted me $55.00 to the airport with no fuel surcharge.

I had requested a towncar , and they state "towncar or equivalent. However I was picked up by a smaller SUV. Which they consider a free upgrade.

I booked my return with a competitor for the $55.00 - I tipped cash and was picked up by a Mercedes 350 sedan.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Truly wine tour specialist! When I was planning my trip to San Francisco with my 3 closest friends, I found five Emerald Limousine on yelp which exceeded my expectations.
My friends and I booked a wine tour in Napa and it was great! We hired SUV Cadillac Escalade and it turned out to be best car for Napa wine tasting. We were able to get around quickly from one winery to another in style and comfort. I used to live in Paris and wine tasting is something I love. I would recommend Five Emerald Limo to anyone who wants customized Napa or Sonoma wine tour in a luxury car. Driver was so friendly that he made our wine tasting even more fun!</review>

<review>Mike, Greg, and John worked hard to get me the deal I needed on this 2008 Chevy Tahoe. John keeps his lots stocked with popular models of used cars and trucks, and upgrades many of them with aftermarket parts. This is a used car lot folks, these rigs have miles on them and they aren't all perfect. But they are commonly well equipped, mechanically sound rigs priced at or below blue book, and the finance department is well versed in getting deals done with reputable banks. All in all, good guys to work with and a nice selection of vehicles.<//review>< GmapID>

<review>This is from 2020:
My husband and I just purchased a 2012 Wrangler Jeep at Redding Car and Truck Center. Our salesman was Billy and he was AWESOME! Thank you Billy and Redding Car and Truck Center for helping us choose the right vehicles!

This review is from 2018:
My husband and I just purchased a 2012 Toyota mini van at Redding Car and Truck Center and it was the best time I have ever had when buying a car. Our salesman Mike Hardy was awesome and he did us very fair and then everyone else we dealt with were also very nice and helpful. If you want to buy a new to you (used) car this is a great place to go. Thank you Mike for all of your help. Here is a photo of Mike (the young one) with my husband and the van.< /review><GmapID>0x54d2ecb71c9c9b31:0xa94e635157eb9eed< /GmapID><user>111004991364400558211< /user><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP9uhWH6XKMaDlkGoBUpizsfRZEGhmtXt34DNr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6X4S0g3XypImsIjZd_0f8K1HwVy61Q-DccbNF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Rate>

Purchased my very first car here and couldn’t be happier. Al and Greg were more than willing to meet my needs. They answered all my questions and made it a speedy process. They stayed after hours just so I could leave the lot with my car. I appreciated their help but mostly their kindness. You won’t find better customer service at any other dealership. Thank you Al and Greg!<//text>

We inquired about one of the perks available from the loaded option of dual DVD players in our suburban. Paid an extra 9 k for the loaded model plus paid for the extended warranty to ensure we had coverage if something went wrong. We were assured everything worked. We traded in a vehicle.  When we took it home ( we are 2 hours away) the first time we tried using the DVD players, neither one would work. The unit that plays the movies as well as functions as our GPS is not working. No problem, I've got extended warranty right?, WRONG. They lied about coverage! this is why I asked multiple times before paying extra for the extended warranty. Called to ask about getting it fixed. Turns out they lied about the warranty covering the unit. Feel ripped off. Will have to pay a hefty price out of pocket.. Then I get a letter from a tow company saying I am being billed storage for my trade in. I called and complained they said they would get back to me and fix everything to satisfy our purchase. It's been a year with no results. Don't buy from them .they will smooth talk you while straight up lying to your face. Not to mention we told them we were paying cash and they pulled a credit report and lowered our credit rating when we were about to refinance our house. No reason for a credit pull on a cash transaction. We didn't learn of this till the mortgage company told us. Just another thing they lied about when they said they wouldn't pull one. I explained we didn't want a pull because it lowers your score and if we were a cash sale we didn't need one pulled because we didn't need lender approval. Luckily our scores are high enough that it didn't do to much damage but we were told they wouldn't and they did. Everything they told us was a lie.<//review>< Pics>

Just bought a truck from Redding Car And Truck. Angel was more than helpful and a pleassure to deal with. I drove from the coast to buy the truck and they kept their word and saved the truck for me until I arrived, even know there we're other interested buyers. Angel even returned my rental car for me, he had all the paper work ready and truck fueled up when I arrived. If your interested in buying a truck or car, I suggest checking out Redding Car And Truck and ask for Angel< /review>

Hank was the best! My crazy toddler didn’t bother them. They were flexible with us and made things quick and painless. I’ve bought cars from multiple dealers including carmaxx and I had a wonderful experience here. Hank kept us up to date while he assisted others and made sure he was being attentive to us. Thank you!<//Review>

<text>Good, honest, and clean. Hank, Billy, and the team were willing to help me and my wife through the car buying process as we bought a Suburban for our growing family. They kept their word and fixed small and reasonable issues, that we originally negotiated, by the next day.  I would recommend anyone looking for a car to visit RCAT.< /text><rate>5<//rate><Name>Travis Barlogio<//Name>< gmap_id>

<review>This has been the best car buying experience I've had. Hank is a phenomenal person to work with and stayed over an hour after closing to help close a deal in the time frame I needed. I was given unbeatable pricing, and had an enjoyable experience. I will always buy vehicles here in the future. Highly recommended,  no pressure sales.<//review>< pictures>

We came into Redding Car and Truck Center looking for a Ford F-150. We were walking away from the parking lot and Mark came out and chased us down and said let me find something for you. We found a 2008 ford f150 with only 104,000 miles for a great price. We drove it right away. When we told them we wanted it the guys went to work right away to get us a loan. The guys there are amazing and Mark had all the information we needed to make a decision on buying a truck from them. We are very happy with our choice and their remarkable customer service and knowledge. Thanks guys!< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience truck shopping with Hank! He really valued my price range and what I wanted and helped find the perfect vehicle within my price range, I couldn’t be more happy with my decision in coming here.
Thank you again Hank McDonald< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>5 out of 5 stars. John was a huge help in picking a new truck out and helping me figure out everything I needed to do. He's definitely the reason I walked away with a new truck today. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Nice atmosphere. Definitely would refer this place to anyone looking.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>EDIT: BUYER BEWARE!!! I was prompted to leave my earlier review before I left the dealership and then two days later the check engine light popped up on the vehicle we just purchased. We contacted Billy and they offered nothing except letting us use their mechanic. After determining what code was reading, He said the mechanic knew exactly what code we were talking about. Fairly easy fix but we would have to pay the mechanic instead of them just making it right. I'm fully aware we bought a used vehicle and certain things come with that but this dealership has no integrity and Consumer Affairs is being notified. Unfortunately we will not be buying our next vehicle from RCAT.

Great service! Billy was excellent to work with. Thank you RCAT!<//Text>< username>

<review>Bought a 2017 Chevy 1500 I had them make an agreement to fix the rattle in my exhaust and they never did there response was the wake the agreement was written down does not say we would fix it.First week check engine light came on.  First month and my transmission broke .  Don’t recommend buying from here even if you do buy there warranty which suck by the way. They will promise you it’s the best warranty ever but not really. I thought the truck is pretty new there is no way it can have many problems that was my bad on my part.</review><Name>Juan Alcaraz< /Name>< Date>

I am infuriated  with the outright deception practiced by this company and its representatives. In the first two months of owning a 2015 Chevy Silverado purchased from this dealer we have discovered numerous life safety issues that were present at the date of purchase. While the company did front the cost for ineffective fixes to our vehicle, the price of repairing the truck has become too great for them to handle. Apparently selling an operational vehicle cuts too deeply into their bottom line. It would be my recommendation to make your vehicle purchase elsewhere. You shouldn’t need to be a mechanic with a law degree to avoid getting ripped off by your local car dealership. For those interested in a detailed explanation of our purchase experience<//Text>

I was originally helped by Billy when I first walked onto the lot. Billy was really helpful and informative about all of the vehicles in stock and asked questions to help figure out which vehicle I would be more comfortable driving. The next day I came in to wrap up the paperwork and everything I was helped by Hank because it was Billy's day off. Hank was more then helpful with helping me understand and explaining the details of every aspect of the contract I was signing. Hank was also able to help lower my monthly payments a bit which made the whole experience of buying a car way more comforting, and confident about where I made my purchase.</text>

<Review>Bought a Ram 1500 here about 9 months ago. And so far I’m $4500 deep in truck maintenance, and it’s currently back in the shop getting its transmission looked at which will likely be another $3-5k...I’ve only put 10,000 miles on it...

my technician said this is not the first vehicle he’s seen come in from this dealership. I strongly recommend getting your vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing from these guys.

I would like to assume that these guys were not aware of all of the trucks problems and didn’t do it maliciously... hopefully that is the case. The sales process was very smooth and their customer service was fine. These guys likely just buy anything they can get there hands on for a quick flip without knowing anything about the vehicle itself... not normally one to leave reviews, but maybe I can help someone save thousands on car maintenance?<//Review><rate>2<//rate>< Gmap_id>

Since purchasing the vehicle there have been a few mechanical problems that have since surfaced.  The oil was over filled and over due to be changed.  The Transmission fluid was black.  The tires in the front vibrate.  I have since tried to return the vehicle and he's claiming that I can't.  I'm a single parent and they tried to sale me a lemon and now won't take it back!!  And Hank who sold it to me told me I had two weeks to think it over.  Continued to invite to his home for dinner.... Stay far away from this place.  My next call is to the Better Business Bureau.< /text>

Jerry and Greg are both awesome guys to make a deal with! All staffs are friendly and very welcoming. I would definitely recommend anybody who is wanting to buy a car or truck there for a good deal! Very flexible too also!  Mostly all trucks there have nice upgrades and packages that you would love!</review>

< review>
Bought a truck 5 months ago from here. Nothing but problems from day one. They didn't even bother to change the oli in the truck before I picked it up. They also neglected to cut out the wheel wells for the bigger tires they put on. They also left the tires sensors stock so I was left to deal with that issue also. I have had to have my engine torn down not once but twice in 5 months. Terrible experience. Would highly recommend talking business else where. Oh yeah, and Billy the salesman made me give him a 5 star before he would give me my keys to my truck.Terrible business not worth the time of day.< /review>

We had a great experience buying our truck from these guys ! Hank and Chris were so helpful and straight forward about everything we needed to know. The lobby is extremely family friendly and comfortable. I’d recommend buying a car from this place to any one of my friends and family. Wonderful experience all around.< /Review>

Hank McDonald was the sales man we spoke with on the phone as well as all in person.  He did an amazing job informing us of everything we needed to know, all the options we had and anything we couldn’t think of he already knew.
I wouldn’t have gone anywhere else and I won’t as long as Hank is there.</Review><user_name>McKenziAnn Leber</user_name>< pics>

We received exceptional service! Let me mention that I hate car shopping and buying a vehicle was the last thing I planned to do today. Greg approached my husband and I with a no pressure to buy attitude, but he certainly won over our business. The process was quick and easy and I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.< /Text>

This was my first time buying a used truck. I worked with Hank McDondald who was great to work with. His years in the business shows. He is not pushy and is extremely helpful.</Review>

<Text>We came in kind of knowing what we wanted Hank steered us in the right direction. Showed us vehicles that would fit our budget and which we could easily get financed. We were greeted with smiles and coffee. They worked with our budget and helped us pick out our vehicle. One of the best experiences at any car dealer ship! Would highly recommend to anyone ask for Hank!!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>Purchased a Ford Fusion from them and it’s been problem after problem.. after two days ac went out .. took it back.. back up camera n check engine light came on after a week or so.. their machinists reset the codes n now that it’s having problems n broke down after 3 months they are refusing to assist in any way.. would never recommend this place.

All and all I had a very good experience. I worked with Jerry, very professional as well as respectable. Wasn’t there to put a lot of extra pressure but had the right answers when asked. Not too bad on pricing either.</text>

Hank was the perfect salesman. Not pushy, demanding or salesy at all. He was interested and what we wanted and tried to meet our expectations. Hank and the team not only got my husband the truck he deserved but got us lower payments then we were expecting plus a lower interest rate then we've had in the past.Hank was amazing... I would recommend him to anyone.<//Review>

<Text>The gentleman at redding car and truck gave me the best experience while shopping for a new vehicle. I had just come from another car lot where I was treated very poorly and was not optimistic at all. I was approached by a salesman Hank who was kind friendly and most helpful, and offered nothing but the best service. I left with a new truck , money in my pocket, and a smile on my face. Definatly would recommend checking this place out!</Text><UserId.>107429091472854717654< /UserId.>< Rate>

<review>We just finished purchasing our 2017 diesel truck with Angel and have nothing but great things to report. He was extremely knowledgeable about all the vehicles on the lot and super gracious as we test drove three different trucks. The financing portion was an absolute breeze and Angel made sure to help us get the best deal possible. He has even been wonderful enough to coordinate some additional work and washing the truck and even helping us run an errand. The entire experience has been amazing, one of the best car buying experiences thus far. A huge thank you to Angel and all the team at Redding Car and Truck Center! If you aren’t buying your truck here, you’re definitely making a huge mistake.<//review><gmapID>0x54d2ecb71c9c9b31:0xa94e635157eb9eed<//gmapID>< Pics>

Fell in love with a Tacoma on the website sent my information saying I was interested. Rcvd a call from Hank within 20 minutes to set up a time to come look at it the next day. Hank came in even though he was not feeling well and treated me amazing and helped me get my dream truck! Hank was super friendly, I felt like I could trust him and like he was treating me as a family or friend. Great service!! I highly recommend Redding Car and Truck center and especially Hank!<//review>

This place has a lot of cool trucks to choose from and they’re always getting new stuff in. Jerry helped me out and made sure I got into something I liked, and even replaced a broken key fob for me a few days later (thought it was just a dead battery before). Great place, would recommend. Jerry will take care of you!< /Text>

Came in knowing what I wanted, and they had it for a great price! Never having bought a car before Hank helped me every step of the way. Even keeping my three rambunctious kids busy. Amazing customer service. Highly recommend.< /review>

SHOUT OUT TO BILLY- who sold us a truck, guaranteeing it was solid, and sent us on our 3 hour journey home with two small children- knowing it was all kinds of messed up! The motor isn't any good. In the end Im paying $4k in this initial repair alone! Great DEAL!- we could have had a terrible accident on that ride home, but hey you made your sale; am I right? AVOID AT ALL COSTS- THEY ARE DISHONEST CON ARTISTS</Text>

My husband and I bought a 2012 Chevy Suburban today and our experience was amazing! Mike was our sales representative and he answered all of our questions and more. We didn't have that pushy experience that we all are terrified of. He was easy going and no pressure. Also, Greg, sales manager worked hard getting us approved. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

The car dealership was great. Very clean, and they take care of their vehicles and are very understanding. They are very fast with the paperwork and they also go over everything and cover what the paperwork covers. Hank was great with explaining the vehicle and all the aspects of the vehicle. I would recommend this dealership for teenagers and people buying their first vehicle.< /text>

Good people and they will reason with you. I would recommend having your vehicle inspected before purchasing so that way you know what you might need to possibly fix and include it in your budget. Overall very friendly service and would highly recommend.< /Review>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>I was in a hurry went down on my lunch test drove a car, Angel wrote up all the paper work and i was able to pick up right after work and still get my daughter to her practice. Went back the following day they were able to help me out with a warranty stuff. All around a good experience.

EDIT TO MY PREVIOUS 5 STAR review.
So only reason they received 2 star is because they did process everything quick for me. The 2 days following buy a car, I was driving to Red Bluff car was running fine but just so happens that after i put a 100 or so miles on the car the check engine light comes on 100 miles happens to magic number that it takes for a code to come back after unplugging the battery or clearing with a code reader. Fortunately I happen to work on cars and work for a company where I can get parts for cheap. In my previous review they had told me they would call me about the warranty that they advertise at the lot, well that never happened. 3 weeks later I get a call from them, they don't remember me they think they are calling to try and sell a car. I explained that I already bought a car but never received a call back about the warranty , the sales rep quickly pushed that off and said the finance guy would call me about... never happened.

My honest opinion is they have inventory but I wouldn't pay asking price. There are plenty of used car lots in this town so If you can't get a car from them for what you feel is a fair price just walk. this is the 3rd used car in 3yrs I've bought and the only time that I have to leave a negative review.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Wonderful and friendly service! Hank was very knowledgeable about the vehicles on the property and helped narrow down from dozens of choices to find the right car that worked for me. The vehicles are fairly priced and are being well taken care of while under their care. Would strongly recommend checking RCTC for your next car!< /review>

<Text>My experience at Redding Car & Truck Center was phenomenal! Angel reached out through text, after I made an inquiry online about a vehicle that interested me. Angel worked tirelessly and efficiently to help secure the best deal, regarding my monthly insurance and car payments. Thank you very much for all your help! You made my purchase experience enjoyable and talked me through each detail. Thank you, thank you, thank you!😊 I would most definitely recommend Redding Car & Truck Center for all your used car needs.< /Text></record>

Redding car and truck Center
generally has pretty good vehicle's.
they're not driven super high on the mileage having 200,000 plus miles on their vehicles.
this is why I give them four stars they don't sell junk !
You know your car is going to last more than a year
or two ,
and that's important .
because money is hard to come by nowadays.
When it comes to financing there a typical dealer .
you're going to want at least two
or two and a half Grand down that's pretty much the standard nowadays and of course credit .
depends on that is if you get the car or not that's kind of a given as well.
But you can shop there with peace of mind because you know what you're looking at on the lot is good quality used vehicle's.
Some of them in the back are great deals runabouts......smaller vehicle's.
And of course in the front
we have the toys
the really big trucks that everybody wants they have a great selection of those and they're not scratched up and banged up these trucks look nice!
And don't forget .
they have a sister  lot
they have a lot number two .
a lot of people don't know about that.
So if you're looking for a gently used vehicle without 200 something thousand miles on it. and it's not all banged up
this might be a place you want to check out.</text>

I purchased a vehicle just over a year ago, and had a terrible buying experience. I now have spent thousands on repairs since with less than 10,000 miles driven. I won't be back, needless to say. Highly recommend against buying here
Here's an update. Engine just blew up less than 12000 miles driven. Kept up on all maintenance. Dealership sells junk.  I'm sure they're laughing at this post. Absolute nightmare.  Don't go through what I have. Avoid this place at all costs.< /text><userid>105240919945420365302<//userid><Response>None< /Response><time>1575993029811</time><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Overall service was great! Billy Teusher is a very nice guy. Very patient and amazingly helpful. He provided an outstanding service and we’ll definitely recommend him. Big thank you to Redding Car and Truck Center’s owner for making it happen! My brother walked out with his dream car, Mustang Ford! Unbelievable deal of the day!< /Review>

<review>Updated review....get every vehicle from here inspected by a mechanic before buying!!!!  Buyer beware!  The truck we purchased had massive rust disguises with a thick black coat and black paint.  We took the truck to a reputable collision repair specialist.  They would not even touch the truck for repairs because it was so horribly rusted that they couldn't gaurentee the outcome of the repairs.  Thank goodness for the cancellation contract.  Cost us 500.00 to get our vehicle back that we traded to them in good faith 😡.  Side note....they conveniently forgot to copy and give us a copy of the cancellation agreement that we signed.  Intitially they weren't even going to take the truck back even though we had the cancellation agreement.  A very shady business.

Hank was very knowledgeable and helpful in getting us hooked up with a truck to pull our new trailer.

Hank was very knowledgeable and helpful.  He worked very hard to get us into the truck we needed to pull our new trailer.  He even worked a great deal for us on our trade in!<//review></record>

Recently bought a car here. Hank was very accommodating and patient with us even when we changed our minds when the deal was 95 % complete. Ended up with a car we are all happy with. Thank you!</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><resp>None<//resp><Date>1545665640869</Date><Review>I previously purchased a vehicle from them through sales man mike Hardy. He was professional and I was happy with the vehicle. So much so that when my mother in law had her vehicle totaled by an uninsured motorist I brought her to them. Once again Mike did a great job. He even overcame a potential deal breaker and made it work. The management, Mike Hardy and Mike at the shop are a really good team. If you like affordable vehicles with good customer service; look no further than Redding car and truck center.</Review>< Name>

Hank is a great guy to go see if you're looking for a new or used vehicle! They may look like a small company but they have a fast turn around so if you see something you like, go in and talk to him!< /Review>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>This dealership is top notch.  They have a great selection of used trucks, most of which are customized with lift kits and rims with big tires.  I needed to sell my ram 2500 that had a lift kit and accessories.  They helped me see my truck for top dollar and did it in less then a week.  I highly recommend Redding Car and Truck Center to anyone in Northern California looking for a great deal on a fine used vehicle.
Keep up the good work.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< username>

<text>My daughter and I bought a great car at a fair price on 10/19/18 and had the BEST experience working with Jordan O’Dell.
He was kind, respectful and answered all of our questions like the pro he is. I would recommend checking out the vehicles they have in stock and ask for Jordan!! Thank you Jordan for a great first time car buying experience for my 19 yr old daughter. God Bless You :)</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I went to Redding car and truck center looking for a truck for work. I was greeted by Angel. Angel was friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful. He showed me some trucks that were at a great price. I decided I wanted a truck they had and he got me in it no problem. My credit score wasn't the best but he pulled some strings, worked hard, and made it happen. Thanks Angel. I love the truck.<//text>

I just recently bought a lifted chevy suburban for my wife. Our sales rep mike was amazing. He was down to earth,very easy going person who answered all my questions. Never at any point was he ever pushy. He made my wife and i feel right at home and very comfortable the intire time. I would highly recommend buying a car here and i look forward to buying my next truck here.< /Review>

Great place and great selection. We worked with Jordan and he was awesome, made everything super easy and got us a sweet deal on our truck. Couldn't be happier with the experience down here. It's nice working with salseman who aren't pushy or annoying. Jordan was a breath of fresh air.<//review>

<Text>Mike Hardy was honest, low-key and stayed late to make sure we ended up with the truck we wanted. When he found out U-Haul's quote was cheaper for installing a tow package, he recommended we go with them rather than their own shop. Looking forward to driving this truck.< /Text>< Pictures>

This lot always catches my eye when I pass it and yesterday I finally pulled in. I was greeted by Jordan and he was awesome! Showed me around the lot listened to what I wanted and got me an excellent suv at an excellent price. I will definitely be going back if I need vehicles in the future and I would definitely be dealing with Jordan!< /text>

Also, we looove the fish tanks!<//text>

Angel was an incredible help with showing me all of the different vehicles and possibilities there were. We were there for a short amount of time and out the same day with the truck of our dreams! If you are looking for a place to buy a nice clean vehicle Redding Car and Truck is the place to go! Ask for Angel he is a huge help.<//text>

Angel was great. He took care of us and wasn't pushy or annoying. You almost can't even look away from his beard it is that glorious but His man bun needs a little work. Would buy from him again.</text>

Happen to spot a truck I was interested in and stopped in. Angel Gotay was extremely helpful and honest. I ended up not liking the original truck but they got me in a better one for a great deal! Very clean showroom and ultra friendly staff. Highly recommend.</Text>

Showed up not knowing what to expect. But Jordan the salesman made it a super easy process after I test drove the pickup I was eyeing. Smooth process in & out in a couple of hours with a newer vehicle! Thanks</review>

<Text>My brother in law purchased a truck from Redding Car and Truck not too long ago. He recommended I stop by and talk to Angel Gotay when I was ready to buy. I went in today and was assisted by Angel. His customer service was great! He was straight forward and fair to us. Also very knowledgeable on their inventory. I left with a truck and am a very happy customer. Thanks Angel.< /Text><Response>None<//Response><Rating>5</Rating>< user>

Bought an suv less than a year ago.. have had one problem after another with it.. still owe 8k on it and running out of money trying to fix it. After the first week it was an oil leak, and was told it wasn't smoked in yet found cigarette burns in the carpet, buttons in it don't work.. its been tons of things since then.. just yesterday got the radiator replaced. I would not recommend buying any vehicle from them.. never again.</Text>

Myself and the family where doing an outing yesterday and decided to stop and look at trucks. After finding what we liked and dealing with Billy Teuscher I would highly recommend stopping  the Redding Car and Truck center ask for Billy he was honest from the beginning. And yes I'm taking home my Silverado thanks Billy.< /review>

We had a great experience buying our SUV at Redding Car and Truck Center. Mike was a great help and in the end we really did get a great deal. They we're very helpful and took the time to answer the questions we had about purchasing our warranty. Great experience, thank you Redding Car and Truck Center. We love our new Ford Explorer.<//Review>

I would definitely buy a used car here if you want one that you find was sold with dangerously bad breaks, one that has catalytic converters that fail after one week, and after spending more time with the mechanic than on the road you find out the engine needs to be replaced. We found out that anyone who buys a used car in California has basically no rights and you are stuck with whatever problems the seller stuck you with. And although we did get some help from the dealer, they also told us they would help us on other things that they did not. I would not take a chance on buying any vehicle from this dealer!< /text>

Idk what was going on but definitely not a great experience at this dealership. I came wanting a truck and ready to buy yet my lady and I sat there for 2+ hours and nothing. They let me test drive one truck and I liked it but when we got back we we're still just waiting around. I walked in several times to let them know hey I'm ready to get this going. One was watching TV the other dealing with the same customer, the guy who rode with us during the test drive, had told us they weren't even sure he was buying. Three guys and not one wanted to sell us a truck. They did not take us seriously I guess and I ended up leaving and telling them if they wanted to sell me a truck to call me, to which they still have not. Luckily for us we found a way nicer truck for about the same price the very next lot we went to. Just hope they know their terrible customer service earned their competition 22k that could've been theirs.<//text>

<text>Very helpful and willing to discuss or consider just about anything - my experience is that they really want the customer to have a good sales experience. I haven't finalized a deal yet, but my experiences with them iver the last few days if looking at cars, test drive, and listening to them deal with other customers is enough for me to recommend people to check out this dealership if you're looking for a car.</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Name>

Angel and Jordan helped big time in getting our family car, which eventually became a Honda Pilot. We got good advice in the pros and cons of the various options available and the necessary time was taken to show us the various cars, test drive, etc.... nice people, can so far warmly recommend< /text>

<date>1531183084495<//date><Review>Stopped by Redding Car and Truck center this afternoon to look at a Jeep my husband and I thought he might be interested in.
A very nice salesman approached and offered to assist us. We looked at several cars and trucks all afternoon and in the end purchased a beautiful truck and he got us an AWESOME DEAL!
I must say we have purchased many cars over the years and this was by far the most pleasant and the easiest, mostly due to Angel...our salesman. He got us the deal we wanted and went above and beyond for us. Stop in and see Angel at Redding Car and Truck Center If you are in need of a vehicle, he’ll do a great job to get you a great vehicle and a great deal!!!!<//Review>< gmap_id>

If I had a choice their would be no stars at all. Stay away from this dealership.  They are shady and tell you whatever you want to hear.  I wanted to make a deal on a vehicle they were selling but they wouldn't make a deal until they had all my personal information.  I told them not to run my credit until I got a fair deal on the vehicle. Angel the salesmen swore to me they would not run my credit until I gave them permission . Anyways they were not going to give me a decent price on the vehicle I wanted so I walked away. And they ended up running my credit anyways. Like I said they are shady and don't trust them. Stay away</text>

<Text>Would not recommend this business. Felt they were unprofessional. The owner as well as two salesmen looked at my trade in and offered me the full amount of its value. Then went back and wanted it for a grand less. We came up with terms for the vehicle we were interested in and were all in agreeance. They told us now we just had to wait to be approved by the bank. After waiting 3 days and (US CALLING TO KEEP UPDATED) not hearing from them at all, we were approved by the bank. They then decided they wanted more money out of us then the original agreement. Redding Car and Truck are not a company that you can trust to stand by their word, such a disappointment. Don't waste your time or spend your hard earned money supporting a business that is not loyal to what they say, just wants to make as much as they can out of you.<//Text><Name>Effortlessly Steph< /Name><user_id>105667625111600715650< /user_id>< rating>

I reccomend dealing with Mike Hardy at Redding Car & Truck Center not only was he a nice guy but he was a straight shooter everything he told me I double checked and verfied and he was truthful every time. I'm definitely happy I went through him becuase the last salesman at the other car lot was not knowledgeable and tried to pressure me so I'm glad I went through Mike Hardy At Redding Car And Truck Center....<//Review>

As a first time buyer I’ve heard horror stories about car salesmen, so I was a bit skeptical walking in. I meet with Angel Gortay and it was smoth sailing! Angel was very professional, straight forward and very informative. I experienced a great transaction and got a killer truck! Even after the transaction was finalized Angel treats me the same. My calls are just as important! Right on brother! Thank you Angel!<//Review>

Billy Teuscher saved our bacon in a sense.  We broke down in our 2001 Subaru outback in WinCo parking lot, 60 plus miles from home.  Repairs were going to cost $1500.  I decided to entertain the idea in using that money as a down payment on a "newer" car and trade in the the old car.  It was time.  Here is how it went down....
Billy picked us up at WinCo, brought us to dealership, showed us a 2009 Subaru Forester.  He met my down payment, met my monthly payment and stayed well after 7pm closing time to make a deal happen.  Thank you Billy for taking care of us.  ~ The Hight Family< /review>

We have had a great experience working with Angel Gotay at Redding Car and Truck today. He was super helpful and patient with my husband and I while we worked through the process of purchasing a new vehicle. I highly recommend stopping by if you are looking for a new car.< /Review>

Some salesman are honest and some flat out lie about anything. Doesn't matter what you have in mind, they want $2500 cash.  If you don't have $2500 cash, go somewhere else.< /Review><Name>mjcentury21< /Name>< pictures>

I purchased a Toyota Avalon from Angel at Redding Car and Truck center a year ago in July 2017. At the time, I thought I was getting a deal on a car that would last me a while. I was told the car had been checked out and all issues were fixed. By April of 2018, I had already put more than $1,700 into fixing major issues with the car, and this month, I have finished putting in another $900. These have been major, can't miss, functional issues with the vehicle.
When I called to question their honesty, I was told directly from Angel "This is a business and we are just making money here." I was lied to and cheated out of every hard earned penny I had saved to purchase my car. I'm incredibly disappointed in the salesmen and the management of this lot. Do not give them your business. They don't deserve to be in this town. Terrible place to go.</Text>

The salesman was very nice and accommodating pre sale. There were issues with the pick up we were buying (the ABS Brake light was on) and they told us they fix that stuff only if someone is interested. SO...they wrote it on the Due Bill that if we purchased, they would take care of fixing the brakes. Their work is outsourced to a shop across town, left my truck for the day, the part was ordered, we then called 3x to the shop to arrange the actual brake repair. No call back, 2nd time pick up and hang up, 3rd time "I'll call you back." (about when to complete the repair). Meanwhile it's 3 weeks later, the brakes are fluttering when used, possibly very dangerous... we finally said forget it and fixed the brakes ourselves. My husband went into the store in the midst of this and was not met with the same warm smiles and welcome as was the case before the sale. Needless to say, we are not impressed with the follow through "customer service."< /review>

Billy Teuscher was great to work with. Best automobile buying experience yet! Billy is knowledgeable and friendly. No hassle auto buying! John Dinning stocks his lots with a great variety of quality used cars and trucks . Check out the new location at the corner of Bechelli and Hartnell! Highly recommend this business !<//review>

The staff at Redding Car and Truck Center are easy to work with and made my recent truck purchase a great experience. Conner Skoglund is a fine young man and make customers feel invite the moment you set foot on the lot. He went beyond what you would usually see at a car dealership. He made sure not to pressure or speed up the sale. Billy Teuscher made the numbers work and he was good and did his part. I would recommend these guys to anyone looking for a quality auto. Thanks !

Gerald was great! Helped me with all the details and didn't push the sale.  Polite, professional, and efficient. I'm happy with my purchase and how I was treated.</Review>

< review>
Purchased a truck from Redding Car and Truck two months ago. I asked to see the pre-sale inspection report and the sales person stated, "We don't do that." They did provide me with a list of repairs they had made and guaranteed me, "We wouldn't sell it if it had issues. Our name is on the line." That being said, they have a list of repairs they still need to make and I have not heard a word from them.
Brake issues, door panel and dash are broken, washer fluid reservoir is broken, heater doesn't work, gas guage doesn't work, electrical issues and the list goes on.
I have text messages from the salesperson apologizing for selling me such a mess of a vehicle. I've called Mike to see what is going on with the repairs and he said he would order parts. Never heard from him again. No date as to when the parts will arrive or when the truck will be repaired.
Poor customer service.

I had a wonderful experience here at Redding Car and Truck, they did everything in the power to get me my car and it came through. Super helpful people and when you go in definitely ask for Gerald best salesman there, highly recommend this place over any big dealership.<//review>

<Text>I would not recommend this place to anyone. Dealing with Mike at first then Angel and John we found that their word with a customer meant nothing to them. They were supposed to check a credit union for us that we recommended and found out the following day they never did it so we had to do it ourselves. OUR Credit Union gave us a 4% lower percentage than anyone that Redding Truck and Auto found. The credit union issued a check for the truck we had picked out and then found out that the employees at Redding truck and auto center sold the truck that morning that we had agreed to buy. The employees that we spoke to after this happened were very rude to us and when our credit union called them about it they were even rude to them. This all transpired after we had been in contact on a daily basis and several times a day. Again I would not recommend this business to anybody but if you decide to go there be very very very careful of what is said and agreed upon.< /Text>< pics>

This place is a joke save your time! Went there to look at a car, and got the worst service ever! No one what they are talking about, and they will talk circles around everything!! Don't use MIKE either he has no idea what he is doing. Waste of time for sure wish I never even looked at a car they had!! Be careful if you use this place!!</review>

I’m 19 young kid and I’ve been working with Angel Gotay for a week or so now I’ve been in a few times and he was able to get me in on a badass 2012 Chevy Silverado I am super stoked on it and cannot believe that he was able to make something happen for me. I was originally going for a 2005 Chevy and he worked some magic and got me into a 2012 could not be happier with the service and clientele at rcat in Redding be smart and go down there and work with angel and get yourself a nice truck!!<//Text>

Had the amazing opportunity of buying our 2nd Truck here, Angel Gotay (Sales Associate) was awsome and very friendly. Overall the process was fast. This place is very inviting, they had a nice selection of Trucks.</review>

Pretty awesome little lot, lots of high mileage units (seems to be their niche) just make sure you check the vehicles out well and make sure you look at their sales prices online because the salesmen will try to sell above that price.</text>

Would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a vehicle. Overpriced and not willing to go the extra mile to be helpful! I spent 3 days on the phone after submitting a credit app trying to figure out if I qualified they never called back and were extremely rude when I finally got ahold of them! Bad business and i will gladly be taking my business elsewhere!</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Terrible customer service there car's are overpriced for how old they are and there not at all willing to work with you on dealing. Was given the run around mulitiple times with 1 excuse after another while they made false claims. No one there knows what there doing and not 1 single employee has the decency to do there own work they make others do it for them. In result to this they lost buissness and a chance to sell a car. Unless you want the same issues and experience I had DONT GO here to buy a car. Save yourself the stress and aggony of dealing with these idiots</Review><time>1500909345114< /time>< pictures>

Waste of time when it comes to this place. Drove a good distance after being in touch with Angel. After we drove 3+ hours to check out a car on the lot he said " Oh that was sold yesterday I'm so sorry." He could have at least given me a heads up but made up some acuse for not. They have no care for customers or have and customer serive skills in addition to any knowledge of cars. Don't waste your time, money, or life with this place. What a joke. Also I doubt that any of there postitve feedback is true wouldn't be surpirsed if it they were all from friends of the workers.< /review>

<Review>Was hesitate to even come in because they always have the expensive trucks out front..but we checked online and they had some less expensive trucks to sell..The salesman that helped answered all of our questions and was very informed on the vehicles and their history..If your looking for a truck you should check them out, its worth it..And would like to thank Mike Hardy for making it an easy buy..thank you<//Review>< gmap_id>

Nope! That's all I have to say. You'll see if you deal with them. Very friendly but the deals are not great and they have a lack of knowledge about there vehicles.< /Review>

This dealership lies to me and the bank. Do not buy from them. They sold me a lemon of a truck. I took it to a mechanic just after leaving the lot. The ABS is out, the starter is going, the fuel filter is clogged, and they didn't change the oil.</Text>
