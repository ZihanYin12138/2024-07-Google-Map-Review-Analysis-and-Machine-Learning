Great team on site who are pretty attentive, kind and responsive. I had some minor issues while moving in but they were taken care of pretty quickly and without much effort. Moved in recently and so far it has been a great experience!< /text>

< Review>
Secondhand smoking issue is all over this community especially during COVID. Strong cigarette smells during the day and night.

The landlord fail to resolve the secondhand smoking situation. My asthma has been worse since living with some neighbor who smokes cigarette at late night.

It is a smoke-free community that fails to address smoking problem, despite I've been emailing them since February.

After confirming on the internal rental platform, more than 5 people have been experienced that. Which is really shocking that they still have such a high rating on Google while in Yelp they only have 3 stars. Suspicious.<//Review>

Just moved in to this expensive apartment a week ago and hope to enjoy life. And after a day, I was washing grapes with a white bowl and found that I was never be able to wash the grapes clean. Plus the bath gel seemed harder to wash during shower. I started to doubt about the hot water and yes! it was brown.

Requested service and after two days I got a notes left on the table saying everything was fine . Check! Check!. As a handy person, I just bought a hose and tried to drain the heat tank, just out of engineer's curiosity. OMG, I never saw this kind of dirty heater tank in my whole life (I owned a house before and did flush few times myself, the first time was after ~3 years of using), and showed the NICE water to the leasing office,  they asked me to come back in 30 mins. After 30mins, the office was closed in the frond and found one of sales person at "lunch" at the club room? it was 3pm, anyway, he said he was at lunch, I could see that but he turned the back to me and I said "ok, I could wait". After a min, he saw I was waiting and  was not willing to leave at all and he called the maintenance to see me in my room.

Ok, we did full drain the tank, the whole tank is like a LAVA!!!!!!! attached few pictures after the first burst, I missed the best ones. But it is good enough to feel it from these too. Also flushed three times from half tank with cold water. Now, we could at least see the bottom of the basket we were using to check the water. And the maintenance person said the hot water should be fine after the settlement. But to be frank, after you see the water from the tank, this heater has to be replaced for sure 200%. After another two days of suffering the brown water, nothing gets better. Drained again, the bottom of the tank is still like lava + now big white segments can be seen. And since this apartment was rented by seniors for 16 years, I bet the tank had never been serviced for 16 years !!!! Poor people and did not find the water they were using is like this. I hope they are still fine.

Also the original 16 year old dryer takes me two hours to dry a half loaded clothes.... "Great" too for a $3600 apartment!

Request to replace the heat water tank and the dryer!! and will see how long it will take to fix this and I will update the post....If it is complete, I can give more stars, now it is zero!!! I am not sure why this place is rated 4.6. Unbelievable to me at least for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated on 2/15/2017

Thanks for Google reviews' impact and I got phone call right on Monday morning (compared with two days) and discussed the problem again and blabla I should have gone to the office to see them. I DID already! but nobody took care of me. I dont want to bring my basket again with the dirty water and stand there like a homeless. So I got the promise to get the heater replaced on Tuesday and also they will look the dryer.
I thought this was the end of the problem and we will move on. No. They cleaned the vent of the dryer and I tried again. It gets better but still not great just like my score here 3 out of 5. On Tuesday, got an email from the Director of the service, saying they were still trying to troubleshooting the heater and flushing more water and it was not THAT OLD... blabla.. I could not hold my anger when I saw his email signature "how home should feel"... What a joke!  NO WAY!! I spent another 20 mins to reply the email as well as my wife and we planned to move out from this place! Finally, the general manager spoke up and the new heater was installed eventually. Thank God. Why? Why so difficult to replace a 500 buck heater...Still not 100% clean I guess the pipe also takes time to flush out. But you feel it getting much better, no bad smell at least! Again I think 3 stars is the best I can give no matter what and it is very generous. From the day we moved in until the day the heater problem got fixed, we suffered exactly 10 days! Readers can judge by yourselves. Thanks for reading all my angry words and sorry too.< /Text>

<Date>1611031794342</Date><Review>Moving to Park Place in Oct. 20'  for the location and accessibility although most amenities were not available due to covid.  Living here has been what you can expect for the times, simple and straight forward.  However there has been ONE true superstar, Sam the Maintenance Manager.  This guy is not only the most handy of all men but his customer service goes above and beyond anything you could expect.

I had a problem with my toilet on a Friday and had a guy there that evening as well as Sam on the phone/in-person and the same evening to ensure things were done correctly.  Understanding the importance of a toilet problem in a one bedroom apartment.  Long story short, Sam shopped a new toilet and had it installed himself by Tuesday.  In addition, three other issues including one on Christmas Eve that he once again answered the call and handled accordingly.

Sam and his maintenance staff are courteous, knowledgeable and timely to say the least.  Thanks again!<//Review>< Pictures>

Great service provided by Sam. Sam from day one was very informative about what was going on with this on-going issue that we had with our shower before Sam worked at our complex site. He took his time to resolve the issue and not rush through it just to get the job done. I could tell that Sam really wanted to get to the root of the problem. I am very pleased with his work in our apartment. Besides the work Sam performed, he also supervised other workers and vendors and made sure they did their part correctly to repair the other issues we had related to the shower. Sam also helped us fix other issues without any hesitation. I know he kept telling me it was "his job," but I could tell he also took PRIDE in what he did!< /text>

I lived here for a year. 2 stars for nice and renovated apartments, nice locations and repairs completed rapidly (only ever had 1 issue with the shower which was fixed within 2 hours).

However, I had a really negative experiences with a number of staff members. I would consider the treatment incredibly disrespectful, not because of people being deliberately rude but for the reasons explained below.

1)	In the one year I lived here I had 3 leasing consultants due to rapidly changing staff, this was very confusing to me and not surprisingly the assigned staff did not seem properly trained to address my issues in addition to being very unresponsive:
-	I had continuous upstairs noise issues during the later 9/12 months of my lease to the point of being woken up almost every night, sometimes up to three times. These could not be resolved by talking to the neighbors in person and through the leasing office so I asked for a transfer 9 months into my lease. “Consultant 2” told me they would fix the issue instead.
-	7 weeks before the end of my lease I told new “Consultant 3” I would either transfer to a top floor apartment or move since the noise only got worse. Short story: The 4-5 available top floor apartments were rented out within the next 3 weeks while failing to negotiate, communicate or respond to me about this issue. It is beyond me, given the time, how this could go wrong. I had to consistently show up at the office during a pandemic due to the phone not being picked up and emails not being responded to. It has nothing to do with my record since I don’t have any late payments and am a very quiet resident.

2)	Move out inspection: made an appointment, the person did not show up. My email if they are still showing up today got an “out of office” response and was never responded to.

3)	The front elevator was broken down both at move in and move out, an additional $300-500 of moving costs due my movers having to do a hike with my furniture, in addition to the already extensive moving costs caused by disturbed nights and a pretty rough year. But of course $350 of my deposit was used for cleaning, which I already expected from previous reviews.<//Text>

A few weeks ago Amanda A. (General Manager) and Sam D. (General Service Director) stopped by my apartment to take a look at my kitchen floor since I had leak issues from the past.  Both felt it was important to replace the entire floor in my unit.  I was very happy and impressed with the service I received from both of them.  They generally cared and wanted to make sure I was happy with the outcome.  Thank you both for the great service you provided to me.  I am forever grateful.</text>

Charged us a 107 dollar "early termination fee". We gave them keys back 1 day before lease end after being requested to return keys when we were ready.

We were not told about this fee. If someone said, keep your keys for an extra day and save 100 bucks we would have done it. Pathetic money grab. Lease end on july 13. Keys returned on july 12. Got charged an early termination fee.

Sam and the rest of facilities are great though.<//text>

We moped the floor, clean the rooms in and out, wiped the wall, but still got charged both Cleaning and Painting! Unbelievable! Also, the carpet was pretty out dated and they charge the replacement fee as well! That’s more than 1000 in total without any explanations! Please reconsider before you move in.

The parks  on the property offer some greenery that I didn't think I would enjoy as much as I do; and having a pool and jacuzzi is always a plus!

Packages are sometimes hard to find; but I think that's because they are sometimes not recorded properly by the people delivering them and also, some of the other residents make a mess of it more when trying to look for their packages.

<review>Most friendly and helpful Assistant Community Manager ever goes to Daniel Fairbanks, so lovely and great first impression of the apartments. He definitely made a great experience for us especially being here for the first time. We looked at so many apartments for the past weeks and definitely found a place we can call home. The apartments are well maintained and cleaned. We fell in love with the hardwood floors and the spacious patios but also the staff here at Park Place at San Mateo make you feel like you already part of the community. We were looking for a cozy place, somewhere close from work and we definitely found the right place. Meghan the Community Manager was very helpful as well and very outgoing and easy going, she makes you feel like you are just part of the community already. She made us feel comfortable and happy on making the decision of moving in. We really appreciate the work that Daniel and Meghan do for this community. We looking forward in having a great living experience at our new home. Daniel thank you for being one of a kind guy and make us laugh a couple times and just making us feel like we belong there. I highly recommend everybody before making a decision to check out these apartments and look beyond especially on what amenities are offered. You may find a cheaper place anywhere but the quality of service of the staff and the amenities they offered is pretty damn good. Thank you Park Place at San Mateo, we look forward in moving in this month!!<//review>< Pics>

As I just moved in, I’m m not familiar with almost everything. When I ask for help, they always give me a hand which I appreciated very much.

We've been living in this apartment complex for more than 2 years and would keep staying here for much more. ​

The staff is absolutely superior and treats you like a family member. In our case, all the issues with appliances or windows we had were solved instantaneously​ and without any arguments. When we were required to move to a 2 bedroom apartment before our 1 bedroom apartment lease was over, the management allowed us doing this without any questions.

Thanks for​ such a great ambiance​ and cozy place!< /review>

The only sound insulation is between side-by-side units. There is absolutely no insulation between you and your upstairs neighbors. Pair that with families who think it's acceptable to turn the apartment into a 24-hour bounce house, and you have a nightmare situation. If this apartment is your only option, I highly suggest you only consider top floor units. We have been unable to relax at home for over 7 months.

Edit (Nov 12, 2018):
I am pretty surprised Park Place left the response below. Park Place is very well aware of our complaints, and so far no changes have been made. We have been making complaints since May. Over the past month, we have been sending them recordings (~100 clips) of the noise generated. You can hear our neighbors beating on the floor over my conference call. You can hear sprinting over our white noise generator. You can hear someone body slam the floor over our TV. We have also called security when the neighbors were out of control. We are aware that Amanda has read our emails (because we have the Gmail Streak plug in installed that tells you when/where the email was read). We asked Amanda to email us what the next steps are, and we haven’t heard back since.

Although it is clear our neighbors are making no effort to curtail the noise generated, we realize that it is tough for a family to move. That’s why WE have offered to move in the middle of our lease. Moving is expensive and painful, but living under this family is worse. Equity Residential WILL NOT LET US MOVE WITHOUT PAYING A PENALTY OF > $4650 (1.5x our monthly lease). They also want to penalize us a FULL MONTHS RENT to move into a different unit.

Either the person who wrote the response to my review doesn’t work at Park Place, or it was a half-hearted attempt to look like they care. They don’t.</text>

Great experience at Park Place!  Very clean upon move in, upgraded unit in area with every amenity you need -- either in PP or within a block or two.  Huge patio for my fluffy best friend to frolic - with great light and fresh air.  Office staff is wonderful and maintenance system is super quick (and staff friendly)!  If I wasn't moving to another city for a job, I'd be there still.  Thanks to Daniel for taking amazing care of me as a resident and throughout my exit process; flawless!< /Review>

We loved our experience while moving. Daniel Fairbanks helped us through the process and made it the easiest process in the world. He was so understanding of our busy schedule and even stayed pass office hours to show me around the property.

Even after moving in, there were a few things i needed fixed in our unit and with the Help of Edy, Daniel and the rest of there team took care of my concerns very quickly and were very good about communication and keeping me in loop.

The property is kept very clean. Property staff is very pleasant and polite. We love our new home.<//Review>

<Review>I have been here for almost one year and this has been the best experience. From the moment I walked the area I knew I was going to like living here. The front office is great especially Dan and Ruth. Anytime I need a service request or a question they are on top of it. If I have a question they get back to me real fast.  Great place place to live especially with all the restaurants and whole foods within walking distance. I can't wait for the pool to be fixed up. My apartment is great...its a one bedroom but it a good size. Pet friendly too. Overall I would recommend Park Place as a great place to live.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Park Place is a wonderful place to live !  Daniel Fairbanks is amazing and so helpful in every way when we toured the apartments, through the selection process and with every detail of the move-in.  Dan even sent me pictures and room measurements for planning purposes as I was moving from Virginia.  Everyone in the Leasing Office is very friendly and helpful also.  Park Place is centrally located and in a wonderful community setting but still close to the 101 and 92.< /Review>< username>

Park Place San Mateo offers a great value for a modern and comfortable rental home in the Bay Area!  The community is well maintained with easy access to shops and services either within walking distance or just a short drive away.  There's a gym with 24 hour access as well as a jacuzzi and pool to enjoy during the summer.  Most importantly, the staff at Park Place are amazing!  They are attentive, helpful, and patient in answering all questions regarding the community big or small.  There are countless perks living at Park Place and I will truly miss having called this community my home for over a year.  :)</Review>

We just moved to Park Place and Dan F has been wonderful in helping us get settled.  He's been easy to get a hold of to answer my questions prior to moving in and has followed up to make sure all has been well.  Ruth has been great to work with also.  I love the location and the other tenants have been very friendly.  The place is well kept  and clean.  I would definitely recommend this place:)</review>

We had a great experience at this Community.  We stayed here short term while our house was being remolded.  The community is close to restaurants, shopping, and highways.  The apartments have more of a home feel which made the time away much easier.  I can't say enough about the staff as well. AMAZING! We will recommend the Park Place Community to anyone looking for an apartment in San Mateo!<//text>

The management is engaging and adept.  The only reason we are not staying is because of the lack of sound buffering.  We can hear EVERYTHING the upstairs neighbor is doing from walking to talking to opening drawers and using the bathroom. If you are not sensitive to noise then this place is fabulous.  But if you are, then forget being able to relax at home.  Very disappointed it did not work out here.< /Text>< Pics>

We recently relocated from out of the country and found Park Place online. My son was very excited to have a pool and gym. Just a heads up the pool is under construction and was not noted on the website so this has been disappointing. On a positive note we met Dan and he has really helpful during our transition. Amanda & Abbie in the office is very helpful too. We look forward to the pool opening soon. We look forward to living here.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Living at the Park Place apartments was a great experience.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend leasing .  It is located in a great neighborhood within walking distance of Whole Foods and restaurants.  It is more than an apartment, it is a way of life in the Park Place community.  I lived in a 2 bedroom second floor apartment for 3 years.  During that time, my experiences with the Park Place team/staff and management were great.  Especially exceptional is Dan Fairbanks, the senior leasing consultant. Dan stands out as a superior member of the team who goes out of his way to solve any problem/issue that may arise as efficiently and quickly as possible.  Whether it be a repair or any issue, he takes a personal interest in it , takes charge instantly and makes sure we are happy tenants, and always with a smile on his face!  He cares about those who live in the apartments and is a great asset to the Park Place community!</text>< pictures>

Daniel has always been cheerful, friendly and helpful. As a senior citizen who has lived here for almost 2 years, I have seen employees come and go and I have met several as I've gone to the office to ask a question or for some help. Whenever I've seen Daniel, he  has consistently greeted me with a warm hello and a big smile and offer to help. Thank you, Daniel, for the great service!< /review>

<Text>Park Place San Mateo Apartment Homes are beautiful!  I moved here in December because I needed more space.  I lived at another Equity community in Fremont prior to my move, which was also great!  The transfer program that Equity offers made my life easier when I needed to find a more convenient location for work travel.  My two bedroom home at Park Place is so amazing!  I just love the open layout and the space!  My Kitchens has new appliances and the apartment was upgraded before I moved in.  I was very satisfied with the condition of the apartment when I moved in!  My family will be coming to visit for my wedding and I can't wait to show off my new home!  My Dogs love the park right next to us and the grounds are very plush and relaxing to walk through. The staff has also been super helpful and friendly!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I had a great experience living at Park Place. The office and maintenance staff are all very friendly and efficient. I appreciated their quick replies to my calls and emails. I also like that I could send packages to the office when they required signatures.
The location is excellent, noise levels in general are low and its conveniently located near restaurants, Whole Foods, and 101/280 highways. The apartment itself was great, I loved having laundry in unit, vaulted ceilings and AC. Its a pet friendly community and has the doggy bag stations all of the walking paths.<//Text>

Just moved in and have to say that Daniel at Park Place really made the hassle of moving as smooth as possible.  He was very honest about pricing and trade-offs of this property vs others in the area.  Also - his level of follow up and follow through was perfect!!  He has great local knowledge and is able to help with the entire move - from finding the right furniture, to utilities, etc....  He really seemed to care that we found the place that was right for us.  The apartment we got was just renovated - basically brand new on the interior, and no surprises yet!!  Super friendly staff!!</Review>

It has been a great experience. The location is great and building maintenance is also great. The staff at the office are friendly and helpful. Any maintenance is carried out quickly. I had a great experience with Daniel Fairbanks. He goes out of the way to help residents even after his office timings. My front door got locked as the previous tenant had put a night latch and it got engaged when I closed the door. Was very responsive and helpful even after I closed the lease. The rent increase tends to be on the higher side.<//Text>

Besides, the staff in the office are the best! We stay here mostly because of our Community Manager, Daniel who is very sensible, helpful always with a solution for every problem. I consider him the best worker here.  Even when we are Hispanic and don't speak English very well he accommodate the vocabulary in order to flowing the communication.
I strongly recommend this complex and go straight to Daniel to accommodate your needs.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1476974488825, 'text': "Hi Rosa!

< Review>
We've been in Park Place for two years and just recently worked with Daniel to renew our lease for a third year. He was great to work with and really went to bat for us to keep our rent lower and within the community. It really is a convenient spot located so close to any major freeway, and the community perks of the small park and pool are major pluses. In a world where so many places aren't flexible or treat you as a number, Daniel went out of his way to keep us at Park Place.< /Review>

We spent 7 wonderful years living at Park Place at San Mateo Apartments.   The time went by very quickly and the location was perfect.  The staff were always friendly and helpful and any issues we raised were resolved quickly. Plenty of things are within walking distance, including the CalTrain station. Overall a very positive experience!<//text>

The apartments are clean and aren't tiny and some of the amenities were great but they leave a lot to be desired. They really nickel and dime you for everything. They brag about all these new things that they have added but none of them are included (such as bike racks and electric car charger spots). Compound that with their rules about not allowing you to keep your bike in your apartment and it just becomes another fee. The maintenance team was not very good either. One or two of them really did a good job but the majority of the others didn't fix things well if at all and didn't communicate what they were doing. They also renovated many of the units recently and the maintenance staff flat out told us they did a bad job doing them. Many cabinets in the kitchen don't open right and we couldn't open the fridge or dishwasher all the way without hitting the cabinets. The elevators in my building were broken more often than they were working and getting stuck in them isn't unusual. I later learned that they are about 20 years old and aren't the right type for the building but management didn't want to replace them till no longer work at all. When we moved out they said that no matter how much cleaning we did or didn't do we were going to be charged for a full cleaning and a complete repaint of the apartment regardless of if it needed it. Overall awful management.<//text>

We are yet to move in but my review is based on our wonderful experience during the leasing process. Our leasing agent, Daniel Fairbanks was super helpful and very personable. He understood our needs and concerns, was patient and helped us find the right match for us without being pushy. The community is beautiful, close to the caltrain station which is important to us and next to a Whole foods and a bunch of restaurants. The apartments overall are good and some units are more upgraded than others. We are looking forward to moving in and hope to have a pleasant time while we are there.< /Review>

Fantastic Location! I have been a resident here for 4 years. Dan has brightened my life and had brought a different culture to the community. I travel a lot of the time for work and having easy access to the freeways is super convient. Whole Foods is just steps away which make my life much easier. I look forward to retirement in the next 15 years and hope I can continue to stay until then.< /Review>

I went there for the rental tour two days ago and had a great experience there, and I ended up submit the application right after the tour. The thing I like most is they have a really nice environment, with several big parks, trees and grasses. People in the leasing office are very nice and helpful as well, makes me feel it'll be a great place to live.<//Text>

Staff way very friendly.  Very impressed with the well landscaped property.  Flowers and trees in blooms and the parks really make this hidden gem a special place.  Shopping, Restaurants, Massage Envy, Day Spa, Dry Cleaners, Dentist, and Kaiser is just right outside the community and conveniently located.  Looking forward to a Summer move as this is our #1 property so far.< /Review>

<review>We have been living in Park Place for just over a month and are really happy to be here.  We had to move quickly and the leasing staff made it happen for us seamlessly and we had a lease in hand the same afternoon.  The staff have been friendly and really prompt in responding to our questions and requests.

The location is fantastic;  it's right next to 101 and 92 and, dangerously close to Whole Foods, Peet's coffee, and Starbucks, to name a few.  It's great being able to walk to these places without having to get in the car, especially when needing to grab an item or two from Whole Foods in a pinch.

We're in building #2 in a second floor unit and have a nice view of the courtyard.  The courtyard is pretty and  surprisingly quiet for being such close quarters.  The apartment itself works really well for us (love having an in-unit washer/dryer!).  We moved from a three-bedroom, two-bath into a two-bedroom, two-bath and were able to fit all of our furniture due to the generous size living space.  (In fact, we ended up at Park Place and were willing to pay a bit more to be here because all the other apartments that we looked at that were in a slightly lower price range had living room/dining room areas that could barely fit one couch and a small bistro table and chairs let alone anything else.)  We do hear footsteps from above (even walking normally) but this hasn't bothered us (and I'm a light sleeper).  We don't hear any noise from our neighbors next to us except for the front doors which  close very quickly and loudly on their own.

An added bonus to living here (in addition to the pool that's now just reopening) is the on-site storage units.  We ended up paying significantly less for a unit that was virtually the same size as an off-site, nearby storage facility.  This has been SO convenient!

Overall, we're really pleased with the place and - for apartment living - I think it's a great choice for this area.<//review><rating>5</rating>< UserId.>

<Review>After many attempts with many apartment options we decided to move forward with Park Place. The Assistant Manager Daniel Fairbanks was very friendly, funny and motivated us to move in, making us feel like we already at home. We love the hardwood floors, the layout and our big patio where we spend a lot of our quality time at. We are so happy that we are here and thanks to the Park Place Team we have been able to our service requests completed in a fast and efficient way. Our two dogs: Daisy and Diesel love their new home and we look forward in making our memories with Park Place. Thanks Daniel for your excellent customer service and your motivation into bringing us home! We love it here, and anyone who moves in will also love it! Before applying and checking the apartments we checked the reviews as many business and properties will know reviews are always given some good and bad , don't go based on reviews always because when it comes to service requests and maintenance it's about follow up and maintain your own place clean! We followed our hearts to check it out and now we are here!<//Review>< pics>

<text>The staff (especially Daniel F.) were a huge help and answered all my questions.  Most properties I've visited (at least 10) in the last few weeks appear to have a stuffy vibe about them, but Park Place is very welcoming and the staff is extremely friendly.

Park Place San Mateo is by far the best place to live. I personally searched 13 other communities that compared in price, space and desired location.  I considered a couple of others until I met Daniel, the Manager at Park Place.

Dan listened to my needs and without writing anything down, he addressed each one with understanding. He answered all my what-ifs, superbly.

As he spoke about this community and the facilities, I could immediately  see that his concern for the residents was second to none. His caring approach and passion for making sure he didn't miss a single detail with respect to ensuring the facility was operating at peak-performance was "aww inspiring". I listened to how he follows up on vendors and maintenance needs and felt that he was truly on his game!

I couldn't have picked a better community thanks to people like Daniel, and all the other people who I had the please of speaking with in the leasing office. So friendly and helpful even when you can see they put in long hours. You wouldn't know it by how well you are treated. They are all here to make sure the resident's time is not worrying about our apartment or the facilities functionality.

Thank you again Daniel and everyone who is part of the Park Place team. I will refer my friends in need of a home to you.

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>I moved in 2 weeks ago and so far my experience has been great. I relocated from New York so I had no idea what to expect with the apartments and the neighborhood. I flew in for the day view apartments so I had limited time to view. Daniel Fairbanks, the leasing agent, made the whole experience wonderful and calming. He could tell I was anxious to get everything wrapped up. He provided me with every detail that I would need to move in right down to the key phone numbers I would need and estimates of the monthly bills so I could provide my company with estimated costs. He gave me information about the area AND the day I moved in even helped me load my huge boxes onto the dolly, so friendly and helpful. I was so impressed with the level of customer service I received from Daniel.  I highly recommend the complex for the convenience of the stores in walking distance, location to SF and other areas of interest close and the friendly office staff.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Although I did not end up renting a place from them (at least not yet), my experience visiting Park Place was fantastic. Daniel, the Leasing Manager, was extremely helpful - as I walked in without an appointment 20 minutes before their scheduled close. He showed me various apartments in an effort to find something that fit what I was looking for. He was friendly, talkative and eager to help. This was such a positive experience hence I needed to say something about it.</review>

<Review>My family and I moved to Park Place apartments a few weeks ago and it has been a great experience.  We have enjoyed it very much so far .  It is located in a great neighborhood within walking distance of Whole Foods and restaurants.  It is more than an apartment, it feels like a way of life in the Park Place community. Between the friendly maintenance and office staff we are so happy we choose this community.  We look forward to the next several years!<//Review>< Pictures>

We have lived at Park Place for three years and just signed a lease for our fourth year. We have loved the well-kept community and great location at Bay Meadows. The maintenance staff are always very prompt and the leasing office staff (especially Dan!) are nice, responsive, and helpful. For families with kids, there are great playgrounds and outdoor areas nearby.<//text>

<text>While looking for a place to call home, I toured Park Place in San Mateo and found the team to be extremely helpful and knowledgable of their apartment complex as well as what other complexes in the area had to offer their residents.  Overall, park place offers far more than other complexes. I called three or four times during the process and their sales team was extremely helpful and accommodating to take the time to answer my questions.  In the long run, If I had to do it again, I would not go anywhere else.< /text>< date>

Five star experience! I've been living at Park Place for 4 months now and I couldn't be happier. Daniel and Ruth are exceptional, professional and always provide service with a smile. Even after being a resident for a few months they always greet me by name and ask if I need anything. They're very respectful of my work hours, including the maintenance team - at times I sleep during the day and they have made arrangements not to disturb me. Also, love the gym!</Text>

< review>
We are new residents and are so happy we made Park Place our home! The property is in a great location, very clean and well maintained, but what truly sold us was the nice leasing staff who made sure we got into the perfect apartment that met all of our needs. We are so excited to be part of such a great community!</review>

<Text>Upon our first visit to Park Place before we had finalized where we would be moving, Daniel Fairbanks (our leasing agent) made us feel like family and Park Place feel like home. His personality, transparency, and energy convinced us that Park Place was the place for us. Needless to say, we LOVE our new apartment and the community that we have joined!< /Text>< userid>

Amazing Environment. Good Public School area and excellent access to any shopping area (Wholefoods Market, Starbucks & Good food restaurant walk distance). Staff at Leasing office is really Nice. Swimming pool and BBQ place is really spacious. Perfect environment to raise children up, we miss this place so much.<//text>

Daniel and Tiffany were amazing - they worked around the clock helping us make an easy decision to stay here. Their work ethic, attitude and helpfulness really helps make this such a great place for us to be with our family. Looking forward to our 5th great year here.< /Review>

I toured nearly every high end apartment complex in the area from San Mateo to San Bruno. This included Field House, Metropolitan, 888 San Mateo, 55 W Fifth, Avalon San Bruno, Acapella, and of course Park Place. My goal was to be far enough from the city to have good weather but not too far for my commute. Park Place was the perfect fit, it had literally everything I was looking for. Prime location (4 min bike ride, all residential roads), every amenity you can think of, top notch leasing office, responsive property management, etc. I moved in only 2 weeks ago but I've been so happy with my experience so far that I had to share it. Dan was my leasing agent, he made the whole process a piece of cake. He's a super friendly, low pressure kind of guy, which is exactly the kind of person that I (and probably all people) like to deal with. I'm so glad I made the right call on this place.<//Text>

Dan is very good at what he does and is very knowledgable. Dan is easy to talk too and willing to go the extra mile to take care of you and your needs. I am pleased with the information that Dan provided me on tour yesterday and look forward to working with him in the future.
Excellent experience

We have been at Park Place San Mateo for about 4 months and we have really enjoyed our stay here. I was initially worried about noise as our apartment faces a walkway by the elevator but the complex is quiet at nights and this has never been a problem. Daniel and the rest of the front office staff are fantastic. They have made moving in and living here a breeze.< /text>

I usually don't write reviews but I really needed to voice how pleased I am with the new management staff at Park Place. We were seriously considering moving after dealing with the old regime but Daniel F. changed all of that. He is completely committed to making residents happy and comfortable in their homes. After a series of unfortunate events, Dan personally made sure that everything was back to the way it should be...He kept us informed and followed through with what needed to be done. He heard our concerns and acted quickly and professionally.  WE LOVE DAN! I can now say that we are happy at Park Place. Thank you Dan!<//review>

Sophia and Jeff in the leasing office are super responsive and friendly. The other leasing office staff we've interacted with have also been great, but we have dealt mostly with Jeff and Sophia. Jeff and Sophia both know our dog by name, and they always have treats for him when we visit the office. Also, it's nice that there are so many other friendly dog owners. I can walk to the Whole Foods in under five minutes, and I end up getting last minute groceries from there several times a week. The price is comparable to every other apartment complex we toured in the area, but it seems like you get a lot more for your money here. The covered and private parking is super sweet, and we like that our delivered packages are stored in a secure area.< /Review>< Pictures>

I just moved into Park Place at San Mateo. The apartment is in fantastic condition and everything is renovated or cleaned before moving in. There were some issue with my furniture move-in, but Dan kindly helped me out through the entire process and I can't ask for more! I recommend this place to everyone who is considering an apartment in San Mateo Area.

P.S. there is a Whole foods, a dry cleaner, multiple dining locations and coffee shops right across the street from Park Place. Every convenient!< /text>

Moving into Park Place has been one of the smoothest and most pleasant experiences I've had.  After reading so many negative reviews, my positive experience makes me wonder if Equity Residential management has changed or possibly even stepped up to better standards from the time of these previous postings?

The highlights of this 4 star review include:

- Murray Frost, our Leasing agent, has been professional, engaging, responsive from start to finish.  He has been an advocate for the renter, looking out for the best available apartment for me based on my search criteria. He e-mailed me with availability as they came up even after I had put down the initial deposit, in the event a more recent apartment appealed more to me. Since we've moved in, he's been so responsive, helpful, and available to all our moving-in needs.  He was one of the key reasons we felt so happy with our decision to move here.

- The newly renovated apartments. The new renovations make a big difference to the apartment.  The kitchen and bathroom are fully new with modern appliances, tiling, counter tops, cabinetry.  They make for a great look and feel.  Our carpeting was also new, as was the flooring at the entrance and kitchen.

- You can't beat the peace & quiet neighborhood feel.  The apartment complex has a community feel, even despite all the construction going on around Bay Meadows.  The demographics of young couples and young families is great, and gives the place a mature and friendly feel.  The proximity to downtown San Mateo, Foster City, are all less than 10 minutes away, and the ease of getting onto 101 is convenient.  You can have your "city" and "suburb" all within a stones throw.

- The My Equity Apartments website is handy to manage your rent payments, maintenance requests, package deliveries.

Why I didn't give 5 stars:

- Where there could be improvement is the storage space within the apartments.  The studio sizes actually aren't the smallest I've seen, they could obviously be bigger.  Considering how much area space there is for the kitchen, dining, and living room area, the actual cabinet and closet space is very limited.  The bedroom closets are small for 2 people, probably okay for 1 person.  The cabinets in the bathroom and kitchen are plenty but they are shallow.

- Notification of pool renovation and unavailability through year-end.  Being new, we don't yet know how often maintenance occurs but this is an amenity that we will just need to wait for!<//text>

We came across Park Place last weekend when we stopped by the Habit Burger for lunch and decided to take a look at the community.  We were greeted by a man named Dan who was very happy to immediately start a conversation with myself and my husband.  We will be relocating from Colorado in May and were happy to find this hidden gem.  The apartments have been refurbished and off all upgraded stainless appliances.  Conveniently located to all major freeways, shopping, restaurants, and the Caltrain.  He also mentioned the beach was right over the hill. AWESOME! Dan did a great job identifying our needs and answering questions before he was even asked.  We had never encountered such a happy leasing agent before that loved what he did so much.  We look forward to staying in touch with Dan to see what becomes available as we get closer to our move.<//Text>

I have lived here for six months now and have found the grounds well maintained, the buildings impeccable and the staff very friendly and attentive.

This was a very difficult cross-country move and the team made the entire process very easy.

I have a beautiful two bedroom apartment - which I was also worried about, as I am a light sleeper.  The very well constructed apartments are not altogether sound proof but are very very well insulated and I only hear my above neighbor practicing the piano.

Park Place is a wonderful location, central to everything, a quick trip to SFO but without any airplane noise.  So glad I chose Park Place!<//review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>This is a comfortable, attractive apartment village next to some convenient shopping, across from a police station, and with quick highway access. The initial quality of the units is very high when moving into a freshly renovated unit.  The neighbors are generally quiet and polite to each other.   There have been other minor issues that come with wear (like the occasional elevator problem or gate call box malfunction) but that's true of every apartment building I've ever seen. Once reported, they're generally fixed in a reasonable time frame.

The real attraction to this unit comes from the on-site staff. They're simply stellar. Problems with the unit? Fixed fast. Package theft reported? Addressed and even busted a suspect on that one. Pet mess on property? Addressed fast and rules enforced. They're kind and take an active interest in the residents' happiness and comfort.

So why not five stars instead of four? It's owned by a huge national chain whose practice is to attract new residents at much lower rates than renewals. My first renewal offer was roughly a $500/mo increase for a one-bedroom, one-bath apartment. That was a year ago. We worked together and found a slightly lower middle ground but still an obnoxiously high raise for a single year renewal. My second renewal offer this year wasn't as bad, but it did not properly reflect the area's cooling off of the rental market and still felt high. Again, the local apartment staff worked with the corporate office and got me a more reasonable rate that was still more than I hoped, but easier to meet.

Since most apartments are owned by conglomerates these days, this practice is expected. I can still deduct a star from the rating, though. I'd rent at Equity again before I set foot into an Avalon owned unit, I can tell you.

Thanks Dan, Megan,  and everyone who works hard to make this place a home.</Review>< userid>

<date>1516933455748<//date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Been a resident here for the past 2 years.  My wife and I initially moved into a 1 bedroom that more than fit our needs.  Now that I work from home, we have decided to move to a 2 bedroom. We discussed the idea of looking into another complex, but ultimately decided Park Place had everything to offer, and didn't want to leave. As other posts have mentioned, the location is tough to beat. The apartments themselves are modern, with new appliances, fireplace, marble or granite counter tops, carpeting in living areas and hardwood floors in the kitchen/dining area. There is plenty of storage space as well as balconies and in apartment washer and dryers.

But the things that stand out here are the staff. Starting with the leasing office. Megan and her team were super helpful making this transition to the 2 bedroom happen.  Despite the fact that we aren't new residents, they still took the time to take care of showing and discussing with us all of our options.  They answered all of our questions and worked with us to make the process as painless as possible. Both Jeff and Sophia were extremely patient showing us the unit's multiple times and even staying late one night to show my wife after she got home from work.

It would be a huge miss not to mention the maintenance crew headed up by Edy. From day one since we moved in they have been super responsive to any service call I've submitted. Most recently, our hot water heater had issues. They made the repair twice. After a 3rd frustrating time of putting in a repair request, they didn't even ask me. They showed up the next day with a brand new hot water heater. Because of the inconvenience of not having hot water, Edy got us a key for another vacant apartment on the floor below. This was so we could shower and anything else we needed while the repairs were taking place. Throughout this process the entire team was extremely considerate and diligent getting the job done. Hats off to Edy, Scott, Octavio, Johnathan and Ronnel who helped out with this service call.

Glad we have decided to stay at Park Place for at least another year.  We are both very happy with the apartment, the location, and the staff. We are proud to have both family and friends come visit/stay with us here.< /Review>< pics>

From our tour with Dan to getting approved at Park Place was overall a great experience. The staff has been very helpful with everything to make our move-in as easy as possible.

Our apartment was clean and in working condition as expected. I haven’t taken full advantage of all the amenities but I’m looking forward to going to the gym and entertainment area with the full sized pool table.

The location is perfect with everything in walking distance... crunch gym, Whole Foods, Starbucks, Shiki Japanese, and the Ponzu Poke Bar are amongst my favorites.< /Text>

When service meet class, Welcome to Park Place at San Mateo. I've been a resident here for almost 2 years and wouldn't change it. The staff is amazing and they're always looking to improve the amenities and provide residents with A+ service. I'd highly encourage potential renters to stop by and ultimately make the community your home. Can't beat having Whole Foods, Starbucks, and Peet's in walking distance!< /Review>

< Review>
We stayed at Park Place for two years and found it to be a fantastic residence and living experience. We had the pleasure of working with wonderful members of the Park Place Team. Dan Fairbanks for example, was always absolutely wonderful, on many occasions. Other staff, past and present, have been very nice and helpful. The maintenance team has provided thoughtful and timely service, on occasion going out of their way without our having to plead or cajole.

The pool area is fantastic, and now after renovations, is even more so. I will miss the gym, it was super convenient and open 24 hours. I used it for cardio purposes and did not make use of the second gym with weights. It was nice to have the two separate rooms. I have also made use of the office accommodations in the lounge and love the electronic package receiving room.

There is community life at Park Place. Special, not infrequent events, that the staff put together, such as safe eclipse viewing, painting parties, mixers and all sorts of things. It's an excellent place to live and let me walk easily to the Caltrain to commute to my job.

Our moving out had two objectives: school district and saving a little money. The staff was extremely helpful in that regard, as well, beyond simply steering us toward other Equity Apartments. Having fully completed the move out process, I can say we were treated very well there, too, and in Park Place style, they went above and beyond to accommodate us with some special circumstances when we had an overseas death in the family and had to scramble out before having everything in good order. I wasn't even in the country on my final move out day.

In short I will miss Park Place very much and do not hesitate recommending it to anyone looking for a nice, luxury apartment experience. Thank you Park Place!</Review>

<Text>While the property is conveniently located, I would strongly recommend against moving into this community. While the staff is friendly, and the 30 day move-out guarantee is a nice safety net, these apartments are disgracefully over-priced as "luxury" apartments.

First off, this complex is noisy. The walls are paper-thin, and you can clearly hear conversations going on in adjacent units at normal volumes. The washing machines from nearby units (even across the hall) are audible constantly.

Second, these aren't "luxury" apartments on the inside. While some of the units have "upgrades," the others have cheap appliances in the kitchens, cheap linoleum in the kitchen/bath, and single-paned windows that don't offer any noise reduction/privacy.

The worst thing about this community is the shared ventillation that allows cigarette smoke from an adjacent unit to enter yours. We moved out of the San Mateo Archstone 10 days after moving in - in part because of the noise, but mostly because a downstairs neighbor sent a constant stream of smoke into our apartment.

Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this community. The "convenience" just isn't worth it. You won't have to look hard to find a newer property that's more modern, smoke-free, and basically the same price.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Park Place has been my home for the past year. The entire staff are all friendly and helpful. The stores are conveniently located and walking distance which makes living here ideal. One person that stands out is leasing agent, Daniel Fairbanks. He has been incredibly helpful and has made my move from a one bedroom to a three-bedroom a breeze! He is professional, compassionate and truly gets the job done. The best part is his "follow-up" --he checks back with you to make certain that everything went as planned. I can't say enough good things about Dan, but I am sure you will find out that you can add to my list!<//Review>

Poor place to live, my windows have not been cleaned on the outside for over a year, everything inside and outside is falling apart. Management ignores to fix things, even reached out to a regional manager, no one responds to my calls or emails...will be filing a complaint to the city of San Mateo as I have enough evidence to at least have someone reach back to me...

Other things, break in are common here, loud neighbors as the walls are paper thin, grass lawn is always flooded with water, they have sprinklers working when it’s pouring rain, a lot of dust and dirt from the freeway... air is very toxic. And the rent they are asking, let’s just say I can rent a nice house in Beverly Hills for a 2 bedroom...

If anyone from upper management reads this please contact me<//text>

<review>Park Place has been our home for about 8 years. We enjoyed our stay there due to the convenience of work, school, and the shops in the area. When Park Place was under Archstone, they had the best apartment amenities such as a heated pool w/bbq access, a beautiful clubhouse with a theatre downstairs. Management was awesome. When Equity took over, they changed everything from diminishing our enjoyable amenities to the same service we received from the previous management.
I've had my fair share of bad experiences with the change of hands and different associates at the leasing office. But when I met Daniel, he was a breath of fresh air. He was very attentive and have been able to answer my questions regarding moving out and has been very helpful from the noise complaints to the incorrect information received from a few of the associates regarding my new rate change. He followed up with me when I was charged for not painting the baseboards. I don't agree with the move out charges at this place as they are renovating it anyway plus considering the time I've spent living here.
Overall, I can say that Daniel have been the only one in the leasing office that have gone above and beyond to help me with my questions and concerns. I would only recommend this place because of the service I received from Daniel.< /review><Response>None< /Response><Date>1459816188615</Date><userid>107342030082339215205</userid></record></dataset><record>

<review>The leasing office was extremely helpful.  I thought I had my mind made up in another apartment and had a change of heart after visiting this one.  The grounds are nice and peaceful, but there are still people out and about.  It's conveniently located near a Whole Foods and a few restaurants and coffee shops.  The mall is close by either by car or a 30 minute walk.  The common areas (conference room, media room, and gym) are open 24/7 and have access to wifi.  The apartments are being renovated, so even though the building is older, it doesn't seem like it.  Let the leasing office know what you want, and they'll do their best to match you up with what they have available.<//review>< Rate>

<Text>Great staff. Very friendly and easy to lease from. Units are relatively new with reasonable prices.

Ended up leasing from them about a month ago and have been happy with the ease of interacting with staff for maintenance concerns. In the month they've hosted a paint + wine night which was fun to do as well as to meet other people in the neighborhood.

The area is very quiet with easy access to the 101 and 92. A few shops nearby (japanese, chipotle, burgers, hair salon) along with a whole foods all in walking distance. Easy to get to Foster city for a run/bike ride along the bay trail although a couple hairy sections crossing the on ramps.< /Text>< pics>

Excellent area to live with great access to food (fast food and restaurants), access to 101 and 10 mins from SFO. The apartments are refurbished and look very nice! There is a pool with hot tub and underground parking in what is a very very safe area of town. Also, San Mateo downtown is very close by which has some excellent food and drink.

The management have recently made changes in personnel and Ruth and Dan are both excellent. You will be in very capable hands with both of those lovely folks.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>My wife and I recently relocated from SoCal, and Dan was A-MAZING in helping us find our place sight unseen!  He went above and beyond by taking additional photos for us, and to even take personal measurements to help us figure out how much space we had to work with.  Even though we are going from a 2-bedroom to a 1-bedroom...it still feels spacious with the high ceilings.  The leasing staff as a whole seems very nice, and the property is pet friendly which is a huge plus!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Same old predatory management company as out east where we were living prior with equity. Rent is high, fees everywhere for everything no other management company charges for, and at then of every 12 month lease they try to get an extra 10% in rent out of you. Take no responsibility for shoddy construction and appliances in apartment. Took us a dozen service requests to get apt into shape it should have been in when we moved in. Should have replaced stained carpet before we moved in but instead pocketed the money and said they wouldn’t charge us for steam cleaning on the way out. Gee, thanks.

Also they take no responsibility for issues. Cherry on the cake was dog below us barking all day and neighbors above us clomping around at all hours. Never had any issues with noise like this with neighbors in 10 years of apt living in nyc.

Also, they beg you to write favorable yelp and google reviews a week  after moving in because all employees on the property have a boss (a level above the property gm) they are deathly scared of despite the fact that they don’t want to do the work and take the responsibility worthy of a 5 star review. Zero financial remediation when they f - up. I think they lose track of the fact I’m paying them $5Ok a year in rent - I’ve had customer service at restaurants to car dealerships willing to work much harder and do backflips to keep me happy - these guys don’t care.

Really focused on acquiring new residents and charging them through the teeth with random fees but no interest in retaining clients or garnering loyalty - zero business sense. Don’t waste your time.

Only reason it’s not a one star review is property is beautiful and on site staff is really nice and attentive.<//Review>< Pics>

Park Place is conveniently located near 101 and Hillsdale station, and there's Whole Foods, a daycare, and several eating joints at walking distance. Zach was very responsive to all our questions during our initial apartment search. We ran into a little hiccup when the apartment we originally shortlisted did not get vacated, but Megan was super helpful in finding us another apartment very quickly and accommodating all our requests. Dan gave us a warm welcome tour on the day of the move. It's been a month since then, and we absolutely love living here and watching our son play at the two big parks inside the community.< /review>

I visited Park Place last Sunday and must say I am impressed in what I have seen so far.  Conveniently located near restaurants and coffee shops - Starbuck's,  Pete's Coffee, & Chipotle just to name a few.  The units are updated with new kitchen, bathroom fixtures and appliances.  The staff has been very helpful and friendly.  I am definitely considering Park Place.< /Text>

I have been unable to sleep since I moved in due to the noise from the neighbors upstairs and property management have done nothing about this.  The police have told me it is property management that needs to deal with this.  Will look into filing a suit with these people.<//Review>

The staff is great, but our move-in experience was not what I had hoped.  We had made an appointment to pick up our keys and the apartment was  not ready.  Maintenance was still being done on the place and it wasn't cleaned very well.  Spots were dusty and the hardwood floors were dirty.  But again, the staff quickly fixed stuff I brought to their attention.  Other than having to spiff up the place, so far so good.  Great location!  I can get my exercise in when I walk to the Caltrain less than a mile away.  Quite convenient with a dry cleaner, hair salon, Whole Foods, Kindercare and a few places to eat a few yards away. 3 stars for initial move-in, plus one more star for location.<//Text>

My girlfriend and I moved across the country at the beginning of 2017 and are very happy we chose Park Place.  Dan and the staff helped us out with really anything we needed and were always responsive with any issues.

This location is awesome - you can walk to Whole Foods, Crunch Fitness, Chiptole, Sushi, Peet's coffee....

Nice parks for kids and dogs. Caltrain a mile away. Pool and hot tub with a brand new BBQ area!

Quiet and comfortable part of town. 👌🏼< /Text>

<text>This is a first impressions review on Park Place at San Mateo. My husband and I are moving from Chicago IL to San Mateo CA next month.  We toured the facility with one of the leasing agents, Zach on Saturday 9/17/16.  Zach was very friendly, knowledgeable and personable.  Although he is very new to the area himself, he answered any and all questions we had about the surrounding area.  Any questions (about local stores, grocery shopping and farmers markets) he didn't know the answer too, he kindly looked up for us.  We were able to get a very good feel for the area with his help.
As for the Facility, it was very well kept, very clean, well light, and felt very secure (having 2 small children, this is something we appreciate).  The gym was nice, the pool/lounge area was great, they're building a outdoor grill area soon, the park area was nice (great for tiny humans to expend energy in), there are party/event rooms you can rent or just hang out in, the location of the building is in a very nice area close to a police department, everything about this place felt right.
We came in looking for a 2 bed/2 bath unit.  We toured 3 layouts with Zach, one on the top floor that gets LOTS of sunlight and had light brown counter tops, One on the first floor that had hardwood and a larger porch, and one on the 2nd floor that had black granite counter tops.  At the end, we sat down with Zach and he found us the 1 available unit that had everything we liked from the tour (we decided we wanted 2nd floor, with the darker counter tops, a lease that started on October 14th, and the 2 bed layout where the rooms were across from each other rather than right next to each other).  He made the process very easy for us and we are very excited to join the community!< /text>< Pics>

If you're the type of person who enjoys having restaurants, parks, gyms, grocery stores, a daycare, year-long pool, even a dentist and doctors office all within walking distance of where you live, then this place is for you.

PROS:
-The amenities here at Park Place are kept in fantastic condition, and my family especially loves taking our young son to play on the playground(s).
We are looking forward to the upcoming BBQ area being put in the renovated year-round heated pool.

-The on-site workout center has a healthy amount of updated equipment to use, and the media-room is perfect for getting friends and family together for a fun night at the movies without the cost of the movie theater.

-The underground parking keeps your cars out of the elements, and elevators make it convenient to get your family/groceries/etc. to and from your vehicle.

-As far as maintenance is considered, they are fast at getting to your tickets, and if there are any foreseen delays, they are quick to let you know up front and explain why it'll take longer. (For example, unusually heavy rain this winter led to some green algae on the patio - I spoke with the front office and they gladly put in a ticket to get the patio pressure washed. They were upfront about the time and said it may not happen within the next two days due to several maintenance people being out with an illness. I really appreciate their setting an honest expectation instead of the standby "we'll get to it eventually" that I've seen in other apartments.)

-The front office staff are fantastic to work with, very knowledgeable about the local area and ready to assist with any request.

CONS:
-The price. Let's face it, that's the bay area for you. If you're looking at the price as just covering the apartment, then yes, it's high. However, you are getting so much more here - this is a community with convenience built right into its fabric. You're paying for access to two phenomenal parks (very large parks at that), local shopping,  close access to the highway, and a beautiful community that is also kept safe with a police department being pretty much across the street.

-As random as it is, the only other big complaint I have concerns two components of how the kitchen in our two-bed/bath is laid out.
~The dishwasher is in the corner, so you can't actually reach the shelves when you're unloading the dishes.
~There isn't much storage in the kitchen itself, so I've had to add my own.

Altogether, we've been very pleased with our stay here, and are even considering going to a 3-bed variant (assuming the right price can be reached).</review>

<Date>1521094336199<//Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Great environment, courteous neighbors, and friendly staff. What more can you ask for... was what I posted 2 years back.
Now I've left the community and the incompetence of the staff still haunts me.
1. Lift in block 5 is always down, safely say that more than a third of the year, expect to climb stairs.
2. Without prior notice they slap you with a late payment fee of 5% or over $150 since rent is through the roof. It's not that I did not pay, but had setup autopayment through the portal but for some reason bank held it up. If this happens to you, don't bother appealing. Staff will tell you that they are not able to do anything.
3. The last straw that made me draft this bad review.
After moving out, they were meticulous to do the checks and deduct away all of the deposit, which I'm used to, renting from these big REIT managed residences, but even after taking away the deposit, it left a $10 charge.
Yes, you get a robo-call everyday reminding you that there is a charge. Fair enough. I paid promptly through bank transfer, seeing the payment go through, I had not given it much thought, besides, the robo-call stopped coming. Only found out that there was still a balance when I saw a negative credit alert that my credit score dipped over 50 points. PARK PLACE REPORTED A DELINQUENT ACCOUNT TO THE CREDIT AGENCIES. Without the heart to give me a call even though they had my number, nor an email to mention what was going on! Throughout the 2 years living there, the staff had been friendly and approachable. I'm wondering if they are just understaffed, or the "community" is just squeezed to make the profits the management companies need to satisfy their investors.

Dear Equity residential, I hope you can treat residents in your community like humans instead of cash-cows with your 5-10% rent hikes and bloated 10q, while maintaining understaffed communities, patch-up facilities, and heartless management.<//Review>< Pics>

<name>Billy Smith</name><time>1452751543226<//time><Rating>2</Rating><review>Here is the truth from a resident that has lived in Park Place, not one incentivised to post a review prior to even living here.  I wonder what the incentive was, must have been good.

Pros:
1. Maintenance staff are quick to resolve issues and are very nice.
2. Management tries to keep up with upgrades, including a new rec. area and repaired hallway balconies.
3. The grounds are well landscaped.
4. Unit floor plan works well.
5. Tons of street parking, so don't pay $100/month on an extra parking spot.

Cons:
1. Rent increases have ranged from 10-20% a year, based on people we spoke to and have moved out as a result.

2. Some amenities are not accessible except during business hours or by paying a fee.  I am not sure who is around to use them, since we all work, especially to pay the crazy rent.

3. Garbage fees are oddly divided by total amount of units, versus number of bedrooms or number of people.  This means a one bedroom apartment with two people pays the same amount ($44.43/month) as a three bedroom with five people.  You do the math, this equals rip off.

4. Ever wanted to pay $59.40/year just to see your utility bill?  Here is your chance!  That's right, you have to pay $4.95/month for your utility bill, since they use a ridiculous bill management company and would never think to absorb that cost using the $3.62/sq ft/month we pay in rent.

5.  A projected six months without a pool or hot tub, let alone the BBQ seems like a long time to not have a key amenity without compensating the residents.  Other complexes in the area that have sustained construction projects have compensated their residents.  As a result of the construction the grass behind the pool area has been torn up since October. So maybe the previous reviews were based on imagining a nice green lawn.

6. Corporate housing seems like no big deal, until you see dozens of lock boxes outside with keys to random units.  This transient issue leads to some security problems.  Speaking of which, I am not sure what the point of the exterior gates are since they are not for security. They are often propped open, or you can reach over the visiter gate and just open the door from the inside handle or just hop over it all together. I learned this trick from a delivery person.

Park Place Apts in San Mateo is superior in terms of proximity to excellent amenities like Whole Foods, Chipotle, Starbucks, Peets, Hillsdale Mall and only 25 minutes from San Francisco.

The staff is extremely responsive and maintenance requests are almost always completed the same day they are submitted.

I enjoyed living there for 2 years.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Any apartments in the bay area could not be worse than this place.

I lived this place about 6 months. I experience the worst ever management there. Office staffs are very irresponsible and have lack of knowledge, as so many people already pointed out (see the reviews on yelp and apartment rating site). I had to visit the office at least 5 times or email them million times to solve the simple issue.

I am sure many people who are looking for a new place will be attracted to this complex due to the nice location, but I guarantee that you will get a headache everyday from the moment you move in.

You may need to leave with bugs cuz their pest control is horrible, or You may need to park your car at someone else's spot since the staffs randomly switch  the parking spot without a notice.

Also, this place is NOT SAFE. The entire parking lot got broken into this year.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1443820444416, 'text': 'Hello,\nWe are very sorry to hear about these negative experiences.

I've been a resident for almost 3 years  and I have seen alot of positive changes take place over time at Park Place Apartments. The new Assistant Manager, Daniel Fairbanks, has been wonderful.  He has a great demeanor and always displays a very positive and  pleasant attitude.  He  is a very customer service oriented professional who is genuinely concerned about the happiness and satisfaction of the tenants.  I haven't seen this skill level from Management in a very long time.

On several occasions he has gone above and beyond his call of duty to assist me  with an ongoing situation that was quickly resolved. Since his presence at Park Place Apartments, I have seen improvements in communication with the office staff.

The staff is also very friendly and very responsive with service requests.  They strive to keep the complex clean and well maintained,  and always have a proactive attitude towards pre-storm preparation for the tenants.  The addition of the mailroom for delivery of packages was a great idea.

I really enjoy living in this community, and feel very safe and content. The surrounding area has alot of restaurants, Whole Foods, cleaners, Kaiser, Starbucks, Peet"s, Blossom salon and spa and many other great businesses in walking distance.

The amenities offered  are awesome and are above average  compared to any apartment complex in this city and county. It is also the only apartment complex countywide that offers their swimming pool and jacuzzi open year round!  This is a great place to live!!<//Text>

My experience at Parkplace Management   have been a positive experience with Dan and Megan in regards to any questions, concerns or request.

I have gone in for a request for a an issue  and Dan immediately addressed my concern with a positive attitude. He made my experience more pleasurable and convenient. Dan is a people person and truly cares about all the residents at Parkplace. Parkplace is Lucky to have him part of the Parkplace team!

Megan (Manager) is a pleasant person and is always available for any concerns and great in communicating to you immedially with any concerns , questions or request . I am always able to reach Megan thru email and a response is immediately addressed. Megan's  is very responsive and positive about everything she does!

I can't say nothing but great things about Dan and Megan.

Great job!</text>

< Review>
I lived in the complex and community for about 5 years - would have been 5 this June. We came here as newly wed young couple, had a daughter and grew as a family. You cannot beat this location - no matter what - Whole Foods, Chipotle, Peet's & many more things knit into community, no way anything comes closer.

While scouting we looked at plaza - again location bought us back here. We looked at Woodside apartments back then - again location wasn't a match.

Apartments are upgraded to granite counter tops, stainless steel kenmore appliances. There's elevators which is definitely a must; controlled access - definitely needed and keeps us safe. Right next to a great park - actually 2 great parks - one of them happens to be extremely good for young kids and dogs.

Staff is courteous and friendly, we never had any issues, there's 24 hour Gym which is very very well maintained and nice. There's a lounge area with kitchenette that's common for everybody. 24 hour package pickup service - if you miss a package - we'll you didn't.

There's security on ground and maintanence is always available. I mean what more can one family ask for? We had a lot of fun - my daughter knows only park place as home; had we not bought our own we would have rented in park place for another 5.< /Review>

Park Place in San Mateo has been our home for the past two years. Its proximity to The Nueva School in Bay Meadows and pet policy allowing us to keep our family dogs in residence were the initial motivators. Now it is the excellent property management, family-friendly international culture, well thought through apartment layout, lovely exterior landscape, positive community police (SMPD) presence, neighbors who are both friendly and respectful of one another’s privacy, transportation convenience, and amenities that continue to make this a very attractive and desirable place for our family to live.

Previous reviews describe the place and amenities, and you would want to come and see it for yourself. I want to commend property management personnel who are responsive to residents’ needs while keeping the site clean, well maintained, and constantly improving. Amanda leads the property and runs a steady ship. You may not always get a yes (it’s a big corporation; there are rules) but you are guaranteed a fair hearing. Amanda’s responsible presence keeps the trains running on time while her outgoing professionalism sets the tone for the culture of the community. The two members of Amanda’s leasing staff with whom we have worked, Brendan and Daniel, are exactly who you would hope for in leasing executives: effective development representatives who advocate for their prospective and continuing residents. Brendan was promoted and has left to run another property. Daniel F. has stepped in as Senior Leasing Consultant. Ask for him. His responsiveness, personal commitment and knowledge will help your sort your options, get settled and remain a happy resident. Abbie is the friendly, unflappable front office manager with an ever diplomatic, kind and helpful attitude. Mail, keys, complements, concerns, amenity reservations, parking, etc., she is pretty much the perfect residents’ services manager. Maintenance and operations staff are, with one exception, incredibly responsive and polite - always willing to go above and beyond. Service requests are answered promptly. Benny and Scott are the maintenance techs you dream of. They always get the job done with dignity and kindness. If I could name two people who would make me never want to leave Park Place, it’s them. These are the real human beings who transform an attractive corporate development into a desirable place to call home.</Text>

<Review>My fiancee and I started living here three months as a result of his corporate housing and we grew to really love the neighborhood. The convenience of having a Whole Foods, Chipotle, Peet's and Starbucks as well as the Habit Grill are all at your fingertips. The location is about a 14 mins walk to the Caltrain Hillsdale station if you need to travel along the bay. There are also several bus options that are less than 10 mins away to take you into the city.

When it came time to sign our own lease, Megan's team at the leasing office are extremely helpful. Tiffany gave me tours, Daniel helped with questions on parking and Megan was able to provide help with our leasing questions and we ended up getting a really great deal for our one bedroom. The team is accommodating and you can see that they really want to work with you and welcome you to their community.

Even though my commute to SF through Caltrain and Bart/Muni takes me over an hour for work, I really love this neighborhood. My fiancee and I really enjoy the safety and quietness of Park Place. The parks are a real treat, neighbors are pleasant, property is well maintained and the stores/eateries nearby really make it extremely convenient.<//Review>< pictures>

Very convenient location. Wholefoods is right across the street. Hillsdale shopping mall is only couple of minutes drive, also Barnes and Noble, Trader Joes all are very adjacent. If your office is in SF you can take the Caltrain Its only 10 mins walk. Park Place leasing office folks are very helpful and very professional. If you are not happy with the apartment you rent, in 30 days, you can change it with another one. Park Place is the only place who offers this opportunity.<//Review>

<review>Compared to other equity properties this place is a joke. There's a lot of  maintenance and construction noise. Walls seem very thin. Rent increases every lease renewal by a significant percentage. (10-20% I believe) Often year leases are not available meaning your rent ER's upped every 8 months. Billed as luxury apartments. Not in my opinion. The floors are linoleum and the build quality is shoddy. They have updated some units, though I wouldn't call them luxury and they continue to do so which leads to more noise.

The cleaners / staff dig through the trash and take personal items home from the dumpster. That's rude and unprofessional.

The communication between staff members seems to be lacking, and ther has been a significant staff turn over. I waited over a year for a a non-compact space for my SUV and never got one.

There's also a number of sublet corporate housing apartments.

Yes it's close to Whole Foods and coffee shops but that means a lot of traffic around the area. Personally would recommend against.< /review>< pics>

<text>We have lived in this community for more than two years and it has been a very positive and pleasant experience. The pool was recently renovated as well as the gym and community spaces. The community is very family and animal friendly and makes for a total experience in urban living in a park-like setting. We love the convenience of Caltrain and bus transportation nearby to travel in either direction to Palo Alto, San Jose, SFO Airport and San Francisco. This is an excellent environment for walking to many convenient food outlets at the Whole Foods and nearby restaurants as well as Hillsdale Mall. Tha staff and crews have been very pleasant and accomodating throughout our stay. Daniel Fairbanks was particularly knowledgable and user friendly.<//text>< username>

<name>Hayley Johnson</name><review>My husband and I just renewed for another year here!

In 2016, we returned to Park Place at San Mateo after a year of living in another nearby Equity property. Transferring out for a year helped us save some money, but we really missed the features of the apartment itself, as well as the community's proximity to things we like.

We originally moved to San Mateo from downtown Los Angeles in 2014, for new job opportunities. That said, we toured just about every Equity property in the Bay Area, as we were transferring mid-lease from LA and that option was a big help to us. Park Place is definitely the nicest Equity apartment complex that I've toured in the Bay Area, and has that resort-style feel that many complexes in Los Angeles have.

THE APARTMENT
-We live in a 2nd floor 1 Bedroom / 1 Bath, 713 sq. feet with an exterior (not courtyard) view.
-We love the upgraded appliances, in-unit washer and dryer, garden tub, walk-in closet, ceiling fans and thermostat-controlled A/C and heating.
-The apartment complex we moved from did not have a thermostat-controlled A/C or heating. We had many people in the Bay Area tell us you don't need it - but trust us, WE do - we were miserable all summer and winter (basically the entire time we lived there).
-Since we lived here at Park Place before, we knew what to expect in terms of floorplan and storage space. Yes, there is limited kitchen cabinet space. However, there are two linen closets, two shelves above the washer/dryer and we have an Ikea shelf with drawers that we use to store kitchen things in.
-We were in a 1st floor exterior-facing apartment last time and thought we would miss the "walk up" patio entrance that those have - but so far not at all. We prefer the privacy of the 2nd floor.

THE COMMUNITY
-Living within steps of Whole Foods and Bay Meadows park are huge bonuses for us. We love this area and are so glad to be back.
-We live near the day care center and at first were worried that it would be too loud. However, it's been barely audible so far and not a problem at all.
-We must be lucky because we rarely hear our neighbors upstairs or to either side of us. Yes, the front doors slam quickly but we don't notice it all that much. All the years we lived in LA must have de-sentitized us in terms of noise!
-We appreciate the ample guest parking all the way around the community. Very helpful when we have people visit.

THE STAFF
-Dan especially, was an incredible help to us when it came to making the transfer. He was very knowledgeable about the community and Equity's polices, and helped the transition go seamlessly.
-When the accounting department made an error and charged us for days that we weren't living at our old place, Dan immediately took care of it, emailed us an updated statement and let us know when we could expect our refund check in the mail.
-We haven't had any major issues with the apartment or complex itself. The maintenance staff did come to fix a minor cabinet issue quickly after we moved in. I know from living here before that the maintenance team always does a great job and responds to issues promptly.

Glad to be spending another year here!<//review><Time>1491925789941<//Time>< rate>

Disclaimer - this review is solely based upon the move in process not the overall living experience. It is lengthy but only because I'm providing lots of detail. I am a real resident with a lease ending in Jan 2017. I have posted this to several review sites. I  was asked to write a review almost immediately after signing lease, normally I'm a bit skeptical about doing so especially since I've only moved in 2 days ago. Yet my experience was so amazing, the staff and team deserve a review. Here is why:

I moved to the area for a new job from Las Vegas, NV. I checked out a few places and thought I had one picked than by random car exploring I found this complex. Immediately I wanted to check out the rates because the location is spot on for what I was looking for (roughly 1 mile from CalTrain, freeway entrance, about 2 miles away from a Hillsdale mall and walking distance to a smaller plaza that has Whole Foods, Starbucks, The Habit Burgers, a sushi place, Crunch gym, etc.). Aside from the location, the decor and general feel of the complex is sophisticated yet fun. I saw Christmas lights from balconies, a park right in the middle of the complex, plus ample gated underground parking and street parking. The streets were clean and nicely lined, people were walking their pets, families were enjoying the nearby restaurants and the community has amenities - lounge area, pool, gym. Also has modern kitchen upgrades like stain steel appliances, granite countertops and has washer/dryer in unit behind a door that features additional above shelving. Sounds like a dream right?! Unfortunately I arrived about an hour after the leasing office was closed but I knew this was a place I needed to check out. Later that night I did research online for pricing information, background on management company, read other reviews and basically anything else to prepare me for a thorough tour process the next morning. Nothing I saw didn't turn me off too much. The most negative thing I was was price (but it was still in my budget) and about 3-5 Yelp reviews from a few years ago that said residents had some package delivery issues. One stated packages were stolen from other residents because they were delivered on their doorstep. Another said they didn't like the mail because they had to walk to the office for larger packages. Considering the benefits, reading those reviews wasn't a deal breaker for me. While I do shop online, the positive reviews outweighed the negative by far. As far as the price, everything in San Mateo is expensive, especially compared to where I moved from. (Fun Fact: Las Vegas rent is about 3 - 5 times LOWER than San Mateo and the general Silicon Valley area.)

Following the agent felt like Going through a guided maze at first. The complex units look uniformed. It's one of the those places where you get used to knowing where you're going but you will need to give guests detailed directions to your specific unit. Otherwise they will get lost.

The 2 bedroom unit I saw was immaculate. It's a roommate style layout so rooms are on opposite sides of the unit, there is an island in the middle, the dining and living area is open. The master bathroom has a separate shower and garden tub. Both bathrooms have his and hers granite sinks and are huge! Think like five star restaurants that have 1 large bathroom stall. They are spacious with tile floors with multiple counter drawers and linen closets inside. The non-master bathroom has a large garden tub and shower combo plus the curved shower curtain to add the feeling of more space when washing up. There are walk in closets with pre installed additional shelving.

They agent led me through complex amenities. I saw everything except for the pool. It was under reconstruction. The lounge area is nice for party rentals and large groups on friends over. The gym isn't the biggest but it's spread out in multiple rooms. One for cardio. All the machines have individual TV screens so you don't have to watch what someone else does. There is a yoga studio room and a free weights room.< /review>

<Date>1451424104181< /Date><Text>My wife and I went to Park Place at San Mateo Apartments as our 3rd apartment to view that same day. We immediately noticed the professionalism and kind greeting with no pressure to sign papers right away. Daniel Fairbanks was very good and asked us what we were looking for and when we planned on moving in. After understanding our needs/requirements, he mapped out 2-3 apartments for us that were ready to move in to see and told us the pros and cons of each. We also walked the grounds which included the gym, pool table area, lounge/reading area as well as the outside where we saw 2 parks, a walking area for dogs and an underground garage. We were told there is an olympic size pool, but its currently under construction. We fealt very secure knowing you need a key to access anywhere in the apartment except for the lobby. We were also told there is very little crime in the area which is reassuring. There were also several stores and restaurants(Italian, Japense, Middle Eastern, etc), cleaners, grocery store(Whole Foods), etc within walking distance which was a big plus. After seeing the apartments (which includes central heating/air, built in speaker connections,stainless steel appliances, garbage disposal, energy efficient lighting) we realized this was the best overll fit for us for the price. I transitioned to a job in Palo Alto, so the commute is only between 25-35 minutes depending on traffic. Once we made our decision to rent, we worked with Melanie Kreitz on getting the lease filled out online, which was a pretty pain free and straight forward process with her guidance. She was very helpful and friendly which helped in the overall experience. I look forward to moving in and being part of the Park Place community in a few weeks. Daniel also mentioned if you need rental furniture, Park Place has a special discount with Cort Furniture and that they already know the layout of each sized room so know what fits best. I have not looked into it yet, but may to get some pricing. Thanks Daniel and Melanie for making my transition a seemless and stress free one!</Text>< user_name>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>So, I moved to Park Place after relocating to CA from FL. It was a GREAT first step into the Bay Area. Yes, it is expensive to live in Park Place, but it really isn't more or less expensive than the other places in Bay Meadows.

I was in a renovated unit (granite and "wood" floors) and it was decent enough. The big thing for me was a washer and dryer, as I have kids, and the unit I was in had a full size W/D which is almost unheard of in the Bay Area I feel.

The grounds are nice, two lovely parks. It probably could be mowed a bit more, and pet owners in the community could be better about picking up after their pets. But that isn't exactly a ding on Park Place, just pets owners at Park Place. The only thing I would maybe ding them for is not really being big on the pets off leash thing... but again, aside from stern emails... I don't know what else they could really do.

The apartment was clean when we moved in, only a few little issues that were fixed immediately. I loved the size, and the tub is HUGE.

Parking is great and included in rent, 1 br gets 1 spot assigned underground in the garage. Guest parking lacks a little, but we never had REAL issues, just annoyances on a busy weekend night.

The office and clubhouse is great. Downstairs gym/lounge kicks serious butt. Super nice! The lounge upstairs is great... and you can rent it... for like 4 hours in the evening for WAY too much... so just kind of pretend you can't. It isn't a big enough deal to detract a star or anything.

The staff is also helpful, Dan is (excuse the use of this) the man! I worked from home there, and probably pestered them WAY too much, but they were always warm and welcoming.

They also have a package room in the office, which some people love, some people hate. I personally love it! But I was always on top of it, and preferred the security.

Move out was easy, and I didn't see any crazy charges. I would recommend reading things carefully, and checking things. As I misinterpreted something on the statement and thought I was billed incorrectly. I called and acted a fool, but their good customer service skills talked me down off the cliff, and they showed me politely and respectfully that I in fact can't read apparently... so, because of that especially, they get 5 stars... I was an ass and they were super polite back at me.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808f9ee1755c2c41:0xf1d46f90d92f7eda<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I came here because of off the menu to redeem a personal bbq pizza, and this place is dope. The owner, Von, is really nice and made my pizza quickly. BBQ pizza is also very delicious. Tomato sauce AND bbq sauce and a good amount of chicken. Menu also has some delicious wings flavors and sandwiches.< /review>

They pizza is really good however they get 2 stars because they open whenever they want to which is not cool!! So today 8/23 I go online to see what time are they open the website says its open so I call to place an order and BOOM 💥 the phone is disconnected.....so I decided hey what the heck I'll drive up there since online it says there open and BOOM 💥  they are close... So if you ever decide to eat here I suggest you call whenever they decide to get a phone 📱 or you will be wasting your time< /Text>

< Review>
The pizza was only fine, and they didn't even provide much topping, which further dampened the experience. It was as if half a handful was used for the whole 1-topping pizza. My friends and I weren't impressed.</Review>

5 stars purely because they took our order exactly at closing and I feel bad for keeping them late. The pizza is better than what the previous tenants suggested when I asked them of a good local pizza spot. It's definitely a local spot. They are worth a try if you live in the area.<//Text>

Really cool staff plus they are attentive when placing your order in the store. I also am happy that they have Eritrean/Ethiopian food as well because I love different cultures and cuisine and don't have to travel all the way to The Fairfax District to enjoy good food!< /review>

Completely dissatisfied with their service. I called and asked the woman who answered the phone for a “barbecue chicken and bacon pizza with barbecue sauce NOT pizza sauce.” Four times before getting off the phone I specifically told her barbecue sauce NOT pizza sauce. When I get to the restaurant I left with the pizza home without checking it because I had ordered from this restaurant PLENTY of times without any issues. I get home and it’s pizza with chicken and bacon and barbecue drizzled on the top. So I return to the restaurant, I’m talking to the woman who answered the phone and took my order she’s explaining to me how she’s new and didn’t understand, but after explaining to her that I repeatedly asked for barbecue sauce she directed me to her manager who was upset that I was upset, but his anger was directed at me. He explained to me the price difference although I was not provided with a receipt upon first purchase and that he would give me a Barbecue pizza. And I’m like okay yes under the impression that he would be giving me what I asked for but with barbecue sauce. So after waiting at the restaurant for the pizza to be finished, the woman brings out a barbecue pizza with pepperoni, bacon, bell peppers, and barbecue sauce. So I told her, this is not what I asked for, I just wanted the same bacon and chicken with barbecue sauce in place of the marinera. So when she got the manager again, I told him. And he replied “I’m not going to play games with you,” so I requested my money back. Because instead of clarifying what I had asked for he gave me an attitude as if I wasn’t spending MY money in that business. So I got a refund and I absolutely would NEVER refer anyone else to this establishment because they were in a rush to take my money but never listened once to what I wanted on the pizza I was paying for. I am disgusted with the customer service there. If I could give less than a one star I would have.<//review>

<Review>I haven't visited this place yet but with all those 360° views it makes it look like a past or future crime scene. If you have security cameras that took those pictures it will be helpful when it's aired on the first48. All those 360° images detract from your business and does not make it appealing and in your case less would be more.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Pizza Rossa is my favorite pizza joint in all the land. Try the BBQ Chicken Pie for one awesome reason above just being a really good pizza.   Above the feeling of being full will come with a feeling of true Greatness and superior way about you if you order this one.  "WHY HOW COULD IT BE?" You ask.

Because it is the most expensive pizza they have to offer there and almost three times the price of what 100% of everyone else picks up for dinner ; the daily 5.99 large one topping special.

No pizza I've had here is bad by any means and all the price is high in their BBQ chicken pie is basic supply and Demand or somebody who sets the price reading into the demographics of the town.  What buying this pizza does is inenveerantly pit you against the rest of the culture and bring out the haters in anyone who is unlucky enough to be around to witness you buying it.

Maybe I'm saying all this because I live so close to it and the convenience factor sends it over the top or maybe because it's just cheap and awesome, have a slice and call me when your done if you wanna be the judge.

I recommend the pepperoni and jalapeño or chicken bbq ranch hot and right out the oven with Sriracha.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

<text>If you want to waste your time and money, hire these crooks.

For $1000+ their VAs will send you a canned template, a 1 paragraph letter, they send to every other seller.

If you object to the quality and lack of professionalism, or lack of time they take to understand your case, they will boot you out the door, saying they spent lots of time on your case and your contract is finished with them.

I worked with them and the another company, and the difference is from here to the moon. The other company took time to understand my issue, crafted a custom solution and actually helped.

This company is only around because they understand how to manipulate their public image with the reviews all over google. Stay away. You stand a 80%+ chance of getting scammed with these people.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>118286567996224026555</userid><response>{'time': 1612371188008, 'text': 'This is a duplicate review from Tanya Veleva.

Very tough case! Almost lost hope

I wanted to thank Valentina and her team for the help they have been providing. The case was very tough, even one of the toughest Valentina and her team had! I created an Amazon account and the verification took to long and I created another one, this one immediately got blocked because of being related to that old account ( NEVER DO THIS!). After trying a lot of things I decided to contact Amazon Sellers Attorney. It took a long time to have the problem solved but Valentina and her team were very patient. Finally I can start my Amazon adventure. Guys, whoever is reading this. Please do not try to solve Amazon issues just by yourself, let the people, professionals in these matters do their work. TIME IS MONEY!!</text>

Wow, what a process!  Kenneth and Leito came through and helped me to restore one of my main listings.  Very pleased with their level of professionalism and persistence.

Highly recommended!<//Review>

Do NOT hire this company unless you want to get royally scammed.

My experience with them:

1. They lied to get my business - I asked for assistance with seller verification escalation and expedition of the review. Their chat VA told me they handle seller verification.

2. They delivered a canned template, completely irrelevant to my case, it was about suspended  accounts and none of it made any sense, as the POA was referring to suspended listings and Amazon listing guidelines, none of which applicable to my situation.

3. I expressed my concerns they weren’t qualified to handle my case, and that the template was irrelevant., The owner Kennet Eade, literally said: "Our fee was earned the minute you signed the agreement and we provided the advice you chose not to take" - essentially giving me the boot, and refusing to take responsibility for the fact they failed to fill out their contractual obligations.

4. I wanted to give them a chance to wipe their hands clean of the contract by refunding me, after they wasted so much of my time, and I waited days counting on their assistance.

5. They refused, so I took it up with my bank as a dispute.

6. Kenneth Made flooded my bank in response to the dispute with 57 pages of legalese arguing he delivered the service, which he did not.

***If you still  have any doubt as to the integrity of this company, know they will work harder to steal your money than to actually help you and deliver a usable solution.

To make matters worse:

The owner of the company has a history of deceitful, predatory business practices, and my interactions with him and his team confirm this. But don't take my word for it. Just check some of the facts + images I will upload and post below.

A company's word and service is as good as the integrity of its owner. Kenneth Gordon Eade has a history of scamming consumers (and not only, as you'll come to find out).

SEC Lawsuit, Misleading Consumers by Misrepresenting Financial Statements

To start, between 2012 - 2014, after litigation from the SEC, his attorney license was suspended for a period of 5 years until very recently, as he aided and abetted the company’s violation of securities laws and drafted false and misleading periodic filings that were filed with the SEC, omitting some material facts and misrepresenting others.  Eade eventually settled, agreeing to pay considerable fines and disgorgement.

Multiple (12) Attorney License Suspensions by the State Bar of California

Kenneth Eade has a long record of disciplinary action with the State Bar of California. According to their records, Eade was suspended from practice 12 times, an unusually high number.

Predatory Business Behaviour

In 2011 he brought an absurd “basher” lawsuit against the Investor’s Hub online financial forum and a number of its members, initially announcing that he sought $400 million in damages.  IHub responded with an anti-SLAPP action that eventually prevailed, and Eade was required to pay the defendant’s legal costs.  Eade never obtained the real names and locations of the “bashers” he sued as John and Jane Does, though he did manage to misidentify two of them along the way.

Multiple Better Business Bureau Complaints

Amazon Sellers Attorney (rated C) has multiple complaints on their BBB profile you'll never see on their social media review accounts.

ALTERNATIVE

There are reputable companies out there, I've worked with Ecommerce Chris in the past, who's extremely knowledgeable and as a former Amazon Senior Executive from including on Seller Performance, he intimately knows the ins and outs of navigating Amazon. Highly recommend him, he has integrity, unlike this scammy company.

Full disclosure - I am not affiliated in any way with Ecomm Chris, I’m just another business owner like you, who was scammed by Amazon Sellers Attorney and want to help prevent their predatory behavior from scamming others.<//text>

From the beginning, the client did not understand that her seller account had been suspended, and got hung up on the semantics of this.  When we amended her appeal, we used her suggested verbiage, but she never could forget our initial assessment, which Amazon verified, that her account had been suspended for failing verification per Amazon's notice of June 22, 2020.  Amazon also asked her for an official document to show the scope of activity of the LLC and she sent them a letter signed by herself.  We counseled her that a letter was not an acceptable official document, but she could amend her LLC operating agreement to provide them with such a document that would most likely be accepted.  She also insisted that she did not need a plan of action, although she had written an ineffectual one herself (See client's plan of action of June 22, 2020).  After many communications with the client, wherein she was hostile and refused to accept our professional advice, she claimed that all we did was provide her with a template.  We are experts at verification suspension, which is all about the documents you submit to Amazon.  We spent hours reviewing the client's materials and counseling her.

<text>After 3 weeks of trying to have our listing reactivated (after suddenly being deactivated for unknown copyright infringement claims), we reached out to Mr. Eade and his team for legal counsel to deal with Amazon. After a week and a half, 2 appeal responses later, our listing was reactivated.

Quick turnaround - when they say they will have appeal responses ready within 48 hrs, they mean it. Responsive team, with someone always returning my phone calls & emails within 12-24 hrs, usually sooner. Amazon is frustrating to deal with when it comes to sellers and having legal support to draft responses amenable to Amazon's litany of rules was a huge help.

Thank you!< /text><name>Lisa Khan</name>< gmapID>

I HIGHLY recommend them. I had a very very complicated Amazon Suspension Case. 3 Suspended accounts.  I had 2 related account issues, as well as an authenticity and forged documents claim. Believe it or not the forged document and authenticity claim account was reopened. We are now waiting to submit documents for the other 2 accounts. Patience is key. The first two POA’s were rejected. Do not be disheartened. It took over 2 weeks but thanks to Amazon Sellers Attorney I’m almost out of this mess. 10/10 recommended. I first thought it was a scam and was very hesitant to pay them. But after some communication and research I knew I was dealing with the right guys. They know what they’re doing. Hopefully I can write an update soon with the other 2 accounts reopened.</text>

My account was suspended immediately after creation. Despite providing all the documentation, Amazon rejected it, they kept sending me the same template or ignoring my appeals for almost a year.

I contacted Amazon Sellers Attorney and my account was reinstated in two weeks. I had to read the email twice because I didn't believe it. I thought it would take months after several appeals.

They replied fast to my doubts, wrote the appeal in less than 48 hours, and gave me some advice to prevent a new suspension.

It’s very hard to find good attorneys. I’m glad I found them.<//text>

DO NOT FALL FOR IT

After speaking with this group Amazon Sellers Attorney over the phone, through chats, and emails I felt assured that they would be able to help me get my Amazon Seller's account reinstated, HOWEVER that never happened...

I decided to go with their 'services' and ended up receiving some generic drafts of emails with fill-in-the-blank sections with my info input inside of.

I did as they suggested and sent the emails, the escalations, the reminders, etc... I was informed to keep waiting as it may take time to receive a response from Amazon. It has been over 10 months now and I still have not received one single reply/response from Amazon.

After seeing absolutely no results, I kindly asked for a partial refund if not full and they refused. I filed a claim with the bank, showing all of my proof of my emails back and forth with Amazon Sellers Attorney and me doing as they suggested and not receiving any response from Amazon and it was denied.

I truly feel I was offered falsely rendered services and expectations.

I truly feel robbed and scammed.

It is not easy for me to come out and share all of this but I feel it will help others steer clear from falling into the same trap.<//Review>

<Text>ASA helped get my account back within a week of being hired and to end 2 weeks of a stressful suspension for Related accounts. The appeal they wrote for me was very thorough and tailored to my case. Surprisingly the same appeal did the job on the second submission. This shows they know very well the psychology of Seller central and how they work. Mr. Kenneth also then gave me important guidance on how to prevent my account from being suspended again in the future. I'm very happy to have entrusted ASA to this mission!</Text><user>106459458658619320747</user><Date>1592553045451<//Date>< Rating>

THIS SERVICE IS A SCAM

They did not review my case properly. Sent me a generic template with policy names I never violated, as if mentioning them would help my case.

When I pointed this out, they insisted the template they sent me was legitimate and would help me even though it didn't describe my issue.

I told them I can't use it, and they refused further help. I feel scammed.

Stay away, they are a collection of phonies! The lawyer who supposedly runs the company is not even a practicing lawyer as his license is suspended.< /Text>

Our Amazon account got suspended for in authenticity complaints. We tried to appeal ourselves, as we do not sell fake items, but amazon wouldn't reactivate our account.
We hired Mr. Gordon Eade and he has submitted 2 appeals already. We are sure that our account will be open soon, as we see how professional the appeals are!
Michelle at the office is so kind and is always responsive and quick.
Thank you guys for great customer service and your hard work :)</text>

Couldn't appreciate enough. A Top service, thanks very much to Ken for sorting out the case. Amazon can be tough without a lawyer. Once Ken got onto the case, we felt re-assured and had faith this matter would be resolved. After sometime from getting the complaint retracted from the rights owner, Ken helped us to also reinstate the listings. Most importantly, you need to have faith and patience both when it comes to Amazon nightmares. Thanks very much for a top service!</text>

THE BEST TOP  Attorney for amazon sellers!
Mr. Kenneth Eade has worked for our amazon seller accounts many times and helped to fix tons of complicated cases. What impressed us is not only his outstanding knowledge and professional experience, but also his care and accountability. Due to covid 19 pricing gouging issue amazon suspended 9 of our listings which damaged our seller performance big time. Even though we are established seller with 7 years history on Amazon, our account is still under the safety review. Mr. Eade and his team read though all the materials we provided and wrote us very detailed appeal letter addressed to the specific Amazon department . After he appeal failed, he spent more time to review it and sent us revision for re-appealing. After 2 months back and forth, we got 7 out 9 reinstated.  We can’t express how much we appreciate his amazing work. Moreover, he is so humble and willing to listen to us all the time. Never complains about the complication of our cases. Highly recommended to all the amazon sellers this trustful man who takes the pride in his work. Many many thanks!< /text>

I have reached out to Kenneth to reinstate my account that had been suspended for several months.  Kenneth and his team were very prompt in responding and showed great mastery.   I also appreciated very much how clear and transparent he has been during the whole process.  I definitely recommend using his services and would gladly work with him again if I have any trouble with my account.</Review>

I can't say enough good about Kenneth.  He has done several types of work for our company, and we have been happy.  Most notably he helped us successfully get our suspended account reinstated on Amazon.  He was tireless and responsive and continued with repeated, nuanced attempts that finally resulted in success.  Our situation was a difficult one and we are so happy with the result and so grateful for his expertise.  There is no doubt that we could not have done this without him.  We have already referred a friend with a year-long suspension to him and I bet he will get it done.  Highly, highly recommend Kenneth.< /text>

After our account was suspended by Amazon, I tried myself to get it reinstated, with no luck. I contacted Kenneth and his team. They drafted an appeal. I sent it through and my account was reinstated! Best move I ever made!! Kenneth and his team are the best!! Recommended A+++</review>

<text>We were spending money and wasting time with CJ Rosenbaum's Amazon sellers lawyer for a couple of months while they've tried very inefficiently and poorly to write appeal after appeal that were rejected by Amazon.  They got us into suspension and after 2 unsuccessful appeals with POA and 1 week of suspension we finally did the right thing and hired Amazon Sellers Attorney

Oh my god!!  That made a difference!! Ken wrote an expedited appeal on our case in 4 hours. We submitted it and got reinstated the next day! He knew exactly who to go to, what to do, what to write in the subject line and how to escalate the case at the lower level of notice-dispute.  This was so great and we are very happy with everything!

We will be going to Amazon Sellers Attorney for all of our Amazon issues as he delivers results and his fees are much lower then everybody else you  can find out there.

Absolutely fabulous! Stop wasting your time and money. Hire Amazon Sellers Attorney. Ken is more knowledgeable and can right an appeal better then anybody else!</text>< username>

Amazon suspended my two listings due to trademark infringement. I did everything i was asked by Amazon to resolve the complaint with the trademark holder and eventually the trademark holder retracted the complaint and sent an email directly to Amazon sellers to reinstate my account.

However, Amazon seller did not respond to the retraction email sent by the patent holder. They did not respond to my emails either. They actually rejected my appeals for the same reason they suspended my listings even though we DID present all the requirements.

So we found Kenneth online and he sounded very familiar with my issues and laid out the steps he would take to tackle the issues.

NOTE: He did not tell me that he is 100% sure that my listing will be reinstated. But his plans of action convinced me he was the best person to hire. I liked his honesty.

So his plans of action helped to be reinstated with less than a week period of time.

I want to thank Kenneth and his assistant for their professionalism.</text>

I reached Kenneth after my account has been suspended for more than 3 months, and he and his team with their professionalism in writing plan of actions and the right communication, successfully reinstated the account. Just smooth and perfect are the right words to describe the whole situation. Thank you very much Kenneth!<//Review>

Kenneth is an expert in the Amazon minefield. His knowledge and experience with Amazon resulted in my listing being successfully restored.
My listing was unfairly deactivated and like an impenetrable city, Amazon refused to answer emails and phone contact was impossible. Kenneth knew how to navigate Amazon successfully. He wrote an excellent appeal and guided me through the whole process, all for an extremely reasonable fee.
His office was professional, kind and helpful whenever I called and Kenneth was always quick to respond to my emails.
Kenneth is a professional and one worth keeping in your contact list.< /review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>I was very reluctant about hiring help online to get my Amazon account back. Amazon is extremely strict and will suspend an account for even the smallest of reasons. I went through the ASM program and even had my mentors who are very knowledgeable try to help me get my account back and I personally tried to appeal my suspension several times without any avail. I was very much invested in my Amazon business financially and losing my account effected me in a big way. I was extremely stressed by this and when I spoke with Leito on the phone for the first time I felt so much better about my decision. I was quick to get the ball rolling and provide Kenneth with the needed documentation and they were just as quick in getting back to me every single time without delay. They got my account back and I am so grateful for that. I felt that I was taken care of and I wasn't just a number. I would recommend their services to friends and family. Quick, Professional, and Effective.<//Text>< user>

Attorney Ken has helped me to reinstate my account after 3 months suspended. Follow his advice and patiently waiting long time and finally my account reinstate. He helped me to draft email to send to Jeff Bezos. Finally attorney Ken decides to also send fax to Amazon legal department. After that amazon reinstate my account. Attorney Ken is know what he is doing to help his client.

We had an issue with product “used sold as new” and our account suspended. We have been selling for many years and have had this issue before and know its due to customer returned goods being put back into stock, even though we have the settings correct so this shouldn’t happen. Anyway we got as far as we could and then decided we needed professional help! I contacted Kenneth on a Saturday and we then submitted his revised plan on Tuesday and were immediately reinstated. Fantastic service! Then in typical Amazon fashion I received a call a week or so later and the whole suspension thing started again. I told them I had just gone through this but apparently they had no record. So I went back to Kenneth and he again revised the plan and we were reinstated again. If you have any problem with your Amazon account Kenneth Eade is the man to go to.  Very reasonable pricing as well. Thanks again Kenneth.< /text>

<review>We were unfairly suspended for intellectual property allegations not related to our listings or products, and ai triggered our unfair suspension. K Gordon assured us if we were persistent, we had a good shot at winning. He helped us with over a dozen addenda and after the 19th attempt, we reached a Senior Investigative Manager who reinstated our account and amazon apologized for erring on the side of caution. Yes it stunk to be suspended for 26 days during which time saying we were high maintenance to this attorney with contact is an understatement, but the persistence, patience, and continued gathering of information and retractions by the attorneys no doubt helped our case. Amazon doesn't read all your appeals and you must persist and keep providing details and a thorough Plan of Action which is concise, uses the right language, and the right supporting documents to reach management. They knew how to do this and had a few tricks up their sleeves to help. Recommended without reservation.<//review>< pics>

AMAZON SELLERS ATTORNEY, LTD and Kenneth Eade got our 40 products reinstated on Amazon. Without them I believe would still be fighting to restate our products. There was a big company claiming we were infringing on their patent Kenneth took our information and got Amazon to realize we were not infringing on their patent and we are now able to sell all our 40 ASIN’s. Thank You so much Kenneth and all of AMAZON SELLERS ATTORNEY, LTD.< /Review>

After our listing on Amazon was blocked, we were trying to reinstate our listing for two week with no results..., so we found Kenneth in internet. His response was prompt, and all communication was professional and very helpful. If it wasn't for his help, we wouldn't have reinstated our  listing by ourselves. Thanks to Kenneth and his team for quickly resolving our problem and we will certainly keep his contact in the need  again.  We highly recommend Kenneth and his team Amazon Sellers Attorney<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Our business exploded overnight and Amazon began holding all of our funds. Within a month, they were holding >$80K, and we were having trouble purchasing more inventory to keep up with the demand since Amazon was holding all of the proceeds of our sales. We then read posts online that made us concerned whether Amazon would ever release the funds, and if they did, it sounded like it may take many months (or even a year) before we'd be paid.

We contacted Amazon Sellers Attorney to try to get some clarity on our situation to determine if it was wise to proceed, or if we needed to stop selling before we had any further issues. They were invaluable and gave us the knowledge we needed to make a wise decision on how we should proceed -- without charging us anything for the consult. The insights they gave us allowed us to continue selling on Amazon, quintupling our business in just one year.

We could not have done it without the kind and generous advice and assistance from Amazon Sellers Attorney!</Review>< Pictures>

<user>117012046941392773323<//user><Review>Dear Amazon Sellers Family. I am non US resident, Amazon EU experienced seller. Scaling the business I decided to open US Amazon Seller Account. Over 3 months of horrible account registration process - its failed because of lack of information why Amazon didn't accept all my legal documents with the main one - Utility Bill. I lost the ideas and faith how to figure out this issue. The last chance I decided to do was Kenneth Eade cooperation. I made detailed resume of all my emails with Seller Performance. Mr. Kenneth prepared appeal which was sent. After the 12 hours my account has been reactivated. Amazed. Really Incredible. I definitely recommend Amazon Sellers Attorney as the highest professionals on the market.</Review>< GmapID>

Kenneth, got my Amazon seller account back.  I was banging my head going back and forth with Amazon seller support for a month.  I asked Kenneth for help.  He saw the flaw in my appeal and wrote me a new one.  I submitted to Amazon and got the $3K they were holding from me and the ability to sell on the platform again.

Kenneth and his staff were responsive to chat and email.  In addition, they were courteous and prompt with responses.  I highly recommend their services. It is a bargain price considering the alternative, because let's face it, without the ability to sell on Amazon most of us do not have better options.</Review>

I used Amazon Sellers Attorney when our company was accused of violating IP of another Amazon seller.  The complaint was from a company who frequently attacks competitor's Amazon listings.  Kenneth was very familiar with the complaining company and was able to quickly put in motion the steps to get my listing live again.  He and his staff were always readily available for my questions and concerns.  The issue was rectified and our listing was reinstated.  Many thanks to Kenneth's expertise and service.</text>

I received a fantastic and professional service from Kenneth Eade when my seller account was suspended and my account was reinstated in less than 24hrs after submitting my appeal! Thank you so much Kenneth for saving me from my sleepless nights.
Folks, if your seller account has been suspended and you have appealed yourself without success then definately email the details to Kenneth to see if he can help and if he says yes then just pay the fees and go for it! Good Luck!!< /text>

Kenneth and his team are professional, prompt, concise, thorough and relentless. I was initially worried about hiring anyone to submit an Amazon appeal but after I hired Ken, my worries were eased and I let them do their magic. My account was restored and I now have a better understanding of Amazon and their appeal process. I was kept abreast of all upcoming submissions and changes to make sure we followed all the proper protocol.
If you have been pinched by Amazon, don't even think about doing it yourself. Hire a real PRO!!!</text>

<Review>I was suspended by Amazon without explanation and it is like pulling teeth to get answers through Seller Support. Luckily, I heard about Kenneth Eade! He gave me the confidence when I thought all was lost that something could be done. I had read reviews where it took years for some sellers to get reinstated.  In a little over a month, he had Amazon giving me permission to sell again. I am very thankful to Ken and would not waste time or money anywhere else. His price is very reasonable by the way. Also what amazed me was that when I sent him a question, I literally got a response right away, that was so impressive.</Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Response>

I suddenly found myself in a situation where I was suspended from Amazon. I tried to get myself re-instated but it was quite obvious very quickly that I was out of my depth. So I contacted a company that made huge promises and statements about how good they were at resolving Amazon disputes. However it unfortunately became clear that they were quite frankly incompetent. I decided to have one more attempt. Even though after my attempts and the other companies attempts. A considerable amount of damage had been done. Immediately I found Kenneth responsive and constructive with his assistance. After explaining the state of the case. Kenneth attacked it with Vigour and even though it still took several weeks of battling. Kenneth got me re-instated. I cannot speak highly enough of Kenneth’s service and after a number of failed attempts he is the only guy to deal with Amazon disputes!! Good Job!!<//review>

My listing was deactivated due to a safety complaint. I have no experience in this matter and did not want to waste time going through trial and error with Amazon and more lost sales. I hired Kenneth immediately, he knew the exact language Amazon needed to reinstate my product. I submitted the Plan Of Action he prepared and was active within 24 hours. I am so grateful for his help!<//Review>

I receive a complaint about Used sold as New from Amazon and i know that the complaint is due to Amazon reselling the return product to other buyer. I send me POA to Amazon and got rejected twice. I found Kenneth when i was googling solution for this. Kenneth is very professional and very good about what he is doing. I send the POA that Kenneth prepare and my listing got reinstate within hours. I would highly recommend Kenneth to other seller that need a help from an attorney.<//review>

Kenneth has been great, very responsive and extremely knowledgeable in this area. You definitely need Kenneth on your side when dealing with Amazon Seller Performance. I know that without the help that Kenneth was able to give I would not have stood a chance at getting my Amazon account open again, anyone looking for help in this area should not even think twice about contacting Kenneth, I would recommend Kenneth to anyone who has been unfortunate enough to have had to go through a similar situation with Amazon.<//Text>

<text>Have to say that in your hour of need Kenneth is a proven source to go to. From minute one of our unfounded suspension Kenneth calmed us down and explained the process. This is happening to lots of sellers and hugely costly but your dealing with a black box of information that you can’t get access to. Kenneth helped us get our account back up and running but it was for more than we were expecting for the fee. Highly highly recommend.<//text><date>1516989640917< /date><Response>None< /Response><name>Repair Man< /name>< gmapID>

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ANYONE ELSE.  KEN IS YOUR GUY!  I searched around for someone to help me with my Amazon account that was prohibited from selling for nearly 3 years.  I had emailed Amazon on many occasions to no avail.  I relentlessly asked them what they needed from me or what they were looking for but never got a solid answer.  I began to search online for a company that might be able to help.  Most of the places claiming they could help didn’t even have a phone number but I found one that looked legitimate.  I called Ken's office, he picked up the phone and after talking with him he assured me this was fixable.   Long story short, my account has been reactivated and he accomplished what he said he could do and did it quickly and professionally.  THANKS KEN!< /text>

Excellent experience.  Amazon suspended our account for infringement claims falsely filed against us by unethical company. We did everything Amazon required to get us back online but to no avail. We contacted Ken and his team for assistance.  They created a very professional appeal to Amazon and got our account reinstated. Would highly recommend Ken and his team.</Review>

I was referred to Kenneth and he didn’t disappoint! My amazon account was suspended based on reviews. I learned how to better get reviews which were compliant with amazon, and Ken helped me on a POA which we had to escalate and took 3 weeks but finally received a response and am now reinstated! He and his team have fast response times, talk with you, give you statistics from past issues they solved, and I’ve been happy with his services from start to finish.</text>

< Review>
Thanks to Kenneth. I had spent 2 months to appeal to Amazon since suspended. Failed with extremely frustrated finally after 2 attempts of appeal.  In the last minute before I give up in my desperation, I came across Kenneth's ads about his service. Let's try then. Believe it should be better than nothing. Having submitted the documents and the action plan according to Kenneth's instruction, I had been preparing to be tormented by Amazon for a few weeks for my 3rd appeal. I couldn't believe, my account has been reinstated just next day of the document submission. You are great Kenneth. I am very regret -- I should get him with me 2 months ago,!!!<//Review>

Kenneth is an expert in the Amazon minefield.
My account was unfairly suspended ,Amazon refused to answer emails , Kenneth knew how to navigate Amazon successfully. He wrote an excellent appeal and guided me through the whole process, all for an extremely reasonable fee.

Kenneth helped us get out of a very tricky situation with our Amazon seller account. He is very knowledgeable of all situations that can happen with your seller account. He knows how to write the appeal that will get your problem resolved in no time. He is so easy to work with, incredibly fast in responding and no question goes unanswered. He's a pleasure to work with!<//review>

I am so glad I enlisted Kenneth Eade's help!  I am a new seller, and I ran into an issue registering my account.  Amazon had immediately suspended my account because they thought I was trying to register two seller accounts.  I had started registering the account, but decided to hold off, and not complete it, until I had additional information I needed.
When I went back to complete the registration, Amazon thought I was trying to open two accounts.  Mr. Eade was very helpful, and prompt with his responses and appeal letters. After escalating the appeal to Jeff Bezos' team, my account was reinstated within a few days.  Mr. Eade's services were affordable, and worth every penny.  I will not hesitate to hire him, again, if the need arises.< /review>

Kenneth helped me every step of the way - and trust me, there were a lot of steps!  This man is the real-deal, an actual attorney specializing in the needs of Amazon sellers.  Amazon can be overwhelming but Mr. Eade makes it easy, shoulders the burden, and helps you navigate the channels for, in my case, a very positive resolution.  If you need help, use this attorney!< /Text>

I got suspended for counterfeit goods which was not true but I hired Kenneth Eade at Amazon Sellers Attorney & after 5 days he was able to get my account reinstated. He is one of the best at reinstating accounts that i've seen and I've been selling on Amazon for over 8 years.</Review>

My listing had gotten removed for infringement. I tried calling amazon, emailing amazon, they wouldnt do anything to help me. The seller who reported me wouldnt respond either, I felt helpless. I called Kenneth and right away he went to work emailing amazon. It was like calling in the marines. He has gotten my listing re-instated and I am so glad I found him. I would recommend him to anyone.</review>

Amazon suspended my account due to IP infringement, I did everything amazon asked me to do to resolve the issue, I even got the trademark holder to retract his complaint, and still no success with amazon, they rejected all of my appeals.
a friend of mine suggested to contact Kenneth online, when I contacted him he was familiar with my issues, he replied fast on all my questions, he created a new plan of action for my case in less than 2 days and helped me reinstate my account right on time for Q4.
I cannot thank Kenneth Eade and Leito Guzman enough for their help.</Review>

Before working with Kenneth Eade we had some really bad experiences with other "high praised attorneys". They have been fast in charging money but super slow in taking action.

It´s a completely different experience with Ken. He took immediately action (did in less than 2h what the other attorney did in 2 weeks), came up with solutions, explained everything and got our product reinstated the fastest possible way. On top he´s just a nice guy!

As a Amazon Seller Reviews are obviously very important - Ken deserves nothing but 5-stars! I can definitely recommend him. He takes care of you and your business. Thanks a lot again!!< /text>

The situation that I found myself in with Amazon was completely devastating, and seemed all but impossible. After being in business for less than a year, I was just beginning to catch my stride.  One afternoon I received a call from a repeat customer, notifying me that they were unable to order the product.  I tried to long into my Amazon account, only to find that it was completely shut down.  I called Amazon and they didn’t give me any information, then proceeded to tell me to contact seller performance to see what the issue was.  I then sent an email to seller performance and within minutes I received and email stating that I was no longer allowed to sell on Amazon and if there if fraud or illegal activity that they do not have to release sells or product and that they would not be doing so in my case, nor were they going to tell me why.  I spoke to numerous attorneys, read multiple articles and blog, all expressing that getting the situation like mine, and resolving the matter was all but impossible.  I was completely blindsided and had no knowledge as to what happened or how to resolve it.  Mr. Eade is a very personable and knowledgeable attorney. When I spoke with Mr. Eade, and expressed to him the situation, without even reading their corresponding email to him, he was able to tell me exactly how it read.  He asked me a few questions about my business and was able to make an assessment, he was confident in his ability to get the decision reversed.  To be honest, because of the pessimism and the uncertainty of all the other attorneys that I had been in contact with, his confidence and optimism, initially gave me pause.   I was in a situation of nothing to lose.  Mr. Eade was able to get it reversed quickly and without any addition steps required.  I don’t know what the future hold, if I will ever need this type of service again, but if I do, I will use him every time.<//Text>

Most importantly Kenneth was there all the way with us till we managed to get our account back. We attribute his advice to be 100% the reason why we were able to get our account reinstated.

Amazon.ca had written sellers on Sept 6th that if we didn't have a Natural Product Number on our nutritional supplement labels by October all our listings would be removed. That gave us less than a month to get what takes usually 3-6 months to get. We had been selling and sending products across the borders for 3 years without any problems, customs would have stopped the shipments if an NPN was really needed. Mr Eade responded right away to my email, he went to work, did his research and came up with a plan. It worked and we are still selling. He was amazing!
He was always polite, to the point and on top of it. Right away I felt I was in good hands. I warmly recommend him if you have problems with Amazon. Thank you Mr Eade.</Review>

< review>
Mr. Eades, thank you so much for helping me get my listing reinstated from a Global company who I will not mention. Before finding Mr. Eades, the first company I paid was not able to get my listing reinstated. The second company I contacted did not want to touch the case due to it being such a large global brand I was going up against. Mr Eades was literally an Amazon angel sent from God. He worked swift and very professional. He kept me up to date every step of the way. Initially, the notice department rejected our appeal, but he immediately escalated the case to Amazons legal department. About three days later I had all ASINS reinstated. Mr. Eades knows his stuff and I would personally recommend him to any seller who needs assistance with appeals. He is one of the nicest and most hard working people I have ever met, and he truly cares about getting you up and running as soon as possible. He took my case as if it was his and would not let me get bullied by the “Global” brand I mentioned. Mr Eades you are awesome and I appreciate you so so much. I officially crown you the “Amazon Reinstatement Guru”.

God Bless, Jon<//review>

Amazon suspended one of my listings due to a misunderstanding on what does and does not require FDA approval. I tried to present evidence to seller support and got nowhere. At that point I contacted Kenneth for help getting my listing back. He immediately worked out a plan of action and a formal email for escalation to Jeff Besos. Within a couple weeks i got my listing back. Cant thank you enough Kenneth!< /Review>

<text>Thanks to Kenneth, I manged to get my account reinstated. I was in a difficult position, my account has been suspended for month and i have already sent multiple plans of action but amazon’s response was suspending my account and they said they will not respond to furthur emails regarding this matter.
However we managed to get it reinstated with a professionally written POA and an escalation plan.

The service was amazing and the support provided was good especially when it took Amazon longer than usual I alwayes found support from Kenneth.

Communication was brilliant with an extremly fast response on any enquiry at anytime wether by Kenneth himself or a member of his team.

Overall it was an excellent, professional, and supportive Amazon attorny service and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to reinstate his/her account.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>I contact quite a few IP lawyers when my list was suspended by AMAZON due to IP infringement. During initial free consultation, most of the lawyer focus on talking about their fee, only Kenneth listened to my problem and asked intelligent questions to proble which angle to approach the issues. He then explain options that I have in very detailed. He is always available on live chat and very quick on answer email. I normally don't like paying money to lawyer, but in this case, it is the best $500 I have ever spent in my life. Why? I have got my lising re-instate within 3 hours after he sent email to the seller. Highly recommend if you have any issuew with your AMAZON account.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Let me start by saying, there was only my wife and I and one person behind us... so it was not busy.
Drinks here were not very good  taste wise. Like they were watered down and foamy... no substance.
Wife and I ordered a caramel ribbon crunch and a mocha cookie crumble (I think thats what it was called). Both seasonal Frappuccino's.
Neither was any good at all. Service was subpar. Both drinks had caramel and chocolate dripping down the outside and the server couldn't care less. I asked her for napkins to clean both up and she grumbled and handed me ONE napkin. ALL Starbucks I've been to clean your cups before handing them over.
Both were placed on the counter without straws. She also grumbled when asked for two straws. Also she never gave me my receipt (I also forgot to ask for it though).
I'll never order here again!!</Text>

<Review>The staff at this location are sub par at best. Either this is a training store, or they can't keep employees. There's a new incompetent person working there every day. Not only are they dense, but they're rude to go along with the poor drink knowledge. I've had sighs for simple requests, eye rolls for multiple drinks, and they will walk away from you.
I am no Karen. I just want to order my drink and get out. I'm not picky. Maybe on the amount of ice that is in my drink but that is it. I dont think it warrants such behavior.
They are also constantly out of product. Any time I go over here I have to change what I want because they dont have the ingredients. If you can avoid this location, I would. Awful.<//Review>< pictures>

On school days , this place is packed , which means sometimes the items won't be available, there will be a very long line, and no place to sit. So if your looking for a quick bite or drink for your morning or afternoon Mon-Fri , you shouldn't come here lol.

This place is perfect to play pokemon go because you can relax in the smell of coffee and use a lure.</Text>

<Review>Maybe it was a new employee, maybe it was because this SB is inside Vons but it seems like the quality was lacking.  Ordered a frap but got something that simultaneously tasted worse than slim fast but had 3x more calories.<//Review>< Rate>

This is inside a grocery store. Stop putting these on Google Maps! They should have a special name for this type of Starbucks.  StarMarkets. Or maybe Starbuckitos? No one wants to go inside a grocery store to get a coffee!</review>

<review>This Starbucks is located right as you walk in the vons, and is a fairly small vons-type Starbucks. There was only one staff on at the time and she handled the orders very well.
I’m not sure if it was just early but they didn’t have the cinnamon/nutmeg/vanilla out.
Also I don’t think this location accepts Mobile orders.<//review>< pictures>

I don’t know what’s going on at this location lately but the service has been pure garbage. My drinks horrific. The girl that works there is unprofessional and uncaring. She is friendly when handing you your order but she talks about customers in from of customers and is a bad barista. Her and the guy working there  talk too much during crowded peaks. She so unfocused I watched her mess up one drink 3 times. She was so busy complaining she was distracted.  The last few times I tried to get a green tea latte, caramel brûlée 2x  the coffees were awful. I promise I donot like to give bad reviews because I work dealing with the public but it’s pretty bad here. They also have a promo where you can buy reusable cups. My daughter and I have tried several times to buy one and each time they never have or know where the tops are. At what point do you find the the tops or let your manager know this is going on? I used to love this location and I miss the other 2 young ladies that used to work this location. One went on maternity leave came back for a bit and left again and the other left sometime after the last holidays hopefully on to bigger and better things.
Anyways Starbucks GET THIS LOCATION TOGETHER PLEASE! This is my favorite Vons and it’s convenient to grab coffee but now I just pass this one up.</Text>

Need more staff on weekday mornings.  HS students nearby swarm the place if you don't get there by 715am. Staff is always good but often overwhelmed.< /Review>

It replaced a fairly priced store branded booth. Their regular roast doesn't thrill me at all and is overpriced to boot. Their 'special' roasts are Never available outside of the morning hours. The now Starbucks owned Tazo tea is AWFUL - employees even warned me away from it.
Why does this place have so many fanboys?</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>They saved my Christmas. I have a lexus Gs300 my headlights went out and lexus dealer wanted to charge me 2200. I said heck naw did my research found this place read their reviews and took a chance. Frank was awesome as well as that other gentleman didn't catch his name. I got my service done for under 400 bucks.  Very polite, helpful im recommending this place to every one I know.  Thank you guys so much<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< date>

Ok, not 5 out of 5 because nobody told me to call ahead and get a spot on the waiting line on Saturdays... Got there, given a time around 2 hrs later and 5 of 5 for efficiency since as i come back at the specified time the task at hand got underway. So suggestion? Call ahead. Great service though.</Text>

Cedric is an awesome Barber. We are new to the area and found him highly rated on Google. Took my son in for a cut and happy I did. Now we know why celebs come to him.</Text>

Good vibe! Always showing great videos; good conversation. Cedric is masterful with the tools of the trade. He always really “gets” the style of cut I want. Once you go, you’ll keep going. Neat and clean shop.</review>

lisa is the worst orileys worker. she should be fired from that job shes at , she sent me to hub to buy a battery and told me they’ll install it for me. turns out they cant swap it out because they’re busy and short staffed . she lied and told me they’ll change it and then the nice employee called her to see why they wasted my time and their time . so when she picked up she straight up lied and said she said “oh i told him it depends on the location” she straight up lied , this isnt the first time she does this , and she gave me the wrong part 3 times in one day . someone needs to talk to her asap< /Text>

Poor customer service. Called to look up a part and Lupe answered, immediately put me on hold for over 10 minutes, she finally comes back and hangs up. When I called back I brought it to her attention that she hung up and she got mad and hung up again.</Review>

Very expensive part; almost $90.00 for a part that lists for $20-30.00 on most online parts sellers. Guess they can do that when you can't wait a few days for the part.</Text>

Well i ask for spark plugs for my vehicle and they didnt have them they have to be special ordered i ask if the main store might have those she said yes but not the ones recommended for  the vehicle i ask lupe if she could do light engine diagnostic lupe respond was they dont do that any longer but yet its posted everywhere at the entrance of them doing diagnostics if that was the case they wouldn't have those postings so i called corporate office and they say yes they do all ó reilly stores should be doing it so am not going to recommend this location since the employee at this location is lazy and gave a vogue excuse when corporate said otherwise<//review>

My truck wouldn't start and I went up to Emilio or Emiliano I believe was his name and he immediately went outside with me to go solve the problem. He said my fuel pump was going out and he showed me. He got the truck to start and I was on my way. Couldn't have thanked him enough and all he said with a smile was you're very welcome that's what we're here for. He saved me from having to call a tow truck. Awesome employees at this store. Will definitely be coming back to this store.<//Review>

Stranded in Bakersfield pulling a trailer. Loaned me tools. I bought what I thought was the right part. It wasn't. They "no-questions-asked" exchanged for the right one. Went way above the average. Thanks guys.<//Text>

I walked into the store with my two toddler daughters. One in the arms and one holding my hand. I was standing in line while ANGEL was talking on the phone. He finished his call and told me he’d help me in a moment. He finished on the computer and took another call. My daughter in my arms was already getting fussy. A customer comes and stands in line behind me. ANGEL finishes his call and tells me “let me help him first” and takes the customer behind me. I was so upset I left. He was completely rude and all I needed was to check why my engine light was on. I will never go in this store again.< /text>

From the second I walked in, one of the employees was watching me like a hawk, obviously because he thought I was going to steal something. As I was walking out because they didn't have enough of what I needed, he asks me if I found what I was looking for (after him telling me they didn't have what I needed) as he is looking me up and down trying to see any "bulges" from items I "stole". Not very cool to be profiled in a way to where I look like a thief to the rest of the customers in the store. I won't be going there again.< /text>

If I could give them 0 I would they are the most sexist place I've been to not once but twice as a female was treated like I was non existent and stupid first visit they tried to sell me something I knew was wrong i bought ut because the guy refused to listen to me then went to another orileys and got the right thing because they are not sexist and I was correct what they sold me was wrong. 2nd visit I am waiting in line and the guy behind the counter assuming I was just standing there I guess not waiting in line asked the guy who wasn't even waiting in line can i help you omfg are they serious I will NEVER COME BACK AND I HOPE NO ONE ELSE DOES EITHER< /Review>

The best thing about this store is that they beat all competitors prices by 5 percent so shop around!</Text>

From the outside it looked very unassuming. Inside they have done a nice job remodeling. The fixtures paintings, bed, bathroom and everything was new. I slept over 8 hours...phenomenal!! They brought breakfast to the room. Eggs Benedict and cappuccino. The staff was nice too. Highly recommended.< /text>

I literally cannot be more impressed by a hotel. The marble room is beautiful, and that bathroom, WOW! Huge walk in shower that has a cave-like feeling to it, and the awesome deep soaking bathtub is something I’ll have to try out next time, cause I simply didn’t have time on this most recent visit, but I am so looking forward to it. The front desk woman was so helpful and so sweet, and the complimentary breakfast was phenomenal! I don’t know how they do it! My only complaint would be that the marble room is so rarely available on hotels.com, but I can totally understand why. This place is a true hidden gem, so much so that I was reluctant to leave this review because I feel like it’s only a matter of time before this place becomes extremely expensive and impossible to book. Keep up the good work, and hopefully we’ll be seeing you all real soon!< /text>

I loved this cute little motel. It is clean and within walking distance to Embarcadero. The room was very spacious as well as the bathroom. The only downside for my husband and I was the mattress. For us it was much to hard and we were really not able to rest. Just an FYI, they don't clean your room during your stay. That was fine with us since we didn't need anything.</Review>

This is an amazing stay. We only planned one night and decided to stay for two nights. Bed is comfy and the bath tub is a great way to relax and the shower was a plus added feature.  Definitely will come back. Just a short walk to town. Enjoy the fire pit out in front on those cold nights until 10 pm.< /review>

Nice motel with a vintage boutique feel. The service was great and it included breakfast delivered to the room. Only a short walk from the Embarcadero too.</Review>

We enjoyed our stay. Everything was almost perfect. The room was large. Bathroom a little small. The sink was so tiny. Difficult not to spill water all over the floor. Mini fridge was making weird tapping and bumping noises. I kept waking up. Thinking someone was knocking on the door. You hear it more when you're sleeping. Breakfast was great. Hot and delivered right to your door. We will return in the furure.<//text>

<Text>The little beach bungalows were so awesome. We had a view of the Morro bay rock and it literally felt like we were in our own little beach cottage. The hardwood flooring and quaint little personal touches were awesome!! Must stay!!!< /Text>< Response>

< review>
I am so sad! This is the most disappointing trip I’ve ever had! The hotel had a great location but that’s about it. The beds were uncomfortable, The room is small and had a weird set up where the fridge and coffee maker were in the restroom. (Queen deluxe room) Shower sucks! The water leaked all over the bathroom floor. There was no extra blankets only extra pillows. I was looking forward to this trip for weeks and it was a complete fail! I called to ask about the bicycles that were available. Well the bicycles were complete crap. The bed was not comfortable at all! And the worst part of the entire trip! Was that I could hear literally every step, conversation and moan from the room next to us!(i wish I was Exaggerating) And they had a dog that was barking a ton, so if you are needing a quiet peaceful getaway don’t come here! I feel like I need a vacation from that vacation!  so sad! Now I have no idea when I’ll be able to take another vacation again and I feel so much worse off then when I got there.</review>

<review>Front desk service and breakfast were nice. Big complaint about thinness of walls - next door neighbors had kids playing till after 8 pm, as well as a yappy dog that barked at anything that walked by. Rooms are quite tiny. Will not be staying here again.</review>< pictures>

<review>The property was updated, very clean and nice. We loved our room and the added fireplace. Free breakfast delivered to our room was also great and delicious! Spacious shower was awesome.The only downside was our noisy neighbors that we could hear every where they walked in the room next door. Someone also decided to sing and play the guitar out at the fire pit that night.... it was quite loud. Another small downside was that parking. There were some spots on the inner part of hotel to park but otherwise it was on the street or behind the hotel where I did not want to park.Overall, while parking and loud neighbors were disappointing it is a beautiful place to stay with great amenities.< /review>< Pictures>

They are taking steps to keep people safe during this pandemic 👍 We arrived to find windows open and the ceiling fan going on high, to circulate the air.

As we were leaving, not having to visit the front desk either for check-in or check-out,  we saw that the cleaning staff were masked up and working hard.
Thank you, Beach Bungalow Inn & Suites staff!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80ece19e09b3f303:0x916e70830fd5ba60<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Stayed for NYE 2016 and had a lovely time. The Beach Bungalow is a quaint B&B. The location is awesome...only a 5min walk to the ocean front and main action. The staff was VERY nice and super friendly all the time. The included breakfast (brought to your room) each morning was a nice perk. Only con...we wish the fireplace was real. Would definitely recommend this B&B...especially since they are dog friendly!<//text>< pics>

<Review>It was clean and walking distance from the main street which was very convenient. One improvement I recommend was between the Wifi system and coverage. On my iPhone, I had to connect to Wifi every time I turned my iPhone on. I'm not sure if its iPhone related only.<//Review>< Time>

The room was spacious, nicely appointed and clean.  However, due to Covid, there was no staff at the front office.  We had no hot water when we arrived and were not able to report it, until we saw a housekeeper on our third day.  The next day, our last, the hot water appeared to have been turned off again.  There were no directions as to how to find the icemaker, which I was not able to locate until our last evening.  I later found the ice bucket in the cabinet under the bathroom sink with several ounces of red water and rust stains.<//Review>

Cute little ( I think 16 rooms total ) place to stay. Minor cosmetic damage around the room. Sadly we can not review the breakfast due to staying during the Covid 19 pandemic. A nice I little walk to shops and restaurants. Just down the street a ways is Morro Rock.. All in all a good stay.</text>

Very quaint. Rooms are small, but not too small. Breakfast is made to order and delivered to the room at 8 am...or later. A bit of traffic noise, close the window and it goes away.  Close to Morro Rock and the marina.  Super-friendly staff. Rooms are clean. Bed a bit on the hard side for some. I will certainly be back.<//Text>

I wanted to love this place so bad. It was so cute. But once we arrived it was after 6 so office was closed and our keys along with others were taped to a window!! Unsafe!..  we got inside the Marble room we first noticed the grout was gross like they never cleaned it, when we opened the mini fridge it had an nasty smell  and old food crumbs. The cups had a greasy film on them and still smelled of somones old wine...we noticed the bed comforter was covered in a sheet....hiding a giant PEE stain.
This room was not cleaned let alone covid19 clean... They would not refund us for the first night but we did get refunded for the rest of the stay and left.<//Review>

An absolutely excellent place to stay in Morro Bay. We always get one of the self catering rooms, which is roomy and sufficiently equipped to cook all.of.our meals. The living space is clean and modern. You also get a breakfast delivered to the room, which is a nice addition.  It's worth dropping by the harbor where you can get fresh fish...< /Review>

We were so excited about our last minute overnight in Morro Bay. It was the first time I had taken my children there. We chose this motel because my dear friends were staying there so we decided to join them. The room was spacious and seemed like a great value however, the great value on the room as well as my relaxed demeanor from getting away and spending quality time with my friends as well as my two children was completely overshadowed and dampened by the last 10 minutes of our stay when we returned to our room at 12:30 to retrieve our things after receiving permission for a late check out. Upon entering the room, we found that our breakfast and left over dinner from night before as well as my tea cup which had my favorite ( rather expensive) tea bag in it had all been cleared out of our room and thrown out. I am a single mother with two young  teens with big appetites. I had splurged on meals that we had planned to eat on our long trip home... over $75 worth of food and beverages. The fact that they went into our room after giving us permission to check out late and threw out our things without So much as calling us to find out if they could get a start on the cleaning was extremely invasive. To add insult to injury, $12 cash had been taken out of my purse that I had naively thought would be safe in my room while we went down to the beach. I had just looked at the bundle of cash in my purse earlier in morning. When we returned, I found the bundle of cash, however the $10 bill and 2 singles were missing from middle of bundle. Why not take the whole bundle? Too obvious I guess. Rather clever taking from middle I thought. When I asked the employees about the food, they simply shrugged shoulders and offered no apologies. Zero response to news about the missing $12. Such a disappointment to me and my children. The experience left us angry, frustrated and sad. Such a disappointment!</Review>

<review>The suite was spacious and the kitchen was fully stocked with a full size refrigerator, oven, microwave, cooking supplies, and dishes. We also loved the fireplace inside the suite and outside in the courtyard. The hotel was decorated in a fun manner and it was easy walking distance to the waterfront (the rock and sea otters) and to fun shops and great restaurants. Breakfast delivered to the room every morning was an extra treat!</review>< pictures>

<Rating>None</Rating><text>Nicely kept up. Difficult times to stay at any hotel property. We had to buy some supplies i.e. coffee and paper products. However, room was clean, and we were given starter supplies for one night's stay. Rooms are close together, so noises from neighbors were quite audible. Crowded times at coastal properties, street noises, etc.<//text>< Time>

<Review>This is the cutest inn. We stayed in the Pacific room with our two kids. So spacious and clean. It was perfect: a fireplace heater, big comfy beds, a roomy shower with hot water that stayed hot, and the breakfast was amazing: Bagels with lox and capers, vegan granola, and Belgium waffles for the kids. We walked to Top Dog coffee and other nearby shops and places to eat. So much fun! My son wants to go back to MB and stay there for his birthday. Thanks for helping us to have a wonderful trip, Beach Bungalow.<//Review><Name>Jaclyn Walker</Name>< gmap_id>

<review>This was our fourth visit to Morro Bay and first stay at Beach Bungalow Inn and Suites. We were so impressed with the property and our room. The room was super comfortable and clean, and the decor was beach themed. Fireplace in the room added to the coziness. Complimentary breakfast was delicious, and was brought to our room which was a very nice touch. We will be back!</review>< userid>

Recent redo and they did a fair job.  If it was in Santa Monica or Beverly Hills it would get extra stars.
My wife and I really enjoyed our stay here and plan to use this place again.
You should too. It's convenient, centrally located, quiet and a friendly, helpful staff.  They did and do the extra mile.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Cute place! Colorful outside bungalows, comfy chairs and outside fire pits add a nice touch. Tip of Mirro Rock is visible in foreground. Friendly staff. Breakfast was hand delivered to our room and was DELICIOUS! Inside the bungalow are "fresh open" windows, a faux fireplace, and mini fridge. The room "feels" spacious. Plenty of outlets for charging devices. Beds and pillows were comfy. There is a journal for guests to pen their thoughts.

BUT...parking is "first come, first served" so it can be challenging if you pull in late. The toilet seat in our room (Dunes) was too low for these arthritic knees, there were no shower safety bars and poor drainage in the shower. There were long black hairs on the bathroom floor and one in the fridge (I just calmly grabbed some tissues and disposed of them...)

Overall, though, a pleasant stay!😎<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Was pleasantly surprised by everything about this charming spot in Morrow Bay! Everything about our stay here exceeded my expectations in every way. The quality of the rooms was definitely higher than I would have expected for a property at this price point. Our rooms had beautiful hardwood floors, crown molding, and a nicely done bathroom. It's clear that this property has been remodeled recently!

On top of the great room, the location and amenities are wonderful as well. Included in the booking is a hot breakfast with coffee which was actually quite good! There is also some nice little seating areas out in front of the rooms and while it isn't the ideal setting, it's a nice spot to enjoy a coffee and plan your day. To top it off, the Beach Bungalow is just a couple blocks from the beach, and a short walk to downtown and the pier.

The Beach Bungalow isn't the Ritz, but for what you get here, it is an amazing value and we will definitely be returning in the future<//text>

Very nice, clean, and comfortable. Super easy to find, located just a few blocks from the wharf. The best part was the cooked to order breakfast! I was hoping to keep this place a secret for my occasional getaways, but I'm sure word will get out about what a great place it is. 😊<//text>

My husband and I went for our anniversary. This was our second stay, our first was our honeymoon 4 years earlier. We love this hotel! They were so nice and went above and beyond to make our stay even better this time around. They have beautiful rooms that can accommodate any type of room needed and are close to the water. They bring breakfast to your room every morning and it is delicious. We recommend this establishment to everyone we know!</review>

The blue butterfly room is perfect for families, two rooms and no rooms on either side so rambunctious kids (like ours) won't bug other guests. The breakfast in bed is a great touch with yummy coffee.  The only ding is that we had to unplug the mini fridge because it was so loud.</Review><GmapID>0x80ece19e09b3f303:0x916e70830fd5ba60< /GmapID><UserId.>110398069718340999206<//UserId.>< rating>

Service was nice, breakfast was pretty good. Not a lot of food,  but enough if you are not a big eater. In room coffee not great, but coffee with breakfast was good. Cappuccino and espresso. There was no microwave in the room we stayed in (Pacific) which was a real inconvience. Seating area out front was a nice place to sit and look at Morro rock.</text>

Beach Bungalow is awesome! Me and my wife went three years ago for our honeymoon. We came back this year for our four year anniversary. They upgraded us to the king suite and it was wonderful. The breakfast in bed was awesome and I have never had a place do that as part of the room. We definitely will be back in the future!< /review>

The Beach Bungalow Inn & Suites was a great experience. This is an older, small property (probably about 20 guest rooms) with doors that are accessed from outside. It definitely has a California feel with red clay tile roof and Caribbean colors. The location is ideal for exploring Morro Bay as the waterfront area is within two blocks or so. The check-in staff was friendly; Anna is a delight and informative with local restaurant tips. The room was not large but had been nicely updated with tastefully fashionable pieces. I'd call the style Restoration Hardware knock-off with a beach flair. The floors are wood and there's lots of updated tile in the bathrooms. Neither the furnishing nor the decor are luxury but they are very nicely done, new, trendy and comfortable. The room was clean and the bed was adorned with white sheets and comfortable. The wifi was spotty. There are several different network names and we found ourselves having to switch between them when the signal would drop. There was a complimentary breakfast in the morning brought to your room. Guest order this off their menu the day before. Although not a large meal, it was really well done and a delightful surprise. I highly recommend the Beach Bungalow Inn & Suites!</text>

<text>My wife and I really enjoyed staying here. It was within easy walking distance to shops and the waterfront. The staff were very kind and more than willing to help out with any questions we had about our room. The room was amazing. Easy instructions on how to use the fireplace in the room. Beautiful room! They had a firepit on site with chairs you could use at night in the common area in front of the rooms. Breakfast was delicious. It was so nice having breakfast in the morning brought to the room because we could just take our time getting up in the morning. We will definitely be coming back.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80ece19e09b3f303:0x916e70830fd5ba60< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We had a great time at Beach Bungalow Inn. Fun to walk to the Embarcadero, everything was close. When we arrived it was almost sunset and the owner encouraged us to hurry down to to the water see the amazing sunset. Fabulous. Morro Bay is a very pet friendly town. We took our little pup everywhere.The breakfast served in our room was yummy, just add butter and jam and it would be perfect.  We would stay here again. Great location.</review>

We ended up booking a queen bed room the night before and stayed for one night. My wife and I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and bicycles, which we took to explore the small town. The service was great and the lady who checked us in was helpful in getting to know the area. The breakfast wasn't amazing but was glad they delivered it you I the morning. The bikes were two beach cruisers that seen better days. They seemed to have been maintained and couldn't complain since they did the job and had working brakes. The only complaint was the thin walls, which we realized 3 in the morning when our neighbors were a bit loud. There was quite a bit of street noise from cars passing by our window. Bring earplugs. The location was great, being a 5 minute walk to the local shops and beach.<//text>

Worst place I've ever stayed at by the beach -SERIOUSLY. Called ahead to get flowers and chocolates prepared ahead of time in our room. Also requested the handicapped room for the bigger bathroom & was told that it was no problem. But when we arrived they gave us a different room (and we checked -they gave our original requested room to some healthy teenagers that checked in after us). No chocolates or flowers in the room at all either. Not only that, but there was BLACK MOLD all over in the shower. Some one came and cleaned it, but then we had the smell of bleach for the rest of the weekend in our room. The toilet paper was so thin it would break even after you layer 6 pieces together too. Not to mention that the ceiling fan blades are so low that the blades were only a couple inches away from my head & the TV was mounted in a spot that it was near impossible to watch from the bed. The fire pit outside was nice, but it must automatically shut off at a certain hour because about 2 minutes after we went out there to enjoy it, it shut off. And walking around the property, there were old used toilets that they were storing outside by the ice machine. I seriously don't understand all these 5 star reviews on here. For $200 a night, I expect A LOT better. We went and looked at the Best Western down the street after we left, and it looked WAY better than this dump. Next time, I'm staying there.<//text>

Overall, a small, quiet, older bungalow style hotel a couple blocks inland from the coastal main drag. Easy check-in and specious rooms. Little chilly at night (heat supplied from a gas fireplace). Breakfast was included and it was honestly, the best complimentary breakfast I've had at a hotel. Ever.

Definitely consider spending a night or two here.< /text>< Pictures>

We were sent here by another hotel that had messed up our booking. Friendly staff - showed us two rooms, so we could choose. Unfortunately, we chose the Estero Room. The decor is simple and the room was clean, but the floors vibrate in this room, and we could feel the vibration in the bed mattress. Not great for sleeping! There is a bit of street noise and the mini fridge is noisy, too. No views except for the rooms that face the street. Breakfast delivered to your door, and rooms have gas fireplaces, which is a nice touch.<//Review>

It's an overrated hotel. I seldom give review less than 4 stars. This is one.
The pros are
1) complimentary room service breakfast
2) fancy wall mount heater with panel screen mimic fireplace that impressed me when I walked in.
3) the first eye impression is great when I walked in my hotel room

The cons are
1) pay at reservations without refund,
2) only several parking space in hotel complex, many need to park on nearby street.
3) The fatal part is the comforter is very thin and the wall mount heater is weak that kept on freezing me up in first 2 hours of sleep. Eventually I put on all my clothes to sleep.
4) Another part is the shower room has no place to put shampoo etc
5) The shower water can easily flow out of shower room to bathroom due to almost flat barrier between shower room and bathroom.<//review>

Rooms are nice and room service breakfast is quite good. However rooms are very cold, the only heat source is a small gas fireplace under the TV. If it's below 50 outside I wouldn't recommend it.< /review>

The breakfast was delicious (crepes with fruit and whipcream rocked) and delivered to the room in the morning. It's a few minutes walk to the boardwalk shopping area. Would definitely stay again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80ece19e09b3f303:0x916e70830fd5ba60<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

They had a regular room available but they wanted $60.00 more,  we decided that for one night it wasn't worth it.

Because the handicap-shower floor is leveled with the rest of the bathroom the whole bathroom got flooded while I showered.  My husband went to the office to get extra towels to soak up the water  only to find out that there was no one there.

There was also a clause of no cancelation in our rental agreement!<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
We booked this hotel for one night for a stop while on our way down Hwy1 to Los Angeles. We arrived after their office hours, but all we needed to get to our room was prepared for us. We were traveling with our little daughter, so we asked for a baby bed weeks in advance, which had been confirmed by ther Hotel. However, upon arrival, the baby bed wasn't there. But: I immediately called the manager, told him about the bed, and ten minutes later he arrived and got the bed from their storage. Great service.
The room was clean and huge enough for the baby bed and our luggage. The fire place looked romantic, we didn't need it though since it was warm enough even without it.
Breakfast is offered via form, which is dropped off at their office. You can choose between several breakfast options, we had the "bircher muesli" and a bagel, which was uncommon but very tasty. The breakfast is brought to your room at the time you chose on the ordering form.

The place in general was neat and clean, the atmosphere relaxed. The Hotel is located conveniently not too far away from the highway, and also close to shopping, grocery and the town's harbor area. All staff members we met were very friendly and accomodating. Even though we didn't spend too much time there, we enjoyed our short stop and would book again should we ever happen to be in that area again.< /Review>

My wife and I recently stayed at the Beach Bungalow during a trip up PCH from Newport Beach to Big Sur. The Beach Bungalow was a perfect place to rest in between our Santa Barbara and Big Sur stops. The rooms were very well done with very high quality bedding and furniture. The place maintains the humble characteristics of a beach bungalow in an old fishing town. Though, like the town itself, has brought in simple yet "beach-sophisticated" quality nuances in its upgrades and feel. John and Anna were perfect hosts and spent time providing useful recommendations for a truly local stay. They even air mailed my glasses free after I forgot them in the room.<//Review>

People were banging on our door all night. At one point we thought they were going to break the door down. Nobody was at the office to reach out too. This was from 2am till around 5am.  Worst experience I’ve ever had at a hotel.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Nice place to stay in Morro Bay. Down to the harbor are just 5 minutes walk and in the immediate area are nice restaurants and bars, although at first it makes the impression as if there were only residential buildings. All in all, we were very happy, the staff was super friendly and accommodating. We would definitely come again.

(Original)
Schöne Übernachtungsmöglichkeit in Morro Bay. Runter zum Hafen sind gerade mal 5 Minuten zu Fuß und in der unmittelbaren Umgebung sind eine nette Restaurants und Bars, obwohl es zuerst mal den Eindruck macht als wären da nur Wohnhäuser. Alles in allem waren wir sehr zufrieden, das Personal war super freundlich und zuvorkommend. Wir würden auf jeden Fall noch mal herkommen.</review>

Der CheckIn nach 18 Uhr klappte problemlos. Die Zimmer tragen individuelle Namen und sind sehr niedlich eingerichtet. Leider war unser Bett sehr durchgelegen, was unsere Nacht etwas schlaflos machte. Dennoch waren wir sehr angetan von dem erkennbaren persönlichen Stil der Betreiber. So lag auf dem Bett ein kleines Gästebüchlein, in welchem man einen Gruß hinterlassen konnte. Auch das angebotene Frühstück ist wirklich mal etwas ganz anderes. Beim CheckIn erhält man einen Zettel, auf dem man ankreuzen kann, was man gern essen möchte. Die Auswahl ist super, allerdings kann man sich nur eine Sache pro Person aussuchen, was für ein Frühstück sehr wenig ist - entweder Jogurt mit Müsli oder belegter Bagel oder Omelett. Dafür war es sehr lecker und wird frisch zubereitet ans Zimmer gebracht. Auch der Kaffee war sehr gut! Parkplätze sind vorhanden, allerdings muss man frühzeitig da sein, um noch einen Platz auf dem hoteleigenen Gelände zu finden. Dafür kann man in der Umgebung problemlos parken.</Text>

Trotz später Anreise unkomplizierter Check-In nach kurzer telefonischer Absprache. Das Zimmer (Oyster) war Richtung Strand ausgerichtet. Top! Modern und liebevoll eingerichtet. Alles in einem sehr guten & sauberen Zustand. Unser Zimmer hatte sogar einen gasbetriebenen Kamin. Sehr schön. Morgens hörten wir die Seehunde am Pier, da unsere Fenster im Richtung Strand ausgerichtet waren. War absolut entspannt! Das am Vorabend bestellte Frühstück wurde uns pünktlich auf das Zimmer gebracht. Sehr guter und freundlicher Service! Das war unser bestes Motel auf unsere Rundreise an der Westküste Kaliforniens. Top Preis- Leistungsverhältnis im Vergleich zu anderen Motels, die wir besucht hatten! Wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen!</review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>They offer medical transportation, but the company they do business with in Tehachapi is THE WORST. Lucky Services has cancelled previously arranged and confirmed rides for medical appointments three times in a row. They cancel at the last minute, without notice or time to rebook a doctors appointment and do not bother to contact the client. The only way you find out is by calling them to confirm they are picking you up. These are not rides to a salon, they are medically necessary procedures, peoples lives are involved. DO NOT PATRONIZE LUCKY SERVICES. STAY AWAY. THEY NEED TO LEARN TO NOT JERK PEOPLE AROUND.< /review>< user_id>

Today was the third time I had occasion to call Kern Families and like the first two, the service was OUTSTANDING!  I couldn't have asked for more.  I spoke with Cheyenne P today.   It was almost 5:pm when I called with a bad situation I needed help on.  Cheyenne was great, took care of every issue, going above and beyond my expectations.  And, worth mentioning, her attitude getting my call at the end of the day was great.  It was more like someone at the start of her shift, not the end. She gave me all the time I needed and resolved the issues on one call.  Thank you Kern Families and thank you Cheyenne.  God Bless.< /Text>

<review>THEY DON'T EVEN DESERVE THAT ONE STAR. KFHC STAFF AND THEIR DOCTORS SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO DEAL WITH ANY PUBLIC SETTING, ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING WITH A PERSON'S WELL BEING. ALSO KERN FAMILY HEALTH CARE-MEDICIAL TRANSPORTATION IS A JOKE AND A BIG WASTE OF TIME. THEY PUT YOU ON HOLD FOR HOURS, FINALLY WHEN YOU GET THROUGH, THEY TALK DOWN TO YOU, AND PUT YOU ON HOLD AGAIN TO CONFIRM THE AUTHORIZATION WITH THE MEMBERSHIP DEPARTMENT, WHERE THEY COME BACK ON THE PHONE, ONLY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE MEMBERSHIP DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY CLOSED AND TO TRY AGAIN TOMORROW. THAT IS IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH, SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK ONLY TO HANG UP THE PHONE ON YOU. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY, BY SOME REP NAME MIRANDA, WHO I AM SURE THEY HIRED OFF THE STREET AND KNOWS ZILCH ABOUT WORKING AND DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC!!!!!< /review>< Resp>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>This is a horrible company. I just moved from Maryland where I was on Medcaid, and they are trying to redesign all my prescriptions that I have been on for years. It wont work because I have legal insurance and will file an Independent Medical Review against them, and a complaint with the Dept of Managed Care. However, this is a horrible MCO that is giving substandard care to Medical-Medicaid patients. They refused to fill a medication that causes seizures if I stop takeing it suddenly... MCOs should be illegal in general. Only in the United States would plans like this be allowed exist. They also have the most restrictive drug forumulary that I have ever seen in my life, and I have seen many. I could not even get a 35.00 dollar GENERIC medication that has been out for years filled, that I have been takeing for years, without a Prior Auth/TAR (the cost to them for this generic would have been 35.00 dollars). Most for-profit Medical MCO's are more generous then this, and I hate for-profit MCO's (but they have this horrible medically life threatening company beat). IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, STAY AWAY.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The transportation department is very rude. And the employee by the name “Danica” is a smart mouth on the phone, just because of the kind of insurance it is seems like people will look down on you for having it won’t waist my time with them anymore.<//review>

<text>Kern Family Health Care is, without a single doubt, the absolute worst healthcare insurance company I have ever dealt with, and I work with different payers from coast to coast. It's not only a terrible experience on the patient side (as the other reviews will tell you), but they are completely obstructive on the provider side of things as well. I work for a physician's office and we battle every month with Kern to get simple things like hospital visits paid. Good luck trying to reach their Claims Dept. at the 1-800 number; no one ever answers. Their Claims Dispute process is a total joke and they are never processed on time (if they are even received at all!).</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Unfortunately I am a low income mother and can't afford to pay for medical insurance and I am stuck with KFHC. I'm so glad I chose Health Net for my son's medical choice because although he doesn't have the medical issues I have, we have never had a single problem getting him the basic needs. I lost my job due to a medical issue and it was done in such a way to cover up disability discrimination and that also puts me a tight position with finances and unable to afford things like medication that I NEED on a monthly basis and can be very dangerous to come off cold turkey. Well KFHC has made it an uphill battle to get ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. If you have a choice I urge you to NOT go with KFHC AT ALL! They make you jump through all their hoops and then still deny everything for bogus reasons. I have had a debilitating pain problem for the last 5 years and I can't even get an MRI approved after doing exactly what they have asked in accordance to their "rules" and order of doing things. I'm ready to switch to a different provider and start my search for treatment over because they have not helped me in any way and have only caused me stress and worsening pain.
My fiancee also has KFHC and has had the same battle to get proper medical care. They won't approve medication after a hospital stay due to mental illness, even after 2 doctors prescribed it and submitted the information they asked for. They treat everyone like drug-seeking drug abusers and never want to cover anything.<//text>

< Review>
Nice spot with picnic tables and plenty of rocks to climb. The only thing is there was no shade by the tables. You have to find a shady spot between the rocks. The oak tree itself is probably the best shady spot there. Just head down the dirt road to the right once you turn off the main road and go all the way to the turnaround at the end. You can't miss it.<//Review>

<Review>Love this spot! Went here last month with my eight year old son and we had a blast exploring the area and climbing the rocks. Joshua Tree is truly a magical place, I can't believe I had never stopped at the Live Oak Picnic Area before!</Review><user_id>112016054045742868879< /user_id>< Time>

Lovely spot. I wouldn't go in summer I imagine it gets brutal as there is no reprieve from the shade. But other seasons it's very peaceful.< /text>

This is a pretty good camping area. Cool rock formations nearby to climb on. There is a grill but no fire pit though.</Review>

I visited CVS Pharmacy, to pick up some makeup for my daughter.  They have the best collection for eyelash glue. She found a brand that she loves,  they carry it and we haven't been able to find it anywhere else!!  They always have open parking spaces in front of the business, which is very convenient.
From time to time they have good sales on products that I use. So there's a nice  reason to visit from time to time. The only negative thing about the small strip mall is,  the parking lot and entrances. They need to be repaired and taken proper care of.< /Text>

This Plaza has a CVS 24 hour drug store. A clothing store for men, women and kids at good prices. It's not the Miller's Outpost it used to be, but it has affordable prices. The sub machine is one of the best in the entire Antelope Valley. The Asian restaurant I have had food poisoning from. Of course the Asian restaurant has changed hands numerous times. The monster Donuts has the most outrageous prices of any donut store in Southern California.

What you get is a fancy donut with Churros or M&M's on top or even gummy bears. Three to four times a prize as a common donut without the fancy garbage on top.

It is nice to have the only 24 hour drug store in town here. Other than that the best thing about this mall is there are hardly any panhandlers in the parking lot, compared to other places and plazas.< /text>

Lots of choices for shopping needs.   CVS, DD's ; decent prices for clothing, purses, and household items. Busy times are usually 1-10 of each month. Optometrist: Dr. Steven Israel, going there for years.. highly recommend. hallmark store, lots of gift choices, glad we have one in our neighborhood. Sandwich shop, Chinese food, across the street and many food choices, as well.  Goodwill across the street, all four corners of this intersection have a lot of shopping, food, etc choices.<//review>

I don't think I'm the right person to be reviewing this.  I have never had a. Shopping center ask for a review.  DD's discounts is fun and the CVS is 24 hours and it's not a bad area to have to go to shop if you find your in need of something at 3am.< /Review>

Pretty decent little shopping center with a great sub shop and one of the few 24 hour pharmacies in town.

Nearby freeway access, too.<//Review>
