the sushi was so filling and the portions are quite big. they have a good variety of rolls and the fish was pretty fresh. there’s a little wait time right now because of covid and the location is actually very small!</Review>

Out of $125 worth of sushi 2  rolls were actually good. They charge for sauce and don't tell you. I've never been to a sushi place that charges for siracha. That is crazy! We were missing a roll and didn't even want to deal with the staff to fix it. I'd go to Ralph's for sushi before I ever went back here.</text>

In our opinion it's the best Sushi restaurant in the city. We absolutely love the steamed muscles, squid large, the home run roll, their seaweed salad and many more items on the menu.

Well food is pretty good but the service from this one guy who works the counter during covid is the worst impatient rude worker I have ever experienced.And I’m in the food service business.If he treated my customers how he treated us tonight I would fire him on the spot.Also this is not the first time.We like the food but this guy is so bad we won’t be back!!Covid has been bad to all restaurants but we will go somewhere that doesn’t involve eye rolling,talking to other crew in his language complaining about us.He is awful!!!< /Review>

<Review>Love their Mr Tommy and Hole In One rolls, so good, must try. I recently tried their rice-less rolls (Four Seasons & Cherry Blossom) and I'm in love all over again. A perfect way to get my sushi fix when I'm on a low carb diet or just any 'ol time!!!<//Review>< Pics>

Their staff is very friendly, skilled and responsive!!! We were so pleased with the job that the technician did on our ducts.  He was courteous, professional, and so patient with our nosy dog who kept poking his head in the way. Thanks.</Review>

Great food. Parking is very minimal.  If you don't score a parking spot by the restaurant be prepared to walk.<//Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>The food here is great, but the service we received was terrible. We ordered the Garlic edamame, Touchdown Roll (tempura shrimp, assorted seafood, eel sauce, tempura bits), and Happy Roll (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, eel). All of these were delicious! But sadly that's about all the good there was. Terrible service seemed to be the theme of the night. We of the 3 groups of 2 that we're waiting, the wait staff pulled the newest group to be seated. When the hostess was notified she looked frustrated and apologized for that, but didn't do much else for the remaining 2 groups left. When we were seated it took a bit before we were able to even place a drink let alone food order. While waiting it was evident that all the tables around us had orders that were forgotten or missed.  The table that seemed to have been there the longest had at least 3 things they ordered but never came.

Despite the service, I will give this place another shot on a different day, if only for that garlic edamame.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Good food. Fast servers. No bad smell that sticks on your clothing. As usual ,services in the Bar is faster than the Tables. Noisy on Friday nights. Table in the far-left corner is the noisiest location due to the low-ceiling, mirrored back wall and the sound seemed to  get directed to that corner. Offers good prices during Happy Hour. Parking might be a challenge at night.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Great food but mediocre service. I have been here twice. I love the food and the menu varieties. This time the waiter completely ignored me or forgot to enter my order in the computer. I waited and waited and waited and waited. Even my little son was complaining. I see people that just got seated being served before me. Had to call the Manager. She handled it in a very professional manner and waived the cost of my appitizer. Probably may want to seat in the bar the next time just to avoid something like this to ever happen.</review>< Pics>

We ate at sushi planet on Friday. We ordered 2 different types of sushi rolls and blue fin tuna from the specials board. Very pricey and it was a long wait even though the restaurant was half full. On the positive side, everything was really fresh and the wasabi was decent.< /review>

<Time>1601573383636< /Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>I came out to Lathrop for my husband's work trip & I came across this place. In excitement I  went there at night one day, I was greeted with a nice lady but she had told me I would have to place an order before I came out, I was so disappointed because I was leaving the next day. Something in the universe wanted me to try this place because we we're asked to come back out for work the following week! This time I went during the day & I was greeted with a younger lady who happened to be the pastry chef for the vegan options. I had the best conversation with her about the whole family becoming vegan for health issues and how they added the vegan options, she took a gamble at trying to sell vegan items and I'm so glad she did they tasted just like when I was a kid but animal free. Please visit this place if your in town or passing through.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO0zIVq8pVmDEhHJMWKwFx5tPLYr2oeSpV-7M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

(Translated by Google) I ordered a 3-milk cake with fruit and they gave it to me only with some strawberries and canned pineapple, the filling was ordered with vanilla and they made it with strawberry, that was almost falling apart, among other things.
It is the first time I have ordered a cake in that place and it will be the last.

Ordene un pastel de 3 leches con frutas y me lo dieron solo con unas fresas y piña de lata, el relleno lo ordene de vainilla y me lo hicieron de fresa, casi se estaba callendo eso entre otras cosas.

If you look crazy socks than this is your place, I got some socks myself and I wear them as often as I can. The choices of socks can range from rainbow thigh highs to kids socks to attitude crew socks from different brands. The employees are friendly as the enjoy the socks too and they do sell leggings and tights as well.< /review>

Love the selections here.  So many cute and funny socks!  And they are one of the only places I know of that sells toe socks, and that is important because my other half solely (pun intended) wears toe shoes.<//Text>

<Text>Just go here!! You will understand. And probably stay for 30 minutes wondering how you ever lived without this place and ever wore such boring socks that were not from this awesome store. You will also be compelled to spread the joy and buy socks for friends/family cuz they are so much fun to wear!-:)< /Text><gmapID>0x8085875233083e29:0x13fb056759d01c21<//gmapID>< name>

Super cute and well organized Sockshop has something for everyone - men, women and kids.  Average price for a pair of novelty socks seems to be about $12.   They have a nice selection of sale items as well.

Primarily novelty socks, but they carry many color ways and styles.  Staff is very nice here and eager to help. Browsing is welcome!</Text>

<text>Fantastic selection including MOD, Gumball Poodle, Sock-It-To-Me, and many more.

For the brands that I know, the prices were a bit higher than online, but these guys have much higher overhead.

Be sure to check out the bargain bin.

Can't comment on the staff because they never engaged us during the considerable time that we were in the store. And thats why we walked out empty-handed!</text><time>1529300166723<//time>< user_id>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>There are so many stores on Haight Street; smoke shops to vintage clothing stores and eateries, but only a few are so specialized as the Sockshop on Haight. Even if you wear the most boring socks in the world, you will spend at least a few entertaining minutes in here. You'll find almost everything from floral thigh-highs to sheer ankle-freezers, simple patterns to novelty Albert Einstein portraits and a variety of leggings and tights. And even better; they're reasonably priced! With most pairs under $10, you're likely going to walk away with something you really like, without feeling like you've dented your wallet.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

I was looking for organic cotton socks without spandex but found nothing like that here. When I asked the staff they seemed bored and indifferent at my inquiry. What I found was colorful socks with many themes probably suitable for tourist but not for one really shopping for essential footwear. Material of socks were the typical cotton polyester blends found for half the price at Target or Walmart.<//Text>

The name explains what type of merchandise they sell. It doesn't tell you about the awesome selection that they have! I got a couple pairs of super fun dinosaur socks from them and a giraffe pair. (I happen to love both dinosaurs and giraffes.)
It's a really fun place to pick up unique items for gifts. They do sell more than just socks, but you really only go here if you're looking for some socks that will tell whoever you're buying them for that you know they are weird and you love them anyway!< /Text>

If you are looking for a funky new pair of socks this is the place to go--it has every sock you could ever need. I have never purchased a pair of socks here for myself, only as gifts, but I will say it is a lot of fun to look around. There are socks you would never have imagined existed--definitely worth popping in while you're walking down Haight Street.</Review>

I only buy socks here occasionally, because they are expensive, brand name type socks. It is conveniently located, however, if I have a particular kind of sock in mind, such as hiking. The socks are colorful and nice, but I think they could work on their tights line.< /text>

What can I say it's is filled with socks of different shapes, sizes and designs. A little expensive, from what I saw a pair of socks could cost from $8 up.</review>

Aksed them over the if they can exchange socks I bought earlier. They said yes.
Got to their store where they told me they can't do it.
Thanks for waisting my time.< /text>

<text>Worst experience ever. Had 2 packages to send. One got sent. Gave me problems about mailing label on other. Couldn't scan. Told me there was nothing she could do. I told her she could type in tracking #. Said it wouldn't work. Wouldn't even try. The manager was even worse trying to deal with. Not the UPS STORE to go to. Just find another one. (Update) 20 minutes later I'm at another location. Teller tried to scan. Had problems. Said no problem.  Typed in tracking #. Wouldn't you know it worked. Got my reciept and was on my way. Oakland store much better service. And professional employees.</text><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

I wish I could give this UPS Store location zero stars. The customer experience here was a total disaster when I visited with my family. First, the UPS woman who "helped" us was very rude and condescending. Rather than doing her job efficiently she decided to be rude to my wife and provide no instructions on their notary process. This location is an absolute joke along with their terrible service as evident by other reviewers.  Do yourself a favor and do not go to this location if quality customer service is important to you.<//Text>

Super rude employee denied to take an amazon return because it was a big box and she didn't want to deal with it. Went to the other ups store in Alameda and had a wonderful experience :)<//text>

Their system has been "down" the last two times I came here to ship a package. What's the point of having a shipping store if it can never ship. They also don't accept usps drop off like most ups stores. The supervisor always seems to have an answer for why they cant help you. "We're done with that service for today, the system is down, we don't do that right now because of covid". 3/4 of customers end up leaving without having their needs addressed.< /review>

<Review>I've had a mailbox here for the last year.  It has been the worst service and management.  They don't tell you things up front when you are signing up for servicse like that they can't forward your packages only envelopes.  I opened a box and have a sol prop LLC and they also didn't tell me that they would return to sender anything that had my LLC and not my name.  Their staff doesn't care about customers.  They don't tell you all the truth. When I address these things "I should have been told" but I wasn't and there is no solve.  I had one person that was helpful from this store and she told me she was actually from another store. DON'T USE SERVICES HERE.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>The worst experience at any place of business in my life! The most unprofessional rude self entitled manager (Erika)  I have ever encountered at the UPS Store #0578 I have filed a theft report with the police. My 2,000 dollar drone package was delivered to this location and signed for by a UPS store employee. The mailbox number got cutoff on the delivery address. It was delivered by USPS and was handed in person to an employee at this location AND SIGNED FOR! The manger said they do not have it and cannot tell me who signed for it or where this package magically disappeared. The cooperate customer service number is a joke and never connects to anyone and doesn’t even give you an option to report theft! NEVER GO THERE. Erika needs to be fired!</Review>< user_name>

< review>
Man am I sorry I didn't read the review before I took my business there. I had THE MOST abusive encounter I suspect is Erika from the other eviews. She is white with what appeared to be homemade tattoos on her hands. The nastiest human I've ever experienced after paying $100 for stamps and shredding - and I'm disabled! Erika needs to be fired!!! they had trouble faxing a document, because they didn't dial one before the 800 number. I went to the store at Blanding - what a difference, they COULD fax and were very polite & professional. I only wish I would have had Marina Village store to cancel and refund my transaction. NEVER AGAIN - DON'T GO, tell all your friends! Owners need to PAY attention to these reviews!!!!!!!!!!! I'll be calling corporate.< /review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>I've been here multiple times and there is often a wait. This UPS store is much less efficient than other stores i have been to. I was returning an Amazon purchase that I was clearly instructed to not pack. This store tried to tell me they had to pack it and wanted to charge me $15 for a box and to pack it. Some excess training may be needed in this location.</text>< Pics>

I had an Amazon package to return. They asked 5$ to print the return label, something FedEx does for free. And during all the transaction they seemed annoyed by my presence. I will never go back<//review>

Very rude and unprofessional manager who talks so rude to customers i was there today and swore never to go there again one employee asked the manager a simple question if she could make a copy of a notorized document and the manager answered in the presence of other customers “No she can use it to steal with other documents” i told her that is not the way to address she could at least say “No please is not allowed “ she was rude and doesn’t give you one minute to explain anything as if they are offering free services yet we are paying very expensive 😡😡😡😡< /Review>

Rude lady working the counter today 11/09 refused to assist me, told me there was a charge for everything, meanwhile I had labels. Then after saying it was fine to pay to print another label, she tells me my package is too large to ship here. Rude, waste of time and space. Use the UPS hub in Oakland and avoid these rude people at all costs!!

Now I’m stuck on hold with UPS for OVER 30 MINUTES I AM NEVER DOING BUSINESS WITH UPS AGAIN</review>

<Review>I've had nothing but great service from this store. In particular, Erika has been amazing. We have a mailbox here and have all of our packages delivered here. They always greet us when we come in and have everything ready for us. I've had a couple of things notarized here, and that's been easy as well. I'm not sure why people are leaving negative reviews. It's a service business, and there will always be people that are disgruntled, but they need to separate not liking the rules from dumping on the employees. The ladies here are absolutely the best.</Review>< userid>

Went for Notary once I got there I had the wrong page to notarized... so had to go back home get correct page... I drove back walked up seen the lady who had helped me out before... she literally ran to the back when she saw me coming.. walked in the store the other girl who was working said sorry she’s on lunch and we have been swamped.. mind you no one was in the store at that time... very unprofessional and not good customer service.. will never go there again.. I end up finding a private notary went much smoother and professional< /Review>

<review>Came in to mail a return and have a document notarized.  Erika, the store manager, was quite possibly one of the rudest, most demeaning personalities I have ever come across in a customer-facing position. I understand that sometimes people have bad days, and generally try to give people the benefit of the doubt. We all lash out sometimes. But after reading other reviews, I was compelled to share my experience as well. Why is this person involved in any kind of customer service, let alone management? Is it really expecting that much to be treated with basic human respwct? I will never take my business here again< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

wish I saw the rating prior.  We had a customer ship to this store for  a thank you to a group of nurses that are working nearby and staying in an AirBnb while they are on the front lines of this pandemic.  When she called to check on status, they very rudely said that they don't accept UPS packages unless you own a box. Having never heard of this before, we called and were informed that they WOULD accept it but there would be a fee for holding. So we shipped.  We were then notified that the package was refused. When we called, the manager was very abrupt and said "It's my store- my rules!" When we asked why we were told that there would be a fee to hold it the previous day, she replied, "No idea who said that, but my store my rules."  and hung up. We have never had an issue shipping to any UPS store in the past - how do you call yourself a UPS store if you do not accept UPS packages?</review>

<text>I called at 1130am asking if they did ink finger printing. They said yes come before 4pm. I’m here at 1215pm, now they are telling me to come back between 2-5 because she’s going on lunch. No surprise this place has terrible reviews. Such an unprofessional staff. Ups really needs to work on this location as soon as possible. The women there need supervision, as they seem fairly incapable of maintaining a positive image and a healthy running business.< /text>< pics>

I was a customer and boxholder here for three years, and I wish I could go back and use USPS or a different UPS store instead.

Boxes here are 500 per year, compared to less than 300 at other UPS stores.

Further, when I finally tried to cancel my mailbox the manager rudely lied to my face, and claimed that there was no forwarding clause in the contract (it's section 6, and available on the website).   They insisted I fully pay for 6 more months of mailbox service, instead of the nominal "postage, packaging material, and forwarding fees" stated in the contract.

I've sought remediation, and suggest you avoid this store altogether.

There's a Fedex around the corner, a USPS up Webster Street, and another UPS store in Alameda.     Just beware of this ripoff store.< /review>

This place is terrible. I called 10 minutes before going there to confirm they could sell me a box to ship my items in and then when I drove there they told me they don't sell boxes. Also the manager lady here was being very rude and short with literally every customer in the store. She kept interrupting the other employees who were trying to help customers and was being rude to the employees as well<//Text>

<Review>Great store, great service!  The people in the store are great - quick and professional. The store is often busy, but they are very good a getting you and out with smile. (Not sure why there are so many bad reviews on this place - it is soooo much quicker and more professional than the USPO. There is new management now, maybe that is the issue.)< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Went to get some documents notarized, employee informed us they would not for the entire day because they were "too busy" and to check back the next day. There was only one other customer in the store and we were willing to wait.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f80d6a205029b:0x2f159db592989794< /Gmap_id></record>

Staff is very rude. Especially the gal in charge, there. I was refused service there, for no legitimate reason.<//review>

I have been waiting for fifteen minutes just to print out one piece if paper for work. This is sad, the guy just walks up no apology, no explanation, and closes the door behind him.  It was suppose to open at nine, well I'm still standing outside and it's 9:23am.</Text>

A UPS franchise not offering full services, very confusing.  Sent something to print through the UPS website and franchise location wouldn’t accept my receipt and double charged for it.  You also can’t ship electronics out of here.  Not sure why they are allowed to call themselves a UPS!</review>

We have been a P.O. Box holders for 6 years and we travel a lot.  All has been well until the last 3 months then it became a struggle to get the mail forwarded. We have been waiting 2 weeks for a some time sensitive documents. Repeated calls and emails ignored.  The Worst Company I Have Ever Used!!!!</review>

<Review>Absolutely ZERO help. As I asked for clarification or help, they sounded blatantly annoyed and simply told me to call the 1800UPS number. When I called the number they gave, I was told that ONLY the store could help.

I would rather ship my things to.... well... any single other physical location BESIDES this place.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808f80d6a205029b:0x2f159db592989794< /Gmap_id></record>

I got served by this guy Tommy lee or ni whatever, his service was horrible. I was asking him about a return service policy and he rushed me to slice my card to pay and threw a receipt and a tape nowhere faraway from me as if he wanted me to pick it up there, didn't even say 'thank you' after we were done. That was a bitter experience I had. He needs some meeting with his manager or need to take another service orientation.</review>

<text>I dropped off some packages on a friday afternoon for 3 day express ship service and they didn't even ship out. My stuff was all packed, pre-labelled, and good to go. Literally all they had to do was put my boxes on a truck, and the failed. 5 days later and my stuff is still sitting in Alameda when it's supposed to be down south! Epic fail. They had ONE JOB!</text><user_name>Ryan McCoy< /user_name>< Pics>

Weirdly short with customers. Operates differently than any other UPS store I've been in, re: filling out a form for shipments vs just printing me a label. Took way more time than necessary and gave me a cringey feeling afterward. Seems like poor management.<//review>

<text>The manager Shane completed notary service for us and he was very rude. Shane acted as if our service was a bother to him. He made sure to point out several times that we were tying him up. The entire time he barked orders to his employee that were rude and condescending. I felt sorry for the employees that were simply working. He then started to make comments like "where is so and so" he then checked a schedule and said "why the hell does he have a day off". It should be embarrassing to ups that the manager behaved so poorly. Horrible experience all around.<//text>< Time>

<review>Went on the Happy Hour Tour on my birthday and it was such a memorable experience ✨! With all of the social distancing restrictions they only had limited seating outdoors. Honestly, it was a better experience this way! It was a bit cool where we sat at the bow so bring a jacket. We split a bottle of Proseco ($28 I think) and there were snacks available that looked great... But we were saving room for dinner. 🥩 The waters were kind and smooth,  and even with all the smoke in the air you could still see the outline of the mountains across the lake. I can't even imagine the view when the air is clear. Staff was the best, so nice and VERY fast. We will absolutely return for another tour when we are back!!! Such a great value for what you get, I would have paid more and still been happy!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Smooth online registration process, nice staff, great service. Highly recommend the 1030a brunch cruise.

The blue water and beautiful day added to the experience, but this was certainly one of the highlights of our trip to Tahoe.

Not be underestimated but the tour guide/boat captain was exceptional on our tour.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbCgYqo_kTQwUtQK_1llRnPadWt3NiSHlLkEM7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIUSjY9_gGhuadOqrgY3PpF0oPY_n_osAuF0ii=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

My husband and I held our wedding on the deck of the Tahoe Gal. Larry and his crew were friendly and extremely accommodating. The food was also delicious. Our group had a fantastic time. The Tahoe Gal made our wedding very special and memorable!< /Review>

The food and drinks were excellent. The only thing, and it is not worth removing a star, that wasn't perfect is they were out of a few things on the menu but it is the end of the cruise season. I'm just glad they are able to continue operating with everthing that's going on with Covid. My hats off to all businesses that are making it work.</review>< Pics>

The reviews on their food are bad, so we thought “Great! We’ll have an early dinner, then go enjoy drinks on the boat.” The morning of the cruise two members of my party get calls from two different people. First call is from a woman who says we are being “upgraded to a private room.” She was told we really wanted to be out on the deck. She said the room is really open and has a deck so you can go outside. The second call was from Larry to another member of our group. He also claimed the room is an upgrade and said that because of the size of our party (12) that was really the only option. So we agreed because it was that or cancel and we were leaving Tahoe the next day. That evening we arrive and the “upgraded” room is a small, stuffy, hot room behind the person driving the boat. Dirty glass windows that don’t open on two sides.  The deck we could go out on was actually a small walkway where we were constantly bumped by wait staff elbowing past with trays. We asked to talk to Larry about it before boarding and he told us “You agreed! Too bad!” Wow. The customer service is seriously lacking. I could share more details in that regard, but this review is already quite long. In summary, I strongly do not recommend.< /Text>< date>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Tahoe Gal dinner cruise, 2.5 hours, was terrific. Although a bit pricey when dinner is added in, the experience outstanding.

The paddleboat has a dining area below and an upper deck, both with tables and chairs.

The prime rib and salmon were very nice, side dishes were adequate.

Boat has a well stocked bar.

Staff did a nice job and were friendly to guests. Restroom was good.

Half of the cruise occcured in daylight and we were able to see the sun set.

We did the lunch cruise around emerald bay and the views are fantastic and the captain’s narratives were interesting. A few important notes-  it was way too long to bring kids under 12. They were bored and ended up sleeping through the second half of it so that was a complete waste of money. More importantly- the food is atrocious. Plan to eat a hearty meal beforehand because you’re basically held captive for three and half hours during lunch time and $22 for literally the worst nachos you can imagine (think less-than movie theater quality, stale chips, cheap store bought  queso, and low grade store bought salsa (Note to owners- Costco has way more authentic  salsa options that are probably less expensive to keep in stock) and no available additions like guacamole or sour cream) and the pizza was $20 for only four tiny slices (enough for one kid, definitely not big enough to share) and only bearable because we were all so hungry. The sandwiches were only OK but much, much better than the previously mentioned items. Overall, I’d say for the cost of the ticket and the cost of the food, it is definitely not worth it. Especially if you have hungry kids. To the owners- please invest in a professional chef to create an easy menu that has quality food, or cut the prices of the food in half because the quality for the price is simply not justifiable, especially when we aren’t permitted to bring our own food on board. If the food were better than I would say it was worth the cost of the entire experience. Perhaps just book a shorter trip not focused around lunchtime dining.< /text>

We took the 3 1/2 hour 12:30 cruise from Tahoe City to Emerald Bay and back, with lunch available for purchase. What an amazing experience! The captain did a wonderful job with his dictation of the history of the lake, the servers and bartenders were top notch, and the scenery was of course to die for! We would definitely do this again! What a relaxing way to see the lake and enjoy an afternoon. My only knock would be that the food and drinks were quite spendy!<//Text>

I’ve been on all the Tahoe Cruises and this is by far the best.  The staff was exceptional and the food was actually quite good.  My past experiences with the other cruises was not pleasant culinary wise so this was a pleasant surprise.  I like that the cruise doesn’t include the food as part of the fare because it gives you options to just enjoy the scenery and eat elsewhere either before or after if you choose.  I’ll do this one again when folks come to visit but not the others which are overpriced for what you get.  Another big plus is the free parking!< /review>

Thank you for the memorable anniversary and a special thank you to Captain and crew for being very down to earth and very personable with my boys, definitely made some memories for them.  Even though we are Bear's fans  lol<//review></record>

The cruise was a lovely view of the lake. Go just for that!  The drinks were overpriced as was the food. I would encourage you to skip the food based solely on the nachos I ordered. They were not worth the $18.95. They were mediocre at best.</Text>

Overpriced food and inattentive servers. We had nachoes that were similar to those at a little league ballpark, but much pricier. The bucket of Coronas was hot. 18% gratuity is automatically added to all checks.

The cruise itself was nice and peaceful. We were told there would be music and commentary, neither of which ever happened. This cruise is a "cram as many people as possible on the boat, make a lap, and dock with a little effort as possible" type cruise.< /review>

This cruise ship is not handicap accessible as they claim. My partner is in a wheelchair, and even though I called before getting on the cruise to confirm that there were handicap accessible ways to get on the boat/enjoy most of the activities/use the bathroom, the bathrooms were not accessible at all. Getting physically on to the boat was fine, but getting from the on-ramp area into the first floor cabin was tough. We had to really squeeze the chair through the door to get it in.

From moving chairs to sit at a table was fine, but the bathroom situation was the worst. There were two small single-stall rooms. The men's was completely inaccessible to a wheelchair, and the women's was supposed to be "handicap accessible". I informed the crew that I didn't think that a chair would be able to enter the bathroom and close the door, and they insisted that it would be fine. They asked if we would be able to fold the chair to bring it into the room..... to which I had to explain that my partner cannot use their legs so there is no option to fold the chair because they need to be in the chair when entering. They said that they could have the makeshift solution of keeping a further up door open, blocking view of the women's bathroom, and they could have the kitchen keep the galley door closed to give my partner privacy in case the door didn't close. I still didn't believe the chair would fit so I had my partner try to enter the women's room..... the chair didn't even fit through the door frame. Meaning that this cruise thought it okay for my partner to relieve themselves in a hallway?

So yes, you can board the boat in a wheelchair, but you'd need a bladder of steel during dinner and drinks to survive because the chances that you'd be able to use the bathroom are slim unless you have a child-sized chair. I am most disappointed in the poor expectation setting when I called, and the fact that the onboard crew insisted it would be possible to fit a wheelchair in the bathroom.

On a separate note, the food wasn't good. We rented out the boat and had a prefixes menu with four options. I can confirm that at least 3/4 were bad. The teriyaki salmon had a sauce that was sickeningly sweet. The prime rib seemed tasteless. The Portobello mushroom dish tasted like everything had been marinated in straight balsamic vinegar for days. On  positive note, The views of the lake were fantastic, and if you were able bodied this cruise would be beautiful. But don't come for the food. Come for the views only.<//review>

We booked tickets like 2 hours before. Checked in right below cvs in tahoe city and were on our way. The only down side of cruising on the north side os missing the sunset but the sky is amazing regardless. We saw the rising of the moon (HUGE) over the water. Food was delicious if a little pricy but you dont  have to have it. Free boarding for active military another great perk. We enjoyed our anniversary dinner on top and they were nice enough to play our wedding song so we danced in the moonlight on lake tahoe. Definitely a memory forever. Great service. Great experience.<//review>

Kind servers, but could have asked more frequently if we wanted another round of drinks. Beautiful scenery.  Cheesecake was good too.  Great way to see the lake in a peaceful atmosphere.  We really enjoyed the sunset cruise!!<//text>

Average cruise.  I expected the captain to speak about the area, that's what I've experienced on other cruises.</Text>

Great cruise. Very relaxing, the food and service is good and the crew is friendly. My husband and I enjoyed it a lot and may want to come back again.< /review>

<text>Not worth the money. If "cruise" means going back and forth on a 2 mile stretch of the lake is a type of cruise your looking for then go for it. We were disappointed to not see more of the lake. We ordered the chicken breast. It was overcooked and dry. Went to pay my bill in cash. I counted and recounted to ensure I had enough for the bill. Waitress comes back to say I'm $20 short.

Not worth it for the sunset Cruise. Spend your money elsewhere.

Also appears my first submission got deleted. Will be reposting this every time it gets deleted by the owner.< /text>< Time>

Awesome cruise! Smooth and relaxing! We had a big group with a number of kids and everyone was very happy. We enjoyed  watching the lake while it was still daylight and then sunset. Plenty of space on board. We didnt have dinner but drinks and icecream were very good. The Captain and crew members are very friendly, courteous and easy-going. Free parking and the cruise departed and returned right on time. 10/10 will do it again whenver we come back to Tahoe.

Tips: booking online has a fee. So call them to book your reservation to save some money.</text>

If I could do less than one star I would. We were running late, which is our fault, but we called ahead and they said they would wait for us. As we were running down the dock the boat pulled out.<//text>

I wanted to do something fun with my nephew and also surprise my sister. I took him to Gold Comb barbershop and got him the cutest looking fade haircut. He loved getting a “big boy” haircut and my sister loved how his hair looked when he came to pick him up.</Review>

looking for a clean haircut? This is the place. I’ve been getting my hair cut by Alex for years now and have no plans to go anywhere else. He’s meticulous and does a great job.

The whole staff is very welcoming, and the shop is always clean. Great place!< /text>

Travis! I started going to Travis about a year ago and now I can't imagine going to anyone else. He has consistently given me the best hair cuts and beard trims. Even better he taught me how to better style and manage my hair between sessions.

And of coarse, Travis and the Gold Comb team have created a very relaxed and comfortable vibe. The place is just cool!<//Text>

<Review>Gold Comb is just plain awesome. The barbers are top notch people and killer at what they do! It's literally the only place I trust to cut my whacky curly hair, so much so that I've been following these barbers around for over 5 years. I've had my hair cut by at least 4 of their barbers, and the cut always comes out clean. They can even hit you with the hot cream razor finish around the edges. Don't waste your time going anywhere else, this is the spot!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80d954f5ce7ea75f:0x9e9b7cff91641707</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This was extra hard during the ongoing pandemic. I am very lucky I found Gold Comb Barbershop only about 3 days after I move.

<text>Years ago I unknowingly clicked two stars and I had no idea. This was a huge error on my part. Without a doubt this is the best barbershop in San Diego. I’ve been going here for the last four years. I’ve seen three different barbers and have had an amazing experience every time. I don’t have a single complaint!< /text><Rate>5<//Rate><gmapID>0x80d954f5ce7ea75f:0x9e9b7cff91641707<//gmapID>< user_id>

My husband has always been terrible about getting his haircut. He lets it grow out and it looks sloppy. Our daughter was getting married and I told him there was no chance he was going to the wedding without a nice haircut. He told me he would only go if I found the place and set it all up for him. I saw Gold Comb barbershop in North Park up pop up when I was looking online. I was able to easily book an appointment for my husband online. His haircut turned out perfect for the wedding, nice and clean cut. I’ll be forcing him to come back here more often.<//text>

-Great attention to detail
-Remembers my style every time I come in
-Enjoyable conversations

Travis has mastered the craft of barbering and I'm confident that anyone looking for a change will be impressed with his work.</review>< user_name>

I have been going to gold comb since its inception, and while i almost always get my cut from Monica, I have gotten cuts from Travis and Adam as well, and cannot recommend this place enough. The staff all really care about their craft. They do a killer job and knock it out of the park every single time. Great conversation, fantastic shaves, and phenomenal fades. 10/10 would recommend.< /Text>

My barber, Travis does a superb job. His detail-oriented approach creates the  consistency I'm looking for in any barber. He's also great to converse with on many topics so it makes the experience even more robust.

With great prices, service and location, it's hard to find any reason why you wouldn't try out your next cut or any other related service at GC!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Travis is the best! Every time I’m in SD I stop by to get my haircut and beard trim from him. Throughout my travels Travis is the best barber I’ve been to. He listens to your concerns and thoughts and gives his own opinion on what he think might work best for you. He has a very natural haircut style and always makes my beard look perfect. I couldn’t recommend him or Gold Comb enough! Thanks again Travis!<//review>

Great haircut, cool people. I even got some gratis advice on beard care. I'll be back. Side note: I really wish they'd do more with the interior. It feels a little empty.< /text>

I always used to go to genetic barber shops to get my hair cut, and they always left something to be desired. I finally decide to treat myself and try something new. Got my first haircut from Adam and was shocked that I had waited so long to make this change. When he told me he was opening his own place I of course became a client and have never looked back. The barbers really take their time to make sure you always get a great haircut<//review>

These guys are so nice and polite and quick! I'm so glad my husband referred me to them. They took me within 10 minutes after I called them. Reasonably priced. Thanks guys! I'll spread the word!<//review>

I walked in with the coupon on the website and the guy told me to go to the shop up the road as they no longer honor the coupon.  I guess the shop is under new ownership? Go to the shop 21st Avenue Smog Test Only.  Charged me $40 which is pretty reasonable. I am only giving 5 stars because he was totally upfront with me and I got my smog done quickly at the next shop.<//Text>

<text>I arrived on Saturday around 12 to get my smog check- the gentleman behind the desk barked at me if I had an appointment to which I responded no.  He sternly told me to return at 1.  A drove back at 1 and the shop was closed- the gate pulled and no response to a phone call.  I won’t be coming back to this place<//text></record>

Showed up at 4:30 p.m.  I didn't even step out of my car when an old guy kicked me out saying he was closed.   I mentioned his posted business hours are 6:00 p.m. So as I was leaving he came back out  and cursed at me saying not to come back, for no apparent reason.   Avoid this place and go  elsewhere.</review>

<Text>I must admit I’m kinda bummed to hear the old grouchy guys gone. 😆 he never cursed at me or hung up, he even answered all my questions. But he was definitely GROUCHY & RUDE. Anyway the price is cheaper, it’s conveniently located so I can go on my lunch break.  In/ out in 15mins or less. Works for me!< /Text></record>

UNBELIEVABLE JACK-AS*. Stumbled into this place because other smog tests nearby were closed. I started with "good morning" and was met with rudeness on a level I have never experienced before. After 2 sentences of abuse I just walked out. Anyone on this review thread that gives more than one star is a reviewer-bot that has never been there or is otherwise fake.< /text>

<Text>Never Never Go This Place! I should have rated it zero or minus stars if possible. I should have checked the other reviews before stepping in there. The only reason I went is their big "smog test" sign so I didn't stop by other test places on 21st Ave. I bet they should be better, at least not worse.

This old guy is extremely rude, treating you like you owe him big $$$. Despite a coupon, he cheated and charged you additional amount. Be aware---don't go even you got coupon.

After his check, my car felt not right with the brake. I was really concerned that he might have damaged my car, intentionally or by accident. Now I need to bring my car to mechanic check.

Again, I strongly recommend you never go this place, ever!!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1544493852680</Date><Rating>1</Rating><review>I arrived today (12/10/18) with a coupon that was printed out a week earlier (something like $25+$9 certificate fee). The person informed me that the coupon was not valid because the business was under new ownership (as of just the past week? really?). But he would do it for about $5 more. Then, as I was about to go for it, he said that it would be an additional $10 for some random reason that wasn't mentioned on the coupon. As I started to object, he snapped "are you going to argue with me?!?" Unbelievable. I wouldn't trust this place to touch my car at any price.< /review>< pictures>

I've always put up with the terrible customer service here, but at least the owner at that time would honor the coupon they posted on their website. This new owner tried to charge extra $10 for SUV?? He must be confusing this like a car wash! Never heard of a $10 fee for SUV?!? I had my registration card and he said he would have to charge $20 more because I don't have DMV papers?!? Clearly a new owner that doesn't know what he is doing. Don't think I'm coming back here again.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Dropped the car around 12 pm for a smog. The guy working there said he has a couple cars ahead of me but could start in about 1 hour. 4 hours later still no call so I called him up. Said he needed more time like 30 min. Finally calls me at 5 to come by and pick the car. I show up and I see that he still has the car on the rollers. He then said that he could NOT smog it because there was a problem with the machine.

Total BS and waste of my time. That place also looks so run down. Avoid going there at all costs, that place will hopefully close down.</Text>< pics>

<Text>I drove by Express Smog and was in a hurry so I dropped in. I was asked whether I had a coupon or a price that I had seen and I said no. I was then told the price was going to be over $80 for a successful test even though the price they advertise on their website is much lower. I should have had the good sense to say no at that point, but I was in a hurry and my registration was due.

The test machine had technical difficulties and kept aborting the test. The attendant said there was a problem with my car's computer or hardware and offered a free retest if I got it repaired.  It seems to be quite uncommon that a smog shop would demand that you pay when an abort occurs. But the contract covered this case, so I paid the already outrageous sum and left empty-handed.

After spending $55 at my local mechanic for an inspection, they couldn't find anything wrong with my car and since I hadn't had any repair it didn't make sense to go back to the original smog shop. I took the car to a different smog shop and it passed smogged on the first try.

I went back for a refund since there appeared to be no issue with my car but was sadly refused. When I said I would be making this negative review, the attendant called the police and accused me of threatening him and threatening to destroy his business.

When the police came, we explained our sides of the story and the police officer politely informed the man that I was allowed to post reviews online and suggested that he give me a refund if he didn't want that. He still refused.

So I cannot recommend express smog. They overcharged me relative to their advertised price, had (what seems to be) broken equipment, and they call the police on their customers.< /Text>< UserId.>

<text>My worst customer experience ever.   I will never go back.  The guy a real jacka**.  He has horrible customer service skills very unpleasant to be around.  He told me information about my smog and I did not understand part of it so I asked him again and I quote his response "I hate having to explain myself more than once". He proceeded to go laid down on the couch as a would be paying customer left upset. I hope this review will help prevent any future business. Other reviews on this place will back me up.</text>< Pictures>

Owner seems very tight on cash, so seems to be looking for any way to make extra cash.  One approach is to fail the visual inspection, to force customers to buy a part.

This is exactly why the state mandated Test-only stations.  And I am an expert in this domain, for having built software for reservation and testing for auto stations and smog checks, that served tens of thousands of drivers in California.

DETAILS: Went in with a 10yr old BMW, he inspects it. 10mn later, comes to me and says the computer is failing you because of the gas cap.  You can buy one here - the gas cap is one of the VERY FEW parts this place sells...ironically. He tries the gas cap, won't fit. Then eventually admits that the computer and exhaust tests were fine.  He had made the subjective decision to fail me due to a cracked gas cap...which I had trouble seeing.
Bottom line: he lied by claiming the computer was failing, admitting later it wasn't the computer.  But he couldn't sell me the part cause it didn't fit.  Maybe this guy thought I was an ignorant fool who would just buy the part.

I'm never using this station again, and am warning others not to.  It's easy to just pick another one.< /Review>

<review>There's this man who answers their phone of which doesn't have business answering the phones cuz he was very very rude.  NO PROFESSIONALISM NOR PERSONALITY.  Prospective customers shld not take their business to 101 Smog check because of its unfriendly & uncourteous attitudes even if they do a good job maybe since I never went there. I will not even give them a 1 star but there's no rating ZERO stars. 101 Smog, get rid of this dude. He is NOT doing good for your business.</review>< GmapID>

It was my first time at classy nail spa; I was expecting sun para and instead got amazing staff that went above and beyond to give me the look I wanted.

Not to mention the quality of the products 😆😆🎯. Hands down one of the best experiences I have had at a nail salon in a long time.

I plan to make classy nail spa my only shop.

Thanks again for the great glow in the dark full set.
And Chanel pedicure.<//Text>

Busy and waited for a long time but it was fine because they were upfront about it in the beginning, so we knew what we were getting into. Nails done so well and they were nice and polite. Very accommodating but be prepared to pay tips in cash or from Venmo. A pretty small salon but there's a reason why they get so much business. Will probably go get my nails done here again.< /Review>

<name>Stacey Curtis</name><time>1532039299068< /time><Rating>3<//Rating><text>So this was interesting.  We asked for two manicures and two pedicures.   They said yes and immediately put us in chairs.  They started out feet soaking in hot water which was great.  Unfortunately they did my friends entire pedicure before touching me.  They started with my manicure and all along my feet were in cold water.  By time they did my feet the water was freezing.  The girl didn’t notice until almost done and offered me hot water but I said no since it was almost done.  Our manicures turned out good...my heels could have used a little more work.   Fast forward we go to a restaurant down the street for lunch.  I spilled the cold water on my friend hands and her nails changed color.  They gave her MOOD polish!  I think she should have been warned that the color she picked was mood polish.  When the two colors changed they didn’t match each other.  We still had a good time.   The massage chair was great for relaxing.  (Her nails by the way are suppose to be the green color)<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYn7YzKUzzprAPZtLx89vNJZ53zAXCChAs4uf5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-1wNDa8mRoRCAQv4gLWrRyDtHzZGulChMFjvc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMONslJNXmwHLv-5r4tquk0B0cxDpjoA1JvIcIE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_cZwqVESaaUGaRIwk6s4GAFlKekxGQY-yOEeq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMugkMWl8Q92AGCKBPy-yfFqq3vnWKq4WwYdPkN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-E1iGl1FmhQLgDschiBYaAnvYSXzzeK15rS04=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

<Text>Great pedicure.  This place is always packed, so I could only assume how good they were.  I know loads of people always complain about the service at nails salons, as in rude workers, or talking about customers, but service to me at a nail salon is the quality of the service.  The deluxe pedicure was well worth it.  Great massage, she put some TLC into scrubbing and cleaning up my feet.  I love the hot towels and the paraffin dip. Very gentle and did a great job on the polish job.  Make sure you tell them right away what kind of pedicure you want, apparently I did not tell them "early" enough I wanted a deluxe and I missed a few steps of the deluxe pedicure.  They prefer cash, but take card.  Nice selection of polishes.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Customer service: Some nail techs are great and nice, some are not so welcoming.

Price: On the pricey side.

Parking: Only side street parking is available either in front of the shop or around the neighborhood.

Hours: Always open, even on the holidays except for Thanksgiving and NY day.

Tip: Most times there is a wait, so don’t think you’ll just spend 30 minutes here.<//text><time>1521388497910<//time>< GmapID>

Horrible place. First off they will have you waiting up till 3-4 hours to finish your nails. My friend and I arrived at 12:30 and didn’t get seated till 1:30. One of the employees helped us out for 10 min and left and continued to help customers that had just walked in. She had me seated for 30! Minutes waiting for someone to continue my nails and then they would come back and help for another 10 min and leave and help another costumer. It is very frustrating and unprofessional and they should hire more staff. I was seated at 1:30 and didn’t leave until 3:45 and most of the time they WERE NOT helping me out. It is also a robbery because for a regular acrylic set it is $35 and they charged me $39. They have very poor customer service and are RUDE! NEVER AGAIN<//Review>

<review>I called a day before and they were very accommodating by giving me an appointment the next morning.
They were pretty busy but they still saw us very close to our appointment time. We had two fills done and color change. Rose did an amazing job with my nails and she was also really friendly, engaging, and informative. My best friends nails also looked great. They had great attention to detail.  I would visit them again, maybe try a pedicure this time.
I didn't give the place a 5 star because the place was very busy so I felt rushed in and out. I also felt it was a little higher priced.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< rate>

My last visit was the worst! My daughter and I went to get nails and feet done, only to have me sat in spa chair for 1.5 hours, wirh my feet soaking, only to be told I was not going to be able to get pedicure😤. They do not have adequate customer service skills nor time management skills. However, Hannah is an awesome nail tech; this horrible experience was the result of me going on her day off. Lost a good customer...<//review>

<Text>I live in Alameda, I used to be a client every 2 weeks, but not anymore. Do not make an appointment because it is useless, attend one by one. They do not respect if you have an appointment, they are only interested in serving as many people as possible, you must have to wait up to 1 hour, so be prepared to wait!!
The prices are fine, but now I prefer to pay a little more and not waste my time waiting.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I went here for a full set, and they looked great! I attempted to remove my nails at home, but found out they use MMA, an illegal monomer known to cause cancer. Please do NOT go here! They use an illegal substance that can hurt you, and your nails< /text>

A girl in here name be was really good at hooking my nails up. I decided to get metallic gel. The nail samples are all in one container together and they don't tell you until the last moment that metallic cost more, they probably don't get it very often so when you actually don't want to tell you it cost more they just want you to get it, but my nails did turn out great so I cannot complain and I also have the funds to do it so it did not irritate me</text>

First time going to Classy Nails Spa in Alameda on Park St since I was waiting for Monkey King to open. I absolutely love Tina who did my service. She was nice and paid close attention to everything I needed her to do for my pedicure. She was gentle, kind and made sure the shape and length of my toe nails were to my liking. My French manicure was Perfect! She did everything to my specification. I will be back. I will say, its a little confusing when you enter the shop because there is no one to really assist you and they do not know who is next but I just walked right in and Tina approached me right away.</Text>

<Text>So even after making an appointment they apparently told 8 other people they also had an appointment at the same time as me and also took 2 other walk-ins with a staff of 7. So of course this is a nail shop that you need to designate your whole day too. My pedicurist at did a decent job, but definitely nothing special, no sugar scrub and I did have to ask for the callus remover and after she spent 35 mins on the metallic design on my big toes it came out nothing like what I chose, she took it upon herself to start over which took another 35 mins before someone else came to fix her error. I was in the nail shop for 4.5 hours! The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because my nails came out ok other than that this place will never have my business. There lack of customer service and ownership when they know they wasted my time baffles me.</Text>< pictures>

I was looking for a new nail shop and heard great things about Classy nails. Well my experience was not of Classy.

I usually spend an hour with gel manicure and pedicure, here I spent two hours.

Tanya rushed my nails to assist another client well a week in with my gel set and three have peeled off. Not cute for work related business and pop up booths I run.

They offered to fix it but why when I would need to return a week after.

I will not recommend this place. I can't believe they have 5 stars.<//Review>

< Review>
I was taken there by my besty for my 40th and had the Man'y- Ped'y done. That was in Oct of 2012. Now I am pretty ruff on my feet. Which they had made a new before I left. My Pedy didn't come off or ware down until I took it off Dec of 2012. So needless to say I went back for my New Years gift to myself. Had to have another one of those amazing ped'ys, and this time I got a Gel man'y which was done so well, they are all I am going to get from now on. The one fault I had was they were out of the color I wanted, which turn out to be a good thing; because they gave me a shoulder massage while I got my man'y :D!!< /Review>

This is a good bar with a lot of selections on tap, but not great as a restaurant. They had a special menu for St. Patrick's day, but the selection was small. The food is good. The service was a little slow and the waitress was unaware of the details of a coupon I received from running the Upland Irish 5k. Not a bad place to eat and probably good for adult parties, but there are a lot of options nearby.<//Text>

<Review>I am loathe to give less than three stars unless a business / place / service really lets me down.  Charlie's was on the bubble of getting into 2 1/2 star territory.  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt as an indy restaurant on a cute street in the historic part of Upland.

Dear Hubby and I were spending the last day of our mini vacation wandering around vintage neighborhoods in Ontario, Upland, and the surrounding areas.  We happened upon the historic district of Upland, parked the car on 2nd Avenue near the gazebo and started walking around.  There were a few antique stores open.  Restaurants were the most plentiful commodity open on a Sunday afternoon.

The striking Americana graphics for Charlie's drew us in.  I was thinking that DH and I would split a deli sandwich and be good to go until dinner time.  My pre-conceived notion of a deli counter with seating wasn't what turned out to be the situation.

Charlie's features a big bar and table seating.  In contrast to the rich wood bar that has seem some stories unfold, I imagine, the dining room is lined with big screen TV's.  The better to watch sports on.  Is it a deli?  Is it a sports bar?  Does the food live up to the beer and wine offerings?  These questions unfolded into semi-satisfactory answers.

What elevated the experience to an okay one was the quality of the hot pastrami sandwich.  The amount of well-seasoned pastrami, paired with lots of dill pickle slices and spicy mustard, sat well on a French roll.  We chose a side salad, though regular fries, sweet potato fries, and other choices also existed as part of the sandwich price.

DH and I have reached the stage where sharing meals at most restaurants is the right amount of food.  Carrying out leftovers while on a trip doesn't usually work out, and wasting food is not a good feeling.  The sandwich and salad were just right for us to share.

One point of downgrade - they had very few options for me as a beverage choice.  I don't drink caffeinated sodas, and don't enjoy sugary drinks, either.  A bar that doesn't have some non-alcoholic options more interesting than something out of the Coke machine doesn't seem like a very creative bar.  Just one woman's opinion.  If we found ourselves in the area again, I'd probably try another establishment over returning to Charlie's.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH-Mbfx-Mv1ivt597N4SaIfQRWeB9SaKM_viLh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa7_nksgd5wpAAovJi8ksQrkeoLVQacVD263ux=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5WicUgKoE0nTHPpXojqGUrOPgq0f9aaHLvU-f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJvq1IXO5_ZNUHe8o9zlhQ3rlhVDqFTJ90xWYj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_8VHmwCWrbYqwytrSerJW85_Ore_CdJcoD2k5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpoRuPgr_tloGyKbaM8TxeQ-_Pp1OS1UuX4WAg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgoOnxWoPOf8qbEP-h6MJKPMcJtSJ7OGnuaDJZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c33153f2f3e21b:0x5f8646c3512079e8<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Our service here was horrible. When my we got there we were not greeted, and had to ask if we are supposed to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. The waitress did not introduce herself & was instantly bothered when my family & I walked in. Forgot to bring one more water as she even said she would bring one. She brought it once the food was served because she forgot. As she took our order instead of pulling out a pad she wrote on her hand. She also messed up an order. Appetizers were served after our meals. What was the point if that was going to happen. We basically had to tell her how to do her job. We had to constantly ask for the same thing, napkins, utensils that the meals required. And since she wrote out orders on her hand she had to come back and asked what we ordered.

Once she realized we wanted nothing to do with her she became "attentive".</Review>

<text>The restaurant was completely empty with 3 waitresses standing around talking.. It took them 20min to give us menus that we had to ask for.. Then it took them another 10min to come take our order.. The Lemon festival had nothing to do for the horrible service we got and the laziness of the waitresses! AGAIN IT WAS EMPTY!
Worst service ever! My daughter asked for a glass of ice water and the said they couldn't and expected her to buy a tiny bottle water for $2.50 .. mind you it's a full on restaurant.  I'm a huge fan on supporting your local business.. But I will never go back again .. Save you your money for better restaurant people this place isn't worth your business.< /text>< name>

Now this place has amazing atmosphere and a staff you will actually want them to sit down and have a beer with you. Geared more for a slightly older crowd.. mostly but great if you're tired of the chaos next door. (2nd Ave. Bar and Grill) formerly (Baldy Brewery). 5* for the cooks!! Honestly, the best cooks anywhere in downtown Upland!!!</Text>

<date>1503248032765</date><Review>This is my second time at Charley's and their breakfasts are wonderful. The atmosphere caters to vets, in fact it reminds me of an upscale canteen in my Marine Corps days. They have an amazing wall of honor from veterans of many historical eras. The bar is well stocked, the menu is Americana and very reasonably priced. I am going to bring my American Legion post here. I am also looking forward to watching football games here. Great place to go! Great price. Great food. Dogs appear to be welcome to outside seating for them.<//Review><user>102910011931844826134</user><rate>5</rate><Response>None< /Response></record>

Not happy with the changes, called twice phone service was great to get some information on their backroom for a party. Came down to see the manager l, but they were there  so I asked to see the room. Room was dirty, carpets were rated and disgusting, wood floor was buckled . Tables and chairs were in poor condition.  Note this place was spotless and presented really well over a year ago and I had planned to do my 50th birthday there,  however decided to pass. Would be nice to see get back in shape like it use to be.</text>

We ordered to Alfredo's, a grilled cheese, a Caesar salad, I had a club and one other sandwich and everybody loved everything and the service was excellent very attentive server.
Nice location on the corner in the middle of the antique District great place to take a break after some serious antiquing.</review>

<Text>Not bad but too bright and loud when the bands come on.  Turn down the lights a bit its not an operating room and not saying it has to be quiet but should be able to have a conversation toward the back of the bar while the band is on..... ended up yelling at my party all night just so they could hear.  Having said that the service was great and the drinks were tasty.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Good drinks, good food, live band was great (lunchbox crackerjack) but with a name like stars and stripes as a Veteran I was hoping for a more American themed decor... or America themed menu. Overall good place and will return.<//Review>

Has absolutely amazing homemade food, pretty waitresses and great service, they have the greatest LIT's I have ever tasted in my life! They are family friendly and sometimes they have a live band! Most importantly though, they are definitely Americans! They have pictures of veterans hanging all over, they are very Patriotic! If you like shots, try their "Death Shot" wow that's great! I love this place!!!!!!!< /review>

Astonishingly bad service*

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a sign telling us to seat ourselves, which is in itself okay. We sat at a table, waited, grabbed our own menu, then waited more. To make matters worse we watched as others who arrived after us placed their orders. We called to the waitress maybe 3 times before getting frustrated at being ignored and walked out. I would understand if it was packed, but it was practically empty. Luckily, it's a Thursday and the streets are filled with great options.

*Regardless of the service, the food is pretty good. Although I will never try to eat inside the restaurant, I could see myself placing an order to pick up. If I could leave a 2.5 star review I would.< /review>

Love going to Charlie's for lunch!  They have a fantastic selection of over-stuffed deli sandwiches.  I love the corned beef!  They have a good selection of beers from local breweries.  The staff girls are fun and are always smiling.  Check 'em out.  Tell them Bob sent you!  (you won't get anything free 😉)</review>

<text>Ever since we they changed ownership, as well as the concept, the quality has genuinely declined. Charlie's Stars and Stripes is now some generic, tacky sports bar with pretty medicore food. The only reason I could give it one star despite all of it's other failings was the waitress who was pretty much the only saving grace of this place now, but he ale was ok. I could almost give it two stars because of that, but since they brought it in, I know I can also get that elsewhere. Save your money, and your time.  Charlie's, your lack of respect for the original concept, as well as your lack of respect for the original menu will be your downfall. Your establishment is dead to me, as well as any other veterans who have been there.</text>< GmapID>

< Review>
Walked in, sign says to seat ourselves, places wasn't even close to being packed. Lots of opened tables. Husband and I take a seat. Granted, today was Christmas parade, but again lots of opened tables. Inside I only saw 2 waitresses. Neither came over to us for the 15 minutes we sat there. Not even a "we'll be right we you" or anything. Its was around 10:30 am we got there, so the parade hadn't even started. Decided we weren't going to be served anyway and so we went to Genoveva's, a lovely Mexican place on 9th street.

Have no idea what the food is like, and probably never will as the experience didn't endear us to this place. Not very inclined to come back.< /Review>

Do you love the hot spinach artichoke dip here? Me too!! Imagine my disappointment to find out they don't have it anymore.  Tragic. Also, when we finished eating it was clear  that our presence was no longer welcome, someone even picked up all the water glasses while asking "are you done?" I guess we are. A band was setting up; however,  there were still empty tables. Ok, we took the hint and left. The food was good, but I wish I had that dip!<//text>

The waitresses were doing the best they could however there was one bartender one waitress and another young lady whose was bussing tables and ask if we need anything but was too young to get any drinks or take any orders. The establishment was quite packed we where there almost two hours just ordered wings and one drink each. The wings looked kind of odd and they were really dry wasn't good. We didn't even eat them.
To be fair there was an event going on that day the staff seemed completely overwhelmed. This was our third visit it's been so-so each time.</Text>

<Text>Charlie’s Has good Deli Sandwiches and it Honors the Military.  You can bring your  military picture of a spouse or grandparent etc. and they'll put on the wall . Has changed owners.

Worst service I've ever had. The food was really good but the customer service was horrible. Dani the bar tender/server spent most of her time taking shots and chatting it up with the young guys at the bar. We had a table of 8 and we had to constantly go order our cocktails from the bar. Dani was rude and her customer service sucked. Owners should really take a close look at labor and get more employees to cover the floor. Two servers on a busy Friday night and Dani the bar tender was one of them. The ownership is shooting themselves in the foot for such horrible service in such a good place to eat. 8 potential new customers will NOT be back.</Text>

GREAT food, horrible service. Good live music(tonight). Took almost an hour to get drinks.
Update: Server apologized (unprompted) for service. Short staffed. They brought a day shifter back in to finish the night.< /Review>

<Review>I was over charged.  Did not complain, yet I did not tip well because of that and I'm a good tipper.  Service was friendly and food was good, although the wings did have a good amount of hair left on them, which grossed my son out.  Nothing worth the amount I paid.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I walk in this restaurant with my family and immediately when we were sat down by a waitress, the waitress was giving us attitude and rushing me and my family to order. Then they were taking quite some time to bring us what we ordered, so we asked once more to bring what we ordered. My sisters ages 4 and 9 asked for lemonade when we first got there. The bartender brings my sisters there drinks. My sisters took large sips of the drinks and realized that the drink didn't taste accustomed to what lemonade should taste like. My parents sampled my sisters drinks and realized that it was not normal lemonade. The waitress came over and tasted the drinks and it was alcohol in my underage sisters drinks. This is unacceptable and the worst experience i have ever had at a restaurant.<//Review>< Pictures>

Nice place to eat in the mid morning to late lunch time. After that, the place gets a little crowded with the local-yocals that get buzzed by 8pm. The juke box is a Touchtunes unit with lots of different music. They have local draft brews and some classic flavors. Stop by early and stay late.< /Text>

If you plan on dining in the late afternoon to early evening, the 5 to 7 time sit in the back of the restaurant as the sun is blinding coming through the front windows and no window coverings.plan on ordering a few drinks and a appetizer to off set slow service and hope you enjoy kereoki on a Wednesday evening which starts at 7pm. Food service is slow.........
Good selection of ipa beer and drinks menu has a great selection of American dishes< /text>

Only reason I took off one star was because the waiter was not very attentive with only a few other patrons inside.< /review><Time>1497248319408</Time>< Resp>

The food is just ok. Sometimes they host annoying karaoke or Trivial sessions- it get's too loud in an almost empty place. Service is not bad, but if you want to customize your order, you'll bother the "chef".  Just a place to take a beer, eat something but without expectations.< /review>

Walked in sat down nobody makes contact, went to the restroom came back and still nothing.. Chick thats off the clock helps out by changing tv channel, and giving a couple there bill bcause no servers around and bartender just tending to the bar flies.. Guess thats why place looks slow everytime my family and i go out to eat at local spots<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Asked if they had weed pipes, I was told no. But why wouldn't they have them. They are a smoke shop. Still I was told that they don't carry weed pipes. But when I turned around and looked in the next display case, it was full of weed pipes. All types size, shapes, and color. I bought one cause I needed it. Don't know why they act the way that they did.  She hurried and or rushed me out of the shop. Maybe cause I was african american. Hopefully not!!!<//Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1618504855535, 'text': 'Hello Ms. hall! Hope you’re having a great day! So because we only have a tobacco license, not a paraphernalia license, by law we are forced to say no if anyone asks for a “weed pipe” or anything else in that nature that we sell at the store. Just like I would need a liquor license to sell alcohol, weed is the same concept. If ever caught it would be a huge fine and they would shut our store down as a first offense. I apologize for the confusion and hope to continue doing business in the future with you!'}</resp>

I spent over a $100 on a product that was damaged new right out of the box tried to return it for another they said no. I wasn't even asking for my money back I just wanted it replaced with one that worked. Very pissed off. I will never spend money there again neither will my friends or family.< /Review>< pictures>

Great 420 Glassware & overall display! Staff is very informative on equipment as well as helpful with guiding new smokers with finding the right tools. Prepare yourself here this upcoming Hippy Hill holiday before venturing into San Franciscos largest free cannabis event! Especially now that it's been legalized!

Good shop. Good service. Big selection of stuff. Crazy cheap. The amount of trainers in there is insane! I wasn't hassled too much when I got in. And I was in the store for a while. Military discount was a nice treat as well I think it was ten percent. In an outlets with not many stores this is probably the best.< /Text>

This place has the best backpacks. Nike also has the best running shoes or sports shoes! Nike also sells very cool sweaters and shirts!!! The best part is that if you gift Nike stuff to your friends, they are 100 percent gonna love it!< /Text>

Great service, I visited the store for a claim, my brother bought three pairs of pants but only got two, Angel was very helpful he checked the receipt and made extra sure to give me the right pair of pants, size and style, he was quick and polite, great experience.<//Text>

<review>There's a decent variety of clothes & shoes.
The prices are kinda expensive on clothing depending on what you get, but what can you expect from it being Nike©.< /review>< Pics>
