Pretty modern style school.  Basically it's a very new school compares to others (if you like a historical one, then it's not the one).  Very high population of Asian students, sometimes you may feel you are in Asia.  Many parking lots (not free) available.  HWY I-5 is nearby.  Easy access.<//review>

Where the good kids go to school if they can swing it and I know the tech recruiters are way into the graduates, by experience, literally nothing like the recruiting going on at UCSD. Been to job fairs at both, and dealt with students from both and would take a UCSD grad over a UCSD grad for 90+% of the entry level jobs- these kids will tend to be more connected, and better mannered.  Very well off kids go to school here but don't usually flaunt it. lots of the old money and Catholic money ends up here.< /Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Pros: beautiful landscaping and fountains, interesting majors, and 60,%of applicants are accepted.
Cons: safe spaces, coddling of students, catering to emotional outspoken minorities, and generally treating young adults like they are earning a degree at extended summer camp.
Summary: your dollars are better spent at 2 years of community college Gen Eds, followed by 2 years at SDSU or UCSD...unless you have more money than motivation. This is all from a political moderate 29-year old in his last undergrad semester. I earned my place here and saved for a long time to afford this tuition. It was a mistake.</Review>< pics>

Dustin Hollabaugh graduated with honors?  It certainly wasn't for his English or spelling.  He is an alumnus, not an alumni.  Oh, by the way, he doesn't know how to use too instead of to.  It is a great university for its professors, campus, climate and location.  It gives the person who barely got by in college a chance to excel in graduate school so that once they graduate they become a part of the alumni.<//review>

This school will nickel and dime you until you are broke and will NOT help you with the $50,000 a year tuition. They slap on penalty after penalty so you end up paying more than $50k a year. When you ask for financial help, they will tell you to get a loan. I don't recommend going to this school unless you enjoy paying an arm and a leg for a slightly above average education. If you are not rich, don't go here.</review>

<review>I am an alum who graduated in 2009 with honors. From my perspective USD lacks an academic focus and caters to wealthy students regardless of their ability. Tuition is far too high for the quality of education you will receive. The financial aide office encourages students and parents to take out large loans and the school prioritizes increasing the size of its endowment over lowering the total cost to current students. There are much better schools in California at a lower cost. I cannot recommend my alma mater to prospective students.<//review><Time>1509581660470</Time><gmapID>0x80deaab8bc658bcf:0xd774e81608b43a68< /gmapID>< pictures>

<review>The University accepted my son to the credential program August 2011. After 2 years and more than $32000 in tuition he is not being allowed to do his student teaching because, in the opinion of some professors, he lacks the skills they require. These professionals (who demand that the credential candidates be able to reach and teach all students no matter what their learning styles or disabilities) should be knowledgeable enough to bring out the best in a  young man who has wanted to be a teacher since in the seventh grade he was chosen by his teacher to tutor other students in reading. The professionals who are standing in the way of his dream need to evaluate their own teaching. What did they do to ensure my son's success in their program? What can they teach others when they themselves have failed as teachers?< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>I heard that USD is an excellent private university. They have highly accredited teaching, law, technology, language, environmental and psychology schools, as well as a number of others. I also heard that their physical education school is quite good.
USD is one of our nation's top rated colleges in regards to higher education and just to get admitted, you must score fairly high on the SAT ( Taking the ACT can always helps too ) and presenting the admissions evaluation committee with a high school GPA that shows that you were in the top percentile of your graduating class is very beneficial; it also helps to have done some volunteer work and to have been on at least one or two high school committees. All of these combined together should help you gain admission to USD.
This college is quite competitive-as are most of our best colleges nowadays. Most of USD's professors are seasoned-the best in our country-and very demanding; graduating in four years means a lot of hard work and can be a wearisome task and often taking a couple of summer session classes or a class or two during Christmas break can help one graduate within this time scale.
They do offer scholarships however, these are difficult to get and student loans ( Federal Educational Grants can easily surpass fifty-thousand dollars a year!
USD's tuition is at the high end of the scale, especially if you live off of campus ( The City of San Diego is amongst the ten highest priced "cost of living" metropolitan areas in the USA ). There are hundreds of nice condominiums, townhouses and apartments within the surrounding area however, the rental rates for a one to four bedroom unit start at about $900 to $1200 per room ( living together ) per month or about $2200 for a two bedroom townhouse/apartment, to $3500+ for a three to four bedroom ; I'm just giving you a general idea...it's a might expensive to live anywhere in San Diego.
USD has many of the most beautifully designed buildings in San Diego; architectural masterpieces. Tourists who come to visit San Diego often include this private university in their sightseeing itinerary, as the photographic opportunities around this campus are simply marvelous; especially on a clear winter day from about early afternoon to sunset.
They have a small visitors center, as you drive through their main entrance center and if you get lost, you should stop and ask a couple of students and they may be able to help you?
There's a lot to see, including San Diego's famed Tecalote State Park, which lies just below the north side of this university.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><date>1541396299837</date><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Text>The campus is pretty.  The teachers, at least those who are fluent in English, are mediocre, and those whose English language skills are very poor, are token so this campus can brag about being diverse.  The dorms are so noisy that it is impossible to do any work in one's own room or get any sleep before 3 a.m.  The people responsible for policing the dorms are too lazy and callously indifferent  to do anything, and no matter how many complaints are made, it is a nightmare to live in the dirty, smelly and horribly noisy dorms.  The religious classes, which are mandatory, are a total waste of time and not based on any accurate facts or historical accuracy. The head of the Student Health Center is dishonest and harmful, willing to smear any student she takes a hatred to.  There are no responsible administrative officers to be found if you have a problem.  This is not the place if you care about getting a solid and admirable education.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80deaab8bc658bcf:0xd774e81608b43a68< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

As a university USD fails in a lot of the ways other American school's do-- in the cost. It's a very expensive place to learn. There are a lot of amazing people at the University who seem to really care about their jobs, the students, and their community.
The food is incredibly expensive on campus, and it's private with no outside businesses providing food, which they spin as a good thing, but regardless it isolates lower income students who can't afford to eat on campus.
The trams don't run on a reliable time schedule and parking is difficult. It's also difficult to walk from the parking structures to the main campus because it's very hilly.
If you're looking for a place with great staff, USD is up there. Though you could get an equal education for much less in price I'm sure.</text>

A very beautiful school. Well kept and great campus. Unfortunately, USD is not all hyped up like people think. It is difficult to get the classes that you want (also due to the few amount of courses available). The tuition is very expensive and it seems to just be going to the aesthetic of the campus. You have to do everything their way or you get nothing.
Thought that this school would set me and my mates up for job careers and help us find jobs, but no such luck thus far.
After graduating, all they keep asking for is money and not once do they ever ask to help you look for a job.
Make sure you dont just get distracted by the look of the school. Yes, it is a beautiful campus with an ocean view, but there is more to USD that meets the eye. Do your research before coming here!< /review>

While Clermont may not like the school embracing gays and lesbians, I certainly do. Bravo, USD, for not allowing religion to cloud your judgement. And shame on you, Clermont, for saying that "anti-gay values" are the teachings of Christ. I suggest you actually read the darn book before you begin to paraphrase it.<//review>

On Thursday, the first full day in office for San Diego’s new Catholic bishop, the Catholic University of San Diego (USD) hosted a “drag show” that the Vatican last year described as “scandalous.” Attorney Charles LiMandri, who founded Alumni for a Catholic USD and helped file a petition to the Vatican against the University’s annual cross-dressing event, spoke with The Cardinal Newman Society to discuss why USD is continuing to ignore the Vatican and even the recent words of Pope Francis.Last year, the Vatican’s Congregation for Catholic Education responded to the petition submitted by LiMandri and Thomas McKenna, founder and president of Catholic Action for Faith and Family. The Congregation’s letter deemed the drag show a “scandal” and declared its intentions “to act through administrative channels to the competent ecclesiastical authority in San Diego.” Whether under the guise of diversity or not, there is no excuse for a Catholic college to ignore the Vatican, LiMandri explained:

People that supposedly share our beliefs are grossly misrepresenting them and are getting a free pass. Even after they’ve been told by the highest authority [in the Catholic Church] that what they’re doing is scandalous—which in Church parlance has specific meaning—that you are leading people away from the faith, it is causing a potential loss of faith. The people who are in a position to represent the faith are giving a bad example. In this case it is not just a bad example, but it is a fraudulent message. They’re misrepresenting what the Church teaches, and you can’t get away with that under the guise of diversity.

Pope Francis addressed gender theory in his Wednesday audience this week, the day before the USD drag show:

As we all know, sexual difference is present in so many forms of life, in the long scale of the living. However, only in man and in woman does it bear in itself the image and likeness of God… Man and woman are [the] image and likeness of God!

… Modern and contemporary culture has opened new areas, new freedoms and new depths for the enrichment of the understanding of this difference. However, it has also introduced many doubts and much skepticism. For instance, I wonder, for example, if the so-called gender theory is not also an expression of a frustration and of a resignation, which aims to cancel the sexual difference because it no longer knows how to address it. Yes, we risk taking a step backward. The removal of the difference, in fact, is the problem, not the solution. To resolve their problems of relation, man and woman must instead talk more to one another, listen more to one another, know one another more, love one another more.

LiMandri hopes that USD might be a better example to these colleges.

“My goal and desire in a very personal way is to see USD come back into the fold like the prodigal son,” he said. “I love USD. I want to see USD be the best that she can be, that’s what is motivating me. I want to see USD get back on track, in line with the vision of its founders and what they profess in their mission statement.”

“These are good students who are being deprived of a good Catholic education,” he added. “When we get the word out and Catholics rally, good things can and do result.”

Until the University once again embraces the teachings of Christ, this gets one star.<//Text>

Visiting high school students need to be aware that USD will add you to their system(s).  My son visited USD in the Fall of 2012 and he just rec'd a "Final Notice of Non-payment".  He had 1 week to pay/resolve or it was going to be turned over to a collection agency.  He received no other notices.
Turns out he has a Student ID even though he never applied to USD.  All he did was visit.  There was a keystroke error in Housing and he ended up with a $5,000+ bill.  We are working to clear up the confusion but visiting high school students need to read all forms to understand what USD will do with your personal information.
I have requested a copy of their Privacy Policy - better read it very closely!</text>

<Text>Wow, so disappointed that they are not enforcing customers to wear a mask. A man who ordered a smoothie was not wearing a mask. He even sat down on the bench inside with NO MASK. They may have papers on the windows about their protocols, but they are not enforcing. I don't feel comfortable shopping here under these circumstances.< /Text>< Response>

Their terminator (ham/bacon/avocado) and grenade (turkey/bacon/avocado) sandwiches are amazing! They also have a TV on showing sports games like the Champions League and others. Only thing is that parking lot has small spots and the lot can get pretty busy at times.< /text>< pictures>

Saw the strip mall from the train station and went looking for lunch. A friendly employee asked if she could help me. I asked what brand of  pastrami they served. She said they get it from a large supplier that delivers. Couldn't chance the unknown pastrami. But, they didn’t serve corn beef, so I couldn’t make the classic deli meat combo anyway.

Ordered a hot sandwich with ham, dry salami, and cheddar on sourdough combo (2 meat + cheese selection, chips & drink total under $9.00). Received a sandwich with warmed bread (not toasted) and cool meat and cheese. The meat portion was on the small side, basically one slice of each, plus a pre-cut slice of cheese. The bread was more white than sourdough, but it was very fresh.

The combo comes with a choice from a large selection chips, and the soda selection is Coke brands.

Overall, it was above the usual convenience store fare. A good variety of choice of sandwiches and non-sandwich selections will provide a decent meal for anyone. The convenience store inventory provides make-your-own meal possibilities, if that suits you better.<//Text>

<Text>Great food!

I haven't had an issue with any of the staff, they are always very friendly. I usually stop by in the evening to wait out traffic and eat a nice sandwich.

Been coming here consistently for the past 3 years.<//Text><UserId.>104659016566920004382</UserId.>< date>

Great place to stop by for breakfast or lunch if you happen to be around Sorrento, I highly recommend it than other sandwich places around the area. I would have rated it 5 stars but lately when I order to-go lunch during my lunch break, I'm saddened to find out they forget an ingredient/produce, like my cheese almost every-time. Kind of brings down the mood.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc06fc6b348a91:0x778689f730477e3a< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Unexpectedly great food. The Deli is located in a small convenience store. It is family owned and operated. You might not expect much on first glance, but their food is top quality. Everything  we have had there is good and the variety offered is large. My go-to order is their club sandwich on squaw bread.</Review>

From the outside, it does not look like a place that has a damn good sandwich, but once you go in there, there are always a lot of people waiting/enjoying their sandwiches.   I am not very adventurous, as I mostly get the ATC (avocado, turkey, cheese) sandwich.  When I first started coming here, I would get the combo. This includes a small fountain drink of your choice from their Pepsi machine, and a small bag of chips.

Recently, I have been able to get only the sandwich and still be plenty satisfied.  I always call my order in from work, just up one exit on the 5 freeway, and then drive there and it's usually ready when I get there.  This is the most ideal way, as I have waited for my sandwiches a couple of times.

If you haven't tried this place out yet, I highly suggest that you do.  I am almost certain you will not be disappointed.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc06fc6b348a91:0x778689f730477e3a</Gmap_id></record>

Surprisingly good sandwiches for a place that looks like a second rate convenience store.  Locally known as "creepy deli".  Bottom line is you will get a good sandwich for a fair price.<//review>

<Review>Terrible Company as of late. Ordered 1600.00 of equipment on May 28th, Order was never delivered on June 3rd as told it would. FedEx has yet to receive a package to deliver to me, as show on the tracking information, they only received a Label creation request from DJI. DJI refuses to cancel my order stating it is in ship mode (as it has been for 17 days. DJI is refusing to refund me my money. What a nightmare!  Don't get involved with them.... They have recently laid off most of their US operations employees, which I am sure that their financial woes probably has something to do with this.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Worse company and zero customer service . I would fire everyone one that works in the customer service department.  Not worth buying anything from these guys!  I bought a new drone that didn’t work and it took 6 months to replace a complete drone and I get half one back.  No controller. No battery, no nothing. TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS< /Review>< pics>

<Review>CARE REFRESH IS A LIE - Don't buy DJI, per chinese law all their data goes right to the Chinese government/military.  And they don't honor their agreements - I used to be a customer, but after a flyaway (with DJI care refresh coverage!) they didn't do anything.  Am suing DJI for the cost of my drone.  go Skydio.  Better drone, US made, not feeding the enemy data.<//Review>< date>

<Text>While I acknowledge there are countless numbers of negative reviews about DJI's Customer Service, I can only speak of my own personal experience with an unbiased and honest review. As you'll see in my screenshot, it took exactly 7 days from the time I a) crashed my brand new Phantom 4 Pro, b) filed an online request for repair and c) paid my $99 DJI Care Refresh Express payment until the time my replacement P4P was being shipped back to me. That alone is perfect. The standard UPS Ground amounted for the entire replacement time with transit to DJI from Florida taking exactly 7 days (Mon-Mon). Upon my contacting of DJI via their North America toll-free number, I spoke to several people (all of whom spoke clear/casual English) over the course of several different calls (all of which turned out to be wholly unnecessary), DJI has came through for me like a lighthouse in the dark by shipping my P4P back to me 2nd day air via UPS! From the gut wrenching, gimbal snapping crash to the 9 day turnaround performed by DJI's outstanding Customer Service department, I have personally experienced 5+ STAR service from DJI and I am more than impressed. Thank you DJI for doing everything that you said you would do (and more!) and for continuing to improve in so many areas.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>For me the service was great. I was kind of worried after reading the reviews but now that it is all said and done they did a great job. Fixed my Mavic air 2 for free even though I did not have any warranty or anything. From what I can tell they just replaced it with a new model. They only had it in there shop for about 2 weeks which I would say is not to bad. Almost every day they sent me an email telling me what they were doing. I had great experience with Dji so hopefully they are getting much better customer service.< /Review>< pictures>

I was very skeptical on sending in my drone after it crashed and the gimbal was removed from the original position. I bought the DJI Care Refresh package as well when I bought the DJI Mavic Air 2, so I felt a little better about sending it in.

I was also on a quick timeline because I was moving out of town and needed to to have the drone back in a matter of two weeks.

With all that being said, once you get your case number, you can check the status of your drone and the repair process. Within the first day, I received a notice that they were assessing the damages.

The next day, I received a report of the damages.

The next day, I received an invoice to pay for my replacement drone ($69) for the first replacement with the DJI Care Package.

Then, received my drone the following Monday. So it was a one week turn around. I might've even received that Friday. I can't remember.

However, I am writing a very different review and I was very happy with how they followed through with the DJI care refresh package and also the turn around time. So thank you DJI!<//Text>

The drone I purchased was sent months late, had to be fixed before I could even work, and I was able to fly it a handful of times before the $200 battery had problems. No solutions were offered other than to upgrade the firmware, which then caused a problem with the landing gear. Thousands of dollars later, I have an absolutely worthless piece of equipment.<//text>< username>

This company is the worst.  Dishonest and sleezy.  Does anyone know their agent of service so I can service them legal documents to sue them?

They have major software issues that are causing drones to loose connectivity and force land over water, refusing to return home.  This has happened to several people including myself from one store alone.  I am trying to sue them but they will not provide their legal contact.  Chinese have become a very dishonest race as this is one example for a flawed culture.</Text>

Sent my DJI Mavic Mini in for repair (gimbal disconnected and arm broke). I was worried the superglue I put all over the arm to try a self repair might get me in trouble but they didn't even mention it. The entire refresh process was quick and without issue. Thanks DJI<//Review>

This is by far the worst company to do business with. They are simply a greedy Chinese company.

Please support American drone manufacturers who know how to support their customers!< /Text>

I have read the bad review about this place, and I can't hide that I was really worried to send my controller for repair there, after DJI told me to do so, following a fan buzzing noise in it which needed to be fixed, still under DJI warranty.

I sent the controller to this repair center around Christmas 2018, and got it back on 01-05-2019. And guess what ? They didn't repaired the controller, but sent me what appears to be a new one (or at least nice refurbished one) instead !!

So no complain there, and instant good review from me as well !!< /Text>

AWFUL! My controller was bricked. Sent it in under warranty after hours of wasting my time on the phone with techs who literally know less about the product than I do. After a couple of weeks, my new controller came in and guess what. It ALSO didn't work. Great QC, DJI. After wasting more time with tech 'support', I was told I'd have to send this one back too! The best thing they could offer me was expedited shipping on my THIRD controller. Do you think they followed through? Nope! All of the talk is true. DJI is sorely lacking in customer service and quality control. What a shame. They clearly have great engineers and marketing. Everything else is garbage. Once they have your money, they no longer care.<//Text>

<Review>I was skeptical before sending my unit in after reading the reviews but,  my experience with the actual repair facility has been totally amazing and fast!   They got right on it and I was able to track on their website each step of the process!  The repair has been made, the cost was covered under the one year manufacture warranty (Including shipping!), it is has been tested and is now in the last phase (Quality Control) before being shipped back to me.  Less than 2 weeks including shipping!!  The call center, more than likely in the Philippines could use more training.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd35af00000001:0xe5cde01d62d56d57<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Overall it was a good experience.  Once you start a request for repair, they take forever to send you a shipping label.  I waited a week after calling several times to check on it.  Once they received the drone, it didnt take them very long to get me my drone back.</Review>

Immediately after updating the firmware on my drone it flew off into a tree. The entire Flight after firmware update was about 10 seconds. I hit launch the drone went up 3.9 ft and it rocketed forward full speed into a tree giving all kinds of sensor warnings as it did so. I sent in the device for warranty support that I paid $149 for when I purchased the drone. After 14 days I got an email requesting my flight records because all the data on the Drone is corrupt. They will not cover the repair because I wont jump through their hoops to supply data for a 3rd time. They want me to download multiple programs to do this and register accounts on non DJI websites to upload the data. The drone Keeps records on an internal SD card and All the flight records are synced to there server from my device. I called customer service to discuss it and they said figure out a way to provide records or they will send me an invoice for the repairs. Clearly If all the data on the drone is corrupt there is a software issue. DJI Should honor this repair but they will not. And they are not even willing to discuss it. I would stay far away. DJI Go app is junk. It freezes and force closes constantly and their customer service is a joke. Go with another company for your Drone needs. Lucky for me there was a tree in the way and it didn't kill someone. 40MPH at 3.9ft. No apology no Sympathy and no one who speaks clear English.< /Text>

They don't stand behind their product, and their practices are deceptive.  Tech support played dumb about an issue so they could string me along until my warranty ran out.  If you were also wronged by these guys, please consider filing a complaint with the FTC/Consumer Protection Bureau.  If they get enough complaints, they'll go after them.  You can file against DJI CA and also do an international complaint against their headquarters.< /Text>

Do NOT do business with this company!!!
We bought the DJI OSMO ACTION and at first glance, it was awesome. The picture was beautiful, the device easy to work with and a totally unintrusive piece of equipment... WHILE IT WORKED which was exactly 5 days or so :( So I tell myself, "these things happen sometimes", I have a warranty plus additional insurance. Easy Peasy right? NOPE!  Firstly I'm in Italy, which I needed the equipment for AND I can't send the malfunctioning device back til I return to the states IN TWO WEEKS!  But I start the process of dealing with the issue online... I figure out quickly that thats not gonna work so I wait to get back home.
I finally begin with what winds up being a barrage of phone calls only to finally connect to DJI's HORRENDOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE Representatives. Truly the worst I've ever experienced and that is saying a lot.  The Customer Service Rep is asleep, uncaring and super slow and by now I am super frustrated because it has taken me many tries to get them on the phone. I'm talking MANY dropped calls disconnects, or the sound of someone answering and hanging up without saying hello. They simply don't care which in this day and age of Social Media and bad reviews equals to the death of a company! I finally put in a ticket for repair as per their instructions, send the camera back immediately and it takes forever to come back. When it does, ITS BROKEN but in a different way.. They fixed whatever bug it had before and then BROKE the camera speaker :O  SOOOO since this equipment was bought for a work/vacation out of the country, where we were when it stopped working and with two more weeks to go, I was NOT happy!!! I call back, ask to speak to a Supervisor and I'm told by the very bored customer service rep that the Supervisor is not available and that I would receive a callback in 24 -48 hours. When I asked why it took them so long to respond to the customers keeping them n business, he responded that actual company "Protocol" was that supervisors "DO NOT" actually speak to customers. Wait... WHAT? When I repeated that back to him as a question he tried to back track. He repeated that he would put the request in and ask the supervisor to call me BUT that there were MANY others before me waiting for a call as well... Needless to say my camera is still broken and I am waiting for a phone call I do not have a lot of faith in getting. OH and did I mention this had been going on for 2 months now!!!?!!
Buy yourself a GO PRO and skip the DJI Experience of not caring enough for the customers that keep in business!<//text>

BUYER BEWARE!!! THIS COMPANY WILL RIP YOU OFF!! I PURCHASED A DEFECTIVE DRONE LAST SEPTEMBER. AFTER SENDING IT BACK AND FILING A DISPUTE WITH MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY DJI REFUNDED ME. THEN A MONTH LATER THEY REVERSED THE REFUND EVEN THO THEY HAVE THE PRODUCT. THE ONLY WAY TO CONTACT ANYONE IN BILLING AT DJI IS THROUGH EMAIL WHICH THEY NEVER RETURN. I EVEN HAD MY BANK CONFERENCE CALL THEM AND EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND THAT INFACT DJI DOES OWE ME A REFUND AND THEY LITERALLY TOLD US THE BILLING DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE NUMBER THAT EVEN A MANAGER AT DJI CAN CALL. TOTAL BS!! NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THEM TO COURT TO GET MY MONEY BACK. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!! THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIFIC AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THROUGH TO ANYONE. NOTICE THAT THEY WON'T LET CUSTOMERS LEAVE REVIEWS ON THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE AND TOOK DOWN THEIR OTHER GOOGLE BUSINESS PAGES BECAUSE OF ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. THAT SHOULD TELL YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS COMPANY!!< /Text>

<text>DJI defective auto land system is dangerous and damages property, DJI is not taking responsibility
I haven't flown my phantom in a long time, so I went ahead and updated all firmwares(battery,drone,remote control), I then calibrated the drone compass and started my flight. I'm just outside of class Delta and that is where my property is, but for some reason the drone asked me to acknowledge that I'm responsible for the flight in a controlled air space, So i acknowledged and continued on the flight, suddenly the drone started auto landing and the abort button grayed out, it was going to land on people's property I managed to steer it away from that but the drone wouldn't stop descending and finally hit a tree and then the ground, At that point i had no control over the drone's altitude what so ever. DJI refused to fix it and they want me to pay $380 to fix a phantom 3 advanced that as of today 03/18/2019 can be bought for 200-300 new from many retailers. DJI said it is not under warranty, well yeah it is not but when A car company discovers takata airbag issues in their cars they didn't refuse service because a car is out of warranty. DJI auto landing taking over like this and leaving the pilot helpless and not in control causes a hazard on people and property and could seriously harm or injure people. I totally lost my drone in pieces because of something DJI APP did when it took control of my drone. DJI refuses to admit responsibility and will not fix my drone or fix the issue in their app.</text>< pictures>

Had to send in a Drone for repair, due to their screw up. I asked numerous times to have it sent back by air, and I would pay for it. I was assured they would take care of that request. I even have it in writing. But, what did they do, they shipped it by ground, the slowest way possible. Do not buy DJI</text>

<Text>Avoid DJI drones. Their customer service & repairs are horrible.  18 month old drone and the controller is acting oddly. When temp is below 80 degrees shows 3 leds on the controller when fully charged, take it into any area with temp above 85 and only 2 of the 4 leds light up when the batttery is fully charged. When you plug it in all four leds should flash while it charges mine has only two flash.  Called, did chat, and even spoke with someone via Facebook.  Their official reply is to send it in for professional diagnosis (for a fee) and they will quote the repair.  A quick internet search shows this is a common problem.  Additionally nearly every update causes problems with the drone.    Buy from a company that supports their product.  May sell my DJI drone and buy. Parrot anafi.<//Text><rating>1</rating>< user_name>

<Text>9 calls 15 hours on the phone in total.  Promised a call back every call and never received one. Sent my vision 2+ in a month ago.  Video feed went out after firmware update.  They sent me a repair invoice for over $200.  Refused to pay as multiple items they stated needed replacement I know were not broke because I just had it apart.   Something is being shipped currently.  I will see what arrives in the mail this week.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Regardless of what DJI support may tell you on the phone, you cannot drop off your repair items here. I found out the hard way after spending way too much time stuck in traffic trying to get there. The door is locked and s security guard will shoo you away, pronto.< /review>

Buyer beware! After cable, DJI is about as worst as it gets. They will not honor their warranty whatsoever and will turn the table to tell you that it's your fault. I received a dead battery out of the box and instead of giving me a new battery, I was blamed for not charging the battery every month.<//Review>

Agree with the other reviewers... DJI Refresh / service is a borderline scam.  Worst customer service experience I've ever had, endless lies, dropped calls, sending me broken products.  If I had more time I'd file a fraud complaint with authorities.< /review>

I have had several issues with DJI customer service.  My Phantom 3 Advanced remote control keeps having issues updating, after sending in two different remotes and 4 months later, I still am not able to use my drone.  It has been collecting dust, and upon asking for status, they are quick to reply that they have approved the replacement but are awaiting shipment, which has been over a month now.  I foolishly purchased a new drone (2 months into this process) and ordered some extra blades which were supposedly in stock, however it has been 3 weeks now since I placed the order and I still have not received even a shipment notification.  Upon trying to contact customer service again, they told me the order would be shipped by October 4th.  It has been over a week now and still no shipment.  Worst customer service.  Please be aware of this when you purchase any DJI product, warranty turnaround times can take MONTHS, and correspondence is very spotty.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!< /review>

Saw a racoon in-person for the first time in my life so I was excited. I love this Sanctuary's mission and what they do. Really loved the tour and learning about the what we can do to live more mindfully with our wildlife and I love the services they offer as well. Very interested in buying an owl box from them when I have my own house someday.</Review>

Thank-you so much for coming to pick up a sick injured raccoon so quickly.  I called 5 different animal organizations before a friend referred me to your wildlife rescue.< /Text>

Great for kids. You have to call first to make an appointment to visit. Interesting and and informed guide gave us a great tour. Took questions and comments from all including my eccentric 9 year old who tends toward rambling stories. Great time and good information about Sonoma county wildlife.<//text>

<pics>None</pics><text>Our experience with Sonoma County Wildlife Rescue was bad from beginning to end. We brought an injured squirrel. From the person who did the intake on our squirrel to receptionist who informed us about his death, nobody there showed or expressed any care or compassion. We loved this little squirrel, but to your team, it was just another squirrel. I'm sure you do amazing work, but your staff needs training on how to interact with customers and with the public. I come from a solid customer service background, and your team needs a lot of work. Very disappointed.<//text><response>None</response><user_name>Patrick Dirden</user_name>< GmapID>

I had a followup call the next day with a status - without care for her shock, that raccoon probably would have died.  These folks make a difference.<//Text>< Rating>

Great job!  A staff member came out and captured/rescued an injured fox.  She was very concerned about the trauma on the fox in coaxing it out from under my deck.  She finally crawled under my deck and captured the fox with her hands wearing heavy gloves.  Unbelievable!  I have donated to the website.</Text>

Rude, Obnoxious, Condescending...extremely unhelpful.  Called for a possible rabid animal...took 3 hours to get back then gave me a ration of guff both the emergency line and the person there.  Needs to be defunded and animal rescue moved to a responsible county agency with oversight...they claim no one is in charge....audit time?</Text>

At first so was disappointed with the portions of this to go meal, but was surprisingly full when it came down to the last tortilla that came with it. This dish is very spicy and so good! The only issue I had was the shrimp tasted like chalk as it wasn’t fresh.<//text>

<Review>Tried their menudo for the 1st time today. I'm  picky about my menudo.
I can say it was delicious. It comes with onion,  cilantro,½lemon, dried chilies and 4 small handmade corn tortillas.  Service was great. Courteous and quick. Price was good.</Review>< rate>

Great little place, service with a smile.  I asked for something that was not on the menu, and he (Rohelio) (now my tocayo) happily whipped right up!<//review>

< Review>
The homemade tortillas were excellent! The ceviche was great too! In fact we ordered multiple items from the meñu in order to critique the place fairly. The only bad review I’d have is that the orchata was too sweet. We had a great meal, thank you.<//Review>

There's nothing like washing your own car.Except when you set the rinse for no water spots and you start drying it to your surprise water spots.Not all have the same outcome, hopefully they will make the proper adjustments & all will work as it should.< /Text>

Oh boy, 8 minutes go by really fast.
I drive an Expedition, so being that it's a big vehicle washing it does take time. I opted for the five dollar option, which gave me 8 minutes in which to wet/soap, brush and rinse the car, but that wasn't enough time to get it done. I added to more minutes by inserting a dollar, and that seemed to do the trick.
The equipment worked well. I really like the fact that you can now pay with bills and credit card. The soap was plentiful and the water pressure was enough to remove all the grime from the crevices.
Great price. Great experience.< /Text>

I won't come here again.  Ended up costing me more than if I just had it detailed by someone else because you only get 4 minutes per $1 on the vacuum.  For washing, its even worse - about 4 minutes for every $5.  Also, the place was covered in tar which got on the inside of my car as I was vacuuming.</review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Best auto repair shop in Fresno. You get the best service and honest service. I have been going to Deep’s since 2007 and never go anywhere else. If repairs are coming up, he will let you know in advance so I can save up. Always gives an honest opinion. Thank you for your services over the years and for taking such good care of my cars.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80945f4329e2242b:0xaf87900caf24d51c< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

These guys are very good & friendly.
You can take your vehicle back and they will fix it if something didn't go right.  They are kind of on the high side cost but it's worth it, very dependable< /text>

< review>
Good mechanics are hard to come by and trust worthy ones are rare.  Despite all the negative comments I took a chance and stopped by Deep's to have my wife's hub bearings replaced on her 2012 Honda Civic due to the shops proximity to my home.  On June 26 I stopped by and spoke with Bee to get a quote.  Despite exceeding his closing hour of 5:30PM, Bee stayed open and helped me obtain a quote.  He even had one of his repair techs take my wife's vehicle out for a test drive.  On June  27 my wife dropped off her car at 8AM and I received a call from Deep's at noon stating that my wife's car was ready for pickup.  My experience with Deep's Auto Repair has been nothing but positive.  From their willingness to staying the extra hour to help, to their fast turn around, I will surely be using their services in the future.  Also, as a side note, their charge for the repair was lower then other shops that I had called.  Thank you  Deep's.< /review>

I don't drink much but it looks like this place has a nice selection I go in for the occasional bottle of milk butter something food-wise. Great crew always good to run there for a pinched if I need to pick something up large selection of almost everything I feel like I'm in a mini grocery store. With a lot of booze lol.< /Review>

<Review>The owners are great, but the cashier they had working was very rude I told him I was given a different price for an item and instead of saying you know I'm sorry but this is the price it is he was completely rude about it as though I was trying to get it for cheap I still got the item but was very disappointed at how rude this person was I don't think I'm going back there if he's working.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I hadn't been to the doctor in over 6 years. That's a good thing! I hadn't been sick!  I was  kind of nervous and Mrs Caroline was just amazing ... kind loving caring and she became like my friend. I had a marvellous visit and walked out happy. Although I will return in 1 month after lots of blood work. I knows she will walk me through my results. Until then I'll be praying. Thank you. I have always had a pleasant experience with Living Water.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Carolyn was very professional and not only listened to my expressions of frustration with the pain I had been experiencing but explained what she believed was occuring that was causing the pain. I was very pleased with the compassionate care I received.< /Text>

I had a great appointment over the phone with Mrs. Diaz.  She remembered some vital things that we needed to complete.  She is very professional and knows me well.  I am glad to be working with such a supportive person when it comes to health and wellness.< /Review>

<Text>The amazing, fabulous, and beautiful Lea Salonga performed at the Soraya in front of a packed house this week. With every seat virtually filled with fans, Lea Salonga gave an enjoyable performance. Some of her song choices included songs her mother and brother chose. Other song choices were recommended by her manager “Josh.” Although Lea Salonga has a truly “beautiful voice” and she is an “amazing performer,” a few songs choices (not made by Mom and brother) should be reconsidered.

After the show, Lea Salonga was kind enough to sign autographs for her fans. Fans were running to line up in long lines in anticipation to see her and to get their memorabilia signed. Despite waiting in line 40 minutes after the show ended to see Lea Salonga, everyone waited patiently.

I highly recommend seeing Lea perform if and when she returns to the Soraya! The Soraya is a beautiful venue and it was another evening to remember. ✅

Previous review: Bravo! Singing in the Rain at the Soraya was fantastic, riveting, and captivating!! Every scene, every character, and every moment was entertaining. This was the best show we’ve see all year and we’ve seen 5+. If you get the opportunity to watch Singing in the Rain today (Sunday), grab tickets while they last. The cast of Michael Starr, Kimberly Immanuel, Brandon Burks, and Sara King were amazing. There were too many great scenes to mention, however, Michael Starr actually singing in the rain on stage is a must see!!! Jamie Torcellini and Peter Van Norden were great too, adding the right amount of humor and fun. Let’s not forget the rest of the cast, crew, and supporting staff that brought the show home! Go see **Singing in the Rain**

As for the Soraya, it’s the photos speak for themselves! We’re glad such a venue was established at CSUN. ✅<//Text>< UserId.>

Lovely modern performing arts venue on the beautiful campus of Cal State University Northridge. Every seat in the house offers a spectacular view of the stage. Acoustics are great.

Two critiques
1. The parking garage is a bit of a walk to and from the venue
2. The seats are very long, meaning the bottoms were nearly the entire length of my thigh. This left my feet barely touching the floor (I’m 5’6”) and the space between rows is not long enough to cross your legs without disturbing the person in front of you.< /Text>

We came to see Selma with live music from Jason Moran, who wrote the soundtrack. The woman who made the movie, Ava DuVernay, came to speak, and they had the New West Symphony, conducted by Cheche Alara. There was an exhibit with photos before the show, and the entire production was wonderful. The Soraya is a beautiful building and they host beautiful events. They have valet options for parking, and there is also $8 parking, and free parking on the street, a short walk away.</Text>

I just saw the musical singing in the rain and it was wonderful. The theater is great and it's a wonderful addition to both Cal State Northridge and the San Fernando valley and the whole area north of there. Recommend this place and you should always go.</review>

Great acoustics. A beautiful, well organized, pleasant venue. Unusually comfortable seats. Many modern theaters have humming air circulating systems. Not this one. No distractions. A remarkable building for a serious musical experience.</Text>

<Review>As a theatre... there's not a lot to complain about.  CSUN is a non-smoking campus.  Good for some.  No so for my friend.
Parking is easy. It's a university, so it's designed to handle traffic. I have no qualms about ever going back for another event.</Review><userid>110633435381552730151< /userid>< pics>

I'm so glad such an amazing venue opened up here in the Valley.  My wife and I have gone to handful of shows here every year and have been disappointed.  First, the venue is a work of art.  It's beautiful on the outside and gorgeous on the inside.  The acoustics inside the theatre are fantastic.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  We saw La Santa Cecilia there last year and La Marisoul went acoustic for a song and could hear her clearly in the back of the theatre.  Second, they have amazing shows!  From the aforementioned La Santa Cecilia/La Marisoul to the Aspen Santa Fe ballet to David Sedaris to W Kamau Bell, they really book a variety of fantastic shows and artists.  It really is a treat to have such a fantastic venue just minutes from our house.<//text>

<text>The show and the venue were nice but beware ITS A TRAP!

We drove over 100 miles to see a show on a Saturday night. We followed the signs and parked where we were told to catch a shuttle to the venue. Lo and behold upon returning we had a ticket for not having a parking permit. There were no signs that said we needed a permit?!  We are not students at Cal State Northridge. The website for the Soraya even said to park where we parked. I called and I contested and I got nowhere.   I talked to multiple people. I filed their paperwork to contest. Even though this occurred months ago I am still outraged.  Nice little revenue generating scam they have for the patrons of this venue.

Thanks for an enjoyable event. 100$ later ☹️<//text>< pictures>

The building is beautiful. The handicap parking is horrible! I came to watch a performance. The handicap parking requires a CSUN parking permit. The Kiosk asks for a spot number however it does not exist. So how am I supposed to pay for the $8 permit. By the way, I'm only staying for 3 hours for the show why $8?<//Text>

<review>Although I wish the VPAC didn't sell out to the highest bidder and change its name to something so foreign, many of the shows are still very good. They are not bringing in top names since it became the Soraya, but the musicals are always excellent.< /review>< Pics>

My wife and I were season ticket holder"s. We had ticket's to see Billy Porter perform Richard Rodgers music. We never heard of Billy Porter but if it was Richard Rodgers music it had to be good that was wrong. It turn out to be a political protest  lectures about Gays and Blacks civil rights political protest .I believe in everyone civil right. But  I payed  to be entertained not lectured. The information was miss leading nothing was said that it was a protest or raping. Next season we will not purchase season tickets.   Jerry Lucero<//Review>

<review>Parking fines are a revenue source for this venue. Parking, while seemingly plentiful, is unmarked with little guidance on an event night. Fines are $49. You roll the dice when attending an event here.<//review>< date>

Excellent building and acoustics for classical music.  I have been slowly giving up driving all the way to Disney Hall, so it's nice to have a high-quality performance hall nearby.  Not only that, the music is a little more interesting that the Thousand Oaks Civic Center, where I have season tickets.</text>

There is another performance room as well as the main hall.

It is quite a walk from the parking structure to the hall. They say there is a transportation service for those who have trouble walking, but we did not see it the last time we were there The parking used to be $5, but parking is now included with your ticket to a performance. You can be dropped off at the front door and there is attendant parking for an additional charge.</Text>< pictures>

I like the fact that we got to go free into pretty good seats to hear a Classical Music Orchestra. The place is really up scale so if you go dressing fancy is a must. It's a very pretty place.

What I Didn't Like:
However during the Classical music orchestra I had to use the restroom and after I used the restroom the staff wouldn't let me back into the theater. They said that I would be disturbing other people if I walked back in. I pleaded with the staff saying my mom is worrying for me. Eventually a man sat me to the balcony seats. I waited patiently until he left then I went to my seats!< /text><response>None< /response>< Pictures>

I have been lucky enough to attend a few shows and presentations at the Valley Performing Arts Center (VPAC). It is a state of the art and elegant venue on the CSUN campus. It is not a large but a decent sized venue with each seat having a great view of the stage.

Each show is professionally staffed with individuals that assists you with finding your seats and to answer any questions you may have. They are also there to enforce the no flash photography policy during shows.

For those of you who live quite a ways from the venue, you will have the option at staying at the Hyatt hotel that will be built right across the street from the VPAC in the near future. The hotel will open in mid 2019.<//Text>

<Review>we saw peter and the wolf performed by the pacific symphony orchestra.  nancy cartwright narrated.  great show for the little ones.  brought our 3 and 5 year old.  they had a good time for a 1.5 hour show which was just right.  and they played copland's hoe down at the end which I adore!  the kids then had a blast running around outside of the theatre.  beautiful performing arts space on CSUN's campus - really a great place in the valley.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate><user_id>109904582836523552521<//user_id>< gmap_id>

<gmapID>0x80c29a53e6cc26e1:0x9050744ee1c73a4b</gmapID><pics>None<//pics><text>The parking situation at this facility is beyond atrocious....by far, the worst at any venue in the LA area.  And if you have any physical limitations,  your handicap placard is basically useless unless you decide to show up 3 hours in advance.  I attended an event at the Valley PAC on 9/30 and one at the Hollywood Bowl on 10/1 and the difference in the parking between the two venues is stark - at VPAC, we had to walk at least 3/4 of a mile to & from the car (since i was on crutches,  i only had to do this once, but my partner had to park the car, walk the length of the parking lot to get to the kiosk to pay for parking, walk BACK to the car to put the parking receipt on the dashboard, then walk it AGAIN to get to the theater,  then again after the show - outrageous), whereas at the Bowl (where there is generous handicap parking or the option to take shuttle buses directly  to the main entrance from anywhere in the greater LA area) we were in our car and on our way home in minutes.  And the event at VPAC maybe had 1,000 people in attendance, whereas the Bowl was sold out and 18,000 people were navigating the venue.  Not to mention the VPAC lot was virtually pitch black at night, making a terrible situation even worse due to the dangerous conditions.  Unfortunately we have tickets for another event at VPAC in two weeks - after that, God Himself would have to be on the bill before we'd consider returning to this place - with Streisand as His opening act.  And then only maybe.</text>< resp>
{'time': 1475880694992, 'text': "Thank you very much for your feedback. For the opening of our 2016-17 season, VPAC took a step backward in the implementation of new parking systems.  We apologize. This was not our intention, of course.  In the longterm, we're excited about the value and ease you will enjoy from parking as a service included in the price of your ticket purchase.  We must also follow the regulations of CSUN and the State of California in implementing this service, and we failed to work out the kinks in time.  Please know we've already made improvements, and there are more to come.  We handed out about 50 complimentary drinks to people who didn't have a good parking experience on Opening.  We hope you'll come back so we can apologize in person and buy you a drink too.  Finally, we encourage you to join our email list.  We disseminate important information about each concert, as well as other news and announcements, which includes your parking permit. We hope you allow us to provide you with a better experience the second time you are here."}</resp>

Okay - this is a, "Five Stars for Taco Bell" five star rating. I mean, 5 stars at Taco Bell is not the same as 5 stars at Ruth Chris. It's clean. Fast. Friendly service.<//text>

Well, I would leave a better review if the place hasn't been closed for a month and a half for remodeling. With no info about its reopening as a cherry on top. Thanks taco bell, oh yea, they also removed the chicken burrito. Bye bye Taco Bell, you lost a costumer.</review>

Double check your order before you drive away... every time. Quality of the food is great and the remodel is really nice.< /Text>

<Text>Fantastic donuts and great customer service.  I work at 6 am and can never get anything but fast food to eat. Found this gem of a place and was so thrilled.

I celebrated my PhD this evening in this gorgeous place. I am glad to say that we passed a cool evening and the place was unquestionably one of the reasons for that outstanding celebration. The waiters  collaborated in a very nice style, the food was very good and my guests were so  delighted. We shall no dout return for more joyful events. Thank you very much.</Text>

<review>If you are driving through, stop here! We plan our trip so we can get breakfast. Their breakfast sandwich is OF THE HOOK! Get it with two eggs over easy and grab some napkins! Burrito is amazing and the coffee (three different roasts to choose from) is gooood!< /review>< Date>

Terrible service, the store needs a major renovation and they can never seem to get orders right and They DONT answer the store phone and the entire management team sucks especially the District manager which is why the store sucks now

I waited at least 15 mins to be served cold cheese on a mini quesodilla and no one can explain why in the store yet they claim they cooked it as policy permits
Dont let them ask you to back up and pull forward again in the drive-thru because if an accident happens the store isnt technically liable
Oh and there is literally a new face everytime I go
They lost my patronage because they think that just because they are franchise they can do what they want and not have to answer to anyone
I dont patronize any Taco Bell locations due to the royal screw up of a store this location is from the District manager ALL the way down< /text>

We told 2nd  person at drive thru we did not get straws 3 times. He kept shoving food out on a tray saying everything was in the bag. After exiting we looked and they were NOT there. Had to go back, knock on door, and ask another employee for them.  The lady employees were nice and helpful but we felt the gentleman needed more customer service training.< /Text>

One of the better taco bells. Great friendly staff and do a good job on fixing your food. Unlike allot of places that you can tell how they fell by the way they assembled your food.< /Review>

This was an absolutely amazing buffet! Each member of the staff was incredibly welcoming and my party and I could not have any complaints about them.

There is a plethora of cuisines to choose from: chinese, korean, italian, american, vietnamese, japanese, tuscan (?), etc. There are so many different types of salads and fresh pressed smoothies for all of my health gurus.< /Review>

Let's be honest guys, it's fast food. We've had good experiences here and really, really cruddy ones. Service is very hit or miss and the food follows. The dining area is usually clean. The restrooms are ok.< /review>

delicious as usual, this location particularly is very consistent with quality, speed and friendliness. I love Taco Bell, the cheesy gordita crunch is my favorite item hands down and has been for years. Don't get me wrong I eat the other items as well and I like to try the new ones here and there but I always find myself going back to the Gordita Crunch.🤔< /Review>

This Taco Bell establishment is pretty much what you would expect. Generally, they do a great job of getting orders correct. At times they can be under-staffed and orders can take a while but it's a decent location.<//Text>

Honestly the worst taco bell I've been to. Terrible quality control. We go in every once in a while if I dont feel like cooking dinner and there is ALWAYS something wrong with the order. The food is always lopside (meaning the ingredients are not throughout the item, such as a crunchwrap having all the meat at the bottom, lettuce tomatoes in the middle and sour cream/cheese on top?) Its to the point I dont even order a crunchwrap anymore, that's not the only item this happens with but just an example. I've gotten a simple soft taco and gotten home to realize there was no meat, only cheese and lettuce... the one thing I can say is that the workers work FAST. But once you get your meal it's literally slopped together, and all thrown into ONE bag...so everything is squashed anyway. You dont put a grilled stuff burrito on top of crunchy tacos and a gordita... it makes at least half the meal inedible. We just wont come anymore, it's not worth being disappointed and having to find something else to eat anyway. Save your time and money.</Review>

<Review>There was hardly any chicken, and cheese on it and I was not impressed. I've had Taco salads before at other Taco Bells and they were far better than the one I got...<//Review>< Pics>

Has the worst food ever!! If you want it fresh than plan on eating there so if it tastes like it was made in the morning you can take it back!!! Why don't the managers care??? Make the food when it is ordered!! Put some meat in the dam tacos. I had to also add extra cheese to my casadias !! Wow!! Please let this town get some better fast food!!</text>< resp>

Really hit and miss. In the afternoons the majority of the time, the foods going to taste terrible. At nights you're going to have that taco bell you've been craving. Definitely an issue with management.</text>

<Review>Havent even left the store yet and my stomach hurts. The employes were rude. Took 15 min to get my food with only 2 other customers in the store. And i ordered a 5 layer burrito and still trying to figure out what it is. Never coming back.< /Review>< pics>

There was no one in line when I arrived and I waited 10-15 minutes to order but no one waited on me.  A worker did come out of the restroom and immediately went to the back.  There was a cook also.  I left without ordering.  I needed to write a review as this is the second time this same incident happened.  And to think, in a few years these workers will get $15.00 an hour!  Unbelievable.< /text>< rating>

<Review>Stopped in to get a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The cashier was not very friendly or helpful, which should have been my first clue. I ordered a box meal and sat down to wait, and boy did I wait. I waited for almost 25 minutes seeing others get their food and leave. I finally decided that maybe something wasn't right. I talked to the cashier who asked for my receipt and after going to the back came up and told me my order never went through. She never once thought to check on me or even apologize for anything. The only redeeming factor was that the manager was very apologetic, yet didn't offer any type of compensation for my wasted time. I personally will not be going back.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Terrible food terrible service. The worst fast food dump in the AV and quite possibly the entire state of California. If you value your tastebuds and your health, stay far far away.
Call in the HAZMAT team, bulldoze the place to the ground. The world will be a better place. ..</text>

This place is not only slow, it's disgusting.

On a recent Friday night a friend wanted some quick Taco Bell. As we pulled up, the drive thru was packed. So we went inside

The reason the drive through was so busy?

The only reason I could figure is, the place smelled like a bathroom! And in not a nice way. That smell when it seems like the sewer is backing up and coming out thru the toilet.

My friend commented about it to the counter person. She just looked at us with a blank stare.

How can a food prep place smell like a backed up sewer? I've been in porta pottys that smell better.

Perhaps the selection of fast food is slim to none in rosamond. But no way would I ever go back. Not even in the drive thru. Food served in a place that filthy is disgusting.

Pass.</review>

<text>Really like the food. always have to go back for napkins or hot sauce. After giving order your order is Repeated before your next word comes out. Usually wrong. You ask for Large mountain dew original. They ask baja blast. You say, no original. They repeat. At the window they hand you baja blast.  Never get full order, something missing. Very nice polite people though.< /text><user_id>115849262421216899960< /user_id>< Pictures>

Ayer estuve en su restaurante , y me demoraron en darme mi pedido mas de media hora y por dos burritos suprimi de pollo, y a demás cuando reclamé mi comida , la persona que estaba haciendo los burritos aseguró que me los había dado, que no era siertoo nunca me los habían dado, pues me los hizo de Mála gana  y me dio con cuatro piedritas de pollo en cada burritos que además cuestan cinco dólares cada uno me pareció muy caro por unos burritos de frijoles no mas</text>< pictures>
