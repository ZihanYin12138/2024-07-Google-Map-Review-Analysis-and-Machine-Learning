I am very great full and happy with the service of my legal team. They fought hard for me. Their hard work and belief in me got us a settlement. My lawyers strategy and unwillingness to settle for less got us our best outcome for my case. I could not be happier. All of the team members were a delight to speak with. They told me what was expected of me and what I needed to do to move my case a long. I recommend this law firm to anyone who needs help with a motorcycle accident case. Thank you, Robert</text>

While I don’t like to use Law Firms normally, I am glad my Wife contacted them while I was in the hospital, recovering after being hit by a car.
Mr. Chuck Koro and his amazing staff took care of my case, letting me concentrate on my medical treatment. They walked us through all the paperwork, insurance forms, lists of all my things that were damaged or destroyed.
Everyone from their office was friendly, professional and showed compassion. All were patient, understanding and when I asked questions they responded with the answer and the reason for the answer.
If you ever find yourself in need of a Law Firm, I highly recommend this one.
“Thank you”, to everyone who worked on my case.

I was involved in an accident and although they could not take on my case, Chuck has been very helpful answering a few questions, and guiding me through the process of resolving issues I’m having with the at fault driver/insurance company. He’s very knowledgeable, personable and professional. If you are in need of an attorney I highly recommend that you check them out.

I was injured in a motorcycle accident in January of 2020 where the other driver was at fault and decided to seek out representation for my case. My Mother has always said, ”When in doubt, hire a lawyer” and I am so very glad I did. Surviving and recovering from a traumatic motorcycle wreck is already a tall task but Mr. Shelby West and his team do their best to make it easier. How easy you ask? EASY. They told me that they would take care of everything and all I had to do was focus on recovery. So that’s exactly what I did. Straight from the get go, Mr. Shelby and his staff got all my ducks in a row, communicated with the other party’s insurance company on my behalf, and got me the settlement I deserved for my pain and suffering. I’m sure any good injury lawyer could’ve done the same but what sets Mr. Shelby and his squad apart from the rest, as cliche as it sounds, is that I truly felt cared for. Any question I had was answered with patience, every doubt I had was reassured away, and the regular calls to check to see how my recovery was progressing didn’t hurt either. Motorcycling will continue to be a huge part of my life and hopefully I won’t get hit again BUT if I do....the first call is 911...the 2nd is to Mr.Shelby West and his fantastic staff. Wrecks are an awful experience but it’s MUCH less awful with the right help.< /text>

Great service, personal, and responsiveness.  I couldn't be any happier with how the process was start to finish with Russ Brown and the outcome help they got me.

Checking in, updates, inquires were all done in a manner I'd expect from a firm specializing in motorcycles and would gladly recommend them to anyone that needs assistance.<//review>

The whole team worked diligently to help me get the highest compensation for an accident caused by a careless guy who ran a red light. Yvette & Daniel recovered 2x as much in damages, and my attorney, Nick, fought hard to make the insurance company pay up. Thank you to Liz, Jesha, and the whole staff, for being kind, patient, & understanding throughout the long process. There’s no way I could have done this alone and gotten this size of a settlement. For 2 years the insurance company kept dodging us, hoping I would fold. Now I see the importance of having a powerhouse team like, Russ Brown Motorcycle Attorneys, on your side. Thank you!</Text>

This was my first time dealing with this sort of thing, so I was little nervous because I didn't know what to expect. Everyone worked very hard to make the whole process was as simple for me as possible.

The day after I first called them, there was a representative at my house. He took the time to answer all my questions and made sure I understood everything. Throughout the process I was able to contact the office and speak with someone who was willing to help with anything I needed.

I really have to acknowledge Andrew for the awesome job he did representing me. Thank you all for your time and effort. I hope I never need you again but I'm keeping your number just in case.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I appreciate the hard work he put in fighting on my behalf. Should I ever get into another accident, I will definitely use Russ Brown and Andrew Myers :)< /Review>

As a person who never had need of looking for legal assistance and also as a person who was iffy about lawyers, I was left very impressed by the Attorneys at Russ Brown. Doing anything with lawyers was out of my comfort zone but these guys were recommended to me by a friend and I was convinced to go talk to them. From the very beginning, the staff was friendly and made me feel comfortable. Shelby took care of my case and he made everything simple to understand. Throughout the couple years that my case took, Shelby communicated with me, answered any questions, and explained everything clearly. He made me feel comfortable which is something anyone in a legal situation should want to feel. In the end, I was extremely happy with what Shelby and the whole team at Russ Brown did for me. They made my first experience with legal matters a breeze and unforgettable and would not hesitate to seek their assistance in the future.Thank you to everyone there!</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>After my accident, the CHP wrote their report which was completely contradictory to what I experienced and what I had told to the officer. The insurance company was not going to help me. Nick at Russ Brown believed me and not the report. It took almost two years of digging and research but they found the evidence that disproved the "official" report. The insurance company was finally convinced that I was in fact telling the correct version of the events that caused my accident. My case was won!

My husband hired them after his motorcycle accident and they did everything BUT fight for him. Chuck Koro lowballed his case at mediation and then basically told us if we are not happy with their services, we can find another attorney. Who does that at a mediation?? After all the trauma my husband experienced, he just wanted to put the whole thing behind him and then his so-called attorney tells him that! Anyone who knows about a lawsuit knows it’s hard to find another attorney when the case is close to settlement. THEY SUCK AND ARE WEAK!!</text>

{'time': 1612226919724, 'text': 'We never had a client named Frank Strong…so our response to Anonymous is with general information.  If the reviewer is an actual client and revealed his or her real name, we could be more specific.\n\n#1) A 9-month settlement is fairly quick.  There is virtually no such thing as a slam-dunk in this business.  Even if insurance companies don’t fight on the fault issue, they will still fight on the value of the case.  Settling too fast will generally result in leaving money on the table.  Even after settlement, we negotiate to reduce medical bills, with that money going to the client, not us.  Insurance companies aggressively fight whether injuries were caused by the accident, the reasonableness of medical bills, the length and type of treatment, proof of loss of earnings, etc. They make every effort not to pay full value.\n\n#2) Surgical cases generally DO have high value, depending on the surgery and recovery. Unfortunately, when the adverse driver doesn’t have enough insurance and the client doesn’t have (or doesn’t have enough) Uninsured/Underinsured coverage, full value for the injuries and damages may not be recoverable. ALL RIDERS NEED UM/UIM PROTECTION! We recommend $250/500 or more if you can afford it.\n\n#3) We work just as hard on small cases as we do large ones.  Ensuring that every client receives the maximum recovery is our creed.  We understand how frustrating the process is--we live it every day.  But there is no other firm with more experience in motorcycle accidents than Russ Brown Motorcycle Attorneys, and no other firm that works harder for their clients.\n\n#4) Being “curt” does not speed things up.  However, it is always best to communicate honestly any concerns you may have with your attorney and/or the team handling your case.'}< /resp>

I have not had the need for a attorney yet and hope I never do. That said I was at a bike show today were I met some people from this firm. So I looked them up read some reviews and come to the conclusion that most of the unhappy people on here never got hurt so what do you need a attorney for? If you carry full coverage with a good company you don't need a attorney. I love my bike but it's still just a bike they make more.< /review>

{'time': 1578695122441, 'text': 'We understand Mr. Lake’s frustrations; however, his assertions are grossly inaccurate.  He had a significant injury and treated at the Veterans Administration.  Under these circumstances, VA treatment is not free. The VA is entitled to reimbursement for the treatment from his settlement. The law firm has a legal obligation to pay it.  If it doesn’t, it will be held responsible for the debt.  In this case the lien was $86,400 which we were able to reduce to just $7,500.  The other party only had $30,000 in insurance coverage. Contrary to Mr. L’s assertion, we did not know the policy limits before taking the case.  Once we found out, we let him know the same day. Mr. L was told how the insurance limits would impact his recovery.  It is important to point out that if Mr. L had sufficient underinsured motorist coverage under his own policy, we could have recovered more.  It is a mystery how he concludes that this is a top end result for us.  It is fact that we have resolved thousands of cases for exponentially more, recovering millions for our clients. Lastly, we did not take more in fees than his net recovery.  We took a contingency fee of one-third. For any other concerns or clarifications, we encourage Mr. L to reach out to us at 1-800-4BIKERS.'}< /Response>

I have to tell you I’m not a basher of businesses but hiring this company after I was hit on my motorcycle it was not a good experience for me. They do not fully disclose what the potential is when they already know upfront. In most cases they will only settle for $30,000 and out of that $30,000 you will not expect any more than $11,000. They do not want to show that they will collect more than you even though their fee is $10,000. You will be expected to pay the full medical bills of what they settle on out of your till nothing comes out of theirs. I even had free healthcare but because the accident happened they had to turn the free healthcare into full medical bills of $86,000 and settle it for $7500 to make them look like saints. My suggestion is to hire some crazy aggressive attorney do not hire these low fruit picking attorneys as you could probably negotiate a better deal yourself. Very bad experience here<//Text>

<response>{'time': 1528228169600, 'text': 'Unfortunately, “full value” for a totaled bike is rarely going to be the price that you paid for your motorcycle.  Mr. Mann was convinced his bike was worth more but neither of us could find one online source or local dealer to back up that opinion.  The insurance company based their offer on 3 dealer comps for the same or newer model motorcycle.  We put in the time to ensure that this was a fair offer by the insurance company, but the process does not allow for subjective valuation.  We don’t accept lowball offers;  however, to negotiate, you have to be able to provide proof that the community has a similar view-- such as online ads offering the same bike For Sale for a higher price, or perhaps a written valuation from a reputable dealer explaining why the insurance company’s offer is too low.  In Mr. Mann’s case, despite his desires and our best efforts, such proof was not obtainable.  We are one of only a handful of firms that do property damage claims as part of our service to our injured clients.  It is not a profit-making endeavor.  We do it because we realize how important it is to our clients.'}< /response><rate>1<//rate><Time>1528175837342<//Time><text>I had Randy come out and promise me the world so I could sign with them. He was likable and promised me the full value for my 3 week old, totaled bike and negotiations if I didn't like the price the insurance companies presented. Instead, what I got was a lawyer who I spoke to once in a 2 month's time period and Chloe, who seemingly hated her job and despised working with me as a result. She told me outright that Randy shouldn't have promised me full value and also stated this was just a "courtesy" when I told Randy exactly how important the property damage portion of my case was and wouldn't have signed if I had been told otherwise. She continued by saying, "you can always call the insurance company directly" if I didn't like their initial offer. WHAT AM I PAYING YOU FOR AGAIN??

The customer service is no where near where it should be when you're paying them thousands of dollars.

Horrible customer service is something that I can get over. But don't sell me on you delivering specific services and then outright break your word once you have me as a customer. I switched to another service because of a lack of integrity.

Pause for their defensive response to this criticism which will no doubt lack accountability thus proving my point about how they treat clients.</text>< name>

<text>I called this place thinking that they would be on my side. I got a investigator that was super aggressive with me because i didn't know the full details about my insurance coverage. I called them 3-4 weeks ago and till this day they have yet to reach out to me to let me know if i have a case. I sent them to Gopro video and still no reply. Don't waste you time with this law firm.  They obviously  have to much going on to focus on your case. Its been 1-2 months since my accident and still no help!!! RUSS BROWN USELESS!!</text>< Pics>

So about a year ago my friend and attorney Nick Gullette along with all the people at RussBrown attorneys got me a settlement for over a quarter million dollars!
Nick and his team  in only a few months put my family in financial security.
It changed my world, they are the best attorneys on the planet.
‘’ If you go down call RussBrown ‘’
My thanks to everybody at that office my last year has been a dream!....

I’ve been riding since I was 17 and I’ve seen Russ Brown everywhere. Never thought I’d need them but I was riding home from work when a truck made a left right in front of me. I ended up breaking my knee backwards needed metal plates and screws---I wouldn’t wish that pain on anybody. I worked with Chuck Koro and Marc Smith at Russ Brown motorcycle attorneys and they were very attentive to my needs and pretty much everything. It was a long process but they did their best to make sure I made it out OK in the end.</review>

<text>Russ Brown Motorcycle attorneys were true experts with all the details.  In November of 2014, I suffered a traumatic brain injury and torn brachial plexus along with other injuries that I had never heard of prior to my accident.  Not only were they truly caring professionals throughout the process, but they helped educate my family and I on my condition and the severity of it all – they’ve been doing this for years.  They even went out of their way to help me cope and understand the process while pushing for the insurance company to do whatever it is that those crooks do (all the while taking their sweet time).

My accident, along with the aftermath of my recovery, was nothing short of a nightmare as one can imagine.  Knowing that my lawyers, their crew and all of their top notch doctors that they referred me to was a very bright light during a pretty dark time in my life.  Chuck, Shelby, and all of their wonderful staff, are nothing short of pure class.  I’m a huge supporter of word of mouth and will 100% go out of my way to let people know that there still are businesses who thrive on helping people via acts of honesty, integrity and respect.  Simple stated, this office and all of the employees there are nothing short of pure class and will blow away your expectations should you put them to the test.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Almost 3 years ago I was in a MAJOR motorcycle accident.  We found Russ Brown Motorcycle Attorneys thru a friend that was involved in a accident.

Chuck Koro and his staff took our case.  Chuck would call me on average of 5 to 6 times a month just to see how I was doing and to give me updates on the case. He would touch base with me and Christine during my long recovery and then began the process of the law suit against the People Responsible for the accident.

My Medical Specialist and Chuck worked together to make sure that I was taken care of.

Chuck was patient answering all questions and concerns that we had. Chuck was very helpful on getting and staying in touch with my Medical Specialists. Chuck had no problem walking us hand in hand through out the entire process.

Chuck and his wonderful support staff were great in helping me get through the most difficult time of my life.

Chuck and his partners have over 75 years of experience handling motorcycle accident cases and it shows in their work ethic and professionalism.

I know that I have made a friend for life in Chuck and hopefully I wont need him as my attorney, but if I do, he is my FIRST CALL!!!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><username>Choppermike1969 Mr. B</username>< response>

Glad I called Russ Brown Motorcycle Attorneys---it was a good experience overall. Working with Marc Smith and the rest of the team there I felt like I was never left in the dark, if I had questions I knew I could always call and ask. Everyone there is helpful and informative. Marc told me outright what I should do and what to expect. Since my motorcycle accident the process took about two years—I was out of work for 7 months with a broken back, broken pelvis and several other injuries to deal with all at no fault of my own. My girlfriend recommended I call the attorneys at Russ Brown and I although I don’t have experience working with other lawyers, I’m glad they were the ones to handle my case.</Review>

<Text>I got into an accident about 2 years ago. I dislocated my shoulder and got my eye all cut up and bruised pretty bad. While recovering and out of work, my dad set me up with Russ Brown motorcycle attorneys. I worked with Marc and his paralegal Bonnie who was great and was always working to my benefit. She was good at explaining everything and I probably wouldn’t be able to recover if it wasn’t for her. Thanks to Bonnie, Marc and everyone at Russ Brown.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Chuck, apparently their boss, just fired me as a client and left me out to dry in the middle of the case.   He said at least two of his employees said I was rude to them on the phone.  Funny, when it was his employees who said they'd look into solutions for me, call me back with answers and days would go by or weeks and no call back.  Veronica had to look into possibly getting me a rental from the person at fault's insurance, but she never did call back with good news or bad news.  The person at fault's insurance inspector did come to my place to see my destroyed vehicle and mailed a proposal/payout offer to Russ Brown Attorneys on my behalf and I called to follow up after a week and a half after that and I was told by Russ/Brown attorneys that my folder had gone from their front of the office to the back/litigation back office.  They left me on hold for nearly 30 minutes last week and didn't call back until today, when someone new handling my case finally called back, Yvette who I am guessing heard me a bit unhappy and told Chuck I am the meanest dude without a reason.

So, property damage was taking too long (which they love saying "these things take time") - whatever that means, months? years?  If your back is out, unable to work and your vehicle destroyed, you can only say that to yourself so many times.   Usually, it would take Shelby, one of their attorneys, a few minutes before realizing that my case was a car case, not a motorcycle case.  And then he'd go get my file and begin catching up.  In asking Shelby what I could do since I was unable to work - "How does this work? - having an attorney, not being able to pay your bills/rent while this process takes place, please tell me if I have options"  Shelby said that because I did not crack my head or break a leg, loan sharks/people to like to dip into the cookie jar when there's an accident, would most likely not help me out.  1st time in my life I felt bad for not cracking my head wide open.

I called these people back after a motorcycle accident I had in 2015.  They quit on me that one time, I thought, because we were unable to find the girl who side swiped me off the road and we could not continue in court.   When I told Shelby that facebook had found that individual for me on "people you might know" - Shelby told me that they quit my case that one time because they realized the girl had nothing to go after.  By that, it felt like, not much money in it for them.

I was just really trying to get my vehicles repaired, have my back checked out and go on with life.  These people make that very difficult.  Consider other attorneys.

P.s.  Literally two minutes after Russ / Brown attorneys abandoned/quit my case for the 2nd time, my physical therapy doctor called me letting me know they had to cancel my entire therapy procedure because my former attorneys quickly called them.  So, you can get quick answers and solutions WHEN YOU WANT huh chuck?< /review>

<user_name>THe Wicked One<//user_name><rating>1<//rating><Text>They advertise that if you go down, they will help. Bu t not the case with me. I fell on my Hrley due to a road hazard,  I had pretty  bad damages to my bike. I called them and after reviewing my case , they pretty said they couldnt help since iIdidnt suffer sufficient  amount of injury. I was shoclked to hear that my accident was not good enough for them since I wasnt hurt enough!  Good looking out Russ Brown!! I ended up going after the city for my damages on my own and got myself a nice check to fix my bike and got more than I expected in my settlement. Do not give up, if you go down and they dont want to help , do it yourself!! After talking to them I felt bad and didnt want to purse anything, but I had to,it wasnt my fault. In the end it worked out for me.< /Text>< pictures>

Small crepe shoppe in San Jose's Japan town area.  Kids felt like a crepe so we decided to try it.  When you walk in the counter looks like a lunch truck setup with papers on windows separating thew door and customer area from the food prep space.  Monkey toys hang from an umbrella on the track lighting and the place feels... casually indifferent but whimsical in a kid's bedroom kind of way.  Seating was very limited.  The order was for a banana strawberry crepe and was fair but unmemorable.  A decent experience but standard fare in the crepe world by our taste buds.  Cash only so be prepared if you want to try this place out.</Text>

<Text>Friendly service and extraordinarily fair prices! Two beverages and two crepes can be had for for under $20. The sandwich flavor BLT crepe was delicious. So was the Hawaiian pineapple and ham one. There are a few tables inside. The fun decorations give the shop a homey feel. Would definitely come back. Cash only.< /Text>< pics>

If you get Hawaiian shave ice cravings like I do.. then Banana Crepe is the spot you need to go to.

Their shave ice looks and tastes like you're on a Hawaiian island.  The shave ice can be topped with a snow cap (sweetened condensed milk) and you can also add a scoop of ice cream underneath the ice. Yummmmmmmmm. A number of syrup flavors aren't overwhelming, there are plenty of choices, but not too many, and they've got the classics that you want. I had passion and guava syrup and it felt like summertime again even though it was freezing outside.  There are a few tables inside the shop to sit, and they had their heater on full blast so it felt great to just sit and enjoy my shave ice inside.

I'm excited to come back and get another, and also I need to try a crepe. There were a few orders that came up while I was there and they looked so delicious.< /Review>

Cash only establishment that serves shave ice treats on the right and crepes on the left.  Ordering is done this way to allow better flow of traffic.  Most of orders come through for shave ice especially during the Obon Festival.  Crepes are yummy and shave ice refreshing especially on a hot day.  Try the tiger blood during your visit.</Text>

// , Such great service!

If you're visiting during summer, be prepared to wait a few minutes, because this place is really popular. I'm surprised that they don't raise their prices to compensate!</review>

Chaotic decor, low key vibe plus delicious crepes. Looking forward to this becoming a regular spot. Cash only & limited seating. It's not fancy, but the food is wonderful & the people are great.< /text>

The crepe was okay.  The whipped cream didn't taste as good as the crepe place in San Francisco Japantown so that was a bummer.

They have savory and sweet crepes to choose from.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Had the cookies and cream dream crepe. It was good. Big and very filling. Our company enjoyed their crepe also as well as chocolate covered banana. Not sure if they offered water with sweets that rich, I know they had coffee, but in a place like this I'd love to see an accessible water canister like Alhambra. But that would just be the cherry on top. The best part was that even as they closed we did not feel rushed. And that when 10 minutes after leaving (at least 20 minutes past closing) when we realized our son forgot his toy inside, they opened the door for us so that we could look around. That's the kind of service that will keep me coming back and sending them customers. So, check 'em out.<//text>

Really great crepes with the perfect amount of cream, ice cream, and bananas. Has a few outdoor seating but both indoor and outdoor is kind of small. But overall, great place to score some dessert while in Japantown.<//review>

Sweet and savory crepes, shaved ice and ice cream, are great options for any establishment to have.  Unfortunately the savory crepe that we ordered was served crispy which seemed a bit odd.  The crispy may not be so bad had it been one of the crepes which are served with ice cream... maybe next time.< /review>

<text>Dessert crepe with fruit and ice cream was good but expensive.

Hawaiian lunch crepe wasn't very good. Mostly lettuce, little ham, weird tasting cheese, way too much mayo. Also expensive considering it's basically a sandwich.

Their crepes are usually overcooked; ask for them undercooked if you want them soft.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>Well made crepes, I suggest the chocolate nutella with banana. Haven't had the shaved ice in a while, but I remember it being pretty good and there are quite a few flavors to choose from. It's still just cash only so make sure you're aware of that before stopping in.<//review>< Pics>

It's hit or miss with this place. I've come and had excellent shaved ice but this time the old man at the counter literally over charged me and even though we added it up, he wouldn't admit he was wrong or adjust the price. I also ordered my shaved ice with condensed milk and they didn't put any on. Very disappointed this time.<//Review>

Great cash only desert place! They serve coffee, crepes, smoothies and Hawaiian shaved ice! It is usually crowded in weekends. I have had the desert / banana- Nutella crepe and watermelon and tiger blood flavors in shaved ice and loved both of them. 5 for service and it's like stuffed monkeys hanging all around ambience. If you are in Japantown it's worth to stop by for a desert kind ah place!

They also have a frequent buyer card if you are a regular!<//Text>

I had not expected crépes in San Jose's Japantown. The fruit & mixed smoothies were also very good.  Not 5-stars because one has to go next door to wash up.</text>< Pictures>

"The works" crepe was very good.  U fortunately the crepe was not crispy but the contents inside was good.  But then how can you go wrong with Nutella, bananas, ice cream and whipped cream? The strawberries weren't that sweet though.

The Hawaiian shaved ice was huge and very smooth for shaved ice.  The Lychee and Tiger's blood syrups were very sweet and tasty.  The mango syrup was too subtle.  I think a regular size is enough for two ppl to share provided you don't mind sharing.  If I'm going solo, the kid size is big enough.

This place gets really busy but the wait to order goes fairly fast. The wait to get your order is a different story; it was quite a long wait to get 1 crepe and 2 shaved ice.  If I'm visiting Japan town on  hot day and have time, I'd definitely come back.  But I wouldn't go to Japan town just for this.<//text>

I enjoyed it here. I liked their food and shared some with a friend. Haha. It's a pretty nice place. I ordered a Hawaiian crepe wrap for lunch and a Jasmine green milk tea w/ boba which was YUM! My friend ordered the Tuna crepe wrap and also ordered the Jasmine green milk tea after sipping my drink. Urgh. Nonetheless it was a nice place, and I will come again.</Text>

I tried not to order a crêpe today, but it smelled so good when I walked in, I just had to.

The service is still just as good and everyone is just as nice.
There was a incident where my son dropped and spilled his honeydew smoothie that was JUST handed to him. They guy was really nice and made a new one without hesitation. They told me not to worry about cleaning up the mess after I tried to wipe it up.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>It's quality is as cheesy as its price. I ordered shaved ice with mango & Melona. There was no taste of those fruits but fluorescent color.
What's more, this place was dirty, dusty, and cluttered.
Above all,  there were tons of Yelp signs, which made me feel terrible as the company is immoral.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Crepes are ok, but service is is not the greatest. Very long wait when it gets a little busy. The guy (owner) was kind os losses off at my kids all the time.<//review>< Name>

<text>Food was really good but they only take cash which is a bit of a drawback. I had a wrap and a smoothie with pearls.< /text>< Date>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>Had a trailer issue travelling across country with the family and needed some parts to get back on the road. Steven was quick, professional, knew what he was talking about, got us the parts we needed and a great deal on a spare wheel that kept us from having to spend several hours hitting all the tire places in Stockton trying to find one (already been to several.) He was wonderful to deal with and you could tell the people he helps means more to him than the money they bring to him. Stand up, family oriented and honest business.<//Text>< rating>

<Review>Horrible customer service. Asked about a service and the douche bag answered with a smart remark. First time calling to maybe do my business there. But never again. Just 1 phone call it took. Do not recommend & not even close to being professional as the way he answered my question. Customer service is key. I’d recommend training employees on how to speak with Potentiol customers.</Review>< Pics>

As always excellent service and knowledgeable staff. Bob as always is the one who can get you what you need. The guy that just had a new addition to his family also will give you great customer service any day. If you need anything, just ask anyone there. They will get you back in your RV and on the road.< /Text>

We had an problem with our Toy Hauler on the way North & Mike came out to look at it. He had us pull into the yard and fixed it right on the spot and more. Awesome service, one of the best experiences.  Family ran and very hospitable on top. Can’t say enough good.< /text>

<Text>We were driving on I-5 when we lost power to the lights and back camera.  My husband wasn’t sure what to do so I found this business on Google maps.  The person we talked to said come on in and I’ll look at it.  As we were driving the power was restored, but we went in anyway.  My husband went in and talked to??? who gave him ideas on what to do if it happened again.  Thanks so much for kind helpfulness!</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<review>Can't say enough good things about this place. Need a part for prop for our Winnebago door. The part that attached to the RV broke too. The guy reriveted the part so we didn't need to order a custom part from Winnie. Super fast and he tried to adapt the prop we ordered. Didn't work but got us the right part first thing in am. Very grateful for his help since we would be leaving the next day.</review><userid>108841328953435127433< /userid><Name>Ruth Tremblay< /Name><GmapID>0x80900d48f81ae8b3:0x7a2212b65bf2eb88</GmapID><time>1520561457640<//time></record>

Walked in described leaking toilet water supply and had the part in my had for a price so reasonable i didn't bother to price check online. Im sure I could have gotten it cheeper but it wouldn't have been worth it. Next morning I called to ask about a simple problem with my fridge and they weren't afraid to say "probably just need to clean out the burner." as apposed to saying I need to bring it in. A+ business here.< /Text>< date>

If you have an RV you can go and get your parts there it's reasonable price make an appointment peaceful noises on West Lane and then cross the street you have you can go to for East restaurants it's a good price and you can wait to get your RV service<//review>

I do not write reviews very often, however, I feel this may help others that find themselves in difficult situations as we did recently.
Our 2nd Mortgage was interest only for 10 years with B of A.  Prior to the tenth year expiration, we were in the process of working to get a loan modification with them, as we knew we couldn’t afford the new payment once the ten years was done. During this time, however, our loan was sold to SLS..
We tried to get mortgage relief and applied with them twice however, we were only approved for a Short Sale. We had been paying on our home for 20 years so a Short Sale was not something we could accept.. SLS was the most frustrating company I have ever dealt with. The tell lies to assure you they will work with you to find a solution however, we found out the hard way that all the calls I made to their reps were a waste of time.
They put us in pre-foreclosure status with a pending sale date on our home. This is when panic set in. I went on line and the first website that came up was Anthony’s. I put my name and number in as requested and within 15 minutes he called.
He assured me from the first call that we could and would save our home. He worked with us thru the entire process and made calls to SLS with us. He connected us to an attorney, William Kumar. Together they explained step by step what we needed to do all the way thru to resolution. Having someone on your side to help and reassure you thru such a difficult process is invaluable.
We are no longer in foreclosure status and are current with our loan. Our story has a happy ending thanks to Anthony and William.
If you are reading this, you’ve already taken the first step so reach out and talk to Anthony to see what he can do for you.< /text>

<Review>Jason Murphy was the absolute best. Put in contact with the law firm and was the perfect liaison. He made sure we stayed in contact with each other and all needed documentation was received and given on both sides. I am eternally grateful and satisfied with the service of the Homeowner Protection Alliance!!!< /Review>< gmapID>

<Text>Anthony Fierri and his associate Andrea Villa have become by biggest blessing! They stopped me from making what could have been potentially the biggest mistake of my life and guided me in the right direction. He really knows his stuff and I truly believe he is in this business for all the right reasons...he cares about people...I pray God returns blessings to him 10 folds! Thanks you Anthony ....Claudia in Texas<//Text></record>

<review>I found James online during the most difficult time in my life. When we first spoke just his voice got me convinced that he really wanted to help me. So i decided to just go with him, through out my time with james he was always available and always communicated with me. James always made sure things were being handled in a timely manner on my end. I would recommend this company to anyone who is going through a rough time , because i know first hand that all they want to do is help people in any situation.

Mr. Brent Miller has been an excellent source of information and direction. The Homeowner Protectors Alliance set me with Roosevelt Lawfirm for my case which was successfully resolved confidently. They saved my home for my family, pets, and I. I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling to the point of almost losing their home and should be advertised more commonly.<//text>

Jason Murphy and HPA was very instrumental in helping me save my home. Mr. Murphy was on top of everything and prompt in doing in so. He was very understanding of my situation and assured me that once he refers me to the Roosevelt Law Center we would be on the rode to saving my home. Everything Mr. Murphy said actually happened and my home is saved. Thank you Mr. Murphy<//text>

David Allen was very pleasant to work with.  He contacted me the moment I inquired about this service for saving my home.  I was very leary about finding the right place, and thought I would take a chance.  I am sure glad I did because I can now stay in my home.  Thank you Roosevelt law and David Allen at the Home Owner Protection Alliance Group for your kindness and thoroughness.< /Text>

Update Before my posted video;
I called Anthony from HPA a month ago. Now they are working with my mortgage company for resolving the issue I had. Anthony Fierri has had my back since the beginning and has calmed my panic attacks over this problem. So far I am so pleased about the performance of Anthony and Roosevelt law center in helping me and my family. I recommend them to anyone who are dealing with their home mortgage companies. They are a God send when I felt I would lose everything they are there for me. ❤< /text>

A HUGE THANKS to the Homeowner Protection Alliance (HPA) for taking on our case. We didn't know who to turn to and were afraid of who to trust. We were in a vicious cycle of calling getting voicemails and empty promises and no follow through. If we could change anything about the process to save our home we wish we would started the process with  HPA sooner.

David Allen was HPA case advocate and filtered all our calls. David also took the time to reach out to us on numerous occasions to see if we had any questions or concerns.

This was one of the best life choices we made in saving our home and our piece of mind!

I'd like to take a moment to say Thank you to James Garrard at Homeowner Protection. He was not just a person who took my call and shoved me off to someone else. He went above and beyond to help me in any way I needed. Be it with the HOA or if I was felling down in the dumps that I was going to lose my home. He was a friendly voice and reason on the other line. Keeping my hope alive . he never said maybe we can save you're home but you will save you're home. Thank you James for being there to help me threw this hard times My family and I went though. I could not be happier when you called with the good news. You guys are great. Thank you again from my kids to My wife and I.</Text>

Once Homeowner Protection Alliance and I discuss my options and determine what is the best course to take to resolve the foreclosure. We decided on Roosevelt Law Center.  Together Homeowner Protection Alliance and Roosevelt Law Center resolve my case and I am able to stay in my home.  I truly would like to say thank you again to Jessie Bridges for her knowledge, professional and most of all her dedication.  Thank you Paul Washington</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The facts are like this! They didn't help us at all & Carrington mortgage said they sold our house on the 5th of Dec & come to find out it wasn't sold but Carrington bought it at the sale on Dec 8th. We had no knowledge it was even in foreclosure. But we are still here in our home thanks to our new awesome attorney maxwell groswald for filing our chapter 13 that James Gerrard said we couldn't do or bother trying to help us. Carrington has been holding our money just so they could take our house. Randall be< /review>

I want to personally thank the highly skilled Jason Murphy and the team at Homeowner Protection Alliance. Without his help and guidance, I wouldn't have been able to save my home from foreclosure. Mr. Murphy has spent months with me, spending countless hours working on my case and helping me link up with the law center that was able to save my home. I couldn't have done it without you and I'm externally grateful! Thank you!!</text>

I recently applied online and within 30 minutes I received a call. Anthony and Angi was very friendly and straight forward. He didn't sugar coat anything and told me exactly what I needed to do in order to stay out of foreclosure. I can honestly say that after speaking with Anthony, I feel a whole lot better about the situation and where to go from there.<//text>

Found them on Facebook, sent in an inquiry and within an hour I had a phone call from Mr. Brent Miller. From that moment on I knew me and my husband Rodney were in good hands. They handled all the fact gathering to save our house from foreclosure and to get us with a great law firm which was Roosevelt Law Firm. Between the two of them we were able to avoid foreclosure and get approved for a loan modification all within 2 1/2 months. I can not recommend these companies enough for what they have help us through. If anyone is dealing with any issues with their mortgage company please start with Homeowner Protection Alliance. They are honest and will help you figure out the best way to get results.<//Text>

I am blessed to say that God blessed me with Mr. Jason Murphy when I was googling for assistance with saving my home.  He was the reason why and how I found the greatest law firm ever and the best of the best, Mr. Kumar.  Mr. Murphy, thank you wholeheartedly for your time and patience with the processing of my payments.  May our good Lord continue to bless you in all that you do for helping me.< /review>

Jason Murphy was very understanding and took us through this process. We want to thank Jason Murphy for reassuring us and getting this through the finish line so quickly.  It is so nice to find someone that did what he said he was going to.  This process took about 30 days to complete.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Thanks to the Homeowner Protection Alliance and especially Brent Miller for doing the initial search of the highest rated law firm, Roosevelt that gave us a service that led to a successful modification. During the review process with the law firm, Brent periodically gave us updates on our case by going over and beyond his line of duty.

We are so grateful for the work of HPA.

I would definitely  recommend this if anyone ever need help with their home.The first time I spoke to Brent Miller I was in tears as I had no idea what to do or where to go with this whole situation.Through his guidance and working g with Rossevelt Law firm it was a very positive outcome.Both Brent and William were there for me every step of the way.When a message was left to reach back to me when I had questions they were quick with returning calls and always had the answers that I was looking for...no words can describe the gratitude and thanks that I have for both of them!!!</Text>

I was in despair dealing with mortgage modification paperwork. I knew this was beyond me. Like every other piece of information, I made a google search for assistance. The very first link was to the HPA. I called the number and Shawn Porter answered the phone. The rest is history. He was very patient and kind. His voice alone has brought me ease from that day to the very end of the process. I'm so thankful for Shawn Porter and his professionalism.<//Review>

I would like to share that my experience with HPA and Anthony Ferrari for helping me save my home and doing an excellent job keeping me updated on the process. I would not have been able to stay in my home if it had not been for them! Anthony has kept me up to date with everything and took all my information and figured out that Roosevelt Law Center would be the best to help me and he was right! Without Anthony and everyone involved, I don't know how I would have saved my home! I would give the HIGHEST rating possible to anyone who asks.< /review>

I would like to share that my experience with HPA and Anthony Ferrari for helping me save my home and doing an excellent job keeping me updated on the process. I would not have been able to stay in my home if it had not been for them! Anthony has kept me up to date with everything and took all my information and figured out that Roosevelt Law Center would be the best to help me and he was right! Without Anthony and everyone involved, I don't know how I would have saved my home! I would give the HIGHEST rating possible to anyone who asks.< /Review>

Thank you to Homeowner Protection Alliance and Kory Griffin for protecting my home and family. They got me on the phone with the foreclosure attorney and my lender also he helped me with gathering all the important information. PA referred me to a good law firm that was able to protect my home.  During the process all the staff at Homeowner Protection Alliance checked on me and made sure I was alright. Thank you Homeowner Protection Alliance.< /Review>

I would like to thank Homeowner Protection Alliance, specifically Anthony Fierri for connecting me with Mr. William Kumar at Rosselvelt Law Firm. They stood by my side over the past 13 months and helped me save my home. I would highly recommend this service to anyone experiencing difficulties with their mortage company. Thank you!</review>

I would like to thank Homeowner Protection Alliance, specifically Anthony Fierri for connecting me with Mr. William Kumar at Rosselvelt Law Firm. They stood by my side over the past 13 months and helped me save my home. I would highly recommend this service to anyone experiencing difficulties with their mortage company. Thank you!</Text>

I am forever thankful to Homeowner Protection Alliance and all the wonderful people that make this organization the lifesavers they are. They were there for me when noone, i repeat NOONE was there for me. Helped  me understand all my rights and options, referred me to an honorable law firm, and kept me in the know and positive during the whole process. My home is safe, i am in a better place in life, and all is well. Thank you. God bless you. I would recommend Homeowner Protection Alliance without a single second of doubt. If you need help with your mortgage, THEY WILL HELP YOU< /Review>

We here at Homeowner Protection Alliance are extremely proud to have helped and protected your family.'}</Response><Text>To receive court papers that your house is being foreclosed is a terrible experience for anybody that has gone through the ordeal.  It could be overwhelming.  We were six months behind in our payment due to several reasons beyond our control.  When we received thes court papers, my wife and I were both confused and we saw no lights at the end of the tunnel.  While contemplating on what to do, I was inspired to google  foreclosure assistance programs that might be out there for  assistance .  Several organizations came up.  But the one that actually caught my attention was Homeowners Protection Alliance.  I filled out a simple form and in less than two minutes, I received a call from a gentleman  named Anthony Fierri.  He introduced himself, asked me a few questions, requested my permission to speak with the  lender.  While on the phone , Mr. Fierri introduced himself, asked a few questions, asked  the bank official if there was a sale date.  The answer was  no.  Mr. Fieriri then told  the bank official to suspend all actions.  The bank, by law is required to do so.  for ten days.  This would enable Homeowners Protection Alliance time to examine the case and then map out a strategy.  Mr. Fierri then sent me an email detailing documents he would need.  We promptly furnished him all that was requested.

At first, we were somewhat sceptical.  Mr. Fierri  came across as sincere, genuine and caring.  He is dedicated , committed  and knowledgeable.  He was very transparent.  He kept us aware of every step he took along the way.  By the second week, Mr. William Kumar of the  Roosevelt Law Center came on to the scene..  He was assigned our file.  It will be quite accurate to describe him as equally encyclopedic when it comes to foreclosures.  These two gentlemen have very  good sense of humor.  .  They eased the pains by interjecting their updates with laughable jokes which was like therapy.

Angie is another staff member who is a good listener and who can easily fill the vacuum in case Mr. Fierri is not around.  Rarely can anyone call and don't have anyone to talk to.  The Roosevelt Law Center in partnership with Homeowners Protection Alliance are a perfect couple.  They helped us to weather the storm.  What could have been a sever thunder storm ended up being a light shower.  It was by and large a shower of blessing.

Homeowner Protection Alliance helped me when no one else would. When I was in foreclosure, I called HPA and they answered my questions, called me mortgage company with me on the line, asked them all the hard questions and really fought for my rights and protection. They protected me and my home, just like their name HOMEOWNER PROTECTION ALLIANCE. They gathered all the info and referred me to an excellent law firm that gave me a great price and protected my home and modified my mortgage. Now I can make the payments affordable and can stay in my home. Thank you Homeowner Protection Alliance. I would recommend anyone and everyone to HPA. Thank you< /Review>

Thank you to Homeowner Protection Alliance and HPA. Thank you for protecting my home and family. I contacted Homeowner Protection Alliance with a sales date on my home. They got me on the phone with the foreclosure attorney who worked with the mortgage company. After gathering all the important information they helped me organize and gather all my paperwork. HPA referred me to a good law firm that was able to protect me. During the process all the staff at Homeowner Protection Alliance checked in on me and made sure I was alright. Thank you Homeowner Protection Alliance.

<Review>First Of All I Dont Remember  How Or Where I Got The Phone Number For  Homeowner Protection Alliance, All I remember Was the evening That Anthony Fierri Called Us and Said He Could Help Us. Anthony was there every step of the way, even we I was ready to give up he didnt let us. He promised he knew what he was doing and boy what he right. He would even call us just to see how we were doing and to let us know everything was gonna be ok. Everytime I called him and I asked him what he was doing his famous words Were " I am Trying To Save America". Thank you For all that you have done for us and our family.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dcdeb74e8886c3:0x7d31b4a22111c6eb<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

A HUGE Thank you to Jason Murphy for being there in my time of need, I didn't know where to turn when I was having problems with my mortgage company. I did alot of research and came across HPA, after doing my investigation on the company I decided to contact them. This was the best decision I could've made from the start Jason was so nice and understanding through everything, he answered all my questions no matter how stupid I thought they might be. If you're looking for help and your in fear of losing your home, dont hesitate to call them, im so glad I did.</text>

<review>When I received the very first phone call FROM Anthony Fierre it was a very positive phone cal. Every time Anthony has called it was always pisitive. HE pUT me in touch withe William Kumar athe the Roosevet Law Firm and since day one I have been greatly satisfied with both companies. I am was quite comfortable with both offices and was put to mind that nothing was a scam from the beginning. It is a positive feeling knowing that there are actually people that want to do the right stuff and help the ones that are asking for help. THANK YOU AGAIN!!<//review>< pics>

I would like to thank the advocates Anthony Fierri at Homeowner Protection Alliance. , I would have fallen victim to the mortgage company who ignored all my calls for help, and was taking advantage of me. Anthony Fierri had took time to go over my all  options and reviewed my case. The process was quite lengthy, but Anthony made it possible for me. Thank you Homeowner Protection Alliance and Anthony Fierri.</text>

<Text>My husband and I ended up in foreclosure and a sale date on our house. We went through various places to get help. Finally we found a Home Protection Alliance and talked to an Anthony Fierri  , who really understood our case and urgency of our case. They got me on the phone with the foreclosure attorney and my lender. After gathering all the important information they helped me organize and gather all my paperwork.  He was always available for my phone call.
HPA referred me to a good law firm that was able to protect me, during the entire process he was consistently in touch with us. Thanks you Anthony Fierri   and Home Protection Alliance for saving our home.

<text>Anthony Fierri and his staff at HPA are a god-send.  He was with us through all our doubts that our home could be saved. He relentlessly called our mortgage company pushing them to talk to us and getting us set up with Roosevelt Law Center. Even after the lawyers took over Mr.Fierri called to make sure things were going well.</text><gmap_id>0x80dcdeb74e8886c3:0x7d31b4a22111c6eb</gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate><Time>1495819895317<//Time>< UserId.>

<text>I was very disappointed in the staff who abruptly cancelled our service today. I had always respectful to your staff; Wes is our favorite stylist.

Just remember, every issue has 3 sides - hers, mine and the fact.  The staff who cancelled our service today should be encouraged to receive some training in customer service.

I realize it's not easy to hire good employees today, some employers tell me it's hard to hire good people.  I understand it.  Quality should not suffer!

Awesome team @ Citydog! Club Mountain View. We were a little nervous about taking our pup to her first day of daycare, but everyone @ Citydog! was so kind & friendly that helped ease our concerns. The ability to watch via live webcam & the report card at the end of the day are great features! The most important thing is that out pup really enjoyed herself and seems to be looking forward to going back.< /text>

We tried the grooming and boarding services at Citydog for our dog (Miles) and both times he came back happy and clean.
The grooming services are exceptional, Miles is still smelling great even after 5 days of the service and a couple dog park visits.
Miles also greatly enjoyed his stay at the Play Park with other dogs. We kept him there for over 20 hours and it was great to be able to watch him play through the cameras. Even though he needed to be corrected for his behavior the next morning, the staff only had great things to say about him and were happy to take care of him.
I love how they give a report card at the end with photos describing how your dog did during the service. They are professional and reliable, and I am glad we found this place. Miles loves them.< /review>

CityDog was such a refreshing experience. Everyone was so friendly and so sweet to my dog Honey. I really felt comfortable leaving Honey to board with them. That is saying a lot. Will definitely use them in the future. They offer a wide range of services and are flexible with availability. They took Honey the week of for MDW, so that helped us so much!< /text>

<Text>Perry at the reception was so rude. When I called yesterday at 11:38 am to inquire about their dog daycare and whether I need to make a reservation, the receptionist just told me to bring the dog over without telling me anything else. When I brought the dog over the morning of my graduation day, Perry told me without any courtesy that I needed to have the meet and greet session and the vaccine records. I was complete caught off guard and had to drive my dog home last minute and risk not getting to my graduation in time because there were no other option so last minute. When I asked Perry who the manager is, she told me there is NO manager here to keep her or whoever told me the false information over the phone accountable. Perry exemplified what it is to be rude and unapologetic for the company as a whole. Don’t get your dog there if you really NEED responsible dog care.<//Text>< pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I recently visited Citydog to go through their meet & greet and tour of the facility. My new pup hasn’t been around a lot of different dogs so I’ve wanted to check out this place for their daycare. I was blown away by the professionalism and personal tour of their building. The place is really clean, and I love the transparency of the building set up. You can see from the sidewalk the dogs playing and the employees watching over them. My husband and I decided to purchase a package based on the employee that took us around the tour. Rachel, who gave us the tour, was super polite, friendly, and reassured us our pup would be well taken care of and made us feel very comfortable; important for us since we are first time dog owners. I’m looking forward to taking my pup here for more visits and possibly boarding!</Text>< Pics>

Went in for a tour during their Grand Opening. I'm excited to have a new dog place in Mountain View and this place is clean, the staff are very friendly and my dogs had a great first day there! Their little online report cards were very cute, detailed, and complete with pictures. It is just a little more price-wise than the place we've been taking them, but the convenience of the location and the fact that they can stay and play until 9pm is worth it. We'll be visiting again soon for sure!<//text>

I pass by Citydog! Club all the time just to see the cute happy pups playing inside, and just recently had the pleasure of taking my dog Lucky to have his first grooming appointment here! The online booking system was seamless and easy to use, and I actually greatly appreciate that the team took the time to check our pet vaccination record even if we were just coming in for a groom and not daycare/boarding. Lucky is a shy but sweet rescue boy who is usually scared around other dogs, and Westley took care of him with the utmost gentleness and kindness. I got both a courtesy text and call to notify me when Lucky was ready. I believe when the grooming is done but you haven't arrived yet, they offer the option of letting your pup hang out in the play area to make friends, but since Lucky is still working on his socialization skills, I marked on the online appointment form that I would like to respectfully decline this offer. When I arrived to pick Lucky up, he was brought to the front from a private separate area. This is another A+ for Citydog! Club because they (1) are kind enough to offer to let your pup have a short playdate while you're on your way to pick them up and (2) respected and paid attention to my request to let him rest on his own for today. As for the haircut, my Lucky looked so very handsome and happy! I truly feel that Westley and the team went above and beyond, and I would recommend Citydog! Club to anyone seeking top quality pet grooming with top shelf customer service. Lucky and I look forward to coming back real soon! :)< /Text>

The folks at CityDog were really great with my shy dog. They suggested the quietest time for her meet and greet appointment, and let me know they offer isolated breaks when dogs get overwhelmed. Highly recommended!</text>

We took our dog for grooming and meet+greet session. The staff is very responsible sending out reminders about the appointment and making sure all the required information is in. The place felt good and was very clean and sectioned very well for different dogs to avoid stress esp. for new pups. The grooming was done on time and nicely, with a happy dog afterwards. The best part about the day care is we can see our dogies live during day time as they play . Also, i enjoyed pictures of pet during grooming that they shared with comments in the report sent out later. We highly recommend this place though it is little bit expensive.<//Text></record>

<Review>This place is awesome. Our fuzzy little boy has really enjoyed his time here so far. The team seems very attentive and loving with the doggos as well. We also had a good experience with grooming and nail trimming here, he came back smelling like blueberries for about a week, it was wonderful!
Being that my significant other and I are both nurses I wish they would open earlier since 7am is too late to drop him off, but other than that I think this place is great!< /Review></record>

<review>Citydog Club in Mountain View did a superb job taking care of Lexi this weekend!  The staff were so friendly and professional.  We felt safe dropping her off, knowing they were following COVID protocols carefully.  Lexi later returned to us fluffy, groomed, and oh, so, happy.  FIVE STARS!  I highly recommend this place!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>Our dog loves this place!  He always has a blast and we know that he will be supervised and well taken care of.  I'm always impressed that they greet him by name when we arrive, even though he only stays there on the occasional long weekend.  Highly recommend!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

We are impressed with the cleanliness of their facility, their attention to detail and how much they love the dogs.  We appreciate the transparency of the facility - where you can walk by the large windows to see the dogs (which also entertains the dogs too!) and the doggie cams that you can watch from home. It's a relief to know that our little puppy will be taken well care of while we travel. We couldn't be more confident in this place.</Review><time>1602085898402< /time></record>

We shopped around and went to several different daycares before we found Citydog. The staff are undeniably the most friendly staff and truly care about the dogs. It is super clean and the dogs are separated by size and energy level. Citydog is transparent in the way they allow you to watch your pup on video throughout the day and the front of the building is clear windows. My pup Oliver has the best time here in the play park and I would recommend anyone to this place :)</Review>

Don't hesitate to visit Citydog if you are thinking about doggy daycare or overnight services.  Citydog is very clean and they also offer spa services for your pet at reasonable prices.  They do everything from trimming nails to facials for your dog.  That's right facials.  Hamilton will be going quite often.</review>

I love this place for my dog! I found this spot on Yelp and read great reviews but my experience there was even better! I scheduled a meet and greet and the staff was so patient and kind with my nervous dog. He seemed very comfortable when they took him to the huge play area! The whole area seemed very clean and my dog seemed so happy!<//Text>

My husband and I absolutely love CityDog MV! Our goldendoodle Sherlock has the best time with the other pups and the human handlers. The team is so nice and friendly, they take such great care of Sherlock and he loves them so much, he's always running to go inside when we pull up. Thank you so much to the team and we highly recommend.< /text>

Our mini poodle absolutely loves coming here! He has the best time with the employees and the other dogs. They even send you pictures and a cute report card on how their day went. Along with this, you are able to watch your dog on cameras they’ve installed in the play areas. Our puppy also got groomed here and looks great!!<//Text>

City Dog came to be our last resort, and expecting the same mistreatment like previous centers we’d visited, we decided to prepare to groom our Chihuahua entirely at home. After our visit with City Dog, however, we won’t visit anywhere else. City Dog has incredible staff that greet both you and your dog enthusiastically at the door, and care for your dog throughout. After leaving our dog at City Dog for a wash and brush package, we returned around an hour later to find our dog had been washed, but his nails had not been cut and his glands had not been expressed. When we asked the City Dog staff why, they told us he’d been very defensive, and scared of being in a new environment. We asked the City Dog staff why they didn’t put a muzzle on our dog (as both our vet and other grooming centers had done), and they were completely against the idea; stating that they didn’t want to intimidate our dog, but make him comfortable and want to return again. We were taken aback - no center has provided us with the concern and care like City Dog. Their services are definitely value for money. We will definitely be sticking with City Dog - there’s no doubt about it. For anyone searching for safe, friendly, and valuable services, City Dog is for you.<//Review><user_name>Amaya Malik< /user_name><Response>{'time': 1575499508837, 'text': 'Thank You!'}</Response><Pics>None</Pics>< Rating>

<Review>Our dog is always happy when we get to CityDog and he looks fantastic when we pick him up from the groomer. He's stayed overnight once for 4 nights and while he was happy to see us when we picked him up, he didn't seem like he was in a hurry to leave - like he has been when leaving other places. The staff members are very friendly and the facilities are clean. I like that you get a report card with pictures at the end of the dogs stay and my only change would be to get these report cards on a daily basis when boarding.</Review>< Pics>

After 5 years with a mobile groomer, I tried Citydog! Club groomer last week. My dog is a little timid so I was a nervous. They were really gentle with her, and she looked great when she was done! I only wish they had more available hours with such an excellent groomer!<//text>

Clean and transparent facility with friendly staff! They gave a very thorough tour of the kennel, play areas, and grooming stations so that I know exactly the environment my pup would be in. Everything was sparkling clean. Drop off in the mornings is easy too. Plenty of curbside parking right in front of the facility.< /Text>

We were driving down El Camino, saw Citydog Club, Googled it, read about it, and made an appointment to stop by (the same day) - all within 15 minutes!

Elena was super helpful and nice over the phone. When we got there, Lauren showed us around and gave our dog, Geronimo, some play time to see how he would do with the other dogs.

I love their cleanliness (it doesn't smell like dog whatsoever), they have 4 different play areas, and enough staff to take care of all the dogs. They will even provide a report card for your pup - just make sure to ask at the time of drop off!

This is the first time we've brought our dog to daycare and I felt comfortable and relieved knowing our dog was in good hands. You can even watch them play with their webcam link.</review>

<Text>This Review is ONLY about DAYCARE SERVICES

My current puppy is my first ever pet so you can imagine (like a first kid), I overthink everything and only want the best for him/spoil him. My puppy has gone to various day cares since he was 10 weeks old an d now he's 13 months. I look for variety in facilities he is approved to go to (outdoor, indoor, pool time, types of dogs, you name it) CityDog! is by far the cleanest facility he has ever gone to and he has a great time. The staff and evaluators do a good job keeping the dogs with like attitudes and also allow the dogs to switch between play areas as appropriate. I also love that the play areas face the public street so that people walking by can peek in. Even throughout COVID, they have been ensuring they take all cautionary measures to limit any and all contact between humans. The staff wear gloves and masks when handling the dogs. They have also been allowing everyone to pre-purchase daycare packs at the new member rate to assist people in these uncertain times. For those who work long hours, they are open 7:00 am - 9:00 pm and work with your puppy/dog on taking naps to keep them at top shape and you can schedule mealtime during their day for a nominal fee.

Overall, this place couldn't have been a better find for us. I have also heard from a close neighbor that they have great grooming services as well at a competitive and reasonable price point.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>My dog used to go to another daycare and HE is making the choice to stay at CityDog Club. Not only is the facility immaculate- that says a lot about the employees who are doing so much to MAINTAIN their beautiful hotel. * I’ve also worked at many dog boarding/daycares so impressing me is not easy.

Thank you again for helping me find a hotel that IS ABLE to cater to my dog because they don’t offer more than they can successfully do.
Also - report cards were the cutest-PERSONAL and  SPECIFICALLY about my dog :o

<review>This is a great place to leave your Dog Babies. I use this a lot and the people are very knowledgeable and kind. No more worrying if your pet is ok or not.

The Citydog team took such good care of him, sent lots of pics, and were super responsive to all of my questions and outreach. I've had a couple of very bad Rover experiences so finding this gem was truly a life saver and will 10/10 be returning!

I should add: I called over a dozen boarding facilities before I found Citydog! and was highly concerned to discover that the vast majority crate dogs ~6pm to ~8am and circulate them in and out of their crates throughout the day  for ~2-4 hours of daily playtime. I couldn't have left my dog in a situation like that in good faith, and was AMAZED that City dog lets the dogs play / roam free ALL day (something like 8a-9p) and if you don't pay additional for a nightly private suite (which I didn't) they get to stay in the run with the other dogs through the night. The unlimited play and nightly companionship was PRICELESS to me, but fortunately,  affordable here!</Text><user_id>113329132528979264839< /user_id>< resp>

<text>LOVE this company. I've taken my chow chow to Doozydog in Washington, DC for the past 3 years and have always been very happy with the affordability and quality customer service. My family moved to the Bay Area last week and I was thrilled to see there's now a Silicon Valley location! My dog was transported across the country and was FILTHY and somewhat traumatized from the cross country drive. The team at Citydog took such great care of her - not just cleaning her up, but helping her to feel at ease after such an arduous trip. Can't recommend them enough!!!!</text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1575499519138, 'text': 'Thank You!'}</resp><gmapID>0x808fb1dbed742b25:0x4f1e8fe313c2c7a6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>NOPE! I checked it out because the prices seemed good but I will never bring my dog there. One dog section was left completely unattended and the other section the staff was screaming at the dogs to stop barking. Actually screaming. That's super not ok and she was clearly upsetting the dogs. They got as far away from her as they could, tail tucked, and obviously scared. The manager said and did nothing. The space was so small the dogs could barely move around. They offer dog walks which are extra so it ends up being really expensive if you actually want your dog move around while under their supervision.<//Review><time>1564711751277<//time>< rating>

Pricey but the dogs are very well cared for and messes are cleaned up quickly. Overnight boarding is available too. Webcam available too, so you can see how your pup's day is going.< /text>

I love that it only takes about an hour for each grooming session and the dogs are hand dried, instead of being put into a kennel for hours while their hair dries. Our little pup is always in such a happy mood when she's done getting her haircut from Citydog! I highly recommend their grooming services!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1568672766892, 'text': 'Thank You!'}</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>***Disclaimer, I never take time to write a review, but this review is necessary***

If you're looking for a doggy daycare/boarding facility, look no further. I'll start this by stating that prior to relocating to the Bay Area, I used to take my dog to Citydog's! other facility in San Diego. After relocating to the bay in January, I struggled to find a daycare/boarding facility to take my fur baby to. I was running into concerns where I felt my dog was either not 100% safe and/or well cared for. Other facilities also lacked cleanliness as well as looked more like a penitentiary.

On Wednesday 7/24, I received an email notification that Citydog! had opened a location in Mountain View. I immediately knew my struggle of searching for the perfect facility was now over. I showed up to Citydog! yesterday and both my dog and I were graciously greeted by the staff and provided a tour from the Regional Manager, Diana. This facility is beyond perfect and will exceed all of your expectations. The dog handlers were very friendly and upbeat. You can easily see that they take their jobs seriously and will provide the utmost care/love for your dog. After my tour, I can say that this facility is essentially the Ritz Carlton for dogs. Now I can take a much needed vacation knowing that my dog is in the best hands possible (a side from my own).

Thank you Citydog! Club- your core value of MTFL (make them feel loved) will be a staple in the Bay Area!

***UPDATE: recently read a review from a disgruntled customer and I can confidently say that no dogs are left unattended in the play park. There is a divider in between the large and small dog park. The handlers are taller than the gate and can easily view both sides from either park. The divider has a section that opens, so the handler has immediate access to either side. I would NEVER leave my dog at a facility that lacks safety. You can watch your dog on the webcam to prove it. Also, after being a highly satisfied customer of Citydog’s sister location in San Diego for over 2 years, it’s disappointing to read a meritless review. I love this new location and the amazing staff. We will be forever customers as long as we live here.</text>< pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Deceptive vehicle description. Highly risky purchasing from this auction. With COVID you are not allowed previews. You MUST trust their description of the vehicles. They will not disclose anything knowing fully cars they put out have engine , transmission, structural issues. Cars with excessive body damage or rust , they take pictures at angles which hide any damage.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>My BF took his car there and it was sold with no issues. The main issue was getting the check from them.  I had to make multiple calls and they were very rude. They lack good customer service. The check is apparently lost and it has been over a month and they are so slow in issuing a new check.<//Text>< Rate>

Had me come all the way there to get my belongings just to find out my belongings that were in my vehicle weren't even there. Tried to prepare my car for auction early without the proper requirements, and when asked for my belongings were, noted down that they were disposed of the same day. Apparently there's only one guy that disposes belongings that he's so happened to clock out 5 minutes before I got there so there was nothing they could do. Wasted my time, just to find out that my belongings were at another third-party location< /Text>

Pretty decent deals and some cool stuff you can occasionally find at the shops inside.. Honestly not the absolute best of indoor swap meets/bargain store spots that I've been to before but it's like def not one of the worst ones either< /Review>

The reason why I gave them three stars is because well let me start off by saying they have everything I need all Dickies shoes work clothing sweaters and jackets in the apparel section very good selection the reason why I gave them three stars is the men's Dickies shorts and pants went up in price to almost $30 and $26 is way too much money for a pair of Dickies shorts back in the day it used to be $19...<//text>

like everyone else says, generally overpriced, but the t shirt place in the front is ok, and the phone/record store is good. they have alot of boost mobile phones with great customer service, and they can hook you up w/ a plan with all of the other phones they carry. the cd's r overpriced freebies( cd's that are given out by the record label for promotional use), but if u ask, u  can get mixtapes there. i got some really good ones. i was surprised at the collection. you have to ask though. if u r a musician, they will help promote your cd's and get you good shows if u have talent. ask for poppy.
warning, dont buy jerseys from there at the jersey store. they are cheap knock offs and they will charge you the same price as a real embroidered jersey. makes me miss crenshaw and slauson.< /Text>

As you stroll through, you can see the great nature of dress. They are likewise selling wonderful watches and sacks for young ladies. I wanted to shop here on the grounds that I have numerous options of styles. Every one of the things are at an entirely sensible expense. Should visit the spot!< /text>

You can find almost anything you want and you wouldn't be bored the whole day. The place is huge and you should watch out if you're bringing children. I bought my beautiful bag here and my trendy dress. They are really nice. It is worth the money! This place is highly recommended!<//Review>

It is nice to do some shopping here at Redeo Galleria. They have a lot of options that you can choose from. Good selections of restaurants and wonderful scenery. The place is huge and spacious so you will be able to follow COVID guidelines. Prices are really good as well.<//Review>

Everything you need can be found inside this mall. From shopping to dining, clothes to accessories, from local to international brands. Of course, if you're on the hunt for a taste of some good time along with your shopping bags, this is the place to experience it as this place is a shopper's paradise. Highly recommended!< /review>

<review>This would be the best place to shop because of its amazing high-quality products and a variety of available brands. This shopping mall really has it all, restaurants, toy stores, etc. My family really had a great time here, and I'm sure that we will come back here again someday. Thank you so much!

Great fresh seafood and amazing views of so many things like the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and the Bay Bridge, as well as the Sea Lions and the marina. This is a major tourist attraction, but another one of those places you have to go if you are going to visit San Francisco. If you are on a budget, maybe eat somewhere else.<//text>< pictures>

They were all sun bathing and it was actually really entertaining to see them fighting for a spot and some of them chilling with no drama. It also smells pretty fishy in this area which you will get a huge whiff of because of the wind blowing in your face.<//review><rating>4< /rating></record>

Pier 39 is a great an excellent place to visit when touring around San Francisco. On the pier you will find plenty of restaurants of all kinds and price ranges. Lots of souvenir shops with the $10 t-shirts and pretty much anything you can think of with a SF logo on it.< /Text>

What a combo! Learning new NLP techniques at tourist haven Pier 39. Can you spot air swimmer Succophin, the Dolphin made of succulent & flowers in front of the "Only in San Francisco" store. Catch him before he grows into a bush. :)</Review>

If you are from out of town or new to the area, you have to come check out the Pier. Lot's of restaurants and shops to visit here. Great views of the bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate Bridge, and sea lions. Although once you have been here a couple time the novelty definitely wears off and it becomes a place you avoid at all cost till you have out of town guest.<//review>

<review>Enjoyed the vibes here, definitely is the parallel to Pike place market in Seattle! There's more bustling people and even street musicians that fit the mood well so I enjoyed that.  Food at every corner! Eat away</review>< Pics>

<Review>Everything you need under one pretty parking lot location! Home Goods, Whole Foods, Dry Bar and Yogaworks is around the block. They have a few restaurants, there is also a Best Buy and World Market. Across the street is a whole area for clothes shopping, nothing high end but sufficient ( and a Pink Berry) I love going here!<//Review>< name>

<Name>Arnold Russell</Name><Review>This place is a must do for any tourist visiting San Francisco. Expect the crowds to move slow and it is usually packed. Park across the street at the Pier 39 Parking lot. Check in on yelp to unlock the free fun pack which includes a booklet of coupons to multiple Locations at the pier.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1597347041589</time>< gmap_id>

<Review>You'll find everything here, California wine tasting room by the water, a bar with local craft beer selection, California fruit mini market, restaurants and lots of name brand shops. It's a great place to go for people watching and relaxing, also we saw so many sea lions hanging out it was the best!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Very touristy, but lots to do! There are so many restaurants to pick from, both chain and local. Stop by to get something to eat, have a dessert or just do some people watching and souvenir shopping! During the day there are plenty of street performers out and about...hear some music, watch people make art, etc. If you're looking to kill an hour or more, Pier 39 is worth a stop!!< /text>

What a combo! Learning new NLP techniques at tourist haven Pier 39. Can you spot air swimmer Succophin, the Dolphin made of succulent & flowers in front of the "Only in San Francisco" store. Catch him before he grows into a bush. :)</Text>

< Review>
Pier 39 is a wonderful tourist location that is crowded with people. We had trouble finding the entrance to the parking. One entrance said it was temporarily full and blocked but when we paid $20 to a private parking and walked over, there was another entrance! I was disappointed because we eventually dined at the dinner there and could have gotten a validation but why blocked one entrance?< /Review>

<review>I love the Rodeo Galleria Shopping Center. This outdoor shopping mall has a little bit of everything, and lots of eye candy as well. After a long day of shopping you can walk over to the outdoor patio style dining area and choose from a wonderful selection of sit down restaurants that all have wonderful menus and cocktails!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Super crowded! That's the ONLY reason I didn't like it enough for 5*.
However, this place was pretty amazing. Tons of tourists eateries and gift shops and sea lion watching. Not sure i'll come visit this crazy crowded place if i'm back in San Francisco... but one never knows.< /Review>

Before we actually made it back to the car we stopped at Rodeo Galleria Shopping Center again and took some pictures of the girls with the Christmas tree. I love coming in December to Frisco they always decorate the Pier nicely late in November just in time for Christmas.< /text>

<Review>WARNING stay away from the electronic store in the mall they are scam artist. They have extremely cheap products on display and a lot of them so if u touch one it breaks and they make you pay for it. I’m sure this is the only way they get a sale.</Review>< user_id>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is uncomfortable because many places are closed, but even during the coronavirus these days, T-Mobile is very kind to people who need help.

(Translated by Google) Thank you for the T-Mobile senior discount fee. He helped me to use the phone well even during the pendemic, so I am using it well.

(Translated by Google) I lost my phone, so I just heard it in a hurry, but thank you for solving it quickly. It's nice to have a T-Mobile where Koreans work. It is nice to have a place to look around the mall and drink tea while waiting. I've never been there for the first time.

핸드폰을 잃어버려서 그냥 급해서 들렸는데 빨리 해결해줘서 고맙습니다. 한국사람이 일하는 티모빌이 있어서 반갑네요. 기다리면서 몰 구경도하고 차도 마실곳이 있어서 좋네요. ㅈ 처음 와봤어요.</review>

(Translated by Google) I often come to my cell phone, but parking at lunchtime is a bit of a problem...parking is convenient, but I have to wait a little for lunch. There is no opening fee, so if you come from Korea, T-Mobile often comes here. It's a good place to see the mall while waiting, and it's a convenient shopping mall in many ways.

(Original)
핸드폰하러 자주 오는데 점심시간 주차는 좀 문제...파킹이 편하긴헌데 점심때는 조금 기다려야 함. 개통비가 없어서 한국서 손님오면 여기 티모빌 자주옵니다. 기다리는동안 몰구경하기도 좋구 여러모로 편리한 쇼핑몰.<//text>

Go to the cost of the chip, which is provided free of charge. Never go to the mobile phone store on the 1st floor. He feels bad because of his friendly owner. " I was really shocked by my unkindness.
Seeing that there is someone who thinks the same thing, "Lee, the owner of the T-Mobile Cell Phone Store" wants Nari to realize how rude he is to customers.
Overall rating: The overall mood of the mall is good, so I gave it 3 stars, but it's my honest feeling that I can't even give a star when I think of the male owner of a T-Mobile phone store.

똑 같은 생각을 하시는 분이 있는 것으로 보아서 " 티모빌 핸드폰매장 남자주인"나리께서는 스스로에게 자신이 얼마나 고객들에게 무례한지를 깨닫았으면 하는 바램입니다.
총평점:몰 전체 분위기는 양호한 편이라 별3개를 주었지만 티모빌 핸드폰매장 남자주인을 생각하면 별 1개도 못줄 것 같은게 제 솔직한 심정이네요.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I've only been here once, but the food was great, and The Flame Broiler did have a good menu (wide variety) to choose from. I'll definitely return if I'm in the area.<//Review>

They were quick. I was able to order on their online app and walked in when it was ready. Everyone wore masks and stayed their distance, 6 feet or more. Food was good.</Text>

The food is always consistently cooked well at this location.  The portions and food quality are good.  They workers at this location have to deal with some class A jerks sometimes and they do a great job at putting up with them.  South Gate can be a challenging place to work at...<//Review>

Don’t get me wrong the food it’s pretty tasty I been eating flame broiler for more than 5 years , the reason I’m giving them poor rating is, first they never answer the phone I was trying to call in advance to pick up my order when I came in in the store the attendant was pretty nice and attentive the worst thing I notice was the person in the kitchen was talking in the phone at the same time was preparing food without washing hands I hope the owner has more attention in this details because of the situation of we’re living that can’t be sorry for posting this but I think we have to be more consistent and take care each other<//Review>

I've been going to this location since it opened. Today I walked in I oreded when it was time to pay the guy cashier told me they cant take my bill. All i had was a hundred dollar bill. I asked him if I can please talk to the manager she aslo declined to take my bill. Stating that they can't take bills over 20. horrible they have no signs of no bills over 20. And she told me that none of the the stores will take my bill. As a manager i will not decline to take any money i would test the bill make sure its real and to avoid any problems i would have a sign up. Horrible customer service. I have about 5 employees that would go to this location for lunch today marks our last day. By the way I walked over to jersey mikes next door and they happily took my bill!!< /Text>

The staff is always very friendly and knowledgeable. I have been coming here for several years and always appreciated the help.

My review is low because I have been in twice recently (Dec. 2020) and saw every single smiling face. Not a single one I couldn't see!

Extremely disappointing, especially in our small community. This review was 5 stars three years ago.</review>

Visited new store for first time, was immediately greeted. Needed a battery for my keyless entry, Johnny was very helpful and even replaced the battery. Johnny asked if we had an account, we did not so he entered our cell# in the system. I commented on how neat and organized the store was, he mentioned the old store was half the size. Johnny was engaging and  made a great impression.  Have always shopped at the nearby competitor, but now feel Napa Auto is a better choice.< /review>

I went in to this store and stood in line waiting my turn behind  a customer that was being helped. There was 2 men working the counter. The counterman helping the customer in front of me helped carry parts outside. The other counterman finished with someone one the phone. Then another customer comes in the store walked down the aisle grabbed what he needs and the counterman asked he he can help him instead of me. Which made me upset because I was in a time crunch. He told me he couldn't keep track of the customers in the store. Which was only 2. How hard is that??  When I was standing there for atleast 5 minutes and he looked at me a couple of times. Customer service was horrible. One reason I dont shop at Napa. Plus they didn't have the part I needed when they said they did.</review>

<text>Two clerks at the desk. One exclusively helping a man, the other answering the phone. Neither clerk greeted me, nor did they even acknowledge my presence. No, "Hi, be right with you." No, "Sorry for the delay." Instead, complete lack of eye contact even though the bell at the door signaled my entry, my two minutes of looking for what I needed on my own, and my five minutes of standing within three feet of the desk right in plain sight. Then, a female employee arrived, and she looked right at me, and still not even a "Hi. Someone will be with you shortly."  Napa Auto Parts in Lakeport, CA -- shame on you. We're a small town, and I will let all my friends and neighbors know how rude and unprofessional you are.< /text>< Pics>

Ordered a part a week ago, it didn't arrive on the specified date and the guy behind the desk told me "oh it happens all the time check back on Monday at 8am. I called them at 10:00 and they told me it would be on a shuttle at 2. I will be speaking with a manager when I do finally get my part.<//Text>

< review>
I always take out loans with oportun, I think it is fast, safe and easy. I don’t normally write reviews but I felt like I had to. The  first time I applied to oportun the lady who was helping me was very rude, I just let her be and towards the end she started acting nice and told me to rate them 5 stars. This is the second time I come to oportun in this location and this time I came with my mom. The same lady (Karen) was helping us. I asked her a question and she corrected me, she didn’t even let me finish explaining, she just interrupted me. We came in 20 mins before closing. We were waiting for our call and right  before 6 we were done and she said she couldn't help us anymore to come back tomorrow. My mom left the store unsatisfied and i left the store upset. I don’t think I will be comfortable taking another loan out from that location. I will not be coming If I need another loan. I had a bad experience twice so I’ll  just look somewhere else.<//review>
