<Text>I love Sally and the guys who replaced my windshield!! They did an amazing job, were super helpful and replaced my windshield with a quickness. Sally made me feel right at home while I waited in the clean and comfortable waiting area. The price was unbeatable and over all the experience with this team was a memorable one to say the least! I will definitely be back to give them my business anytime I need a window replaced! 5 stars isn't even enough... These guys rock!</Text>< Resp>

<Text>Poorly run business. Called in the morning and spoke to a nice lady. Was told a tech could come out in the afternoon and to expect a phone call. 2pm comes around. Nothing. Not even a phone call. I called them and was told by the same lady 3:30pm. 4pm: No phone call. So I called them back. The same lady was insistent that “someone would be there by the end of the day babe.” Wrong. Wasted my entire day waiting. Blocked my work schedule for nothing.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80945e365a283187:0x54fa3327faf8b583<//Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics>< name>

Very much satisfied with their service. The office manager is very nice, honest, and professional. They're pricing was lower than most companies I've called. The guys that installed my windshield were cool dudes and very professional. Definitely recommend this company to my friends and family and any one else who ask me for a recommendation.<//Text>

Having my passenger side window bashed in by a tweaker looking for anything that he cold pawn off, this negative experience brought me to CVAG. Sally, Junior and Mario are super professional individuals that take pride in what they do. They worked me in to their extremely busy schedule and did an exceptional job on my sports car. The glass tint matched my factory glass which was a concern of mine going in. Their prices can't be beat and I will be bringing all future automotive glass work here. Knowing that CVAG is here is a big sigh of relief if this ever happens again.  What started as a negative experience turned into a positive. Thanks!< /Text><Name>Ernie Gee</Name>< date>

It did take a few days to get the windshield replaced but now my husband is extremely happy with the job they did.

So i called these guys because they had such good reviews and they were Mobile, I would not recommend these guys to anyone! First of all they were supposed to be here between 1 and 2 and they had me waiting wo a phone call for 5 hours! (I had to call them 3 times for an update) She assured me they would be there and that I would get a discount for my wait. (BTW the discount was a whole 5 dollars. LOL! that is about 2 and a half percent. Please keep your five dollars!) So Im like ok things happen, I just want my window fixed. well after the instal the window does not seem to close right, it makes a lot of noise and I am afraid to close it all the way in fear of it breaking, Plus I do not know if they lost it or broke it? but the interior door light is totally missing. I tried to call them about my concerns the next day and was told i had the wrong number and hung up on. so disappointed!!</Text>

<Review>My drivers side window fell into my door and didn't roll back up, came here to get it fixed and was informed it was a lifetime warranty. 2 years later same problem happens to same window, so I go back with my receipt and all paperwork that was given to me from the first time and the front desk lady says they won't honor it because she doesn't know what it is? Not sure what she even meant by that, I don't know what else she needed from me but I was turned away without my window fixed. Never going back.<//Review><gmapID>0x80945e365a283187:0x54fa3327faf8b583<//gmapID><username>Michael Rodriguez<//username>< resp>

Best place you can go to! Ask for Sally she’s amazing super friendly and takes care of you! I was already annoyed that my car was broken into and she made sure I was well taken care of something to drink a donut Netflix really let me relax and keep my mind off of what happened while they fixed my window and they don’t take long just a couple minutes I have no issues with the work they did they even cleaned up all the broken glass I would definitely recommend Central Valley Auto Glass to everyone I know! Thank you!<//Text>

<Review>Second time I've been here in 10 years, both times I've walked away satisfied and very happy! Sally is friendly and a blast to talk to while you wait, there's coffee and donuts, a large tv all to make your wait pleasant and Sally makes sure you're aware is all of it. The work is also excellent and guaranteed! Will recommend anyone to come here and will always return with y business when I need it!<//Review>< Pictures>

I would, highly, recommend Central Valley Auto Glass! Sally was great. She gave me a great quote, to have me bring my car in and have my window replaced. When I called back, I explained that I was expecting a home delivery from Target, and that I did not know if I could make it in on that day. When I explained this to her, Sally offered to have her technician, Tadeo, come to me. He was very polite, efficient and methodical, not to mention, he got the job done quickly! In addition, I was charged the same price to have them come out to my home, as I would have if I had gone to them. Would, definitely, use their services in the future!!<//Review>

That personal service that's hard to find these days. You call and a person answers! In the middle of the day someone broke into my car (and smashed my window).  Central Valley Auto Glass got it all fixed up before the end of the day!  I don't wish a vandalized vehicle on anyone, But if you need help these guys are good.<//text>

Amazing service! I called for a quote, after calling around, this company was the best price. Within an hour they were at my door and 45 mins later they were done! The office staff was really helpful and kind, and the installers were nice and did their job quick and seamless. Very happy with the service and price. Definitely recommend!<//Text>

Best place to get you window replacements, new or old they got you cover. Call to get an estimate, Sally the receptionist answered all my questions. She also went out the way to get me a great price, far better than the other shops around. Made an appointment got me out in less than hour. The lobby is pretty nice as well, I enjoy a nice warm coffee while watching a movie on Netflix. Thanks, will come again for any car window replacements.</text>

Had a wonderful experience! By far the best customer service. Araceli was great. She quoted me a price, and had Edgar come out to my work to fix my windshield. He did an amazing job. Very pleased with everything. Will be back if I ever have any other issues. Thank you for everything!</text>

Took our 85' K5 Blazer in for tailgate window repair.  They fixed it with no problem.  Quick and for a great price.   Staff was very friendly, professional and extremely helpful.   Highly recommend them.   Definitely will be returning costumers when we need repairs.  😊  Awesome customer service.< /review>

I was scared there would be leaks or something after the installation but they have a lifetime warranty on the installation itself if there were ever leaks etc.

It has been many months and so far so good,  no leaks etc.

I even asked another shop owner in north fresno who was extremely nice enough to let me know the installation looked to be done properly and assured me I really shouldn't worry about it too much because of the lifetime warranty on the installation.

I highly recommend Central Valley Auto Glass.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Time>1499802995667<//Time><Review>Waiting 2 1/2 hours for someone to get to my house to replace my windshield. Was never called to be told they were going to be late, I called them once when they were first late only to reschedule which is completely fine. I understand if something comes up. But then had to call again to make sure they were still coming after they were late. Then a 3rd time after being late again. (I waited 10 minutes after the aappointment, then 15 minutes, then half an hour late). Was told I would get a discount after this replacement went from 3pm, to 430, to 530. My discount ended up being $10 off. I wouldn't recommended. Rather they had just told me they had to come another day or be honest about my wait time. If they  seem to be behind, be prepared to wait for them as long as it takes.<//Review><Rate>2</Rate>< gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I came here today December 27th to get my windshield replaced because it had a huge crack all across the windshield. Sally was very nice and helpful she is professional and assisted me right away. She really takes care of her customers and I would most definitely come here again she told me they do auto body work, my car had a huge scratch on the side due to a hit and run the car hit mines and scratched the whole right side of my car, but she let me know they can fix that and I will definitely consider it, I’m low on cash right now lol. The price to replace the windshield was reasonable in fact it was pretty low to me and most places charge three hundred. This is an excellent establishment reasonable prices. I highly recommend.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80945e365a283187:0x54fa3327faf8b583</GmapID></record>

Hubby visited the shop to have a broken window on my silver Accord replaced. From the initial call, Sally was really nice, helpful and was very professional. I'm Xtremely  happy with the window/price and professionalism in the installation. It will be hard to believe anyone who has anything bad to say about this place. We will definitely refer family & friends.. by the way, good place to eat next door while u wait(Las Mañanitas).  Thank you Central Valley Auto Glass!<//Text>

<Review>I went in for a job and they broke an exterior piece of the trim of the car without telling me until I wanna saw when I was washing my car... I informed them about this incident and they said they would paint the part to match my car if it did need to WHICH THEY DID NOT and they did not offer replace the part when I came back into their shop..... Overall they have poor service< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< username>

< review>
The coffee is pretty good, and the location is convenient in the mall. It's the best coffee in the mall.

However the baristas can be a bit rude (they seemed exhausted every time I visited) and that was a consistent trend. There's also better coffee in Palo Alto, so unless you're shopping in the mall I would recommend looking around.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>First time at this location. Easy ordering and an entire wall of pixel glass separation of the entire store front. Seems like a lot of people ordered ahead of time but we ordered there and it was easy and safe.

We ordered the New Orleans Ice Coffee and a pour over. The Ice coffee was made with oats milk and was really good! Would definitely get again.

Staff was very nice.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Smaller version of the Blue Bottle on University, but equally great coffee and liege waffles (yum!). The ambiance is clean and sleek, and the service is fast and nice.

The avocado toast was also super fresh, a little more on the citric side, but the seeded toast itself was delicious.

They also offer alternative milks like Oat (Oatly), almond and soy milks.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDDcUjQ02GWlBADH4F2Ec2FsDYZXNC79jnzuf8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcIa_YPssLQtdEJfqPI2TIE1JXfKftdn--xGHR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmv3F_1uz0cU6LIVMAeZHacHbAPUQ88AX6lZZ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1VmOoKkfFUNqXE8wqvEWgwl1ShS-ZnWOqRerM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP1ow5oGgSbv9Rd1yF6VuRF6dowSTWNR2SxHRx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXDgby-O09YDK3JFwfmA8Fh14_LRmsDDgpOGxc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5jS7boEok95HtrUmduzYyfe1mcR72fJDdGN-Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmvs1R83JFifAzJHfFzFyZGhj0tz4W7RMAYqts=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtw0qTgxetPB5vG-gaXqg9qG9kIjgBZzAvFXeg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYGpItQA6OwssRmxmi1x6iZP6EnqFYFX1r7Xkf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Horrible, taste like I was drinking cleaning chemicals. Asked them to remake our coffees to hot chocolates and they generously did, but even the freaking hot chocolate tasted like kitchen cleaner.</Review>

Love Blue Bottle coffee - afaik this is only the second Blue Bottle in the Bay area ( the larger one being on University Ave in Palo Alto).
This place is clean, simple, and brews just as great coffee. Complimented with delicious snacks and bites.
Coffee takes time to craft but worth it.</review>

Beautiful - just like the pictures. Once you park, you can take a trail that is labeled "Garapatta Beach." I think the easiest way down (albeit a little longer) would be to take the stairs down to the beach, and then walk all the way right towards the stream of water joining the ocean. If you follow the stream up then you enter the valley.

Alternatively you take a right off the original fork in the park, which will take you on a path to the top of the valley. From here there are various ways to get down into the valley, albeit some are steep. Definitely a must see!<//Text>

<text>My visit in early March was rewarded with beautiful blooms.  Parking was easy and the Google map was spot on.   The trail length was only about a half mile putting you at a nice beach with sweeping views that are amazing.  The waves are dangerous, so be very careful because there is no place to run in high tide.  I was surprised at how many people were enjoying the trails, and how many of the lilies were trampled,  however it was still beautiful.< /text>< name>

< Review>
Amazing place, fill with calla lily. I hope people  will be considered and keep the place clean. Please pick up your trash and be mindful of living animals. There’s parking right before the bridge. Make sure you don’t go pass it. Enjoy and be kind to other. FYI it is a really short hike down to the valley. I would says about a quarter of a mile.< /Review>

<Review>I have been to this park many times.
I came back again on April/4/2021. Spring is the perfect time to be  visiting as the Calla Lillies and wildflowers are in full bloom.
Parked my car at  Gate 18 within Garrapata State Park and walked for 5 minutes down until I reached the set of stairs descending to the Calla Lilly Valley. The whole hike took me about half a mile roundtrip.
The Calla Lilly is such an elegant-looking flower and the epicenter of the valley's scenic bloom.
At any time of day, this place is beautiful…but the golden hour is at  sunset, as it is extra special then.
The phenomenon of scattering is also why the sky turns red, orange, and pink at sunset.
This is definitely one of the most picturesque coastal areas in Big Sur.<//Review>< time>

Must visit this place. Free roadside parking. No entry fee. Beach side area. Best time to visit on sunset time. Spring season is the right time to visit. We visited on March 27th.</review>

<Review>One of my favorite secret spots where I come to paint the Cala lilies.  When you see this for yourself, you won’t believe your eyes. There’s a little bubbling brook meandering through the lilies out to the crashing waves on the Garrapata beach. There is very little parking and no restrooms. FYI.<//Review>< user_name>

Very lovely! I bet it is peak season right now. Short walk down to the valley. No sign on the road. I saw that people picked the lilies on my way down.  Please don’t pick and ruin the experience for others.<//review>

The best time to visit is March. Try to be earlier in the day. You can park along the dirt pullout at Gate 19 of Garrapata State Park, near mile-marker 63, or on the other side of the bridge from the Garrapata State Park parking area.</Text>

Unfortunately it's been turned into a high traffic place to visit and many tourists have trampled on the beautiful plants. If you can come when it's not busy it is still very pretty and unique and even if the lillie's are not in bloom you can still see garrapata beach which is amazing!< /text>

The valley is a short walk from the highway and there were a few lillies in bloom even at the end of November. Beyond the lilly Valley is the stunning beach, pefrecr for a long walk or quiet contemplation. You could literally spend all day here.<//text><user_name>Aussie Traveller< /user_name><gmapID>0x808debcbc55f100b:0xcdd67e0aa15ea789</gmapID></record>

Gorgeous! This is an unmarked trailhead, you park along the highway. Pay close attention to Google maps as you approach the area and Google will take you right to the trailhead. You will likely see a few other cars parked on the side alerting you this is the location. Trailhead leads to stairs down into Calla Lilly Valley, less than five minute walk. You can also proceed another half mile down the road and park at the Garrupta State Beach sign, take the stairs to the beach, and then walk back along the beach to Calla Lilly Valley.<//text>

I don't know why this place has suddenly gotten so popular, must be instagram, but the influx of out-of-towners has destroyed this place. What once was a quiet spot is now crawling with tourists trampling the plants and leaving trash everywhere. Parking is straight-up dangerous at times. Everything beautiful eventually gets trampled around here.</text>

Hidden Gem of Highway 1.  Worth the walk from the road.  The lily area can be very muddy / slippery  depending on the amount of water flowing through the creek.  Outstanding place for photos on clear day.  Please do not pick the flowers.<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Blooming flowers in Calla Lily Valley
I like the calla lily, like its white flowers and green leaves [爱心][爱心] Here, the flowers are full of valleys, and the nearby creeks are clear to the bottom, gurgling, and not far away are like emerald The sea water, and the great waves that come and go 🌊 complement each other, it is a rare beauty...

We arrived early our rooms were not ready. We headed to Marina Kitchen and had a couple of light plates. You can never go wrong with their chicken Caesar salad, we also had their Reuben sandwich and Turkey BLT sandwich
The service was being excellent. Abe was the best waiter you could have. It is really nice place overlooking the pool. They have music at night Friday and Saturday< /Text>

Nice in resort restaurant. The service is great. Food is good but a little pricey. We stayed for a week at the Marriott and this place was busy all week. Awesome selections of high end scotch and bourbons. They also have a wine tasting room.< /review>

I ordered a farmer’s plate, and received a bowl of noodles with broth a couple of mushrooms and a couple leaves of some other vegetables.  My husband and I thought they got the order wrong but didn’t see our server when it was delivered so we just let it go & decided they were loosely using “vegetable plate” with this dish.  We will not be returning, there are far too many decent restaurants in San Diego that can deliver great views.<//Review>< Pics>

Visited on Fri I believe. Service is typically above par. Prices are appropriate. Similar to a cafe in Las Vegas I loved.</text>

Highly recommend partaking in any one of the many wine focused events Marina Kitchen puts on. Very knowledgeable sommeliers and servers and a fantastic setting. The schedule seems to change, so call beforehand, but last time we went we were able to do an individual tasting in front of the impressive wine room, while enjoying some charcuterie and small bites. Very intimate and well catered to the individual taste. Fabulous food and drinks.</Review>

< Review>
This restaurant is located inside the Marriott with a view of the harbor. The atmosphere is great and you are close to the water and can get a great view depending on where you sit, they also have a decent bar which is probably the better part of the restaurant. We ordered a ceasar salad and a burger and though the food came out great it's nothing really over the top or fancy just another salad and simple burger for higher than normal prices because it's located in a hotel. The service was also top notch, but I was disappointed to see for such an expensive hotel that they didn't have better options. I have seen food trucks that offer much more in terms of selection and creativity.<//Review>

<review>I joined my sister who was here on job assignment with a huge client. Her co-workers decided to have a drink at Marina Bar. I made sure to let our server Lisa, know as soon as I sat down, to separate my check from them... Since corporate is paying their drinks/meals. We were not leaving, but my check was given to me with an 18% service charge. When I asked the server what it was for, she said it's because I was with a party of 6 or more. I reminded her that I was not part of the party and had requested a separate check. Her response was "Oh so you didn't have to pay service charge?!". This was extremely inappropriate and uncalled for. Lisa needs to work on her customer service skills. I have traveled around the world and stayed in hundreds of hotels...this was very unprofessional. I will not be recommending Marriott Marquis in San Diego when asked where to stay or dine here. There are many other hotels with excellent customer service.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Staff were nice. The place is clean and has a nice view. It took sometime before someone acknowledged us but she was very nice. I only give 2 stars because their food did not taste good and the drinks are just ok. For the price they can do a better job. We went to eat here because we had a restaurant credit. Otherwise we would have walked and went to a different restaurant instead. I hope that they can improve because it is such a nice hotel.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80d953512dc05e69:0x7b01b7bfb517f653<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Came here for Mother's Day brunch, so this review is a bit overdue. When I had made the reservations, I did not realize that for Mother's Day brunch, their only service was buffet style and we were expected full table service. I looked at my confirmation and this was not indicated anywhere, but we made the most of it and we weren't disappointed.

This restaurant is located inside Marriott and we walked through their beautiful lobby to get to it. The restaurant is also very large, spacious, and with a few separate dining areas. It was a bit pricey.. But there was a wide variety of food options, fresh and high quality. My kids took full advantage of their waffles and unlimited Nutella. LoL. There was also seafood, an omelette station as well as a crepe station. Plenty of fresh fruit and bite size desserts as well.

Some parts of the restaurant had a lovely view of the marina. After brunch, we were able to sneak outside and take a stroll by the water and the hotel's lovely pool area while keeping our car with valet. This can be a little tricky though, because their doors require a hotel room key to return inside.. it was a busy Sunday afternoon, so we were just lucky we were able to go out and back in without trouble.< /review>

For Marriott I was disappointed. Stopped for lunch and the food was definitely blow what I am used to having at a Marriott.  The roast beef sandwich I had was called and the au jus was bland and flavorless.  The banana split sunday was placed on top of some rubbery substance that couldn't be eaten.  Definitely not worth the wait doe the food or the price I paid. Love the Marriott homeland am a Bonvoy member with over 1/2 million points but not eating there again.< /review>

While the portions are small, they are sized appropriately. I had Panco crusted Ahi tuba that was the best I have had in years. It was like velvet. Additionally the soup was great. I had lobster bisque. Cesar salad was good. The butter dish was very good as well.</review>

The service was ok, but I got the All-American burger and it was simply not good. It was both lacking in flavor, and had a little too much of some spice that didnt belong. It had a spicy aftertaste but other than that was pretty bland and just greasy. I am also from the midwest, so that may play a factor. Definitely not a $20 burger though.<//Review>

<review>We came  here to celebrate my 1st Mother's Day but we had an awful experience. We wait for the host for 15 minutes and then when she came she didn't even greet us, no eye contact even a smile. She make a phone call and answer another call rather than assisting us. After that we told her we have a reservation and told us that we need to wait for 20 minutes because they have only 2 servers and there's a big group just came before us. What's the point of having a reservation. And also we put some remarks that we need a baby chair and window spot but it's all useless to put remarks and reservation in advance. I'm so disappointed. We got our dessert so late because they told that they have a private event. I got a  bad stomach ache after the dinner... Mother's Day nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Best breakfast in downtown San Diego. I ate here this morning with four friends. Between the five of us, I think we had some of everything. I really loved the bruschetta french toast and omelette station. My omelette was perfect, best I've had in years! Their mini muffins were amazing. They had three different types including a banana/chocolate chip and orange/cranberry. So yummy. The biscuits and gravy was a miss, but everything else was so well done! The bacon was think cut and cooked perfectly (for me). The service was great, too, and I'm certain if I'd asked for bacon well-done, they would've brought it out to me for no extra charge. All this and $7 cheaper than the Hilton Bayside's breakfast buffet. YUM!!< /Text>

<review>Let’s talk about the good thing first. our server Sam was amazing, loved her friendly and SHE gets a five star...

Your restaurant however does not... who in their right mind fries Gnocci and doesn’t think to inform the customer about it.. the Gnocci was an odd square shape with a fried crusted exterior, heavily over seasoned, the tomato sauce is more like a tomato paste terrible taste and the Parmesan espuma was anything but that... :/ not what I was expecting from the Marquis.. very unimpressed</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< review>
Horrible Service.  Sat at a table for 1.5 hours without any acknowledgement from any staff.   Had only 2 interactions with my waitress.   Once was to take our order, after being flagged down.  The second was to drop off our order.   After that, nothing.  Didn’t check up on our table or anything.    Spent time at other tables but not ours.  The chances of us coming back are between zero and none.<//review>

Small portions and bland for a steep price. In other words, a typical hotel restaurant.<//Review>

We enjoyed the 4th of July Buffet. The food was excellent and the service was excellent, however we had no knowledge of the 18% service charge on our bill (for dining only we were not guests). I tried looking all over their website to see if it was disclosed and it wasn't. We tipped at 20% for excellent service, which we had. I'm a planner and budget for nice meals that we can enjoy as a family so getting kicked in the gut for an undisclosed service charge was a little disappointing. Pay your employees more so the cost doesn't trickle down to consumers OR DISCLOSE it. Also we had to pay for our two year old to eat at a buffet which he literally ate $3 worth of food. Despite having great seats to watch the fireworks there are more cost effective way to do so on July 4th. The food was good but not worth doing it again. It also cost $35 for parking but their hourly rate would have been cheaper. The machine charged us for all day parking. Had I known that I would have spent more time around the marina.</review>

< Review>
I went to this restaurant for a late dinner. My previous experience at this restaurant was good, expect for the first night our waitress Brianna, wanted us to pay for our food 5 minutes after receiving it because it was time for her shift to end. What happened to allowing us to finish dinner than receiving the check?  On Nov 28, I was treated poorly by the hostess at the bar,who told me I had to pay for my food first before I could eat in the lounge, so I decided to sit in the lounge to wait on a hostess to place an order. Well, I was ignored by three hostess in the lounge area, who helped the table behind me but ignored me, so after sitting there for at least 15 minutes, I went to the bar and placed my order. Let me add, I am an black female and the hostesses were another ethnicity. Also the table who they served without an issue, were also another ethnicity other than black. After receiving my food from the rude hostess from the bar, the same three hostesses continued to ignore me. I was so upset with my experience, I left the restaurant and contacted the manager from the restaurant about my horrible experience. Which he stated it was a simple mistake. The restaurant was not full,so there was no excuse for this type of behavior from the hostesses. I am from the south and I have never experienced everyday racism until I visited this restaurant. I contacted via Marriott corporate office about the incident but they only offered an apology and 10,000 Marriott points through email after, I asked someone to contact me via phone to discuss the incident. The lack of verbal communication shows me, they were not interested in discussing the incident nor care about their Marriott members, especially people of color.< /Review>

Despite the distance we wanted him to know we were all thinking of him! I called the restaurant and spoke with Mike the Supervisor. He TRUELY went above and beyond, making accommodations and sending my husband a complimentary drink and snack to his room from us! It was waiting for him when he returned for the night! Thank you so much!!<//Review></record>

Burrata Cheese ($14) is served with tomato jam, speck, and toasted bread. The burrata is like a creamy cloud of cheese. It’s so soft and mild, it pairs well with the tomato jam and speck, adding both sweet and salty notes. The toasted bread is the perfect delivery vehicle for this starter. Rating: 5/5

Seafood Salad ($19) is Dungeness crab, rock shrimp, and Maine lobster atop gem lettuce and avocado green goddess dressing. It’s the perfect spring/summer salad to enjoy while overlooking the lush tropical pool area. The crab, shrimp, and lobster are cooked to perfection, each with their own unique flavor notes of sweet and briny flavors. The dressing has a nice flavor and lends itself nicely to the seafood, adding flavor without overpowering. Rating: 5/5

Brandt Beef Flat Iron ($26.50) is a grilled flat iron steak topped with herb butter and served with arugula salad and truffle fries. This has to be the best flat iron steak around! The steak has the tender texture of filet mignon but with subtle marbling. The knife cuts through like butter. The herb butter adds an herbal essence bringing out the sweetness of the beef. The truffle fries are so aromatic and highly addictive indeed; crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside with truffle flavor and aroma in every bite. Rating: 5/5

Maker’s Mark Milkshake ($14) is served with maple lacquered pepper bacon. It has a creamy texture from the ice cream. The Maker’s Mark bourbon packs a punch but lends a caramel-like flavor to the shake. The added bacon shakes things up with a little bit of salty. This also won the “Best Dessert” at the San Diego Bay Food & Wine Festival. Rating: 5/5< /Review>

Delicious! Just ordered and, while I’m still eating it, their hot and sour soup is great!!! I even called them one time to give complements to the chef about how yummy they make it. All of the food is made perfectly and I can’t be happier. If I had to say anything negative at all it’s just that I wish the Door Dash app for them would give options about customizing the dishes... like if I could make the soup even better I would ask for more meat(even though the amount they give is normal and fine) and I would also ask, as an option, to be able to make it even spicier(but without adding more seeds)... the seeds are my only peeve, but I understand, they have to be added, just saying you can spice it up super easy with just a little super-hot hot sauce like Dave’s Insanity Sauce(which is what I mix with apple cider vinegar(2 parts vinegar 1 part hot sauce))... makes it even better! Love this restaurant!<//review>

< review>
Our second order from this restaurant and pretty much everything that we ordered and liked the first time came out to be tasteless this time. The salt and pepper chicken was over fried and didn’t have neither spices that are in its name. The szechuan chicken was sweet, really sweet. No flavors in the rice and chow mein as well. Wouldn’t recommend as it’s not consistent. One good thing is that their portion sizes are huge.</review>

Someone on Next door recommended Uncle Yu, and damn. I'm happy they did. I've been here three times in the last two months. Their portions are huge, food is made fresh and fast, and prices are very reasonable.

I recommend the Orange Chicken, char Sui chow mein, and the beef chow fun.<//Text></record>

The orange chicken is excellent. We also had the prawns with lobster sauce which was very tasty. The salt and pepper pork chops was tender and tasty. The portions are large and the price is reasonable. Will definitely go back again.</review>

Ordered takeout - got vegetable chow menu, and vegetable fried rice. Both were excellent! Lots of fresh and crunchy veggies. The fried rice is one of the best I've had in the Bay Area. The portion size was very good and lasted 4 servings. I would order from here again.< /text>

<Review>I have been here twice and order to go once, I would say the food is definitely below par; it's either too salty or oily. The beef fried rice was OK (not good, but OK), Mongolian beef was too salty, orange chicken tasted like they were submerged in some sort of oil even with sauce on top. The service was decent however and the restaurant was close to where I work, and they usually aren't too busy even at lunch time.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

The food has gone way down since the new owners took over. I've very disappointed on how poor the food quality is now. This used to be one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in town. I won't be back. Now time to look for a new Chinese food restaurant :/< /text>

It has good iced coffee. There's nothing wrong with it, other than Starbucks burning their beans. The last two times I bought coffee this didn't happen, so perhaps they've committed to swapping out filters regularly. I've been to coffee shops that are better. Please note this is review applies to all Starbucks coffee shops. You've been to one, you've been to them all. Their green tea peach lemonade is very good. A+ product.< /text>

I was just passing through when I needed some caffeine and decided to stop at this Starbucks and, although it's nice to see that the local special needs population has a place to work, was served the worst cup of coffee in my life. The staff was rude and needs more training on dealing with the public.<//Text>

This particular  Starbucks is inside the Albertson's on China Lake Blvd. in Ridgecrest, CA.  It's small but still has seating area, you can order your coffee do your shopping then pick-up your coffee to go.< /Review>

<text>Best mechanic I've known. He has taken care of our V70 and S60 for about 12 years. Does great work and is always very honest and clear about what you should fix and what you REALLY should fix. Volvo should thank him. I've spoken with so many other customers who say he's the reason they stick with their Volvo. Actually..Volvo might want us to buy new ones.<//text>< pics>

<text>Nino is a kind,. honest and proficient Volvo mechanic.  Did I mention honest?  Anyone who owns a Volvo of a certain age deserves someone like Nino working on their car(s).

Nino is a rare breed and will do a good job.</text>< Time>

Nino was my go to person many years ago when he worked in Santa Monica.  When he left oh, I was very sad. We looked for him for a long time and by accident we found his new shop. I really haven't kept up the Volvo since he stopped working on it. But now my daughter is driving it I wanted it to be perfect and I needed someone I could trust. I am very, very, very happy with his service. I just wish his shop was in a bigger place and he needs a bigger sign so we can find it but he is absolutely the best mechanic in the world. He is very patient and takes his time to explain things to you. He absolutely does not look down on women. He is very, very kind. Because we haven't taken care of the Volvo for a long time, it had a lot of work that had to be done. But my daughter was over-the-top happy when she got the car back. It's 15 years old and it runs as good as the first day.  If I could give 1000 Stars I would.</Text>

I am so grateful for Nino (and his team) - his knowledge of Volvos is supreme, his work is superlative and he's the best of people - friendly, honest, full of integrity. Nino earns five stars and then some at every visit.<//Review>

Simply one of the best shops around.  You never have to worry about Nino's trying to do unnecessary work to make more $--they are scrupulously honest.

The quality of the work is first rate, and they will always spend time with you discussing and explaining the work and the car's condition.<//review>

Look no further if you are looking for an independent Volvo shop who is honest, does unbelievable quality work and who will treat you with the utmost respect. Nino and his staff are incredibly knowledgeable and honest. I have taken my old 97 Volvo here several times for some major work. They price they quoted me was very fair, the work was high quality and they got it done a lot faster than I expected! Even when Nino was busy he always made time to fit me in for whatever issue my car was having.

I will never bring my Volvo anywhere else but here and if you own a Volvo, you shouldn't take it anywhere else either!!< /Review>

He is the most honest mechanic I have ever come across. His rates are also the lowest you will find in LA. You don't need to negotiate, because he always gives you a discount and throws in free stuff. He changed my cooling fluid reservoir and threw in a wheel alignment for free. (I didn't even know those things needed fixing.)

He answers the phone, so sometimes you'll get his voicemail. Be patient and call again in a couple of hours.

I will keep my Volvo as long as he is in business!< /Review>

<name>Richard Taxe<//name><text>My 2006 Volvo V70 was not running smoothly so I took it to Culver City Volvo and
paid for a Diagnostic Test.  I was told I needed a transmission and that the cost would be about $5,000.  I than took the car to a transmission shop and was told that
the transmission needed new fluids but appeared to be okay. The transmission was not the problem.  I took it to Santa Monica Volvo where we purchased the car but had a bad service experience years earlier because I was told they had new owners.
I  agreed to pay  $775.00 for a 100,000 mile service and when I came to pick up the
car they told me that it needed at least $4,200.00 in repairs ( a new computer, a fuel
pump, new wiring because rats ate it etc. They suggested that I should probably get a new car and to bring it to their used car lot and see what they would give me for a
trade in.  I looked on my computer for a Volvo mechanic in my area and came across
Nino's. His reviews were unbelievably great. I spoke to him on the phone and brought
my car in a few days later. I told him to fix whatever he could so that it could run okay for the next year or two even if it cost a couple of thousand dollars.  The car was ready two days later and I had tears in my eyes when I left.  The problem was a fuel
sensor, and it needed read brakes and rotors. Nino charged me $469.00. I had finally
found an honest mechanic. The car runs great.  From the bottom of my heart I promise you that Nino is someone you should meet if you have a Volvo that needs work done. He is a very special person who won't take advantage of you. Richard
whatever is needed at a fair price. Richard< /text>< Rate>

Went to Nino after getting a price for repairs from the dealership and I saved just under $1200. Not only that but he's honest and only recommends what you need and not what he wants to sell you in order to make more  money. And my car was ready when he said it would be. So if you need to get your Volvo worked on, hit up Nino.</text>

Even though he was swamped, Nino took us in on a Saturday morning and took a look at the car and replaced the battery (the alternator was fine). He only works some Saturdays, so be sure to call ahead. He knows Volvos extremely well and we have been very pleased with all of the work he's done on the car.<//Review>< Pictures>

My daughter's Volvo broke down while she was in Santa Monica. The Volvo dealer was not much help, but Nino spent a lot of time diagnosing the problem and helping us determine the best course of action. Since the car had a lot of miles and some significant repairs needed we ended up not having Nino fix the car. Nino was very helpful and thorough, and didn't charge for his diagnosis. Excellent service.</Text>

i thought about it, and knowing i could not afford that, i asked him to rebuild it.
he told me it would be expensive and i said it wouldn't be as expensive as a new car and i knew if he rebuilt it, it would be as good as new. and besides, whenever anything goes wrong, i know i can trust him to tell me the truth.
he's amazing. trustworthy. honest. and takes the time to listen to me. i have such respect for him and i always trust what he tell me. i am blessed to have known him since he was the hot shot manager at santa monica volvo where he used to wear a dress suit. now he gets down and dirty fixing the cars and he and martin really take care of their customers. i can't say enough good things about them.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>My posts are usually very good however, lately you only give me a tiny rectangular box that I can barely fit three short sentences inside of it!!!
WHAT'S HAPPENING ☹✌?
COLD STONE Creamery has some of the best homemade ice cream that I've ever tested!
I'll finish this review after I return a few more times!</review>< gmap_id>

This store is terrible. We thought we'd give it another chance. They still didn't have waffle bowls with sprinkles and barely and waffle bowls or cones at all. It was very warm in the store. The store looks dirty with hand made sloppy unprofessional signs. So now they won't be making custom cakes. They didn't have any ice cream cupcakes. I was rushed through my order even though I was the only person in the store. My order was prepared so quickly, the brownie was barely cut so it was a giant glob in the middle. This was taken 1 minute after exiting the store, super soft and melted and this is a Love It. It barely filled the cup. Such a disappointment. We will not go back.< /Text>

I've come here almost everyday, sometimes twice a day, since I discovered this gem. I always get the mango milkshake, although all their flavors are amazing. They have the traditional favorites, along with a more exotic variety. The creamy rose water is incredible, tastes like a rose macaron.<//text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Purchased and ice cream cake from cold stone with the impression that this would be the best place ever because of the name.  I was deeply disappointed after spending $34 dollars on this medium cake.  As you can see in the picture it is mostly cake with a small sliver of ice cream.  I would  have assumed that an ice cream shop would emphasize their product over a bakery product and vice versa.  If I would have bought this from a bakery  then I would expect make cake.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaxanYrGkN_b5BeDZ7Dlf4m4PZ-tyRi_5mPVwe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

As soon as you walk in, there's an overwhelming stench.
The floors have arrows telling you where to go just in case, but the floors are sticky.
Maybe invest in a good cleaning crew?< /review>

Icecream is tasteful, but quite expensive $2.79 per scoop, got 2 scoops, plus a waffle cone. 1 icecream cone for $6.36! What surprises me is the portions, too small for the price!</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I gave this 1 star because the store has only been open 1 time for me to enjoy ice cream with my family. Today was the third and last time I will go to a Cold Stone Creamery because this store does not operate as a professional business should. They close their doors for lunch. What kind of Ice Cream place closes for lunch? They also closed their doors today for a ‘grocery run and lunch’. Very unprofessional operation. If this is a privately owned Cold Stone, the boys in suits who sit on the board should rethink this particular location and it’s owner.</review>< Pics>

<Text>My husband and I went here for some ice cream today. There were 4 people in front of us.. we never got a hello or I’ll be right with you! Finally we pick out the ice cream we want there’s about 5 girls working there gossiping and only 1 of them is actually working!! The girl with the blue hair rang us up she didn’t talk to us at all! We get Into the car and my husband pulls out a LONG BLUE HAIR out of his ice cream! We both were very disgusted on top of the poor customer service we had do we Went in for a refund never an apology or how can I make this better for you? Instead after we walked in for the refund all the girls were in the back showing something on their phones instead of coming to the front and tending to customers! I will never ever come here again. WHAT HAPPENED TO HAIRNETS IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY???< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>This place is alright. I got a medium mint flavor with the toffee candy mixed in...it was fine. The ice cream is on the softer side, which is okay due to the mix in, but it can melt quickly.

Staff is okay, they made it fairly quickly and it was ready by the time I finished paying.< /text>< pictures>

When there is a very long line of people waiting to order, it's a sign that it must be good. Make it a point to enjoy some ice cream in this place and I'm sure you'll be delighted.</review>

<review>It got very busy at about 9 pm.  It was the only one cream place open that late.  I have a hard time with the value proposition of Cold Stone.  I just believe it is very over priced in most markets.  In California, it is par for the course expensive.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user>

This place works the same way a Subway would.  You come in choose you flavor and then your mixture/toppings. They put the ice cream on a cold grill and put in whatever you want to mix in there (cookies, peanuts, gummies, chocolate pieces,  etc) they mix it together and put it in your cup or cone. They do a great job and their ice cream is really delicious! If you don't feel like waiting in line they have a fridge with ice cream tubs ready to be bought.</Review>

Been there 3 times; I get over charged each time and when I point it out; they gladly correct it. It is like 35% overcharging that anyone would pay attention would easily pick! Don't know why but I am assuming it is mainly lack of training their employees which is a management issue. Clean branch but unfriendly staff.</text>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Cold Stone just has so many damn flavors of ice cream. Its so tough to go there and try and pick. What's crazy to me is seeing people come in and order the BIG container of ice cream. This thing has to be like $7 or $8 and its got to be the most ice cream Ive ever seem smashed into a cup, falling over the side. I was trying to imagine how fattening that was...but I couldnt get over how someone could eat that much ice cream in one sitting. LOL. Yes its good and flavorful, but thats a lot...!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>SUPER SCARY AND CREEPY Experience

Best Coldstone turned into the worst, The Mission Valley Fenton Parkway location. There are good employees at this Coldstone, but we went in there a few nights ago and were treated unfairly. Employee overcharged us, and then another gave us a smaller total. We received a refund on the spot and an excuse why it happened, but no apology. The second thing that happened was my ice cream didn't go over the lid of the cup, yet the cover is rounded. It looked like it was half empty. She said that is how much is supposed to be in there. I told her I will shop somewhere else for $6 ice cream if the portions were so little. She then said all Cold Stones serve it that way. I then said I wouldn't go to any ColdStone that would not even fill the cup. They later with attitude said Have a nice night three separate times, and then when the door was closing behind us, one said "have the night you deserve". Which is weird and rude.

I later made a complaint to the cold stone website. I didn't want to make a google review based on one experience. The next day I get an apology from Jerry the franchise owner. He invited me in to talk about it, and to offer me a treat. I wasn't planning on it, I let my money do my talking (stop buying from them). But here is where the story gets scary and creepy.

I made the mistake of giving my phone number in the complaint, ( thought I could answer any questions if he had them.)

Jerry gave my complaint to the employees working that night without removing my personal information.

11pm I get a phone call from an unrecognized phone number

Girl : Hello is this Steve?
Me:  Yes
Girl: I wanted to let you know that I just found out my husband is sleeping with your partner.
Me: Who is this
Girl: I don't want to say, I just wanted you to know.
Me: Who is he?
Girl: I can't say (hung up)

I then talked to my fiancé what happened, and we were both really upset and confused.

I called back, and she asked that I stopped harassing her?????  after awhile I figured it could be one of the girls at Cold Stone and texted her to meet me there for some free ice cream that the owner offered me. She said she didn't want to meet me or my Wh@RE.

Today I go see Jerry at Cold Stone, Told him that I received a phone call from someone who works here and he seemed confused. I asked him if the phone number was one of his employees, and he confirmed it was one of the girls that he showed my complaint to. I told him what happened and he said he would talk to her. HE offered me ice cream, I turned it down. (goodbye cakebatter ice cream)

I wrote him an email thanking him for his time, and that I am worried about any further retaliation. He said he talked to the employee and doesn't feel that there will be anymore problems. Maybe she is a relative to the owner, and won't get fired.

I told him that this representative was trying to destroy my relationship, and she represents his personal business and coldstone. I also think this person has gone way over the line and should be fired.

I wasn't planning a google review, but it seems that he didn't really care enough about my issue to show me any resolve. I would avoid this coldstone.

This story is scary and 100% correct, I have emails and text messages and recorded conversations to prove it. IT is a completely strange story that I wish I made up.

. I do hope he fires this crazy girl, for who knows what she is willing to do.< /review><pictures>None</pictures></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I really wanted to eat my favorite snow, but I was very disappointed, the banana was green and bitter when I saw I told the girl and she said that the other was the same, 6.98 dollars thrown in the trash :(

<Text>I returned some shoes and didn’t want to exchange them for anything else at the time, so the the cashier gave me a receipt for store credit. Since then I’ve tried to use store credit numerous times towards other purchases and every time they tell me they can’t accept any store credit because of a system upgrade. Why is that my problem? This has been going on for months. What kinda company doesn’t accept store credit that they issued to a customer. I even tried emailing their customer service and I get no response. It’s basically like shoe palace has stolen $125 from me at this point.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

And when I got  to the register the girl was just laughing and giggling with her co worker. It wasn't busy enough for them to not give great customer service. The only girl who was nice and asked if I need help  was Jessica I believe that was her name.</review>< pics>

I have never written a review online before.  I tried to return shoes today that I bought on March 23, I realize that I passed the 14 day return policy but the website said it was a 30 day return policy. They refused to let me return the shoes.  I've been having health issues and I live far so I drove there today and the employees were so rude.  I notice that is the same experience everyone has and the manager keeps saying that it is an isolated experience and to give the store a second chance.  This is your opportunity manager to contact me and let me return the shoes. Thank you.<//review>

I do not even give them a full star. The manager there Darnell is very rude and disrespectful to his employees as well as customers.I would not recommend anyone go there.. After he was rude to me and my kids he told us to get out of his store I told him I want his supervisors number and he said " Yeah after you get out of my store". My kids are only 8 and 6 both terrified of the way this guy was treating people!! Never again..<//Review>

<text>I just had egg rolls, spicy black pepper with chicken, white rice and it was phenomenal. Everything arrived on time, still hot as if it the kitchen was next door, and tasted amazing. As (my) luck would have it, I just found out about this place and I'll be moving from this neighborhood in a month. The plan going forward? Order some more before I leave the area and if it's just as great, I'll make the drive to get more! Try this place, it's great.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNI710_HciENS3kcwlH45r1iUg-4Mpnk0EL8MhF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmIRN7idfz39zN6rECvJXPyzLc_75AuZ_6TrIo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0mqEbx-cHM_qCqUjYQBR0NOunPXCgGSkjvoYG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm9rshB8DoHVeodwEQC7csbUPjsYCQzVsSEfMI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4vlFUbPmuE3JC2-6uYW30R8pPFPTsI8TxxwkX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNI3nVy45Jb7tUjWFunCythBxviFI1n_VNREIAh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5IXgPLcFP6-STBRo09Vn4AuvUzEidj0GU7lFZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN03cfCCBGDa06vDLGE08y9T8a95oj_Y1XmIALs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlk5BiNiWSI4t-R4kf8m_ss0jNjoQnCAS04ler=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4lGYrkaJuV80pGTsvui56BWOFLBlURVJQB8VC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONwi9KvrZQaFz4DZSzZ0xZGn5oeThFHGm23Wxt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-4H-Ko2yNQ_5SHfwEacPLfkWstmiILUjO8icp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Came here for late lunch on a Sunday,

As of this date, they're still offering OUT DOOR dining. (2 tables outside)

I really enjoy that they have lunch specials 7 days a week! (Typically not on weekends)

Papaya salad: I asked for hot, and a bit sweeter than usual. Got a good kick, not for amateur spice eaters. Really fresh veggies.

Beef salad: medium, wish I got it in hot. (We wanted to see the difference b/n hot and medium). None the less, again, super fresh veggies and beef was cooked well. Would like to see more asian/aromatic veggies to enhance the dish.

Pad thai- Got the lunch special. Portion is decent for lunch. I was skeptical about how watery the sauce/texture was at first, but the flavor makes up for the doubt. Sauce eventually thickened and it was really good.

Service: really kind, and I appreciate that they wore masks and upheld the covid rules while still giving good service.

Will be back!< /Review>< username>

<Text>I'm a little picky about my red curry and this is really good! It has good flavor. I liked the Thai tea and papaya salad. I got delivery and everything was great. I had special requests for my curry (no peas, carrots) and it was made the way I asked for it. Awesome, will be back!< /Text>< Pictures>

Great food and services. The place was busy with to-go orders, but they took their time to get the orders ready and make sure all of the orders are correct. All of the food I ordered came in a good portion and it was delicious. Will definitely come again next time!< /Review>

Staff was nice and place looked clean. I got a free Thai Iced Tea with my order (pad thai, pineapple fried rice, fried crab wanton), so that was a pleasant surprise. Food was good, as expected. I've ordered there before and would definitely order from them again! I would have pics, but I'm reviewing this a day after I ordered cause Yelp told me to review today and not the day of the order, lol. Next time!</review>

Small and clean restaurant. Good service. The Thai Tea is really good! We ordered the Spicy Noodle with Chicken and the Pad Thai with chicken both medium spicy level. I personally liked the spicy noodle more. I think if you like spicy, go for the hot spicy level the medium was very mild for us.<//Review>

I drive all the way to AM Thai to get some lunch specials of Pad See Eww for $7.95 and 2 orders of Orange Chickens for my 4 yr old daughter.. cuz she loves this chicken!!

Either dining in or taking out, the Employees are always friendly and they make sure you are treated right.

During the weekdays, the lunch hours between 11:30am-2pm are not so busy, so if you are near by, make sure to visit AM to get your lunch specials.. FOR $7.95! it's really good stuff and right amount of flavor they make.

I ordered a Pad See Eww lunch special and 2 orders of regular orange chickens, and my order came out within 10 minutes.. and my to go orders were ready right before I was done with my food, packaged nicely in a plastic bag.

For Thai food near Anaheim, I can't find anywhere else than Am.
They have a relatively large parking lot, and they are right next to the Indian Cuisine.

Their restroom is clean and organized, and they can serve as many as 10+ people on their long tables inside.

Good food, good price, and friendly employees should never go wrong.
will be back for more Thai next month!</Text>

<Text>I love that there's a good Thai restaurant right next to my work! One of the main reasons why I come here is because of their lunch special. It's about 8 dollars and it's very delicious in flavors!

I decided to come for dinner with my girlfriend because we both crave thai food all the time! No joke. There's quite of few thai places in Buena Park, this one is actually one of the better ones.

My order was the spicy basil, so bomb! Flat noodles with basil, bell pepper, onion, chili and chicken. It has so many flavors and the portion size was big enough for two people! I really enjoyed that dish. Anything with basil will get me drooling!

My girl ordered the Rad Nah , that dish is flavorful and just right on a cold night. It's like a soup gravy thai flavored flat noodle dish served with chicken and broccoli.

Order some appetizers while you're there! Cream cheese wonton will not disappoint. I'm kinda sad I forgot to check in for a free egg roll on yelp!! I'm just being fat. Haha.< /Text>< user_name>

We discovered this place a few months ago and keep coming back. The service is excellent and the food comes out a few minutes after ordering. We order the spicy basil with beef and spicy eggplant with pork. The flavors are delicious and the portions are large. I never know what spice level to choose when ordering for the first time. They have mild, medium, spicy, very spicy and extremely spicy. We chose very spicy and it was perfect. It gets the nose running, a little sweat below the eyes and on the forehead. I drink a few glasses of water to tone down the heat.

Enjoy!<//Text>

<text>There was a thin metal shard/piece inside the chicken satay. It was sharp and could have cut me have I eaten it. Notified the owner who stated she could not guarantee that there won't be metal pieces in the food. Would not recommend due to hazards in your food.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd291420c2246d:0xfb534ff8f21a76f2< /Gmap_id></record>

I will not order from this place again. The quality of food is so poor. I would put ZERO star if I can. Egg roll tasted pre-made and just warm up in microwave. Curry is so watery. They just add some color in in. It shouldn't matter if you dine in or order to go. Food should taste great at all time!</Review>

< Review>
First time at this restaurant and didn't know what to expected. I had spicy noodles and Thai coffee with boba, and they were full of flavors. Spicy noodles was cooked exactly correct in taste and level of hotness.  It was not too hot and the noodles were not too soft. The coffee had the right amount of sweet, and the boba was not hard. The people were nice and friendly. My server was vegetarian and recommended lemon tofu salad that I bought to take home. I recommend anybody who wants to eat authentic Thai food to check out this place.< /Review>

Food Is goood but I've had a good and bad experiences with two diff servers. One was nice and other was giving me this weird vibe/stare. And it was $9.03 and she was trying to give me literally 97cents despite my generous tip. Smh. The other server is cool though, but not going to tip generously for the other lady, that's for sure< /text>

4 shrimp in my extra charge tadpi noodles and none in my extra charge Wong Tong Soup. I tried thus place due my regular place is closed on Monday. It just didn't taste spicy authentic in any dish I ordered very bland?? Nice building. Order to go person did not speak great English and hung up on me and my girl friend had to call 10mins later to speak with some else who could take an order. I don't know if I'll ever be back.<//text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Ordered delivery from here for the first time and ordered way more than I could eat.
Initially, I’d say I fell in love with the place. I’m a HUGE fan of Tom Ka, and this place has a noodle soup version which was spectacular.
But, be careful when ordering take out or delivery, because besides this, they sent me an incorrect item. Small mistake, but just be careful. I ordered a green curry with beef and side of white jasmine rice.
I received a red seafood curry, and the rice way WAY undercooked.
Again, it’s a forgiving mistake, but I hope future visits won’t cause me the inconvenience in the future.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dd291420c2246d:0xfb534ff8f21a76f2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

All I have to say is try their Super "S" wings, you will not regret. Oh and just about everything on the menu is out of control good. The prices are fair, portion size is great and the freshness and flavor really sing at this place. Stop by, but like, really stop by and try their food, you will find that their friendly demeanor speaks volumes about this place too. The food there... geez, just writing this takes me back to the first time I went and how I pretty much fell in love with this spot hahahaha go try them :)</Text>

Really clean and cute thai restaurant. Portions are huge and the prices are fair. I recommend the spicy noodles with shrimp. Tom yum soup is so flavorful and spicy. Usually when I order spicy at other thai restaurants, it's never spicy enough but this place makes it 🔥🔥🔥🔥. My favorite thai place in OC!<//Text>

<Review>I found food here is not really consistent. First time we went, the noodle was so soggy but the calamari was so good, the batter was thin and crispy. Now the second time, the noodle was better, it was chewy but I was very disappointed with the calamari, the batter is so thick and not crispy.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dd291420c2246d:0xfb534ff8f21a76f2<//gmapID></record>

<review>Coming to California after the weed had been legalized, I was super excited about the whole thing.

First of all, I was thrilled to see the concept of church of cannabis. The whole setup - exterior, waiting in the “church hall”, mass, everything was adding to my thrill.

The whole process was very smooth and fast. The staff was helpful and guided throughout.

Their collection or rather display wasn’t as big as some of the other weed dispensaries I tried. Nonetheless, they had all the good stuff. We took papaya and girls scout.

Plus, they give, people registering for the first time, goodies as well (a free pre-rolled joint). Don’t forget to ask for it!!<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiwnaVEGvGjKsEmjh8ci26z7o2XkBwbg2bT49K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCpiiNAsC_5QDxAU9B2Cg8uwWwGAUxpA9g-RUF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I was asked by a client to research Churches in Northern California, particularly those that are Rastafarian.  My contract and assignment have concluded so I felt the need to post my thoughts on this place.
Based on pictures, reviews, and additional analysis of other Rastafarian Churches, I went there assuming this would be on my top 3 list.  Sadly it was NOT.  The property was beautiful but the staff were less than friendly and the energy felt FAKE and somewhat pretentious.  Given my experience elsewhere, I didn't anticipate walking in and feeling like it was more about the SALE than spiritual experience.  If I want simply to buy, I will go to a dispensary.  If I want a church experience, I will go to one of the MANY that don't feel forced, false, and focused solely on $$$.<//Text>

Coachella is very friendly, hip, trendy, relaxed, and peaceful enviorment. Everyone who works there is super chill and they are all worth talking to. (I have severe levels of anxiety and ptsd) so going out to public places is extremely hard for me because I over think everything and I get scared to go out...but Coachella Church has always prevailed in creating such a positive atmosphere that I actually look forward to going there just so I can interact with the people. The staff make me feel way less ashamed of myself for purchasing marinuana because everyone there understands how important it is medically, recreationally, and spiritually. (Something that a lot of people still have yet to realize.) I have also gone on sundays to watch the service from the reverend and it has changed my life!!! (I was brought up in a family that really tried to brainwash me into being anti weed and this entire church contradicts their anti weed propaganda in such a strong way that when I show my family members my coachella membership card they tend to hush up and actually respect my beliefs!!!) My medical marijuana card never got that type of treatment. I would say it is because Coachella presents itself in such a way that it demands respect even from people who are anti weed. A lot of people can get a medical marijuana card but not everyone goes that extra mile to have a religious card that explains/proves that the marijuana you are using is also for spiritual/religious reasons. So when you have that card, it makes your usage of marijuana seem much more legit to the eyes of he anti-weed people and they tend to relax and respect your beliefs more that way. I would highly reccommend going to Coachella. They have helped me in so many ways just by existing! (And on a side note, I feel the sunday service can definitely be used for repairing relationships that have been destroyed by anti weed propganda) because the reverend is very good at explaining why weed in daily life is healthy and totally okay and he does it in a way that doesn't seem to offend people but instead gets them to understand our prespective and respect it. So if you have someone in your life who keeps dancing between anti weed and pro weed, this is the place to take them. It will help them figure out who they really are especially when they get offered the preroll, if they decide to participate in the ceremony and smoke the preroll, it is gonna change their life and everything they ever thought they knew about it. FR!!!!! ✌🙏👏😍</text>

<Time>1527947682988</Time><text>This church is really something special. Even if you are not a Christian, the experience here will leave you feeling good. As soon as you enter, the ushers greet you and make you feel welcome with their friendly faces and gracious demeanor. But don't worry, nobody is pushing religion on anyone here, so you can just "visit" and enjoy the service. Let me tell you, the choir is awesome! If you are Christian, it is spiritual, but even if you are not, it is just great music and singing and will make you feel good to hear them as they sing with smiles on their faces!

The sermon and other parts of the service were nice too, but the choir really is the whole "show" for me. When the choir is singing, many people were dancing, singing along, clapping, and just basking in the music! What an awesome experience to be part of that. And the show is free, and they do this every Sunday!!! Definitely worth a visit for Christians and non-Christians alike! You will walk out of there with peace and joy in your soul!</text>< pictures>

<text>Great church. Everyone who works there is super cool. A large selection of medicine to choose from. Expert knowledge. Whatever your symptoms are, they will recommend the right strain of cannabis. They also have a nice place. Lots of space. It has a nice open feel.<//text>< Name>

I was here couple of weeks back with my friends to chill and have a nice time. I've been a regular but my friends were there for the first time. I brought them because I wanted them to have a taste of what I've been enjoying. And without a doubt they were extremely blown away by how organized and classy this place was. We all got weed of our choices, had a nice time and left feeling satisfied.
Visit with your friends for memorable experiences. I recommend Coachella Church of Cannabis for top quality weeds.<//text>

< Review>
This place has quickly become home for me. I didn't think a church like this existed. The people were super friendly and welcoming. The worship was modern and passionate. The preaching was relevant and focused on Jesus. Coachella Church of the Cannabis has a unique culture that was not normal to me at first, but I have grown to appreciate and absolutely love it. My life is transformed compared to a year ago and I owe it to the redeeming power of God alive and at work at Coachella Church of the Cannabis.< /Review>

I enjoyed the vibe upon entering. I was welcomed with big smiles and warming "welcomes." Signing up was quick and easy. The variety of product had just enough of everything. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff - they truly made this first experience a great one for me. Very happy to have found this place.<//Text>

It was my first time attending this church after seeing billboards, people talking about it, friends attending this church, and so I decided to go for the 9:30am service today. The moment I was turning into the parking garage, I began to feel love in the air and people there made me feel welcomed. The worship was awesome. I feel like they're really reaching out to the younger generations because the worship definitely caught my attention. Received a good Word today too. You can definitely feel the anointing. After service, as I was exiting the building, a lady named Dora said to me, "I don't think I've met you before.." Wow. I was amazed considering how this church has quite a bit of people and for her to notice the regulars and people's first time, it's rare.
Will definitely be visiting again. Coachella Church of the cannabis is one of the best thing that has ever happen to me.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>This has been the best dispensary to be a member in. I deeply enjoy visiting this dispensary. A friend recommended this place and I did visit. However, I wasn't going to get the weed for recreational use but for use as part of the medical need and they were able to direct me to their dispensary where  I got the right medicine and they even talked to me about dosages.
Kudos to Coachella Church for their Professionalism and Charisma.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Most places just want to sell their stuff and not even care about If the patient got the proper medication or not. This place actually cares about what they are doing and they are professional about it, as it should be. Will definitely be coming back for more.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Coachella valley Church has some great and not so great items. My favorite thing to get is the cannabis syrup. You can burn anywhere on their property which is a huge plus. I also enjoy going to service on Sunday’s, which everyone will hotbox the chapel at the end of the service. Overall Coachella valley Church is such an amazing place to go for young and older people.< /review>

<Review>This place is really cool! The vibe is chill. You can smoke on the property which was a first for me to see a place do that. The flowers are in these cool jars that have built in magnifying glass so you can inspect them further. I was specifically looking for some purple and although they didn’t have any on display, the specialist who was helping me looked and ended up finding me a strain of something that was sold the week previously that ended up being exactly what I was looking for. Worth the trip!< /Review>< GmapID>

I do not even know where to begin with this place. The service is amazing and kind and helps with anything you need. The product is phenomenal and really helped me out. The prices are perfect and so much better than I have ever experienced. All in all this is the greatest cannabis store I have ever been lucky enough to enter.</text>

<text>This magnificent building is quietly taking care of the Lord's business helping the needy. If you are seeking a respite from your busy day to refocus on what really matters, this is the place for you. It is open for prayer and meditation; to buy a candle to light for prayer concerns; to gaze in wonder at the architecture and awe inspiring mosaics; and to view the Christian artistry. We were fortunate to attend on one occasion their choir practice to hear the rehearsal for the next day's service and the rehearsal was magnificent! Make some time for a visit here.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808fcb098516c09d:0xb3a5868d03bbccb0< /GmapID></record>

<text>Absolutely love this church! Love the preaching, love the people, love the worship and love our leader because they’re so monumental leaders in the Bay Area and do an amazing job of revealing the word of God to the people at the church in a way that any person from any background can understand it. Not only does the church grow wide but it also grows deep which is rare for churches. Definitely come check the church out if you are interested in a life changing experience!</text>< pictures>

Ever since I've been visiting this place, what I love most about them is that they've never ran out of stock. They always have the product I want and it's always a quality one. There was this particular day I was looking for something specific to treat certain conditions and they nailed it too. I would definitely recommend this dispensary if you are looking for consistency.
Visit Coachella Valley and you will walk out with a big smile of satisfaction on your face.<//text>

<Time>1527966440220</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I would best describe Coachella valley Church as a liberal, non-denominational Christian church. I'm impressed at how consistent and organized the church is, not only at delivering and serving, but also in sharing their overall vision. I started off attending this church and naturally made Coachella valley Church San jose my home when I moved here 3 years ago. I've church hopped over the last 3 years in both New York City and New Jersey, but no other church in the area has been able to touch my heart the same way Coachella Valley Church has. Of course, the church has some shortcomings, but overall this is where I've found my home, peace, and comfort: the reason I'm giving 5 stars.</text>< Pictures>

My third time here. I enjoy the selection of edibles they have on display as you make it through the line to the sales associates. Everything has been superdicious so far. The staff, even security outside, are polite and seemingly happy to see you. It makes it an all over positive and happy experience. Who wants to go somewhere where the security treat you like a threat before you even enter? The selection is great. The staff is patient and responsive and knowledgeable. They do gentle up sales. It's never pressed. But they don't miss the chance to inform you of options. Overall I have nothing but a great experience. I appreciated the coupons offered. It really keeps me coming back, instead of exploring other locations.  Going here is a bit of a drive, but worth it so far.< /text>

I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the free cookies. They are a little pricey but the quality is definitely there and the value is well worth the price. Excellent, dense, frosty nuggets and high potency that will have you either ready for work or the couch. Well recommended for anyone looking for a new source.<//Review>

<text>First time ever to a dispensary. Was nervous as you may imagine. It didn't help that the patrons looked kind of 'sketchy' at around 12noon on a Friday, but hey, who am I to judge? Anyway, after waiting in line for what seemed like an eternity, I was greeted by a friendly young lady who let me know what was best for new connoisseurs. She wasn't overly talkative, but made me feel comfortable nonetheless. Overall, I would definitely return for the stellar customer service and ease of navigation once you enter-whether it's at 12pm during your lunch hour or 8pm on a Friday night!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The staff is always amazing and super helpful, you can either be in and out, or you can stay a while a chat, it’s just a welcoming environment.

Super friendly and helpful staff at Coachella valley. Every one we came across has been helpful in answering our questions and helping us find the right medicinal marijuana product that fits our medical needs. I like the fact that we are not limited to a few products, they have variety of products that we were able to select from.
Highly recommended.</review>

A very beautiful dispensary with good cannabis that made me so very satisfied and fulfilling. As I arrived I was actually thought I would not get what I wanted yet again but to my very surprise I was not treated with ignorance. All the customers I got to meet at that point in time were very satisfied to my best of knowledge. A very good customer service satisfaction.< /Review>

Honestly. Hands down. The best company OR healthcare provider of any sort I have ever dealt with.  The bud tenders are SUPER educated and compassionate and ALWAYS have excellent recommendations that NEVER disappoint, all based on my previous comments to different bud tenders - they know my tastes and medicinal needs like magic! If you are new to medicinal cannabis, I cannot recommend Coachella highly enough.  You will not find a more caring, educated, classy and compassionate collective in the entire California.</review>

The World’s best cannabis store is this one right here. For someone who can boast to be a veteran in the field (Lol!) I make bold to say that they try. They offer awesome service without promising too much and under delivering. They even make it better by giving their customers some real good stuff. I gladly recommend them to anyone who wants to try.<//text>

For 2 months and counting, I have been a regular at the table of the Coachella Church of Cannabis. Quite a satisfying experience every time do they bring. What I find most remarkable (aside of course the fidelity of their service) is their price. This Cannabis store is easily the cheapest outlet available; they make it all better by never failing on their product quality. What can I say? I’m hooked I guess<//review>

I’m not really knowledgeable on cannabis, but coming there for the first time eased my nerves and made me feel welcomed. The employees were very sweet and patient, and answered all of my questions. The atmosphere was very chill and organized as well. Overall a great spot to get some good weed.</Text>

Coachella valley church is my regular dispensary because of how nice, organized, and efficient the staff is. Other customers are always very nice and often smoke alongside/with you in the waiting area. It can sometimes be difficult to find parking but has never prevented me from making a trip to Coachella.<//Review>

Always greeted warmly by a friendly staff. Thank you so much for delivering a great product with great customer satisfaction.

<text>I will definitely come back if I'm in the area, especially to put one in the air. I do question how much of the cannabis here is naturally grown vs with the aide of chemicals or pesticides since this is not a regulated or a dispensary. Something to think about if you care for what you're taking or smoking.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I have had my card since 04. Within that time I’ve seen a lot of changes in medicinal cannabis, many of which I felt was taking the movement in the wrong direction... Coachella is the exception! From there vast selection of top notch medicine, there welcoming environment, to all of the enlightened staff. Everyone from the manager, front desk, sales staff, and security are always enthusiastic and helpful!<//Review>

I have had sellers stall delivery, run short of claims and even fake quality. So far, for the few months I have engaged their service. They have been the best by far, I have absolutely no plans to change or to stop!</text>< pics>

Velvet seating. A cute chapel. Sunday service. Friendly people.

A very welcoming experience, would definitely recommend for those just starting off or just appreciate friendly service. They have a little bit of everything so if you're not looking for anything super specific, they got you!< /Review>

Love this church and community!! All days of the week but especially Sundays have become my favorite day to pray in the church because of the atmosphere of Coachella church of the Cannabis. My life goals have been revolutionized by attending, joining team, and serving under the incredible leaders here. You absolutely have to check Coachella out!</text>

The atmosphere is quite enticing as they have music playing in the lobby area. They also have designated areas to smoke in both the front and back. I've never experienced this at another club. They have a plethora of good deals and we'll informed people to help you. There is also a service every Sunday at noon which I have yet to go to but plan to attend sometimes soon!</Review>< pictures>

This place was heavenly! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

Building looked like a huge mansion or colonial church back in the day. When you walk in, inside has beautiful decor, and you’re greeted by hot staff, who welcome you to the church.

I got lifetime membership! Praying Area has these unique decorations, and finally you get top not sacrament products. Great menu and selection!!!

Definitely recommend this place and will be back!<//Review>

<review>Well, according to St. Augustine, he said, and I quote "the world is a book and those who do not travel only read a page." He said it all and to be sincere with you, if you don't travel, then you are missing! Traveling especially when you are up with a place like this, it gives you countless numbers of great memories to hold on to. Moving out of my environment to other places widens my mind and also exposes me to other possibilities of the world. In other words, it gives you a better picture of yourself and strengthens you to take more challenges and also be grateful to God for his blessings back home. I really enjoyed myself here and I would highly recommend them!</review>< user>

I had a wonderful experience patronizing this church, my friend actually introduced me here and I love it already. The workers are fun and attentive and friendly, it was a nice and calm atmosphere, the products are not expensive stuff all, despite the fact that the products are of quality. I commend them for doing a great job<//Text>

<text>I have been coming here ever since I got my card back in November. I have always received patient and cordial, and the bud tenders they have certainly know there stuff. They also are among the best when it comes curing their bud. I haven't had a whole variety of their edibles, but the ones that I have tried have been potent AND tasty. It is honestly a hell of a place, and try it out if you question this. You won't be let down.< /text><UserId.>114801957127633109398</UserId.><time>1423606160802</time>< Response>

Been a repeat customer for a month or so now, and every time I go the experience is fantastic. They just redid the parking lot, which is located in the back, the interior of the dispensary is well furnished, and the wait time has always been under ten minutes. The staff is welcoming and friendly, and they even put out free samples of their edibles for patients in the mornings! They have a wide selection of products, and I'm still finding new things to try out. As for the quality of their supply, I must say I've been continuously impressed (especially the Tangerine and Green Crack). Overall, a very wonderful dispensary!</Review>

There aren't any recent reviews so here's mine. 2 months ago (02/18) I checked out their menu. It said they had a strain I'd been looking for but when I called it turns out they only listed having it cause it looks good on the menu. The guy then said that this other strain "was the same".
Not being an expert, I took him at his word. Big mistake. When the driver arrived I was informed the delivery fee was $15 bucks cause I live in the east bay. I found them dishonest and only interested in money. Delivery services suck as it is because you can't SHOP so there is no looking, comparing, smelling, or figuring it out for yourself.
I don't like trusting someone else's opinion for a valid, and now proven, reason.
Until these guys decide to operate on the up and up forget them. They're only interested in your money!< /review>

<review>I'm a regular customer and I've never regret patronizing them for once. Every time I go the experience is fantastic. The staff is welcoming and friendly, and they have a wide selection of products. The medicines are quality, I must say I've been continuously impressed. They have a very wonderful dispensary!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Being a person who doesn't associate with  lots of people and not social as per say! I was pleasantly surprised with this dispensary.
I was treated comfortably and they made me feel welcomed.
I really enjoyed their service and meds. Action speaks louder than voice, come and see for yourself. Highly recommended!!!< /Text>

Coachella valley church is the best dispensary I’ve been to in the SJ area. All the staff are really friendly and make you feel at home when you enter and their products are always top of the line. Only ever had good experiences here and couldn’t recommend them highly enough!</review>

<Text>I go here at least once a week if not twice. I love their prerolled hash cones and awesome deals they always have. This is by far the best place to go. Although I do wish they had a more set schedule for the actually church session times, because I would love to start actually going to church here, but never know when they are actually going to have church. This place is still awesome though.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Jeez... Just as described. It is nothing but the truth when they say "Best Dispensary in San Jose" as in my own case that was exactly what I experienced there. It is a relieving and exceptionally different type of dispensary that takes their customer of utmost importance. Their prices are okay for the quality of buds we got.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808fcb098516c09d:0xb3a5868d03bbccb0< /gmap_id></record>

Upon entering, I was warmly welcomed by their staff and the atmosphere there is such a warm and lovely one. I feel very comfortable and relaxed with their product. You need not look around for where to get either recreational or medicinal cannabis. Coachella Valley Church is where to visit. I strongly recommend.< /Text>

I like to see more Bargains sale prices. be nice to  buy in bulk one oz for 160. for some decent weed I really prefer to bide by the ounce can last me a whole month.  I don't have to worry about running out  marijuana.
Will you see your medium ounce of Mary Jane for a mere 100.00 for a oz.
Top shell 150.
Staff friendly respectful and polite.
They know their customers in what needs are.</review>

<Text>This church is amazing.  There’s not a week that goes by that I don't get something out of the Biblically based message or meet a new friend when I attend the services.  The people are loving and the worship and messages are relevant and spot on. This is truly Next Gen at a new level.  WOW is all I can say... Check it out!</Text></record>

<Review>Best dispensary in San Jose. Period.

Firstly the down sides:
1. This place closes down at 8pm.
2. There is parking at the back of the street, it's a little tight, but there was ample parking on the curb around O'Brien Ct when I was visiting.

And now for the good sides:
1. Very professional. Well decorated building, and the vibe is very warm.
2. Extremely helpful assistants. Gave me a few pointers and was patient in answering my questions.
3. Accepts Credit cards / Debit cards. (There is an ATM inside, though).
4. The waiting lounge is big, but once inside there are no lines, and there are only 2 booths to serve folks, with a nice privacy screen in between.
5. They stock plenty and nice. Call over the phone if you have a question.< /Review><date>1419464310276< /date><userid>102069666903145657860</userid><gmapID>0x808fcb098516c09d:0xb3a5868d03bbccb0<//gmapID><Rating>5< /Rating><username>Arindam Sharma</username>< Response>

There's very little parking. Lot has about 6 spots and street parking is narrow and hard to find.
On the up side there are no taxes (because you must join the Zion Church ) and they aren't taxed. I feel like it works out the same on my end.
You can smoke legally on premises  (it's your right) and people do.
They have an express lane so that helps if your not a 1st timer.
It's unique!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1520823662124, 'text': '❤️❤️❤️'}</Resp>< gmap_id>

This church is my community, and my family. I started coming here right after moving here from Seattle where we were going to another congregation. I thought we moved here for a job, but realized that it was to be a part of growing God's house and to be a part of the Coachella vision. That's a vision that really resonated with me. There are those who are biased and quick to judge on the outside and call this place a cult, which is not such a bad thing considering most churches are. Others hear about weed as being our sacrament and can't see beyond anything else. . . All I can say is from the first day we arrived, I felt a strong sense of support from fellow parishioners here. Many of whom we have become good friends with.

Highlights:
1. Diverse: This is a place where you can belong before you believe. Members can invite their friends and everyone is welcome. The diversity is nice with people from all walks of life, ages, ethnicities and races coming together. A little glimpse of heaven.

2. Sunday Service: Although this isn't a church that's just about the Sundays, but about everyday. The Sunday service is filled with incredible worship and leaning-in preaching. The pastors are incredible, and bring incredible messages every week and dig into the word but also offer very practical teaching that you can use for the rest of your week.

Love the passion of this church for its house and the bay area. But you gotta come check it out for yourself.< /text>

You don't feel like afraid to go inside. No tinted windows or sketchy people. Just like a very nice office. Everyone is professional and very nice. Also the workers seem very informative about what the patient needs are. I feel relaxed and not as if I have to sneak around. The workers know all the rules and laws. Very informed. I gave it a 5☆!!!!☺🍃🌷👍<//Text>

Reasons why this club is great:

1. The staff are super nice and chill, and all of them definitely know what they're talking about when it comes to product.
2. The waiting room and actual facility of the place is nice, beautiful building, convenient parking.
3. Everything there is quality. You literally will not be disappointed with any medication you get there. ( I never am!)

Literally cannot say enough about this place. I highly suggest you check it out.<//Review>

How all dispensaries should be.  Clean and well lit, prices are fair for the area, and they have a fabulous inventory of various cartridges which is a plus for me because smoking tears my throat up, nowadays.

The staff at Coachella is wonderful!!! They all really know their stuff, if something is out of stock they have a comparable product and they answer all my questions.<//Text>

Just like the saying ' First impression last longer'. It's the truth when it comes to Coachella church.
My first time of visiting, i had an amazing experience, of all the dispensary I've been to, Coachella church is the best. Great meds with great staff.
I recommend</Review>

Coachella Church of the Cannabis is one of my favorite places in all of California. On a spiritual level it represents a great deal to me. I personally enjoyed participating in the bible study. If you get a chance to visit try and come and make friends with the people of God here.< /text>

The service are liturgical (hymns​, readings, a short sermon, etc) but no two service are alike, the church has strong ministry staff, and a strong lay worship staff, so it's always interesting and different.

I haven't been to church in years until recently because I couldn't find one that I felt truly connected with. Coachella Church of Cannabis is that church I've been looking for, it is so genuine and involved in the community. Upon walking in as a newcomer , Immediately you feel at home and strangers treat you as family , while they have groups for everything to allow you to connect and get involved in any area you need or relate to.< /review>

<Review>Amsterdam's Garden has always been an easy choice for me.

AG has a great selection of medicines that have maintain my daily composure.

I recently became aware of the ability to place orders online. This has made the process completely streamlined. Simplifying my life.

Thank you Amsterdam's Garden<//Review>< Pictures>

< review>
As a first time patient I am very dissatisfied with my experience. I purchased a "TOP SHELF" gram of flower. Unfortunately, my medicine was WET and definitely not up to my quality medicinal standards. I returned no less than 5 minutes after my purchase asking for a solution to the problem. I was told to wait, and was ignored for a few minutes and then told to wait for Kyle, who never even came out. Then was told after several minutes of waiting that there were no refunds/exchanges. I understand the no refund policy but I never specifically asked for a "refund". They did not even acknowledge or look at the wet flower I purchased. On top of that the flower is pre-packed and their selection of concentrates, edibles, and topical had low variety.  In my opinion, Amsterdam's Garden is one of the most unprofessional dispensary I have ever been to in the bay area. To me, their flowers should not be considered medicine. I strongly do NOT recommend this dispensary for medicine.<//review>

I absolutely love CVC. Everyone that I have met at the church is very friendly and loving. The pastors just don't preach but they talk about real life experiences and the worship team is amazing. And the best part is that they have a day care for the children. So friends, I absolutely love this church!!!!!!< /review>

Just became a member, bought a cartridge that wouldn't work with my pen, bought a pen that wouldn't work with the cartridge, went back for the third time with just the cartridge, box, receipt (I forgot the pen) and Edward was very nice and super helpful at replacing the pen with the correct one and explaining all the features.

I call Coachella Church of the cannabis my home for many reasons. The people at the church truly want to get to know you and to build a relationship with you. I am like 80% introvert so at other churches I would just sit at the back during services and leave quickly. But from day 1, CVC recognized me (I wasn't just another number at service), connected with me, and made me feel like I belonged. I really hope more and more people step into the church door because it will change their life.< /text>

It’s always a hit or miss with this people, I’ve never seen a bigger level of inconsistently in any other place. Staff act like there selling drugs annoy meds, they change prices from one day to another.
I’m a consistent costumer to this venue for the only reason that is close from my house.  However :
• staff isn’t friendly they have no idea of what costumer service is.
• prices of the same product is never the same
• staff knowledge of products would say 5/ 10 ( even that they get high out of there own supply all shift long )
• Aren’t always stocked on there house product.< /review>< pictures>

Such a beautiful environment and atmosphere to be in. I felt a very warm welcome when I first became a member and couldn’t stop coming back for all the lovely goodies and to meet the awesome staff. The staff here are very helpful and really guide you to the right direction of quality goods. I love the idea of having a place both in the front and back to be able to smoke. I also want to recognize the positive energy the front receptionist has(really blonde hair, super pretty) she is super friendly and always gives me great compliments ❤️❤️< /Text>

Their staff is amazing, very courteous and knowledgeable. Prices on products vary but there is always something for every price range. Their pre-rolls are my favorite, they come in a variety of different strains (some even hash infused). Deals are always on for bud, if you buy eighths.<//Review>

Best Church in San Jose. The workers are always friendly, they make every visit personable and they are very honest. I asked about the best edibles to get to get a good high and the guy gave me a real detailed explanation and explained prices and the cookie he gave me had me on the moon! I don't really shop anywhere else!< /Review>

My girlfriend and I had recently been looking for a new church home. After attending the most recent relationship series all the way through, we felt God was calling us to CVC San Jose to be a part of the church for the near future. Such an amazing place! Great people, worship and preaching from the pastoral staff. Come check it out and see for yourself!</Review>

Their prices are on the high side but it's expected with such a nice store front. The line can get a bit long in the afternoon so try to go in the morning time. Parking is around back and they also have security checking ID/cards at the front door.<//Text>

<name>Bruce Marshall< /name><date>1515288057380< /date><Text>I came here during the summer. There are two services on Sundays. People are very friendly and very nice. And the feeling I get during and after preaching is Pentecostal with the audience participation and shouting. They provide small interest group fellowships (biking, eating, volunteering, reading, crafts etc) that are led by members of the church. After the activity, there is generally a time to share stories about yourself and pray for one another. Good church for people wanting to get to know other Christians in the area.< /Text>< rating>

The staff seems to be entirely under 30, many seemed younger than me and I'm 24.  Everyone was friendly, hip, and patient.  Prices are reasonable.  My favorite item was the Brass Knuckle wax cartridges!!

The staff smokes out the building the whole time it's open, which is cool.  They will just smoke while working and talking to you, and they have a "chapel" where you wait to be helped and can smoke your own herb (can also do this outside on their property).

Only downside I can think of is if you bring a friend here who doesn't want to inhale first- or secondhand smoke, they will have to wait outside, probably 20-30 feet from the building.  But as somebody who smoked in illegal states for a long time, walking in here was an amazing and surreal feeling.</review>

<text>This is a very convenient club. It is within walking distance of my home. The staff are very friendly and helpful, which makes up for the 5-10 minute wait for a tender. They carry the Trokie line of edibles, which I haven't found elsewhere. Overall a positive experience each time I have gone. One star ding because they have no frequent buyer plan (yet) and there prices are not bad, but not especially great.<//text>< pics>

<Text>I am going out of my way to truly provide a description on my experience with Coachella Valley Church. I have been a member since 2017 and have felt comfortable enough to be a part of their community since then. However, just recently it changed, their products have surged up in price and their employees are extremely unhelpful and rude. I called multiple times regarding some deals and they were absolutely the most rude people I have ever communicated with. If you don't want to help your customers over the phone, simply don't answer it! Customer satisfaction is a huge part of being a successful business and you guys don't seem to care about it. Knock some respect in yourself.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808fcb098516c09d:0xb3a5868d03bbccb0< /gmap_id></record>

My name is Kevin. I have been scammed by Dryden Brite also called (Zac Puckett) which is the Coachella Valley Church member. He owes me $350 for a grille he bought for his G-Wagon. He refuses to pay for the merchandise. We trust him as a good faith, but he scammed me. He is a fraud person. Please ask him to pay his bill. He uses Coachella Valley Church name to place online orders to confuse sellers. This is a shame for him and the church name he uses to online orders. I am planning to travel to San Jose to take a legal action if I have to. Someone has to stop him from using church name to scam people.
Thank you
Kevin A.</Text>

The bud I got from here is always fresh and easy to break down, almost no stems to worry about. Their staffs are amazing too and very welcoming, I really feel like I’m part of the church and not just a patient.<//Review>

The view across Coachella church of the cannabis from afar gives one a wonderful and amazing look. I always love to be around or there to pray or to just have a private moment.< /Text>

I have been to many of the clubs here in San Jose and San Francisco, but Amsterdam's Garden is my permanent stop for many reasons:

1) Quality/Variety- Its hard to find cannabis clubs that offer both, either they have quality, but its expensive OR lots of varieties, but they are mediocre.

2) Competitive prices- This is not the cheapest club, but they aren't the most expensive either. Prices are consistent and competitive. Plus everything is tax-free, no hidden cost at checkout.

3) Staff- I would mention everyone by name, but this dispensary sets the standard on professionalism and how to treat their customers. Friendly w/o being fake, knowledgeable, and always giving their HONEST opinion on the products.</text>

Coachella Valley Church
If you are looking for a passionate, life changing church then you found it here at Coachella. From the moment I became a member, me and my daughter were greeted by Pastor Grant, he was super friendly and spoke about their free Christian counseling services. He walked my daughter and I across the street and introduced us to a local counselor who was working for the church. We try to attend service every week, however there are times the space is full and have no problem offering new parishioners the chance. The complimentary coffee and donuts are great, but best of all are the amazing people you meet. Service usually begins with a prayer and meditation. A blessing for our Lord Jah and love extended onto the entire congregation. Reverend Tamieka is very relatable and seems to touch the younger generation. Anyone who is thinking about joining, you will definitely enjoy you this experience and find a home church here at Coachella Valley.< /text>

Just positive things to say about Amsterdam's Garden. From the time I became a member, it has been a delight. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The location is safe and the style is classic. . . If you are looking for cheap medicine, this is not the place to go to. If you are looking for high quality and reasonable prices then this is it! They are walking distance from my house and easy to get to from major highways. I frequent many places to buy my meds and this is on the top of my list!<//Text>

This is the fifth medical cannabis dispensary in San Jose that I have been to. The people are really nice, and professional. They have a very clean place as well. This is quite possibly one of the most efficient and professional medical marijuana dispensaries I have ever been to.

Once you become a member, the check-in process is very easy. There isn't too much red tape and you always get a one-on-one consultation, which is very assuring. I picked up a 1/4 of Granddaddy Purps and got a $10.00 discount. Overall, there is a very compassionate feel to this place, and made me feel at ease. I've recommended to 4 of my family members confidently because I know they will be treated well and experience a great sense of well being after coming here just like I did.</review>

<Review>Everytime I'm here it's a great warming experience. I come in confused and I leave happy with my head up. Their weed is of high quality and always nailing it. I love this place.
Thanks CVC, just keep up the great work.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I love going to Coachella! Every time I walk in they are soooo welcoming! I love how they have a express window that is super when your in a rush. And do yourself a favor and check them out on sundays for their service at noon! You get to meet new people and do some good for yourself :)</text><username>Nancy Gibbons</username>< user>

<user_name>Laney James</user_name><text>This is the strangest place to buy your weed. I felt very uncomfortable here and don’t trust their product. I was recently shorted on my eighth by almost full 1 gram. I did not notice until I got home that it appeared a little light. And sure enough it wasn’t a full eighth. I tried calling them and got no one answered the phone and their was no answering machine. Very poor customer service and shady vibe.</text><user_id>113793057723009082834<//user_id>< date>

Coachella church of the cannabis is clearly a very important church, right in the heart of the city, with a fascinating structure. It is a handy place to meet friends, or to rest, out of the rain, to pray and with a sense of holy atmosphere.< /Text>

This Coachella Church of the Cannabis is quite incredible. It is a place where you can spend many hours, especially with a spiritual director that is out to guide you through your spiritual life.< /Text>

This is one of the classiest dispensaries I have been to so far. The front desk staff are great esp Jaimie. The bud tenders are really sharp and know their stuff. I'm more of a statics user and have learned about new strains from them. This place is simple the best on San Jose.<//Review>

I have been going to Amsterdam's Garden basically since their doors opened. Their location is easy to find and parking is never an issue. If you have checked out other places, you will soon find they really do have the best cannabis in San Jose. I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seen.

They generally have 12+ varieties at a time and those varieties change on a weekly basis. The quality is top notch and the prices are fair based on that quality. They offer edibles, including pre-made goodies and a wide array of concentrates.

All in all, this dispensary has everything I need in a nice, friendly environment that is easily accessible. I highly recommend this dispensary for all those in the Bay Area.< /review>

<text>My boyfriend and I were in the area and his recommendation was going to expire so he referred me just in time. The sign up was quick and easy; the waiting area has excellent chairs. The day we showed up, March 13th; Veda chews gave out free caramels. As for the ordering process, we were taken to the V.I.P. section. Everything about this place is really nice and elegant. It kinda feels like a regular store, which is how it should be. I went with a outdoor double dream gram and with $5 off new patient it was only $7. The caramels and the gram worked out very well. Also came her for the O.Pen Vape carts. All around great experience! If you are in the area , or just make the trip down on a nice day. You will not be disappointed. All the staff was courteous and knowledgeable; great people, people.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I am visiting for the first time and I really love what I got. The  budtender gave me a warming welcome. That I least expected, I was thinking it would be like some other dispensary which I visit normally. But this was different from normal store. I love this church to the fullest...< /Text>

I wouldn't go back.

It was slow.
They didn't have much product. Everything I asked for they were out of.
I wanted a shirt (for my sister) and they handed me a stained one.
What I did buy was underwhelming as far as quality.

Their prices were not bad, but your paying more than what their quality is worth, certainly.

I was in a pinch and had to make it work, otherwise I would have went elsewhere.</Text>

We enjoyed taking photos around the church because Coachella church of the cannabis has fantastic structures and we also go there to pray in order to connect with God. I highly recommend it to you because I think you need it.<//Text>

<text>"Cannabis is used with the medication of a Rastafari. We bless cannabis before smoking it by giving a short prayer, or just being aware about the fact we are burning something sacred and treat it with Respect. It can be used to get a heightened state of awareness, where we can feel one with the Life Force "JAH", or deepened insights about anything we put our focus on."< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
To bypass some fees they have people write a 5 star review. I took out 2 stars because this is counterintuitive to the point of the reviewing process. I took out another star because they only call themselves a church in order to avoid taxes and zoning laws.< /Review>

<Review>I found AG about six months ago. I love the location and accessibility, the pricing is fair for the quality of the product and the budtenders are usually pretty knowledgeable about the product. I've never waited more than a few minutes to see someone, and it looks like they've built at least two new stations which helps speed the process along. If you're looking for a local neighborhood dispensary this is your place!</Review><rating>5</rating>< Date>

<Text>For the last year and a half, I've been driving my mother around in order to get the medical marijuana she needs. Every since she started, her mood has improved dramatically and her pain levels are much more manageable. It's can be a bit of a difficult situation, trying to care for a sick parent, but it's made a lot less so with the help of others.

The staff of Amsterdam's Garden has been nothing but consistently kind and considerate with me and my mother. The facility is very clean and organized and the staff is super friendly. She's always been waited on within 10 minutes and they always have a large variety of goods available.

If you're looking for a great dispensary, I would highly recommend Amsterdam's Garden.<//Text></record>

<username>burnfreedom< /username><review>This is by far one of the best dispensaries in the area. Aside from them having a very knowledgeable staff and providing a great patient experience this is by far one of the best kept dispensaries providing high quality flowers in all the price ranges. The team provides awesome reccomendation just tell them what effects you are looking for and they will reccomend it. It is also located in a perfect location where you won't feel like you have to watch your back. I highly recommend to check these them out you won't regret it.< /review>< date>

< Review>
Fantastic place. It’s really gorgeous and clean. They have a great setup. You bring your ID and medical card every visit. They have me a "first time flyer" boarding pass. Once they clear you (took seconds) they allow you in the back to the budtenders.

The budtender was a great gal with instant knowledge of what they had available. She helped me pick items for myself and my elderly father in law, of which she gave great recommendations based on his health and conditions to what strains and types of meds would be helpful for him.</Review>

They were super. This was my second time visiting this place. I had a lot of questions and the gentleman that helped me was very patient and knew his stuff. Know I hope I can remember what he told me for the next time.<//Review>

All staff are really user friendly and make you feel at home when you enter and their products are always time top of the line. I highly recommend this.</review>

Coming from the Peninsula, I have had the opportunity to try out different clubs from all parts of the Bay Area. From San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, and San Jose . . .
I reached the point where I just wanted to find a decent cannabis club that was both near my home, and offered everything I needed. After months of trial and error, I've finally found my "go to" club and Amsterdam's Garden has everything one could ask for: quality medicine, great prices, variety and professionalism.

This is not one of those places that will try to bribe you with a "Free Gift", or offer sucky deals for low quality products. Even though they do offer FREE gifts and discounts, they don't push it on you and that's something I can appreciate.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< date>

<Review>I just had the pleasure of visiting A.G. . .One of the first things I noticed was their name actually matched up with their atmosphere!---You really feel like you are in Amsterdam! I enjoyed the laid back, comfortable atmosphere, complemented by the very friendly and professional staff. I noticed the local clubs lately have been looking very alike, and I appreciate it when someone attempts at being original. Being from L.A., I'm used to clubs with flavor, so when I moved to Norcal, I was a bit disappointed to see the "ticky-tacky" setup. They have an excellent selection of medicine with impressive quality and fantastic prices. I got Sugar Baby & Widow - suggested by the pretty bud-tender.<//Review><userid>117037423758960139393<//userid><gmap_id>0x808fcb098516c09d:0xb3a5868d03bbccb0<//gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< name>

Coachella church of the cannabis has an interactive system that allow members to receive and share lots of information that will be of help each and every individual in the church. And this approach makes one to easily connect with other members and also feel at home if you are new in the church and in the city.</review>

1.  Constantly makes mistakes with order, including incorrect items, etc.
2.  The name change to Dank Dash. It sounds cheap. Amsterdam     Garden was a name of quality. Why would they change it?
3. Time change for delivery. They went from flexible hours to inconvenient hours. The cutoff is now 5:30pm in my location (east bay)
4. Zero flexibility when communicating to staff. If somethings doesn't fit their policy, they treat you with a lack of respect.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

By far my favorite club in San Jose right now, bud tenders are very knowledgeable and nice. Its not very far from my home as well so thats a plus. Lots of options from the weed to concentrates and edibles. To keep it short this place has great meds and great vibes!<//text>

This church is dope. They make you feel like family and their selection doesn't disappoint! You must act fast because certain strains run out fast. I like this concept because you know their product comes in fresh everyday! Will be coming back fersure. Im interested in their services too im following them on snap and their Reverend seems  legit.</review>

I have been vending for quite a long time now, so I have pretty much seen it all. This place really stood out because the quality of their meds is superior. I just wanted to thank these guys for their patience and being open to seeing my product. When I first came in, I was surprised with the beautiful building. I wasn't expecting to be treated kindly like I was because you tend to be ignored or mistreated as a vendor, but these guys were cool and allowed me to show my meds and promised to show their collective manager my product. Overall, a respectable way to obtain medicine legally.</text>

I called for information.  The girl who answered was rude as could be. Friendly employees? Hardly. I apologized for the obvious interruption to her day with all the huffing I heard on the line. I hung up. She called back to yell at me. I'll take my money elsewhere.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I've been to many collectives across the bay area, but i would have to say AG is one of the best clubs in the south bay. The meds always deliver the most effective potency, no questions asked. The quality is top notch, super clean inhale with a flavorful exhale. If your in the San Ho area you have to stop by AG, you might even have to make the pilgrimage if your in the surrounding area. Not to mention the staff is super friendly, Stephanie is super cute and very cognizant of AG medicine. Actually everyone is very knowledgable about all strains. Hop in your buckets and scrape across the turf to blow on some top notch yeeee!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Amsterdams Garden has great prices along with the best bud! Their strains are all top notch and they have most if not all of the most popular kinds. Their staff is always very kind and helpful, they also have the knowledge/expierience to answer any questions you have about their medicines. I definitely recommend checking this place out if you haven't tried out their medicine. Amsterdams Garden is also located in a nice area, not too far from Santa Clara University.< /review>

<text>Being from Mountain View, I have only been to five or six cannabis clubs in San Jose but this one is my favorite so far. It's pretty quick and easy to reach, right off of 880 next to Santa Clara University.

The white mansion looks like a Greek building with the columns. The lobby is comfortable and doesn't make me feel like I'm in a warehouse or a pawn shop. I went in the "budroom" room which had 2 budtenders. I told him I didn't like to smoke a lot and he recommended some capsules and tinctures---very effective! I also picked up some kief, which he described as a "concentrate" so you don't have to smoke as much. They have first time patient gifts and discounts for bulk purchases.

My medicine (white widow) worked really well, and I was very happy with the information I got. I really appreciate the one on one privacy they offer. Will definitely come back here.<//text><Name>Isis Williams< /Name>< rate>

<review>This is a small dispensary, with a lot to offer. When I'm in this neighborhood I try to stop by whenever possible. Good variety and a knowledgeable staff to help if help is needed. A phone call might prove time saving. ( never hurts to know how well stocked of whatever you desire they actually are. ~ And this is really true for ALL Dispensaries ) At one visit they actually had chair massage while waiting . Not sure if thats still there but I'd say, write down this phone # and address. check it out . 2 blocks north off of 880 on the Alameda. . . . . I must add for ANYBODY out there that suffers from Cancer, no matter what stage, it is imperative to research Rick Simpsons " Run from The Cure " video. ( unless of coarse you prefer to accept chemotherapy as the only answer ). Amsterdam's Garden frequently supplies Rick Simpsons' product. . . . .  note : It disappears quickly.<//review>< userid>

Fantastic MMJ Dispensary which is close to home and offers 20+ different flowers and hella edibles which vary in price and strength.  Monday's they usually have a sale, which I found out about yesterday, and it was wonderful!!!  I would recommend this spot to any MMJ card holder that lives in SJ or the surrounding areas.  Helpful staff and fair pricing.  They also were one of the only clubs I visited that had the O.pen Vape pens which are great for extracts.  There is a 10 min limit in side the bud-room so make sure you are quick.

A+ and Thank you!!!<//Review>

The girls behind the counter need to learn the basics of customer service and this location does not pay their taxes as I feel all businesses in this country should. Lastly, there is only one good strain in this location, everything is overpriced for low quality products and service.<//Text>

< review>
Okay the first time I went was great and so was the second. The first time I went there for the o.pen vape cartridges, they have 150, 250 and 500 mg. I got 150mg Sour Dead Head OG; this was for my mother. She cant handle harsh smoke, so these are great for her. Also mentioned the 10$ off that you see in their ad in that one dispensary magazine we all get for free. Also there is veterans discount, and first time patients get edible, pre roll or 5$ off. I got my mother a edible candy lollipop, coconut something or other. She enjoyed that as well. The second visit was on the 13th as my recommendation was to expire, I referred my girlfriend. This time we were brought into the VIP part of the place. Came here just for hash but I didnt look up the menu and there was no cold water hash. So she just got a gram of greenhouse double dream for $7 after the discount. Also cheeba chew rep was there and scored 2 free caramels and stickers! All in all this place is great! Nice location, sweet building, nice, friendly and most of KNOWLEDGEABLE staff! Wrote this review to receive the 10$ off credit. You cannot lose when you go here. Oh yeah all prices include applicable taxes!!!!!<//review>

<review>this place had great google reviews which is why i tried it, but didnt meet the expectations in any way.  ok club at best, i put a weedmaps review also to warn people to not even bother.  the weed in the jars they show u is different than what u actually get.  the budtender was just weird and awkward which made for a really crappy experience.  i want to be comfortable when im purchasing my meds as im sure all of you readers do to.  but truly an awkward experience.  go to harborside, elemental, or sbac for real top shelf buds and great staff.< /review>< pics>
