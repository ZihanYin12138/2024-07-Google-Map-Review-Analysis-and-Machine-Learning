We came from abroad to the west coast for the Bald Eagles summer camp. Our kids spent their last six summers at the camp and convinced us to brave the pandemic, international border crossings, and airport restrictions. We flew across the Atlantic and the entire lower 48 to get here. Our oldest, Ethan, was a coach-in-training, a role he has been waiting for all year. Our daughter, Daphne, went to leadership camp, which she had been wanting to do for years. They made friends and had a chance to lead and run things. There is a strong focus on positive thinking and coach etiquette.

These were well spent two weeks. It was far from cheap for us parents, but it was well worth it. We are already thinking about next year.

<review>This summer we are joining the Bald Eagle Spport Camp for the first time.
It was delicious.

First, every day our son was happy and full of energy. He also explained the new games and activities he had learned at the camp.

Secondly, it was a great opportunity in terms of physical activity. We were a little worried about how to maintain an active lifestyle for our son in the summer, and the Bald Eagle Camp closed that question perfectly.

Finally, we want to thank you for the spirit and warm energy in the camp. Our son was invited every time as a rock star))) And everyone who organized the camp was very, very friendly.

Thanks a lot! We are coming back again next year!

Regards,
Alex< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Bald Eagle has been a joy for our son this past two weeks. It starts with the warm, enthusiastic welcome by the Bald Eagle team each morning and ends with a tired and happy kid each afternoon. Nik loved the variety of outdoor activities, team building and of course the otter pops. We will be coming back next year! Thanks Bald Eagle for the great camp option!</Text>

Bald Eagle summer camp is amazing! At some camps when you drop off your kids the "counselors" are really just there to babysit.  It doesn't seem like they really want to be there.  But at Bald Eagle it is the exact opposite.  I don't know how Bald Eagle finds the best of the best, but they do.  These counselors are energetic, enthusiastic and you get the feeling that they truly want to be there and have fun at camp.  They keep the kids engaged and happy.  We have never had a bad experience.  And when I ask my kids if they want to go back to Bald Eagle there isn't ever any hesitation, the answer is always yes.  I highly recommend this camp!</Review>

<Text>My 12 year old son experienced Bald Eagle Sports Leadership camp at the LG campus this Summer.  This was our first time with Bald Eagle and we were both very happy with our experience.  The coaches and staff are all very welcoming and enthusiastic. They really seem to enjoy what they're doing, which helps to create such a wonderful environment for the kids.  I felt very safe and happy knowing my son was in great hands.  We will definitely consider returning again later this Summer. He comes home in a great mood.  He gets great exercise, positive messages and many chances for encouraging social interaction.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

My son tried in Fremont location for Multi Sports camp last year and he really enjoyed it! So this year both of my kids enrolled in Fremont location again and they love it! Kids can try different sports daily and burn so much energy.  By the way, the fee includes lunch and snack, which is very good deal.</Review>

<text>Love love love Bald Eagle! My son looks forward to summer vacation for practically one reason - Bald Eagle multi-sports summer camp. No exaggeration. The camp leaders are all amazing, the days are well-structured, the locations are convenient and safe, and even better for parents is that lunches are included! My family can't say enough words of praise for Bald Eagle. They are simply amazing.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1563897147253, 'text': 'Dan, wow, what a review!

Bald Eagle rocks!

My 9-year old son joined the basketball camp for 2 weeks and he immediately asked to sign up for more sessions.

Bob, Sarah and the staff are wonderful. They meet the campers at the curb, walk them to the gym, and had fun activities all day long.

The included organic lunch and snacks are great. It's so convenient for parents. We don't have to worry about bringing food and keeping them cool for food safety.

We'll go back again next year for sure and try to sign up for more weeks!</Review>

My child had so much fun at this camp loving all the different activity options and the fun counselors who went the extra mile to ensure there was lots of fun and sportsmanship.  We had to miss last summer much to the disappointment of our camper.  We've tried other sports camps over the years and this is the winner for our camper.< /Text>

First off the coaches are all great. The way they welcome you in the morning is just full of positive energy!  My daughter added a week after her week was over and now she wants to be a coach next year. They really do a good job keeping the children happy and busy.  We highly recommend it!  I also love how flexible they are with dropping/adding/changing dates....<//Text>

< Review>
My child loved bald eagle! She was there for summer camp for four weeks and she wanted to go even on the weekends. The camp coaches are all super nice and enthusiastic and that was her favorite part about camp. They give super yummy snacks that she enjoyed too. During pickup at extended care she didn’t want to leave. They have a great mix of sports to choose from and I loved that they taught her how to be a good sport, follow the sport rules, and how to be a team player. She learned how to dribble, play tennis, wiffle ball, soccer, and more! I wish they had swimming at this campus but she still enjoyed everyday outdoors playing. She loved the cheering and music that greeted her everyday during drop off in the morning which set the fun time for the rest of the day. Alex the director is very friendly and responsive too whenever I had questions! We will definitely be back next year.</Review>

All 3 of my children have told me over and over again that their favorite summer camp is "Bald Eagle Camp"!  The coaches are amazing and always positive and all the sports/activities are designed to include everyone and have everyone succeed.  We will definitely "Go Bald" next summer as well.  Thank you for making my kids smile each and every day and for being the positive influence they need to gain more self-confidence in their everyday life.

The positive vibe and approach at Camp has been the main factor in helping him grow from a shy beginner to a sports lover who wants to keep learning and improving.

Both my kids love this camp (7 and 11) and it's our 2nd year.  They make it very easy for the parents as well.  Really love the fact that lunch is included - Thank You!  I also feel they have the best camp counselors; these teens and college students are very positive and interact with the parents extremely well.  I'm not sure if it's the training at Bald Eagle or if Bald Eagle just chooses their counselors very carefully.  Though I'm sure it's a combination of both.  I appreciate my kids seeing these counselors as their role models and hope that they grow up to be counselors here as well.< /review>

My son loved Bald Eagle Camp this last summer, and sometimes wished he could have stayed longer each day instead of coming home! Each Friday, he invited a friend to come try it out, too. Something unique about the camp was the amount of attention that trained, enthusiastic staff members would give - there was an excellent staff-to-student ratio. Also, my son got to swim and play a range of sports, learning valuable skills, without me needing to enroll him in outside classes or teams. That saved us money and weekend time.< /text>

This is THE best daily and seasonal sports camp for kids in the Mountain View area. The coaches are great (yeah Coach Sarah!), and the activities keep our son wanting to go back for more. He participated in Spring Go Zone camp recently and loved it. He is anxiously waiting to go to Summer camp again. The staff and the program is what makes this such a great deal. It's extremely affordable given the content and services. The staff is genuine, professional, and very kind. Spread the word that Bald Eagle is the place to be during school breaks!<//text>

Sports is just the beginning of what Bald Eagle is all about!
At drop off, several cheering coaches welcome each child in the parking lot & escort him/her into camp. At the end of the day, the kids leave with popsicles and tired smiles.
In between, the coaches model discipline, respect and sportsmanship at its most positive.  Our son "grows" more with every summer experience at Bald. We are looking forward to when he can be part of its Leadership Camp.
If you are looking for a summer camp or off-seasonclinic where your child's individuality will be fostered within a supportive group setting, it is time to GO BALD.<//text>

We loved coaching your son as he came to camp with such a contagious positive attitude! Making sure your kids come home happy and tired is our #1 goal!

My son loved his two weeks at Bald Eagle Sports Camp. He was so excited to go each morning, really enjoyed the variety of activities, and came home exhausted! I would recommend this great camp to any child that loves sports and games.< /Text>

My son has been to the camp for several years. Each time he enjoyed it and wanted to come back. He liked the coaches very much. They were encouraging, positive and not mean. I think that influenced my son to be like them when he grows up to be a teen and  a well-rounded person.
Each morning when I dropped off him, we always got very enthusiastic greetings and  that only cheered up me for a whole day. From the camp, my son not only learned basketball technical skills but also learned what to take to be a good coach and a good man.</text>

< review>
Bob and his team put on an engaging camp staffed by truly caring & enthusiastic young leaders. My children have benefitted from the positive nature and message which Bald Eagle Camps convey. As they've grown they have learned the value of what is within their control; their attitude and their effort!  My eldest participated as a counselor-in-training this past summer and received invaluable mentoring. I recommend Bob and his team to everyone.</review>

He also had fun like any other kid!   He wished he could have gone longer than two weeks but, the camp moved from Mtn View to Los Gatos and driving further was unrealistic in Bay Area traffic.

{'time': 1602884160052, 'text': "Thanks for letting us know and we're sorry that the tomatoes arrived in that condition. As you mentioned, once the fruit leaves the farm, it's a bit out of our control but we stand behind our products. We'll email you now to see what we can do to make this right."}<//Resp>

""Spent 40$ on 2lbs of tomatoes. I'm not complaining about the price, however I think that the tomatoes could of arrived in better condition. There were 6 or 7 tomatoes smashed with fruit flies...I understand that it's not entirely the farm's fault, but the tomatoes could of been packed better and there was mo fragile sticker on the box.""
UPDATE: Within a couple days of posting my review, Frog Hollow Farm emailed me to comfirm a replacement shipment for tomatoes. Unfortunately, they didn't have tomatoes anymore. Frog Farm sent a list of what they had. I chose mangos. They arrived in perfect condition and were the most delicious mangoes! Thank you for taking care of your customers! 😁< /text>

We received a gift of mixed fruit, oranges, apples and avocados. All of the fruit arrived in good condition. However the apples, Arkansas Black, were mealy and tasteless. If that is the nature of Arkansas Blacks, I can’t understand why they would be used for gift packages. Perhaps they are nice apples when picked but these had obviously been in storage awhile.<//Review>

Everything here is a must try. Do yourself a favor, go to a farmers market they are at, and buy one of everything! Everyone who works here is friendly, attractive, and knowledgeable and you will NOT be disappointed. They are worth every penny and there are no juicier peaches in the world. Even Georgians order this farm's peaches on their super intuitive to use site. Their olive oil is also the only oil I will splurge on--the quality and flavor is unmatched. Seriously. Try it if you haven't. and if you have, welcome to the smart people club!< /text>

My sister bit into an apricot and said, this is ridiculous, tastes just like from our apricot tree 30 years ago. Thank you for high quality products and bringing back memories.
Great customer service, when one box of fruit came mostly bruised, we received another shipment the next week. Peaches and nectarines were amazing too. Looking forward for fall surprises.Worth every penny, never a morsel of waste. Keep it up!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<response>None</response><Review>I am a huge fan of apricots, likewise I am smitten with FHF apricot conserves.  An absolute favorite for me.  They are truly sublime.  The fruit is chunky yet spreadable  and not macerated into a pulp like other jams, spreads and preserves.  The sugar content is just right, not overly sweet like many store and even artisan brands can be.  Above all, the flavor is purely apricot all the way.  It really shines through without unnecessary additives and the color is gorgeous.  When you see a jar, it's like eye candy, you want to open it up immediately and taste the yummy goodness inside.  You will be so pleased you did!  We just bought a case and I wish I could say that it will last us a while, but I fear it will be gone far too soon!  If it was socially acceptable, I think members of my family would eat it out of a jar with a spoon.  Enjoy!< /Review>< user_name>

I purchased 5 dozen eggs here because I saw their rating on the cornucopia institute's website. They grade different egg Farmers for the way they handle their chickens throughout their lives and what they feed them or let them eat. the majority of eggs we eat have little nutritional value but these ones are loaded with value according to the cornucopia institute's website. They're not cheap but you are worth it!<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Buyer beware! Had an amazingly bad experience with this service. I purchased a 6 month subscription for my father’s birthday as a gift.  Items began to ship, with the first shipment of fruit came rotten and almost rotten.  I immediately called the company with pictures of the items still in the package.  I asked to cancel and was told absolutely no cancelations.  They did not offer a replacement or any credit.  The only thing I was offered is a delay of the other shipments  to the summer so I can get their “ best” fruit which is what “ they are famous for”.  Over the summer several shipments came each containing some  rotten fruit. I called again and complained with pictures as proof and was offered one extra fruit shipment .  Honestly, a terrible experience and customer service. Will NEVER use or recommend them again.  What a waste of $350.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1538606770930, 'text': "Hi Yana,\nWe're sorry your experience with the fruit club was so poor!

<Name>Asher Moses</Name><time>1541235756621< /time><Rate>1</Rate><text>This business engages in bate and switch and other deceptive practices - buyers beware.

Around Halloween they offers a 10% discount on all their products- I loaded my cart and was ready to check out with Apple Pay and was surprised to find out that there is no option to add the discount code if you chose to use Apple Pay.

It gets worse, I have about $100 worth of gift cards which I received for my birthday - apparently you can’t use your gift cards either if you chose to check out with Apple Pay. They have no problem selling those gift cards but when it comes to redeeming them, they make it harder to do so.

In other words, they force you to checkout through them, provide them personal information which they will use to market to you and who know what else they will do with your private data.

I contacted them and explained in detail what the issue is and how they can solve it - It’s a simple fix really - they just have to move the options to add discount codes and gift card information, to the cart itself and from there buyers can decide to checkout with Apple Pay, PayPal or the checkout offered by the website (this is common practice in online retail). It WOULD be a quick fix if they wanted to fix it but their inaction proves otherwise.<//text>< Pics>

I ordered peaches earlier in the season, and I was disappointed.  They were not ripe, and after a few days, when I thought they were ripe, they were only soft on the outside.  Inside they were still hard and didn't have the rich peach taste that I expected.  Later on I ordered the Cal Reds and was thrilled to see that they were nicely ripe and very tasty.  They restored my faith in Frog Hollow Farm.<//review>

< Review>
I buy from Frog Hollow all the time and the recipients are usually thrilled with their gifts.  But when I recently ordered for a Father's Day gift, I was very disappointed.  I ordered on the Thursday before Father's Day and paid the $45.00 upcharge for express shipping (1-2 days) to Los Angeles.  The package got to him on the following Tuesday and it wasn't the care package I had ordered.  I ordered the Apricot Springtime package & they sent him plums.  If they would have contacted me, I would have preferred something else. Waste of $105.</Review>

I just got back from pie camp, which is run by Kate McDermott of Art of the Pie.  It was amazing and so much fun.  We use apricots from Frog Hollow for some of the pies and they were beautiful and delicious.  They were packaged so nicely - each one individually wrapped and cushioned so they wouldn't bruise.  The care that went into shipping them was great and the taste was fantastic.  They were a huge hit with all the pie campers.  I will definitely be ordering from FH for fruit that isn't available in my area.  And I'm thinking FH produce will be my new go-to gift for sending to people.  Who wouldn't want to receive a box of their delectable fruit?<//review>

Ordinarily I'd never eat a piece of fruit from California, unless I were in California. But the other day I was at my friend Harry and Barbara Ludlow 's Fairview Farm at Mecox. Harry walked up and handed me an apricot. "Eat this", he commanded. So I did. Spectacular. I bought a bunch of peaches and plums. Thank you for your hard work. I hope to try one in California one day. I can only imagine how good it must be.<//text>

I enjoy this beach area. You have the beach, the marina, Queen Mary,  Aquarium, the Restaurants... tons of things to choose from within two blocks if even that!!! The beach is a little bit in need of a clean.  I had seen a little more trash than I would have liked but it wasn't bad.( I expected it to be cleaner since I had been there during the colder months of the year. )  The overall experiences have been good and entertaining.</Text>

<text>New owner was super friendly and made us feel welcome the moment we walked in!!! Pointed us in the right direction for the games we were looking for, even if that meant going to his competition stores. Prices were SUPER reasonable!!

Great little Shop and dealt with the Owner Lawrence. He and his staff are very customer focused and very welcoming. Everyone is important that I observed. Best most of all. Honesty. If you have vintage video games and systems go see them. I will be back to continue business with VGG.< /Review>

Great store! One thing though, maybe not use super sticky, damn near glued on, stickers for your used games. I know I'd be happier.<//Text>

< Review>
I loved this place, it’s now my favorite video game store. Now, As for the people that think that this place is overpriced and that GameStop is cheaper, it’s actually not. This store sells an N64 for example, at 70.00$ while it is a little pricey, it’s actually a way better deal than GameStop which retails it at 90.00 dollars meaning you’d save 20 dollars!<//Review>

Definitely a spot to check out. All of the games are well organized, and they have a really good selection. The staff is always great, they help me to pick out games I never heard of that I now love, and when I bought my N64 a few years ago the guy hooked it up with 2 free games and not the cheap kind either. Please support this awesome shop!</Review>

<Review>They have lots of games from old to new . New games are most of the time cheaper then big stores and even game stop. The people who own the shop also run it and they have been gamers since childhood themselves. the can order and pre-order just like other places but at lower prices. They also clean and repair (as best they can ) game discs. They also buy your stuff if wanna sell.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

The guy who was there on my first visit was super chill and a huge Zelda fan, which is awesome since that's my favorite game series of all time.  Had a decent selection from various consoles.  Will definitely be back soon.<//text>

<Review>They have a large selection of games for game consoles at fair prices. No PC games.
My main gripe was when we entered the man said hello, but after 15 to 20 minutes, he had not made an effort to ask us if we needed help. My friend picked a game and he didn't even bother to ask us if we were ready to go. I made eye contact with the man, and he lowered his eyes. I had to initiate conversation with this man to get my questions answered, instead of him using his customer service to help a paying customer.

Also there was no music which was mildly umcomfortable.

Updating my review because they gave my friend the wrong disk for the game he purchased, when he went back they gave him another game to go with it as an apology. That was awesome of them.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I hate buying used games online, because I always end up getting something I wasn't expecting (rental stickers, permanent marker on the cartridge). This place has a great selection with a knowledgable staff. Prices are a little more than online, but you will know what you're  getting and you get to work with a great staff.< /Review>

<review>Having been to other used game stores and big bog stores for my gaming needs, I continued my search... Then I ran into Video Game Geeks..
A small, independent gaming store in the heart of Anaheim. I'm glad I found these guys because the place is clean, the staff is knowledgeable (and doesn't consist of neck beard nerds that will only argue or scoff at your purchases).

New games tend to be cheaper than chain stores and used/retro games come at a fair margin less than other stores around the neighborhood. My fave store...
Highly Recommended!</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Staff is very friendly and knowledgable. They have a great selection of retro games and are everything in the store is competitively priced. My son loves this store and we drive from the Yorba Linda area just to go there. Best place to go for retro items and assistance with anything game related.< /review>

Bought a ps3 from these guys, i was told by one of the employees if it gives me any problems within 30 days bring it back and they will fix it. It gave me issues within a couple of weeks. It was scratching my games. I took it to them so they can fix it. Well i went to get it back 2 weeks later. Telling me i have to send it to Sony and refuse to do anything with it. When i got home the console was not put back together correctly, with broken tabs and a bunch of missing screws. What kind of crap is that. To top it off i called Sony about getting it repaired and they want $150 to fix it.<//Text>

<Review>The prices are too high. I have went to gamestop and have NEVER seen n64s at $70! I even checked their pokemon games and I checked gamestop online their Pokemon firered was 20-30 bucks but at VIDEO GAME GEEKS their 50 bucks. Anyone to who is reading this I reccomend ebay, gamestop, or Amazon just not this overpriced place...<//Review><pics>None<//pics></record>

<text>This is the store that was featured on "storage wars" and they estimated an nintedo collection that included a pal version of  stadium events at 3000...it's crap like this that floods the market with bad resellers..so if they are willing to give a bad price on tv imagine what they will do to you in real life.....just stay away.</text>< userid>

Nice Bass if you are in the right place at the right time throwing the right bait at the right speed and the right depth.  Fishing 🎣can be fun.<//Review>

Easy access trails, lovely views across the lake, ample fishing access, and great kayaking. Have also grilled here a few times - there are several grills and tables spaced out near the bait shop. Plenty of Porta Potties and a clean restroom available for all-day visits.<//review>

Beautiful area to come and do some fishing, ride a bike or just hang out with the family and have a picnic. The water is pretty nice and there’s plenty of fantastic scenery.<//text>

< Review>
Had an extremely rude experience here with one of the employees.
Came here to fish with my dog, and one of the wardens or employees said "the dog is fine right now, but don't bring him again, we don't allow that kind"
My dog is properly trained and was sitting down through the whole exchange of words. He further explained the water is the "source of drinking water in the raw stage", yet they allow boats? Not sure what his deal was but I won't be returning here and God forbid you have a Pitbull that behaves well.</Review>

Beautiful views!

We spent most of our time at the park at the end of Wueste Rd. It was filling up and getting crowded as people prepared for parties. It was a Saturday, so we expected that. Because of the parties, all the shade structures were taken, so I recommend bringing your own shade.< /Review>

Great place for boating there. It will be open for several days in a week. You can take your boat there and have fun. Be aware of the toll road (south part of 125 freeway when you drive there.< /Review>

This is a nice little lake. Unfortunately, you cannot water ski, tube, wakeboard or anything like that. But, if you are into fishing, sailing, kayaking, paddle boarding or canoeing, this is the place for you. It is kind of pricey. You don't pay by car, you pay by person. So a family or group and get kind of expensive if you go a lot. This lake is only open Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays. They do have boat rentals.< /Text>

I was raised on this lake.It is the first lake that was stocked with Florida strain Big Mouth Bass And Crappie And bluegill.Also the catfish are nice an big.But it’s a really tough lake to fish because they are not open all the time.So get in where you fit in and go fishing!</review>

FRAUD. Weeks have passed and no sign of my son’s birthday present. Status has said ready to ship for two weeks now. Received a message from some random company today asking me to verify my purchase. I’ve never heard of them. Go kart USA is running a scam. They do not answer he phone or return calls. They only text. Suspicious. What business doesn’t take phone calls? Meanwhile, my son’s birthday has come and gone and he is devastated. Do not do business with this “company”. I wish I would have checked reviews first. I will be doing everything in my power to shut them down.<//text>

Great products and service! I recently ordered a 110cc ATV for my 6-year old, and it arrived quickly with an easy to follow assembly guide. ATV started right up and has been running good so far.<//review>

<resp>None< /resp><text>The worst customer experience I have had in a long time.  I sent an email on August 20, 2020.  I asked them about a part for a specific Go Kart that they still advertise as being sold on their web site.  I did not hear back but waited two weeks given we are in a global pandemic.  I then sent in in a follow up email. No response.  Next step was a phone call on 10/20/2020.  That went nowhere fast.  I figured I would give chat a try.  The virtual assistant kept trying to sell me products and interrupting the actual conversation with a LIVE chat agent.  The agent then says.  Maybe you should Google it.  Well... that's how I ended up on their site.   Its to bad that these guys couldnt get it together.  I needed one part but wanted to see how they provided service before I ordered my son a new Roadrat Kart.  Could have had a $2,500.00 sale by simply providing reasonable levels of customer service.<//text>< Date>

I worked hard to give them my business, they worked hard to get this one star... refused to let me speak to a sales person... i am convinced that only a few people work here and they just list every go cart made.  Not really a business... just a drop shipper.

Anyone that won't spend 5 minutes answering a few questions to sell 2 go carts... well enough said...< /review>< Rating>

<Review>I’d give it no stars if I could. I purchased a trail master go kart and had it assembled 5 days ago. Somethings wrong with the carburetor or gas line and Ive tried to email for assistance 3 times and haven’t heard Back at all. Horrible customer service. I took a chance because a lot of places were sold out and this place was one of the few places that wasn’t and I see why. Terrible service and response time. My 7 year old daughter couldn’t have a party for her birthday so we decided to get this for because she’s been asking and this is what happens. Go kart starts then stalls out after a minute or so of driving it. Hopefully I’m wrong and this company does care about customer service and reaches out to me to help fix this problem.

<resp>None</resp><review>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!! I ordered a part (by part number) that is show in the diagram on GoKarts USA's website. It is clearly depicted what part I'm requesting in my order, because the diagram has a number and a line pointing directly at the part I requested. I received the wrong part, and was initially told that I would receive the correct part (via chat support) I opened a service request/case/ticket with them over a month ago, almost two months now. They keep closing the request, but don't send me any information on the resolution, or what I can do to receive the correct part. I have explicitly asked what I need to do to get the correct part shipped to me, with no response from GoKarts USA.  I've been going back and forth with their chat support and opening  follow-up requests (contacted them at least 8 times already), AND JUST KEEP GETTING THE RUN-AROUND, IT APPEARS THEY HAVE NO INTENTION ON REFUNDING ME AND/OR SHIPPING ME THE CORRECT PART, EVEN IF I EAT THE COST
AND THROW AWAY MORE MONEY WITH THEM (which of course, goes without saying, but I would never buy anything from this company again!!!). Don't know if I can go back and add to my review after I click submit, but I have pictures, emails, and chat transcripts to back-up my claim, If possible, I would give this company 0 stars, or actually  negative (-)10 stars.</review>< pics>

<review>Awful company. Ordered an "in stock" mini bike 3 weeks ago, still isn't here. Customer service is virtually non-existent. You can't call and talk to anyone, only e-mail and if they answer that, you're lucky. I received some parts after 18 days but still waiting on more. Taiwan and China parts, bikes and karts. I was hoping for better and was excited about the purchase but GoKarts USA ruined it.<//review><user_name>Shelly Henshaw</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Stay away from this company. They sell low quality items at a high price. When you try to leave a negative review on the product page on their website, you’re told that the review will be posted after GoKarts USA approves it. Of course the negative review I left never got approved. Nice to know they deceive their customers by only allowing 4 and 5 star reviews to be seen on their website. Wouldn’t be surprised if those are also fake.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I placed an order on July 9th.  They charged my card the full $1200 the next day.  According to their website and customer service recorded phone line, the average delivery time is 5-7 days.  It does state on the homepage of the site that they are experiencing delays due to high demand.  This is completely understandable so I waited 2 weeks (double the normal delivery time) for them to ship my order.  Still nothing.  I tried emailing, texting, live chatting and calling and could not reach a human.  The emails and texts don't receive a response, the live chat is automated, highlights key words from your messages and replies with generic answers that may or may not apply to your questions. The phone number is even more of a joke.  It's also automated and sends you in circles.  I also went on to their site to request a callback 4 days ago.  Still nothing.  I get the production and shipment delays during COVID but an update and a reply is expected.  I can't even cancel my order because their systems are a joke.  Now I have to dispute it on my credit card. I'd say they have the worst customer service but they don't have any service at all.</Text>

<text>07-24-20: We've now had the Trailmaster Mid XRX assembled for a week.  Assembly was pretty self evident for an experienced mechanic or karter, but that is good because printed instructions for actual assembly are practically non-existent.  You can find videos for assembly on YouTube, though.  The first issue, which I consider to be a safety issue, was that the seat belt/harness system would not operate correctly.  One of my grandsons was stuck in the kart for 15 minutes before actually trying to drive it, while I tried to lubricate, and eventually pry the catch mechanism apart inside the belt.  In addition, it is extremely difficult to tighten the belts, thereby resulting in 12 year old boys not bothering to get them tightened correctly.  Finally, after the first 10-15 minutes of running, the engine began to sputter, then died and could not be restarted immediately.  It was as if it had run out of fuel.  So, my grandsons patiently waited about 15 minutes while I checked over the fuel system.  The supplied fuel filter is opaque, so it was very difficult to see if there was any fuel flowing.  After checking things over, we tried to start it again and it fired right up.  The boys rode it for another 10-15 minutes at which time it again began to sputter and died, just as it did the first time.  This time I examined the fuel filter more closely and determined that it had indeed starved itself of fuel.  I contacted Tech Support and two days later received a reply that the carburetor was probably dirty and the jets clogged.  In my over 40 years of being a mechanical engineer, kart racing and 20 years of restoring classic motorcycles, I have never had a dirty carburetor be the reason for an engine running fine for 10 minutes, then sputter and die, only to be fine again 15 minutes later.  Nevertheless, I tore down the carb, but while having it apart inspected the fuel line and petcock on the gas tank.  From my experience, they appeared to be very small, allowing only a trickle of gasoline.  But, I reassembled everything and once again it ran fine for 10 minutes then sputtered and died until we let it rest for 15 minutes whereupon it ran fine again for 10 minutes.  After contacting Tech Support again, two days later I received a reply that stated, "must be a bad jet".  This time I bought a new petcock and a clear fuel filter correctly sized for a 6.5 HP engine, and replaced all the undersized fuel line with 1/4" fuel line.  It's been running fine since and wearing out my grandsons.  No more short, 10 minutes on, 15 minutes off.  I had been planning on buying two more of these for my other grandson's families, but will reconsider another company.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80856e98b108bf29:0xd99148119645fa70< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I ordered a go kart, paid in full, and asked them to hold off shipping for a week.  In the mean time they sold it to someone else (which they admitted) and put it on backorder.  I called the company to discuss.  I was hung up on once, disconnected during transfer another, and now they have blocked every number I try to contact them.  And they still have my money!! Go somewhere else.

Now they are still holding my money and reporting on every review site my reviews are fraudulent, and I am a representative of a competitor. I am a consumer who purchased the go kart for my daughters for Christmas. I am in no way affiliated with competitors. They have done this to my reviews on yelp as well as with the BBB.  I am sure they will do it to all my reviews eventually. I provided an invoice to the BBB. Hopefully that will do the trick.

I can assure you I have placed an actual order. They charged my card and have yet to refund it. I can provide an invoice and order number. I would contact the company directly, but my phone numbers and email addresses have been blocked by the company.<//Review>< Time>

There delivery time. there tracking stated May 18th. But it was in storage at ARf May 5 and sat there with my following written delivery after 11am Monday through Friday  and verbal instruction to contact me. I get a letter May 12 stating Gocarts usa had them ship it back without a voice mail or text or email. before shipping back.. Gocarts charged me $510 to return a shipment that never was delivered. I have a pending Wells Fargo credit card complaint against this company. Not once did a human being ever call to talk to me after submitting physical documentation as evidence for both companies irresponsible actions. Technically they stole my private property and transported with out notice or contact. Which is basically grand theft and federal crossing state boundaries when unit was fully paid for even when partially refunded.. Get this the ARf trucking stated they do not have the ability to text. Seriously how the hell to your drivers ---communicate with drivers by pigeon. Go carts sent an email after return.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

This company is a joke.  Their customer service is non-existent. They also have a ridiculous shipping policy.  I live less than 10 miles from their locations. Won't allow pick up. Wants me to pay a $160+ for shipping. I can order their products elsewhere for cheaper.<//text>

TLDR: I ordered and they assured me I would receive a Fire Engine Red Mini Jeep, they sent out an Army Maroon Mini Jeep. I have emails to back up all the information contained within this review and GoKarts USA refuses to work with me to find a mutually agreeable resolution.

I really didn't want to leave this update, I wanted to work things out with GoKartsUSA but they have not provided any resolution to the matter through any of their support channels. I want to caution all future customers; I wish I had spent more time researching the reputation of this company before placing an order.

Here's the timeline:
7/27/2019 Order placed & model/color on Backorder
1/15/2020 Model/color back in stock
1/31/2020 Shipment received (but wrong model/color) - Email sent to GoKarts USA
2/3/2020 Called GoKarts USA - created support ticket and called GoKartsUSA as directed Nick (company owner?) unwilling to help, Summer unable to help. Email sent to sales representative Mario unable to help.
2/4/2020 Called GoKarts USA - Abe promised ticket update by 12PM on 2/5/2020
2/7/2020 Support ticket updated requesting current status.
Review left 2/12/2020

I want it to be clear, many emails and phone calls were exchanged with GoKartsUSA when I first ordered so that I would know exactly what they were going to send me and I would receive exactly what I wanted. Despite them delivering the wrong item, they are refusing to do right by the promises they made and failed to uphold.<//text>

Do not make the mistake i did. These reviews are accurate. I took a 1.5 hour drive (one way totaling 3 hours!) to personally take these guys my cart. When I got there they didn't even bother to take my cart off the truck for measuring (red flag).

If i could I would give less than one star rating. The sales rep sold me a bunch of nonsense and i took their work on it as they are the "experts".

Our shipment arrived incomplete. I am being charged a restocking fee and shipping for an item I never even received.

The business model here is say nothing useful, get you the wrong item and charge you to return it.

"...Original shipping and handling charges are not refundable and a 20% Restocking charge and/or 6% Cancellation fee..." -Return Rep.

Take your business somewhere else. You will be glad you did.</Review>

<text>This is the worst experience I have ever had dealing with a company.  Anyone considering doing business with this place needs to find an alternative.  You will be sorely disappointed.

I was shipped the wrong part that took about 2 weeks to come in.  Not a huge deal.  I contacted customer service and was told it was a mistake from the supplier and they would have another one out ASAP.   2 weeks go by and no part.  I call and was told I need to ship the old one back on my dime before they could send the correct one out.   I was never told to ship the wrong part back and there was no way I was going to out of my pocket.  A manager finally got me a shipping label.  I went to return it the next day at fedex and was told they canceled the label.  I call back upset and was then told I needed to provide them a vin number so they could confirm my part.  Again something I was never asked for and I was only calling back to get a label.  I finally got a working label and sent it in the mail.   A week goes by and I get a refund for less than half of my total.  I call up livid this time.  I’m now told they need to check with shipping to make sure it’s the right part before they can refund me.  I explain you already refunded me part of it.  Well we need to make sure you sent back the correct part.  I explain it’s the part they sent me and no it’s not the correct part which is why we are having this conversation.  I was told there was a process they had to follow and they couldn’t refund me.  I am now going to have to go through PayPal to get my money back.  Frustrating doesn’t even begin to describe this place.  And with all the one star ratings I should have known better.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1574032524410, 'text': "Hello Dan,  it seems you ordered incorrect parts?\nWe see an order from Susan for some parts.

Do not buy from these guys.  I purchased $2000 worth of product from them recently (while trying to support small business).  They took my money, sent me only small portion of my order and now I can’t get them to respond to email, text, etc to find out the status of the rest of my order.  I’m starting to think this is a scam or these guys shut their doors and left customers in the lurch.<//Review>

It must be me? I live in Florida, I have ordered hundreds of dollars of Merchandise, dozens of orders from Go Carts USA.
I had one order with a missing part, called about it, was met with a very nice person on the phone,  they put the new part in the mail, I received it and was taken care of.
But...I have a good attitude when I approach people and don't expect retailers to solve all of my life problems. Remember...these are toys not child care for a baby, put things in perspective.
For the people that "drove" 3 hours to take their cart there or claim that this is a drug front....Judas priest you might want to look at your own life first and see were the problem is. Ya think?</Text>

<Review>**Stay far away from this company** The money back guarantee is total BS. They dropped shipped a buggy for my son as a Christmas present. My son drove it 3 times. Clutch was shot, electrical system fried, and the headlights burned out in 3 rides.  Called multiple times and the customer service rep says the mechanic saw nothing wrong with the buggy. So the clutch knocking, slipping, and throwing chains is perfectly normal. Headlights, horn, and push button start not working after three drives is normal also. Then it took 2 and a half months to attempt to collect my refund. Many calls with them saying the refund check was sent. Never showed up. Then after telling me on the phone it was being issued they send half of the money. Plus when pressed about why the refund he said was being issued was never sent, the customer service rep hung up on me. Very professional. You will not get a full refund from this company. Stay away.< /Review></record>

Paid almost $2000 for a go kart  - had it professionally assembled.  Within 3 uses it will not turn left, seat belt will not latch, flag few off.  Called customer service - was told I had to submit the problems on-line with pictures before they would assist me.  Did so - been over a week and still can't get someone to help me.  I ordered the TrailMaster Blazer 200R  - very poor quality.  Horrible customer service.<//text>

I ordered a part and received an email saying it had been shipped.  Still haven't gotten it.  Not only that, they won't respond to emails and nobody answers their phone.  You get transferred around in an endless voicemail loop of BS.  Avoid this place at all costs.  We are now going to dispute the charge to our card to get our money back.< /text>

Placed an order and chose paypal which I point out was an option to pay. They said they won't accept paypal. Okay so then why is that an option for payment?? Then we transfer cash from our checking account to theirs and they state that the payment is not acceptable. Send a wire transfer. Seriously?? It is good enough to use to pay our bills, car payments etc but not good enough for you. Okay then....CANCEL our order. They then proceed to have BMS call us to try to strong arm us into purchasing from them. Wrong move. We will NEVER deal with them and in fact have purchased from an honest dealer who.....gasp.....took our money transfer from our bank to theirs. And it was not a wire transfer. Hmmm. Also told us the factory warranty was 90 days. LIARS. According to BMS it is a year!! I hate shady people.<//Text>

Has anyone considered going in together to take this company to court? They sold a gokart to me that in the photos had pictures of the model with reverse and a vague discription of the Kart. To make things worse my daughter had a small accident and the seat belts locked. She was freaking out and it took 7.5 minutes to get her out (Yes exact time I have it on my security cameras only way to get her out was to get my tools and take the seat belt mounts out) This company sells misleading and dangerous products.< /text>

<Text>Possibly the worst experience I've ever had with a retailer.  I had several issues with my order, stemming from parts that were never shipped, to items in the kit that did not work without purchasing additional parts myself to complete the project.  You get locked into their Terms of Service agreement when you purchase so Good Luck getting something fixed if you dare have an issue after 21-days.  If you're building a kit they will ship you items that do not all work together.  You will then deal with inconceivable arrogance and likely will not get your issue resolved.<//Text>< Pictures>

Buyer beware I just bought a drift trike for my daughter this last Friday. Not even 1 our later i had my daughter riding it only to have the left rear wheel fall off. I had my wife pick me up in the truck took it home and noticed that the opposite side bolts for the wheel to the axle where also loose. I started checking the rest of the trike and found the seat whick requires four bolts only had three. I called and spoke with Miles to express my frustration and Niles replied what do you want me to do about it?" Never did he show any remorse or offer anything to correct my situation. I have decided to fix the problem my self by having to purcahse all new bolts and having to retap and thread both axles and purchase another bolt for the seat. This company is ran by three young men in the office that have no customer service what so ever. When i showed up no one ever greeted me they just sent me to the back to find some guy back there to show me the trike. Horrible business<//Text>

Buyer Beware! I would have rated these guys at zero if it let me. They have incorrect information on their site and expect you to pay for it when returning items that won't work based upon the information they provided. I even got customer service to admit that they wanted me to pay for their mistake because I agreed to their return policy!

Don't Buy from this company!!</review>

Please read this as it is not just a review but a review outlining how Go Karts USA handles customers.

My initial order was a spontanious one and I was quite excited, unfortunatly what I was excited about turned out to be a mistake on the website. I was quickly informed that my order was improperly priced on the website and I would not be able to complete the purchase for that amount. Well, once I was informed my next step was to read reviews to see what I was dealing with, quickly I realized there are some bad reviews out there and I responded to ALEX that I would like my money refunded and I did not want to complete the order. This was after hours so I dreaded the thought of the time it would take to get the refund posted but within about 15 min, AFTER BUSINESS HOURS, Alex responed and refunded my charge, then went ahead and offered a compromise to make up for the mistake, Alex also appoogized. Well if this was truely how they work then I said HELL YEAH, lets make the order and I accepted the offer and within about a week and a half I was cruising aroung in my cool go kart. And this thing is pretty damn awesome.

Now to take one step back, while the Kart was being assembled we noticed a part that was damaged, all I had to do was fill out a help ticket and wait 24hrs to be informed a new part was being sent out.

If you want a go Kart for a good price and a company that cares, then Go Karts USA is the company for you.</review>

Worst customer service ever. #1 Tech support has no idea what they are talking about, sent them a picture and they tried to tell me the part was on backwards when it clearly was not. Not to mention you don't even get to talk to a live person you have to send them an email. #2 one of the items that I bought (intake manifold) wasn't even close to lining up with the bore of the carb (part was incorrectly made) yet they still charged me a re-stocking fee and the customer service rep began getting mad at me on the phone. Not a surprise they have so many one star reviews. Go look on their website all the reviews are 5 star I have no idea how......wait yes I do I tried to post a 1 star review on their website and what a surprise the never posted it. Just google gokartsusa reviews and you can see the real truth about this company. I would like nothing more than to see this business go under.</review>

A decent variety of hair and skin products. Some cosmetics, blow dryers and flat irons. Hair extensions/half wig/full wig options are limited; however, lots of braiding hair. Hair pricing can be high for certain options. 3 stars because everytime I run in at the last minute for a product I'm able to achieve my desired look.<//text>

The Owners are really nice but they just don't have a lot of the Newer wigs like some of the stores in the city areas such as bay area and Sac. So therefore the prices are much higher<//review>

It was so great to find a black owned beauty supply that had exactly what I was looking for, prices were great, service was good. It was also great to be able to shop freely without being followed around the store, even though I had to travel to get here, I will definately be back.</review>

This is the least expensive smoke shop on the peninsula. Butane tall can, one dollar. Pieces start at 3 bucks. As I walked through the store I got a little upset to see that I have been payed nv double at the minimum. It's worth the drive for such bargains.  The employee was super friendly, thanks !< /text>

This fast food place is so bad that I had to do another review on my other account Taco Bell used to be a good about 20 years ago I believe what my mom says but this location is very bad even when it first opened up it was better when it was a pancake house definitely don't recommend coming here for lunch time or anytime had no sour cream on my tacos charge me a dollar no onions on the burrito supreme and no cheese on top of tacos.
Taco Bell has got really sad in the past few years well if you expect its best food</text>

This Taco Bell is number one.. has a very great food it does have an option to order at one of their kiosks with the giant tablet.  And happy hours from 2:00 to 5:00 I just realized so if you want your Frosty for cheap make it in by those times five stars 🌟</review>

Care with the food assembly was okay, but service was low-grade rude.

The person who took my drive thru order was friendly, but the young gentleman who took my money and handed me my order treated me dismissively. Turning one's back on a customer to lean on the window sill isn't cool, especially when the employee doesn't really greet the customer, or even thank the customer once the customer's money is taken.

Yes, I get that young people can be this way -- I was that way when I was a teenager working at a fast food place...but...the management where I worked cared enough to make sure that I fixed how I treated customers, and made sure they were treated well.

The young gentleman's poor treatment of me is a management failure, which means I will need to patronize other Taco Bell locations.< /text>

Ew! Taco Hell!
Not a good location over priced..............
Food is always cold and order is always wrong I asked for extra onion on my buritto not a single onion on it. For the past two years Taco Bell has been disappointing taking things off their menu used to be good in the early 2000s and now it's not good at all they even had the nerve to get rid of the Mexican pizza better off making it yourself we're going to A REAL Taqueria</review>

Tried the new burrito with the grilled cheese on top. I liked it.

Also i set up the app in the parking lot before ordering. Once the app was set up ordering was easy. The order was completed quickly and efficiently.<//Review>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>A beef burrito comes with beef,red sauce, onion, and cheese.  Several times I've gotten a burrito with rice ,beef,and maybe cheese. As of 1/14/21 I will go somewhere else now.

I'm sorry to say I did go back tonight and  went inside to order just to be told I had to order off the kiosk and had so muck of a problem. I  had to go through the drive through.  For some 40 years I've gone to Taco Bell and ordered a  BEEF BURRITO  and they all came with beef, red sauce, onions, and cheese.  Tonight it came with very little meat ,more rice than meat, no red sauce , no cheese , but it came with queso sauce.  I didn't taste so well. I  ordered 2 beef burritos, 2 beefy 5 layer burritos, 7 tacos, and  a supreme nacho bell grande and a strawberry freeze. I asked for a handful of  fire sauce  ,Hot sauce, and Mild sauce.  When I receit ved my order I was only given 5 fire hot sauce and after ordering strawberry freeze not 1 but 3 times and still didn't get it. But while waiting for my order. I was looking through the window from the drive through and they were talking orders from the counter.  My wife said never again will we come to the Taco Bell on Hesperian boulevard and Lewelling again.

I thought after my last review thing's would've improved .< /Review>< pictures>

The one thing that urks me the most is each time I have come around after having given them a break, not a thing has changed for the better! They'll proudly display items that they are sold out of/out of, and won't tell you about any of it not being there until you are at the window - where they then go "Sorry we're out of this/that". Why bother. Go to a different spot.</text>< pictures>

Snack! hygiene is utmost. They don't have walk mile t-shirts yet. The walmart across the way is empty of everything but shoes, watches and informal cloths. Anything to eat, drink, hygiene, first aid, camping, electronic almost gone. My view is you got to be joking or all of you for real. What about the infectious disease that are already here? Can't wait to see when the big earthquake comes hopefully i want be here. Panic City🤯🤧🤭🤕😷< /Review>

They were patient and detailed when ordering and got the order correct!!! They were fast with tge orders and pleasant smiles when accepting money and giving our food!!! The food was 'hot and plentiful'!!! The interaction was pleasant and timely, while our order was being prepared!!! There wasn't enough food on each order is the only complaint but it was good!!!</Text>

<review>For taco bell you get what you get, But here the people are oh so friendly and so very polite. Helpful to seniors and also to kids and everyone in between. In most cases you go to an establishment like this and assume people hate there jobs and bad service. No not here easy understanding to messy kids, And everything in between.</review>< Pictures>

Do yourself a favor and spare a headache. Skip this Taco Bell. Service is at a crawl and workers appear clueless. You'll waste your entire lunch hour.<//review>

Located next to a walmart that is always really busy i arrived on a Saturday morning around 10:30am and get my usual potato taco and beefy crispy fritos burrito.  The drive thru line was efficient but a little slow because the car in front of me was ordering a feast and could not decide what to order and would have rather gone inside to order.  Once i got my order in i paid at the pick up window and promptly received my food that was hot with the hottest sauce and plenty of napkins.  Besides being a little out of the way, would visit again.  The taco bell area tends to have plenty of parking and gets very busy at night when using drive thru.<//Text>

Although the food was pretty good, I was in the dive thru for 40 minutes. There isn't one thing on their menu that's worth waiting 40 minutes in a drive-through line for. Especially when you call yourself a fast food establishment.</text>

<Text>Not only was the experience off, but about 1/3 of my order was missing...only thing saving this review is the non questiong help to repkace the items i stated missing other than one.

When i enetered they said oh your missin x, y n z arent you. Although they werent correct they acknowledge the mistake.  Didnt question what i stated was missing and made them.  But to spen al.ost 40 bucka for a family order to have to come back in and spend kore tome (on top of the 20 mjnutes wait in line) is obboxious.  Still some items werent made right but were made proportionately appropriate.

Bad order, great end. Hard experience but at the end of night, full</Text>< user_name>

Worst taco bell in the state. Horrendously slow, one time I was there 2 people walked out after getting sick of waiting, and there was about 15 people waiting for food, I Waited about 25 minutes for my food. Another time I went there and they 'could only take cash and no fried foods were available'.  I think out of the last 6 times i visit, 3 of those times I left due to some kind of problem or grievance. Go to the taco bell on Foothill Blvd in Castro Valley, they're Infinitely more professional.< /Text>

I used to go through the drive-thru 3-4 times a week, and there was one staff member that recognized me and had memorized my orders. That was a really awesome experience having someone know what you want and not having to explain it.< /Review>

To be honest, my experience here was good.... ish. First of all, the price is a little off. It's a little expensive for the quality of food. Second of all, the quick bite was good. It's just a little something to get feel satisfied. I would also like to add that the condition/cleanliness of the place isn't the best. 4 Stars.< /Text>

< Review>
This is a good place for some mexi feeling food. Although far be it to being Mexican,  it's a good place to meet people for a discreet discussion or maybe a few minutes to study and have something in your belly for cheap. Don't get me wrong, the place is clean and the drive through window is always busy so I guess it must be okay. Can't complain about their many specials and deals though.<//Review>

So slow at delivering food. This is fast food not sit down service. I stop at fast food because I’m short on time not because I have days to burn.<//Review>

<text>Long wait at least 10 minutes, so I asked for my money
back and the supposedly "general manager" was very rude.
I asked her for my receipt so I can do the survey and she said I had
to purchase something to get one.  A nice lady gave me her
receipt and the manager told me it didn't matter that the complaint
would go to her.   I have all lthe time in the world to lo locate corporate

The food hit the spot with Baja Blast to wash it all down. Service was what you would expect since they were slammed with customers inside and out, still took under 10 minutes in the drive thru with the line backed up well into the parking lot</text>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Drive-thru service was okay. The person working the drive-thru didn't ask if we wanted any sauce when taking order or when giving us our order do we ended up with no sauce. It was late so the dining room was closed and the line of cars was long so getting sauce as an after-thought was not possible. Now I know that ultimately it is my responsibility to request/order all of the items I'd like with my order, but when a fast food restaurant employee does little things like asking if you need sauce or automatically includes napkins in your order, it sets them apart from the others and ensures that customers lime myself are happy and continue to come back...</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Clean and well kept.  Generally get the orders right.  Service times vary dramatically.  It is in an area that has high traffic and sometimes you need to be aware of the other patrons.  A couple of regulars that come in there are a bit... different.< /Text>

<text>Drive thru was fast and good customer service. Located on the far corner of walmart hesperian blvd parkung lot its so easy to forget its tucked right next to a freeway on ramp wich makes it a bizzy bzzz bzzz bzzz area. However difficult to remember the facility is clean service is great food is good. Definitly recommend and will return soon as I remeber where they at😁.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808f902c98783d0f:0x2484a2f2738d0bf8<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Taco bell is taco bell and  can't expect more.  Throughout the years,  the Krispy tacos have suffered.  The price is so high for a premade taco shell, a spoonful of ground meat, tiny amount of  lettuce and cheese,  and that's it! Como on taco bell,  you can do better than that!< /review>

<text>Food is very good for Taco Bell (take that for what it's worth). The one negative is that it is usually a 15-20 minute ordeal from start to finish to get through the line and receive your order. Being "fast" food, I have to deduct stars because it isn't... fast.</text>< Response>

<text>Nice and clean, I usually just go in the drive thru, but today the line was way too long.  Prices are way too high for the quality of the food.  I used to like taco bell but I rather just go to a real Mexican food restaurant if the price is this high. Can't justify going here anymore after today.<//text><date>1496035712864< /date><Gmap_id>0x808f902c98783d0f:0x2484a2f2738d0bf8< /Gmap_id>< user_name>

It's Taco Bell, you should know what to expect, and they'll give it to you for fairly cheap.< /text>

I pulled into the long drive-thru line but decided to go in after waiting 5 minutes and the line never moved. Ordered fairly quickly but it took 10 minutes to get my food. During that wait only 2 cars were processed at the drive-thru. I did not see anyone that looked like a manager and the few people that I did see working looked younger than 18 so I can't really blame them for slow service. The food definitely wasn't up to Taco Bell standards. I cannot recommend that anyone should go here after my experience and a lot of similar reviews.<//Text>

This location is only 5 mins away from my house. I visit 1-3x a month. The food is what it is to be expected. 90% of the time, it takes 10mins or longer using the drive thru. I don't recommend if you're in a rush. Not to mention, you can always count on people waiting near the drive thru line, begging for handouts. It's rare the employees apologize for the slow service. The reason I gave my last visit 4 stars is because I ordered the chicken taco salad and requested extra lettuce and salsa for a small fee. Best. Taco salad. Ever. I will always order it with extra lettuce and salsa going forward!!<//Review>

<Review>HAHA!!! Why does it say Taco Bell is a 'Mexican' restaurant? This is fast food with 3 ingredients... Ground beef, tortilla, and cheese...they just change the shape of it and call it something different. If you want Mexican food, go to a taqueria.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Updated location with lots of space and parking.   This seems to be some sort of regional interview and TB business location, which at times can be a little irritating as I go here to get away from that at lunchtime.</review>

HorribLe service, took me aLmost 20 minutes to get my food. The employees were rude and at this point, I'm asking myself did these people spit in my food. You shouldn't be acting devious if you're an employee making people's food.</Review>

I got to Taco Bell at 1230am Waited in drive thru line for almost 30 mins finally got to the ordering at 12:50pm and told that they are closed and not going to take my order 😡 but it says they don’t close til 1am so why wouldn’t they take my order....I got to the window asked what time they stop taking orders?the guy said 1am so why wouldn’t they take my order at 1250am he said because once I got to the window to pay and get my food it would have been 1am and they don’t have to give me my food because they close at 1am. So if there is a long line and it’s pass 12am don’t get in line because they won’t take your order past 1245am. Btw this was my second stop at a Taco Bell the same night the 1st one was close at 12:15 but they said they close at 1am.😡😡😡</Text>

I love taco bell. I know it's not the best meat but it's something to have every now and then. The taste is just good. Personally I love the chalupas and the doritos tacos supreme. The flavour and crunchyness of tacked makes the experience great and the best t part comes last. Their Cinnabon delights. Yummy yummy. You must try them if you haven't already. Anyway about this taco bell location.  I went through the drive thru. It took about 12 to 15 minutes until I got my order.
The staff were very friendly and nice and got the order correct. The food was good and they weren't cheap when putting meat.
All in all service was good but drive thru was really slow for a taco bell.<//text>

< review>
I waited for more than 15 minutes fokr my food when another guest started to complain to the manager about her food that was taking longer than mine. One person was SLOWLY cooking food for the drive thru and the lobby. The supervisor said just wait about 5 more minutes. I left without my food! Will never return<//review>

I wish I had Read the Reviews before I came here. I walked into the Taco Bell. NO Customers inside i waited Over 5 minutes before Someone told Someone Else to help me.My number was called and i then had to Wait Again for the Drink I Paid for!. 7 people working in ,Empty Restaurant. Lots of Playing Around behind the scenes here. I cant wait to get back to my Desk and send a Mass Email to all 3000 of my Colleges Not to come Here.and tell them to spread the Word!< /Text>

Worse place never come back, did not get my order right at all then overcharged me (isn't that illegal). After I contact them back trying to figure out if they going to correct the issue, the guy was rude calling me a liar. DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//text>
