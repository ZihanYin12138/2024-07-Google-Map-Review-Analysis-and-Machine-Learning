FYI - be aware that they scan items out for delivery, and never update status.  They will hold on to the items and not return to sender, nor update sender, eventually claiming packages for themselves.  They will say that "every driver has their own policy" which doing the correct thing is seemingly not part of.<//review>

<review>We have had some serious issues with this post office. They do not know how to do their jobs. I get damaged packages regularly, I will include a picture of one of the worst ones. I have been trying to locate a package  picked up on almost 2 weeks ago in Burbank and they just tell me they dont know whats going on with it and to just call this location. I do and I never get to speak to any one. I had to contact the seller to find out more information the the actual postal people don't what to do their jobs.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtKR1EQYMsVWsPxstkCvahLrbpFzYLhZhLZXHn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiX3p5HXZqP0iJYhuN8Bnms2QBL3xcAWTZEJEx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3VwVs0XBikZXYrK2sNvSTY5L6nDFgbL1jnSQx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa7Mgi1Bdcq3T418ZuxylvpulatV8VOjFNXQDP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJ5ZxGPBZeyRWFflATzuqRp-JVTW-m7EPPTdfe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKVPOXGwfsQ8FP5XEO2aLylrgjfsQ67xhwM3IY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH-g3Iw67n7gvcRVpBcCdiEipDbf2TUfsCwRSb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>I just got finished waiting for 20 minutes behind two other customers who showed up unprepared, were told to fill out mailing stickers and then were allowed to go back to the front of the line. All the while, only one USPS employee was working the window and he said another person doesn’t come in until 9:30 am. This poor rating is for your apparent policy of allowing unprepared people to go back to the front of the line and for this office not staffing properly. If I know I’d have to go back to the end of the line, I would come in ready to go and my transaction at the window would be short and sweet. Tell everyone else the same, let them whine and moan, and they will learn their lesson! As an aside, the USPS employee, Gerard, was very nice and apologetic for the long wait.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Never had any issues with this particular post office. Every visit has been smooth and pleasant. Customer service is great. Our delivery post man & woman always delivers with care. Sometimes delivers us our neighbors mail but it’s not a big issue. It was for a very short time when it came to packages but it was understandable due to the start of the pandemic. Overall great post office! ☺️ Thank you for your service! Stay safe!</Review><username>Alcova Travels</username>< resp>

<Review>Today was the best customer service I have ever received in the post office. Such great service that I needed to post a review. Worker Sylvia was very helpful, patient and nice. She went out of her way to advice me and help me when sending and proper packaging my package. Sylvia deserves to be recognize. This is the way all post office customer service workers should be.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

If there was a -1 I would give them that! These may be the laziest humans on the planet.  God forbid the mail carrier get out of their vehicle to actually deliver mail to my front door! Yes it is a fairly long and steep driveway but Fedex and UPS both deliver right to the front door with no issues. All the USPS mail carrier does is write out a slip indicating they could not "access" the front door and were unable to deliver which is complete nonsense.</text>

<text>This place is HORRIBLE. If I could give it zero stars, I would. The people are as horrible as that location. They’re all incredibly rude, they act as if doing their job is a favor to you. Not to mention the call services are just as bad as the isles people there. Wait times are 45 mins + when it’s not busy at all. So sad, what a disgusting excuse for a location and those workers who are clearly just waiting out life sentences.<//text>< userid>

<Review>If this USPS Office is an example of what's happening with the USPS, there going out of business! Rude inconsiderate Postal Workers, will leave you on the phone for 25 minutes. I have requested updates on my package, via text.
I have received the same message for three days, only the times were changed, without any movement to delivery!  I have purchased from the same seller. When they send via FedEx, it's here in two days.
I will suggest to my favorite sellers, please don't send via USPS!
This is not my first Rodeo, with this particular USPS Office.
In chatting with my local carriers, I hear stories of poor Leadership and moral!<//Review></record>

Unfortunatly had to pick up a package here and to begin with if you don't know where it is it's a pain to find. Then i get it and go where I need to which was fairly easy to find. Then I give them the slip to realize the driver was to lazy to write out the whole name let alone the whole first name so the lady almost didn't want to help me because my name didn't match what the driver decided to actually put effort into writing. Then  waited what felt like forever for her to finally come back to the door you have to just stand in front of and stare at. Then to find out they didn't even put the right address on it so now I have to go to another location<//review>

Update. These postal workers dont even attempt to deliver packages. I got a notice in my mail saying failed delivery attempt and to get the package from the post office. Whats funny is it's a baby stroller and my mailbox is as small as a shoe box. So how exactly did the delivery person attempt to deliver? Never came to my door. Also my mail was being held due to my mailbox being too full from junk mail....so it says to pick it up before 6pm. I just went there and the stupid girl says they closed at 5? WTF get your hours right. The notice I got said Monday thru Friday till 6pm. A man behind me also mentioned them closing at 6 not 5 and the lady sighed and said "let me see what I can do" she goes in the back and comes out ready to help us all. SCREW THESE PEOPLE. They don't follow their hours and are lazy!< /Review>

Monday (Dec 10) the line was out into the entry room and stayed that way, even as 2 or 3 clerks continued to work - and the 2 automated clerk stations stayed busy.

The easy solution would be to have more clerks, but with an organization that is loosing billions of dollars, it's hard to hire more personnel.  And since the volume of first-class mail is down (albeit my Christmas cards single-handedly tried to remedy that problem, this year), their procedures suffer under the weight of the Christmas volume.

I'm thankful to have a post office - since folks in some places, some countries, don't have even this.<//Text>

Always the most economical option and just as fast. Only way to ship economically to Alaska Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Can mail an envelope full of papers across country for way less than a buck. Flat rate Priority Mail shipping is the definite best way to go. No matter how heavy. Quick service. Helpful when out of town. Can still send general delivery! At this facility the employees are very efficient.</review>

This is the 7th post office where I've had a mailbox and none of the others even come close to the horrible service that this one consistently turns out. Every month or so, they stop putting my business mail in my box and that causes a disruption. I've also never seen such unpleasant and apathetic postal clerks anywhere else. I've always considered the post office to be my partners in business and defended them to critics. I can no longer stand up for them.< /Review>

<text>I am in the service delivery area for this Post Office. Last month 3 new credit cards never got delivered to my home. So every 10 days when the card didn't arrive I put a stop on it. This occurred 3 times over the course of 35 days. Also last month 2 of my credit card bills did not arrive and  I incurred late charges because of it. I'm not sure if they're delivering my mail to the wrong address or if it's being stolen. It certainly isn't being put into my mailbox because I am home during mail delivery everyday.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Terrible. My package was lost so I went in to the store and they told me they could not find it and come back the next day. This happened four times and tell they told me to call the supervisor. I called and spoke with the supervisor he told me he could not help me but to call another number to ask the delivery guy where my package is. I called that number over 10 times and no one ever answered. So I try to call the usps store number to avoid going back but their system does not let you speak with a human unless you talk to the robot for several minutes. It finally said I would be connected to a real person and then told me the estimated wait time was 50-60 min with no option for them to call me back and hold my place in line. Still have no solution and online it says my tracking number that they gave me is invalid...< /review>

<text>The postal service worker did not even attempt to bring my item to the house, what he/she did was just left a note saying I have to go pick it up. Well my item was a wheel chair because I couldn't walk. Now they expect me to go pick up the item without any attempt of re-delivery because I'm assuming it'll be the same person doing the re-delivery and he/she is just LAZY to bring it to the door.</text>< pictures>

I went to pick up a package that I was not available to sign for at home. I was not aware they stop package pickup at 5pm because I knew they were open until 6pm. While standing in line a lady in front of me asked if she can get her package. The USPS employee told her they stopped at 5pm, but would go back and get it for her. When she came back out with the ladies package, I asked if she could do the same for me. She said no like it was policy. If your going to allow someone in front of me to do it and have me watch, you better offer the same service to me.
Being a male, I could only assume the lady is sexist. Funny how it goes both ways.</text>

Worst post office ever! They were supposed to change my mailbox lock.  They never called me to tell me it was done.  I finally got a hold of somebody at the post office who told me my keys were ready.  I picked up the key but they never told me which mailbox was mine.  They key wont fit in any of the mailboxes.  I called and told them that and they said my mail person would leave a note on the door stating which mailbox was mine.  Needless to say that never happened.  And now I still cant get my mail or get in touch with anyone.  This is extremely frustrating.  This post office is a joke!</text>

Paid 37 dollars for 2 day shipping. This office let my package sit in there facility for 2 days before ever shipping it. I'm on the sixth day and my package still isn't here. Not sure what's going on there, but most of my packages from California have to stop there before getting to the east coast. It's always this post office to cause my packages to be late.< /Text>

These people are lazy, incompetent, rude, impossible to get ahold of.  Oh, and did I mention LIARS?  Yeah, they "claim" they left a delivery notice for something I ordered.  They never even attempted to deliver. I was home all day waiting for a package they claim they couldn't deliver because no one was home.  They also claim they left a notice, they absolutely did not. They also have left packages for me downstairs at my neighbors door.  Too hard to walk up an extra flight of stairs you lazy bastards?  You are worthless liars and I wish I could rate you ZERO stars!  PS -- try to call them....they never answer the phone!!!</Text>

I have had more than one bad experience with this post office.  I travel a lot and need to put my mail on hold frequently.  It is never delivered on the day that I request.  I was gone last week and asked that they hold my mail through Thurs and deliver, bundled to the large side box of my mail box. Today is Tuesday of the next week and my mail is still not here.  I have experienced this twice.  Also, when they do deliver my magazines are ripped or missing totally and the ads are crumbled and just thrown in.  I've gotten other people's mail that don't even live on my street.  I tried to call them today so that I don't have to take off work early to go there and was told that the supervisor, Mike will not be back for 2 hours.  Before I could ask to leave a message she hung up.  By the way the hours listed by google are incorrect.  They close at 6PM not 8PM!  They act as if it is a big intrusion on their time to have to answer the phone.  I say, if they did their jobs properly there would be no calls!!< /review>

God forbid that your package ever show up at this facility. They are untimely, shameless and portray a very poor sense of courtesy. It really does not matter if your package is priority or regular. You wont receive it on time and you will never hear from the facility's customer service because they never answer their phone. I would go to greater lengths to insure that my packages or mail never go through this facility. Use Fedex or UPS, they provide a much better service.</Text>

<date>1411748887312</date><text>Most of the time the staff is UNFRIENDLY. I just recently called to check on the delivery status online which stated Valencia CA all the way through and then at the DELIVERED status, it showed to ACTON CA. WHAT?! Really? how is that possible. I tried calling and the phone rang for literally 2 minutes before someone picked up. And then he couldn't hear me within the first milisecond, so he hung up. Of course, I had to call back and the phone rang again, and again, and again for 2 minutes before he picked up. OBNOXIOUS. After the fact, he helped me and told me that it must have been an entry error only because he saw my package on the correct route number. But still - trying to navigate the automated system and then trying to get in touch with a REAL PERSON was super annoying.<//text></record>

<Text>I wish I could put in some cuss words to review this place. I will never use this post office again. The manager could care less about keeping people waiting while she la de da's around. I had to tear off my return address and asked for a small piece of tape to adhere it back to my package. I was told they don't supply tape and especially not on first class packages. WOW!!! a piece of tape? Really? Our government money hard at work:(<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Worst Postal Service branch with the laziest and most incompetent employees! They won't even tape the label onto your package for you, instead they try to charge you $3.99 for a roll of packing tape! Go to any other USPS in the SCV - this branch is not worth the time, hassle or headaches!</Review>< pictures>

There needs to be a zero rating but looks like I have to give them a one star.  Pathetic office.   The managers are nowhere to be found and incompetent when you do find one to speak with.  There is basically no supervision at this office.  Discourtesy is the norm.<//review>

The manager who runs this office is a complete tool. He is apathetic, unprofessional and completely clueless. My mail has been delivered to three different addresses out of state three separate times in the past seven months. Twice to Nevada and once to Arizona. I just received certified mail dated from Sept of 2017. They told me back in Oct 2017 that it had been “misplaced”. I’d rather beat my head into a concrete wall then do business here< /Review>

A mail carrier didn't want to deliver a package to my door.
he/she drove by my house and left a note in my mailbox
UNABLE TO DELIVER.  I called the PO and they said it would
be delivered the next day, three day ago.  I can't drive or lift
due to recent shoulder replacement.</review>

<Text>TERRIBLE - This operation is the worst. Packages are consistently delivered to the wrong address and then they refuse to take responsibility or rectify the situation. It is impossible to get a return phone call or for anyone to followup on anything. I even spoke with my mailman regarding my package and asked for his supervisors name.  He told me he knew his first name but not his last and asked what did I expect "it's the Post Office".</Text>< Name>

<time>1465068015355</time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>The awful reviews for this post office are well warranted. I had an important document that had the misfortune of going through this facility. I shipped it Priority which is normally 2-3 days. A week went by and no one seemed to know where my shipment was. At that point I should have gone to UPS or Fedex, but I made the stupid mistake of giving the USPS another chance by overnighting another copy of the document ($23) which would "guarantee delivery by 3pm" on the following day... can you guess where this is going? Once again, the tracking shows it's stuck at this facility. If you're lucky, you'll be able to get them on the phone in 1 out of every 10 phone call attempts, but even then, you'll likely be talked down to and/or made a false promise that someone "will look into it and get back to you"... trust me, they won't get back to you. Go with UPS or FedEx, this place is not reliable to say the least.</Text>< pictures>

ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! They consistently place mail in the wrong mailbox and on the wrong street. Even packages. The response to a problem is " There are new delivery people to your area everyday" is totally unacceptable. I wish we could choose how to have our regular mail delivered. I'm paying extra for UPS, FEDEX, etc. WORST EXPERIENCES with this POST OFFICE.</Review>

I called this post office to inquire about a package that that failed to be delivered and last passed through Santa Clarita. Apparently that's handled by the local processing plant, not the post office because the man replied "who do you think you're calling right now? The plant handles that, not us." I apologized and asked for a number for the plant but was told they didn't have one and my local post office would have to call the plant. I thanked him for the information and he hung up without saying another word. 30 seconds on google turned up the number to that plant.</review>

I talked to him 2 weeks ago asking if I could move my mailbox closer to my home, he said he would call me the next day. 2 weeks later after calling a few times a day, I got through once, but was told he wasn't around and to call back the following day. They don't answer the phones there, they just let it ring until you get hung up on. Worst service ever. Guess I'll have to go in to ask if I can move my mailbox.< /review>

<text>This place must be operated by monkeys. I sent two letters a week apart to the same address in San Diego, Ca. Both were sent on a Saturday morning in a priority envelope. I was told it would be there in two days. The first one took 5 days and the second one went to Sacramento, CA. Unbelievable, through the envelope window you can see the address that I put to San Diego Mesa College with address and the thing WENT TO SACRAMENTO!!!!</text>< pictures>

<Review>I called to ask about prices for passports. "Don", who works at the passport department, was incredibly rude. He was very arrogant. I told him I was going out of the country soon so he suggested the express deal and told me a bunch of prices for different things and I could barely understand him. I asked for the total and he said I could "figure it out myself". I told him I was in the middle of something so if he could be so kind to add it together, that would be great so he unwillingly said he would get his calculator and gave me the total. I then asked for his name and said thanks. He then hung up on me, no response, not even an "mhm" or "sure". This was over the phone, by the way. I called back complaining to one of the post office workers who was very kind. I asked if there was a Don who worked at the passport department and he said "no, but there is a Sam." so... moral of the story, never deal with Sam, he should be fired for his horrible attitude, personality, and offensive customer service skills.</Review>< userid>

The people at this location are the most incompetent people I think I have ever dealt with. I had my mail put on hold for a week while we were on vacation.  All of the held mail was supposed to be delivered on Saturday. It was not delivered. I left a note in my mailbox for the mailperson. Still no response. I called this post office and after a few unanswered calls I finally got someone to answer the phone, she told me to call back in 30 minutes and talk to Priscilla Corleto. I called 30 minutes later and actually got to speak with Priscilla Corleto, she took my information and put me on hold while she checked. I was put on hold for 1 hour and 30 minutes which by that time was closing time for this office. I really believe that she had no intentions to look into my problem and figured I would just hang up after a few minutes of holding.
If these people had a job in the real world they wouldn't last a day. I know I would be fired if I was this incompetent at my job.
As a previous poster indicated these jobs are just to much for the people that get hired by the post office and really should be contracted to a private company and do away with the postal service altogether.</text>

<review>Since April 8th, I have made attempts to communicate with the elusive manager Leo. I called daily and when I did get through, versus the endless unanswered call, I was put on hold until it disconnected.  Twice, I spoke with a very nice lady who took my info with promises of leaving a message for the manager to return my call.  To date I still have not recieved a call.  The post office lost my package and states it was delivered but was not.  This is the 5th package that has been lost at this post office.

I got through to the national post office agency and they informed me that the post office ruled it theft. However, each time my packages were lost, many weeks later, my package made it to me via a stranger who it was delivered to on mistake.  At first, I thought it was a level of incompetence on part of the carrier.  I still believe this to play a part.  But now, I see that at the managerial level, the customer service standard and care is soo low, how could the carriers even be held to the expectation of doing a good job?!  I'm extremely disatisfied and I hope that an investigation happens here to weed out the crappy employees that don't care about the quality of thier performance.

I have since disputed the issue with amazon for resolution.  The post office has not responded or helped at all.  I have rerouted all of my deluveries to my work address as I have no faith that the post office will perform at any level higher than stupid.<//review>< Name>

bunch of irresponsible thieves.  I mailed by headphones for repair in error, I was suppose to send it fed ex.   now no one seems to know anything about them.  I spoke with the supervisor at Sylmar, who told me if I am lucky, fedex received my box or maybe its at the santa clarita office.   in the meantime, these thieves have no protocols in place nor do they even care about helping you located a box you gave them in error.</text>

Haven't received my mail in weeks.
Two packages confirmed delivered, been a week on the phone daily trying to talk to someone. Finally got a hold of "Mike" a supervisor or something. I got the usual "I promise I will call you when I figure something out." Notes to the postman shredded and shoved into my box, no birthday cards. Packages marked as delivered left in package box with no key, had live animals delivered, been in the package locker for over a week now because they won't resolve the issue and give me a key to the package locker. They're dead. The post office murders animals, yep. All my christmas packages delivered before december 15th didn't make it until mid january, though they were marked as delivered the 20th.
EDIT:[3/14/14] Still no response back from the post office. A new key was delivered for one package, contents were not in good shape. No other mail has been delivered aside from sales circulars. The postman eye-rolled and pretended I didn't exist when I confronted him, ignored me. Still not received my animals. THANK YOU USPS.<//text>

<Name>Alexander Vineyard<//Name><Review>For the past three weeks I have gotten mail three times. This has never happened to me before and I have no idea what to do. At first I thought it was because my roomate moved out, but then after a while I noticed I didnt get certain bills. I have tried to call them countless times and have gotten a "this person is not accepting calls at this time" message many times, gotten someone picking up the phone and hanging it up many times, and even a person answering and saying "Thank you for calling the Valencia post office, how can I assist you today?" and hanging up right after twice. I finally got fed up with calling and went in to ask what was up with my mail on my lunch break. I stood in line for 40 minutes before I got an email from work about an emergency on my iphone and had to leave.

I am taking off from work early today with hopes that visiting this time will be different, but I go with no expectations. Wish me luck.< /Review><rate>1</rate>< gmap_id>

Mind u this is after having my call ignored over 8 times and before they picked up to "transfer" me they picked up and immediately put me on hold for ten seconds and ended the call.

<text>This is the second time this post office has misplaced my package. First time they insisted someone stole my package off my porch (which is extremely improbable), and this time they do not know where my package is or who is supposed to deliver it. I called and they left me on hold for over an hour, then the receptionist was very rude to me and so was the supervisor with whom i spoke. It eludes me as to how the USPS has not been fully taken over by the private sector.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c28743fc642f53:0xd1f0851ec7a89db6< /gmap_id></record>

Why this location need a phone number, when they NEVER answer?????!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tried different days and times, it just rings and rings and rings.............................
100% agree with the customer, who says that they do not deserve even a one star!!!!

The only reason it even got a star is because it was the lowest rating I could give.The neglect of duty's around this office is HORRIBLE!!!!  I live across the street from the post office and my mail doesn't arrive until 6 PM in the afternoon.Why hasn't the state shut this place down yet...or at least fire the terrible help!!!! They are negligent and irresponsible and could care less about the Recipients Mail!!!👎🏻👎🏽👎🏿</text>

They have a phone number, yet no one answers? Called about 5 times and waited for someone to answer, each time I called I waited 10 minutes and nothing. Too bad I can't give them 0 stars.</review>

Was supposed to receive a certified letter. Asked that it be redelivered on Wednesday. Not delivered as requested. Worst post office. When you call no one picks up the phone.< /text>

Why do you have a phone if nobody ever answers it?  I have questions from my home in NY about my mail in Santa Clarita.  It's not like I can just drop in.  Just answer the damn phone or give me a name of someone who can answer my question if I write and mail it to you.< /Review>

<GmapID>0x80c28743fc642f53:0xd1f0851ec7a89db6<//GmapID><Review>They delivered my plates to my new vehicle to a different address. I did get confirmation that I was to receive the plates, and I got confirmation it was delivered, but it never showed up. I waited 24 hours and still didn’t show up. Since I live in an apartment, I’m pretty sure they put the key to my plates in someone else’s box. I filed a claim to locate the plates, but I’m not sure this will be found. This the third time this has happened and normally a neighbor will send my mail to office to get it to me. I contacted office and no one has contacted them on this delivery and will probably have to inform dmv. My temp tags are to expire soon, too. I’m screwed.<//Review>< user_name>

I absolutely love Duffers! You can always find a familiar face or make new friends. The bartenders are energetic and sweet, they can really pour a stiff cocktail. The cooks are more than willing to customize your food order, & their ingredients are fresh and always so tasty. Live Jazz by the one and only Rob on Thursdays. Fridays they host karaoke that rotates between DJ Henry and DJ Eric. Great crowds, awesome fun and with a view. What are you waiting for??</text>

Duffers is a good place to visit, in the afternoon. They have indoor seating, or you can enjoy outdoor sitting, with a choice of two patios.< /Review>

Love coming here after a round of golf. The food is really good and inexpensive. One heck of a value. Miss your hole in one on the course? Stop here afterwards.... you will feel like a winner.</review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Waitresses are great.  Good food.  Problem is, some old black guy tried to tell me to leave because he thought he could push me around, despite the fact that my cousin, who died two years ago this month of a painful and debilitating cancer, was a well-loved bartender there since around 2001 and not only did I eulogize her (she was like my big sister growing up) but we had her funeral reception there!

That guy had some nerve and apparently he's part of a regular group there during the day.  I don't know his name, but I know an elitist bully when I see one.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Love how Coco does my nails, any design I ask for she always gives her all to make me happy. I’ve been going with her for about 10 years. Recommend going in early, but that’s just my preference. (:<//Text>

<text>Was super happy with the quality of my polish change. Although I can’t remember her name she was personable and friendly I discovered the shop is ran by sisters and it’s a very friendly environment. I was visiting Bakersfield for a quince and my toes got lots of attention. Will definitely return for the quality and value and this shop also does eyelash extensions which looked so amazing but I wasn’t able to get them done before my departure to Vegas any way I’ll be back In town soon and I will be stopping by.< /text></record>

Coco is always professional, timely even when I'm running late, friendly, and gets the job done right. Prices for services are equitable, reasonable and fair. Her work is immaculate , creative, and always spot on. She is an expert to detail.<//text>

I came from out of town for a wedding. My sister nieces and I went to her because of her reviews.   I wanted Gel toe nails, I even showed her a picture what I wanted, she said she could do it. She messed up and tried to put the blame on me. She was like ugh... I have more clients coming in. she messed even in the color and right after that she was rushing her work. She did a terrible job in my nails and with the grinder made a cut in my sister's finger. If could give 0 stars I would. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND COCOS NAILS. NEVER COMIGN TO THIS PLACE.. I RATHER GO TO ASIAN LADIES. The good reviews she has is probably her family reviewing.</review>

I have used Coco’s nails several times for a full set, fill and gel nails. I’ve never left of disappointed! Coco and her employees have a knack for beauty and nail art. I especially love the acrylic 3D flowers they have decorated my nails with. The ladies are always very nice and enjoyable to talk with.  The ladies are always very nice and enjoyable to talk with.  I highly recommend this nail salon.<//text>

Always has what I need. Gold VIP membership here gives you a good chance to win the raffles for the more limited shoe releases. SilverArmyGuy was here*</review>

Just got a pair of Ralph Lauren's. They are so nice. I recieved compliments on them when I went out. I love color and you guys have it. Your my new shoe store of choice.  Your associates were so patient with my indecisiveness, they probably thought that I was a secret shopper. If I was they would of gotten a good mark, Baldwin Hills Mall, keep doing what your doing.< /Text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>Disappointed with their customer service:

They had a really good deal on the smoker that I was looking for, but the unit that I bought from them was malfunctional. The adapter to run the smoker through a wall plug didn't work and when I called them they told me that they couldn't replace the adapter or the unit and that I would have to call Green mountain grills to have them send me any replacement parts. They were closed for the holiday and my wife and I were on a camping trip so if I wanted to use the grill that I just bought on our trip I would have to buy an adapter from Amazon with next day delivery. I called the barbecue HQ back afterwards and ask them if as a courtesy they would allow me to come by and pick up a bag of pellets and they said that since the warranty isn't their proble they couldn't do that.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great bbq shop with a ton of product, grills, wood and pellets. They carry Sharpe's wood from the OC, which is amazing. Thanks to the two guys who treated me well and very informational.<//Text>

Best place for your bbq needs. They have off-set & pellet smokers, charcoal and gas bbq's. Green Mountain Grill, Yoder, Weber,  Meadow Creek, PK Grills, and more. Plus they have a great assortment of Premier Meats. All the accessories for your everyday cook. Go get yourself a Grill or Stick Burner.<//Review>

Great selection of BBQs and ingedients to make it sing. Very helpful staff with great prices to boot. If you can find what you like here, you don't like much or are very very picky.</text>

I was in the market for a quality pellet smoker after having a bad experience with a previous one I got in contact with Eric at BBQ HQ he spent the time with me to go over all the pros and cons of the pellet smokers on the market this guy really knows his stuff I recommend him for all your BBQ needs.< /Text>

The place was extremely busy and they didn't make you feel rushed so they can get to the next person. The price was way more than I normally spend at other places but coming here is worth it. If you want to pamper yourself please do not hesitate, your hands and feet will thankyou. Ask for Christina and Tina.<//Text>< pictures>

Then asked for ombré color nails and the transitions is not even good and she cut me two times. But it would be a good place if you just want a basic color but just keep in mind they will charge for every single detail.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<username>Jamie Stewart<//username><review>Very rude guy there. Because he didn't know how to do the style I asked for he then decided to not want to help even when I asked to do a different color and not to worry about the nail art. It's not my fault he isn't advanced enough to do the style I asked for. I was schedule an appointment to be told no one was there to do the style I wanted. When specifically asked if someone would be there Tuesday and was told yes. Wasted my time. I've been here several times even with my husband and given a higher tip than I should've. I will never recommend this place to anyone to go to.  They are rude. And obviously don't have the skills to do things.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dcb8dec98322c1:0xa55a4f3ee596b29f< /Gmap_id>< Date>

I truly believe this place does great work on your nails. They're patient and I see that they do care for good quality work, this place is happy and full of positive energy. I go to Kevin and he does really good nails.  He takes his time on making sure everything turns out good. He will even ask you if your satisfied with your nails if not he will happily redo the work. There prices just like everywhere else that won't overcharge you.  Been coming here for over 2 years and I will keep on coming back.<//review>

<review>Store is clean and employees are nice. Good experience for shopping. Dropping off donations is another story. When there's a long line people drive around the line and park at the cones to drop off before the others waiting. Also, some people bring a big box of mixed items and separate them into the different bins while others are waiting so it can take a long time of you're behind one of those people. The guard/employee out there allows both when he should be prioritizing in order. He could at least help them unload to keep the line moving faster.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I know the covid situation, even though it's not an issue right now, is still affecting our state, but when they don't allow us to use the dressing rooms, they should also change their policy on returns. Normally I agree with not allowing returns, but right now I don't. We should be given an hr window to return items that don't fit.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Great experience! People are right, this Goodwill is very well organized I was so impressed. The staff members were quick to pick up articles of clothing that were laying on the floor (I felt so bad that they had to do that, customers should pick stuff that they drop up themselves!) and were very visible and easy to reach if I had a question or something. Special shout-out to Ahmed for having wonderful customer service and being so kind! You are awesome, Ahmed! All of the employees were very friendly and wonderful people. 5 stars well deserved. Also, your purchases are going towards a really great cause - helping provide employment for folks who need it most. Really worth the shop.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1607460026378, 'text': 'Thank you for your positive feedback and for supporting our mission of providing job training and employment to people with disabilities and other barriers.

They are so expensive! You might as well go buy brand new from a regular store. Plus they never have anything very good really. Also they don't do discounts on certain color tags, they only have senior, military, and student discounts (10%). Not really worth the stop on a thrift shopping day!</Review>

< Review>
I enjoy Goodwill but not this one. The floor manager is rude and not very helpful even with his staff. He acts arrogant and entitled to treat people like he is above them. Maybe he has been there to long. I do enjoy the rest of the people who work there very pleasant, unfortunately I will not be going back to this particular Goodwill.< /Review>

This goodwill is BIG compared to others in San Diego. I love how spacious and the layout of this place. A little bit more expensive in my opinion.  I purchased a tea cup and saucer here for $5. Other places sold for $3.< /Review>

<review>Very neat and tidy but I couldn't find anything I needed at the prices they charge. 5.99 for random plates and glassware just not for me. Used children's clothes that are faded and show the wear should be 99.-1.99. It's a good cause though for sure.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Went in today with my family. My son asked politely to the worker man in front of the dressing room if there was a bathroom. The worker was frustrated and said “I don’t know maybe in the market next door you can run around over there.” I was with my son watching him making sure he wasn’t running around. He didn’t have to be so rude to a child. Then as my family and I went to the dvd section he gave us a mad glare. I looked straight at him then he turned away when he realized I noticed him glaring. I will NOT be returning to this location. Everyone else seemed rather polite. But I don’t feel like coming to a goodwill with someone glaring at my family and I!<//Text>

Crazy high prices! Some items in housewares were priced higher than new items. Never used to be this way, must have a new mad pricer. Rest of the people very nice but I would avoid this Goodwill until pricing sanity returns. Sorry Goodwill, your high prices are not helping those who need a hand!< /Review>

<review>Saw another's review of this Goodwill about prices being high and they are correct!! Some prices are higher than new prices, haha. Someone in the store has no idea about prices. I had a job where I went to the dump on a regular basis and saw the Goodwill van there dumping a full load of things on a regular basis. If they priced things better, they could move more things and help the landfill situation and the planet. Stepping off the soap box now. I had the same experience when I went in there to get Halloween items. Went with my girls and they went off and started finding clothes for themselves on their own and found some cute, good clothes. The great thing about a second hand store is the variety all in one place. Clothes were, for the most part, priced well. Friendly staff also!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1547521172389, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind review and feedback.  Your ideas will be shared with our management team.

Got a vg+ first edition Dr. Seuss Hardcover here. (How the Grinch Stole Chrismas) for $1.50. I didnt even realise it was first edition till i got home, i just wanted Dr. Seuss in my home because La Jolla is his home city and we just moved here.

Had a great conversation with the cashier about Dr. Seuss. She was sooo nice and so happy... i left there feeling happy myself and i went on to have a really good day. (I was feeling depressed and drained from having to move 2 times in the last couple months). So, I hope they keep it up. You never know how your customer's lives are going and that (even though it seems like a small thing) taking just a small amount of time to brighten someone's day can make a big difference in their life.<//Review>

if you like to help give back, do it at the good will " don't trash it drop it" at the drop off in the back of good will store and help some one get on the job training. Its a great idea and has lots of treasures for pennies on the doller. Good job for the person that thought this would work in the beginning  Must be a free thinker , a giver not a taker . trees gives a man takes we must think like trees to understand our universe.

The staff is great, the service is fast. This place used to be freezing but I think they turned the thermostat up, thank goodness. Clean place and service and quality you expect from Jamba Juice. Only thing missing here is a restroom.</Text>

Used to work for Jamba. Ordered large smoothie with whey protein powder. Instead of giving me the rest of my smoothie in a small cup because whey makes the smoothie expand, she stacked a dirty blender on top of it to be dumped. The other Jamba’s give you the rest of the smoothie too. I payed for that.< /Review>

A worker used the ice scooper to put ice in her personal water bottle. The excess ice fell off of the bottle and back into the ice container being used to make the smoothies.  It was a black large possibly metal drinking container with red roses/flower design on the side near the top. She was the shortest blonde hair young lady. She had on a yellow t-shirt. I have the date and time.  Still shocked, I am sure that this is a regular practice.< /Review><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

When you order a smoothie and pay for add-ons, they still put it in a medium cup. Makes me feel like I am not getting what I am paying for 🥺 if I am paying for add-ons and it would fit better in a large cup... Why not put it there? It was disappointing 😔< /text>

I walked in yesterday, 9/13/19 and the place looked clean, but it smelled overwhelming of something rotting/ maybe even vomit? It was bad enough I walked right back out without ordering. Even though it was Friday and had already been open an hour. The trash can by the door it was even stronger. Whatever is going on their, it's not good. I've been to like 3 other ones and they always smelled cleaned.</Review>

This is my go-to location for morning smoothies & juices since the next closest place (to my office) doesn't open until much later.

I'm a fan of their green ones, and although they aren't as healthy as making them at home, JJ certainly beats the breakfast burrito I'd rather be having...

The only downside is that this location shares the lot with Starbucks so it can get busy during the morning. You may just have to walk a few extra steps, but nothing to cry about. Bonus, you can grab a coffee too, if that's your thing.< /Text>

For years I've ordered the same drink - Orange Dream Machine, light ice and blended twice. Today and probably the last two times, my drink has tasted watery - very slight orange flavor.  I'm going to go to another location from now on.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Macha Green Tea for $6.19 is really good. It costs more than your Ave meal but it's worth it. If you are heart or anxiety sensitive, ask them to put only 1 scoop of Macha Green Tea as you may get heart palpitations and get shaky if you drink the large sized one. But it tastes really good though and 1 scoop is actually enough for a normal kick.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Dr. Sunshine and his staff are absolutely amazing. I was a bit skeptical of the DPC program at first, but because I value the doctor and Sandy so much, I was happy to give it a try. I couldn't be happier that I did. I feel like a VIP, with great access to the doctor anytime I need anything. It's pretty much the exact opposite of what you would expect from a large provider where you'd just be a number to them.

<Text>I would give this doctor SUNSHINE and his STAFF a NEGATIVE stars if i could. This doctor and his staff is the most UNPROFESSIONAL service provider in the business. Not that they only provide unethical service on top of that to make it even more difficult on the patients they BLOCK their medication from refills and without notice CANCEL out the online accounts for review. Also when you reach out to them to get answers they refuse to speak with you. ON top of that be careful of their SHADY practices of charging incorrectly and over for the services they don't provide to get extra money from the patients. DO NOT use this DR for any medical services. Please make sure and check their YELP reviews to see the reality of this office!!!!</Text>< pictures>

He spends time with his patients and makes recommendations for a better quality of life rather than just prescribing medications as with many physicians.  Also the waiting room wait is not excessive as is rather rare these days.  Highly recommended!<//review></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I have been going to OC Sports and Wellness to see Dr. Sunshine for years. From all aspects, it's a great experience. That includes: 1) The technical side of the medical information being communicated to the patient 2) Taking care of the patient by doing great work and 3) The logistics of appointments, bills, insurance, etc. The team at OC Sports and Wellness does an absolutely fabulous job. Cameron is also great at what he does. All of my appointments have been taken in a timely manner (<5 min wait) They have earned my trust and business, and that is why I continue to use them as my primary doctor. I highly recommend OC Sports and Wellness.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Dr. Sunshine is a gift from God. He knows how to listen and fulfill your needs. On top of everything I felt very respected , he suggested a lab test, I refused and he did not push me to do like others. He got me and will have as well my husband and friends that I will refer to him.<//Review>

Dr. Sam is not one to over medicate. He prefers natural methods of treating and preventing issues. I am a fan of that philosophy. On a more personal note, his office is VERY close to my place of employment, so that's a plus as well.</Review>

Very satisfied with the Dr. Mathew consultancy. I have been connected with OC sports for last 10 years and recommend others to consider Dr. Sunshine or Dr. Mathew as their primary physician.</text>

Dr Sunshine seemed great and knowledgeable.  Can’t tell if the procedure worked as orthotics were an important part of the treatment.  Got fitted and paid for the orthotics.  Seven weeks later and numerous calls to the office manager and we find out that the orthotics manufacturer  burned down a month before we were fitted and the manufacturer still was not open.  His staff was not helpful, rude and did not return calls. We have our money back after much hassle!< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Sunshine and his staff, Christy up front and Cameron getting your vitals and drawing blood if needed, are always a great experience, especially when you're not feeling so great. I've had a few primary doctors in my life and I feel more comfortable with, and better counseled by, Dr. Sunshine than any other. I've also had occasion to need physical therapy and they work hand in hand with Dr. Jason Baran DPT. who's suite is literally right next door.  It makes for a seamless treatment of a physical injury and Dr. Baran is absolutely top notch.  He got me through Rotatator Cuff surgery, plus some chronic back pain, and did a fantastic job.  If you want a doctors office that really gives great care, OC Sports And Wellness is your answer.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I went to the Auto Zone in Suisun today looking for battery terminals for my car and a young lady helped me first and she was very nice and polite and helped me all she could, then Chase the store manager came over after helping another customer and helped me find what I needed, he was great, knowledgeable and friendly, after I got what I needed he informed me that if the part I purchased didn't work just return it with my receipt and they would take care of it, fortunately it worked, as I left the store he said thank you and have a great day, great customer service, I definitely would recommend to anyone that is the store to go to for parts ,thanks again Chase ❗💯👍<//text>< pics>

<Review>Paul Wiley helped me greatly!!! Wow he placed my battery in my car right before work.
I pulled up to Auto Zone worried because my car had trouble starting, I know nothing about cars mind you however Paul came out with the biggest smile on his face ready to help me, he also gave me valuable knowledge about my car.

I called to ask about the Fix Finder service which is generally provided for free at most AutoZones. I was informed of this service by my stepfather and decided to give this location a call as it is closest to me and have purchased a few parts here in the past. Scott (employee) answered the phone call and when I asked, informed me they did not do the service themselves, they have a tool "we" the customers use ourselves to figure that out, but in a demeaning sort of way. I was in the middle of asking further questions when he apparently had a customer come up to him while in the middle of the phone call ask him a question and he just hung up.
I've worked in customer service for years in the past and this was unprofessional. This conversation could have gone completely different and will no longer be going to this location.</Text>

This old gentleman always make me feel unwelcome, I'm not mechanic but it's been a few times that they give me the wrong parts and he gives me a face everytime I return the parts, because they didn't fit or were the wrong ones, even though I gave them the right information of my vehicle. It's like an inconvenience to him. Never going back there again. I rather go to a different auto parts place were they help me with attention a friendly  smile and make feel welcome.< /text>

<Text>Our family have been visiting Buca do Beppo for yrs. now. The ambiance and service has always been top-notch. People do need to be aware of menu pricing, the plates do not come for individuals, rather the dishes are served for all members of your party. This can be a sticker shock if not careful.<//Text><userid>104490385757196832047</userid>< Response>

I JUST moved to Morro Bay, and let me tell you, this is the best restaurant in Santa Clarita, in my opinion. There's a theater RIGHT near, a mall, and Chipotle as well! It is so cozy, the staff are so nice and friendly and the food is wonderful!<//text>

<review>First time since covid restrictions, me the wife and kid ate everything! The service super fast ! The portions are huge ! If you are the sharing type of family the price won’t be so bad since their dishes can serve 2-3 people easy. The wife and I don’t agree so we order our own everything and we had the best time love this place !!! Lausagna, fetechini Alfredo, garlic bread , anti pasta salad , lambrosko wine and a huge desert for 150 bucks .....we are still eating left overs !!!!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< gmap_id>

Great! The staff was friendly. I was able to place my order easily, and take it to go fairly quick. I appreciated the young girl assisting me at the counter, she was able to provide dish recommendations when I wasn’t sure on what to order for one person. The food tasted great, and was well worth the price.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>First time eating here since COVID - they were fantastic! Socially distant outdoor seating and meal deals for every day of the week :) we got the Buca Trio Platter (calamari, spicy shrimp, and mozzarella triangles), the Wednesday special, and a colossal brownie for dessert. Everything came out hot and delicious! Our server, Julio, was also very attentive and even kind enough to heat up the brownie for me (it's usually served at room temp so the ice cream doesn't melt all over).

We'll definitely be back soon!<//Text>< Pics>

HORRIBLE. WILL NEVER GIVE THEM OUR BUSINESS AGAIN. We pre-ordered thanksgiving dinner on November 3rd. Got there, waited in line, to then wait in another line to end up being told they ran out of all food and we can sub a chicken dish and a pasta dish for the thanksgiving dinner, but we have to wait for it to be cooked too. They also advised that since they were giving substitutions, that there would be no refund of any difference. Well pasta is a heck of a lot cheaper than what we paid for. Finally, i said i just wanted a full refund and they advised they can't do them and to leave my name and number and someone will get to it next week. Several people demanded to see the manager, Manny, and he refused to come out to the crowd of people. Even the employees were saying they were trying to get him to come out and he wouldn't. Now 5:00 pm on thanksgiving, we drove all over town and finally found a jack's open. So buca thank you for screwing up our holiday and for hiding in back letting your staff take the crowd alone. If you are a manager then maybe own up and take the crowd on. It is what you are paid to do....MANAGE. one excuse we all were given is they didn't buy food for all the orders because people don't always show up. You charged my card 200.00 already, you bet i will show up for the food i was already charged for. You lost me now as a customer for all the other days of the year.</review>

<text>I was supposed to pick up my thanksgiving dinner order at 5 PM today but they canceled it at 4:20 PM. What am I supposed to do now? They could've just inform me earlier so I could change my plans. Or simply don't take so many orders if you can't make it happen.< /text><name>Alexey Li</name></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I placed an online order for Thanksgiving Feast on November 3rd. We scheduled our pick up at 4pm. Upon arriving at 4pm, we had the worse customer service, which we and everyone else was apprised that they ran out of turkey and the side dishes. If we wanted, we could have a chicken and pasta dish....We paid for Turkey, not chicken or pasta, without any refund or price adjustment.

When several people demanded to speak with the manager, we were told, he was in the kitchen. We were later told that he refused to come out and speak with the customers.

The level of incompetence is unbelievable and we will never dine at this location again. Quite frankly, we likely will never patron another Buca Di Bepo. Our concerns have been shared with the corporate office, because an overhaul of management needs to be addressed at this location.< /text>

<text>My order (which was correctly input by the server), came out just plain wrong. Also, my pasta had  a few stray mushrooms and peas. Not a big deal you say? It is when you have a food allergy and order something that doesn’t have that ingredient- only to find that the kitchen simply doesn’t care and slaps together whatever’s in their bowls. Overpriced, deliberately priced and sized portions for 2 people or more. Mediocre food. Subpar service. Go anywhere else.</text><time>1518144975031<//time><userid>118301346907411215842</userid>< response>

Some of the best family style Italian food around. A little pricey but well worth it. More food than you will know what to do with.< /review>

We didn't really like the fact you can only choose a single dish for 3 or 5 people. It is very limiting. Because we could not get small dishes we couldn't order an appetizer or desert because we didn't have 3 people that want the same thing. Maybe it is a good option for big tables but we were 5 and it felt like quite boring meal. The pasta we chose had too much garlic.  The kids pasta were in good size.< /review>

Asked for more marinara sauce for the Stuffed pruscuto chicken because it was so dry...got a good sized bowl of it but it was basically cold. The best part of the meal was the colossal brownie sundae.
Only went because we had a coupon...in fact that's why I went the last time, which was YEARS ago!

<review>I just love Buca. I know, I know, it's a chain, but that doesn't it mean they don't have fantastic Italian food. I love the atmosphere. Seems you notice a different photograph on their walls every time you visit. The family style portions are fun, because I love variety. Have you ever tried their lemon chicken or lasagna? So good, and my favorite is the spicy chicken rigatoni. Really, really good. Plus if you ever get a chance to sit in the Pope Room, you'll notice you can hear the person directly across from you even if it's loud and they're whispering. Haha. Great place to bring the family and/or friends.<//review>< Pics>

This Italian restaurant is traditional to standard fiar.   You will find everything from classic spaghetti and meatballs to true Italian specialties. The service is always great. The server was attentive and on top of their game. We never needed to ask for a refill. The food was excellent. Nothing overdone everything in great portions.</Text>

We went to this place to try it out for the first time today. The service at this place was horrendous!! Our server “Cristine” was too busy making jokes at the bar to properly serve our drinks. The whole time that my boyfriend and I were in there, we felt judged. The service was so bad we asked for our food (which cost $83) to go because, its an uncomfortable environment. The food however, was good but we are never coming back. To the owner please get better servers or you’ll lose a ton of business.<//text>

<review>Unfortunately, this place has zero awareness regarding the community. There are plenty of individuals with dietary restriction be they gluten intolerant, vegetarian, or vegan. I myself am a vegan and at most places I can at least modify items to eat without too much trouble. Heck, to be honest, I can eat at most fast food restaurants! Despite this, Buca di Beppo has been completely unaccommodating in this regard. It's unfortunate that this restaurant, in the heart of the town center, is so completely behind the times. If you want to eat out, regardless of your dietary preference, I highly recommend avoiding this restaurant and instead recommend supporting establishments that care about all of their potential patrons.<//review>< pictures>

This place is just crazy.  Massive portions of traditional Italian. Good service.  Alfredo was a little bland.  If you want to go home with pounds of leftovers and pounds on your waist, this is the place.<//Review>

< Review>
The portions are large but you are paying for it!! The rigatoni with spicy sausage, ricotta cheese and meat sauce was good but once its baked it's a little dry. They brought us extra sauce sauce on the side though with no problem!
The pizza con formaggio with garlic oil was really good!  So bring  a big group and a big wallet and your all set!!<//Review>

<review>Eggplant is still delicious! Calamari is fantastic and it's so huge it could be considered a main course. Corking fee is not too bad so feel free  to bring you favorite bottle to enjoy with dinner.  I didn't order dessert because I was pleasantly full. Charismatic servers and efficient through all courses.  $118 and change for 3 people ( appetizers,  main course, corking fee, and after dinner drinks.  Not bad at all!<//review><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

<review>I really like the restaurant and ambience. Big portions are served. A small dish will feed 3 adults. We had the spicy sausage baked rigatoni. A great dish. The kids had kids cheese pizza. The desserts look really appetizing but we were stuffed to try. Go early it gets crowded.< /review>< Pics>

Went here last night for dinner. Was disappointed in the food. Seems highly overpriced and lacking in flavor. The alfredo was watery and lacked the creaminess you look for in alfredo. The spicy chicken rigatoni had no spice at all. Usually my family prefers Buca for Italian food but lately they seem to miss the mark in terms of flavors.</text>

<date>1533617305781</date><rate>3<//rate><review>It's been quite a long time since I've last been to Buca di Beppo. As of my last trip I have to say that it's pretty average.

To start off with the good, we quickly got seated and our server was very quick to come and get our drink orders. The bread was delivered to the table nearly immediately. When it came to the food the spaghetti and meatballs were absolutely to die for, especially the meatballs oh my goodness I want to go back and just buy meatballs tons of Meatballs.

Unfortunately that's where Pros kind of asked, the service was extremely slow. I don't know what was going on but it took forever for food to finally show up, the pizza showed up a couple of minutes after the appetizer so we really didn't get time to eat our appetizer. The mozzarella cheese sticks bread was lacking flavor, the cheese was good though. The pizza had very little cheese. I was fine with it being greasy and thin crust I love that, but the lack of cheese really took away from its taste. We ordered both the green beans and the broccoli and both were undercooked.

So in the end one out of the 5 things we ordered turned out to be really good. The other four dishes were average. The slow service especially bugged me because it wasn't a busy night. I don't know if they were understaffed or what was going on but it just annoyed the heck out of me and my associates

We opted to not do desert as we were unsure whether or not we were going to have to wait another 30 minutes just to get the desert

From my last visit what needs to improve is the time it takes to serve the food, the quality of the pizza and the cheese sticks as well as making sure that the vegetables are fully cooked. Like seriously it felt like someone held the vegetables over the fire for a couple of seconds and then threw some seasoning on them they did not taste / feel cooked.</review>< pics>

It was enough for a party if 5 to eat! The portion of rigatoni with Italian sausage was HUGE and so was the parmesan cheesy bread. Yummy! We took over half of our food home. It was 3 meals. Definitely a fabulous deal for the price. We're going back again. This will be our go to 'date night' place from here on out. ❤</Review><rating>5< /rating><time>1577981355415</time>< pics>

Buca is always a great place to go with the family. I went for my birthday and enjoyed every bit of it. The server was comedic, each dish portion is huge so count on bringing leftovers, every bite whether it be lasagna, spaghetti, or pizza was delicious, and theirs plenty of delicious options to choose from for dessert! You have to go at least once</text>

Long story short. Made a reservation on Christmas for 9:30 pm, drove over an hour and a half, was turned away saying the kitchen closed at 9. This is after being made to feel stupid, like I was the one who made a mistake. No one even so much as took the time to look at the confirmation number/email. The manager didn't even offer a "sorry" in passing. Just left me there with my dinner party looking like a jerk as we walked out their door.

I'm glad this place is so popular and does so well that they could care less about compassion or basic customer service. I will NEVER eat at any of their locations and I will let my friends and family know about my experience and I bet they will feel the same as I do.

If I could give zero stars, I would. We came in on a weekday after dinner time. The place was rather empty. We were seated and told our server would be with us shortly , but for 25 minutes no one ever came to acknowledge us or take our drink orders. We were very disappointed because it was my son's birthday & such a negative experience. Finally, we decided that this horrible treatment of customers was not tolerable. We got up and left. The hostess that had escorted us to the table glanced at us and smirked when she saw us leave. No questions or apologies. We were so upset that we vowed to never give this place our business ever again. We headed to The Lazy Dog & had an AWESOME experience! So disappointing that they treat customers this way!< /review>

<username>Kassandra DeStefano< /username><Review>HUGE PORTIONS!!! I am a foodie (which means we eat...A LOT) and so is my husband( I'm 5'11" 240lbs and he is 6'5" 250lbs). A SMALL feeds us perfectly with enough left overs for lunch the next day.

I always get the same food: Fetticne Alfredo (sometimes add shrimp), Chicken Parmesan, and Stuffed Shells. Their service is always incredible. The waiter/waitress checks for refills on drinks often and checks on if the meal is to our liking/how we are doing with our meal

SMALLS ranges from $25-$50 depending on the dish but average is $27-$30

LARGE ranges from $35-$60 also depending on the dish with the average being $40-$45

There are pictures on the wall...EVEYWHERE!!! Feels like an authentic Italian restaurant!!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c28740a299009d:0x3130650270e14272<//Gmap_id><date>1560748981033</date><rating>5<//rating></record>

We were a party of 6, 2 of whom were under 11.  Our children were very well behaved; never leaving their seats.  15 minutes after our arrival, a large party (20+) of several small kids and their adults were seated beside us.  The children were EXTREMELY unruly, running around, hitting their birthday balloons, of which were hitting our party’s heads.  One of our guests was in a wheelchair.  The other table’s kids were continuously kicking the wheels of the wheelchair as well as 2 other chair’s legs.  It was extremely disruptive.  As we were trying to enjoy our dessert, I finally leaned forward to one of the parents and said “Excuse me Sir, would you mind reigning in your kids because they are disruptive and kicking our friend’s wheelchair “.  I was met with a belligerent response of “they’re just kids”.  I stood up and told the adult man  that his children were all very disruptive and disrespectful of other people.  The incident escalated into a shouting match, and threatening demeanor from the adult man.  The manager came to the table and was attempting to rectify the situation.  However, the manager chose to support the party with the unruly children rather than our quiet party of 6 with a DISABLED person in a wheelchair who was getting rousted during our entire dinner.  At no time, to our knowledge, did the servers or manager make an effort to quell the large, disruptive party.
As we were leaving, a few of the men from the disruptive group began verbally threatening our friend in the wheelchair.  Again-the manager NEVER reprimanded the disruptive group, rather focusing his attention towards us.
We spent quite a bit of $$$ on dinner and received no type of compensation nor apology.
The bottom line in our opinion is that Buca di beppo in Santa Clarita, vis-a-vis the inept manager, treats those with a physical disability (the wheelchair) as a nuisance rather than addressing the real issue, which was the rude and unruly children from the bigger party.
WARNING: people in wheelchairs or other disabilities might think twice before they choose Buca di Peppo for their dining experience.

P.S. Leisa our server was EXCELLENT and extremely professional.  She was very accommodating.  Bravo!<//Text>

Always a delicious variety of foods to enjoy, no doubt.  Sure, everyone can say their food isn't the best Italian around, but they sure hit the mark pretty close on a consistent basis.
The little things that didn't give them 5 stars for, is merely just based on not have anything I would consider "spectacular" in a while, since discovering them a few yrs back.. BUT U MUST GO for sure folks!?<//Review>

I had the worst experience last night. The waitress left us waiting on several occasions while she was have a conversation. This place is too expensive for that type of service. Our cups of water were never refilled once we sat there thirsty and waiting for service. The bread and butter never made it to our table. And our fried mozzarella was 20 dollars and was horrible. As if it was precooked and reserved. We've been to almost every Buca in California, we eat there twice a month. But this is by far the worst service Ive ever recieved. It was a Tuesday afternoon. We we're literally the only ones there.<//Review>

Our cups of water were never refilled once we sat there thirsty and waiting for service. The bread and butter never made it to our table. And our fried mozzarella was 20 dollars and was horrible. As if it was precooked and reserved. We've been to almost every Buca in California, we eat there twice a month. But this is by far the worst service Ive ever recieved. It was a Tuesday afternoon. We we're literally the only ones there.<//review>

< Review>
I love this place. Food is good and plenty.  But reserving is a hassle for more than 20. Called 800 number given but I was directed by the manager there to use banquet menu when in fact,  it was ok to use regular menu.  Not going to pay 26.65 pp (cheapest set menu) to feed.  That's like a wedding menu! That manager there on 5/24/18 did not seem helpful or friendly to help me.  But Amanda on 800 line was very helpful,  she gets 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!!!<//Review>

<text>I liked the food. Their food servings are big. So I would recommend going with 2 or more people. Like me my cousin and my mom shared one thing of spaghetti and still didn't finish. Granted, we dont eat much. So if you eat alot, I would recommend just going with someone else and share. Their servings are 3 people or 5 people.< /text>< userid>

So overpriced and the food is just not up to par. Had chicken carbonara, the small was $35! Pasta was dry, not much chicken to be found. The brussel sprouts saved dinner however but they too were a little overdone and dry. Service was fine.< /text>

Easy free parking just behind the restaurant.  Cool vibe.  Huge portions.  Yes, the 3 person salad will be enough.  Give the Apple Gorgonzola Salad a try.  Its amazing!!!  Granny Smith apples, spiced walnuts, dried cranberries and Gorgonzola tossed with mixed lettuce in their signature Italian vinaigrette.</Review>

We have eaten many times at Buca di Beppo at many different locations. This visit was super disappointing!! I do want to say that our server was fantastic and was on top of things. We ordered a small Caesar salad, which was delicious and plenty for the 4 of us eating salad. However, we ordered a large penne with meatballs (it was Meatball Monday-50% off) and the meatballs smelled like ALPO (yes the dog food ALPO). We figured we would try the meatballs, but yuck. Not one person in our party of 6 liked the meatballs and the next day everyone was in the bathroom multiple times!! Normally we don’t order this, so I’m not sure how it is supposed to smell or taste. But considering there were 6 people in our group and no one liked it—that should tell you something. We had two containers to take home (we removed all the meatballs and just took penne home, then had to doctor it up by adding our own seasoned ground beef and sauce to make it edible). Then, we had a birthday....very lack luster singing by staff and the colossal brownie was another disappointment. This is a dessert we’ve had and enjoyed many times! The sundae portion of ice cream was fine but the brownies were stale and hard as a rock. Most places give you fresh brownies or they are warm from being microwaved. These were the small bite sized brownies like you buy at grocery store and seemed as if they sat out for days without being covered. They were super stale and hard as a rock (yes I actually took it and was able to hit it on the table and it sounded like a rock). Even the ice cream didn’t help soften it up. What a bummer....definitely a trip that won’t be forgotten. I’m not sure how I feel about returning to this location after that experience.<//text>

I didn't want to go back because of previous poor service and staff gossiping about clients. Well, I was not disappointed. Lack of attention from the wait staff and a general disregard for our table. The food is outstanding, so make this a carryout place.< /Text>

Manager was a little rude. We asked for a highchair when we put our name in. They called our name to be seated, so we go up and the manager proceeds to tell us that he didnt call us. They then sat us in a booth that couldn't accommodate a highchair and gave us attitude when we asked for a highchair. We then were moved to another table. Thank god we were cuz our waiter totally salvaged our experience. He was awesome. I wish i knew his name.<//text>

Service was good but we found a piece of plastic in our entree. They switched it out for us . They need to step up their quality control.<//Text>

<text>if you want good Italian don't go here. I ordered the fettuccine supremo. talk about  dry absolutely no sauce or flavor. My Aunt ordered the regular fettuccine. she was so dissapointed with dry noodles as well. she asked for sauce they charged her $4 for their mistake. my cousin ordered the lasagna blah tasted like they ran across the street to pavilion and slapped it in the oven. Horrible food and way over priced. if you want to be disappointed then by all means go.<//text>< Resp>

Good atmosphere and good food. Food prices seem expensive but the portions are for multiple people. Small is essentially for two people while large is for three or four. If going on the weekend I recommend making a reservation.< /review>

< review>
Today we celebrated birthdays at Buca di Beppo with family.  Thought an early Sunday lunch would beat the crowd and food and service would be better!  Wrong!  The mushrooms were cold,  spaghetti sauce was so watered down and we were told that's the way they make it, and the penne alla vodka dry!  Couldnt get the attention of the waiter much - the place is just as I remembered it.  Poor experience for a $200 lunch and no one seemed to care!  We won't be coming back anytime soon.<//review>

I don't know if the grill serves as a sort of a purgatory for underperforming wait staff but that was certainly the impression we were left with. While the guys at the bar certainly did their best the wait staff was downright poor. When you have to get up yourself after waiting 15 minutes to get your own utensils and water something is not right. For those who may argue they were busy I will note that on that particular occasion there was a staff of 6 serving 10 tables. Stick to the buffet!</Review>

The only good thing about this place is the seating and some really grotesque pictures. Almost Fellini-esque. The food is abundant and mediocre. Their caprese salad puts in evidence the low quality of the mozzarella they use. A place for those who put quantity over quality. ¡Mangia, que te fa bene!</text>

Came here after stumbling upon a coupon on Google Maps for Memorial Day.  My husband and I were looking for something to eat before our showtime for Deadpool 2 and I'm glad we stumbled upon this.  We had the fried mozzarella, it was AWESOME! For dinner we got the Quattro al Forno and we enjoyed everything!  The texture of the filling on the chicken cannelloni was weird but the flavor was good.  The cheese ravioli, cheese manicotti, and the stuffed shells were all pretty amazing.  Definitely recommend for 2+!<//review>

<Review>Two margaritas $34.....ummmmm that hurt. $17 for a drink....are you kidding me? There were No prices on the drink menu of course. No way in hell I would have ordered them if I knew that....and the food was just ok. It took way too long to get the order. Not worth over $120 for a family of 4.. two of them being kids. I will not be going back. So dissapointed. Angry really....uggggggggggggg!!! Dont go!!!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
We came last night.we listed 20 people. We added up 4 more & couldnt even accomodate us. Receptionist was very rude to us. Every time we ask how long more to wait he keeps on increasing the wait time. Poor customer service. And we heard him talking to the white customer & he was accomodating.he's probably a racist. Our waiter didn't offer bread to start. We came in 1St & He took the order on the other table 1st. So we ended up waiting again for our order to come out. Did not even offer my mom a piece of cake for her birthday.  Very poor service.</Review>

I have always had a great meal at "Bucca di Beppo"! While the service has vacillated between very good and inattentive, the food has never disappointed. If you enjoy a celebration of Italy and Italian American culture, the interior decor and atmosphere is wonderful.

Two of my favorite highlights on the menu are the Chicken Marsala (the sauce!), and the Cheese Manicotti, which I consider the best I've ever tasted. The Fried Mozzarella (Antipasti) is also scrumptious!

Overall, you can't go wrong with "Bucca di Beppo". This is one of my favorite restaurants.<//text>

Average. Service has declined over last few years likely due to poor leadership. Don't ask for anything because the answer will be no or sorry, can't do that. Food is okay, standard chain fare for Buco. Nothing special. You know what you will get. Service is the bigger disappointment.<//Text>

This has got to be one of my favorite Italian restaraunts. Not too fancy and overpriced, but still able to keep the quality of the food and service very high. Definitely recommend visiting here< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) This Italian restaurant is the only restaurant I've ever seen in the kitchen. As soon as I entered one day, I followed the staff to say that I would visit the kitchen, but it was very clean. The style has many old photos, so you can feel the old atmosphere. The family having a birthday party also stood out and felt comfortable.

(Original)
이곳 이탈리아 음식점은 내가 주방에 직접 들어가 구경해본 유일한 음식점이다. 언젠가 들어가자마자 주방을 구경시켜주겠다고 하여 직원을 따라 돌아봤는데 아주 청결하엤다. 스타일은 옛사진이 많이 걸려있어 올드 분위기를 느낄 수 있다. 생일 파티를 하는 가족도 눈에 띄어 편안한 느낌이 들었다.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c28740a299009d:0x3130650270e14272</gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) Salad was good but the spaghetti was the worst spaghetti I ever had. It just taste like wheat and nothing. Chicken was just too greasy.

The atmosphere is good, but the food is messy ..
Salad or appetizer is delicious
I feel chicken cooking
Carbonara feels like chewing flour ...
Tomato spaghetti was too tasty because the noodles were too ripe;
No nuclear program

분위기는 좋은데 음식이 똥망임..ㅎ
샐러드나 에피타이저는 맛있는데
치킨요리는 느끼하고
까르보나라는 밀가루 씹어먹는 느낌...
토마토스파게티는 면이 너무 익어서 노맛이었음;

(Translated by Google) It was one of my favorites, but the last time I felt a change in the taste of different foods, I think it's not my favorite anymore, the salad if I like it, it's the same. So, tried!
