I stopped by the store this afternoon in desperate need of help. Female Store Manager and Otto were very helpful. They both were ready to help even though the issue I came in with was not auto related. The manager recommended several tools and WD 40. The WD 40 did the job and I was able to take care of the issue at hand. I am a Manager myself and recognize leadership and customer service. Both of these guys are great. Thank you so much for all the help.</review>

<text>Yvonne and Steven are two impeccable employees. They both made my experience amazing as I was greeted when walking in, assisted above and beyond, on top of feeling a family vibe even going back a second time. I was going to ask to speak to the manager but then I read Yvonne tag and it clicked why the staff are sooooo welcoming. Yvonne is truly amazing and I thank her for her amazing spirit.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1619880117126, 'text': "Thank you for the great feedback, Clayton!

Citlalli Rocks!
She is an amazing person behind the counter. Very helpful and kind lady. She's like the old team members in the store whom  I do not see any more anywhere in the stores. She deserves the best of the best on any costumer service counter. Specially on the AutoZone business. Thanks AutoZone  for hiring employees like her!< /text>

Love their customer service. Came in yesterday night Victor and the younger Latino guy gave us the best customer service we could ask for, calling around to help us find a phone mount for the car. We ended up ordering another one with them for next day pick up. Yvonne and the morning staff treated us with the warmest hospitality, we came so early the mount wasn’t there yet(8am when they opened). Just left at 12:30pm with our item and smiles. Even got to see our buddy Victor again! Thank you all for your excellent service during this critical time.< /review>

The experience was wholesome, each associate there came at me with attitudes that made me feel like this was my  home away from home! They helped me find each tool that was needed for my newest project, and Yvonne the store manager made the process of returns an absolute breeze and the purchase of new products a smooth procedure! Highly recommend you go to this particular location and enjoy yourself.</review>

I drive in to the new location in Inglewood with a flat tire on an SUV. Jesus R. was working on his day off at the new location. Not only was the manager (Crystal) a blessing, but Jesus was too. We discussed what products were in stock that could help my tire, and they both knew all the products, but they are willing to go above and beyond for you.

They were willing to stay after work on a rainy Friday night to make sure I had a solution. Crystal directed me to the local business where I am at this moment getting a new tire. (It’s almost midnight.) Jesus assured Crystal he would and help me so that Crystal could feel comfortable going home. Jesus did everything to take my flat off but it wasn’t working so he called his family and they came to help us. Nearly an hour and a half AFTER getting off of work on his off day, did we finally get the spare on.

I can’t begin to thank Jesus and Crystal enough, especially Jesus. Jesus told me that Autozone rewards it’s employees for doing things like this, and I hope it’s enough because they DESERVE it! If I had my own company I would steal them, no questions.< /Text>

The items were not in stock at her location but explained that she could order them and it would arrive in a timely manner.  I was highly impressed with her demonstration of exercising extreme patience with me as a Senior Citizen customer.

Ms. Deja also informed and expounded on the benefits of signing up for your member’s points program etc. She completed all these task quickly!

I could have picked up my products on yesterday but purposefully came this afternoon so I could tell her how much I appreciated the excellent customer service that she provided on Thursday evening.  I was
Surprised that when I approached the counter on today, she was fully aware of who I was and why I was there, even though she had serviced many other people since my first visit at Auto Zone.

Upon walking out of the store, I asked for the Store’s Manager.  I told him about her impeccable work ethics and psychic income.  “ This young lady desires to be PROMOTED whenever the opportunity arises” according to GOD’S WORD.  Psalms 75:6

Sincerely,
Darlene McFaddin-Robinson

An asset to the company.She went EXTRA MILES helping me with the grade and oil my car needed as well as helping me to get the engine oil CAP that fell into the engine block, thing that would've been very HARD for me to do.
Thanks for training your employees on how to go THAT EXTRA MILE for the customers..I am very grateful to her.

This is the auto part store to get ALL of your auto parts and vehicle accessories from I HIGHLY recommend it! And not to mention the customer service support was Phenomenal! I needed help looking for some valve cover screw bolts for my SUV and the MGR Rudy Washington helped me find some with no problem at all.... he even put them on for me as well. Now I'm good to go. Thanks man I truly appreciate it sir and also to Christal I believe that's her name!</Review>

I wont go to any other donut shop! The jelly donut store has the best freshly made donuts you will ever taste!
The owners are so customer service orientated and have been in business at this location for over 20 years. You have not had the best donuts on this planet untill you have had a donut from the Jelly donut shop. My mouth is watering as i type this.
If you plan on going there to get a mouth watering lovely donut from Jelly donut shop you'd better make it there early because they sell out everyday so get there before 10 am otherwise its slim pickens but what ever is left will still be the best donut you ever ate.< /Text>

Solid local donut shop. Reasonable selection of the usual donuts.  Space to have coffee and a chat while you eat.  The man at the counter was chearful while I only had one eye open still. Donuts were a little doughier then my perfect but within range. I'll be glad to stop again<//review>

Our family has gone to The Jelly Donut for years because they simply have the best donuts and are the friendliest people.  Nick and Lina are always so cheerful and greet their regular customers by name and make you feel like you are in a Mom and Pop type of atmosphere.  Great experience every time!<//Text>

I can't say go enough things about this place. I got an oil change and smog done in under 45 minutes with no prior appointment! The staff was friendly and knew what they were doing. They were constantly hustling from car to car and getting them done.< /Text>

I am a multi car family, had all my major service, and maintenance for the last 15 years done here. But this morning I drove up early, first van there to have an oil service, and when doors opened not one employee came out to the car drop off area to take first car there? All the other vehicles that came after me got full service and had there cars pulled into service bays before me? I've never been so embarrassed, and insulted before. Customer no more..Sad ...my loss<//review>

<Text>This was the best oil change experience I’ve had in a long time. The second I walked up a man walked in and greeted me. The friendly man instantly recognized my car, (most places can’t recognize my unpopular older car) asked all vital questions, and got to work. The change was $60 for full synthetic. All bays were full. I wasn’t waiting more than 10 minutes and they had promptly completed the change. He let me know that my vehicle had the engine of a Cadillac, something no mechanic could tell me in the 2 years I’ve owned the car. 5/5 would recommend, I’m going to return here in the future for all oil changes. Go here if you want staff working on your vehicle who are knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient.</Text>< pictures>

Wasn't really the best experience going there for the first time. I went in for an oil change, I didn't mind the wait but what really got me was the fact they tried to sell me a serpentine belt for $163 alone. The only reason it was $163 dollars was because it was a "big belt", his words. Serpentine belts, cost around $23 bucks, so in general he wanted $140 for labor. I know this because I had the belt replaced before I got there. And when I came home, I popped open my hood to check myself and someone must have some shaky hands because there was oil all over my engine. Not happy at all with this place. If you're going to con someone out of their money you might as well try to be a little more convincing than just saying "The only reason it's going to cost $163 is because it's a big belt." I nearly slammed my hood on his greedy fingers for that. Not going back ever again.< /Text>

<username>Jerry Beatty<//username><review>I have taken my truck to them for the last few oil changes and while they are always professional and get the job done (it's an oil change for god sakes) they have never gone out of the way to be friendly.

Today was not that day.  As we speak, I am getting my oil changed for the last time here.  One person in particular, G.W., is rude, contentscious and wears dark glasses and never makes eye contact with the customer.  What's more, they do not honor the national Econo Lube n Tune coupons and discounts opting to offer thier own coupons in an antiquated form of mailers which are always thrown away as junk mail.

Although the oil gets changed, what keeps clients coming back is customer service, especially in light of today's social media content where any business is under the microscope.  Econo Lube n Tune fails badly here.  G.W. needs to be demoted to janitor.  he is not a good person to put in front of your customers.< /review><pics>None</pics>< date>

<text>I have visited once before and didn't have a problem. Went in today for an oil change and the clerk was to busy trying to sell me a new serpentine belt, transmission flush and air filter (over $300 worth) that I don't need  (I had someone check) that he forgot to check the fluids in my truck.  I checked and there was ZERO coolant in my truck!! Bone dry. Zero.  Will never go back.  Terrible terrible. I'd give them no stars if I could.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80ec6ca829c47b39:0xe4e8a64d8e35ea4f< /Gmap_id></record>

I had called the Auto Shop to get an estimate on replacing my fog lights they told me 95 bucks an hour and could go upto 400 depending on how hard it was. So knowing better I called Econo right off the bat told me $50-60 and I would be ok. Made an appointment got them both replaced i brought in my own parts and they charged $40! Hands down best prices in town. Quick and helpful staff! Dont waste your time pricing other places! Econo definitely came through!</review>

Totally mislead, I've been going there for years. Spoke with manager, didn't seem to care too much. Getting responses like I've been here 8 years, and my time is money. Is not what you want to hear. I didn't even get a chance to meet in the middle. I never ever done a review on no one. Very disappointed in this place. I will never go back!</Review>

Car didnt start getting worked on for 30-45 minutes after that. I sat their the entire time and the mechanic maybe spent 30 minutes on my car in a two and a half hour period of me waiting. Still got charged for the full hour. Plus i believe they round off their parts charges as well. $40 for an oil pressure sensor seems pretty steep and they wont let you bring your own parts! Staff seems friendly, but didnt seem to care when i had asked why the car hadnt been being worked on. Have had oil changes before and they are good and fast, but i wouldnt go further.</text>< Rate>

This will my 3rd car going for car tint in Oasis.. very very satisfied with the overall quality, technical staff they have. Oasis tint folks make sure to explain you different types of tint avaialble, demonstrate how actually it will look on your car.

Satisfied rate 5/5 for quality, value for money and overall satisfaction<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I've been meaning to get my car tinted for awhile now, called around several places. I have extremely sensitive skin and have been doing my research on the grade and quality of tint I would need, especially since I do so much driving. I ended up choosing ceramic which was extremely well worth the price, when you are looking to fully protect your skin and your car. When I contacted Oasis, I spoke with Andy whom was extremely informative and professional. Their prices were very reasonable and competitive with other places I've talked to but the main reason I went with Oasis was because Andy was extremely accommodating, professional, and it shows that there is integrity when it comes to their work and business ethics. I'm very satisfied with the quality of the work that was done. I went with 20% all around with 2-ply nano ceramic tint and 70% on the windshield. The technician didn't try to rush his work. He took his time to give me a good quality tint job and for that, I'm greatful. Thank you!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMwoRoRZrvCKcBfvZUw0ooKbTk91bfeXPLvngo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD5AKmgq3PWpb1iexjFentMMYPQ5OuuwsguD44=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqc81FiDKxhDMvCE1P2WkzR9797pojvh1NlFdV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbxam5GWrmipKJU175YijMoG6t7yaCC58SU2hX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFEiCuSzkwZWuYk_vThQjzg0OaAZlQovp0HvCH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dbf8c9e528e421:0x940520389cb3f985</GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Excellent Job. Not a bubble or bad spot in sight. Easy to work with and very kind throughout the whole process. Added bonus, the tech said it would take 3 hours to complete the job and guess what, 3 hours later it was done. I'll be telling my family and friends about this place.</Text><gmapID>0x80dbf8c9e528e421:0x940520389cb3f985</gmapID>< userid>

<Review>I found Oasis Trade online when I was searching for tinting company to do my 2020 prius. One of the company that came up is Oasis. They have deal in Groupon but when I call them to setup an appointment, Andy the manager said he can beat the Groupon price and straight up told me he can save me  more money. Andy is a very honest guy and reasonable. I compared their price to other company in the area, definitely his price is more reasonable. Also they use Rayno tint which is one of the best tint comparable to other leading companies. Definitely recommend this company and will use again for my future cars tint job.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Absolutely recommend Oasis Trade to anyone! Andy is the nicest guy ever! I have worked with him on multiple occasions and always offers amazing customer service. I worked with him on tinting a commercial building for work and my personal car, both times I received great service and results. Very happy! Thank you Andy!</review>

Took some time for appointment but end result is very nice. Car looks better and the difference was instantly noticeable. Has cool UV light to see the difference for different tints and has a cool tint that's clear yet super effective (though expect to pay a bit extra for this awesome premium tint). *HINT I called instead of wasting time looking onlinr and they let me know their current best deal.<//review>

Oasis did an outstanding tint job! I recommend using Oasis for any high-end vehicle. He literally made my window tint on my Mercedes look like it was from the factory. I will definitely be returning for future vehicles. Thanks so much!!💯💯< /Text>

<Review>I found this place on Groupon and was supposed to pay less that $200 for my car to be tinted. When I talked to Andy he told me it would be more because what I was wanting was not included in the Groupon. Apparently the Groupon is for 5 standard tint windows and I wanted 7. That was understandable. The shop looked a lil sketchy but he does good work out of it. He got me with the upsale and Im so happy he did. The NANO Ceramic is definitely worth the extra money. The downside is a piece of equipment broke and what was supposed to be a couple of hours turned into 4 HOURS. Finally he came to get me and I walked out to an unfinished job. All but the rear window was complete. I ended up coming back for him to finish 3 days later and it was done in 20 mins. With the exception of a couple of bubbles he smoothed out I would say he did a fair Job.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>First time getting my car windows tinted and have to say how great of an experience it was going through Oasis Trade Inc.

They took their time in helping me select the best type of tint and shade for my car. They even helped me save more money on the front windows.
I found this place though Groupon and after working with them I wish I had talked to them first before purchasing it from Groupon and use the fee for extra savings with Oasis Trade Inc.</Text>< user_id>

They had great reviews and when I called Andy was very nice, knowledgeable, and accommodating. I had to change my appt. twice and still I had a great experience on the phone each time. When I arrived, I was given a short demonstration on how much each tint type would block the sun’s heat. We discussed the options and I decided on the ceramic tint and also to tint my windshield. He gave me a very fair price and told me what time the truck would be done. It was done a bit earlier and the truck looks awesome!!! And if you decide to wait there, Andy has an air conditioned waiting room where you can watch movies, use their computer, or just read in comfort! All in all a great experience. I will be back to tint the windshield on my Subaru. Thanks Andy!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I found the company off of groupon and bought the 5 rear window package. I didn't even realize it was the rear package and I thought it was all the windows but he was able to help me out to get what I wanted without cancelling and having to go somewhere else. They were very knowledgeable about the product and gave me the prices for for the additional front windows. I have to say these guys saved me a lott of time and confusion. Scheduled me an appointment and installed my tint quickly. Good place. I'm satisfied.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuu4oDEUOXq6pV4xI_Qf2EZ9GJfNfoKo5lLDuy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Professional, honest, and a pleasure to deal with. I had my old tint removed, and had 7 windows re-tinted. I will bring my other vehicles here as soon as I get a chance.

<text>I came to Oasis Trade to get my windows tinted with a recommendation from a family member. I am very satisfied with the customer service, their availability, and the quality of their work. I tinted my windows with carbon tint and it was a very good price, much better than the other window tinting place I called. I would rate my experience here 10/10 because the man I talked to was very friendly and informed me of the regulations for tinting in California, and was very transparent with me. I would gladly come back here again to get my next car tinted.< /text><gmap_id>0x80dbf8c9e528e421:0x940520389cb3f985</gmap_id><date>1566675958798</date>< name>

This is a great shop to work with! Super friendly, very informative, and some of the best prices in town. Not to mention they do excellent work. Thanks for explaining the huge benefits of using ceramic tinting. My car interior stays so much cooler now!<//Text>

< Review>
First time here, and visiting from LA recommended by a friend. Andy does great work. And his pricing is second to none. I watched the whole process of my car getting tinted and these guys make it look so easy. They take a lot of care in cleaning and prepping the windows before applying the tint. Andy carries a whole spectrum and will walk you through what is allowed in each state as a bench for what you'd like to tint. The difference is night and day. Will come here again for my other vehicles and recommend to friends.< /Review>

One year later and I’m back again! Andy and his team did an amazing job on my new car. They scheduled me right in and I love how the tint enhances the look of my vehicle. I will be bringing in my daughter’s new car for tinting In. a few weeks.

This is the fourth car that I have brought to Oasis for window tinting! The man that installed my tint was super friendly, and Andy was great as always. They are always helpful and thorough in explaining my options. ( I appreciate that because I don’t want to feel like I have to bring my boyfriend or brother with me.) I told him that I would be back, and I meant it!<//text>

Andy and his team at Oasis were very helpful.  They offered a reasonable bid and were very knowledgeable.  They went over tints, films, and the different standards to ensure I was not just getting what I was asking for but what I needed and wanted.  The best part was that one window had a bubble a week later, nothing large, pretty minute actually but I took it in and they put on a whole new tint to the window.  It’s nice to know that you have the security of guaranteeing a good job.  It’s not always like that with competing companies.  I’d recommend Andy and his team at Oasis to my friends and family.<//Review>

I learned about this place through Groupon. They worked on both of my cars. First 2013 Nissan Altima and 2016 Nissan Maxima. Initially I had no issues with the tint I even recommended this place to my coworkers and friends. However lately I notice major bubbling on the rear window of my Nissan Maxima and bubbling, tint became hazy as well last lost its color on my Nissan Altima.  I still have the original receipts and they both state limited life time warranty for the exact issues i am currently experiencing. I called the place and initially person on the phone started to argue with me about the warranty. The he asked me to texted him the receipt which I did. I did not hear from them ever since. I called the place on multiple occasions and no one picked up. I received a text stating they will call me back soon however it’s been two weeks. Now they phone line stating that their voice mail box is full. I have no idea what will happen to this business post COVID 19 but I would highly discourage people from going to this place. It’s been truly a disappointing experience.</Review>

I did my tesla model 3 tint here. Andy is amazing and explained me about all the types of tints and about percentages. I choose ceramic tint and the outcome is very beautiful. He made my car more attractive by adding the tint to my lovely Red colour model 3. Price is very reasonable when compare to other services in San Diego. For sure I will recommend for your car tint.<//review>

<Review>PLEASE READ THIS! VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

To begin with I found out about Oasis on Groupon  and I purchased the 5 window CERAMIC tint  for $249 but when I called to make an appointment he said he will charge me $150 extra for front. So I canceled the Groupon immediately. Andy the owner Oasis trade tint called me and offered same day appointment for $300. I went ahead to Oasis at 2:30 and told him I'll STAY, while I was waiting outside I checked if he I'd really using CERAMIC($200 more than regular film), sure enough they tried to rip me off by trying to install regular film. I had to tell to use the ceramic. And then he took out the regular film and used the CERAMIC.
First I thought it was a honest mistake but one of the guys I know happened to be there at the same time while dropping off the car. I texted him to let him(V is his first initial) know what happened, and he went to the Oasis Tint and sure enough they did the same thing to him. You probably will see a review from V on yelp and Google reviews.

PLEASE avoid this a tint service and if you decide to get it anyway PLEASE DO NOT DROP OFF YOUR ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE PAYING FOR EXPENSIVE PREMIER FILM. Make sure you stay there and get the work done in your presence. BBB has to know about his rip off patterns and wrong business practice. I really can't imagine how many people he has done this to. It's hard to say if the film is ceramic unless you have right devices to detect and guage incoming rays, not many people would have those machines so it's literally not possible to know if he has installed what you pay for cause they all look the same.

If you're the owner reading this, eventually you'll get caught by right authorities. It isn't so hard to be honest as you're already making 60-70% profit on any sale.<//Review>< gmapID>

I found this place from Groupon and I’m glad I chose Oasis to do my car windows tinting. Andy was really professional in explaining the process and the differences between the type of tints so I can pick the right one for my vehicle that will last a life time. I love the way my car look after tinting the windows. I would recommend this place to my friends and family if they need to tint their vehicles too. Thanks Andy. Great job 👍< /text>

I just bought a brand new 2019 Infiniti Q50. Oasis Tint was the first place I contacted. They were so professional on the phone that I made an appointment. These guys are the best! Fast, Friendly, Efficient, so much attention to detail. They go beyond service. If you need your windows tinted and want the best look no further.</Text>

<text>A friend referred me to Oasis Trade Window Tinting. Upon arrival to the business I was met by Andy, the owner. Andy was very nice and educated me on the different types of tint packages. He only uses the best quality tint to ensure longevity of his work. Him and his team were really professional and the end result was really impressive. I strongly encourage those who are seeking tinting for their car, boat, RV, etc. to choose Oasis. Oasis offered better quality and pricing than other competitors.</text><Rating>5<//Rating><response>None</response><Name>kyle Veltri<//Name>< date>

I just bought a car, and was in a hurry to get the windows tinted, to protect the inside from the heat. Andy was more than willing to accommodate my short notice, booking me an appointment within 2 hours. When I arrived he was extremely knowledgeable and professional, patiently explaining the difference between each quality of tint and how it could protect my new car. I ended up going with the ceramic tint, which is the best for keeping my car nice and cool. Andy was more than fair, in giving me a great price. “Thank you Andy”, I look forward to the next time I need any tinting done.< /text>

Oasis Trade (San Diego) has tinted 3 of our cars. Andy and his team are always professional and does a great job. Recommended making an appointment before showing up.  Had a minor cosmetic issue, without hesitation Andy worked with me to resolve the issue. Andy has this new front window tint that is within California tinting law and keeps the pounding rays of the sun from heating up the car. Highly recommend getting your windows tinted if you have young children, it helps their comfort in the car.</review>

<Review>If you’re looking to get new tinting done for your car, give Andy a call. He is super friendly, down to earth, and offers very honest prices.
Tinting is professional and done in a reasonable time. There are several shops in the same plaza that you can visit while the tinting job is being done as well.
Highly recommended! Give him a call!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I took my 2014 Mazda3 in Tuesday morning. Tint was done within a hour and half minutes. Andy was really helpful for me to decide what product and percentage go for tint. After finishing work, it was really nice and looked great!!

There was also a nice waiting room. I could spend time during the work. It was first time get tint on my car and really great. If you come to this shop, you will get a reasonable price and the best customer service.<//text>

Got two cars tinted here they do an amazing job, and have the best quality.
I wouldn’t trust the regular tint/stereo shops but definitely trust this one! Yes it’s more expensive than those but why would you want to get anything less for your car?
He explained all the types and made sure I understood everything and felt comfortable with whatever choice I made. He also gave me a great price which I really appreciated!!
Plus their waiting room is comfy and he didn’t care I had my doggy with me. I definitely recommend these guys. My car looks amazing!<//review>

<review>This is the 3rd vehicle I’ve brought in to Andy at Oasis, and there is a reason for it. He takes care of his customers, both loyal and new, and is very professional when discussing different options for each vehicle. He takes the time to ensure the proper product and shade is applied, explaining the differences and costs in a transparent manner. Looking forward to doing more business with Oasis!<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dbf8c9e528e421:0x940520389cb3f985<//Gmap_id><Name>daulton abernathy</Name>< rate>

Oasis trade once again delivered an excellent service. I've used oasis trade inc  to do the tint on all my cars and they back  it up with excellent warranty. They recently repaired a 4  year old tint  in my car at no cost. They fixed the problem and it looks superb! The owner and the staffs are super friendly. It was the easiest warranty transactions i've experienced. I HIGHLY recommend OASIS TRADE INC for all your tint jobs. You will never see any other  company that value their customers like OASIS trade inc.</Text>

I took my car to Oasis Trade Window tinting and they did a spectacular job on it! I did my research before I took it there tough. I literally called every single shop that tints windows in San Diego County. To tint my car with 5 windows I was quoted anywhere from $160-$280. Essentially I did all the work for you... Oasis will give you the best price. Don't let that make you think they do a second rate job though. First off they said it would take about 2 1/2 to 3 hours to tint my windows and it only took them 1 hour and 15 minutes. Not only that though they really did a great job... my car looks cooler and is cooler inside thanks to the tint. When you go there they will walk you through the whole process on choosing whatever tint is best for you. There will be a few bubbles in the tint when you come and pick your car up, but don't worry you can bring the car back to them after the tint dries and they will smooth them out. And, best of all, the tint comes with a lifetime guarantee. They did such a great job, that my brother and step dad are having their cars tinted there too!<//text>

Outstanding service! I did a little research before actually seeing any shops. But the amount of knowledge these gentlemen have will make anyone feel at ease. They have great deals backed by an even better warranty. Highly recommend.</Review>

Highly recommend Oasis Trade for your window tinting needs.  They are very courteous  and friendly. Like how I was shown different options of shades and different options for the Kooltek window tinting, ranging from the standard to the best quality which is the Ceramic. They show you the difference between them using a heat lamp for you to feel how much heat they each block. Received great deal to have all 7 windows plus front window tinted. :) My car turned out beautiful! !<//text>

These guy’s are the best!! I had my Lexus windows tinted her over 8 years ago and still yet to see any bubbling or peeling. It did fade color a bit which is expected of literally sitting in the sun all those years lol. I just brought our 2019 VW Atlas and tinted all 9 windows the top of the line Carbon Crystalline Film and man my car is soo much cooler on the inside after being in the sun and looks amazing. Andy was great to deal with not push and helps you find exactly what you are looking for. The technicians that do the work are very nice and take there time and it looks great. Thanks guys i really recommend and will be taking all my vehicles here. Also includes a great warranty which will make anyone feel comfortable. Thanks again Andy and to all the technicians.< /review>

I took my new dodge ram and had all my windows done with 20% ceramic film and the windshield with 75% ceramic film.

<Review>excellent Tint work - very reasonable and reliable. I had the Ceramic tinting for my entire minivan. No exaggeration, but i don't need to use A/C 95% of the times even in sunny days / long drive. Another best complement is to turn of the A/C when i was just running fan on a 90 degrees temperature day :-)<//Review><rating>5</rating><gmap_id>0x80dbf8c9e528e421:0x940520389cb3f985</gmap_id>< Pictures>

Got the original tint done in 07/08. Came back to get the rear window redone (bubbling).

Andy was very helpful and nice. He honored the lifetime warranty and I was off in a few hours.

Overall great customer service and product.<//Review>

This is a little mom and pop shop off the beaten path, but they take their craft very seriously and do a stupendous job with tinting. I took my new Subaru in and they tinted 9 Windows for $269, a fraction of what other companies were asking. Also, it's warranteed so I know I can rely on continued support. I highly recommend Oasis Trade.<//review>

< Review>
Got the groupon and it was a good deal. Groupon was for 5 windows but my SUV has 9, but I was still given a reasonable price for the additional 4 windows and with a higher quality ceramic tint that blocks more heat. When I picked up my car after it was sitting in the sun for awhile, it was noticeably cooler than usual - which is nice because I have black leather that gets HOT! Customer service so far has been prompt and good. Only took them about 2 hours to do the 9 windows as well.</Review>

Best window tinting in San Diego! They made my Chevy Volt look and feel cool! And their prices were unbeatable! I fully recommend Oasis Trade window tinting!< /text>

< review>
I called and was directed to my closest san diego location. All good, till the phone went to voicemail after one ring. Next I heard the voicemailbox for this number is full. That's beyond STUPID. Obviously a real group of intellectuals are at the helm here. ILL PASS! I'm sure this fine attention to detail runs all the way up! I think I know what the voicemail is full of and why it's not emptied.</review>

<Text>I bought a deal from livingsocial for Windows tint and made an appt. When I went in Tina informed me that I had to pay a little extra for the front driver and passenger side window. They did an awesome job on the tint and I couldn't be happier. They put tape over the window buttons to help remind me to not lower my windows (not a huge deal but just a great way to help out the customer). I would definitely go back for tint if I bought another vehicle.</Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This bus station is a front & has no attendants or security. You cannot go inside as it is a locked abandoned building. If you are looking to catch the Greyhound or Amtrak connection bus, you will be forced to stand on the side of the street while you wait for it to arrive. Your only other option would be to stop by the Chico Art Center and be kicked out by the owners, a building which is right next door to this excuse for a bus station. While I was visiting Chico State for a campus tour, I had to come here to catch the bus and was harassed by a homeless man. Im only 19 and live 7 hours away from Chico. The Chico Art Center staff specifically the owner refused to help shelter me, so I was forced to sit outside alone while my bus was still 2 hours away. Come here if you want to risk your life with no chance of help from anyone who lives here.</Review>

<Text>It's closed but kept clean and quiet.im doing an all nighter to catch my bus early in the morning. Security comes by and checks out the place. It's pretty safe well the whole chico pretty much is compared to where I live San Bernardino. Lol. But honestly I recommend this place.</Text><username>Jay< /username>< Time>

Super easy and not packed on either trip! Only confusing part is that it isn't clearly marked where to go. I went to the window and they pointed to where to go and from there it was easy-peasy! There are plenty of waiting benches and both times the bus was on time and the drivers were good drivers and courteous. Also, EXCELLENT COVID response. Masks required at all times and the drivers will tell anyone who removes their mask that it is required. Our driver did a check before leaving and told someone who removed his that he had to put it back on and waited until he did so before leaving. Excellent!</review>

<rating>2</rating><text>The bus that I took from Chico to Modesto had a 4 hour delay and the it was an hour and a half late to even get to Chico. Aside from that, don't have high expectations for the actual station. It's fairly outdated by the looks of it and isn't very clean. The bathroom is worse and you don't really want to be in there for too long. They have two benches inside which are fine. But yeah, the room is fairly dirty.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Could use a complete makeover. Good customer service but they close the ticket counter at 1 30 pm. I'm not sure if the lobby ( which also needs a makeover) and restroom area remains open after that but I seriously doubt it. Most of the waiting for the bus is done outside rain or shine with no real awning available. The busses are usually late with limited scheduling available. The prices are decent though and a good alternative for those of us who have no other choice.😉<//review>< Resp>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>The bus was four hours late.  They didn't come outside and tell people waiting for the bus.  The bus was late because it broke down the day before.  They had plenty of time to call another bus to pickup the schedule of ours that was late, but they didn't.  Poor business management.  Also, the print at home tickets can't be used on your phone, they want to keep the paper.  While this is their policy, it's a very poor way to treat your customers in the digital age.  Upgrade your software systems so you can print online tickets or start accepting digital tickets.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

< Review>
While the Greyhound bus is a cheap way to get to where I'm going, it's so often unreliable that I've come to expect major problems whenever I use their bus. The bus is often very late, if it even shows up at all. Sometimes it shows up on time or without too long a wait, but in my experience, it's about 50/50, which isn't very reliable for a bus service, especially if I need to get to the airport to catch a flight on time. I've waited for hours and hours, unsure of whether the bus was ever going to show, and unsure of how I'd get to my destination on time and whether to keep waiting, or find another method of transportation. Refunding your ticket is difficult, you need to send your ticket in by postal service mail to be considered. My last ticket was an e-ticket, so I submitted a request twice on their website asking how to refund an e-ticket and haven't gotten a response yet. The buses aren't too clean, I often find trash left behind by other riders, and the back of the bus smells due to the bathroom (which is nice to have for long bus rides, but I wish it was kept cleaner). This particular station (Chico) is often closed, so it's more like a bus stop.<//Review>

Terrible customer service.  Drivers are uniformly rude, cynical and aggressive, even when approached with a polite and reasonable question.  If you like being treated like scum on someone's boot, take a greyhound bus.  I won't pay to be treated this way again.   It's going to be Amtrak for me from here on out.<//text>

They upgraded!!! There are now plug on the bus and it doesn't smell to much anymore. (You cant count the smelly people) The only negative thing is that the bus was delayed an hour 😔.< /review>

<review>I didn't go with greyhound since they have a policy of NOT hiring people who actually speak English.  After three attempts to get info (I wanted to take my bike on the bus), I gave up since none could understand my question.  We are NOT talking about people who are bi-lingual.  We are talking about people who just learned English a week ago.  All three could not understand the word 'bike'.  Then there is the rudeness and stupidity of the staff that did, somehow, got hired knowing fluent English.  Greyhound must pay bottom of the barrel wages to get people this bad.  Take only and I mean ONLY, if you have no other choice.< /review>< response>

<Text>This is the WORST trip of my life. The bus drive was hella rude. He kept stoping the bus because one person was complaining. Never again would I take this. The bus came one hour late. He kept threating us that he would leave us in the road.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><user_id>116468532934077018795< /user_id><Gmap_id>0x808327ae122175cb:0x9e0da1168606244e<//Gmap_id>< Name>

The busses stink. They are also broke down and not well kept. Ridiculous 18$ gift fee if you buy the ticket for someone else on your credit card.  No more greyhound. Amtrak for me< /review>

<Review>I've been going to Jims for many years now. Restoring a 1965 Chevelle he's always been a great help. The entire staff has been amazing too and being that we travel from a distance to go there we call ahead and they make sure everything we need is ready and waiting for us.<//Review>< username>

There's a lot of left over foods in the refrigerator and dust all over my place. I tried calling different business that offers household services but they can visit my place the next day. I badly want to get rid of the mess so I tried asking some friends and one friend recommended Servpro. I immediately called Servpro and to my surprise they will send someone to visit and help me clean my place right away. It was a really nice experience and not to mention the price, its really affordable. Plus the helpers, you can see that they are very trustworthy and professional. They even gave me some tips on how to prevent things like this in the future. I will recommend this to my family and other friends and even to my neighbors. They clean my apartment better than I do lol. Thank you Servpro! The best one so far!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80e84d5c2ab03b63:0x50363f2cfeb174f8<//gmapID></record>

<date>1598666209736< /date><Text>My entire kitchen has been having problems with some fire damages ever since the pandemic arises. And since I cannot fix it all by myself, i was really wondering for someone to help me clean the mess. My husband even tried to scrape some of the damages but it made the problem a lot worse. My friend recommended me servpro for like thousand times. I was really hesitant to work out with a damage service company because it's a hassle for me. but then i guess i was wrong, servpro  did a pretty good thing with my fire damage in the kitchen now. I hope that i could send here some pics but I found oout that I already deleted the photos. so guys i tell you... servpro is one of the best. i will surely  go back and ask for their help. I'vve seen a lot of comments here praising omar, i can guarantee that he is really a great man! kudos servpro!< /Text><gmapID>0x80e84d5c2ab03b63:0x50363f2cfeb174f8< /gmapID><userid>102382673979509403345< /userid><resp>None<//resp><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rating>

<text>Servpro and their staff are very profesional. I am a strong independent woman until I had a clogged in my sink and I really don’t know what to do. Good thing I saw their service the other day fixing some problems in our neighborhood. I immediately called them and they went to my place right away. I am very glad theres a service provider like them who's always ready whenever someone called them. I really appreciate them for their professionalism and knowledge in everything they do.</text>< name>

Totally love the service!

Our home has a lot of accumulated molds that were hard to get rid of, and I don't want to bother cleaning those myself. Good thing, my friend recommend ServPro to me. They are very professional and efficient. I will contact them again if I ever need repair or restoration for our house.<//text>

A good service that I didn't expect at all! Thanks to those people who help us have a clean and nice home. I would definitely recommend you guys to have this restoration and cleaning services. Most especially, thanks to Omar who help us. It's quite stressful to find an appropriate service that will fit your needs. But servrpro did everything to make possible! We can't help but smile.  Please continue your good service not only to us but also to everyone who needs u guys. I might call you for cleaning in the next quarter again. So see you Omar and Team.</text>

I never doubt when I sister told me that I should try..to hire these people to clean and restore an area in my house. I'm happy now! I can finally cook meals for my kids without worrying about stuff. I can finally buy some cooking machines...and have my baking done! All thanks to Omar (not sure with his name... if correct..) thumbs up guys!</Review>< rate>

We've been too busy this past few days and a collegue of mine told me about Servpro Ventura's great service. They'd booked me an appointment right away even if I called late at night. Professionalism as it's finest!

They restored my house perfectly and my expectations were met. I will definitely need your services next time.</review>

ServPro Ventura was absolutely fantastic! They exceeded all of my expectations. They were quick and very polite. They were the first to actually answer the phone when we needed them. They took in mind how we felt after our fire. They were careful with the rest of our remaining belongings. They were fair priced for the great service. Highly recommend!< /text>

This was one-stop problem solving. At the end of an escrow, a roofing company accidentally drove a nail into the copper water line in the ceiling. The damage was extensive but the good work of this company saved the transaction and the first home for a Veteran buyer. Excellent work.</Review>

Aloha from Hawaii! A year ago in our home in Ventura, the worst nightmare for any homeowners happened to us. We had a major water leak and damaged a lot of our stuff from kitchen to living room. We called Servpro and was accommodated by a friendly representative. They scheduled our home the next day. They took care of our problem very efficiently without charging us an arm and a leg. I highly recommend this company. Keep it up guys!<//review>

Super, professional, quick response!  We discovered a moisture leak in a condo we were selling and we called Servpro Ventura. We were so lucky, Gonzalo showed up promptly, gave us a reasonable quote, did the job as quoted immediately.  Can't recommend them more highly - hope we don't need their services again but we know who to call!</review>

Friendly service. I rented a UHaul truck, but had to keep it longer than expected. They were hard to call though,  because they are often busy in their lot.<//Review>

<Review>Had a nail in my tire that caused a flat last week. It was 7:40 pm when I arrived there.  Leo took care of me right away.  In and out in less that 10 min and even said if we're closed just give him a call and he could take care of me. Next to impossible to try and find comparable service like this nowadays. Highly recommend.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Very quick, excellent service.  Auto mechanic was honest!  We have came here a couple different times because of the honesty and demeanor of the staff. Once you find a good honest person in the auto business, it is best to stay with them. Unfortunately all they do is tires... but every time we have tire issues, we go there.<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I went there to rent a U-Haul Van, and had to wait almost 30 minutes before someone waited on us to handle our pre-existing reservation. On top of that, Upon returning the van 55 minutes early, they actually tried to charge me an additional day. I had to contact Uhaul directly to get a refund plus tax for the extra day.< /text>< Pics>

Excellent service! Luna Tires was the third place I had gone in search of a used tire for my Ram 1500. After I was lied to at the first place, and blown off at the second, I was already expecting a pattern when I got to Luna. They were quick to help, gave me a few options between tires and prices, and even helped me figure out pricing for stuff I wasn't going to be buying anytime soon. All with friendly service, that most definitely stood above the competition. I highly recommend this place as your go-to for tires.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I arrived because the steering wheel was hitting me, it grabbed the sides, according to me, by a tire and it turned out that it was badly balanced by a weight that fell silent.

They all deserve 5 stars truly. The people that manage and operate what happens to the animals/business side of this shelter, and the direction they provide have lacked severely for years. The animals that are brought to this shelter deserve better.

That being said, if you are reading this review I still highly encourage you to attempt to get the dogs/cats/other pets they bring in because they deserve loving homes just as much as any other animal does. Except the unfortunate reality is that the animals that management considers to be “lost causes” end up being euthanized. So please still give your time to at least look at the animals up for adoption. Their lives depend on it.< /text><user_id>109288263620512743714</user_id></record>

I was thinking of adopting from this place, but after reading these comments, I am leery. I know that the dogs are separate and these employees are causing animals to be put down, but if I saw what everybody is describing, I would want to jailbreak all of them! I know times are tough jobwise, but why would you apply to work there if you you obviously don't like animals OR people?< /text>

Owning a pet (dog or a cat)i atleast $17,000 for owning a pet . Before you consider buying a pet think about that. Do you have the expenses to own a dog/cat almost worth the price of a new car. Since pet only provide company and maybe protection. Which doesn't Justify paying an insurance each year just own pet. Does a  pet actually contribute in a beneficial factor. Like expenses and taxes etc.< /review>

Worst run shelter, lackes organization and consistency. No one told us the same information twice, always a new piece of information.  We Almont did not get to adopt the found kittens we had dropped off. Said they would call us when they were available.  No call.<//Review>

<Review>I called @ about 12:30PM after I got notice of renewal for Rocco's county license. Notice says he qualifies for 1 year OR 3 years. Then said it may NOT exceed Rocco's rabies exp date.
When I called to clarify that even the one year license exceeds the new rabies due date - she interrupted "yeah?", I continued with my question- so can I license him for 3 years- she interrupted "if you WANT" , I continued, so does that mean that I can renew the rabies and keep the 3 year license. She said again "IF YOU WANT." I asked her but does that keep the license valid? "UGH - NO." Okay, last question - so in fact, my ONLY option is to purchase the one year- that is in fact only 10 months and no matter what it expires with his rabies. Her reply: "YEAHHH."
I was looking for clarification (this is my first time Licensing my dog as an adult) and got a woman clearly not into being nice or helpful. It is not my fault you're having a bad hair day, lady.
I wish I'd gotten her name.
She could have easily clarified and said that it is a typo and the 3 year does NOT qualify.
Instead she was intentionally obtuse & extremely rude. I hope no one in an emergency gets this lady. Awful. If you're not into helping people then please don't be in customer service.</Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< UserId.>

Very very disappointed, I made an appointment yesterday as soon as they opened and was told that I did not have to worry about the dog I was viewing being adopted previous to my appointment. I wish I remembered the name but I can’t recall. They send you paperwork VIA email where you even sign and initial an adoption agreement prior to your appointment . I showed up after driving from paso, and was told that the dog I was viewing was currently in the process of being adopted ???? How is that even possible. I explained how I called as soon as they opened and due to me working today I wasn’t able to go to the shelter till after I was off. And I called literally as soon as they opened to make an appointment and was TOLD specifically TOLD that this exact Situation WOULD NOT happen. When I explained this to the lady at the front she basically said ??? Oh well?? And that I spoke with the main office and she doesn’t know why they would tell me that ? Seriously GET IT TOGETHER. Communicate with your main office and whatever else so they aren’t giving away FALSE INFO. Seriously broke my heart to not be able to adopt the dog I wanted and I don’t mean to sound like a brat but to be told something and then have the opposite happen is not right especially after driving 35 mins just to get to the facility. Pretty annoying too that I showed the adoption agreement I signed and yet it meant absolutely nothing ? So I will never adopt or attempt to adopt here ever again. And I encourage those to make sure you get there ASAP if you are trying to adopt a specific animal. Very very disappointed and if I could give 0 stars I would.<//text>

PLEASE give this shelter a chance. Go for all the dogs and cats there, adopt them and give them a great life. I recently bought 50 plush blankets for the kennels and all the pets loved them! It feels better to help, then to criticize.<//review>

My husband and I found a dog running on North River road this morning. We were able to catch him and brought him into animal regulations. The staff were extremely grateful to us for rescuing him and they immediately took him into their care. He did not appear to have any injuries but they checked him thoroughly. It was very hard to avoid the temptation to adopt him on the spot but the staff were so caring they made me feel that he was in good hands.
We have adopted 5 dogs from this facility, 2 of which are still with us. This facility does an AMAZING job and we would adopt more if we could. And we will not adopt from anywhere else.< /review>

Terrible environment and conditions for the cat. It was not clean. Also, one kitten was in a kennel with no food, water, or litter. It was forced to urinate and poop on the floor where it would walk through. I was able to find food, water, and litter for it myself. I hope these are not the regular conditions for these poor animals. One volunteer I saw did not seem friendly with the dogs as well.</Review>

Very disappointed.  I could not make changes so the info would read correct and I did not know the breed of the cat.  The site limits people who are trying to adopt and do not necessarily know all the info.  This cat showed up on our porch starving to death it was so weak.  Because I could not get the program to change from female to male, I could not post the lost cat.  We are willing to adopt the cat if we can find it, but we can't seem to post the information.  I've been trying for over an hour and have to give up.  Sad.<//Text>

As soon as he came up to the counter to "help", he had attitude right away. The way he treated my husband and I ruined our whole morning. We came in with an issue that we were hoping to be solved quickly and easily and it turned out to be a whole new issue! I know we cannot be the only ones who felt this way and I am hoping someone with more authority can have a few words with this guy and maybe give him a few lessons on courteous customers service!<//Review>< gmap_id>

Great place to save a pup.  This shelter is full of great animals and good people.  We adopted a pup from them and are very pleased, don't forget to check these guys out on your search for a pet.  This is the place where the pets NEED you.<//Text>

<Review>We adopted a kitten...and the staff were very helpful, answered the phone promptly and a delight.  Since our kitten was too young for neutering, we scheduled a follow-up visit several months later and the drop off and pickup were quick and easy.  Couldn't ask for better service.</Review>< Pics>

Treated poorly by more than one employee. Discovered that statements were documented by them as being stated that never were actually stated. When asked if phone conversations were recorded to prove that certain things were or weren't said, I was laughed at and told, "we don't have to do that here." The employee I spoke with today - Ani was particularly condescending toward the end of our conversation and was not at all understanding or helpful. So incredibly disappointed in a place that is supposed to be helpful and compassionate.< /review>

<Review>The director, Eric Anderson, is the worst thing for this shelter. He's barely ever there(yet pulls a HUGE salary), is the one person there who cares the least about the animals, & abuses his power to do "favors" for his friends & political associates. He retired a long time ago, but collects his giant paycheck on our dime. He also cusses out customers & volunteers behind their backs. None of the employees respect or even like him, but they definitely fear him. Most of the employees care for the animals quite a bit, & they get a bad rap from the local community. They do the best they can, given the dilapidated facilities & poor leadership that they have to endure. Kennel staff, especially the manager, can DEFINITELY use some customer service training, as they can often be moody & rude. The volunteers can overstep their boundries sometimes, but really are the lifeblood of caring for these animals. This county NEEDS the new facility that's being proposed, but replacing the director with someone who wants to actually do the job can go a long way.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>I'm so disappointed after visiting this place twice. They clearly do not take very good care of the animals, cages full of poo.
The cats are heartbreaking. There was a sickness going around, and the 2 older ladies didn't even care that 1 kitten had blood coming from his nose, had sneezed and sprayed blood all over the walls, i mentioned it and one of them said "Oh He's fine". He obviously wasnt.
There is a cat there right now, picked up for cruelty, and she's filthy. They haven't bothered to do anything for her! It wouldn't hurt then to give the poor girl a bath and medical care to get her adoption ready.
These people pretend to care, but it's obvious they just don't.
Heartbreaking.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80ece556fd06c8f5:0xc6dd54c5ffcc555b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We want to help a dog in need and whoever answered was very short and annoyed that we were bringing something up that they had investigated before.  I was trying to explain what my intentions were, he talked over me, totally steam rolling what I was saying - saying he was going to transfer me and I asked him to wait and listen because I still had questions, he kept talking and just transferred me to his director mid sentence without answering any of my questions I wanted to ask.  When I originally brought up the topic he just said “we already investigated that I don’t know what you want.”  No inclicnation what so ever that he wanted to help me, just apparently dumbfounded by the idea that I would bring something up that they already investigated... nothing service oriented about the interaction.<//Text>

I've been to the shelter several times and I actually just adopted a pup and the staff all seemed very happy and nice and most the dogs looked very good but of course there were a few that looked scared but that's normal I mean they were probably just rescued but over all its an amazing place.</review>

Worst McD I have ever visited. It's not once or twice. 4 times! Cold food, wrong order and they just toss sauce in the bag, nothing you actually order. Spoken to the manager he fixed the first meal. Should not need to go back and have everything remade! Run a restaurant! Stop covid excuses!</Text>

They serve splendid meals, their menu is varied, The chief cook in that spot is a real authority in the kitchen, I like a lot trying all their food. The food is always tasty, the service towards the customers  is nice. I visit often this place and I was never unsatisfied.

<Review>Did the curbside pickup for breakfast and didn't have to wait long. About a 5-6 min wait. I also have to mention that they made sure to include enough napkins, ketchup, and a cup holder. Cuz we all know how famous they are for forgetting the napkins and ketchup. Lol.</Review>< userid>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>I hate to complaint, but I need to leave this here as a record of my visit to this place. I ordered the travis scott meal, but the food was barely cooked. It was almost raw. I hope I don't get sick. They messed up my cafe latte too. It taste and looks more like regular coffee. Plus it was spilled outside the cup. I gave them two stars, because at least they were nice about it.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2972e64eaab3f:0x27c5763dcbdd07f8</Gmap_id></record>

Ordered quarter pounder with cheese that tasted hot and fresh was delicious. The strawberry banana smoothie was refreshing and delicious and my friend ordered a caramel frappuccino that she thought tasted great as well. Didn't wait long in the drive thru and everything we ordered was perfect. This is a great McDonald's location.</review>

I don't really like them to eat that but sometimes I buy them but on surtain occasions. For me the only thing that I would eat from here was salads but they don't have them anymore . Oh I remember for breakfast I like the oatmeal that they make. But I don't like their customer service when I go inside the McDonald's but in the drive-thru its ok.</Text>< pictures>

Staff is cool, just a super busy location. Lobby was kinda dirty, the mens restroom is really clean though. The short haired girl behind the counter is polite and service is fast fast here. Order wasn't accurate either. Still okay for McDonald's< /Text>

<Review>Well, it's Mickey D's. There's only so much that can be said about it. That said, the Van Nuys and Blythe McDonald's has been completely redone, inside and out.

It now has an ordering kiosk, so ordering for kids who might be a little picky with food is easy. You can customize your order, and the kitchen gets all the minutiae.

Not bad for a place that's the poster child for homogenized American corporate culture.<//Review>< pictures>

Carlos at the cashier the first window through the drive thru has Excellent customer service , polite, joyful voice , and with a smile . I felt so welcomed . Hope corporate sees this comment and helps him move up in the company because he has potential! Been coming here many times through the drive thru and still has the same excellent customer service. 👍< /Text>

You said I visited their 5 months ago but the one closest to me I visited within the last month and found their food to be a Little on the salty side so you might wanna request not too much salt if you have a problem with that. The food was actually okay and the burger tasted like they had actual meat in it instead of what they used to serve whatever that was so I liked my meal and it was inexpensive</review>

I ordered my food at 10:21 am its 10:45 and I'm still waiting for my food I'm sitting here writing this as i wait for my food. I asked the lady serving the food if she knew what was going on with my food she walked away from me and didnt even bother to let me know. I'm very upset with this mcdonalds and the service I got here was horrible and took way too long.< /Text>

Some employees could use a lesson on how to make a customer feel welcome. little things like looking the customer in the eye, greeting them and actually speaking to them instead of walking up, punching a few buttons and then  walking away would be a useful skill for the manager / crew chief.
P. S. Why does sweet tea take 4 whole minutes to pour??<//text>

<Text>I am not big on McDonald's but when you have kids, grandkids neices and nephews that's always where they want to go.

Anyway first time I ever got a Big Mac it was good I really enjoyed it maybe because I was very hungry I don't,  Will I ever order it again yes I think so.  But I do believe location is a factor and person preparing it makes a difference.👍< /Text>< user_name>

They have a giant tablet they not one Spanish person knows how to use even though they are tapping away on their phones? Using it is simple but take a extreme amount of time to get your order! Guessing all the Spanish talking going on behind the scenes is more important then actually getting any work done! Avoid the stress make your breakfast at home.< /Text>

I went to purchase some Hot Caramel Sundaes. I hadn’t bought some in a years and was shocked at the price. 2.19 fir a Sunday, really! I bought them anyway. They never asked me if I wanted peanuts at any time. So I asked for some and I was told that they ran out of them.

About a week and a half to two weeks later I go back and buy some more. Once more no one asked me if I wanted peanuts. I asked and the girl told me that they had ran out and hadn’t received a shipment for more than a week.

Not only do they never seem to have peanuts, but the Sundae cups were not filled all the way to the top. Only about 2/3 of the way up. An ice cream cone that costs about a buck less has more ice cream, they hardly put any caramel, they had no peanuts, and they charged me 2.19 plus tax for that, really!!!!

What the hell is wrong with McDonald’s? I hardly eat McDonalds. I find their burgers to be and taste very artificial. Poorly made food. None the less every once in a while, every few blue moons, I feel like getting a Big Mac. It seems that every time I go in they are quick at reminding me why I hardly ever go there.<//Text>

There's always something good on the menu at McDonald's. I love the sausage biscuits for breakfast, the Sundaes, McFlurries, cookies or parfaits for dessert, the healthy choices for sandwiches and salads. It remains one of my go-to places when my budget is tight, and time is limited. McDonald's is still a force to be reckoned with after all these years<//Text>

Management here is forcing customers to go to Drive-Thru? The staff is lead to ignore customers? Why? Get rid of the self-checkout, and hire cashier's? This is horrible store policy that leads to slow service, instead of fast food?
If you care about customer experience, then look up Luddites? Only Millennials are fascinated by modern touchscreen. And that, in no way makes up all of society?<//Text>

Finally remodeled, this store is getting better. Needs self-service ordering modules. Plenty of seating. Parking can be tricky in peak hours.< /Text>

<review>Yeah, I was there for a frappé. The representative was near the screens where now we can choose what we want from there. So he helped me out. But when reaching the cashier desk he the same guy took my payment, that situation was little awkward and funny.
Anyway, that order area is reduced because of those screens, and it make you feel like you're in a small place that can also confused because not sure where to choose and pay.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>If I can give this with no star I would. Customer service sucks!!!!!!! It's only once in awhile I go to McDonalds only if my kids wants 2go. The play area is disgusting. The soda station is disgusting the tables and chairs are disgusting even the bathroom is disgusting. Don't even mention the high chair that is the worst. I bought some 20 piece chicken nuggets 3 large french fries almost all the time because that's what my kids want. When I ask for ketchup they only give me 2 ketchup for 3 large fries. Are you kidding me!!! That's not even all. When I went back to the counter to ask for napkins. I was waiting patiently for someone to notice me. There are two or three managers on the line, they look at me and they started talking about something else instead of helping me. Are you kidding me!!! Oh yeah that's not even all. When I got there with my kids. There was a line a long line about 10 customs with 10 different families. Two of the managers have the nerve to tell that cashier to hurry up well that person was the only one taking orders. And most the customers has big orders. While there were two more cash registers not open. Are you kidding me!!!!!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>They have a new system set up which i don't even think they understand. Food took forever waiting at table since their new system says they will bring it to you.... Nothing had to go ask they say they only serve it in the morning. Yet nobody explains that. Food was cold and was not what i ordered. They made a mistake on the order. A shift manager young girl gives me my burger and fries in hand w/out a tray!! Where do these people get their customer service training. Bad service all around. 😒</Review><Resp>None<//Resp><user>118375522296550616199<//user><Rate>1</Rate><Gmap_id>0x80c2972e64eaab3f:0x27c5763dcbdd07f8< /Gmap_id><date>1502675079784</date><user_name>Sandra R.

I don't know what's going on at this McDonald's ,but it takes more that 20min to get a order from the drive thru . It's like they are never ready don't they know we all have to be at work in the mornings and afternoon . Also when there done and I get to work I have the wrong order I mean what is it that their doing?  I've been coming to these McDonald's over 15 years and it's just getting worse.< /review>

<Text>Without fail. Every time I go here, they mess up something on my order. They fix it, yes. But the fact that it happens every time is an issue. The drive through after 8 pm has a problem with getting orders right as more than once they have almost given me someone else's order, and already charged me for it so they have to refund the wrong order and recharge my correct order. One occasion they had given the car in front of me my order and didn't catch it.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2972e64eaab3f:0x27c5763dcbdd07f8<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Drive thru was faster than others and the costumer service was great ... Great smile. It is one of the clraneast mcdonalds that i have visited ... There are new machine also . For those who do not like to stand in line for a long amount of time ...  Also, if im sure there is a playground located at the other side of the entrance so kids would have a enjoyful time as well.<//Text>

Can't say much you know when you get burgers two for $3 you can't expect much the only problem with McDonald's is they charge almost five bucks for an order of fries total rip-off to the hilt that's where they make their money you don't they charge to reasonable prices for the french fries they probably have more business< /Text>

<Review>' WOW'
I  recently had the urge for a Big Mac.  I drove to this location.  Parking was OK.  It was around 2 PM.  I had problems communicating with he cashier.  I ordered 2 Big Mac's no salt.  She repeats back to me OK no sauce.  I repeat no salt and and then I said no sal.  OK OK, she says and repeats back to me 4 Big Macs no sal.  I held up two fingers and repeated back to her 2 Big Mac's no salt.  She repeats back to me holding up 4 fingers saying, four Big Macs no sauce.  Wow.  We finally got that straightened out, however the line behind me had grown and the customers were upset.  Sh rang me up and I was surprised at the cost.  Expensive.

While I waited to the side of the counter I saw such congestion due to the fact that the Self order kiosk was located where the line would start at the counter.  People and kids bumping into each other.  Not a good location for the kiosk, breaks the flow.

Meanwhile as I stood to the side waiting for my order to go, I had observed grouchy stressed customers as they entered, while they ordered and when they received their messed up orders.  Honestly, it was quite a show.  There was bad ju ju in this place.  I stayed close to the door.

I make it a habit to check my order before leaving an establishment.  THIS time I didn't, I wanted to get out and get home.  Upon my arrival I was surprised at the size of the BIG Mac,  they looked like sliders (mini hamburgers), more bread than anything.  For the price they charged I had expected more.</Review></record>

This place just got remodel ! Looks nice and it even has the New Order Kiosk! Sadly the staff at this joint! Is piss poor when it comes to understanding how the order at kiosk and pay system works!
It was explain to me by a MCD Manager that if you place a order on a kiosk all you need is the order receipt walk up to a open register at the counter hand the order receipt the cashiers are to take that order receip take payment and then you wait for the food. This MCD those not respect that! They will ask to go to the back of the line and waith even tho you already follow all steps at the kiosk.... This location needs better training in the phone APP and kiosk procedures.<//Review>

<review>the drive thru is packed and I decide to go in instead. I know they are busy and it might take  some time to get me 3 drinks that I ordered.  which were a caramel frappe, iced tea, and and iced coffee. but as I look around there are 3 employees just standing around... and while waiting 2 customers come in that were in the drive thru. one complaining about the lemonade that the employee claimed there wasn't anymore off and the second customer claiming he never received his credit card back.
Oh and I never got my receipt, instead I got someone else's receipt...
If your going to McDonald's just drive a bit towards the plant. It's just more efficient and they get your order much quicker in comparison to this location.

Oh and my ice black coffee that I ordered is sweet...  really? Is it hard not to put anything on it. I guess I'm just too picky for my BLACK coffee and maybe I wasnt too clear when the cashier asked if I want anything on it and I said no.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Actually this place gets not even one star the info on google maps say their drive thru closes at midnight but I just called a d the woman said their drive thru is closed and everytime I come here it seems as if they always close the restaurant and the drive thru early ownership needs to look into this major issue. To me if the owners suck so do the managers and it always trickles down to the employees since they have no guidance from leadership cause leadership blows tremendously<//Text>< pictures>

-don’t make you feel welcome
-will totally ignore you
-the table service is pointless, they don’t bring your food to you and leave food  on their counter to be cold and not care.</review>

(Translated by Google) The Drive thru is always full, and you are not always lucky to find someone friendly, it is only at certain times !!! ...
In general all the food is good!
In any McDonald's the taste is the same but when you ask for specific things sometimes you get disappointed ... It's okay in the end ...

(Translated by Google) HAIR IN A HAPPY MEAL
ONE POCKET, TWO MANAGERS
THEY IGNORE THEIR CUSTOMERS
AND THEY NEVER GIVEN AN APOLOGY
Everything was fine with this place but this week exactly October 2 I went with my babies to buy some happy boxes, and what I never do is open them and see if everything is fine, because this time I saw it and to my misfortune I found a hair inside the happy meal 😠😠I know the cashier, she grabbed it but I could see what she was holding and I only changed the toy because apart from that I told her that it was for children and she gave me one as a girl and it was That one, the cashier only changed the toy and she was giving it back to me and I told her that I had not seen what it was and that I wanted to change everything not only the toy and I asked her to speak to the manager, I did not look at her. I will speak but I can see her and I yell at her the lady leaned out of the window I told her what had happened and she just turned to see the cashier and she didn't answer me at all, the cashier just turned around and gave me the drinks and I asked her by the name of the manager and she told me Jobana I asked her for her last name and the cashier told me ASK YOURSELF SHE, and the woman began to call her, isolating herself and another appeared and I heard him clearly that he said as a form of angry AND WHAT DO YOU WANT? When she got to the window, she explained what happened and the cashier told her, "She is the one that I told her that she found a hair in her food and I only asked her, have you changed it?" She said yes and he just stared at me as if to say ok, that's it !!! And I asked him for his name too and he told me Gabriel asked him for his surname and he told me that he would not give it to me because it is for their protection and I said to him that Jobana could not come to tell me? And he answered that he did not know, I felt a lot of courage to all this, I spoke English all the time until the end before I left I told Grabriel that he did not want to come and put his face of not knowing anything, that I had heard him asking what I wanted with Gross way, that I also spoke Spanish and I no longer told them anything, I just started to drive IF THEY ARE SO INRRESPONSIBLE FOR NOT FACING THEIR ERRORS AS THEY ARE GOING TO TEACH THEIR WORKERS TO BE THEIR JOB WELL I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CASHIER BUT TWO MANAGERS AND NO ONE RECEIVED AN APOLOGY FOR WHAT HAPPENED NOTHING NOTHING TO THE CONTRARY I IGNOR SUCH JOBANA AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MANAGERS,

(Translated by Google) I did not like what I paid for what I ate, it became expensive and it was expensive and the hamburger not even well presented, a mayonnaise bread a little onion meat I will not go to eat that, with the only thing that if I am satisfied It is with the breakfasts.

(Translated by Google) I came on Wednesday, August 2 at 3pm and ordered two hambugasas with avocado and some chiken nogets. To my surprise, the place is remodeled and has service to the table but it is a bad service. I lacked napkins when they brought my order, then when I took my drink I realized that they did not bring me a straw, and I went for the second time for what I needed, then I realized that I did not see the chiken nogets and I read for the third time, they left the place nice but they have to improve the service

(Translated by Google) The McDonald's have observed that they are always cleaning the tables on the floor, but this restaurant is very dirty tables, food almost spoiled to miss the bad coffee. They should strive more in customer service and cleanliness and improve food.

Los McDonald's he observado que siempre están limpiando las mesas el piso, pero este restaurante están muy sucias las mesas, la comida casi hechada a perder el café mal hecho. Deben esmerarse más en el servicio al cliente y la limpieza y mejorar la comida.< /text>
