<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Hard boba, nasty tea, milk separated from liquid. Idk what's wrong with them, but good lord are they bad. I have no clue what's keeping this place open because it's so god awful. It is a disgrace for Quickly to call themselves a boba store, it's worse than anywhere else I've ever been. I'd euthanize myself before going back here again.

Last coffee stop before heading out of SanFran and I wish I would have known of it sooner. Nice little place to just relax. Not much for scenery because it's by an alley, but great spot to enjoy your coffee and chill.
Will be my spot next time I'm here.<//Text>

<Text>Hmm, what to say. I tried to go to the one in Pleasant Hill but apparently that one was closed so Google needs to update their info. This location does accept paper and plastic so that's a plus. This store however didn't really look cared for. Just kinda looks dirty. The guys working were nice. My order tasted fine, nothing great about it. It came out in a timely manner and that was that.< /Text>< Pics>

Worse experience ever! I was skipped in line. My order was completely wrong and when I asked to fix it they still messed it up. When confronted they just gave me what I asked for but in a smaller size. We asked for the size we want and she just gave us a dollar thinking it will make it up.<//review>

<Text>Easily the cheapest and most authentic boba around. I recommend jasmine milk tea with
lychee jelly. They have many many topping options and a massive menu. They do not serve everything on the menu, however. At nights and weekends the place can be very busy. Service is often very slow. Overall, this is the best boba place in central county if not just for the value.</Text></record>

If you need to get your bubble tea fix, this is the place to go!  Strawberry milk tea with the large tapioca is my go-to drink.  It can have a funky smell every now and again, but the drinks are definitely worth it.  This location also accepts credit cards!  Only one of the few Quicklys in the ara do this.<//Review>

So, I'm pretty sure the "Quickly" for its name can be applied to the drinks they make, but definitely not for the food. i went there for an hour lunch break; big mistake! It took 30 minutes for the food I ordered (a fairly simple noodle bowl) to be be made. Even then, the food was poorly made. The chicken was slimy and the soup broth was really generic. Not very flavorful.

After eating what I could to make it back to work on time, I started feeling sick an hour later. My stomach clearly didn't like the food.

Go there for your drinks, sure, but definitely not for the food!</Review>

The wait here can be ridiculous. If you're standing in line behind 4 people, you can expect at least two people to order an Oreo shake, which takes the cashier a few minutes to prep. I've waited upwards of 20 minutes to get my order in on a basic Jasmine Milk Tea.

This is a decent place for a no-frills, cheap milk tea. If the line is too long or you're willing to spend a little more, try Boba Loca on the other side of the plaza, or Sharetea in Todos Los Santos. Chances are driving there will be faster than waiting in line here for your order.</text>

I went to this location when it opened because it accepted cards, which the one by DVC did not.

Great nature walking near Los Angeles. Feels very secluded and has great views! Great place to get away from the city without having to go to far.<//Review>

At the beginning it doesn’t seem a hike at all, considering that you have to drive 6 miles to the top of the hill. The ocean is visible immediately. Basically you go down first as much as you want and the hike starts at the end when you have to get back! Gorgeous view of Santa Monica and Malibu.

Enjoy< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Local hiking/running trail off the beaten path. It’s a family-friendly hike and leashed dogs are allowed. Take the winding roads of Topanga Canyon to get up to the trailhead. It’s a short walk to a fork in the road. If you turn left, you’ll head up 0.4 miles to a point where you can see the Santa Monica Pier. There’s one bench and a stone “labyrinth” which is fun to circle around in. If you take a right and keep following the road right, there’s a ~1.7 mile trail that leads to an end where there’s a smaller stone “labyrinth” and a view of the Malibu Pier. If you want to add onto the hike, you could also veer towards the water tank, which is a separate trail.

Parking is free but be sure to park on the pavement. You’ll definitely need your parallel parking skills to be on point, or just just keep going down the road to find a spot. There’s no bathrooms or water fountains so bring plenty of water! The trail is very exposed with minimal shade from the trees. There’s a slight gradient uphill when you turn left, and it’s a slight gradient downhill when you turn right. Overall it’s a fun, free way to get some steps in. Enjoy the fresh air and ocean breeze!< /Text>< Pictures>

This trail was nice. I really enjoyed it the most because there was almost no one there especially no children. There isn't bee much shade so if you're looking for a fresh hike this is not it.</review>

< Review>
Tuna Canyon Trailhead is a beautiful hiking trail located between the mountain ranges between Malibu and Topanga. The entrance is slightly hidden, but the trail itself offers some stunning views from the city of LA to the valleys and beaches of Malibu. The trail is quite wide and is really more of a hilly walk than a rigorous hike. Overall, I had a wonderful experience here, and hope to come back soon for some of the most romantic viewpoints in the greater Los Angeles area!< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>As a hiker I don’t say this lightly that the Tuna Canyon Trail has the most spectacular and stunning view. TC Park has 1,255-acre in the western Santa Monica Mountains above PCH in Malibu parallels more than two miles of the Pacific Ocean, and provides dramatic, 360-degree views of the San Gabriel mountains to the Santa Monica Bay. Furthermore, it links over 18,000 acres of contiguous protected open space from Topanga State Park west to Las Flores Canyon. We drove up to the trail head from PCH via narrow Tuna Canyon road. There’s only dirt parking near and/or at the trail head. The entrance to the trail is somewhat hidden and the only landmark is that huge rusty white painted guard metal gate entrance. The hike is about 2 to 5.1 miles (out and back) with elevation change of 900 to 1,500 ft. The trail head has two main
view points: the West vp (Hearst Tank) and the East vp (Big Rock Lateral). Both view points are not interconnected albeit offer a magnificent 360 degrees view of the park. The park is located in Topanga Canyon and it’s dog and bike friendly. The trails were flat and wide with few rocky sections. It took us approximately 2 hrs and 45 minutes to complete both trail sections. We like that this trails are not as crowded and no human traffic. We were breathless when there were literally an ocean of clouds like cotton candy blanketing the pacific ocean, Santa Monica Bay and Malibu. Overall, I highly recommend this trail. A perfect hiking spot for beginners or experienced hiker.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2a1aedb74078f:0x8f883fb02c31c746<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

All your collector card game needs, great organization of events, usually a full house on draft nights.  Lots of fun, and very welcoming staff / crowd.< /review>

I have bought cards from Channel Fireball a few times. Shipping is a bit expensive to my country but the experience was pretty good.
I bought cards for one of my friends as well, CB couldn't find all the cards we ordered. They gave us an options to resolve it, cashback, alternative card quality, my friend wasn't disappointment and I got my money back from him.
They never sent me scratched cards as near mint. Highly recommend.
They have free podcasts for magic the gathering as well called limited resources. Thanks guys!< /review>

Totally inappropriate, completely unprofessional.

If you feel like NOT getting hit in the face with insulting commentary and low ball or no ball offers then I suggest shopping with someone else.

Don’t believe the buy list, these guys just want to waste your time and rip you off.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I was looking to sell the remains of my older Magic the Gathering collection. Earlier in the day I had visited a local shop and then went to ChannelFireball.  The professional staff worked as a team to appraise my older magic cards and wound up giving me more than twice the offer the earlier store had!  Thank you to your team and purchasing process.  I highly recommend selling to this store!< /text><name>Redbeard's Fireworks Showcase</name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><user>115860037507899886967</user></record></dataset><record>

Awesome game store full of a bunch of nice people. A fun, competitive environment that retains a high level of play without being rude or cutthroat. Highly recommend as a place to play games. The game selection is fairly small, but it's minor compared to the event atmosphere.</review>

The place is designed with being able to play card games in mind. Theres a toooon of tables. More than I've ever seen at any non tour atmosphere and it's amazing. They have snacks, packs, singles, matts etc. They have a bit of everything you will need. Only reason it's not a 5 star is they only support standard in store. The single they have are for standard, the format, packs etc are all for standard. They of course have lands, Nicol bolas and a few other high end non standard cards. But they have the real estate to support more than just standard.</review>

Always been a a fair place to me, pricing is steep compared to almost anywhere else but that means they almost always have cards in stock that you're looking for.</Text>

This is the place to go for your MTG fix. World renowned. If you want to get better at the game, this is the place to go to play some of the game's most competitive players. This is a game center. What makes this place five stars, is the friendly and open environment. You come to play the game, but you leave with a friend.<//Review>

Had a nice discussion with an employee over a game of magic today. I'm very glad to hear they're trying to make their store more noob safe and family-friendly. I know sometimes it's hard to accept new players & sometimes it's really, really, hard to accept Munchkins. However, if we don't help new gamers become better players, you run out of challenges pretty fast.
I don't know about you, but I like playing new people.< /Text>

Provided inaccurate instructions to order delisted products while scans were taken, then sold the requested products to someone else after I followed the provided instructions to the letter. A dishonest company; buy your Magic: The Gathering products elsewhere.< /review>

THE premier game center for Magic: the Gathering. daily tournaments draw often highly skilled players, especially on Fridays for FNM and for the store's periodic 1K/4K and other major events. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It's a great place to meet up with friends, to come to make friends, to pop in for picking up a few singles or a few boxes, or for hanging out all evening.</Review>

Felt immediately at home as a foreign magic player in the bay area. People are very friendly, there's constantly something going on and the selection of cards is very broad. Keep in mind: there's no Wi-Fi for the customers and the card prices tend to be higher than in Europe. Still it was a very pleasant visit and I regret that I didn't have time to visit again during my stay in California.< /Text>

Just as expected. Screens for match info, a long counter for trades/purchases.

Feature match area! And a bunch of tables with little numbers for matches.

Bathrooms and a fridge of refreshments. 10/10 will FNM again.<//Text>

For a name so large, I really expected more. I understand that they're a large online retailer, but I expected them to have a lot more on hand. Rating because of lack of available singles, store staff was friendly and we're sad to hear that they would be unable to provide me the singles I was looking for. I stopped in on my way home to Canada and sadly I won't be back.<//Text>

From a purely aesthetic standpoint, the game center isn't much. It's a warehouse-y space located in a odd corner near the San Jose Airport; the decor and amenities are worn but well-kept. What really makes this place shine is the great staff and the community. Especially if you're a Magic: The Gathering fan this is place to be for events, trading, and collecting. Tons of players flock here for Friday drafts, release events, and just to hang out. The staff is super friendly and they have great MTG judge support. Sometimes a taco stand will show up (appropriately named "Tapped Out Tacos") to provide burritos and soda. Couldn't really ask for much more from a game store.< /Text>

<Text>If you're looking for a place to play card games in the South Bay, Channel Fireball Game Center is definitely the go-to place especially for Magic.  All of the events held by Channel are cheap and worthwhile with lots of space for the many players on any day of the week.  The staff are nice and friendly and they have an amazing judge support team happy to help players.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Too crowded, no options for spectating, no space for anything but event.

Mixed crowd, mixed level of ability and experience, very loud.

Issues with smokers outside sharing their cancer. Sometimes has food at events. Lines for bathrooms. Hard to get to, limited parking.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>This is THE place to play Magic: the Gathering on the West coast. It's essentially the Star City Games of the West. The place isn't that big and it gets packed to the gills on Friday, so come early for FNM. They have drafts and events every day of the week, and there's always something going on here. The players are fairly competitive, and you'll even find some pro players here once in a while.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>I usually buy their product online since im out of state. When i came to visit my family in the bay area i decide to stop by the store to huy some boxes and singles.  I asked one of their store clerks if they have any boxes in stock and he just ignored me, when i asked for help with some singles he look irrate.  I asked for the pricing on some singles and he was upset that i asked.  I know i was in a short and white t shirt, but i just got off my flight and had lunch.  I left upset and went to another store to to buy products.  Im just upset that one of your employees judge me on how i looked. He probably had a bad day but if he did he shouldnt take it out on customers</review>< Resp>

It's a well known gaming store and has lots of options for Magic the Gathering, including Friday night drafts and prerelease events for every prerelease. Their prize structure is also always reasonable. Highly recommended.</review>

I've gone there many times for magic ever since I stopped going to Santa Cruz to play tournaments and there are really nice people

Ps all the people are very friendly and will help you with pretty much everything and the people who go there to play magic are mostly nice people</review>

Always been a a fair place to me, pricing is steep compared to almost anywhere else but that means they almost always have cards in stock that you're looking for.<//text>

Cards, supplies, friendly staff, and events. Boosters are less than msrp! Can get pretty crowded and stuffy at peak release times. Lots of tables to play at but table clothes are kind of dirty. All in all our favorite place to get cards and play at prereleases.</review>< Resp>

When I called on a Monday morning they were able to get me in for an oil change balance rotate tires and were very professional and friendly. From the first time I took my car they have always given me a discount on a service. They are great.</Review>

Staff were knowledgeable regarding my tire and brake concerns. They were able to quickly repair the vehicle and worked around my schedule. Staff were friendly and professional. Will refer to friends and family as needed.</Text>

<review>Great customer service, and no pressure what do ever, for me when it comes to auto shops, “So” is the worst to hear a mechanic say...but when they did here I was able to still feel free about my decision...
Thanks again to the mechanics for fixing my flat!<//review>< name>

Now I want to follow up on my car to make sure all the fluids where filled properly, and to check the air filter to see if it was replaced,along with the wipers. I know Walmart’s full service does it all, and it’s a bit cheaper.< /text>< pictures>

Within a one week period, I took a 2016 Suburban and a 2013 Subaru to have an oils change. I had a $20 off coupon for both. They charged me $55 per the suburban with its v8 fully synthetic oil. Then they charge me $85 for the 4 cylinder Subaru. When I asked them why, they said that the 2016 required dextrose in the oil which made the oil cheaper. That makes no sence. The suburban required twice as much oil. TRY GREGS DOWN THE STREET, you will be happier. They are fair, consistent and honest.< /Text>

TF Tire is the best place to get tires and they also do oil changes. They save me time and money because I only have to go to one place.</review>

Unprofessional experience, braider was eating while braiding my hair and chewing in my ear. I was so annoyed. Texting on her phone ,stopping to eat. Hair was done horribly, she told me one price over the phone when I got there it was much more....

Never again.< /Text>

Paid and asked for a specific style and after repeating myself it was still done they way the braided wanted to do it.

Big guards with small amount of stretched hair.

Arguing, cussing & x-rated videos and/or television ALWAYS playing, even when children are present.</review>

Twisted me up pretty quick and neat. Got mine done by Mareatha. Very polite and friendly. Didn’t pull my hair all ridiculously hard. Very nice touch. I like the outcome but the results are usually based off the reactions you get. I stepped out the shop and literally caught a few new friends! So you be the judge!<//Text>

<review>It was the best my Braider was Ms. Erica very patient and professional.  She called the day before to confirm my appointment also she was on time. She braided my hair beautifully. The shop owner greeted me with a wonderful smile. I was concerned about getting hungry. There were snacks and they were free . It was a comfortable environment. Ms. Erica did a excellent job on my hair. It was my first time there but not my last. Thanks to the staff at Braids your way.😎<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I had my own hair done in individual braids. Ms. Maretha (owner) was friendly, polite, timely, and professional. She started working on my hair as soon as I got there. She braided my hair beautifully. I have received nothing but complements for my braids. It was my first time there and will definitely come back.</review>

Worst customer service experience. If I could give a negative Star I would. Clearly not intrested in New clients or perspective new ones. Won't ever do business here, and wouldn't recommend to anyone who appreciates good customer service. Highly disappointed.<//review>

<text>I won’t give this salon one star because I know there are a couple of good hairstylists there.

Extremely unprofessional. I was a walk in, neither of them wanted  to do my hair and even said so... rudeness at its finest. If they didn’t want to except me as a walk in they should have said so when I called. I wouldn’t even give them one star. I’m embarrassed for them. Didn’t get my hair done I walked out and went somewhere else I couldn’t take the unprofessionalism anymore. Very sad!< /review>

Love this place....I will never go anywhere else to get my hair braided...even though I couldn't get it braided today due to it being short, I will most definitely be back in 2 months. I appreciate her honesty to the fullest...< /review>

Edit: 4/29
I got my hair done on 4/12, had to take out the style due to allergic reaction to how hard they parted my hair, making my scalp sensitive to the products on 4/15.

Its 4/29 and I have 6 times over the course of two weeks for the shop owner and no responds! I am very sad because I wanted to work something out!

I went in for some medium box braids but got jumbo ones. I didn't mind since I loved the look in the end! But sadly, within 34 or so hours, my partings felt so tender and tight. I am not tender headed at so I thought it was weird, however when I looked in the mirror, I had red spots that looked like rashes! I am not sure if it was due to the products used or it was because of how tight the braids were but I am sad! I used my hard earned coin to get braids for the first time and now I am left with allergic reaction and no cute braids.

I wish I could contact the owner of the salon to discuss what we can do because I want to give this salon another chance and get the correct style I want too.<//Text>

<Text>These ladies are superb.  I called the same day because person who was to do my hair flaked on me.  They were able to schedule me that afternoon. From the phone call with Shay all the way to entering the shop was all a pleasant experience.  My stylist was Mareatha.  She asked how I wanted my hair, I showed her a picture and she did her thing from there.

Braids Your Way is definitely the ONLY place I will ever come to get my hair done!!!!!  In my opinion 5 stars are not enough.

See you ladies soon.

<Review>I've been going to get my braids done there for over ten year's
and im so pleased with the love and care I receive there..I feel at home among friends..the owner treat your hair like its her own..im a braider and was doing my own hair for years..tore my edges out..now Im getting quality  care done to my hair..looking fly when I leave with the knowledge of knowing how to take care of my own hair now my edges are back and my hair is so long..the owner made sure I had refreshments when I go in too early to eat..I wont allow anyone else to do my hair..its hard to find a place where you get hair your hair done and feel relaxed knowing your money is being well spent..the prices are affordable and the braids last..plus they will retouch my braids so I'm not out of a lot of money..whereas I use to pay full price to get my braids done over
so if you want to go to a place and you're on a budget and need your braids to last??? try braids your way< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The check-in app seems pretty pointless. I checked in 21 minutes early. I arrived at about 19 minutes. My name was at the top of the screen so I thought I'd be next, especially since I was right at the check in time. 2 girls were working, one cutting hair and the other sweeping. One customer was waiting. The sweeper asked if I checked in, after I said yes and told her my name she said it would be 10 to 15 minutes. She went back to sweeping for another minute or two then called the other guy, up. Again, what's the point of the app?? This has happened to me a couple times before.  I only wish great clips had some competition in my area. Maybe one of these days.< /review>

I love the way Kelsey cuts my hair . I don't trust anybody else.I have a natural curl to it and every time I go to somebody else ,they just cut the curl right out of my hair. She's friendly and  knowledgeable on all products. I know you can't please everyone, but thank you for pleasing me Thank you Kelsey.</Text>

We always have Kelsey cut our hair! She’s been doing it for years now and she does a great job! Even when it is busy she always takes her time and makes sure that it’s done right. My son has wavy hair and it has to be cut just right and she makes sure of it. Thanks!!</text>

<review>Terrible experience there. Got my hair cut from Kelsey. Just wanted a straight cut to the back. She insisted she could cut straight hair and that it was no problem. She cut my hair all fast even though there wasn't a soul in the salon. She didn't even want to section my hair! she was just going to pull it all back and cut straight across without any guideline. Like some kid cutting barbies hair. Even pros cutting for years use guidelines to get precise cuts. She started going at my hair so sloppy. I had bumps throughout the top of my head that she didn't brush through all the way while she was cutting. I told her at the end it wasn't straight or even when she was done and another associate even checked it saying it was. Dont trust her judgement with blue hair! They insisted it was straight but I could feel my head so unbalanced, I go home straighten it to double check. Its completely crooked and slanting up towards one side and my sides are two different lengths.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1572481094492, 'text': "We're sorry to hear this was your experience.

If at all I wanted a trim if anything but no she said for me to come when it's closer to the style I want.

These ladies here are awesome and are like friends to me at this point.  I love to come here.  Using the online check in saves me a lot of time.  I do appreciate when they take their time and don't rush my haircut.  I never go anywhere else.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Perfect hair cut the way I want it: 3 on the sides, finger thick on the top, and squared at the back. I get my haircut twice a year and it's an overgrown mop when I come in, and I feel like I've lost 20 pounds after a nicely cut head. BTW, you will get the most out of your time there if you download the Great Clips app, which will allow you to check in online, which can minimize your wait time. I've used it to see what the wait times are at my local Great Clips shops and if this one is crowded, I peer into the wait times at the other nearby shop on Newport Road. I hate having to sit for a haircut, and the app helps me get in and out in no time flat.< /Text><time>1478020087363< /time></record>

Even after washing and styling it myself at home, I still love it.  Great job Breyanne! Thanks for giving me a great cut.   ~Lisa</Text>< GmapID>

Kelly's great!  Moved recently from the Bay Area and always dread finding a new beautician, but was pleasantly surprised.  I usually avoid walk-in places, but a friend in Menifee recommended Kelly at Great Clips, so my husband and I decided to try it.  We both have curly hair and mine is also fine and thin, so a bad cut takes forever to grow out.  Kelly did a great job for both of us!  Recommend downloading the app and checking in or check in on the web to avoid a wait.</text>

I got a haircut here last week and it was exactly how I wanted it, I will say you should definitely make an appointment though because they get a lot of business and are pretty slammed on weekends especially and I mean they have online check in so no worries just take the extra 2 mins online to save an hour in the store! I am happy with my haircut and will be back soon, the other haircuts places in the area charge 20$ and that's without a tip so the choice is yours!<//Text>

Andouille sausage and pulled pork sandwich, and ribs are delicious.  They pair well with the beers inside the Novo Brazil brewery.</Review>

Just checking for a Cajun food spot. The food looks great. Just wondering if you offer crawfish or a crab boil?I was reading a review about Cajun food they say "crab hut" was #1 in San Diego?! I plan on visiting Smitty's soon.< /Review>

< Review>
The woman at the front desk who took my order was very rude and not very attentive.  She still charged me for sodas that I several times asked her not to charge me and did not want the  2 sodas, sodas were $2.00 each. She constantly ignored me and was still talking to another person and avoided me until I asked for help; very rude with an attitude!!! She needs training in Customer Service.  Smitty was very nice though and was very helpful with my order.  Food was very good, especially the Collard Greens. Won't go back there due to the poor service and attitude of that person.
Gujuan, I'm still waiting on the credit for the two sodas that I was charged for that you promised that you would.  Let me see if you stand by your word. Thank you</Review>

Smitty's is super good. The ribs, chicken and sides are super high quality. Its hard to say what I liked best in the combo plate. Everything is just so good. If you like really good BBQ look no further. Best in SD!< /review>

We dropped in Smitty's for some to-go benefits on our means to Hess. We had actually both avoided lunch that day, so we were starving when the great girl at the register asked us what appeared excellent.\"Everything!\" wasn't the ideal response, though it was the fact. She did inform us that the sections were large, yet provided our famished state, we downplayed it.I purchased the combination plate (chicken and ribs, with sides of macaroni as well as collard greens) and also my partner opted for the Friday night unique, the deep-fried catfish, which was served with fries. Both meals included soft drinks; we took the cans yet hung on to them as we were headed to Hess for beer.My hubby's exclamation - after completing his dish - regarding amounts up our response to the food. \"That man knows how to cook!\" The chicken was succulent and also great smoky and also had not been drenched in sauce. The ribs were weighty and also tender. The eco-friendlies were breaking with flavor, and also the mac was luscious and also dental filling. My partner said the catfish was the finest he's ever had, which's claiming a great deal (he's a catfish connoisseur, haha). He finished his dish and after that helped me brighten off the hen and also ribs (they aren't joking when they say it's a lots of food). They do have some outdoor seating at the coffee shop that they make use of as a storefront, but its distance to Hess suggests we'll likely never ever sit tight to eat.But we most definitely will go back, and also soon!</Text>

I see it’s got pretty good reviews and I really wanted to like this parking lot food pop-canopy festival style place BUT, Smitty was drunk from the brewery he’s setup outside next too.  Chicken and ribs was cold and undercook.  Jambalaya wasn’t that good; rice was mushy.  I asked for green beans several times and a side of jambalaya, Smitty said he would charge me full price meal for a side of jambalaya! even though I already got the combo.  So I spent 30$! Phill BBQ is way better for the same price! Plus you get a better dinning experience at Phil’s.  The person ahead of me paid with a 100$ bill which Smitty has to go inside brewery to get change but when he gave me change his money pouch was overfilling with all sorts of bills more than enough change!?< /review>

Ribs werent consistent, some of them would fall off the bone, some would be hard meat. The staff was rude. I was super hungry and wanted to get seconds (i had one small rib on my plate), the serving lady straight up told me no, come get food later and told me to wait 20 minutes. What kind of catering is this? Let the guest eat whatever they want. It's not like the food is running out. Can you not calculate how much food people will eat? Snarky attitude to the guests for catering that was already paid for. Poor service and left a sour taste in my mouth. At the end of the party there was 2 trays of ribs left! What was this lady holding out on the guest for? Way to make hungry people wait for no reason. By the end of the party, the catering company also forgot to put out the cajun/shrimp rice, how is that possible? I will say that the Mac and cheese has a lot of cheese. All the other sides are not worth the stomach space. Catering is NOT professional. Southern food without the southern hospitality.< /text>< resp>

<text>The Redwood shop is your classic barber shop. Jason hooks it up with a clean, professional cut every time. I live out of town but I always time my haircuts around when I’m back in Folsom because no one does it like him. Super convenient to be able to reserve spots through their website. If you live in the area and need a great cut, this is the place to go.</text>< Pictures>

One of the best haircuts ever. Jason knew what I wanted, put his clean style to match my requests, and provided one of the cleanest fades I’ve ever received. I have thick hair with greys so my hair can be tricky, but he blended the fade effortlessly. Straight lines where it needed to be. Highly recommend him and this shop as they were clean and professional. (Mid-skin drop fade, razor hard line + lineup, comb-over on top).< /text>

<Text>The struggle of finding a suitable barber after moving to a new city has alas ended for me. I moved to Folsom a couple months back and have since hopped around a few different shops, but never been fully satisfied. I happened upon this place and scheduled with Jason, and was super impressed. Not only was he a pleasure to talk to while on the chair, but he was super informative about the style of cut I wanted and why I may not have had success with it in the past, and how he was going to fix those problems. He did just that and gave me the exact style I had in mind.

Definitely try this place out. I presume all of the other barbers here are great too, but I highly recommend Jason based on my personal experience!

(As a side note, really appreciate the "LGBTQ Friendly" tag on their Google listing. Don't see that much in these parts).<//Text>< UserId.>

<Review>Just recently moved to the area. Found this barbershop online, seen all the great reviews and they are all absolutely true. I would go as far as to say this is the most welcoming and chill barbershop I've ever been to. Ricky did a great job on my hair and these guys are just all around awesome. I will 100 percent be going back.< /Review>< name>

I was visiting Folsom and took a chance here for my first post-Covid haircut and beard trim. Glad I did. Jason was great -- really took some shaving concerns seriously, gave me good professional feedback on how to style this old man's hair -- and was a totally good guy. Highly recommend.<//review>

If your looking for an amazing barber book with Ricky at Redwood immediately.  This place is great. Very professional, very clean and before you even sit in the chair you can feel the creativity and care in the atmosphere. Ricky and Sutherland are great guys who will have you leaving slick.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I’ve been getting my haircut from Jason since 2014. He is an outstanding barber. I’ve had many different style cuts from him and he is personable, transparent, and makes sure that you are satisfied.

I used to go to Luckys. The environment there is overall unprofessional, I only went there because Jason used to work there. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND REDWOOD BARBER SHOP! It is a clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing barber shop paired with talented and considerate barbers.

If you want an experience where the barbers genuinely want to give you what YOU WANT. (Or help guide you to an ideal cut) Then give Redwood Barber shop a chance. I guarantee it will be worth it. The price is slightly higher compared to other shops like Supercuts, great clips, spots clips, etc. but honestly you pay for the expertise. These barbers are EXTREMELY TALENTED & REALLY CARE about your experience. Get your next hair cut here!</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Sutherland has been cutting my hair since 2019 and I’ve never had a less-than-perfect haircut since. Redwood is hands down the best barbershop in Folsom. Welcoming (and super talented) barbers, family friendly, and a really great ambiance. This will be the most popular barbershop in Folsom soon!<//review>

I get mine every two weeks. He takes pride in the great fades he makes and takes his time with each session. I tend to be picky and will speak up if I want something extra tight or a little higher, but he’s got it down so well that he’s become my go-to barber. The new shop he has is great! Everything you expect from a barbershop in a great atmosphere. Thanks Sutherland!<//review>< pics>

<text>Redwood is a great barbershop! Sutherland produces professional cuts that are exactly what you want. Jason is just as good! Every barber that works there is top quality. No matter who you have cut your hair you will always get a professional cut. Redwood has great vibes and style throughout the barbershop and has eye turning redwood countertops which makes this barbershop unique. Not only does the place look good you’ll come out looking good with a fresh haircut as well.<//text></record>

Had a buddy that got his hair cut here and recommended it.  I thought I would give it a shot for a walk-in.  I loved the vibe of being greeted right away (a super overlooked element for Barbershops), and was pleasantly surprised to see they had time for a walk-in. Love that it was quick without being rushed at all, very professional, and incredibly clean.  I've found my spot, and highly recommend checking this place out!</Review>

This barber experience is by far the best.  Each barber here has a unique look and style for hair and each are professional and detailed in their work.  You won't find a better place for a haircut / beard trim.< /review>

<Text>I was getting some work done at Les Schwab, and needed a haircut.  Happened upon this great, friendly, affordable barber shop. The guys inside are very friendly, and to add to that they give a great haircut.  I would highly recommend Redwood barbershop.  Walk in or make an appointment.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The haircuts.... the nicest haircuts you can ever ask for. Clean fades and old school razor shaves. Feel like a new person everytime I walk out of there! Also, great with kids! Lifelong customer here.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Everyone in the shop is friendly, they give great haircuts, they’ll line you up perfectly and additional to that the shop itself is sick. This is for sure THE BEST barbershop in Sac. I would most definitely recommend this barbershop to my friends.</review>

< review>
The Scorpion like stares my girlfriend and I received while standing at the front glass door deciding whether to go in felt like a forward back forward harpoon slung at me and clamping in accompanied with a loud and monsterous voice telling me to ;
"GET OVER HERE! "
If it weren't for my quick wit and narrow escape that followed by a shrug to my girlfriend and turning around I sincerely doubt that I would be with enough life in me to write this review now.

I'm not saying the intimidating stereotypical staff that lived up to their first name ; intimidating.  We're planning on chopping up and serving my girlfriend and I but I will bet a buck that I'd leave full of bochalisism and regret on my way to wish I trusted my gut instead of tearing it up.

I have no idea how the food tastes past intimidating and fierce.   That's the truth and that's what I would want my girlfriend or sister to read if she happend to want a review of it before choosing to pop on in.</review>

Destiny was the service rep that came out and she couldn’t have been nicer but more importantly she gave me a detailed update on what she found and what she used for treatment as well. She was super thorough and made a lasting impression. I just recently switched from another company to this one and am certainly happy with the switch.<//review>

I changed companies  after 20 yrs of using another service because when talking with Trevor, the regional manager, he was passionate about what they do for their clients.  He explained how his product was environmentally safe. The guys Brian and Dean, that came to  service were extremely polite. I would highly recommend them.</Review>

<time>1625250312125< /time><text>The first young man that showed at my door step was very respectful as professional.  He had a kind personality.

The second young man verified my information and went over the paperwork.  He arrived that day to complete the services, but unfortunately I had stated cement work in my patio, so he set it up for the following week.

Patrick showed up this morning and was great and professional.   He explained everything he was going to do, and and was super great with my dogs.

Keep it up Aptive!< /text>< user>

Have been using Aptive for half a year and am very happy with their services. Their staff are always prompt and polite and the coverage from their maintenance plan is working wonders around the outside of the house.  Would recommend!< /Review>

I use them on quarterly basis and they come out in between free of charge if you see bugs. Today they came out because of ants! Very quick to come out when I called and so far so good with the ants! They are great!< /text>

These folks are the best!!!! They check-in before they begin and get any information about the pests that we've seen since they were last here. They got rid of wasp nests and ants before it became a problem. The even took a look at my outdoor plants that had some bug nibbles and gave some advice. They are always professional, friendly, timely and thorough! Every single employee that I have encountered, in the year and a half that we have used their service, has been just as nice and professional as can be. We are so happy we signed up. We have NO BUGS in the house anymore AT ALL. Even outdoor, on our patio and backyard, we have seen NO WASPS this year and very very few other bugs!!!

Excellent service as always. Because of very hot weather we have had ants outside after treatment a month ago. We called and they immediately came out next day to retreat outside. Thank you.<//Review>

The service gentleman was extremely nice and helpful. I was a bit disappointed that the rep who scheduled the appointment failed to tell me we needed to be prepared to be out of the home for 2 after spraying inside. I was very clear we have a flea infestation and needed to get the interior sprayed. They were only able to spray outside and I have to reschedule the inside for another day.<//review>

<Review>Victor Sandoval came over to treat those pests noted above. We were very pleased with his professional and thorough inspection and service. He took time to explain to us exactly what he would be doing and answered all our questions.  We would like to request him permanently to treat our home in the future. He was very patient, friendly, and outgoing. He made us feel comfortable and put us at ease having him at our home.< /Review><user>115369628077003907098</user><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Both Johnny, the sales rep, and Ethan, the tech, were honest, courteous, professional and very informative. Ethan showed up on time and was thorough when treating the outside of our home. I would recommend this company for pest control.< /Text>

<review>Today was first time and day of treatment we probably won’t see results till in a couple of weeks other than that Adrian and his Guy were really professional and looked like they knew what they were doing. They were really polite and even gave us some tips and thing we could do to help with bugs.< /review>< pictures>

Arrived right when they said they would. Courtesy call when they were about 15 min away. Brad was a uch a respectful technician. He took care of everything. I mentioned something about rats and he took initiative to check it out and set some traps. Communicated what he found clearly. Was personable, professional and quick. The product they use is safe for animals and kids. I felt safe and confident sending them out to the yard after 30 min.</text>

<name>Peter Veenhuyzen<//name><time>1622644805583<//time><rate>5< /rate><Review>Very cordial sales representatives “Lucas” and “James” approached us at our house. Politely offered to explain Aptive Environmental pest control services.  Liked the Chrysanthemum based product compatible with having pets.  A day or so later, had a question upon reading the contract. Called in and spoke with “Rachel” who was very well in formed and friendly. Straightened out my misunderstanding in a professional, diplomatic, cordial manner.
Crew lead “Alonso” came to our house to perform the first treatment today, and was very knowledgeable and polite. Explained the process again, which was appreciated, since it’s a lot to take in at first.  Answered my questions knowledgeably and politely. Stressed “customer service” was first and foremost, and encouraged me to call if any further questions arise.
My general impression is “Aptive Environmental” is a top tier company in it’s field, taking cues from a “Best Practices” Company business model.
Anticipating a great professional relationship going forward!

I had a great experience from having a professional consultation with the route manager, Francisco S., to the initial service with Jesus R.V. and his team. The whole experience was prompt and thorough.  They were detailed in moving items to make sure that the perimeter was sprayed correctly. I also really enjoyed seeing one of the professionals pick up my son’s outdoor toys to make sure to clear of any spiderwebs.  I’m so happy that Francisco came to my door to offer this service at a great price.  Furthermore, I enjoyed the fact that Aptive uses natural repellents that will not harm my toddler.<//Text>

< Review>
The two gentlemen that's showed up for the service were very nice very accommodating the conversations on the phone prior to that were poor at best. I got notification of two days of service one on Monday 1 on Tuesday, I had requested a morning 8 to 12 when I contacted aptiv regarding the email I got on Monday saying my service was going to be on Tuesday I was told that it was anytime on Monday. That was incorrect I had to have morning. I was given three phone numbers one was disconnected, and one was a Spam call which I do not answer. I called the number back and I did get aptiv I got such different information I was ready to cancel. I don't think corporate knows what they're doing. Whoever is doing the scheduling needs to go by ZIP code don't send the guys from one ZIP code halfway across the country to another zip code it's wasting time and gas. I got lucky this time the guys were just down the street and showed up within 2 minutes but their next call was down in San Clemente that's an hour drive and then back up to Irvine, that's an hour drive back you need to make your appointments with a local person. Hope this doesn't happen again.<//Review>

Aptiva was extremely professional and helpful. Bryce came out first and explained all their services, contracts and pricing. He discounted services to help us get everything we need.
Today, Destiny came out to apply the sprays and prep our property. She worked so hard on this 100 degree hot day and cleared any old webs as well as spraying inside, outside and in our grandchildren’s wooden fort and jungle gym!  She was extremely professional and explained exactly what she was going to do and more. Destiny was a total pleasure and we all loved her!  She’s a tiny little dynamo with a great laugh and personality. We’re so glad our neighbor suggested we give Aptiva a go!  I’m sure our pesky spiders and other creepy crawlies have met their match and won’t be bothering us any longer!  Thank you Aptiva, Bryce & Destiny.</review>

They treated upstairs bathroom sink for tiny ants and for spiders around the perimeter of the house.  They worked very quickly completing job in less than 10 mins.< /Review>

<Text>The folks at Aptive have been terrific.  They check in periodically to see how the service is doing.  A courtesy call is provided prior to arrival so there are no surprises.  We have been customers for about two years - great service, excellent results, and no issues.< /Text>< date>

<Text>Aptive has been doing pest control for us for the past two years. They come quarterly. Last week we noticed a couple of roaches in the backyard - ahead of our quarterly spray. I called, and they came right away to do a free re-spray.  All their personnel have been courteous and friendly.  We are now free of bugs and ants year-round. We highly recommend Aptive.</Text></record></dataset><record>

We just got done with our initial visit with Matthew and David. They sprayed around the house and removed all wasp nests and cobwebs as well. At our request they also sprayed inside where we were having issues with ants. I don't know if it's working but both Matthew and David were super informative and respectful. They even asked if we wanted them to wear shoe covers before coming in which was really nice. They were able to answer every question I had as well.

Crossing my fingers that the rest of the treatments will help with our ant problem!< /review>

I am a returning customer and was so happy to revisit with Jonathan who explained all the good reasons that Aptive is safe for our pets. The team was scheduled to visit right away, and Michelle Rodriguez gave the best service! They were very professional and friendly and took care of everything promptly and safely.< /Review>

<text>An aptive rep came to my door and was really nice at first but he was really pushing me to commit to a one year service and I said I wasn’t going to sign anything without reviewing the cost with my husband. I said my husband wouldn’t be home that night and he said he would be happy to come in the morning. He came back that same night and seemed upset when my husband wasn’t home even thought I told him he wouldn’t be and didn’t come the next day as he said. He wouldn’t give me a business card when I asked or any way to contact him when I was ready to purchase.

I saw the reviews were good for the company so I called for a quote. They sales rep read off a script and I asked if I could have a quote emailed and he said sure but what would it take for you to sign up now on the phone. I said I wasn’t willing to sign up for what is now a 2 year commitment on the phone without having reviewed a quote and taking to my husband and he said ok I’ll email it have a nice day and abruptly hung up. After I said I wouldn’t be paying right away he pushed me off the phone. This company seems really popular but their hard sales technique is very off putting. I probably would have signed up with the first guy if he weren’t so pushy and eager to have me sign right away.< /text><response>{'time': 1623132091400, 'text': 'Please send an email to customersupport@goaptive.com and one of our representatives will be in touch!

<Review>Signed up for our initial treatment and the rep said we would have a follow up treatment before the quarterly service. It’s been 3 months since the initial treatment and we haven’t been contacted by Aptive EXCEPT to leave a review or refer a friend. I tried calling to follow up and couldn’t get through. I tried the option that says a representative will text message me “immediately” and there was nothing. I’m just wondering if this is a scam of some sort but hoping they will contact me soon since the quarterly service should be approaching.< /Review>< Pictures>

Michelle was prompt, respectfully, very professional and she explained everything she is did. There weren’t any hidden fees or surprises, except for a dead rat she found, thank goodness which she took car fo and then told me about!! We have tried several pest control companies and with three dogs haven’t found one that is safe and effective. Aptive is our goto environmental pest company that we are going to stick with, so happy we know they are taking care of our home, safely!!<//review>

Unfortunately this was a re-service because we are still having an issue with ants AND mosquitoes. The technician was unable to treat for the mosquitoes because he doesn’t have the adequate equipment (a fogger). Need to call again for another technician to come back with a fogger.</review>

They also knock down any wasp/hornet nests and spray under the eves where thy were located to keep them from returning. Several technicians have performed the service but today’s team did the most thorough job that I’ve had in a very long time. I really felt my money was well spent today; they were efficient, thorough and very courteous.
The tech was Kevin Arroyo (not sure of the second persons name, could have been Trevor Massenzo) and I would recommend you request they perform service for you! Very happy with today’s service.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>Elias called to let me know the time he was due to arrive and check it was good. He was thorough in reviewing the issues with whatever is biting me in my yard and listened without wanting to rush me. Once done he gave clear instructions and encouraged me to call if I had further issues as well as what to expect over the next two weeks. Overall he was polite, pleasant and seemed knowledgeable. Time will tell hence the 4 stars. Will upgrade if the results match the service so far.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Aptive sends out professional pesticide technicians to spray my front and back yard to rid of any insects and we have been happy with their services. The gentlemen that came today were David and Kevin, David was kind enough to knock on my door to let me know they were here and checked to see if I had any questions or concerns. They did a detailed professional job making sure they sprayed and swept the eves of the roof and sprayed insect deterrent all the way to the edge of my driveway.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Jeremiah, did a great job today. Very professional. He called before he came out. Spent time explaining everything to me on what he was doing today with the service he provided.
Great company. It helped 100% with our ants and cockroaches. We use them quarterly.

Just had our first service with Aptive. I am so impressed with the level professionalism and attention to detail in treating the exterior of my home for spiders, wasps, and fleas. They discovered two huge wasp nests in our eves that we did not even know were there and removed them safely. Happy new customer!< /review>

I normally don’t like people who sell services door to door but the Aptive salesperson could not have timed his visit any better.  My wife was just cleaning our kitchen cabinets due to ants when he arrived.  The salesman was courteous and explained Aptiva’s services succinctly.  Caleb arrived the next day within the specified service time.  He also was very courteous and professional.  He explained how the service worked and what he would be doing.  So far, I have been pleased with the service.< /Text>

Amir was the agent who came to my home. He was punctual, professional, thorough, polite. My home, yard, and garage was treated. I cannot comment on the results yet but he insisted it is guaranteed and to phone him with any issues. I have not dealt with such professionalism in a long time! Thank you!< /Text>

Aptive nailed it. I just purchased my home a few months ago and had been meaning to get someone out and spray. An Aptive rep named Jake was going door to door in my neighborhood and eventually stopped by my place.  After discussing Aptive and the services they offer I decided to give them a try. I schedule service at a time convenient for me and a week later their rep Caleb came by. Caleb was knowledgeable, personable and professional. He took the time to clear cobwebs and point out areas needing attention that I had previously not noticed. Very impressed with Aptive and their employees!<//Review>

My experience with Aptive Anaheim was great!  Overall, the company provided professional services tailored to meet our needs.  The team of Caleb, Elias, and Brendon showed up on-time and provided excellent customer service.  I liked the fact that environmentally friendly products were used and felt there was good value and high quality services provided.<//review>

<Text>Have used Aptive for several years. They come quarterly to service my yard. They brush the webs from the eves and patio furniture before spraying. If I have a problem in between services which is rare they gladly come out to re treat areas.  Safe for dogs and kids, doesn’t completely take care of all the beasts but worth knowing it is a safe and environmentally sound treatment. So beneficial.< /Text><rate>5< /rate><Response>None</Response></record>

In June, Caleb and another gentlemen came to my house and did a great job getting all the cracks and crevices and working around my dogs and 2 year old. They took their time and were very informative. Thanks guys. Keep up the good work.< /review>

I was a little skeptical when the salesmen signed me up at first but ever since his crew came by I have yet to see a bug so Im very grateful for that because all the other pest control companies over promised and charged way more.</text>

Initially said “no” when approached but caught Tyler at a neighbor’s residence and asked him to come back. You can not beat their pricing or service. Very reasonable monthly pricing and not only do they treat the perimeter of the home but most areas close to it as well. Prompt and professional and you will not be disappointed. By the way, after sting you have any issues before your next scheduled service just give them a call and they come out at no charge to take care of the problem........SERIOUSLY<//Review>

Justin, our initial inspection technician, was on time and delivered a professional and comprehensive treatment. All our eaves were cleaned of spider webs and any wasp nests. He even treated underneath our wicker patio furniture sofas and tables. We were impressed! Thank you Justin and Aptive!</text>

<review>Our Aptive professional exemplified the meaning of the word professional!  First, he followed all CDC guidance on Covid19 and welcomed hearing my concerns about being in the house. He adhered to my protocol! So refreshing when so many are ignoring health guidelines.  Second, he told me how long inside and outside spraying would take. He and his partner were efficient in their duties and detailed, especially when removing spider webs.
I would highly recommend this company. High level service from the company representative who came to our door (who was so knowledgeable and professional) to the field staff!

<Text>This was my first time using this company. I switched because my other company quit performing the things they said that they would do. I was really impressed with our service man. I wish I got his name. He was very friendly and listened to all of my concerns. I am very picky and expect great customer service and I like when everything is done correctly. He did a great job!< /Text><user>103956086429122872511</user><pics>None< /pics>< GmapID>

<text>This time the staff member was not wearing a mask when at the door to talk to me.
Under the current conditions I feel it is very important for the staff to have a mask on when talking to the customer
Also Aptive missed a service and did not contact me. I had to call them and was informed that it was scheduled but not done as the staff member had not shown up

Jeremiah is a very competent and caring person, he even helped me bring in my Christmas tree that the person who delivered it just left it in front of the house, even when they know I was waiting for it, it was kind of heavy. Thanks Jeremiah, a good person and a gentleman . 🙏🙏🙏👌😘😷👨‍👩‍👦‍👦💪< /review>

FIVE STARS to the gentleman who treated our house who was very friendly and knowledgeable. We are having some sort of bug biting problem and I hope he has taken care of it.

ONE STAR for your company which is my real concern. No one is answering your phones. Each time I call I get a long message about unusual wait times, and if I do get a callback it’s from Salt Lake City, Utah. I am in Southern California and you have an office in my county. You promise that if there is a problem between treatments you will send someone right out to handle it. That took nearly two weeks. You missed my last regularly scheduled treatment and I was never contacted. There is no sense of urgency. Are you in the process of going out of business?  That’s what it feels like.</Text>

I had a great first experience with Eric and Justin. They showed up on time and were professional, courteous And knowledgeable. They took their time de-webbing, filling bait stations and spraying outside, in my garage and inside my house. Most thorough service I have had so far and I hope that continues. I was a little apprehensive due to many of the negative reviews I read, but I decided to give them a shot. If their service continues at this rate they will continue to get rave reviews from me.< /Review>

I told our Representative John that we were having some flee issues, he took care of spreading stuff on front and back lawn.  He was very attentive to our needs and cleaned all the high up spots that spiders might be and sprayed all around.  Thank You John for being such a Great Representative 😊👍<//text>

< Review>
I know my house is about to be serviced in a few weeks, but I had activity and that gives me anxiety. I called and they sent someone out. He was kind and went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable in my home.
I’m so grateful. Oh, and they still come back in 2 weeks to service my house on schedule. I’m a very happy customer 😃</Review>

They provided me with additional  information post service, such as what to do and what to expect. Also answered many of questions. I am hoping the treatment will help with the spiders and silver fish around the house.  Thanks guys!< /review>< Response>

Usually this company is very communicative. However, when they had not arrived by 5pm, I called and they told me they would be there in 2 hours - which would then be dark. At around 7:15 I received a message they ran out of light and will reschedule.  OK - however never told when they would return. Turns out they came today unannounced.  I wanted to show them some areas.<//text>

The Aptive exterminator was professional, friendly, and punctual. He answered all of my questions and made sure I understood the service he was going to perform and also made sure I understood my contract. I’m very happy I answered the door a few weeks ago when the sales manager came to market this company. Thank You, APTIVE!!</Text>

The young man arrived on time, and I own a duplex, he started with my rental first. Then proceeded to spray my house, and he sprayed everywhere, inside and out, then he brushed all the spiderwebs outside. I was very please with the job he did, and they are coming back in 40 days.<//review>

< Review>
Signed up for long term service. I was told my contract price would be $110 per quarter, but contract states $120. Asked for correction, and no one has replied.

Initial service date was 8/4. We were told after initial treatment, they'd come back in 20 days or so to do an additional. It's been 30 days and no one has been by our scheduled to come by. Our insect pest problem is worse than when we had no pest control service at all.</Review>

<review>The trail service was good. But, that was the end of it.  I have been trying to get an appointment since there is a rat issue. The website doesn't have a place to make an appointment.  I have emailed asking for an appointment.  I have called and left voice mails for call back three days in a roll, but have not been contacted.

Each call is on hold for 30 minutes and then the system would say there is currently no rep ready and to leave a voice mail for call back.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I am not totally unhappy with my actual treatment, but I am very unhappy with the horrible customer service at the office level. If you try to call, you will be on hold forever. I was kept on hold for over 20 minutes, at which point I was told my number was noted and I would be called back by the next available representative, and my call was disconnected. That was two days ago and I still haven’t gotten a call back. I had a very simple quick question, what time would the technician be at my house, as I’d gotten a text just that day that they’d be servicing my house the next day. I even tried to send an email to circumvent having to call them, as I know every time I’ve called, it’s a very long wait on hold. And they are apparently aware of this as they say during the hold recording not to call back and hit the option for sales because sales people don’t know anything about the technical side. But they haven’t done anything to rectify the issue, I guess once you’re a customer you’re not worthy of having your time respected. I would not recommend this company until they greatly improve their customer service at the office level.</Text>

<Review>Courteous and knowledgeable personnel! Job was conducted professionally. Looks like your team loves their positions. Loved our first service call. Even setting our initial appointment was enjoyable!  Looking forward to seeing the results. Pincher bugs/earwigs are a problem.

Thanks Aptive!

"They" serviced my home for the 1st time today and will return in about a month or less.  After they get going, the servicing will be spread out further apart.  But if I see any little creepy crawlers around, all I have to do is pick up my phone and give them a call.
Very, very professional company.  And "no" I do not work for them.. Infact, I've never even heard of them before.</review>

< Review>
Someone text me from aptiv that I was going to be serviced between 1-5. So I locked my dogs in the house from 1-5. The gentleman that came to spray was very sweet and apologetic and said that his sheet said 4-8. I explained that I have a dog on chemo and he cannot be locked up for such a long time as some of the chemo make him need the outside more often. He was kind a respectful and apologized. I tried to call your office but apparently everybody else was calling probably for the same thing. Your phone service disconnected me and told me there were not reps to speak with and to leave my contact info after I was on hold for close to 30 minutes. If this is how your company does business not sure I will stay with you.<//Review>

Had a window from 8 to 10 am appointment. 11:30 I called and cancelled service as if this is even a hint of future services plus a 2 yr contract. Tech didn’t bother text or call about late. Expect 20 to 30 minutes hold times. Went with Western Exteminators, no contract and month to month. Should have read reviews first.</text>

Did not keep appointment time frame and showed up at 7:45pm when I was gone.  I had the house all closed for the appointment, and opened back up when they didn't show.  Came back to a note at 8pm and my house stinking like bug spray.</Text>< pics>

<review>I signed up a couple of days ago, when contacting them, had to call a few times and wait about 20 minutes each time before Michael answered my call.  He helped with cancelling my service, it was easy and got an email confirmation right away.  They are very professional and the service tech did a great job on my initial service.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Disappointed with the extent of service available. Called regarding wasps in the void of our roof eaves and when they arrived I was informed the company does not provide them with proper gear and or equipment to spray above the head. So a quick spray around the perimeter and gone, along with my money.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Antoine was awesome!  He was so knowledgeable about wasps and immediately took care of the nests I had seen and then walked out property looking for anything I had not seen. Aptive is the best pest control service (and I have had many different companies since living in south county!)<//Review>

But, holy cow trying to talk to anybody with this company over the phone is absolutely excruciating.  Horrible customer service and website is subpar.  Phone calls take over 30 minutes on hold.  Also, they give you less than 24 hour notice before your quarterly service.  This use to seem like a family business, but it's not.< /text><time>1595526078360</time>< response>

He called ahead, waited for me to get home like 30 mins in the hot sun, he received me with a smile and helped me with all my needs; He did it with a smile and asked anything I can spray for you before I go? Did I miss anything? I smiled and said nothing.

He was Amazing great customer service and very polite and professional.</Text>

Aptive has the worst customer service of any company that I have ever dealt with.  I am 79 years old.  Aptive sends me an email for a  date for service.  I respond with an email saying that due to construction it is an unsafe time for the service.  The technician shows up, he can hear the jack hammers.  I sent him on his way.  So Artive reschedules for the next business day!!< /text>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>So far I have not been impressed. The service started a month ago; no decrease in pests. They said it was because the “adult pests” were killed off and the new ones would be treated on the next round. They came today. Talked to the guy in the phone; he was nice. But he was supposed to treat the baseboard on the inside of the house per our request - which he verified by saying he’d finish the outside border then knock on the door to Do the inside- but apparently only did the outside ....then left.  I didn’t realize he left until I receive a text  asking for a review. I walked outside... gone. I called the same number he called me from at the beginning of the service treatment to have him come back and finish, but no answer.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>The salesman who came to the door made promises that the product could not meet ... he listed numerous pests that the service would meet ... white files was one that we needed addressed and were assured could be dealt with but when the technician came, he said they could not do anything about white flies ... we are disappointed with the professionalism of this company</Review></record>

A rep came to our door and mentioned they were in our neighborhood so I agreed to the service. However I mentioned having roaches inside the house and roaches in the garage but the rep only sprayed the exterior of the house real quick and left without ever treating indoors. I tried calling the rep’s phone number provided to me on a flyer shortly after but he is not picking up. Just feels like I got partial service.< /Review>

The Operator on the phones that I spoke with this morning, Chelsea, was uninformed, ineffective, and out right rude to me.  I say uninformed because otherwise she lied to my face.  At the end of the phone conversation, I was ready to terminate my use of Aptiv’s services.
However Justin S., the technician, has made me reconsider my decision because he did such a thorough and complete job, especially in removing spider webs and wasps nests. He and his work receive a five star rating.  However Aptiv phone Operator Chelsea, who informed me that she is the account manager when I asked to speak with her supervisor rather than transferring me to her superior, receives one star, and that just because she picked up the phone and answered it.
The five star rating is completely and totally for Justin S, the technician who did the work today.</text>

we had been discussing having a company come out to address some issues with Bees/Wasps in a new home we had just moved into.  A sales rep knocked on our door saying he was in the area and it seemed like timing.  we set up our first treatment on the outside of the home, the technician showed up, he had not received the notes from the sales rep, we went over all the issues that needed addressed, and they went to work, when they finished they showed us what they had done and made notes for the next visit they also notified us that if we needed to have a them come out again before our next quarterly treatment just use the app and schedule them to come out.  We noticed a few weeks later the bees/wasps were still a huge problem, so I used the app, submitted many pictures and I thought, scheduled a revisit but we never received a confirmation of any visit, so I logged into the app again, and there was no visit or pictures, so I did it again, I can see by logging on the customer portal that there is a scheduled visit for July 27, I did not get any notification about visit being scheduled.  I tried using the app again and the app isn't even allowing me to log in now.  I tried calling and I sit on hold forever.  There is no place on the website to email customer service.  I am frustrated, as I have signed up for a yearly contract and will be charged to cancel the contract, however, I am so fair not impressed with the level of service we have seen to-date.  If the technician does not show up on July 27th I will be canceling the contract and I will not be paying for the cancellation.<//Text>

For a service call, the technician always come and speaks to me and ask if there is anything im having trouble with, bugs or other rodents and where i think there is a problem. They treat that area, clean under the eve's, and perform a "complete service".

Thanks</Review>

<Review>I hate having to leave this review. After persistent sales tactics we signed up. Our first service was Friday June 26th. By Monday we had an increase of ants indoors.  We responded to the technicians email and had no followup. The following week, the spiders came inside and ants migrated to new locations in the backyard. We called the sales person, no answer. The technicians number was disconnected. We sent an email, no response. The following week tried calling the office, downloading the App, calling any number we could find. Then the ants went on attack,, lining the ceiling of our entire living room. We tried scheduling a followup visit via the app...no callback. Weve posted on our community website, texting, calling...NO RESPONSE. They were quick to take payment and now...nothing. I cannot recommend. We have since purchased insecticides,  ant bait, etc to remediate the problem ourselves.</Review>< GmapID>

<review>Wow! I have to share how appreciative I am of how professional these young men are.  They arrived well within the early side of the schedule window.  As a first time client, I was reassured as they provided me first with an opportunity to explain some of the areas where I was most concerned and they clearly paid attention patiently as I do tend to ‘over explain.’  Martin then reassured me about the best practices and safest solutions and provided a friendly but thorough explanation of all the services they would be providing on this first call.  Then they went to work and they did not miss a single ‘nook or cranny.’  I’m very glad that l learned of this service!  Now, just 30 hours later, we are already seeing a noticeable difference in the amount of small pests that for decades have invaded our property and caused us to stay on guard while we’ve worked around our plants and gardens or just relaxed in the shade of our back yard patio.  THANK YOU APTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>I did not have a very good experience. The technician came and finished within 5 min. He did not make me aware of the treatment he did. He didn't even address my concerns. Nor did he move object to ensure he spray the solution everywhere. Extremely disappointed with experience.<//review>< pics>

I bought a new house in a nice neighborhood and wanted to have a good pest control service to keep the bugs at bay.  Jake was going door to door and did a house evaluation.  He was able to point out areas of concern and even found a number of black widows with egg sacks.  The initial price was $129 per quarter for complete treatment with unlimited retreats for free. We went over all my areas of concern with fleas, flies, mosquitoes, silver fish and gnats.  The first service was good, the tech seemed to know what he was doing and was professional. My only complaint was that the tech was not able to fully treat my Ivy wall as I specifically asked Jake about.  He said that the sales guys are from Utah and dont know California regulations.  Apparently they arent allowed to treat anything over 4 feet.  SO if i have an 8' tall green wall that is bug and spider central, they cant treat it.   Over the course of the month after the treatment I noticed a significant increase in bug activity.  I called.  It took 4 calls and then be put on a call back list to talk to someone.   The service tech came, at an unannounced time, far after the scheduled appointment.  He then said that my watering was the problem. Now I am not a bug specialist, but I water 5 minutes at a shot 4 days/week.  That doesn't seem like a lot.  I also have it set to manual mode, so the sprinklers are not going off without my knowledge.  I am not over watering.  Then to my suprise, he hands me another $129 bill.  he said because its the start of a new quarter, there is another charge.  My first treatment was in June.  They apparently go by calendar quarter not start of service.  I got on the phone with customer service again (took four days to get a call back) and the customer service person proceeds to tell me they dont treat for Gnats and the standard treatment i am paying for only covers a 3 foot perimeter around the house. Full yard treatment is more under an additional service contract.   They are misrepresenting their service capabilities, and treatment methods.  Do not use this service. I am back to Pacific Pest control I used at another house.< /Text>

<text>This company is difficult to contact when you are in the midst of a hostile bug take over. They do not have any personal communication with you once they sign you up for a contract. Beware - I signed up, was given a service start date (which was not when they came - instead I was not home) and I don’t know what was done but it wasn’t what the sales guy sold me on. I’ve tried getting in touch via the app, email and phone (with outrageous hold times) with a spray time two and a half weeks beyond when I started the process of requesting help. Terrible service, terrible response time and I don’t see any significant difference in supposed product effectiveness.

Very dissatisfied customer!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Time>

< Review>
I requested an “extra service” between my quarterly appointments specifying that I needed service inside my home for roaches. The team arrived and stated it was my quarterly scheduled visit and they would not be entering the house. When I expressed exasperation with the poor communication, they suggested they leave and allow another team to return on a different date.  They remained, sprayed and left within nine minutes.< /Review>

< Review>
i have spent 4 hours over the last three days to cancel service because i still have spiders that i pay to have them removed. the worst part is no one answers the cancel service line, i did press 2 for new service and they answer right away and when i ask to cancel they just forward me to line 3 and i just sit on hold and no answer. They have the worst phone support i have ever dealt with. if i could give them zero stars I would have.</Review>

DO NOT FALL FOR THIS. They have very persuasive and pushy sales people that will stop at nothing to get you to sign the contract and pay right away. They will result to guilt tactics and seemingly give you "special and exclusive discounts" if you sign up right away. They know people are going to push back so they've hiked their prices up in order to "discount" them in front of you to hook you into signing a very long and deceptive contract.

*If you've already signed the contract, then YOU HAVE 3 BUSINESS DAYS TO CANCEL WITHOUT PENALTY otherwise you'll be charged a hefty $249-$349 cancellation fee. Make sure to sign and date Page 3 of the contract (the page that says "Notice of Cancellation" at the top) and email it or drop it off in person within 3 business days of signing the contract.

By the way, the sales person did not mention the contract cancellation fee until I kept digging and asking more questions. Finally they said they'd knock it down from $349 to $200. After the sales person left, I read the contract and it had $249 listed as a cancellation fee. Super DECEPTIVE. *Read the contract before you sign anything.*

Also, they should not be sending Sales people DOOR to DOOR during the CORONAVIRUS pandemic. It is NOT over yet. There are spikes in cases every day and most of the houses in my neighborhood they are pitching to are elderly and at risk. This is horrible business practice. Also the sales person was not wearing a mask.

This review is NOT a review on their actual service. I cannot attest to whether or not it is quality or worth the price. However, even if the services were good, there are plenty of other decent pest control companies with honest and upfront business practices and pricing. Based on their sales tactics alone, I cannot recommend Aptiv at all.<//review>

This company is a total RIP off scam. I made an appointment for service. I was stood up again and received a robot call that said they'd be out in a couple of days. It's been two weeks. No one answers the phone. I've stayed for one year of hellish service because they charge you if you cancel before one year. My contract is up and I can't find anyone to answer a phone so that I can cancel. They don't even have an answer machine to talk into. I contacted their alleged 24 hour email service and cancelled via email.  I've heard nothing back from that either.But, I'm expecting them to not comply. I am filing a complaint with the BBB.  I've NEVER received a decent service. They do NOT do what they promise. Stay away from them!<//Review>

Tried service for 1 year.  called to cancel at end of year and told on the phone that I cannot cancel until after the last treatment or they would not send the tech, even though we paid for a full year.
when I called after the last treatment, was told I have to talk to a manager, who tried to hard-sell me to stick around.  Beware, they make it hard to get out of contracts!<//text>

I called to have Aptive come by to spray for spiders and also to bring a couple of rat traps since they only had 1 at the last visit. When the 2 Aptive guys came by today, they switched out the rat traps but didn’t spray for spiders which was the main reason we called. They said our quarterly service will be in a couple of weeks to do that. I’m a bit frustrated since I was not informed of that when I called.< /Text>

I asked them to spray inside the garage (not the normal service) as well as spray an ant hill on my yard, and they did both willingly. Even applied some seeds to my yard to prevent the ants from moving to another location.<//Review>

<Review>Its like they planted bug eggs on my property. There have been massive spiders popping up and when I send emails, I don't get any responses! This is my 2nd time of giving them a chance and never again will they be on my property! The last time they sent a technician, they didn't even get out of their vehicle!!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>
