Leah and Mike were incredible!! Collectively they spent almost 5 hours with me helping me find my new phone, transferring everything just as it was and helping me understand all the new functions. The whole experience was stellar.  This type of customer service is rare, and I will be recommending them to everyone I know.<//Text>

Leah did an awesome job at helping me out two days ago with my new phone. She totally turned a bad situation into a great experience and I love my new phone. She took the time to help me with my new phone and all of the features I needed to know. The accessories are amazing including the wireless charger and jbl speaker. Thank you< /Review>

Victor is extremely helpful & knowledgeable. He helped me 2 years ago with my phone upgrade and again yesterday with another upgrade. It’s people like him that will have me coming back to this particular store. He’s straightforward, trustworthy, personable with an infectious laugh. His professionalism is next level - I watched him help another customer with special needs and it was heartwarming to witness his ease of talking with her, and his ability to swiftly get her the phone she came for while also still helping me with my upgrade. Thank you Victor! I so appreciate you!! Excellent customer service.</Text>

<Review>Victor was very helpful, very friendly and informative. He was patient with our many questions and was very kind. He helped us pick our new phones based on what we wanted and needed and was very efficient in swapping us over and keeping us distracted with light hearted conversation while we waited for the phones to do their things. 10/10 Victor deserves a raise<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

My wife and I came to look at options for upgrading phones and switching carriers. Cesar and the other employee (young lady) were incredibly helpful and helped us find a plan that best fit our needs and budget. They both went above and beyond and I hope their manager understands how great these two employees are! Thanks for all of the help today!< /text>

Victor Paz was extremely helpful in closing my brother’s account after his untimely passing away. Victor went the extra mile and was willing to do all possible to help during a very difficult time. He made the process easy and convenient for me and I really appreciated his kindness and thorough attention to getting everything finalized. Wish AT&T would
clone him as it’s hard to find that level of service when dealing with AT&T. He is a valuable asset to the company and deserves a raise!</text>

Victor Paz was an amazing help when my husband traded in his cell phone. Not only did Victor patiently help my husband change over everything on  his old cell phone to his new one, he magically found a way to actually decrease the bill even after adding another line. Wow! Finally, he told my husband if he struggled getting everything on his ipad, then he could return to the store for help! Now THAT is service!< /Review>

<review>Last week I visited the store to get a new connection to my wife and port my connection. As a new bee to USA and I went with tens of questions in my mind. Met Victor Paz and he is simply awesome! He explained each and every detail about the best possible connection plans, device trade options and billing details. I was amazed as it almost took more than 2 hours to complete the whole process (Data transfer took lots of time) including 40 mins after hours, he is so kind!  Like others already mentioned, Victor is an outstanding customer service representative with extremely helpful nature. He is definitely a valuable asset to ATT&T, deserves next level in his career. I wish him all the best and thank you Victor for providing the best customer experience!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dc731e03fe1e91:0xfd6d9848019c8725< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It’s a big relief. I appreciate the quick and knowledgeable  response</text>

<Text>By far the BEST AT&T store I have ever been to. Stella was our main helper, and Victor was the store manager helping her a bit, and Melissa was also there to help me upgrade my phone and help me choose the best one for my life style when I was unsure. They walked me through all the steps and REALLY helped me choose the right one. Stella was so kind helping me with accessories and installing them on my phone and so was Melissa, who showed me all the variety of accessories. Victor also went out of his way, even with a busy store, to make sure my contract was right and called AT&T Service right then and there for me and had the whole 30 minute conversation. The customer service at this place was absolutely incredible and I was so impressed. They will definitely have my service again! Thank you guys!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I went in to see what my options were to get a new phone because my current phone is having a mid-life crisis. Luckily, I got Brandon to help me. He answered all 100 (literally) questions I asked and was extremely helpful! I would go back to this location and I recommend asking for Brandon!< /Review>

One person in the entire store and when a second showed up, he didn't offer to help, was dressed so slovenly a clown looks more professional and then he wouldn't shut up about his personal life.  The associate helping me didn't actual help at all.  She actually made the problem worse.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Eventually I went with bringing in an old phone that they reactivated with my line.  Ed was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  I know going with contract carriers can be more expensive depending on the plan that suits you, but you get what you pay for, and this was one of the best customer service experiences I have had with any company.  They even went through my contract to take out services and fees no longer in use. Will definitely come back to this store, and I highly recommend it due to the quality of the employees.< /Text>< date>

Finally, he refused to serve us and sent us to other location, as he would not know, nor would he make an effort to solve it.
Never met one like him, really one of a kind.</Text></record>

Victor Paz is a very talented and courteous professional who deeply cares about his customers.  Not only did he resolve my  communication problem but assisted my husband and I with switching over our cellphone service to AT&T.  In addition, he was also instrumental in unifying our other AT& T services of the internet and the TV as well.  AT&T is very well represented by Alex Paz< /Review>

This AT&T store is completely distrustful. They quote you on your contract then raise your payment without your knowledge. I had to go to the store 4 different months and still being overcharged. DO NOT GO THERE!!!</review>

<Review>Went in to this store this morning to upgrade my phone. I was greeted and helped by Ed who took the time to look over my plan and was able to save me money on my bill . I was so impressed with how he went out of his way to help me save money and get me a new phone. He suggested the LG G5 since i like to  take alot of pictures and Im loving the phone so far. His reccomendation and excellent customer service is why I love AT&T. Love going into this store will be back soon to get my daughter a new phone!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Simka can buy, all the charging and accessories are unoriginal, but at high prices, which is frustrating

<Review>Came here to eat dinner and it was average. Still enjoy Grill City much more... food seems fresher at Grill City too. For those of you that don't know, Grill City is inside of Seafood City. There is also a really fishy smell while you eat... not really appetizing. Employees can also be a bit more friendly.< /Review>< name>

<text>I am very dissapointed of the quality of their fish. for a store that just open they should have fresh and quality seafood but sea food city have better quality than here. Still would give 2 stars for friendly service</text><date>1487192361752< /date>< Name>

My first visit yesterday revealed a small store with limited fish & produce.  Soon a major competitor store will open in the area, who is known for mass sales of produce and fish.  It will be interesting to see how this store will fare.  The food court is quite expensive.
I will shop at the other store exclusively for the greater variety, freshness, seafood, utensils, savings and more when they open.<//text>

Though it's missing a large variety of options , it's a decent Asian market. The BBQ and hot food here is decent , and you get a whole Crispy Pata for $13 Or a pound of Chicharon Bulaklak for $13 as well.</Text>

<text>Did groceries to Island Pacific today, Monday, around 1:40 pm, went to cashier to pay all my items and ask the cashier (name Joy) for 3 plastic bag. Everything's just fine, she kept scanning my items but to my surprise she is not bagging it?!! I thought she  will bag them at the end but she didn't! She actually wants me to bag all my stuff so i ask her" so the customer now  is also the bagger???" She said "Only when there's a long line", i dont mind bagging it but i'm the only customer in the line, so its not really that busy.why did she want me to bag all these!! Every cashier there are doing their job except this lady named Joy! So DISSAPOINTED!!!to think that the store just open and the service is already this bad!! If you dont like customer service then this job is not for you!!!< /text>< name>

Super cute wine bar in town. Good ambience, respectful crowd, and a live band on Fridays and Saturdays! Comfy couches to sit on if you get there early enough to take dibs. Trivia games/card games available for fun around the bar. I'm probably here about once or twice a month, usually with a friend or date visiting from out of town. Have tried some of the plates here and wouldn't order them again. Just come for the wine and atmosphere! I've been to all 3 or 4 of the wine bars in town and this one tops them all. The owner is also super sweet.</Review>

<text>We absolutely love Wine 661 . Not once have we been disappointed with our meal. Lately we've been sitting at the small bar for drinks and dinner. Our only complaint is the tall bartender whose superior attorney attitude is a big turn off. We love sitting at the bar, but the thought of him leaves us asking ourselves if we really want to ever return or just make a table reservation.

The best. Even when it's super busy, Tanya provides the best customer service. Extensive wine selection and great live music. We were bummed when Valencia Wine Co. closed because we thought we wouldn't find another winr bar that we loved, but we were pleasantly surprised. We've been coming to 661 for several months and we're completely hooked.</text>

Small venue, nice ambient, good wine variety, but was only one person taking care of customers... can't manage a place like this with one person... We end up leaving cause we could not get anything to eat...< /Text>

Ehhh. Ok. How do I go about this. It's a sweet little spot and I don't want to be mean because I can tell it's a really small business that's operated the owners, and I respect that. They're accommodating and nice. They had good live music. The live music could go later, especially on a Saturday night. They play predominantly 70's era music as far as I can tell - it's good and something different. The space is comfy and super small/cozy.
It is pri-cy. Yup - don't go if you're not looking to spend nearly a minium of $15 for a glass of beer or wine. Wowsers. They had a wine flight but a beer flight -strange.<//Text>

Stumbled upon this as my sister and I were looking to grab a drink and relax. It was perfect! We got there before 5:00 on a Friday and received very attentive service. The manager suggested a flight of wines, so we tried a few different types: pinot noirs, a merlot, a cab, a rioja, and a blend. She graciously helped us learn some of the vocabulary that goes along with wine tasting. We each settled on one we liked and ordered a glass, and a cheese plate. The cheeses were scrumptious. We enjoyed ourselves, relaxed, and learned a thing or two during the course of the evening! It was a terrific experience and we'll be back. Oh, and they have tastings on Thursdays!</text>

<text>For great wine, the best live music in Santa Clarita, and exceptional customer service, there is no place better than Wine 661. The opposite of a pretentious wine bar, Wine 661 is a relaxing, laid back favorite for regulars and out-of-towners alike, without all of the college aged meatheads that hang out in restaurant bars. The owner Tanya makes everyone feel welcome and at home, unlike other wine bars in town which are more often uppity and snooty. They also have an excellent happy hour and  beer selection. Visit midweek for a quiet evening, or head over on Fridays and Saturdays when they have their great live music. Make sure to ask about their wine tasting events; some of California's finest wineries often visit to pour four or five selections at a great price. This bar wins awards annually for a reason!</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Tanya, the owner, is delightful!  She's a classy lady with some classy wines in a very classy place.  The establishment is designed to make you feel at home....a home that's in a different world.  Ambience is great!   I especially enjoyed the La Rochelle Winery Pinot Noir Russian River Valley.  That paired with the tomato, basil, mozzarella panini ---YUM!  Great selection of vino & snacks.  (I shouldn't post this review because then more people will go and it seems to be one of SCV's best kept secrets.)  Enjoy!<//Text>

The sandwiches here are good. Not the best but good. However, today I was highly disappointed by the service. I paid extra for avocado. I got two drops of avocado. When I told them I didn't get the avocado they pointed to the small green smudge on my cheese. Nope. That's not $1 of avocado. Seriously frustrated by the lack of customer care.< /text>

The sandwiches are good but a bit pricey. I think Jersey Mike's is better but that's personal preference because it feels they give more meat.  The staff is friendly and the decor is funny.<//Text>

My first time trying Jimmy John's and they didn't disappoint. The staff is ridiculously cheerful, harmoniously greeting everyone who walks through the door. And then thanking you with best wishes as you leave. In fact, my server was so sweet, that when she suggested add-ons to my sandwich, I just agreed, without question (not realizing that the add-ons were nearly half the price of the sandwich). But it was worth it. The sandwich was really good (add-ons and all). The dining area and restrooms are immaculate. I mean the place sparkles, it's so clean. I will be back.<//Text>

<review>Fast service. Not inviting at all. 6:30 pm and every chair is upside down on tables. Looks closed. I've had a sandwich from here as part of a catered working lunch. Cute half sandwiches in logo bags. It was good. Went in to store and ordered ham and cheese. Lousy quality fake tasting chopped pressed and cooked ham. Cheese that's sliced soooo thin you can see through it. Fast service cuz the meats and cheese is weighed and arranged to fit the bread then refrigerated between sheets of waxed paper.  This helps the meat taste like cheese and the cheese taste like meat. Brilliant!  And what's with all these five star reviews and two words.  Or poor grammar.  Sounds shady.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd5da773a7b09:0x31d48bba3290634< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Sandwiches are very tasty. The only bad thing there is the drinking water. I asked for a cup for water and proceeded to get some at the soda dispenser. The water was some of the worst I have ever tasted! Worse than tap water! Please put some kind of filtration system in place so the water tastes better.  Not all of us drink soda. Thanks</Review>< Pictures>

I've been disappointed my last 2 visits. Employees who just dont listen. Then you get home to a sandwich that's not what you wanted, not what you ordered, just not right. I'm not going back. Male employees both times. 2 different locations both times. I have a location near my home, I might try it, I'm not sure. It just feels like a little too much for a sandwich. Also, I struggle with this place because of the owners Big Game Hunting semantics. I don't think that it's cool and really don't want to support any of his trips to go kill animals for sport. #stopitjimmyjohnitsnotcool</text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>Ordered a BLT. The worst sandwich I have ever had. Bread is stale and lliterally 3 pieces of bacon on sandwich and it's tough and looks like it's been out for a while. Called and told manager. He says sorry you had a bad experience. REALLY? How about you step up your game and offer fresh food.  No wonder people go to Subway! First and last time ever.

Wasnt all that. They dont even put your food in a bag. We ordered 3 sandwiches to go and they just handed us the sandwiches. Nothing special.</review>

<text>These guys are great..
Did a brake job today. Since they can turn rotors at 25 bucks each vs new at 75 a piece i saved 100 bucks just right there. Ask for Ryan.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pics>

<text>Breaking down anywhere is no fun ordeal but I'm sure glad I broke down near this Napa. The employees were great very proffesional friendly and knowledgeable and they saved my ads. My water pump went out and was leaking bad so I couldn't drive to the store. They delivered the part to me within 15 mins. Great service I will go out of my way to patronize this parts store. It's too bad there's not many stores that treat you like this one. Great experience will definitely buy my parts there when I'm in the area.< /text><GmapID>0x80944a5037bdf6ef:0x9ec0cd8e7adc0df2</GmapID>< Pics>

Most of time you can get anything at this Napa by the next day even though this store is fairly remote being the last & only auto parts store before you get to Shaver Lake. This is not a Walmart or some hardware store with an auto section, this is a true auto parts store with the Napa name behind it. The guys that work there are pretty knowledgeable and if they can't get what you need they'll point you in the direction you need to go. Now this place is not the cheapest but giving the circumstances I stated above I have never been disappointed in getting my parts here plus they also have a hydraulic hose making machine that's invaluable.<//review>

These guys are terrific!  Went in with a broken wiper arm. They found me a spare part and helped me fix it - all no charge! Very friendly and helpful.  Not the first good experience I’ve had here. I will go out of my way to do more business here.<//Text>

I use the wash and fold service. Always done on time or early. It’s folded nicely and under garments are bagged separately.</review>

<Review>Don't use the wash and fold service.

1.Sudden schedule change without notice
: I ordered pick up on Friday and delivery on Saturday but they suddenly changed the delivery date on Monday and told me this on Friday when the driver came home.

2. Late for delivery
: The delivery date was Monday between 1 pm to 3 pm but got delivery on Tuesday after 4 pm.

3.Missing laundry
: Driver came home 3 times to get missing laundry. Found 2 strange clothes inside my laundry. Eventually couldn't found some of my towels.

< Review>
This place has always been my go to wash house but after todays encounter. This shall be my last time. I have never had any problems with staff they have ways been nice until today. Disrespectful unprofessional and unacceptable customer service is what I got today. And I will make it known. I will not be spending my money here again.< /Review>

Came to my laundry spot for the first time for a last minute wash only right before closing and was able to get it done and dried.not only that they had Monday night football on. Nice facility and Ashley provided great friendly customer service. Great experience.< /review>

<text>I just want to say thank you to Ashley because she is very helpful.
Yesterday my son misplaced the detergent and Ashley fixed the problem. Also Ashley helped me to know how many loads of clothes I can put in the washer machines, and when I came back to pick up my clothes from the dryer machine, Ashley told me that she added more time because some clothes were wet.
Thanks Ashley, you are the best.< /text>< pics>

<review>We frequent this laundry spot. We were customers to the previous owners. It’s a great place except they advertise a children’s corner and the last 3 times we’ve been here it hasn’t been working or the staff said they didn’t want to turn it on. Children’s corner is helpful when trying to get laundry done with kids. Also the staff was rude to my child. Maybe if they had the activity corner working my kid would have something to do.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

< Review>
Omg! Am I really Seeing this? That’s what I asked myself. I am in love with this laundry place 🥰🥰🥰. Just love the staff and everything. Robert was cool 😎. The only thing I am concerned about is the restrooms are nice and clean and easily accessible to everyone which is kind of bothering for me because there are always bunch of transients hanging around. I would really suggest that it should have a code or a key and should be accessible only to its customers. Also, I just saw a lady bringing in her wet laundry for free drying. I think they should really not encourage that and should only provide the service to people who give them business. Overall, I wanna go back again! This laundry place ROCKS!!!!!👍🏼< /Review>

{'time': 1545409165080, 'text': "Thank you so much for the review Shilpa.  Your concern was originally one of our main concerns as well.  Just so you know, the bathroom does have a key pad which the attendant has to come back and open.  There will be an attendant there at all times.  Keeping transients away from our location will always be a priority, and the bathroom that we completely remodeled will only be accessible to our customers because of the key code lock that keeps it locked at all times.  This is the way we will make sure it will always be clean.  As for our free dry, the system will be changed within a couple weeks to only allow for free dry with a purchase of a regular wash.  So that is already in motion as well.  Again, thank you so much.  We truly want feedback so that we can continue to make this location better for our customers.  Can't wait to see you in the laundromat soon!"}< /response>

The dryers run cool, thus requiring multiple cycles. The staff is actively rude and often ignorant regarding those with disabilities. Crowded, tight space that makes mobility an issue. Wouldn't recommend or use again.<//text>

This is how a laundromat SHOULD BE!

It's clean. It's efficient. It's community friendly!

It's amazing to be inside. Good vibes. Awesome artwork. Great music.

I'm impressed.

Never been to a laundromat on this one's level!<//Review>

The experience depends on the staff. A lot of the times it's a girl with brown messy hair that is there but she is always so rude. The lady is always talking on the phone or to her friends. She doesnt attend to the little store. She can never be found. Can never find any space in there. A lot of junkies and drunks are usually outside<//review>

<review>We love Aloro!!!
My four dogs and I have been fans for the past three years...
Always friendly, always happy to help, the docs are wonderful and the staff is professional.
I had been taking my guys to another vet, but they became so cold and "corporate" ( they were swallowed up by one of the big hospital chains) that we needed a switch.
Aloro is like family.
Better prices too!</review>< Pictures>

Doctors and the workers are kind with the pets. Since I found this place I was taking my beautiful chihuahua she was good taking care by her doctor. So if someone wants a vet for her/his dog or cat this is the place you could bring it here. I would not change it for another place. 🐶🐱< /Text>

<Text>Can’t trust this place. They keep taking down my post.  Anyways they won’t take in animals when they have 2 hours left open because “it’s not there problem.”

When I went in the past it took hours to get a simple check up. So if you like waiting this place is for you!< /Text>< Pictures>

I have to say that even tho the visit didn't have the outcome I hoped for, i am extremely thankful for the staff and doc for all they did. From the moment we came in everybody was super sweet, very knowledgeable and on point. Did all necessary testing and suggested several ways to approach the diagnoses. The biggest thank you I would like to give to the technician Amando. He went above and beyond to make the visit as comfortable as possible. He is truly an asset to this hospital. I would highly recommend them.</Text>

My experience at Aloro PET Clinic has been a great one. The veterinarian doctors are very knowledgeable. The front desk staff are friendly and professional. I trust them with Rocky's life and health. No complaints from me or my Dog Rocky. Thank you Aloro PET Clinic. You guy's are awesome!!!<//Review>

I love Aloro Pet Hospital. They give thoughtful and compassionate care to our beloved pets. Always feel like each vet I have seen there tries to do everything possible to make our pets comfortable there. The doctors are all so professional. They call when they say they will call and give great care and advice.< /Text>

<text>Aloro is the only pet clinic I'll take my cat to. They never push unnecessary treatments on you, they're always up front, and it's always genuine. I'll never forget the time they let me borrow their crate so that I could save a feral cat and her kittens in downtown. They trusted me with their belongings, and they were happy to help, for no benefit. Honestly, I would recommend Aloro to anyone!<//text><user_name>marti farless< /user_name>< response>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Do NOT GO TO THIS PLACE, my cat had to get stitches and they put that plastic collar around her nexk and tied her neck so tight she was crying so hard when we picked her up but didn't notice it until we got home because we thought it was the medication. It was cutting her circulation off it was so tight and deadly she could of died. I just couldn't believe the doctor let that happen. My poor cat, she's an older cat too I hate she had to experience that. So I'm writing this comment for her and so no other cat or dog will have to experience this. She's never been the same since. She's paranoid all the time.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Great people, great service, very clean, & always go above & beyond to help. Only thing that would improve would be if they would have water or offer water for the pets once in the Dr.s waiting room area since the pets may been working up thrust prior due to the trip there or heat outside. In all great place for you pets to go!<//Review>

I have been taking my dog, Lotus, to Aloro for 5 years and I have experienced exceptional care for Lotus. They often greet her by name, even if it has been a while since we have visited. She is treated with care and love. She has had consistent ear infections and they have tried several methods to treat this.
Veterinary services are never cheap anywhere, unless you're looking for basic vaccines at a clinic. With this in mind, I have always found Aloro's prices to be reasonable.

I would highly recommend Healthy Paws Pet Insurance too; they cover 95% of your pets vet fees for moderate to serious procedures.< /review>

I entered, came to the front desk to check my cat in and a big huge dog came in and the workers put this big huge dog by my cat. My cat was so scared I had to say something and tell them to please not have a 150 pound dog by my 6 pound cat. He was crying and hissing it was terrible. Why would any employee think that would be ok when my cat already is in a cage and is getting ready for treatment and already scared because he's been taken out of his environment. It put so much stress on him, made it worse. This is such POOR SERVICE. HORRIBLE</text>

<text>I have been taking me dog here for quite some years. I have moved from North Hollywood to Santa clarita and I still take my dog to this clinic. They know my dog and she knows them. It's hard for a dog to know or like anyone especially a chihuahua and if you have a dog like mine you know what I mean. I recommend this clinic to my family and friends.

Dr. Garha, the assistants and especially ALL of the lovely ladies who tend to the front office are REMARKABLY wonderful to work with. We have been using their advice and counsel in caring for our cats for YEARS and have always been satisfied and impressed with the extra care they have received at Aloro. We had been through most, if not all, of the vet clinics in the Studio City/Valley Village area previously and there was always something that didn't feel right with each one. Not the case at Aloro - everything has been great!</review>

<Text>Beautiful, bright offices, large waiting room with many informative posters, large exam rooms... And most professional staff.  I've been a client for about 17 years.  Dr. Dogra is top notch, and having many staff members  working there for most of the time I've know them tells a lot about the family-like environment there.  We always feel welcome, and it's great to just stop by and say hello without having a medical issues with our dog.<//Text>< gmapID>

My cat needed a pedicure. She didn't have an appointment, but they took her in. We didn't wait long and a (temporarily) soft-pawed kitty emerged. Staff is very competent, helpful, and friendly. Waiting area is clean and comfortable. Claw clipping has gone up in price and is kind of expensive. Btw, same price is charged even more work is done, e.g., examination,  blood work, etc.<//Text>

<text>Amazing clinic, so much so that I awoke in the middle of night remembering how much they did for my dog Lobo with his injury And mindful of finance they did not let that deter them from giving Lobo a little extra that went a long way to speedingnhos recovery.
Lobo is here today because of them And I and my family are extremly grateful. I will bring in my other dog Morgan for his needs as well<//text><username>Donovan Villamil-carrillo< /username><userid>103937778138634244892</userid>< time>

We've been taking our animals (our 2 dogs and 1 cat) to Aloro Pet Clinic for almost 9 years. They have always taken excellent care of our pets, they know our animals by name, they provide gentle care of our furry babies and have always given then excellent treatment whenever they've had their annual shots, and/or have needed surgery. I have every confidence in them and wouldn't take our pets anywhere else.  Even though we moved out of the neighborhood last year, THIS is still where we will bring our pets! When you build that kind of trust, it would be too hard to bring them anywhere else.  They are worth the trip!  I highly recommend them and their services.</text>

Left metal sutures in my dog after her spay to indicate she was spayed. Barbaric. Refused to answer questions. Advised I could use an e collar they later claimed was inadequate. These people did not give her adequate pain medication for major surgery. I would not advise you spay your dog with these savages.< /text>

Have always gotten great care here. I like that I am given all my treatment options and costs upfront. Dr. Dogra appears to be a caring doctor who wants 9nly the best for the animals under his care. I have gotten a personal phone call from him with test results.</Text>

Just recently our dog got hit by a car and sadly passed away. As a way to help us grieve a family friend gave us a puppy as a gift. We took our new dog and we informed them of the situation with our old dog. A few days later a card arrived for the clinic expressing their condolences. Not only are they friendly but they also show that they care for the past patients. 10/10 would recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

My dog Stanley and I appreciate the love and care Stanley receives from Aloro.   Stanley is still alive and kicking because of the medical attention he gets.   He actually cries when we pull up in the parking lot.  He can't get out of the car fast enough to run in and see Dr. Young and her crew!

There is never more than a five minute wait and there always seems to be a spot for Stanley on the schedule.</Text>

<Text>I had two doggies for 17 years (Diego and Muñeca) and Aloro was their primary care vet location.  The staff was always friendly and very caring.  I was always greeted and sent off with a warm friendly smile.  I knew that no matter what happened to my pets, Aloro would be there to make them feel better.  The doctors and staff always remembered my dogs and seemed to genuinely care for them. I appreciate everything they ever did for my two pooches, who are no longer with me. I strongly recommend this pet clinic. While prices are certainly not cheap, I do understand it's a business and unlike one review I saw here of 1 star for pricing, I think it's unfair to rate them that way when their service and attention to care is what really matters at the end of the day. Thank you Aloro Pet Clinic for all you did for Diego and Muñeca... I know they too felt at home every time I brought them.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I absolutely love Aloro.  I rescued my pup (Koda) three years ago and the shelter recommended Aloro for her spay operations and she also needed two of her teeth pulled the same day.  They took excellent care of her!  I ended up sticking with them.  The office is clean, super friendly and intimate.  They genuinely feel like your neighborhood vet.  The doctors I have interacted with are knowledgeable, gentle, thorough, and always answers all of my questions.  I moved out of the Valley to the city a few months ago but I still make the drive to Aloro.  They also offer 50% off vet checkups for rescued/adopted pets.  They are the best and I absolutely trust them with Koda's life and health!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Dr. Dogra,

My wife and I want to thank you from our hearts for the wonderful care you gave to both Buddy, our cat, and to us as well. You are truly a veterinary doctor who cares about the animals and owners that come into your care.

You were very clear in your communication about procedures, costs, and options. You saved us money and discounted fees where you were able and we never felt pressured in the least to commit to any procedure or cost. You even gave us the option of home care, which may seem daunting to some, but was manageable with you and your staff’s great instruction.

I also noticed that you keep abreast of the latest veterinary technologies and treatments by attending clinics and meetings - when I learned of that I was very impressed.

Also, our initial visit with Dr. Jen Young was equally excellent. She is a great addition to your team.

And when the end came for our dear companion, you were as compassionate and accommodating as we could hope for and made that transition as comfortable as possible.

So, thank you, and may your practice flourish. If and when there’s a new furry friend in our future, we will be coming to see you for all of our pet’s needs.<//Text>< Pictures>

We've been taking our pets to Aloro for many, many years.  It's a bright, clean space.  They are a wonderful, caring group of people. Sochi, who's been there forever, is amazing.  She's been so thoughtful and caring towards our pets over the years. Dr. Garha is a wonderful vet.  This is one of the best pet clinics in the Valley.<//review>

I discovered this clinic a few years ago when I had I needed an emergency appointment for my cat, and they were so accommodating. I haven't been to any other vet's office since! Both Dr. Young and Dr. Dogra are knowledgable,  compassionate, and professional. The front desk staff are always very nice and helpful in person and on the phone. I have been in touch with them frequently the past few weeks as my kitty is reaching "senior citizen" age, and I am always impressed with the prompt phone calls I receive from the doctors. Thank you all at Aloro for your kind services :)< /Review>

2 years ago I came and they Over charged me for over the counter meds, and they pretended to do a blood test on my pet! And charged me over 200 dollars. No good, I'm for ever disappointed with this business, check your meds may be you can get them over the counter for way, way cheaper price that these people who take advantage of the care and love you have for your pet!<//text>

<Text>My regular awesome Doctor Sharpe was out on deserved vacation, his office sent me here to Aloro.  We returned home from a weekend get away to find Roxy in a lot of ear pain.  I barely finished the visit paperwork and I was into see the kind Dr. Dogra. I knew from past experience with Roxy having had a foxtail stuck in there that she would need to be sedated to rule that out.  The doctor put me at ease and let them lead Roxy away.  Being the dog owner I am, I called early to see how things went.  The front desk people remembered me and after a second on hold the doctor picks up to let me know everything went better than expected and I could come earlier than anticipated. Roxy is home and healing.  Thanks Aloro</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c29606e76786dd:0xd7a76dc72b43e319< /gmap_id></record>

We have two dogs and several cats that we've been bringing there for several years, now, after we left our last unsatisfactory vet; our littlest dog had to have knee surgery last fall, and they did an excellent job, both with the surgery and with the follow-up check-ups and treatment, and he's completely recovered now and walking without any limp or pain like he used to have.  We trust Dr. Dogra as a vet with integrity who knows how to treat the animals in his care.</text>

This place was recommended by a reputable source but didn't think I had to ask for a specific vet to get a proper care. The staff at the front is good. But went here for a quick prespecription pick up for topical cream that should have cost $10 for a ringworm prevention cream that the other vet's office didn't have at the time. Walked out with a $100+ bill and no topical cream for ringworm prevention. Instead, I was pressured to do a different care for my animal and the vet lied to me when I asked about the medication. I specifically needed antifungal and the vet gave anti-bacterial. It's not okay that a care like Dr. Singh's exist: you shouldn't be able to trick you patient, make them feel bad/manipulate a vulnerable situation and LIE to customers when they ask you about the medication.

Also, I think you should be ashamed that you think it's okay to charge $18.00 for a plastic cone that doesn't fit right on a tiny kitten. If you don't like animals or have compassion for people, go take a different profession.<//review><Rating>1<//Rating>< response>

I wanted to move from Los Angeles to other state, but I am scared that I won't get doctors like this anywhere else, so I decided to stay here only in L.A.  I tried other clinics also,  but they all ripped my pockets and my dogs never got proper treatment.  Thank god,  I found DR. DOGRA'S Aloro pet clinic.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I brought my Bichon Friese ,TATI  !! , to Aloro Pet Clinic by a referral.  He started whimpering  Thursday  night and kept me awake with  concern because I didn't  know why.  He's So Healthy. All the staff here we so helpful and kind. Dr. Jen was gentle ,thorough,  and sincere in her treatment  of him. We think it's  a sore muscle from a new larger puppy in the mix. But, will do more blood work on him ASAP. LOVE THIS CLINIC! !<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>The Aloro Clinic, Dr. Dogra and the entire staff is amazing! We brought our 11 year old French Mastiff in because all of a sudden she couldn't put pressure on her front legs. The assistants couldn't have been more sensitive to her needs. Within Minutes Dr. Dogra entered the examination room and diagnosed the problem. We were fortunate that it wasn't anything serious. Dr. Dogra is the veterinarian you want to treat your animals! Thank you Aloro Clinic< /Review>< Pics>

I have been with Dr Dogra since 2011. My family has been with Dr Dogra at Aloro pet clinic even longer, since 2001. Our entire family has always respected, and admired Dr Dogra for the fact when I have brought our Dogs into the clinic I've always felt a sense from Dr Dogra he truly cares about the well being of our dogs. Another fact is I trust Dr Dogra and have peace of mind because he is knowledgeable in his practice. He has compassion for both our dogs and myself as the owner. His prices are fair and Aloro gives to the community by offering discounted rates. I can only ponder how terrific it would be if Dr Dogra was a physician for people.
Sincerely
Jordan Davis<//text>

We started going to Aloro Pet Clinic in 2008. Dr. Dogra is just the best and his staff are the friendliest. Dr. Dogra is the most knowledgable, compassionate and caring vet that we had ever taken our little "Chini", our beloved Maltese that we had for 16 years. She was always well taken care of by Dr. Dogra and his wonderful technicians and staff members. Dr. Dogra does not rush his appointments. His diagnosis was always thorough and he takes time explaining any situation and is very patient with answering questions. He took the best care of our Chini for nearly 10 years. I always felt so comfortable going to Aloro, they became my good friends and I will always cherish all the love they gave to my Chini, myself and the rest of my family.</text>

I had all four of my tires replaced and a TPMS sensor replaced as well. They explained everything to me and even kindly removed the mails from my old tires so that I could take them home to workout with.
We'll definitely be back. Thank you again.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Outstanding customer service, very fast service and clean waiting lounge with a Keurig coffee maker and filtered water dispenser.

On another visit, I booked an appointment for a 11 AM service and I wasn't able to keep the appointment due to circumstances. I called around 3 PM to ask if I can still come in for the service,  and Kevin said come on right in.👍👍<//Review>

I’ve been to many other pep boys, and the employees/ service is always slow and inadequate. The employees at the Jefferson location are amazing and always willing to help/ explain everything. They always have my car done in a speedy time, and always making sure we get the best price. I feel great about coming back here and recommend them to any friends/family that live in the area. Kevin and Brian are always the ones to help me out at the front and they both need raises. Very professional and friendly every single time I’ve been in.< /text>< userid>

The service was quick and everyone offered service with a smile. The service bays were clean and well organized. With that said I will definitely be bringing all my cars here for oil changes.

Came to this location today about 30 min before closing. I needed a tire due to having a screw in the side wall. My hopes of  getting it done were slim or so I thought.
Kevin the assistant manager came to the front. And though the store waa closing Kevin did not hesitate to help me.
Took the car back and looked for a tire.  Mind you the closest one was at the other store. He could have told me to come back the next day. But did he? No way. He send a store employee to get the tire. Mind you this was now after closing. The employee brought the tire back and put it in the car and I was done.
I have not ever encountered such helpful people. Kevin is Amazing and genuine. Please go to have work done at this location. All I can say is wow!! And thank you.

The manager Sal is very nice and very helpful, he explains everything in detail so that it is easily understandable. Same with the other guys. And since pep boys has a good reputation, I leave satisfied that the repairs have been genuinely fixed.

<text>I called about snow chains which they wanted $170.00 and was told they charge 20% fee if returned. Seriously?  For putting them back on the shelf? What an unfair and ridiculous policy. I got same at O'Reilly for $100 with no fee return policy. This place just lost a customer permanently.< /text>< pictures>

I had an appointment but things changed. I called and asked if I can drop my car off and was told that they would try to get it on the rack. Well 6 hours later nothing was done. I’m not upset about it I understand. When I went to pick up my car the lady in front of me was very upset. They did not install a part right and caused damage to her car. I will not take my car here anymore.< /Text>

service only Pep Boys without a store making this one of the best places I have found in the area for bringing your car to get serviced. The manager Sal is knowledgeable about vehicles and their needs since they are a Fleet service center.< /review>

Went in for a tire repair, they said they fixed it and a week later the same tire had a leak in the same spot that was originally leaking air. Took it to another pep boys and they said that nothing was done AND the placement was not repairable. Have tried calling several times and always the same no answer.
Not an honest or reliable place to get your car serviced!!< /Review>

Second time I've been told they could not help me because they don't have a"master technician" on site. Very frustrating after making an appointment, taking time off and just being told to go to another location.</Text>

This store is amazing, the staff are awesome. Elizabeth was so great, she explained everything in detail and we hit it off immediately. The manager, Lina,  was equally as great. They helped me get an amazing deal. I can't believe how great they are and how sweet all of the staff is. Thank you Elizabeth and Lina  for the great deal.< /review>

<review>I called in prior to my visit and the customer service was great to the least of my expectations after I had been having a nightmare ordeal with at&t... Lina the manager made me feel a bit more at ease and assured they would their best to work with our situation and make sure we were happy in transferring over to them - We visited the store the next day and were greeted promptly,  courteous - I had asked for Lina specifically considering she was familiar with my circumstances and I didn't want to repeat myself to much in dreading.. In long story short, I feel they are owed at least of a review - They were very detailed and clear in servicing our needs and understanding our needs as well as a customer.. They are very detail oriented and relaxed, I didn't feel rushed or pressured as just another number in sales.. They treated us as they want to be treated. The vibe is comforting and sociable. I didn't dread being in the store during our visit. This trip was well worth my time and hassle free.. and the store is super clean!! Thanks for the deals and taking care of us well

Thank You Lina, Elizabeth & Staff!! 🙌 You Rock

Keep Up the Awesome Service, Thank You for everything you all did to provide the phenomenal service to keep us sane and you saved us money

Your New Customer for Life 🤗<//review>< Pictures>

It was Bobby's first day but he did such a great job with me and listened to everything I had to say. Rudy was helping Bobby and also gave us excellent customer service. I definitely prefer coming to this location over the Sherwood one! Lina is always very helpful too, I love all the staff here. They have great customer service and will talk to you with respect unlike Sherwood.< /review>

The staff at this store is AMAZING. We got in here at closing time and they helped us out with no problem. They are so nice and helpful that I would definitely come back here to get any service done with my line. Dante, Janicee, and Rudy are the people to go to. If you ever need help with your services or phone, I highly recommend coming to this place.<//Text>

Wanted an upgrade and new service provider while in California for work, but the phone I really wanted wasn't in stock.. I was informed that they can set up my service and have the IPhone shipped overnight, Elizabeth and Robert explained everything very well and were also friendly. If your in the Stockton ares definitely come to these guys,  the entire staff is amazing.</Text>

This is, by far, my favorite T-mobile store to go into in Stockton. Every time I need help with something, be it upgrading my phone or adding on a line, Lina is an extraordinary help. I recently added a line to my phone and she helped me through the process and even was able to help me keep the number I wanted, she was great! i highly recommend this T Mobile location!</text>

I went to T-Mobile in the Weberstown Mall today 2/16 to pay my bill and Jazell was a total Doll! Super personable and handled my payment FAST! After my bill I decided to look at phones to upgrade a line and Lina was very knowledgeable and wasn't pushy at all with any suggestions. I happily made a decision and while waiting for her to get the items Marlisa began my transaction and paperwork. It was insanely easy, FAST and fun! They were all so happy and explained everything I needed to know and of course promoted deals I was eligible for without pressure. THANK U LADIES!!! <3</review>

<Review>Amanda spends half of the time texting on her phone while helping the customers very poor customer service. She didn’t pay attention to half of the things I would say she was just trying to rush us out of the store so she can leave.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80900c5437ab38f3:0xb13b6987b8069aca<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I feel like I get great service every time I could in and there is a lot of things going on but it goes quick. I always get offered great deals and they are great to push them because it informs us as opposed to not telling us and we miss out on something we want.
Dante and Janicee were very real with me and were very honest about the promotion and sale and I appreciated it.
I would recommend Dante and Janicee and even the store 100% for any of your cell phone needs.< /Text>< Pictures>

I broke my iPhone 7 and went there to claim the insurance but they suggested  me to fix the screen for cheap price from the cart infront of their store named five star. After some days the phone’s touch isn’t working and they want more money to fix it again. I heard their conversations of getting some commision from that cart. Totally waste of money and time.<//review>

<Text>This was hands down the best visit I ever had to T-Mobile.  My experience at the Manteca location has always been terrible.  Dante and Jazell demonstrated their mastery of customer service.  Dante was knowledgeable, helpful and was very welcoming.  He offered great recommendations based on our needs and even took the time to hand write our bill break down.  He is an absolute asset to this company, and I heartily recommend this store to anyone if the other representatives can live up to his example.< /Text>< pics>

I had trouble finding out whether or not I had insurance on my phone and was extremely frustrated because it needs to be replaced , but with the help of Dazhane , I was put at ease. She was very calm and helpful to me and assured me that I in fact was insured and simply needed to get a warranty for my phone . She has great customer service skills!!! Thank you Dazhane for helping me !!!</Text>

Jazell Amador Welcomed Me As Soon As I Walked Into The Store. Super Friendly And Good At Giving Details On The Phones I Asked On. I Need To Upgrade Fast Since My Phone Is A Low End Phone. She Recommended Me The Samsung J7 Was A,Good For Its Price. Then Asked On The High End Phones. She Personally Recommended Me The LG V20, Over The Samsung Edge 7 On Price. Just What A Customer Wants To Hear. So Now I Have An Appointment Next Weekend To UpGrade Out Of The Samsung J7, Maybe The LG V20, Or Samsung S7. Decisions????<//text>

I went to Gary to get some of my overseas business documents apostilled. He got my docs apostilled much sooner than the ETA he had provided. More importantly, he was very familiar with what docs were needed for my situation and freely shared that information that saved a lot of time for me. In summary, he went above and beyond my expectations to deliver excellent service.< /review>

I admire this place! They offer excellent dishes, their menu is nice, The chief cook in that spot is a specialist, I like a lot eating all their food. The dishes are always fresh, the attitude towards the visitors  is agreeable. I  go often to this place and I not even once was disappointed. Highly recommended.</Text>

<review>I visited Saturday morning. Was happy that they had a sausage McMuffin deal, 2/$4, my wife and I were able to eat under $10. Drive through line was long, and I thought it was a little slow. But the service was friendly and the food was good. So it was worth the wait.</review>< pictures>

<username>Precious Wiggins</username><Date>1615265312437< /Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>March 6, 2021~Horrible customer service. We came in the drive thru, listed our meal which were individual items off the menu, then ordered a meal. The woman taking the order wrote it down correctly and asked if our order was correct and we said yes. When we went to the window they gave us the absolute wrong order and we tried to explain but they wouldn't hear. The manager was there and wouldnt hear us out at first then got an attitude and told us we were wrong when we finally explained and tried to give us another meal which i assume was from another car's order but she didnt even bother trying to look and figure it out she just assumed she was correct and ran with it. We ordered food for 3 people and they gave us a food for 1 person so we knew for a fact it wasnt our order but instead of asking us to wait so they could figure it out the manager said they were right and decided to juss give us our money back. If your business where you have to deal with customers the least you can do is make sure you giving the correct food to the correct people and admit when your wrong.<//Text>< Pics>

Very clean and efficient McDonald's in Cal City. We stopped for breakfast on the way to our campsite and ordered inside. The only negative is that the bathrooms aren't open for customers.< /Review>

If this is the one in California City, how are you open( the only one) and you have no bathroom.  You are sending your customers to The adjacent Rite Aid. How beneath You. And as a crew member what does the turquoise shirt represent...hell of laziness.  That fat odd shape blob in Turquoise is the laziest shiftless manager I ever encountered.  She saw me and literally just act like I didn't exist. You bloated teletubby. U should of stayed home. No 👎 stars.< /Text>

<text>I have lived here in Cal City since October if 2019. I waited to post this to give the restaurant a fair chance and give a quality meal. Vey sub-par even for a McDonalds. The only thing that I really enjoy here is the coffee. Sadly, I have not bought a solid hamburger from this spot. My last encounter (Tuesday, 9Feb21), I purchased a bacon cheeseburger and was less than satisfied. The patty was burnt and dry, seemed like it was hours old. Finally, the meal took about 8 minutes from the time I got to the second window. The timeline would seem as if it is being cooked to order, but the end product is far from it.

However, even though the food is not good, the employees are nice, I have not had a bad encounter.

I really do hope that this branch starts to take more pride in its food. After speaking to people from all around town, they think the same thing as mentioned above, sub-par at best. If there is not an improvement, or another fast food restraunt is opened up here, then I dont see this branch being very profitable.</text>< Pics>

0 stars!!!! Waited in drive through forever...then got the order wrong! How hard is it...took 40mins. If it wasn't the only drive-thru in California City I would never go back. Pay them $15.00 an hour are you kidding me!!!!<//Review>

They always say “ I have the right to not take your order” when all you do is ask them to be polite... not with a attitude. The managers don’t act like mangers in the store ... it’s the employee who makes it seem like they are running the place.< /Review></record>

< Review>
This McDonald's has been close and reported to the orange county health department for not following the coronavirus guidelines.

Aside from not being able to follow local health mandates this McDonald's serves the most horrible and horrific food in California. The drinks are never fixed the soda machine is always broken, the food is always old and it's always disgusting. The staff is rude, they get into arguments with the customers at the drive-through window at the point with the customers have to leave. Your entire afternoon staff that works right now is totally in capable of serving three cars in a line and preparing actual food for them.

You need to replace the manager that works during this period. She has no skills to resolve a customer complaint, and thought she barely gave me my money back. She didn't apologize for the condition of her operation or anything she just gave me the money back after I had to Yellit her because she didn't want to. I'm sorry you're not gonna give me a refund because you gave me a soda that is flat and chicken nuggets that are two hours old? Save your money and go to different McDonald's until this McDonald's realizes that They can't be rude and nasty and serve nasty food at the same time and demand money.<//Review>

<Review>The cashier was really sweet but the manager was rude until she was bored and needed someone to talk to about her pain and work related injury 🙄 she didn't let the cashier check to see if they had other toys for the happy meal when I mentioned that my son had 2 of the one they had. I mean, come on! You're in the middle of nowhere! You definitely have the other toys in the collection there 🤣 she was like, you can't buy just the toys! Yeah, I have a toddler and I'm hungry too! If she would have let the girl look and they had what I needed, I would have bought more 🤷🏻‍♀️<//Review>< rate>

Probably the worst McDonalds I’ve ever been to. Every time I go there something is messed up. They’ve only been accepting cash payment for almost 2 weeks now... why haven't they fixed it? I just went there and the sign said “only exact cash payments and card payments” but they werent taking card, and then I only had a $20 so I tried to order close to $20, and I pulled up and they said that they were in fact giving change even though the sign said otherwise.... They also werent serving fries or dessert. There’s always something out of order. A couple of weeks ago it was the soda machine. The food tastes OLD all the time; the people in Cal City probably think this is normal but it’s NOT! The fries and nuggets taste like they’ve been sitting out, and sometimes they’re cold. The service is also very slow even though the food tastes like it’s sitting out. It’s upsetting because it’s the only place that’s open late at night, but this is unacceptable. Something needs to change. Raise your standards!!!< /Text>

Great wines and beer. Excellent happy hour! Menu could step it up a bit--there's a certain blandness to the palette, perhaps because they don't want the food to overpower the wine.<//Text>

<review>I am so tired of getting food from McDonald's that is messed up. I dont know what their problem is working there. I got Big Mac with no onions and my husband got Double Quarter Pounder with no ketchup. My burger just cheese and meat patty. My husband has lots and lots of mustard. Guess they think that he needs more mustard because of no ketchup. Look for my photos.< /review>< resp>

San Juan Capistrano history, with a modern, but cowboy flair. Good wine, for sure (you must try their Mexican Coffee!), but good food too.< /text>

Literally everytime I have been to the McDonald's in California City,  they have messed up my order with one or more items.
If they werent the only business open in town after 9pm, they would be closed down and outta business.

<Review>Update: My son wanted to try the new Crispy Chicken Sandwiches. We ordered one of each. The Deluxe came the same as the regular, no tomatoes or pickles. And they definitely didn't look like the advertisement. Disappointed as usual. Not sure why we continue to waste our money 🤔

<review>We go here all the time. Usually drive thru or pick up service. In the last 10 years I can't even think of one instance where staff wasn't wonderfully friendly. They have new faces often, and sometimes they forget to tell new folks how to tell if an order is curbside, but I always get what I order with a smile.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

No that's not a fluke that's five stars. A lot of people think that they don't deserve five stars because there's usually a line wrapped around the parking lot for drive-thru. But if you go inside the service is quick, way quicker than the drive-thru and friendly. I bet you if more people went inside the drive-through would be a lot less packed and stressful</review>

Very simple order. Requested a Nicky D's egg and sausage McMuffin. Ended up opening it when I was on the road and guess what? Missing the egg ugh. Learning to listen is a special skill and pushing a button. Will add that the order taker was quite congenial good personality. Wish she had gotten my order right! Maybe next time.<//Text>

I can't really complain about the food, because I never reached the counter. I only saw two employees, and the line was 12 people long. This is the second time I've come here and had to wait for service. I won't be back.< /review>

<review>The Lady Mexican Manager was rude just was in town for 1hr only place in town to get a quick bite to eat only had $100 bill in my wallet and really didn't want to use card and she rudely asked how much was my order but i guess i didn't spend enough for her to break it! Come on now this a billion 💵 company Who never refuses any amount of money! Some people just don't deserve jobs serving the pubic! Funny i stop eating McDonald's due to my diet and just wanted a triple cheese burger and a Coke! Well i got the coke guess I'll wait until next year for the triple cheese 🍔 😂 Thx for the wonderful customer service! Pinks here i come all the way from California City i guess if im going to cheat i may as well go all the way 😂<//review><gmap_id>0x80c22ce4e1fd96d5:0x4a18d449e1924e5d<//gmap_id><Rating>1<//Rating>< user_id>

Not the first time I’ve had an issue with this location. They always mess something up, if not the whole order. Went through the drive through and ordered a buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich with no mayo. Took forever to get my food and when I got it, not only was there mayo on it, but a bite taken out of it!! I couldn’t believe it. A whole bite already eaten out of my burger. How disgusting! Took it back in and turns out it was someone else who had brought their food back for being messed up, and they had mixed it up on the counter with the other food. They didn’t compensate me in any way, just made an excuse for why it happened and said sorry. Me having previous management experience, along with common sense, tells me that whenever food leaves the restaurant, and then is brought back, is supposed to go in the trash. Someone could have brought back a 2 day old burger from the backseat of their car and it still would have been given to a customer. That’s unacceptable. Period. There is no excuse and nothing that can validate why they would give out or mix up food that was already bitten out of and returned. Period. It’s obvious that they are not following any of the appropriate health procedures or policies. Could only imagine what else they fail to comply with behind the counter that customers can’t see.<//Text>

I would rate the Cal City McDonald's as zero stars but I can't I have to at least give them one. I went through the drive-thru today and they totally screwed up my order. Then when they tried to fix it they screwed it up again and was missing french fries so I had to talk to the manager twice in the manager was arguing with me saying that it wasn't their fault and I said you're the one running the drive-thru. LOL anyway I would rather go to Jack In The Box at Mojave it's a little cheaper and the food is just as good if not better but with a lot better service Tumi customer service is the most important in getting the order right specially to the drive-thru.<//text>

I like stopping at this McDonald's because of the dollar menu items. The last time I was there I had a cheeseburger with no pickles and a small fry and a drink. They got the order completely correct, it was hot and the order was completed quickly. The area you sit down at was clean, the staff was friendly and it was an enjoyable experience. So if you need to stop for a quick snack or something quick for your kids this is your place.</Text>

I myself now a days only order the 2/$4 sausage egg mcmuffin. So today it had a piece of egg shell in it which made it awful. But my daughter's was delicious. So still give them 5 stars because 1 mess up doesn't account for all the other times we've gone. Plus great customer service. It's also kept clean!<//Text>

I was disappointed with the service as well as with the food. I ordered a 20 piece chicken nugget meal and they were cold and seemed like they've been sitting there for hours. I ordered fresh nuggets and got the same thing. The customer service was lousy and can improve because the wait was ridiculous!  And there were not that many people in the restaurant.< /text>

There has been some kind of issue everytime I've gone for the last 6 or 7 times.. it's always either,  an employee isn't trained right and does something for me but when I go back again I cant have the same customer order. Or how about when they just get your whole order wrong and you drive home with someone else's order. Or when you just pull up to grab a few drinks and get asked to pull around and park for 10mins while you wait on some coffee.. like come on, get your act together. I'm definitely NOT loving it.. I expect your ice cream machine to be down but all this other stuff just seems unnecessary..

Your employees, wack
Your food, wack
Your managers, wack
The way you treat your customers, wack
The way you assemble your food, wack
The way you arent consistent, wack
Your whole thing is wack

We need a taco bell or better yet a healthy food spot here in cal city. Anything but McDonalds..

I'll never eat there again.. plus EVERYONE I know can make a better burger then yall and for way less health concern...</text>

<review>Doesn't deserve any stars! I waited 22 minutes for 2 coffees. Time based on the time on my order receipt and refund receipt. 3 people filling orders for drive thru 5 people making food 1 person at the counter. Apparently no one can make coffee. Neither the employees or the manager were the least bit apologetic. Final straw with this McDonald's! Won't be going back. Fastrip is quicker nd the employees are friendlier!  So sad that this is the best Cal City can do.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

what can I say?  It's freakin' McDonald's people. it's the exact same thing no matter where you are. it's as if the have highly advanced organic material cloning machines in ever McDonald's on the planet. All these machines are linked via the American Secret Strategic Data Analysis and Response Team. A*S*S* D*A*R*T*
This enables every individual location based clone clown to perfectly replicate any menu item by sampling genetic code and bio-variables from dozens of McD's simultaneously. Ensuring that the taste of every menu item will be exactly what you taste no matter where, no matter what.<//Text>

Ordered a hot mocha and drive through, after pulling up because of long line I tasted no mocha just coffee, when I tried to get someone attention inside because it was after inside dining was closed, the manager inside would not help or even address my problem so got discussed and vacated establishment. And to make matters worse I'm disabled.< /Review>

<text>It's a typical McDonald's.   Same menu , same tastes.  However.  The drive thru is slow.  Not just slow, but, snails move faster!  I dont recommend this particular store if you are in a hurry.  That being said, the drive thru staff have all been very, very nice.<//text>< Time>

Really bad service I had ordered on the kiosk because you can't use card at the counter. They call my number I had put for sit down. I pucked it up not a huge deal. Went back up to the counter to get ketchup stood there with people walking by me behind the counter that could see me clear as day never acknowledged me  I said excuse me can I please get some Ketchup before my food is cold. Also couldn't find a single clean table. I grew up in this town and seen McDonald's go through alot of changes here but this is the worst it has been.< /Text>

I ordered a medium meal, and pancakes almost came to 16 bucks. First they forgot my fries, then they had my sandwich all wrong. And then the fries they gave me after forgetting were cold and mushy..but customer service was respectful and kind.< /text>

Decent. Could use improvement with some of the employees attitudes, and running short on items. It's advantage is that it's the only one in the city. More workers on the weekends.< /text>

California City, California  McDonald's service has gotten alot slower and I dread going there. The drive thru takes longer than any other, the service inside is takes even longer. Then they advertise the kiosk like it's the best thing ever, they're confused about it, leaving the customer confused. Today, it took close to 20 min after ordering to when I got my food, 15 min waiting on some of my order and then another 4 to 5 min for the rest of my order.<//text>

<text>The manager was VERY RUDE! I BOUGHT A HAMBURGER THAT WAS OLD, TASTED RANSID , VERY BAD!
In stead of apologizing , she said well you brought it back 15 minutes later, WHAT!? I SAID.
SHE MADE ME WAIT IN THE DRIVE THRU FOR 20 MINUTES. I TOLD HER TO KEEP THE BURGER & THE $. SHE WAS TO DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH & SHOULD NOT BE IN A FORUM OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, HER SKILL'S WERE OFF!!!< /text>< pictures>

Horrible. I ordered through the app, and didn't realize they have me the wrong order until I got home and was ready to eat
I has to drive back handed them the bag with all the food including the fries. They fixed my order and expect me to eat cold fries. I told the guys I wasn't eating cold fries and to please replace them. It sucks we won't have many fast food  options her I'm Cal City.< /Text>

Received my order 10 minutes after placing it in the drive thru. Had to wait 3 minutes while the manager & the vehicle in front of me had a personal conversation that I was able to listen to. Service at this location has always slow but today was the worst.<//Text>

SUPER slow drive thru! I have never left a review on anything on this app but i was compelled to as I've been sitting in this drive thru for 25 minutes and still have a car ahead of me
**Update** almost a year later(because that's how poor of a service these "wonderful people" offer) website says they close at 1A.M. everyday and I show up at 12:04 as the last one in line and they refuse service to me.
The employees are nice.
The supervisors and managers are rude and incompetent.</text>

<review>Tried to call over 10 times in the past 3 days and all during a low peak time and nobody has EVER answered the phone. I mean what gives, isnt that your job as a business to answer the phone.  Wonder if McDonald's who is backi g the store with its name knows business is ran as such.</review>< user>

Wait was a few minutes longer than expected but food was hot, fresh and they threw in a medium fry for free for the wait. Before you ask I didn't say anything about the wait. They just put the fry in and said it was for the wait.<//review>

<review>I ordered from the drive thru tonight and clearly ordered my regular  bacon mcdoubles and fries. i normally ask for my fries fresh but forgot so I get to the window and ask the young man if he could make them fresh so he reads me my order but says mcdoubles .....i didn't order mcdoubles, I ordered bacon mcdoubles. so the staff clearly had an attitude especially after my sister spoke up about it. we got our food and I get dropped off all the way home when I start eating my fries....... they are crunchy, over cooked. and I honestly believe this was purposely done. smh poor McDonald's brand not being represented the way it should. I know this business didn't get this far off of this type of foolishness, so whoever thought it be okay to serve me those fries I hope whoever your boss is deals with you and those who allowed you to serve over cooked fries to a customer. a loyal one at that.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c22ce4e1fd96d5:0x4a18d449e1924e5d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Lived here 2 years and every single time I've been has been a super long wait and they have never gotten our order correct. They wouldn't even take a coupon from their own website. Rudest manager I've ever dealt with. I was literally ready to come over the counter for the way I was talked to. I am done. I will drive to another town before buying there again.<//review>

One of my two Egg McMuffins was cold. And it was the first one that I ate. I was charged 2 times what a normal McDonald's would charge. I spill my drink there was no offer to refill it. I used one of their buy one get one free coupons and was still charged their full price full price. Service was extremely slow. Not a place to frequent often.< /Review>

Even after the new look, it doesn't look as open n comfortable as previous. The service isn't any better, plus it is usually very cold in there. The handicapped bathroom had no TP n the trash bin was about to overflow. All this on an evening that wasn't very busy. Sorry!< /text>

<text>Updated: 5/02/2019: Good food.....great service! Nice to see food served to elderly who have problems getting up and down. They've replaced the card swipers back to the counter! Only one issue .... and that other customers have.... the smell from the bathrooms.They need vents put in. The methane buildup is getting bad.

Updated 11/10/17:  Guess they read my last review. So the entire lobby was remodeled including the bathrooms. Now just get the card swipers in so you can take debit/credit< /text><UserId.>116513249544881421913</UserId.>< resp>

Service has sucked every time I've been there and how about you get your store hours right online? Because when I checked, it said you guys were 24 hours but you were closed when I went to get food at 11:00PM. Idiotic.<//text>

I went to the drive through at 12 am and theyre supposed to be open until 1 am, well look who refused to answer me at the speaker!! How rude. When I clearly saw 5 employee cars parked and saw at least 1 employee with the mic head set. Terrible night crew I must say.< /Review>

<Text>I had no issues cruising through their drive-thru. There was a large volume of customers  from a nearby event, and I don't feel like the wait was too long. The cashier was very chipper and friendly. The food was exactly what you would get at any other location.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Forget stopping here if there are more then 2 cars in the drive thru. Painfully slow service does not translate into better attention to your order. Something will be lacking in the order, and very few of the empolyees seem to understand they are in the customer service industry. Very very disappointing.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>*Warning: Half filled fries, "order changing", and they will peel a meat patty in half add cheese and call it a mcdouble during peak hours to speed up lines. Which is still very slow. Pay attention ⚠️
*Poorest tasting/constructed mcdoubles I've ever had. Missing onions, tastes like old meat, stacked pickles.. Etc.
*Frappe machine always down.
*Dirty looking employees, no gloves.
*Shutdown ice cream machine for the night hours early.
*Makes me "pull forward" and wait while they walk 2 wrong orders out to my truck during lunch break.<//review>< user_id>

They always seem to get the register right but they do have a problem if they get your order right you might want to double-check if you order the sauce they act like they're paying for it or it's coming out of their paycheck or something to give you an extra sauce of any kind or syrup for your pancakes little kids if you say no pickle on your burger plan on peeling that tickle up there yourself they over cook their burgers and yesterday when the lady handed me my milkshake the lid was loose I didn't drop it thank God but it was it came up and spilled all over in my truck I had just washed my truck I wasn't happy about it and we'll just leave that right there and the future I will ask for a tray or something very irritating< /review>

<review>The service is sluggish and rude at best, the food is prepared sloppily and often times the order is incorrect. The manager needs to see through that friendlier employees are hired and rude crew members are reprimanded, that's if she wasn't incredibly mean herself.< /review>< resp>

<Text>Slowest, most neglectful McDonalds I have ever been to. You wait 30 minutes in the drive thru, and they ALWAYS either miss something or mess up the order. The only reason this place exists is the lack of other fast food restaurants in the area. Pop ANY other fast food place up in the area, and this mcdonalds will go bankrupt.< /Text><Name>Red The Doxie</Name><gmapID>0x80c22ce4e1fd96d5:0x4a18d449e1924e5d< /gmapID><response>None<//response>< user>

<text>They close at 1 am but I was coming back from town late at night around 12 and they didn't take my order at all at the drive through even though they're open. Also I went the next day and I asked for a cheese burger, a regular cheeseburger nothing special. They did not put on cheese or the pickle or the onions. Just bread patty and ketchup.<//text>< Date>
