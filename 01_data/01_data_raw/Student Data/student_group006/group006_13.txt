They've helped me out three times now. Doesn't look very good for my car, but Monrovia Tow Truck always delivers excellent service. Very friendly and professional service and assistance.  I was able to make it to work in no time (my work was surprised I got to work so fast). Excellent experience!  Thank you!!  Fast, friendly, helpful and professional.<//review>

<Review>Wonderful tow service! Fast and safe. Tom put me at ease and went above and beyond to help today. I greatly appreciate the top notch service! He was extremely skilled at using skids to drag my car into the flatbed which he had to drive in reverse to get to me. Very skilled in operating the machine to get my vehicle off at my mechanics. Great job!</Review>< Pics>

Great Service! Shane came to our car when we called AAA. He was very professional and helpful. He changed battery in our car. We had a great time. Driver was a really nice guy,  professional and courteous.  I hope I don't have to use them again, but if I do, I won't hesitate. In fact, I added them to my contacts.<//text>

I was trying to get home after work, when I locked my keys in my car and sure enough I called AAA and they sent driver Richard at Monrovia Tow Truck! shout out to him for coming in a timely manner, checked in with me to let me know how far away he was and let me know he was close. I really appreciated his help tonight. Saved me a lot of headache. Thank you!<//Text>

I had a flat after a road trip, and was looking to get a tow to the nearest dealership for a fix. I called AAA, was quoted 45 minutes until someone came, and James Monrovia Tow Truck was there 15 minutes early. Towed my car safelya t rasonable price and I am so happy with the service and can't wait to recommend these crews.<//Text>

<Text>Very grateful and pleased with his service. Estimated price over phone was indeed the same at the end of the tow. Richard was very friendly and helpful with my car! He helped show me what was wrong and gave me advice on what to do next. It was very heartwarming to see that he wasn't trying to just take my money and go, but instead took the time to be helpful with my car.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1561011630924, 'text': 'THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND WORDS'}</response><gmapID>0x80c2d969cd733aed:0x69f7be03661d9dc9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

James has come to my rescue twice now! Always gets specific location details over the phone then depending on where he is, will head straight to you. He was careful with my car and made sure to have a rapport with me before he left with it. Love the flat rate price he offers! Definitely recommend.</text>

Couldn't be happier with the service. I shopped around all the AAA recommended tow truck services and Monrovia Tow Truck was the most reasonable deal. Waited  the average 30 minutes like usual for any tow truck service. I was in bind being 50 miles from my house and Monrovia Tow Truck came through. Amazing experience.<//review>

Do NOT use this towing service. Originally quoted a price of $89 plus the tire cost which in the phone, supervisor Meadow said “under $200”. Waited over an hour for the truck to come WITHOUT THE TIRE and just to be told he is charging extra for his time to come out. So now it’s up to just under $400!!! When we asked why they said said “we’ll he can charge what’s fair”. Total ripoff. Do not use.< /text>

My friend blew a tire on the 5 and I drove over to help. He was about to call AAA when Monrovia Tow Truck randomly pulled up. He swapped his shredded tire with his spare, no charge!!! Just keeping him safe.</Review>

Do not use this service.  I decided to read the other reviews to see if anyone had a similar experience. I noticed that for any negative review their response was "1 JOB LANDED US 12 BAD REVIEWS FROM FRIENDS"

It's not impossible but pretty farfetched to believe that someone got 11 other friends to join them in review bombing some low tiered tow company. Especially when you look at the reviews and they're all posted at completely different times, some even months apart.

So what that tells me is that these negative reviews have been earned by the tow company itself and not some conspiracy amongst friends.

That being said if you feel like making your bad day even worse then this is definitely the company to waste your time, energy, and money with. Otherwise, you're better off going with literally any other tow company.</review>

First and foremost call someone else customer service and there prices are a joke and a scamI called for a tire replacement I was originally told 89+ the tire cost but that it would be less then 200 overall. Worst experience I’ve ever had with any service of my life they told me 30 mins wait time the driver didn’t even call me until an hr later then I had to wait yet another hour for him to arrive when he did I was told 89 for him just showing up plus 200 for him to change the tire plus what ever the cost of the tire would be which turned out to be 85 for a USED tire I tried calling there dispatch to see about there mix up and the supervisor yes the supervisor called meadow said if I don’t the service then there going to charge me the 89 regardless and refused to give me any more information wouldn’t even confirm the name of the business if I could I wouldn’t even give them a star I advise against using this service</text>

TERRIBLE service, waited over 2 hours and they quoted the wrong price, jacked up the price when the person got here AND when I called back to speak to a manager this girl answers with MAJOR attitude and tells me “the guy (tow driver) can charge whatever he wants”. DO NOT USE MONROVIA TOW TRUCKS FOR ANY REASON.</review>

Don’t waste your money this company doesn’t care about customer service and knows you’re in a bad situation and need help and so they take advantage of you!!! I had a flat tire and they told me it would be 400 for a tow home and not more than 200 to change the tire so I decided to get the tire changed and save money. I told the rude manager on the phone ( she said her name was meadow but I think she was lying because she refused to give me her name) the size of my tire and she told me help would be there in an hour. The man did not show up for two hours and didn’t have a tire!!!! He said he had to go back and get the tire which took another hour and a half!!!! Also he came back with a USED tire and told me with his service fee and the price of the tire it would be nearly 400 !!! They lied to me about price time and they brought me a tire I will have to replace soon! When I tried to complain they were rude to me!!!!<//text>

<text>To start off this shouldn't be considered a star at all. This towing company is a waist of time and money. I waited a little under 2 hours for roadside assistance to arrive. Once upon arrival the assistance gave me a totally different price than what was quoted over the phone yet we would have to wait another hour in a half for him to go back and get the tire we needed. I was upset at this point being that it was 10:30pm and I had work at 3am with an
hour drive to go home. I called up the company spoke to the supervisor by the name of Meadow , who refused to give me her last name,  to inform her what was going on. She was no help at all. Her communicattion towards me was rude. Medow was quickly to inform me that I was not the only one who needed services tonight and said she couldn't help me at all. Wouldn't recommend this even to my worst enemies.<//text>< pictures>

I just called this company and asked if I could get a quote for towing service.   The man's  answer was " We"re not towing today"  When I replied what days do you offer towing services, he hung up on me.  Frankly not a professional.   Don't do business with these amateurs.

Response to Owner of this Joke Business:
This guy answers my post 1 year later arguing it's the wrong company.    Wrong company to do business with, indeed.   And they have no excuse for being rude and hypocritical.  Just take a look at the response time and comments made by these Neanderthals.    Not a smidgeon of originality or sincerity!</Text>

Parlor Wax Co. is seriously the best place in town to go for all of your waxing needs! Jayme is incredibly professional, sweet, and super easy to talk to. She makes the whole experience comfortable and gets the job done quick! They also have a great collection of handmade candles, soaps, and body care products-perfect for gifts! I highly recommend Parlor Wax Co. :)</review>

This was my first time getting a Brazilian wax done and Ana was my waxer. She was very nice and made me feel very comfortable. She explained what she was doing as she was doing it and answered any questions I had. I will definitely be going back and referring my friends!< /text>

My quarantine bush is GONE. The girl who did my brazilian was great. Talked to me throughout and gave me clear expectations as to what to expect (Pain lol) on my initial waxing.
These gals pull long, medium and short strips depending on the crevasse. They pull against th grain so that is a special hurt. But I have had no reaction to the wax and this far (4 days) no itchies or ingrown hairs. I use a summer's eve with a little shuga in it to exfoliate. My only complaint is I wish they had some spa products like a special vaginal scrub or soothing oils. My husband said that this waxing place is like a jiffy lube for wax, and I'd have to agree. I was in and out of there in 15min! Lunch break wax? Yes plz</text>

I am very satisfied with my first professional wax experience at Parlor Wax Co. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for an amazing wax salon. The ladies were so friendly and helpful. I am no longer going to try the do it myself method and opting for getting waxed by these awesome professional ladies.< /review>

I'm so sad I don't live in town just because of how great of a job they did.
The esthetician that I had my appointment with was very friendly and thorough. When I come down to Bakersfield I usually go with EWC and I have to say that this will be my new favorite place to get brazilians. My overall experience was great and I highly recommend anyone looking into getting a Brazilian to choose Parlor Wax Co.</Review>

Everyone is really personable from reception to esthitician. They can usually squeeze you in with a day or two notice barring special occasions or holidays.  They always take care with their services both during and after the wax to ensure theres no ingrown hairs, etc.  For me, top notch quaity every time.  The lobby is welcoming with fun products to peruse while you wait.   Parking is usually terrible, but there is a parking structure a block away.</text>

Daniel is unpleasant. I said a quart then immediately corrected to a gallon.  He misheard and prepare a quart instead of a gallon. Dare to blame me and suggested I speak louder. Then forcefully required that I must purchase the error.  I remembered why U don't shop here. I'll never go back. I only went there to recycle paint.   Sherwin region manager, Steve, called in response to this posting.  He asked and listened to my story. His response was sincere and he offer to remedy.  I change my rating from 1 to 3 stars.< /text>

<text>The first minute a customer walks in they are subconsciously generating impressions of overall service. In the couple minutes I was there I was not greeted, when I went to ask a question everyone stalled. There was two employees behind the desks in the back, why didn't they care to help me? The only person who tried to help me was ALREADY HELPING ANOTHER CUSTOMER. Of course my inquiry wasn't at the top of my priorities, but he answerd my question two times with the same answer, "yeah but it's in the back." The effort wasn't there at all on anyone's part, and the leadership today was non-existent. Seriously you guys?? No excuses.<//text>< pictures>

I would highly recommend to avoid this location at any cost. Selling boxes that cost less than 1$ for 15+ per box is seriously stupid.

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>James was very helpful. I went there to drop off Amazon return packages. I put two labels on one box and 3 items inside. One of the three items has a bar code return label. Amazon customer service told me I could do that, but James told me that  we shouldn’t do that. If we do that, we might not get all the refunds, because the person who opens the package at Amazon might just scan one label.

He opened package and separated and resealed each one individually. I didn’t have to make another trip and all the trouble... especially given the pandemic situation..

Thank you, James.

Kindness can go a long way...  I’ll make sure paying it forward. If we could all strive to be kind to one another, what a wonderful world we and our children would live in.< /Review>< Response>

<Text>They were rude when I dropped something off there, insisted on charging me for packaging when free packaging and shipping is included, and did not provide me with a receipt when I drop off (the sheet of paper they gave me had no valid information on it). I even called the customer service line and they agreed that this is highly unusual.</Text><Time>1615682404823<//Time><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>115713512697157362571< /UserId.><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Couple of things were needed for returns to be processed :
1. Print out the shipping label
2. Apply tape to the package to seal it

Personal at the store were really cordial and took care of both items. And did it for free. Will be my goto place for all returns.</Review>

<review>Michelle was very helpful with notarizing our family trust. She helped figure out what we need to print, printed and sorted all of it for us and assisted us throughout whole process. She was also very mindful about our small child being with us and orchestrated the whole process so my wife and the baby were disturbed the least.</review>< response>

Charged me $3.25 to print a pre-paid shipping label. Outside of this being absurdly expensive, what could have a 30 second interaction became a 5+ minute interaction (email the file, wait for clerk to print, wait for payment to process). What should have happened, show the clerk the label on my phone, scans it, prints it, leave. During peak CoVID-19 levels, this is simply unacceptable.<//text>

This UPS location is very efficient for mailing packages as well as drop-offs. Because they are so quick, there is usually no line when I come in. Once in a while there, I have to wait and am the only person in line. But it's only for a a minute or so because they have lots of staff and multiple weigh stations for packages. A way better experience than the US Post Office.

The biggest issue here is the parking situation on Castro. There is a limited supply of street parking for a multitude of businesses. Save yourself a headache and forget coming at lunch time during the week. Other times it's hit or miss, and it's not fun carrying boxes of stuff for any long distance so good luck there.

That said, there's a Starbucks nearby, so anytime I have to work carrying a package, I can treat myself do a drink there.< /text>

The manager said they are not UPS to avoid taking responsibility. That is funny. Worest UPS store ever.
And one more important bring yur own tape. If you forget that you need to buy it. They will not kindly help you out for free like other UPS stores.< /Text>

<Text>Expensive and staff unprofessional.

I wanted a print out and they said I have to pay computer charges.  This is unheard of because most places let you email the document.

Also I heard the staff making fun of and gossiping about other customers.  This is highly unprofessional.<//Text>< pics>

Friendly staff, they let me enter even past the closing time. Most importantly, they're pretty efficient compared to other locations - they serve multiple clients at a time, always with a smile. They also take passport pictures.</review>

I go to this location often.  I do field service, and I am always sending back defective networking devices I have replaced.  The staff is fast, polite and efficient.  I don't expect them to supply packing tape for me, becuase if they did that, they would supply it for everyone that walked in the door.  For that reason, I arrive there with my package taped up and labeled, if I have a label. If not, they have no trouble generating a label for me, based on the business I am shipping to.  If their account doesn't come up, or there are issues with the account, I simply recall that this is not UPS's problem, it's the problem of the person or business that wants their stuff back, so I would not even think of yelling at the staff about this...they can, and do, however, answer questions for me.
Great location...the only issus is trying to find  parking in downtown Mountain View...eh...that's the price we pay for convenience.  Keep it up, #120 staff!</review>

The unresponsive staff mistyped the shipping address five times before the shipping label was created. I asked for insurance of value $600 but the staff forgot to do so. Unfortunately, my package was delivered to a unknown address because the staff attached other's label on my package. When I talked to them, the manager is quite rude and yelled at me that this was not their fault and I should take the responsibility for my lost package.< /review>

Worst customer service I've ever experienced, the package I sent didn't even get to its destination, and no refund because somehow they are not responsible for the services they sell. AVOID THIS PLACE<//Text>

<Text>One of my go to spots at least 1-4/month. Hands down some of the friendliest staff members ever. Not only do I enjoy seeing their familiar faces but they recognize mine as well as my daughter's! They always have specialty items and if not they try to get it for you! They have AMAZING deals on meat and produce all the time. Their cheese selection is BIG! In general their store has a wide variety of brands; which I love options! The restrooms are very well kept. The renovation came out awesome! New floors, new sign all of it!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< rate>

If they do not have a certain product they need to let the customer know so that the customer can decide what they really want their nails to look like. They cannot have to do a design and then charge extra for a half done design. I paid $93 for this set and my toenails<//review>

<user_id>115104832750060877098< /user_id><Review>I went there last Saturday November 11, 2017. I end up falling asleep waiting to be served. When I awoke, I asked the lady how much longer would it be for her to replace one nail? She told me in about an hour more.   I thought it was very disrespectful for me as a high tipper to wait basically 2 hours for a nail technician to glue on one single nail. As a matter of fact I think this place deserve two and a half Stars prior to my visit on last Saturday I would have given them four stars three and a half tops< /Review>< gmapID>

Horrible service will never comeback to this nail shop. Lady told me to wash my hands in the same water that my feet were soaking in(gross). I told her no I will not do that! That's unsanitary. Both Ladies were very rude customer service skills need to be improved.< /Text>

<text>They are un professional. The tub was not cleaned out with disinfectant for first off. My middle toe nail split and I ask him to fix it  and he didn't.  So I complain and they only wanted to glue it with the nail polish. They always rushing. Service is horrible. Watch out because they have hidden fees. Taken the gel polish off is a fee and putting it on is a fee.</text>< Pics>

It is a really a cool place. Lots of great things to look at. A historic building , and great murals in the alley. There is always some cool old truck parked outside. They sell new and used motorcycles and scooters. And have a very experienced mechanic that works on them. And now, they have moved in the car shop as well, "Guido Veloce".</Text>

<date>1554487979836<//date><rate>1<//rate><text>Brought my scooter in for a tune-up, exhaust replacement and battery replacement. I provided the exhaust and brand new Prima branded battery, the exhaust was done great, the battery was replaced, but they couldn't get my scooter running.

I transported the scooter to another location, they got it up and running. Through that process I learned that my Prima battery was never installed.  The existing battery was charged instead and the brand new battery was kept by the shop.  That battery cost me $64.99 plus S&H.

Dishonest service by Scooter City.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiqsqBvZVZdL7lZR0g2-TULS57l80lKVn2HJxR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

This place was a joke, I brought my scooter to get my front tire fixed after calling the only guy in the shop by the name of “Mike“  asked me why I brought my whole scooter down and then proceeded to tell me that all his employees are out of town  and he cannot work nor store my scooter in the meantime. Who does that with a professional business mind,  so now not only did I waste my energy walking my scooter from P and 19th but they also lost my money.  Not professional by any means and do NOT recommend to any scooter enthusiast...< /Text>

Lance Cabo 200i
I've been wanting a scooter for several years. I finally made it down to Scooter City last year because they are the only Lance dealers nearby. I've been wanting to check one out in person because a picture obviously isn't the same. I was feeling the dread of walking into a "dealership" expecting rude people with hard sales; however, I was immediately correctly and pleasantly surprised. The individual was incredibly nice and informative. He explained manufacturing backgrounds between the brands and follow up maintenance records. After hearing what I wanted, he gave me a brochure with some other websites. He suggested I look into a few other comparable options before making a final decision. No hard sales. I continued on with my life and went through the process of getting a motorcycle license. I came back 6-7 months later and experienced the exact same informative kindness. I bought a Lance that was already in the shop and took it home that evening. Very nice people that aren't pushy. They're knowledgeable willing to share that knowledge. Its obvious this is their passion. Great experience overall.< /review>

<Review>Didn't get much help,just bought a new scooter...my muffler came loose ,and I figured since I saw their as in the paper ,they would maintenance it, it did have a picture of the same scooter in their sale ads,so after waiting a few minutes for the gent to finish with a phone call, I gave him the rundown,and without a blink he said he can't help me,that they don't work on those types of scooter. I thought he at least should've gave effort. Maybe he really wanted to help the cute lady that rode up on a motorcycle right after me...which I did offer him to help her first,since I'm a gentleman. But he insisted... On getting my out there as quick as possible..</Review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

Bad parking situation. Don't count on business parking because spots are taken up by junked cars from the main car shop that resides there. Rude customer service. Lacks basic full size motorcycle tire balancing, tube replacement. The experience was from about a year and a half ago? Review re-written after noticing my feedback was either flagged or something else. Maybe things have gotten better.<//text>

<review>I walked into this place today with my wife. We were two of three total customers in this place. There was one staff member. He barely aknowledged us and went back to his one customer. We waited 20+ minutes before my wife just got tired of waiting so we said good bye and left. You would at the very least think the staff member would have said "I'm sorry, is there anything I can help you with"? Or "can I point you in the right direction"?. Nope! He just waved back us with a smile, laughed and went back to his customer. Talk about not having a clue on how to multitask. My wife and I will never return to this horrible place and we, today, purchased three brand new scooters from ATV Wholesale off Auburn road. The staff there was way more busy and greated us when we walked in.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>My scooter back tire died catastrophically last week. Luckily I was four blocks away from Scooter City and managed to get my Vespa over there. They had a tire in stock and even though they were busy managed to get it scheduled. Picked it up the next day and they had checked some other things - IDK what, but the bike seemed 'tighter'.
Nice guys in there. I miss the old guy 'Mike' from the old Alfa Romeo location, but I'm glad it's closer to my commute.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Veterans Park Monument is a beautiful remembrance of our local fallen Heroes. Marble benches to rest on.  Walking under tall old trees. In the center of it all is the tall white majestic Merced County Courthouse now a Public Museum. Get your steps in!!!<//text>

Excellent place to play pokemon go. On the down side, there are usually homeless people around and not-so-great lighting.<//review>

<text>Quiet place to sit in the shade and watch the world go by in peace. Get fresh hot dogs from the hot dog vendor on the corner and enjoy your lunch on one of the benches. You can walk around the garden and read the memorial walls for all of the soldiers from Merced. Or go up to the courthouse museum and look at all of the things from yesteryear on display.<//text><UserId.>102897940882866873407< /UserId.>< response>

<review>Nice place to see nature in the middle of the city. Green grass, big trees creating shade, benches for sitting & fluffy tailed squirrels looking for or eating food, playing & chasing each other. I enjoyed relaxing, watching & taking pictures of the squirrels. I saw a hotdog stand, but I didn't get anything or look at the menu. The only bad thing that I noticed was there were homeless people, some sleeping & some with big piles of "stuff" or "belongings" that would make some people feel uncomfortable & they didn't make great backgrounds for my squirrel pics.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I'd like but around the Court House it's to many homeless and they leave to much trash, and I feel so sadness because the monuments at the park are not clean, I think on my opinion that place must be clean so people came from others city's or country's can take a good looking pictures, thanks sincerely Gerardo Diaz ❤️🙏🙏🙏</review>

<review>Unlike other parks there are no falling limbs from dead trees,  dead grass with stickers, or wet mud areas from broken water lines. Small but green and near the library.</review>< gmap_id>

Its not a park. It's a garden in front of the courthouse with lots of sad, poorly cared for trees, unhappy for poor planting and lack of climate considerations. Theres also a half dead rose garden if you're into that.<//Text>

It used to be overran by the homeless population and drug addicts until it became A hot-spot location for Pokemon Go. Now you see more and more families and students ranging from middle school thru college aimlessly walking while starring at their phones</Review>

<Review>We are a bit picky with certain foods. I'm pregnant so I'm having weird feelings about seafood and chicken lol. This place blew us away. Husband is Navy and has had this kind of stuff overseas and he was absolutely delighted with the flavors here! I got some orange beef and oh boy was I happy. Husband got beef and veggies and ate almost the entire plate they brought. Will be back for sure and will bring the older kids!

Super friendly, fast service, attentive and clean place. 🥇⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐< /Review>< response>

Boy, am I glad we did. Not only was the staff friendly, the food came really quick and everything was hot and fresh. We got the Mongolian Beef, always a favorite, and we tried the House Special Beef. You guys... you guys, seriously, I think the House Special Beef was the best dish I've ever eaten. I'm having an emotional response to it right now. We got these dishes with fried rice, and we started with cream cheese wontons and some wonton soup. Every. Thing. Was. Delicious. Do yourself a favor; get your butt in there, give them all your money, and get ready to have the best Chinese food going!< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyJNXNMHZ_b6UXipiToybV8Arh-cJxg-8lBxIw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkdv_UapdCGR1DeJvcWo9x6RyWLALaySvVI4oT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOkjN2q2eXO1Z_moEmFmqPB8XI3coaMbFvdETF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-MkmX_3F6h6LQK50cm5xTvcAHOniEi75jbO8X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMG0XY59wTnmY1STqR_av8mRnOvcSPTXoUtRMp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Been looking for a decent mandarin spot for awhile in this area. Ding ding ding we have a winner! The portions are amazing, food is on point and price is decent. Did I mention the customer service was up to par especially during these hard times for businesses. Please support them by stoping by, you won’t be disappointed.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYFyq-trFJAvYgmUMjE1frmks6lvMxBOK8plJh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

We visited less than two weeks after its opening and had a surprisingly good meal. The food was flavorful and delicious and the service exceptionally friendly and helpful without being obtrusive.

We had generous portions of their wonton soup and shrimp soft noodles, which we really enjoyed. They make their own crispy wontons, about the best I've encountered.

We're not often in the area but will definitely return the next time we're in the area seeking Chinese food.</text>

< Review>
Such good food! The sweet and sour sauce that comes to the table with the crispy chips is delicious. I highly recommend their signature wings- the best wings I have ever had. The Mongolian beef was also great. The portions are large- you will not leave hungry. The staff was tentative and friendly.< /Review>

The sweet and sour chicken was inedible and I had to throw away, it was Refried, and very hard to bite into. The chop suey didn’t have flavor and the egg rolls were not good at all. Overly greasy with no flavor was my experience.</text>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I’ve been going to another Chinese food restaurant down here in the South Bay for the past few years and decided to give a new place a shot (new to me). My regular place was good but THIS PLACE.....THE BEST, hands down! The establishment was very clean. The lady who took my order over phone was friendly. The food was only 5 mins over her quote time, but I’m okay with that because that meant my food was FRESH! Getting home the food was piping hot. The food was fantastic and of good quality. The salt n pepper chicken wings are the best I’ve had in the South Bay Area. Mongolian beef was nice and savory and the lo mein was just as tasty. This will now be my family’s new Chinese food spot!< /review>< Pics>

The food is amazing. Everything is very tasty and far better than any other spot I have been to. On top of that the staff are very friendly and attentive. Could not recommend this place enough!</Review>

I would’ve added pictures of the food but it was too good to stop eating🤤😋
The Salt n Pepper wings were delicious! And the rest of the food was amazing and tasteful. This will be my new go to for Chinese. Especially because of the AMAZING customer service.</review>

New establishment but great old chinese style flavor. Gracious servings whether you dine in or out. Fresh ingredients,  clean environment and large selection of food to choose from. I highly recommend this place to my own family and friends. Courteous employees to finalize a fine dining experience.< /Review>

So I had the Salt and pepper white meat and the fried rice and ufffffwas I blown away... the rice is usually basic everywhere you go but not here. Very good quality and tastes delightful. Will be coming back here as my go to for chinese and the staff is nice and friendly too so dont think have to twice about having lunch here. youll enjoy it and it calm quiet environment</review>

(Translated by Google) Kyoto ribs, fish with black pepper and pepper, the amount of lunch set meal is so large that one cannot finish it. The taste is very good. The running hall is handsome and beautiful, and the service attitude is also very good. The store is clean and tidy, and the dining experience is very comfortable.

2020/12
During the epidemic, only take-out was available. Walnut shrimp, Gongbao, and fish-flavored eggplant were all good. Less sugar next time you order.

(Original)
京都排骨，豉椒鱼，午饭套餐的量已经很大了一个人吃不完。味道很不错。跑堂是帅哥美女，服务态度也非常好。店面干净整洁，很舒服的进餐体验。

2020/12
疫情期间只有外卖，核桃虾、宫宝三样、鱼香茄子都不错。下次点的时候要少糖。< /review>

<Text>I usually dont review places but I thought id speak my mind. I Came here from seeing all the advertisments  and good reviews so i thought id give it a try. Bad decision. The pizzas are overpriced and VERY STALE. I was really dissapointed. Im sorry but Im not sure why this place has so many good reviews You are better off buying 4 little cesears pizzas and it still wouldnt equal 2 medium pizzas here! Also the waiting time is ridiculous 🙄🤔 I would give it a negative stars if possible.< /Text>< rate>

You know, all things considered, simply go in to purchase equipment/instruments from this location. Great staff, but the online ordering has some kinks for sure. Still though, great store.</Review>

< Review>
Small. 50 guitars. Just enough employees to still be slow, unresponsive, even with eye contact. I always find that weird. I get it.... sometimes I forget I'm at work to. At least ask me why I'm staring at you. And the only reason I'm not saying it...... cause I need you brother. Can't start it off on the wrong foot as a customer. I may have never been told that the floor model amp I wanted to get was literally stacked like a pony wall behind me.
*ok... so I'm not always the shiniest penny in the cup holder myself*
Overall very helpful and I was in and out with what I came for. And I didn't have to enjoy my mask breath for to long. Thanks for hanging in there GC.<//Review>

Do not, under any circumstance do business with this store.  Their confidence in the products they sell ends when you exit the store. They will not stand behind any product they sell including strings.  And the manager Sean is neither customer friendly or concerned about retaining long time customers.  No wonder the company stock is plummeting.  Stay away from this store.

Update:  I have done as you asked.  Let's see what happens.

Update:  Did exactly as was requested of me.  Three days later, nothing...

Update:  It is now 4/26 and the management of this store has done nothing to rectify a defective product.  No contact, no follow up, no concern about a customer.  The polite and seemingly concerned comment in response to this review from corporate is worthless and simply a PR smokescreen.  I will be adding to this review as time goes on.

Update: 5/4/21.  Still nothing.<//text>

It's a great place to come and experience different instruments types of music genres excetera. What do you want to try out one of the new guitars check out The Sound Room get on the drums check out the keyboards. It's also great place to get all your equipment restringing for entire guitars drop it off they have it done pretty quickly. They did an excellent job on my last one. That was fierce pretty cool laid-back seems a little bit cliquish think they could be a little more friendly to people that might not be in the same Realm.<//review>

It's not a bad place. Just go expecting to get an adequate customer experience. They don't always know everything, most are new, so if you need an expert you'll probably want to ask the guitar tech or your friend who tinkers. I'm usually that guy so I try to boost their confidence at the store, give them hints when they're lost, or give them some positive feedback if they don't have an answer.< /text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Kind of crazy that a Guitar Center in the desert is better stocked than a Guitar Center in the central valley.  I am not sure how bad the chapter 11 bankruptcy mixed with less people going out is hurting stock or if someone at corporate is just holding back, but this store did not have much available.  Might be better to order off the website or Musicians Friend (also owned by Guitar Center) if you have something particular in mind or order it from the store.  I will say that they did have a fairly healthy stock of acoustic guitars, so they got that going for them.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80905133d3b79cc9:0x486ecfd1124c34c1<//gmap_id></record>

The first time I went to this store the person that helped me was amazing, I even bought a guitar. Second time I came to this store I was very disappointed that I couldn’t buy a piano because I couldn’t get anybody to help me< /Text>

Walked in to buy a bass head and was told my home made mask wasn't good enough. My mask is thicker then there paper blue mask that his dirty hands were touching. So me and my 10 year old daughter left and won't be back</text>

I love my ukulele. The staff was super helpful :) I fell in love with the employee that has a man bun. He was hot, when I say hot! I mean HOT. The guy was wearing a mask & he was still fine af. 10/10 recommend going to Guitar Center to let that man step on you< /Text>

Product that was sold to me did not work, I wanted to exchange it, but they had none, so I requested a refund, I had receipt.
The kid started giving me attitude for not wanting to wait for the shipment to come in.
I told him I live near Yosemite and it too far to travel back here, he started giving me more attitude saying they could mail it, but mail is not the best up there and I just want a refund, so I can get it at another store, some other customer or off duty employee started putting his two cents in and the sale clerk started to chuckle and said something under his breath and proceeded to give me my money.
What a hassle.</Review>

<Review>NEVER AGAIN......I recently purchased a new Gibson Les Paul Studio Guitar from Musician's Friend, which is owned by Guitar Center. The guitar shipped out of Guitar Center in Modesto, CA. The guitar I received looks like a used Demo. model, and it is missing all of the usual Gibson accessories that come with a new guitar. The soft guitar case is also damaged. Everything shipped in a plain cardboard box, and not a Gibson factory box. For a $1,500+ purchase, I would expect a lot better service than this. Buyer beware, this place will rip you off!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>More guitars than I could play in a day. I didn't even peek into the pro audio or acoustic guitar rooms. They have soundproof practice rooms for private lessons. I really appreciate their 45day exchange policy. When I realized the instrument  I purchased didn't match my playing style, they invited me to hang around & try out as many as I felt like to take home what I really wanted.<//text><Date>1552018065994<//Date>< GmapID>

Very helpful and knowledgeable. They were extremely kind and respectful with my 70 year old schizophrenic brother who loves guitars and music. He was nervous and talkative but wanted desperately to get guitar with “special” strings. They knew exactly what he was talking about and saved my day.< /Review>

Im pretty sure it would be a lot better if covid-19 wasn't happening. That at being said they had some nice guitars but some of the guitars were missing a Floyd rose that were hanging on the wall or missing the bottom e string part thats apart of the floyd rose. Some guitars had loose volume nobs. Just wasn't really presentable if you ask me.</Review>

When we visited, the normally excellent customer service took a while, but one particular clerk was very helpful once we found her. The store was very busy and the clerk's very busy talking to each other across the store about non-work related things (lunch, parties, etc). Honestly a little disappointed this visit...not up to the usual standards. I only rated it 4 stars because of the one very helpful and attentive clerk.</Text>

Bought my granddaughter her first Pearl drum set. I put it together but never tuned a drum.  I took it into the Guitar Center where they have a huge drum section.Even though they don't have a service department Weston tuned it and set her up for a free intro class. Thanks for a great start!<//review>

Walls covered in guitars and great prices abound.  If you like music and musicians this will be your Nirvana.  Someone is always trying out a guitar when ever I visit.  Friendly helpful staff, great prices, great selection, I had to give this place 5 stars.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I received excellent service from Shane and he was assisted by I believe Aton. These guys helped me get everything that I needed for my home studio and made suggestions where I was unfamiliar and allowed me to make the choice without feeling pressured. I asked so many questions I felt embarrassed, but Shane even took the time to draw a diagram of how to hook up everything!! Talk about exceptional service, well this was beyond that. If I become a one hit wonder, they're set for life too. Thanks guys

I just needed a guitar patch chord and I stood at the checkout for the better part of a half hour to pay for my guitar chord and I was first in line. There was two guys behind the counter. I was wishing they had self checkout so I could pay and go. I felt uncomfortable and invisible here.< /review>< rating>

I went in needing a snare drum for a student. Don't know anything about them but the associate was very knowledgeable and helpful. He effortlessly answered by questions on the performance of the product, the replacement coverage plan, and alternative options. I had a great experience and if the need arises it will be the first place I go.</review>

Huge selection, usually a customer service rep in every department. Lessons, repair, books, and knowledgeable staff that will allow you to strum, fiddle and bang on drums to your hearts content without buying. The only big box place left in town to buy musical equipment.<//review>

My son has had his bass fixed here. My most recent visit was to get his acoustic bridge reglued, it was a better value to buy him a step up new guitar instead. So that's what we did after my son played them and chose his new model.</Review>< pics>

<text>The staff was nice, but not incredibly interested in trying to help. I wanted to try out a pedal but the amp they had to practice on was busted.

The store has changed over the years. They now offer lessons and have added private lesson rooms. The staff is friendly and usually well informed of their dept. looking into getting piano lessons for my 9yo next month. Will update how that goes.<//Review>

<Text>Sunday afternoon and quiet. Bought a cajon full price that had scratches from being on the showroom floor. I see customers abuse equipment, particularly kids and always think, if I had stock in the company I wouldn't like seeing product trashed and sold for new in this condition. All in all a good experience.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

One of the worst sales persons I've seen in awhile. They just sit around like their waiting on a pizza to show up.
The guy at the drum Department had absolutely no knowledge on anything the girl in the guitar section was the same way seems like they get these people off the street and throw a freaking name tag on them will not do business at that store<//Review>

Went in for a last minute pack of strings left a loyal customer. Marc was very knowledgeable and friendly. Unheard of customer service. They will definitely go the extra mile to make sure you get exactly what you need. Overwhelmingly positive experience especially when compared with surrounding music shops. I used to order online exclusively but I think I might be visiting Guitar Center more often. 5/5<//review>

I found the guitar I really wanted but it didn't sound quite right, so I looked at a set of fender upgrade pickups. The tech Josh said he could install them for me right away. I didn't even have to ask! That's great customer service! I am 100% happy. No buyers remorse LOL.
Thank you Josh!!<//Review>

Nice selection of gear.  Only a few people know anything useful here.  Be sure you find the right person or prepare to be disappointed.   If you are lucky some famous  musician might be in shopping when you visit.  Picked up a world class kazoo along with sheet music.  Really wanted to learn how to play theme to the Godfather on the kazoo.  They didn't offer lessons for the kazoo, but they do for other instruments.  I really want to learn how to beat box but they didn't sell them buy they might now so be sure to ask them.  Would be nice to wiki wiki beep beep wick wick wick wiiki wick.< /Review>

Every musician has a story of a big chain music store that is over-priced and full of rude employees who think THEY are rock stars. (TY Barry Crimins)
But this place is different. You can try Craigslist and drive all over the Central Valley to save $40....but it's not worth the headache. Especially when the seller tells you how well the guitar plays, so you drive 30 miles to find out is a POS.
I've purchased two guitars at GC and am going back this week for another. I love this place. It has a good vibe and fair prices...</review>

I was surprised by the disarray of the drum room. The floor was littered with tags and had not been vacuumed in some time. The Roland demo set that I came to see was broken and missing knobs. No service. No one was working in the drum area and music lessons seem the priority as employees passed me by. This was on a Saturday with a few customers.</text>

They guy had to go ask his manger and he said we do not take items back that are software. WILL NOT BE RETURING TO THIS STORE EVER AGAIN. If I need anything in the digital world I will take my business else where. Thank goodness we have the internet!!

P.S. STOP SELLING SOFTWARE!!
IF YOU CANT RETURN IT!!

Goodbye Guitar Center!!<//Text>< Pics>

This place should hire more people! I waited 20mins to get helped. People complained about it as well. You'd think they at least acknowledge you and say "be right with you" these people didn't say a thing! After I finally got helped, she didn't know much about the product! Seemed like I knew more! Definitely walked out with nothing and I'm taking my business else where.</review>

This is not a place for Real Musicians. I swear the customer service has dropped down so much. People ignore you unless you are trying to test out a guitar or amp and they turn down the volume on you while there are kids banging on the acoustic drum set. Very rude employees telling you to move out of their way instead of saying excuse me. No wonder there are talks of Guitar Center going out of business. I hope they do. Try Reverb or Sweetwater if you are looking for an instrument.<//Review>

They as a company promulgate some kind of elitist attitude amongst employees that is extremely irritating from a customer's POV. Over the years as they effectively replaced Sam Ash for most, I aa well have used them for all of my instrument needs and continue to be one of their customers but feel I must say this: their employees at all locations have a tendency for rudeness. No matter how you phrase your question (whatever it is) they will find a way to make you fewl stupid! Highly recommend.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>The guy that helped me with an acoustic and an electric setup was friendly. Both guitars are in much better shape.

My fender hellcat acoustic had action that was way too high. It's much easier to play after he lowered the bridge, strung up some new strings and adjusted the truss rod. Sustain is improved on higher frets as well since it's way easier to push down the strings. Super happy with this setup.

My Ibanez gio seemed impossible to intonate the g string when I left it and the action was set high to compensate for the last 4 frets not ringing out at all. He straightened out the truss rod, replaced the strings and lowered the action. Sustain is improved across the whole fretboard and the intonation seems to be fixed. There's still slight buzzing when I play hard, but it's a cheap electric and I wasn't expecting there not to be. Probably needs a little fretwork. For $50 bucks the other fixes made it worthwhile.

I'm happy with both setups. Best $110 I ever spent.< /text>< Rating>

We had very helpful associates talk to us about a variety of guitars, giving us a better understanding of what is best for our needs.  Also, it is a fun place to try out the instruments and hear very good musicians show off the potential of the instruments.< /text>

Great place! Every GC is worth a stop if you are interested in musical equipment. This was my first time in Modesto's. It's not as big as other GCs but man is it packed! I was there checking out some bass guitars. The great thing about GC is the variety, new or used, and you can try them all out, they don't bother you unless it looks like you need help or you ask. I was just killing some time but I spotted a nice 5 string I might be back for.</review>

Everyone I talked to was always prompt and helpful with my request. The pickup was quick and efficient. Don't know who "Joe" worked with, but my experience was all good.

And honestly, who complains about someone hanging up when a phone connection is bad? Really dude? They obviously weren't "too busy" to try and help you, but if I can't hear what someone is saying on the phone, I'm gonna tell em, hang up, and wait for a call back.

Take your business elsewhere...you'll save all the good working people the hassle of having to deal with you.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80905133d3b79cc9:0x486ecfd1124c34c1<//gmap_id></record>

Very chill place with awesome workers  and they helped me and my older brother find electric guitar strings that had little to no nickel, due to my allergy i can't use any with it or alot which anyone that play's any guitar knows how much of an inconvenience it is since most strings have nickel.<//text>

Employees are so busy it's hard to get assistance. I told the guy working in their today, if you don't want to help me, you don't have to. He was being kinda rude towards me and their prices are marked wrong two different prices for the same item.<//text>

Store is great. Some of the guys are great. The only thing is, theres a particular group of workers that bad mouth customers. Wekt in the other day to get an acoustic on sale the other say. Dude straight up told me this isn't a good guitar, but if this is all you can afford.. Then basically kept telling me hpw crappy it is amd that I'd better get a warranty.  Not too sure if that's proper salesmanship or hpw theu hook people in. But I'm a regular customer at almost all guitar centers in the valley. This one how ever has great people. But that one bald guy with a beard akd deep voice tries to run the place but is totally rude to customers he don't like. Then his group will remeber the face and they all give non quality help and insight towards something that I wanna buy. He gives me a hard time every single trip to their location. And I kinda don't wanna drive a few hours out to another GC to avoid him</Text>
