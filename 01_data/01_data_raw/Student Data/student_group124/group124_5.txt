Truly a 'Safari' of Talavera planters and Animals!

I have never seen the this size variety of Talavera anywhere else. We bought two large planters and a few animal figures. Very high quality products and reasonable prices! Well be back soon for sure!<//text>

My wife n I visited about a yr ago and the staff was nice, patient, and attentive. The time we went they were a bit busy, but they were taking care of many. I used the time to purchase more plants! 300.00 dollars later I was happy decorating my patio n my wife indoors.  In fact, we are going there tomorrow 5.26.2020 to look for more plants! Plant lovers must go!< /review>

I always love to go to Plant Safari. My husband says that every time we go there , I bankrupt him . Every corner I look I see something I love. Was there last week came home with 2 large pots , got good prices for them. And a middle size one (pot). The girls know their business.< /review>

<Review>I found this place by chance when going to another business near there. This place is AMAZING and I am so glad I found it! I've had such a hard time finding stores that sell nice indoor plants that aren't extremely expensive. They have so, so, SO many beautiful plants and their prices are great. You can really tell they take care of the plants there and that there is passion behind the business and not just people trying to make a quick buck. I will definitely be back to buy some more plants!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>I went to this spot today and I was amazed!!!   The owner is a wonderful lady who knows her stuff about plants and pottery.  I found exactly what I’ve been looking for at a fraction of the price the online retailers and the local stores are asking for.  I was given several decorative ideas that I plan on carrying out with their help.  Everyone is so helpful and polite.  I recommend checking out this spot before going anywhere else!!!!!</text></record>

I'm a very shy person so I appreciated that while there was definitely help available if I chose to ask for it, that I was mostly left alone to look around as I pleased. That's definitely a huge plus for me. Also, this place is massive. Gorgeous selection of indoor plants, gorgeous flowering plants outside, and I loved the succulents. Would prefer a better cacti selection but no one's perfect. Appreciated the unique and unusual plants as well as the more common specimens. I will absolutely be returning for those split leaf monsteras.< /text>

Wow, what a nursery! Plant Safari has a sizeable selection of plants, but their indoor section is impressive. Wall to wall green in a beautiful old house! Many of the staff are not only helpful, but knowledgeable and able to offer advice on helping your plants thrive. Prices are very reasonable as well, especially when you consider how much healthier the plants here are then at a big store like Home Depot or Lowes.</text>

Im hooked! since my first time here, the seasonal variety always has me looking forward to my next visit. I have been to most of the plant nurseries in the area but this location is, by far, is my favorite. The younger girls are always very courteous and informative when i have questions and dont judge me when i tell them my gardening misfortunes lol. I love the check out process the inside of the place is a plant lovers dream.</Review>

<Review>I am a longtime customer and do enjoy their products. I have spent thousands of dollars on this website between tincture, flowers, and edibles. All other places from which I order regularly include a free gift. This is smart because it lets me learn about new products to order as well as a fun way to encourage me to order again. Kushcab regularly skips sending a gift even though each order is close to 200 dollars, sometimes more. I probably only receive gifts on 1/3 of my orders. I am very displeased and have expressed my dissatisfaction to them in the past. I was told to place another order and they would make up for it in that order. I immediately placed another 200 dollar order and received one small gift instead of the two that should now be included to make up for the mistake and new order. The next order I again received no gift and again was told to place another order. Again, I immediately ordered and received only one small gift. Now, they send no gifts and don't respond to my emails. I plan to take my business elsewhere and implore that you consider this review before placing an order here. My business is treated with respect elsewhere.

Update: Kushcab delivery deleted this review within one hour of me posting it onto their website.</Review>< pictures>

We use to get a nice driver that delivered the same day. This time it went through FedEx and it is still not here 2 days later and they already took my 250.00. Now I'm on hold with FedEx. This is a nightmare.<//Review>

This is the first time I’ve ordered from KushCab Delivery, and I will definitely be ordering from them again!

The ordering and payment process was very simple and quick, and the delivery was fast as well!

The product I ordered/received was excellent, as was the free gift I got with my order! Thanks for that!

I highly recommended KushCab Delivery if you’re in California!<//Review>

<Review>They really deliver on their products and service!  I’m a first time customer ordering for next day delivery and had an issue with the delivery.  Explained the situation to LAKushCab and they sent out a replacement order the very next day. They have great customer service and truly stand by their word. Highly recommend this business.< /Review>< pictures>

Their response times are unbeatable. I was surprised how reactive they were. I've recommended it to 2 friends and I'll recommend to many more!< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I live in a rural area so getting pods is difficult. Not with KC. I placed my order and was immediately responded to through text by an actual person. I was able to ask a few questions about the process through text and was responded to immediately. Confirming my license was very easy. Couldn’t be happier.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Update- I started using this company for Vape pods/carts ordering. I’ve been using the services for several months. Probably on order no.5/6. Me and my co worker has been in on it. Gaining reward points for small discounts later. Great, easy, and fast services.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Before I rate the individual strains that I tried, I’d like to rate the service itself. While I live in Northern California, I’m still new to the on-line ordering and not using my local dispensary. That being said; to set up your account, be verified, and signed up for news, and getting my FTC 10% off code,  the process was super user-friendly and set up and ready to shop within minutes. I don’t like “razzle/dazzle “ on my sites-just info! KushCab was sooo easy to navigate and to order. I like the way the payment is done. Great idea! Their menu was full of top shelf, Verified Products and I felt safe to shop. The pricing is super fair and you get a goody with your order. And they offer a super deal called “KushCredits” and the more you order, the more you earn back. I’ve placed several orders and I’ve not had a problem with one. In fact, the products I purchased did not disappoint!!
I’ve definitely found my home delivery service!</Review>

Super nice - super good prices. I recently had surgery and didn't want to depend on the opioids prescribed to me so I decided to get some edibles delivered. The prices were super affordable, the site is super easy to navigate through and the delivery process itself left nothing to be desired. The text message updates were from a real person that was friendly and when I came out on my crutches the guy told me that next time he would meet me at my door so I wouldn't have to go too far. Super comforting experience. Definitely recommend.<//Review>

I’ve surely never come across any marijuana delivery team that compares with kushcab.  They have an amazing selection of goods, fast delivery, friendly drivers. I would rate them higher if I could.

I was initially very skeptical about using this service but my products were delivered this morning. It was super easy and incredibly convenient if you don’t have time to actually go or simply aren’t familiar where to get certain products in your area.

The packaging was discreet... they even threw in a free krispy treat! No complaints whatsoever. Will definitely be using their services again and referring them to my friends.  Thanks KC!<//Review>

Vape cartridges and pens from them as well as flowers and pre rolls. Only once did I have a problem with a car trade and they promptly replaced it with a brand new one! The include all kinds of little surprises in their packages for their long-term customers. I cannot say enough about how great this company is I will be a customer with them forever!< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2cb97cd6c931d:0xcd3ad7e7039bfe3f<//GmapID><Time>1554649862312<//Time>< user_id>

<Review>I loved Kush Cab. I did!
They are always on point with free /extra gifts and trying to have good quick communication BUT as someone who had been getting deliveries from them for almost a year I have noticed customer service slide off as prices have steadily increased.
Adding almost 10$ in tax (which I get is a California thing) THEN charging 15$ For shipping (when it used to be 10$ which is already outrageous for students who are already just trying to get by)
Coupled with customer service reps who clearly don’t know what paypal or google wallet service to use and what money is being sent where.
And the fact the last 3 times I’ve ordered edibles from there they have been stale and inedible has made Kush Cab an inviable option anymore. We don’t order there anymore :/
Which sucks because this WAS one of the cheapest and best options for us just starting out.<//Review>< user_name>

Very friendly people. They were quick to answer any questions I had. Delivered in a timely matter. I got the brownie bites and it came with two. I thought it was 85mg with both brownies but each brownie is 85mg thc, so that was a pleasant surprise. They even added a gummy for me. Wasn't expecting that but I thought it was so nice! Definitely reccomend them!!<//Text>

I have been a customer with KCD for the past 2 years and counting. Hands down one of; if not the best delivery service in Cali. Products are top shelf. Edibles and Vape pens are of the best quality. The service is uncanny. Timely  delivery and excellent customer appreciation. I order consistently from Kush Cab and I’m never disappointed. KEEP UPBTHE GREAT WORK!💯👍🏽< /review>

<Review>Ordered on a Saturday and expected to receive on Wednesday. This review is to the customer service which is top notch. A preroll I wanted was no longer available so they gave me a different preroll, which was $5 more, but the extra cost was free of charge to me.

They didn’t have to do that and easily could’ve given me a same price preroll, but that’s just good customer service. Also, I live in north cal but they deliver from LA area through mail. Awesome. Hope they keep refining their menu (even though it’s sweet right now) with more variety when it comes to prerolls and concentrates.</Review><username>Johnson N</username>< Time>

So I thought I'd give KC a try.. why not. . sounds nice and easy.. no muss no fuss getting UPS to deliver it I don't have to deal with anyone on a personal level. .again, sounds nice and easy. .. I checked out their website and found a very nice selection of most of the major categories... I like cartridges and flowers so I'm happy with what I've got to pick from.. definitely more to choose from than most on-line ordering website's... Now the pricing per unit is a tad bit higher too but I've no problem paying a few more dollars for their commitment to take up extra space for a larger inventory...Nice job KC Crew and Eugene..
So I went ahead with my first order of a couple of different oil cartridges (Grape Ape and Platinum OG).. in the full 1000mg cannisters.. they must have been out of the full cannisters so sent me 2 500mg of each instead.. NICE JOB EVERYONE!! No big issues ..they just took care of it.. too my satisfaction no less.. now the best part of this review is the condition of the package when it arrived...on time but not necessarily in good condition. . The package looked like UPS had been running over it and then dragging it behind their truck. .. so needless to say my hopes of anything surviving such utter destruction and violence unleashed upon my poor little HAPPY PACKAGE were looking grim. .. BUT OH NO! !! The best HAPPY PACKAGE PACKERS in the business packed my little package and not a scratch or bump or bruise to be found on anything that was safe insides the package.. .Way To Go All of You.. And You Know who You Are Dont Ya?? Great Job. .and now we don't have to start the pain in the butt process of trying to get it made good... 👍👍🏼👍🏾.. so in the end I will definitely be a customer in the future and thanks to the KC Crew and Eugene. .thanks for the Brownie Bite too Guys. . nice little surprise

Update : 10 plus months of using their services and I'm still using them so that should answer the question of Do I still like them? Yes I Do ...<//text>

<Response>None</Response><Name>Jon Lo</Name><Review>Awesome escape room! Our groups have done about 10 escape rooms and this by far is our top 3. We had no idea what we were getting ourselves into as this is one of three scary escape rooms in San Diego. This was a referral from one of my friends and we just say why the heck not. As we got there we we're briefed and set up into our rooms. Get there early because there are waivers and questions that you might want to ask when you get there. Be sure to ask questions. This escape room is not like the others. They have very good clues and the props were cool. It definitely fits the theme and an extra surprise will be awaiting for you in your rooms. Like the other escape rooms we get three clues. Our host Chris was very entertaining and helpful with the clues. Our group got out with 20:31 to spare. Super fun and highly recommend. Happy hauntings!</Review>< user>

Loved the experience. So much fun! Some of the clues are easy to find, but others were more difficult. Love these type of group events.< /text>

Pretty good. Really like the way they themed it. However some of the puzzles are kinda broken even with a full understanding of how to get the solution.  However we had fun which is the entire point.</Text>

The escape room was eh. It was in some sketch motel/ office building and was run down, poorly maintained, and poorly designed. Staff was really friendly. Not going to that one ever again. There are much much better for about the same price.<//text>

< review>
What a fun night! *Spoiler free review*
My group of 4 booked the 9:30 Harvest Motel room and we were very anxious to begin. Our Game Master Chris welcomed us and made sure we knew all of the rules and the backstory of the room. He then split us into our 4 separate rooms and the game began. The puzzles themselves were not too difficult, they were all things that we had seen before. Even though the puzzles were fairly easy, what kept us on our toes was the and fear of the unknown evil in the room.
Some puzzles do require outside knowledge but you have 3 hints if you need to use one for it. We personally didn't find it an issue because at least one person in our group knew the answer.
The atmosphere kept the room feeling spooky and kept us on edge the whole time. The ending puzzle was a little anti-climactic but with that evil force in there, we just happy to escape it! We got out with 16 minutes left  and felt accomplished. Looking back at it the room wasn't too difficult with was mostly just the part of being separated that made our adrenaline kick in. I would recommend this to groups of 4-8; I think 12 (which is there max booking) would just be too big especially if you book for a group of 4 and then get paired with randoms for the rest.

Overall, the game was fun, thrilling, and a great way to bond.
This was my 46th room, I would recommend this room mostly to beginners but also to enthusiasts who are looking for a spooky separation room game.

Shout out to the Game Master Chris for being awesome and talking with us after the game too, we really appreciated it!<//review>

< Review>
This was our first time in an Escape Room and it was AWESOME. We did the Harvest Motel. At first we were scared to go in but as they said we came out of there laughing and with a load of great memories. The rooms are all different, interesting and confusing. Communication is the key:)
It was super fun and I wish I could forget everything and go again and again.
We will for sure return to do the other rooms!< /Review>

<Name>Philthy An< /Name><text>Super fun escape room...roughly $18 pp after Groupon.  We did the hourglass room and it was perfect for our group of 8.  Some of the decorations were worn out and the props to open the door weren't functioning properly so I'll deduct 1.25 stars (I'll give 3.75 stars) from that considering how spendy it was. We were a group of mostly beginners and were able to solve the puzzle with out using any hints which was our goal.  Staff were friendly however the area leaves a lot to be desired.  The restroom although clean and stocked felt very uncomfortable and worn out as well.<//text>< gmap_id>

We bought a Groupon for the Hourglass room and arrived about 15 min before game time. Justin was a great game host - very enthusiastic and friendly!
Pros about the game/experience:
*good game for beginners & advanced
*had a nice mix of beginning finds to get the game moving right off
*utilized several media sources (audio, visual, etc) as part of the game
*unique puzzles and challenges
*open weeknights!

Cons about the game:
*parking situation (not directly related to the game though!) was limited. We came in one car, so not too big of an issue but if I had a larger group I am not sure there were enough designated spots for everyone.
*the clues to solve the puzzle in the room weren't intuitive. Meaning we found a clue and it had information, but it wasn't innately clear if the info itself was the clue, or if the info + the object = a puzzle to solve to get the clue. Sorry if that's ambiguous, I'm trying to be vague so I don't give away anything about the game.

We are more of "vets" to the escape game world (though we brought 2 friends who were newbies) and all 4 of us had a great time! The hotel room sounds awesome if you like scary stuff - maybe the hubby will be back for that one! In the meantime, I'm looking forward to if/when they release new rooms (that aren't scary ;) )

Oh! And on the way out Justin offered to let us play the "travel escape game" and it was so cool! That's the first time I've seen a mini-version of an escape room that can all be done on the table top. Great job, 3rd Day Escape! Thank you for a fun night out!<//Text>

My young teen wanted to do this with some friends. They didn't finish, but had a lot of fun. There was a misunderstanding, and planned out their time based on instructions as they understood them. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars...the instructions weren't clear to them. But if the point was for them to enjoy themselves - they surely did that!</Review>

<text>The motel escape room was awesome! We had Joe as our host and we was great! He greeted us in the parking lot when we arrived and was awesome. We went on a Saturday night for my dads birthday. This is honestly fun for the whole family (except little kids). We had a blast and couldnt stop talking about it the whole way home. The clues were just right. They weren't too easy which it made it all the better! Everyone had to contribute and work together. The sets were awesome as well and I think they did a great job. We can't to do our next one. Also, once you arrive, their suites are towards the back of the parking lot.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Very good puzzles and an entertaining room altogether. Only suggestion is to provide a little more back story in the beginning to set the mood. Other then that, pair this with a dinner and you have an awesome Friday night.</review>

Was a great experience, very friendly staff, creative story line, like the seperation in the rooms in the beginning and have to work your way out to rejoin friends. The set and props were movie like along with music and the alterations of lights increasing the suspense. The puzzles were not impossible but required you to think and when solving certain puzzles, the outcome after solving it was not cheesy, for instance in movies when you lift a book a hidden wall appears (that certain instacne did not happen) and makes it much more realistic like youre in an actual movie.< /text>

My brother who is 17 was the scaredest. Over all it was a blast would definitely recommend this game/room. The scary level was a 10/10 so wouldn’t recommend ages under 10< /review>< user_name>

I've done over 10 escape rooms in San Diego and Harvest Motel is by far my favorite one! I came here for my cousin's bachelorette party and it was the perfect way to start the night. We were all terrified in the beginning as you pull in to a creepy looking motel building, but we're so glad we went through with it. Truly immersive experience from beginning to end whixh is what I personally look for in escape rooms. Without giving away too much, this room has a unique format and vibe that is different from anything I have ever done. Can't wait to come back and try their other rooms!!<//text>

Had an amazing wedding here just this year in April. Everything was awesome! The hospitality of the workers and owners, the assistance in making sure my wife and I's special day was perfect, to even the food was so dang good! I highly recommend at least coming to the venue to just walk around and see how well maintained and beautiful the property is. And if after all of that you dont want to use the venue for your big day, at least you got to see a nice sight. All in all, 5 stars for me!< /Text>

We went swimming in the Lake and walked the 14 acres of beautiful grounds. We relaxed, we had our own private yoga time. The is a beautiful venue for so many events.  It is the perfect place to host your wedding, big or small. The owners are so accommodating and friendly. We have already schedule another weekend and can't wait to go.</Review>< UserId.>

<Review>This venue is absolutely gorgeous. From the vast grounds to the barn, it was exquisite. Well kept, newly renovated, spacious areas perfect for that special day. The woman giving us the tour was able to answer all of our questions and was incredibly helpful. I look forward to attending my son and soon-to-be daughter in laws wedding here later this summer.<//Review><name>Tabitha Applebee</name>< Rate>

My husband and I got married at Springville Ranch on October 16, 2020. I had the best experience with them! Debbie was an amazing day of coordinator and made planning our big day so easy! The barn was so elegant on its own that I hardly had any decor. Highly recommend booking your wedding here!< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>My daughter chose Springville Ranch as her venue for her wedding ob January 24th 2021. Every single staff member and the owners of the venue were fantastic and made our daughter and son in law’s wedding day perfect! From the space, the decor, the food and the bride’s room and groom’s room were impeccable! A special thanks goes to Heather for supporting and caring for every need not only for our bride but for our family and our groom’s family. Heather is one in a million and we appreciate the caring concern she provided. Another remarkable special person to mention is Debbie. She not only officiated the wedding but oversaw the entire event with love and beautiful grace. Springville Ranch is the perfect combination of elegance and rustic beauty as an event venue. Thank you Springville Ranch for making our daughter and son in law’s day so very special!<//Review>< Date>

<text>Beautiful Venue!!
Had our wedding 10/12/19, could not of asked for a more perfect day. There is something about when you step on the grounds at Springville Ranch...that is peaceful and has such a good vibe. The owners and Debbie went above and beyond in making our day one to remember.  If you are looking for something special for your wedding, this is a must. We used the entire property.. married on the Bridge, cocktail hour at the gazebo,  and reception in the magical barn.  We also stayed on the property Sat night after the wedding. Our bridal parties rented out the rooms in the barn and some brought the Rvs for dry camping. ( even with a bomb fire) perfect for continuing the celebration into the night. And a plus, they do a nice lil breakfast in the am( muffins, juice, coffee, cereal.)
We highly recommend Springville Ranch!!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfd8GqxhK2HSBWPh99iStAPx3DU6Pi7k3d4GaE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH-_UboBhC788gIcT_HJyFJujp0bPn-DfPkIt3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIKPOHEq4NfbjyJNh8E0IjANjAcl2VvRdcD_Y1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn0C4p3OvutOQZauW7pYRSFBrOHqScVhs0Ejzj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPmmQO9_4alrxd7bC6KNoalQ4vCjP-rJsWsz9J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4IZOWhR7lg26mwwu9MRV2b2PIP0vY-lLVAOSA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6t15uXUY-uPAYkO8UtAQ4EK8ol1pK1edbZWOf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-G5UKoLdV_BaBGsbSL3KCbWxrR0VslJpt6Avx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIScmHyB4mn03rhQo0ULIhy6GFyeCC2Tknp_Qt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY91-qfPe20PwxgHGLWYSL_VLxM_Gnofwme0Vu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

I officiated a wedding here for the first time. It's a beautiful facility, with everything you might want. A VERY friendly and helpful staff and plenty of room for everything. With beautiful grounds, a landscaped lake and a very romantic bridge, over the lake, where the wedding was performed and the seating was. All in all, I'm hoping I get to perform many more nuptials here!<//Review>

<text>Our daughter had a gorgeous wedding on Oct. 20 2018
Ceremony on the bridge, reception upstairs in a barn.
If you have guests with walking aids you might want to let Debbie know as well as your guests that there is a lift available. I forgot to let a few of our guests know , some could not make the climb up stairs.
That was MY fail, not the SR.
We booked the Ranch almost 2 years in advance.
We used their caterer  (Teresa Fitton &  Haskell Swearingen ) our  Florist Designer the FAMOUS Daryl Walters Flower Mill.
Everything was 100%  Fantasic. I wish I could post photos (  Sonia Huckabay ) for you all to see.
There wasn’t 1  hiccup or setback,  Debbie Stengel
( Manager coordinator )  made sure everything ran very smoothly. Debbie is hands on. Debbie is the gal that will give you the answers you need in a timely manner.
There is a restroom on the main floor of the barn. Across from the SR office. Guests do not need to go upstairs to use the restroom before the ceremony.
( they only get in the way)
The downstairs suite (  bridal area ) is amazing. A lot of room.   Pleasing to the eyes & very comfortable furniture.
Bed, full kitchen & bathroom. There were about 10 of us in there and plenty of room to move about.
Upstairs in the reception area is a huge  industrial kitchen.  I only took a quick look in there.
Grooms room is upstairs along with 2 other  private bedrooms.  I can’t remeber if they all have their own private bathroom.
The grooms room - bed,  closet & private bathroom
1 public bathroom for all guests
Nicely stocked bar.
All the Businesses we used for our daughter’s wedding Were FUN and happy people to work with.
Actually Debbie along with the new owners had no problem letting Daryl do his thing. He is VERY  created if you just let him loose & let him come up with the design and stay out of his way.  You will not be sorry. Most venues have  A lot of restrictions. I felt the SR has very few ( none in my opinion )
The new owners are amazing too. I met 3 of them the day of our event. I hope I remembered their names.
Hamlet, Zack & Rick
Fun guys,  hard workers to boot. I want to go back and party with them every weekend.
You’ll find the NEW owners at the Ranch almost every weeken working hard on improvements.
I highly recommend this venue .
I wish I could give this a million stars<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

There is only one reason for my five star rating and that is Jana Walters, the amazing tax analyst I was so lucky to have assist me.  Jana was friendly, knowledgeable and time efficient.  She actually managed to make this years dreaded tax filing task not only painless but enjoyable! Crazy, right?! To be completely honest I was nervous going to HR Block because of some negative things I had heard from co workers BUT I am so happy I didn't listen to them. Clearly the experience people have with HR Block all depends on who the tax analyst is helping them. Jana Walters is a gem, she has a great attitude, she is knowledgeable and explains things as she goes in a way I could easily understand. She even cared enough to take the time to explain the Peace of Mind Plan that HR Block offers to their customers.  I really appreciated the experience she provided to me and during such a busy chaotic time of year, (I literally waiting until the last minute and busiest time). Thank you Jana Walters!</review>

I have had H & R Block prepare my returns for some years and am very pleased with the professionalism of their agents.  This year was especially positive.  Erin King is a winner.<//Text>

This is a great company. I have a family, business, own a home and 401k. H&R Block got me double what i thought i was going to get back from taxes. I have done turbotax on my own the past few yrs and i wanted to see this year if H&R Block would make a difference and they did! Like i said, H&R Block got me double what i was expecting and having young kids and a business and home i need every penny that i can get. I will only use H & R Block from here on out. I was able to make an appointment for next years taxes when i finished my appointment this year. Everything was easy and fast, i appreciate the services H & R Block provided for me and my family.</Text>

From the service area they have hot cocoa,  coffee and water for you while you wait and do your taxes.

Phone calls to set up appointments are easy and you can also set up next year's when you finish the this year.

They do have  a refer a friend were you can potentially get upto $200 or more credit/cash back with each new friend who signs up with Block. And they get a reward also.< /review></record>

<review>Never have I EVER had an experience like this trying to get my taxes done. It was so bad I’m leaving my first Google review to share it. I made an APPOINTMENT, not a walk in, not someone demanding time and services without the consideration of others- to get my taxes done. They tell me they can’t sit down with me, only drop off. Totally fine!! I just had a few questions to ask, so she asked me to ask my questions. Beautiful, all is well. At the end of my first question, they tell me they think it’s best if I do an extension, and educate me on why. Fantastic so far~ when I choose to opt out of their advice, tell them I’ve already considered all of that and would like to file anyway in order to meet my deadline and not pay for an amendment or extension, suddenly there was tension. Someone who WASNT IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM WORKING WITH ME, KNOWING MY SITUATION OR THE QUESTIONS I WAS ASKING, decided to chirp in and start giving me advice, consistently over speaking the representative I had in front of me who was actually working with me, about how busy they are right now. Then, after saying they were busy she started also suggesting that I do an extension. So I proceeded to tell this stranger who worked there my story too, and why I didn’t want to. After being visibly frustrated at my wanting to file, body language, attitude, sighing, etc. she LITERALLY IN A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE (oh yeah H&R BLOCK at this location isn’t practicing 6feet apart social distancing btw) told me “WELL look” I know right, great place to start a sentence with a customer is “Well look”- she said “Well look, we are really busy right now because of Covid and now I only have 5 staff members who have 20+ people waiting on their returns. Listening to you now, I’m not going to bump you in front of these 20 other people, and since I’m busy I won’t even be able to file your paperwork before 12am tomorrow. And so, in front of every customer since this all happened in the waiting room, I asked “so you’re telling me right now even with a scheduled appointment, even with having the legal paperwork and info I want to file- and I’m telling you I don’t care that some of my info will tax me higher, I’m making that choice to pay more here, instead of paying for an amendment or extension- even with all of that due to you feeling too busy you’re not going to file my taxes before the deadline?” I even said, I want to make sure that’s what you’re saying and she fully replied, “Well yes I’m not going to bump you in front of others.” I told her I never asked to be bumped, I never needed to hear about your work load or asked how busy you were, I’m here to pay for a service and you’re literally telling me I can pay for everything right here and now for this service yet you still will in no way file my taxes before the deadline. Again, she said no. HORRIBLE customer service, UNPROFESSIONAL attire, the woman who was talking to me like this was blonde, wore LEGGINGS with skulls all over it, and a tank top, and some flip flops. Based off how she looks what came out of her mouth shouldn’t have been so surprising. Not sure if it was Erin, or what her name was but all I know is she was the rudest, most ratchet tax analyst I’ve ever met. I’ve used H&R Block for three years now, but I’ll never be back to this location, let alone be able to get the bad taste out of my mouth with the company now based off this trashy experience. Should’ve just stayed home and used Turbo Tax< /review>< rate>

<review>Agent was extremely professional  and knowledgeable in the areas of our tax preparation. Took quite an extended amount of time to help us with our income taxes. When he did not know the answer he saw others to help him with the correct responses.</review>< Pics>

what a joke, they are not a good tax preparing company. They basically insisted that i use their debit card to get a refund, only to find out they charged me for the card! Seems like everyone in the office was new. Most of my questions they could not answer and i got more help from calling IRS, which was FREE.</Review>

<Text>I made my appointment online. The tax pro I was scheduled with seemed very new and had to get help several times from another rep in their office. I felt a bit uneasy about my taxes being done correctly and getting every deduction possible added so that I didn't owe a ton.  The gal that stepped in to help made things a tad better but overall - high anxiety. I paid extra for the Peace of Mind deal simply because I'm not 100 percent confident. What I thought would cost maybe 200 ended up being closer to 300 bucks.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809adfdd5d8279bd:0x228852175082ac6< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Great experience.  Buying ticket on-line was SIMPLE and no hassle.  You do NOT need to print ticket after buying on-line.  When the bus show's up, just show the driver your 'e-ticket' on your phone or computer, they'll scan the barcode that's on there, and it's DONE!  SIMPLE!
And NO baggage 'fee's,' that's WHY you don't need to be concernered with putting tag's on your bag's.
Security was also present and VERY visible, and a pleasure to talk with.
HOWEVER; as much as I appreciate the bus arriving EARLY, it also LEFT EARLY (by TEN minutes).  If your one of those types who like to arrive NINE minutes early ... even BEFORE it's 'schedueled' departure time, you would have been seriously S.O.L.!
You would have found yourself playing 'pick-up-sticks' with a toothless vagrant named 'Bertha' for the next 6-hour's, waiting for the next bus, wondering, "If only."< /Review>

< Review>
never in my life have i had issues with Grayhound until today. I talked with customer service for over an hour trying to fix an issue their system had. Talked with customer service personal Jeramie who understood that because of Grayhound's system issue the person i am trying to help might end up homeless. She does not care and charged me an extra $20 to fix the issue the Grayhound system had. She even said it was a system error on their side.<//Review>

<text>I tried to call the Victorville station but no answer than i called another one to reschedule my bus ride instead he wanted to charge me extra also if i wanted to come back the same day i could only stay for two hours i was going for my guard card so i had to stay for a lot longer i don't know what happened but before the bus used to come every eight hours which would of been great but now it comes maybe twice a day at least that's what the agent said from now on i will take alternate transportation maybe a taxi or uber at least you can cancel with the bus there is no refunds< /text>< Pics>

Service was okay (except for the sign outside with incorrect hours of operation), everyone I dealt with was kind, courteous and helpful. Both the inside and outside of the lobby were very clean. Bathroom was also clean and maintained.</review>

No one there, no information, unable to contact anyone, they are supposed to give you luggage tags but no one was there to do it, so our luggage was lost and you can't find any good accurate info on how to get reimbursed although if you call the company they say go to your local station. Scam. Will never EVER use Greyhound again. I wouldn't send convicted criminals on this ride.<//review>

<response>None< /response><text>Bus was 3 plus hours late.  No reason given why so late.  Station is at D street in old part of Victorville.  So many places to put a location, like Cal Logistics Airport, but greyhound picked the D street?   Next time won’t use greyhound.  I would give zero star but not possible.< /text></record>

<Review>it needs to be more convenient to its high desert residents. it opens late and closes early. no indoor seating available. only one area to charge phones. restrooms are usually clean. the one and only clerk is pleasant. the restaurant inside is yum!!! theres vending machines too. and maybe more security. there was none my last visit. my daughter saved the life of an elderly patron. she was nervous. no on site security anywhere.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Like any Greyhound depot. It is a pick up/dropped off, kind of thing. I can say the ladies room is clean as is everything there! Call before you go, I believe they close the desk for a while, daily, if you're gonna pick up a ticket!
There is a Soul Food cafe inside, I only had a coffee, it had just opened and I was finishing up my affairs.</Text><Rate>3< /Rate><user>109267636077030841748< /user>< date>

<text>Unfortunately, my first bus was delayed due to a mechanical breakdown, so I had to wait 1½ hours for the next bus to arrive, which they did make sure everyone boarded. Remember before purchasing your tickets, every driver is different, some will answer your questions & then there are those drivers who any like they can't answer and don't hands the time, so be prepared. But I can say that they will answer any questions you may have, just be sure you go inside during operating hours.<//text><user_name>Katrina Garrett< /user_name>< gmapID>

No customer sevice at all. You have a question the young girl points (and insists)   you towards the pamphlets stand(for local bus lines). No knowledge of arrival times, delays, prices or unable to guarantee you a seat. Even on my case which I had a tired and sleepy four yr old with me. Completely unaware of her surroundings as if she had just walked in for the first time. Oh but no Refunds ehhh. Pathetic Lil place I must say.<//Text>

<Name>Faith Barajas< /Name><Review>This has got to be the most awful greyhound ever. They never open on time, yet always close early. The buses are either very late, or really early to where passengers miss the bus. Customer service is garbage, the one And only employee is not friendly at all, and sometimes has her infant child there at work with her. I refuse to try the soul food restaurant inside because of the way the owner talks to people. Very rude and abrupt even to her employees,  besides they're hardly ever open anyways. We went to ask about exchanging a ticket for a different time since the bus was an hour late, and we waited at the desk for 5-10 minutes before somebody came out, and when she did she didn't look at or say anything to us,  she just pulled down and locked the security gate pretty much in our faces. Gosh i hate this place and the regular druggies and thugs that hang out here.</Review><user_id>103030093276228887201<//user_id>< date>

< review>
Busses leave way earlier than set time. I missed my bus and I was 20 minutes early hopefully theyll let me ride later on which I doubt they will because theyre greedy (no refunds). I wont know until later because they are only open 4 hours out of the day which is stupid asf. Grey hounds that im use to are 24 hours.  This grey hound sucks ass. Such an inconvenience and wate of money. Pissed. No stars<//review>

I hadn't tried Boba before and for being a first time, I absolutely love it! This is  a very charming, clean, relaxing and cozy place. Nice enough to come have a chill time with friends and family, while enjoying these great variety flavored boba drinks. The service is excellent!<//review>

<review>Bought a Thai iced tea and as I got into my car I insert the straw and accidentally tear the top part of the plastic cup spilling half of the drink all over the carpet and the dash board. I told the girl inside and she was nice enough to replace the torn cup with a new Thai iced tea.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I've been to 2 boba loca and this place has been my least favorite. I feel like they use some sort of cream that takes away from their drinks. I get green tea smoothie and sometimes feel it is missing the green tea taste and just taste like sugar. Other than that they sell more things here than other boba locas. They have pastries and snacks on the counter.</Text>< user>

<username>Osvaldo Gutierrez</username><Time>1590970378358<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>the place is very quiet, the menu is good, the only reason why I don't give it more stars is the poor service of the employees or managers of the place, I regularly buy in that place, I have done it several times, to see if I I am wrong or they do not understand what I ask, I always order a Thai tea milk boba and I ask them if they can add more milk and less tea, they always answer yes, but they never do, they are always laughing, I don't know if is for me or not, but them disrespect me, I'm not telling them to give it to me for free, I can pay for them to put more milk in it, but they don't listen, today I went, they did the same thing they added more but instead to add what I asked them to do was milk, they put coffee in my drink, I hope they can talk to the girls in that place, I would appreciate it very much</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Was the best but sadly change service and taste..and outside by the main door looks like never been mop for years ...drinks spills all over the entrance floor and the new stuff must be trained with the winning taste that they have before<//text>

This is a nice little boba shop. They have a wide variety of tea flavors and lots of delicious desserts. We had milk tea boba and it was perfect. Not too sweet and just the right amount of ice. We will be back next time we are in Downey!< /Text>

<review>My first time there my cousin took me and I had a little to much fun poking the straw into the cup... It turns out I broke a whole through the other side of the cup and it spilled all over me. The lady that was on her shift grabbed a towel and cleaned up the whole mess for me. After the cleaning she gave me a whole new drink. Thank you for the great service...❤✌</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I didn't know what I was walking into when I signed up for the 6 week challenge. I was nervous to start something new in my life but It was the best decision I ever made!
I finished my 6 week challenge and by far my experience at qfitbootcamp has been exceptional! Never have I walked into a gym before and felt comfortable about working out. The coaches are all AMAZING! Coach Yvette and Coach Elissa are there with you motivating you throughout the workout; it's the best! All the coaches genuinely want to see you achieve your goal!< /review>

Qfitbootcamp has given my body a total transformation. My lifestyle has improved dramatically because I've had the support to get healthy and because the classes are effective and fun! The coaches here genuinely care about your progress and want to see you succeed. They check in with you to help you stay accountable through many different methods (weigh ins, measurements, body fat percentage), give constant advice and feedback, and help you understand how to change your lifestyle through meal prep suggestions, mindfulness, and kick butt exercise. I truly enjoy coming here on a daily basis. Richard truly cares about you and your habits and provides the information and feedback you need to succeed.  Michael has the gift of motivation and gets to know you so that he understands how to push you to become your best self.  He is truly an amazing trainer. Sandy, Dominique, and Josh are all trainers that love what they do and bring their amazing positive energy and fun personalities to every class. The team here has all that you need to succeed. You just have to come with some determination and a willingness to not give up.<//text>

Love this gym and staff. You do not feel alienated like the big commercial gyms. The workouts, environment and access to coaches is great. If you come to this gym, come with a purpose and goal and the coaches will help you achieve it. 👍</text>

Great fitness place!  Love the Coaches and personal training.  No extra charge for the personal training or nutrition advice.  Worth the monthly charge.  7 days free trial.  This is someone who hated going to the gym, love this place.< /Review>

I used to love going to qfit.  They were always pricey compared to other gyms.  Then there was a change after they got voted best in high desert.  They started charging more and more.  The small group they offered was $150 for twice a week which is ridiculous.  I actually left a couple months ago.  When I signed my cancellation Michael was rude to me.  Now my friend told me they upped there prices again and gave everyone a 3 days notice.  Mostly everyone quit and today they let go there best trainer.  The owners are nothing but money hungry.  Not only that but it's a very toxic enviroment.  I am glad I left and went to legends.  Save money and go somewhere else.<//Text>

<Text>I just finished my 6 week challenge and the only reason I was successful, was due to the support and accountability they provide. Qfit is the best workout support system I have ever had! It’s not just a gym, the other girls and the trainers are so encouraging, pushing you to go farther and train harder each and every day.< /Text><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

I started going to Qfit on October 2016 and was nervous to start something new.  When I got there the environment was friendly and welcoming. Coach Richard was real helpful getting me started with everything I needed to know. Coach Michael is a great coach who has a great attitude everyday. The coaches are quick to respond when I have any questions I have regarding nutrition or any other concern. I am so glad I started because it truly has changed my life.< /Text>

<text>I will be forever grateful to the QFit family! This was the first time EVER that I was able to start a health/fitness plan and see it through till the end. I did the 6 week challenge to help get motivated to taking better care of myself. I felt like I had lost myself along the way somewhere over the years. I’m a foster parent with a full time job and during week 2 of the 6 week challenge we were placed with a special needs infant. It was difficult to say the least. We now had 4 boys at home that required a lot of love and attention and I thought my workouts were going to have to be put on the back burner. However, I really wanted to see this through so I talked with some of the staff about my struggles and they supported me and cheered me on!

With the help of the AMAZING coaches here who greet you by name, workout alongside you while correcting your form and technique, create an individualized easy to follow nutrition plan and guide that is super simple and inexpensive, (and also picked up my crying baby and held him for the duration of the class so I could focus on my workout/goal 🙌💞) ...Thanks to them and this wonderful program I was able to reach my fitness goal! They go above and beyond and I feel they genuinely want to see you reach your goals! They held me accountable and motivated me with in person check ins, texts, emails and phone calls which is exactly what I needed! In 6 weeks I lost 5% body fat and 13.5 pounds!!! QFit bootcamp literally changed my life! And it can change yours too. Don’t hesitate to give them a try. You won’t regret it!

(Special thank you to Tabitha, Michael, Yvette, and Alyssa! You guys were personally a huge part of me getting to where I am and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you do at QFit)< /text>< gmap_id>

Been with qfitbootcamp for almost 2 years now. Richard the owner is always there if you have questions or need additional help. The trainers just want you to succeed and push you to do your best. This place has a wonderful welcoming atmosphere to all levels of fitness. I have personally grown my endurance and have even surprised myself with my strength and willpower. Qfit is wonderful and just I love my fitness family!! 2 years strong!</Text>

I had been "trying" to loose weight for 7 months  and was never motivated to get up and do something about it. After going to qfitbootcamp for one week i became obsessed. No one there judges you by how much you weigh.  if you are struggling to do a workout so many of the  members and  the trainers  help you. I lost 4 pounds the first week and now i also am noticing my clothes are fitting me differently. I am so happy to say i am going to continue going back!</review>

<Text>I just completed my 6 week challenge and man! Let me tell you, I've never been so motivated and proud of myself. QFit has seriously changed my life for the better! I've gained so much insight and knowledge on what to workout for my body to lose weight and what to eat for my body to stay HEALTHY! The coaches are so amazing and there for you each step of the way, it is a great feeling whenever you walk into a place of fitness and feel like family rather than a stranger and feeling self conscious. I was on the fence at first but I am SO glad I was able to participate in such a beneficial, powerful and rewarding bootcamp such as QFit! Highly recommend this location for any ladies searching for a new, healthy and positive chapter in their lives.💖< /Text>< resp>

<review>I've been a member at Qfitnessbootcamp for about 2 months now, and I have noticed my strength progressing in such little time as I have at a regular gym in the past in 1year! The coaches are amazing to say the least and really push you to be the best you could be. Pushing us through our workouts when they know we need it, as well as always giving us nutritional advise when needed. It really is a total package at this gym, and I see myself being part of the qfitnessbootcamp fam for a LONG time. Thank you coach Michael, Sally and Richard! 💪🏻😀</review><Date>1498275092366</Date></record>

<Review>I started my journey April 2016 and by the end of July I lost about 17 lbs...I started eating what ever I wanted on weekends and stopped losing weight...I maintained my weight up until the end of October that's because I stopped going to the bootcamp and I stopped my nutrition as well...I gained almost all my weight back and talked to Richard about wanting to come back and he encouraged me to go back...I started the bootcamp again the end of February 2017...On my day back I talked to coach Michael and told him my struggle...he helped me find the motivation that I was lacking before and he keeps me on track and tells me as I am working out the reason why I am trying to better myself...So far I have lost 36lbs and I am 2 lbs away from my initial goal I had set for myself last year...My starting weight in February was 173lbs and as of today 137lbs...The best part of the bootcamp is the environment...Everyone is a teamplayer and we will help motivate each other...Thank you Richard for giving us different meal plans to help reach our goals and for answering all my nutritional questions...Thank you coach Michael for helping me reach my goal...I honestly don't think I could have done this AMAZING weight loss without your support and thanks for pushing me through my workout when I am wanting to stop...Coach Sandy thanks for pushing me through the workouts and for doing them with me when I have wanted to stop...This bootcamp has HONESTLY made me Stronger💪, Leaner and most importantly it made me love Myself ❤</Review><gmap_id>0x80c36623013fdfc9:0x9d6fe46bcac04fe3< /gmap_id><Time>1498334594275<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Qfit bootcamp changed my life!!! The coaches are awesome!! I suffer from bad knees and they modify the routines in order for me to be able accomplish my goals. Coach Richard truly cares for all the members and takes his time giving us helpful advice to have a healthy lifestyle. Coach Michael, coach Sandy, coach Josh and coach  Dominique push you to not give up and they make you feel comfortable. All the ladies push each other and they don't make you feel out of place. I can truly say that this is my happy place!! I would recommend qfit bootcamp to anybody!!! Best bootcamp in the HD and I have gone to a few!

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I reached a point in my life where I decided I couldn’t stand how overweight I was. I chose QFit Bootcamp because it wasn’t the typical gym and it’s for women only.  The last thing I wanted to do was be self-conscious about my looks. At QFit you don’t have to figure out what exercises go with what muscle groups and whether you’re doing the right routines to hit all areas of your body.  QFit does it for you; just show up and work out at your own pace and level at each station of the circuit. Richard Parga is also about providing information on nutrition, health and motivation.  Michael Ramirez and Dominique Ramirez are awesome as persons and coaches, they push you to do your best, but don’t overstep.  I started January 2 and have been consistent in going and have lost 20 pounds, 9 inches overall and 2% body fat – oh and I’m 54 years young. I highly recommend QFit Bootcamp.</Text>< pictures>

Delicious unique fresh tasting rolls! You have to get it all! When it comes to Sushi the first thing I look for is freshness, that's key! This restaurant does it best. Flavors are amazing. The seaweed salad could use a little bit more vinegar otherwise amazing. The Yum Yum roll, the house roll, the Alaskan roll, Las Vegas roll,   they're all great! Don't forget to get a bottle of sake for the table, it's a must! The service is amazing, great staff friendly owner very accommodating and hospitable. Love coming here time and time again.<//Text>

At the first moment  you enter this restaurant  they give you an agreeable feeling. Very hospitable crew, it is a kind restaurant to go out with buddies or with your date. tasty  cooking, talented  chef de cuisine, modest  pay and professional  service. Highly recommended.</text>

<review>Absolutely horrible. The sushi was real good. The sushi chef is obviously a well trained. But the owner cooks as well and he is horrible. He doesn't speak English and has made EVERY order wrong. He and his wife spend most of the time arguing and it slow very awkward. The waitress is super nice, but the owners ruin it especially Jack the owner. I saw their fish delivery truck and was shocked at the smell.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>if you think this place is good and there service you have absolutely no clue what good sushi or service is. first of all way overpriced for quality of fish. second misleading menu in regards to there rolls. I  paid $35 for a misled description of there tiger roll. there chicken katsu lunch was ok I might give it a 2.5 star. but all in all I left and gave my food to a homeless man. dont waste your money< /Text>< Pictures>

Pizza is always very delicious. I think they use quality ingredients so it makes a difference. They have great service and offer good deals for pizza and wings 👍</review>

I have always order from this spot since back in my High school days, price is great, taste is 90% of the time is great, average delivery time, BUT what makes this great is the flavor that this pizza has against their bigger competitors,wing can normally use a few more minutes of actual cooking but pizza is always spot on.</text>

The pizza is pretty good, but their delivery service sucks! First they told me that they wouldn't deliver to me (I'm less than 3 miles away), then I called back and said they could do it if I doubled my order and waited 45 minutes.. The price is "eh".< /review>

<Text>My friend order from you guys on Friday August 4th, 2017. I hadn't had ANY type of 2 for 1 since the mid 90's and I had at the time no idea she was ordering from you. I had my first bite and fell in LOVE. I had to know where this pizza was from! I will be ordering from you from now on. You had just the right amount of everything. I just wish you were closer so I could ride my medical scooter to you rather then calling for delivery. Thanks for changing my mind on 2 for 1 pizza. 1<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c29c60de0da1d3:0xe65d7a1109fa567a< /Gmap_id><UserId.>115372146978719136897</UserId.><Time>1502078703044< /Time><name>Julie Leon</name></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) A bald worker there ... who has not a bit of education ... treated us badly ...
We were eating next door, and he came out screaming and demanding that we move the cars that why were they theirs ... he did it in a bad way

(Original)
Un trabajador pelón de ahí... que no tiene ni una poca de educación... nos trató mal...
Estábamos comiendo al lado, y salió gritando y exigiendo que moviéramos los carros que por qué eran de ellos... lo hizo de una mala manera< /Text>

Michael is the apartment manager and he lives on site. I feel like I could come to him if I had any problems and he would respond. The neighbors are so nice and everyone here gets along and respects each others space and property.< /Text>< Rating>

Worst company ever. Science the new owner started contract/management with them the only thing they have done is nothing. The building is coming apart.  They don't pay attention to any of my complaints.The pictures will show how the kitchen counter is coming apart the bathroom has it's walls humid  that I have said that is bad for my sons asthma. The carpet is a mat that every time I vacuum pieces of it come of. The nice pictures is the work I have done to the apartment out of my pocket I have painted,fixed many of the things in the apartment cause I don't like to live like a pig. I have lived in the property for more thn 10 years and now they even want to charge for trash,water,pet control,sewer what is this am I buying the apartment??? Why should I pay for water when I don't do laundry in the building. The building is not even next to a tourist area I used to pay for all that when I live two blocks away from Disneyland. The owner should take in consideration what I have done for his apartment. I say if your going to start charging me for all that put a good security system cause many of my stuff has been stolen from my storage and I have found homeless people sleeping between the cars in the parking area. The company is taking advantage.  I will like to speak to the owner. If not I'm going to star holding back on rent.<//Text>

<Text>Diana Álvarez, is my property management here at 676 Shatto Place, she has been, such a great blessing to me and my family with our needs, when it comes to repairing our apartment, with our billings situation, maintenance and security of our building. She’s very respectful, kind, professional, full of knowledge and resourceful and helpful. I hope, that beach front property management company values and appreciate her because without her, this building wouldn’t be such a great place to live in, especially in such times as the ones that were living in this present time! GOD BLESS YOU, Diana!< /Text>< Pics>

I've been searching for an apartment with all the ammenities for nearly 3 1/2 weeks-then I found the one that Mike Casillas was showing and fell in love. It was everything and more than I expected (I even walked around the neighborhood and met some friendly people so that alone shows what a great area it's in)! If it wasn't for Mike's patience, hard work, and dedication I feel this unit will be gone before I know it. Praying all goes smooth as the rental application process (I believe) is coming towards an end and I can call this place my new home.<//Text>

Alejandra Rodriguez as my manager is the most responsible manager I had ever had and over the past 5 years she always answers my calls the moment I make the phone call. The property is always on perfect condition and very clean everyday of the week. Alejandra as my manager is very helpful and understanding. She is always making sure that people aren't dealing with any problems with there apartment unit.This is why I give Beach Front Property Management a 5 star rating. I live in 1021 N Flower St. Santa Ana.< /Text>

If I can give beach front property negative stars in every rating site I find trust that I definitely will!

My vehicle was vandalized on Tuesday 11/24/2020 around 2 am. I am parked directly in front of a camera in my assigned tenant parking for which I am charged a monthly rent on.

When I reported this to the police, the police officer even said that this should be a slam dunk considering the fact that I am parked directly in front of a camera.

That was until I asked my manager for the video footage, what I was shown was nothing outside of  shameful negligence from not only my manager but the property management for not being on top of her in regards to these “security” cameras.

You are unable to see pretty much anything at night from these camera (they work just fine during the day) due to lack of maintenance & cleaning of them.

The manager herself admits that in the 3+ years that she has been on site these cameras have not only not been cleaned/inspected/maintained/serviced she is well aware of them NOT working at night.

She herself has had her car also vandalized & yet even then did nothing to repair these cameras. When I reported this directly to the management company the manager herself called me not even 10 minutes later accosting me for calling them denying she ever said anything that I has listed above.

This management is so quick to take our rent yet when it comes to maintenance issues & basic upkeep/repairs has no desire to do their due diligence. I could honestly deal with it because we are able to do some of the repairs ourselves rather than their Mickey Mousing when they do show up but this vandalism & honest lack of integrity on their part was really the last straw.

If things change & these avoidable issues / concerns are addressed then I will happily update however until then PEOPLE DO NOT RENT HERE!

I have had so many neighbors tell me that they feel deceived by this management & what they are told/shown when they are applying is no where near what they have experienced since moving in.< /text>

I am a Tenant at The Adelphi Apartments In Anaheim and I have 5 years living here, and this is the first time Adelphi Apartments has a manager that does her job. The Building is super clean and so are the parking lots. We now have a amazing garden in front. We no longer have any problems with our maintenance orders or how to pay the rent. We are very happy with having Aquelina Farias as a manager. Thank you beachfront properties😌< /Text>

This complex is pretty old, so we expected that it will have some issues when moved in 2010. Slow response on any much needed repairs.  For instance, we had a leaking faucet in the bathroom, took them a month to send someone to atleast look at it. We ended up just repairing it ourselves. So By the time maintenance came, it was fixed already. Two positive thing i can say about this place that it is spacious for 1 bedroom, and they keep it pretty clean. The new manager we have now seems to be cool and responsive. So hopefully 🙏 it will continue to improve.< /review>

I was looking for an apartment as I just moved to Anaheim and found this to be a very pleasant and clean location. The manager, Aquelina, was very informative, kind, and professional, she answered all my questions and concerns. I'm glad to have found this place, was my first choice and last. I recommend!</Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>Negatives:

1. False advertising - the pool area is indefinitely closed.

My initial apartment tour was over Facetime with the manager where it was not mentioned that the courtyard/pool area was closed. They advertise beautiful photos & videos of this amenity and it was the sole reason I chose to live there after countless hours of researching apartment communities in Long beach.

I asked the manager when they plan to open this area asking for detailed reasons (like a specific regulation in LA county needs to be lifted or a certain number of positive COVID cases) but he didn't have an explanation. Recently said the owners will "possibly" open the courtyard area in the summer. We never received a reduction in rent or any courtesy letter from management/owners for this inconvenience.

2. False sense of security.

My vehicle was vandalized and broken into one morning around 6AM. I was parked directly in front of a camera in my assigned tenant parking for which I was charged a monthly fee on. I reported this to police and they asked for this security footage. When I asked the manager he said that none of the cameras on the property actually work so there was no footage. He also said that there had been 6 other recent car break ins at another property (as if that would make me feel better).  Wish he would've sent out a message to his tenants warning us of this crime pattern.

Positives: The location is really nice, in a good neighborhood and walking distance to the beach.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Quality of living has dropped since this company's purchase of our apartment complex that I am currently living in. I have sent multiple complaints about the next door neighbor exccesive smoking (heavy merajana smell and smoke). Not to mention the constant domestic violence between the couple (yelling and screaming physical altercations pounding on the walls) for which on one of the 20 occasions I've called th police the male was taken into custody. I do not sleep in between my two jobs and my children listen to their fighting and smell the smoke from their gross smoking addiction, windows have to be shut at all times because their smoking is at random. Beachfront Properties failure to enforce the basic regulations is why I am currently looking for a different apartment to move to for which I will be requesting moving expenses. Meanwhile I will continue to stay current on my monthly payments as I do not wish to have my credit effected even though this company does not deserve it.</review>

I am so happy with Jose L Cortez a tech with beachfront, he was very good and fast in repairing my water leak. I didn’t even have to miss work like I thought I would. He made sure all my concerns were looked at and also did a great job. I am very pleased with all he did. Thank you very much.</Text>

<text>After thinking long and hard about this I am actually going to change my rating to five stars the reason why is because my biggest complaint with Beach Front was my move-in due to a past employee not processing my paperwork correctly and feeling like the company was dragging their feet however I have been in constant communication with king and he has been very attentive to our needs plus any time we’ve had a work order issue we have always gotten an immediate response and things have been fixed correctly the move-in was rough but Beach Front is coming and it’s been led by someone who truly cares about their residence king wells – Ramirez I recommend Beach Front now that they’ve gotten things in order<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1604592761953, 'text': 'Hi Kianna - thank you so much for your 5-star review of Beach Front Property Management and specifically King.

Poor customer service, response time, and overall management. The property on 19th street in Long Beach is roach infested with a very insecure and unpleasant assistant to the property manager by the name of Celene. Even if you pay rent on time and stay to yourself, you will constantly be bothered. No parking, last minute renovations. One of my neighbors was a peeping tom, and they also held on to half of my security deposit. Save yourself the time and headache and go with another property management company.</Review>

I called the emergency after our number not knowing that it was for emergency work orders. So there was no contact until Monday when I contacted the office it was verified that no one was authorized to enter there was no emergency with my neighbor or other units I asked them what they were going to do about it they informed me that there was nothing they were going to do about it I was appalled they were not concerned that someone illegally entered my unit. I did make a police report, there didn't seem to be anything missing that I could tell as of yet. Back to Management I'm being told there is nothing they can do, my privacy has been violated on their watch and they're being nonchalant about the whole situation I am furious!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1604966644600, 'text': 'Hi Yolanda - We are terribly sorry to hear about your recent experience and would like to learn more about the situation so we can correct the issue asap.

Experience with this property management was awful. Move in was totally messed up. Nothing done to make up for it. Fortunately on site management changed and things got better. However, never felt like maintenance was responsive, did not feel safe, apartment grounds were always unkempt, and the final indignity was withholding some of our security deposit for things the management should be responsible for anyway—nothing in the lease agreement says we are responsible for getting apartment ready for next tenant. This is the worst property management I have ever had to deal with. WE HAD WAY TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH COCKROACHES. I feel so bad for my son who had to spend his first years here.

Beach Front property management have been very professional with great staff that are always there when I need them.

I will make this very short
The property that I moved into on 7th street had things that were wrong with it. I moved in anyway. After I moved in. They took 600 out of my deposit to buy new stuff and paint after I moved out
They take your DEPOSIT MONEY and buy things for the apartment after you move out. DO NOT BUY OR RENT FROM!!!< /Text>

<time>1596161232785< /time><Review>This company wants to increase rent to tenants during the Covid19 pandemic. They expect payments no matter what. They do not take into consideration that there are a lot of people without jobs due to this ongoing pandemic in the whole world mostly in the United States and the state of California.  Plus they also expect bills to be pay separately. They are not a friendly understanding company for sure. They are taking advantage of the necessity of people's to have a roof over their heads. They do not care if you have to stop buying groceries to be able to comply to their outrageous rent increases. Unfairness all over the board. And of course they don't care because they are not suffering. I bet they don't have to worry about losing their home or worry about where their kids are going to sleep or eat.  This must be illegal they are money greedy.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

Best third-party property management company in Los Angeles, hands down. What I think sets Beach Front Property Management, Inc from so many other property management companies is that they actually INCREASE cashflow to apartment building investors (or who, I am one). How? The company implements a Ratio Utility Billing Service (RUBS) with all of its’ property management clients (even for small buildings) as part of the on-boarding process. Literally saves over 20% on utility expenses. Genius.<//text>

<Review>Beachfront properties, located on Marine Avenue, is by far one of the best apartment complexes I've lived in California. My first great experience was the fact that the property manager, 'Marlo', answered the phone on the second ring, which is very rare for apartment complexes. Usually you have a difficult time contacting anyone, and if you do, they give you such a run around.. and/or risk getting scammed. That was not the case here, Marlo is very knowledgeable, professional, extremely patient and pleasant to deal with. She even waited for me when I got lost and was running late to view the apartment. Anytime I call to ask for a specific request, no matter how little, she's always on top of it. Also, the turn around  for maintenance is very quick . Additionally, this apartment complex is very quiet, even on a Friday or a Saturday night where you would expect there to be some type of noise, not at all here. The Landscaping keeps the pool very clean, the grounds are very clean,  and  the gates are always secure. I get home very late at night most often and I never feel unsafe walking to my apartment . Every single neighbor that I've encountered has been very respectful and kind even if I don't know them personally. I would recommend this place for anyone to make this their home. I plan on staying here for quite some time.</Review></record>

<text>I have lived at the Beach front property located on Marine ave  for almost 1 year. It is the best apartment complex I have lived in since moving to California. It’s quiet, all the neighbors stay to themselves, the pool is always clean the landscaping is always keep up. And The property manager Marlo is absolutely the best. She is easy to get in contact, personable, is never in your business and she responds to maintenance request with in 24hours.

Beach Front took over very suddenly at the complex we were living in. Firstly, communication was poor. Took me multiple weeks to get word on our lease about moving out and then to pay the rent through them after taking over, which wasn't fun either as their building in downtown wasn't clearly labeled.

Second, they failed to upkeep the grounds. The shrubbery grew over and attracted SO MANY BEES, the laundry areas looked gross, and the pool gate malfunctioned - only to be locked with a padlock and not fixed.

Third, they charged us for cleaning after move out even though the apartment was clean. We understand that it has to be done but it seemed excessive to keep almost our entire security.

The only positive piece I have to say is King was the only one to return my calls promptly and helped us out. We would not have used them again.< /Review>

<Text>Best apartment I have ever lived in. Usually it's a hassle to get in contact or communicate to someone about my needs for my apartment. But I have the sweetest landlord ever, and it has been a breeze getting my apartment fix. The process of everything has been transparent and easy.< /Text>< Pics>

His professionalism is unmatched, and as a woman, that is of the UTMOST importance. He communicates exactly what he needs to do; he's attentive to every detail; he doesn't lolly-gag; and he leaves nothing left undone. When the job is finished, Rene asks, "Is there anything else I can do for you?" That's so refreshing! Why? Because it shows the level of his commitment to YOUR  satisfaction. He's the BEST, and I'm SO glad we have him as our maintenance guy. 😁😁😁</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My experience with Beachfront property management has been great.
The manager, Mr. Thompson, makes sure we are aware of any changes to the property and listens to concerns acting on them promptly. The area is kept clean and groomed making neighbors feel at home.  I would highly recommend anyone I know to reside in my building in Inglewood.
Thanks,< /Review>

< review>
Me and mother have been living in the same complex for nearly 5 years.  I have to say i'm glad that I live in a beautiful building with a hard working manager. The manager cleans Monday to Friday for at least 5 hours and has a other building to clean after. The building complex is always clean and the management is fairly simple but it might change in the following month. When Beach Front Property took over the management there were some issues but those issues are now in the past and the company is improving day by day. I'm looking forward being with the company in the future and having a great time living here.

P.S: For my Hard working, loving and beautiful Mother<//review>

<Text>This apartment complex is simply amazing! The units are nestled in a very quiet area of Torrance and surrounded by a cool ocean breeze. The grounds at the location are ALWAYS kept clean and the staff is polite, approachable and attentive.

Speaking of staff, I cannot say enough about the facilities on-site manager, Beatriz. Since moving in almost 6 months ago, Beatriz has been nothing but great. She is a dedicated employee that goes above and beyond to ensure the facility is kept clean, ensure ALL repairs are made in a timely manner and ensure all renters needs are met.

Beatriz has help me out on more than one out occasion and I truly appreciate her diligence and follow through. Thank you Beatriz for making my stay here truly feel like home.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>We lived at one of their properties in La Habra for 3 years and were very satisfied! The managers, Mike and Judi, were so wonderful and easy to work with! They were quick about fixing any issues we had.
Only drawback was how much rent would increase each year at renewal despite having been good renters. But the management was by far the best we have dealt with.<//review>< rate>

<review>I just want to start by saying I have NEVER, in my life met a woman so incredibly caring, understanding and patient. My rental process was very lengthy (to say the least) and in no way Veronica Pulido’s fault, and from start to finish, she was so sweet and patient throughout the whole process. I consider myself honored to have found such a special and dedicated manager. Thank u Beach front property’s for making your property our beautiful home...VERONICA PULIDO IS THE VERY BEST AT WHAT SHE DOES, BELIEVE ME! 😊</review></record>

< Review>
I have a chronic illness, which caused me to get way behind on my rent. Right when I finally was able to go back to work, so I could start paying back what I owe, ,the lockdown, quarantine  so I really couldn’t go to work. I was only able to move half of my things, considering I’ve been there 25 years so I accumulated alot of things. Just when I made arrangements to FINALLY get the rest of my things, just Just to find out today that they threw my belongings away! I was supposed to be notified I found out but no one ever called me. I  cried for the longest! I had items that could never be replaced from my grandmother and I just couldn’t believe that they just couldn’t give me a heads up and I would’ve did everything to try and get my stuff out! They said I abandonEd my apartment I would never do that! like I said I’ve been there 25-26 years! With all that’s going on in the world today, I can’t believe that people would be this cruel!< /Review>

I've lived at the Rolling Hills Apartments for about 6 years now; between my time here and past places I have rented, I have a good amount of experiences with both landlords and property managers. I can say confidently without fear of contradiction that Beatriz Ferreira is an exceptional property manager. I cannot overstate how helpful she has been since she started managing this property a few years ago. She is responsive, caring, and always available. Beatriz is a huge reason why I am staying put! Thanks, Beatriz for all you do and thanks to the ownership that keeps you at our complex.<//text>

My husband and I have been living in the same complex for about a year or so. In until recently beach front property took over the units and I have to say it has been the best thing that could happen. We had some issues that had been pending for repair since before BFP took over but as soon as I let our property manager Ashley know about them she moved quick and resolved these issues. She's very well with communication makes sure all our questions are answered. Great job Ashley :)< /Text>

I was working with a property manager by the name of Cesar and he answers texts a week later , makes an appointment with you and he nevers shows up , very unprofessional.  This place is a joke , they make you fill out paperwork and pay a fee and then they are gone . Don't use this place its kind  of a scam if you ask me .</review>

<Text>I have loved Rolling Hills Apartments for almost a decade, I cant believe it's been that long! After living there for over 6 years (in first a 1 bedroom by myself,  then upgrading to a 3 bedroom after starting a family ). Because of how safe and well cared for I have always felt in this complex , I decided to move back after a cross country move that did not work out. As a young single girl it was a perfect place to grow and thrive,  and as a mother with my little girl moving back cross country there is no where else I could imagine living. Cynthia was wonderful back in the beginning,  and Beatriz has been just as approachable,  friendly , and accommodating :)
The maintenance team is as helpful and sweet as the management. Jose and Humberto are on top of anything that needs fixing and flash friendly smiles whenever we cross paths. I love the family oriented atmosphere and the pet friendly attitude as well! Just a wonderful place for every phase of life. I joke around that I may live there forever :)<//Text><GmapID>0x80dd3390a16b70a9:0x341b585bd4aca995<//GmapID>< user_id>

I was overwhelmed with the process of finding a new apartment. Marlo was incredibly patient, kind and knowledgeable about every detail. She went above and beyond what a regular Property manager would do. It’s evident she not only enjoys her job but truly cares for her clients.<//Review>

I used to have a different property owner (they shall remain unnamed), and I am so glad Beach Front took over! I had problems for years that my previous owner just ignored that were resolved in like 2 weeks.  It makes your life so much better when your home is comfortable, and you know your property manager has your back.  Thank you Beach Front!<//text>

Joulene at 950 W Beach is AMAZING! She is the major factor in my review. When she moved in she turned the whole environment around. No trash, no people hanging out drinking/smoking. She is always so helpful. Always helps to get maintenance requests completed quickly. Great at helping to mediate neighbor issues. Give the woman a raise!<//Review>

Rene, was really really helpful nice positive & just real homey and he TALKED! I don’t know about you guys but I like to communicate with people being in silence is just not social to me. He fixed/replaced the things I needed taken care of in my apartment and everything went really smoothly. I never felt so confident, certain, and comfortable with feeling like I can call on someone for maintenance... and if in the future I need something done again i definitely won’t hesitate to call him!</text>

Beach front property management helped manage my apartment building in Redondo Beach, and with vacancies constantly coming around, it was great to have a property management company be on top of filling those vacancies as soon as possible. Loss of vacancy was important for me, and in addition, various other matters arose at my property that would have been a real issue for me to deal with in person. They handled these matters correctly and diligently through property management staff. I'd like to take the time to recommend beach front property management for anyone looking for a property management company that takes care of their clients.<//text>

Oh man, I can’t say enough good things about this company. Our house has been top notch, primo location near the beach, and we had a small mold issue (happens in beach properties) that got addressed THE NEXT DAY after I emailed my property manager. I have never had service like this with other landlords/ladies, I would recommend beach front over a traditional set-up in a heartbeat.</text>

The neighborhood and neighbors are quiet and friendly. The entire property was renovated this past year with new appliances, hardwood floors, countertops, etc. It is a very quaint property, that I absolutely love living in. The property manager, Marlo, has been one of the most professional and diligent property managers I have dealt with. She always responds to requests and concerns within 24 hours (usually she responds within 30mins to a few hours!), so I never feel like an issue will go unresolved. She goes above and beyond to make sure the residents have live in a safe, secure, clean, and functional environment. Thanks for the hard work and making Carnegie Ln a great place to live< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< Time>

My wife and I are in process of moving out and I just want to share my experience with living at one of Beach Front Property Management’s properties in Manhattan Beach. Our property manager was amazing! Every time we had a problem we simply called him and it was addressed quickly. It’s a shame we have to relocate but we are grateful for our time at this property.</Review>

Came to visit Arlington Gardens and the property manager Robert was welcoming. The renovations look great and I can’t wait to see the finished product. Robert was friendly and professional. I look forward to the completed renovation and making my final decision soon.< /Text>

We took apartment as is, so no new carpet.. no new kitchen.. even found beer cans in cupboards.. but we got $50 a month  off our rent so we agreed. We got 3 rent increases and not a single improvement.. We have reached out to Carolyn in upper field and no results. I have a broken garbage disposal since January and now we are in middle of March and no repairs have been done. The water that leaks out is black A D smelly and of course attracts gnats! And I have texts messages back and forth to show my efforts to get this done. The manager eventually stopped replying and resorted to ignoring me. The manager is never on premises to let the maintaince man in and we work. I took days off to sit home and wait for nothing! This company is extremely frustrating and the revolving door of on site managers is absurd. Every 6 months is a new manager and a new waiting list to get on to just get a walk through of repairs needed. Carpet is so torn apart we have to wear slippers to avoid nails in our feet! We pay 1,295.00 and can't seem to get any attention!< /text>< Resp>

This review is concerning my interactions between my apartment manager Christina at the Country Club Apartments in Downey.  I recently moved out of my apartment of over 3.5 years.  I enjoyed my time there.  She was the best apartment manager I’ve had. And believe me, I’ve had a lot of them.  With her assistance, I was able to resolve any issues or requests for repairs I had.  So, if you are looking for a new place to call home in California? Take a look at the apartments at Country Club Apartments.  I had a two bedroom apartment which had a host of amenities.  I don’t believe you would have issues with space in these apartments. The complex offers extra storage at the garage covered ports. You can also get some exercise at the complex's swimming pool. There's never a need to worry about the safety of your vehicle because covered and non-covered parking is available for residents; you won’t be disappointed!<//review>

Management is quick to respond to requests and follows up with maintenance. Marlo always responds to my emails, calls and requests promptly. Properties are kept clean and up to date. Convenient online rent payment options make it easy to pay bills on time. The leasing process is quick and painless. Overall, I would recommend this management company to rent a property from.< /Text>

Just moved into the Gardens on Arlington apartment with the help of our manager Robert Rodriguez. He was super helpful throughout the entire process of our move-in.

Chelsea is an excellent property manager! In addition to keeping the building in tip-top shape, she’s a consummate professional who responds immediately to inquiries/issues. Icing on the cake? She’s friendly and upbeat. We’re lucky to have her—as-is Beach Front Property Management. Thank you, Chelsea!</Text>

I have lived for over 1 year at Rolling Hills Apartments at 25935 Rolling Hills Rd.
Manager Beatriz Ferreira has always been very attentive, responsive to any questions, very dedicated and responsible for her work.  It’s very nice to know that I have a manager always concerned about the welfare of its tenants. There are so many apartments and she can be lovely to all, this is really admirable!
Thank you Bia for your impeccable work!
You are excellent 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<//Review>

<Time>1544039322451<//Time><Review>I had the pleasure of renting from Beach Front Properties a couple years ago. In my opinion it was a great experience. They were very attentive and friendly. Michelle Rodriguez (the property manager) was very welcoming and kind. Unfortunately I had to relocate to move in with a girlfriend but if I ever move back to Torrance, I will most definitely contact them to see if they have any vacancies. Thanks so much for the year I spent living at your property. Hopefully talk to you guys soon!!!!

Anybody looking for a place I highly suggest you rent from Beach Front Properties!

This review is for Angelica M. She is my current manager at 7301 E Florence ave. She is amazing. She took over the building about 8 months ago and it was the best thing that could have happened to us. It's always clean, parking is no longer an issue, it's quiet and she's always available on the phone. That's beach front for this great change on manager.< /Text>

I have been living in the Beach front property management for almost 3years now in the 1021 n flower Santa Ana CA area. I like how the manager is on sight and living in the apt complex,makes it really easy to contact her. Alejandra Rodriguez is my apt manager and she is super super nice and understanding. I really enjoy living here it's very peaceful and clean. Thank you for keeping a neat environment for our family.  :)<//Review>

We have lived at the Crestwood apartments for over 20 years and have had a few managers, and of all of them, Veronica Pulido has been the best one. She treats us like family. Whenever I have a problem, she takes care of it right away. She's very considerate and well mannered and has a great personality, something that slot of managers don't have.<//Review>

<Review>Angelica who is the new property manager here at my apt which I moved in a month ago is so professional, respectful and straight forward..  she's a woman of her word, she makes sure every unit is up to par before renting, I always see her involved with the maintenance workers outside.. she also keeps the outside clean  herself as well as the laundry room... She responds to inquires in a timely matter, and gets the job done immediately. .. thankful that I ran into her...   Since she is hired Under beach front properties, that means beach front properties is doing an amazing job with their management hiring and also responding to her in a timely matter as well!

When our building was undergoing major renovation in 2017 through 2018, the property was in a state of semi-chaos from time to time due to the extensive construction in progress. Fortunately, Courtney was there when we needed someone to answer questions and take care of the numerous this-and-thats which came up during the construction project. Thanks to Courtney, we all came through it intact and she’s still here as the resident manager taking care of the numerous things that are bound to happen from time to time. Beach Front Property Management is fortunate to have her as an employee and we are fortunate to have her as our resident manager.< /Text>< Rate>

We've lived at Pickering Apts at 5837 Pickering Ave Whittier for nearly a year now.  The manager, Johanna Evans, is very sweet and makes you feel welcome from the on-set.  If anything needs to be tended to she gets to it right away.  I think she does a great job, as  the grounds are clean and well-kept, it's quiet, and all-in-all, a very pleasant place to live. Thanks Johanna.  You're awesome!</text>

I recently moved out of an apartment managed by Beach Front Property. The property changed management and ownership half way through the lease, so I would understand some confusion in the shuffle, but they have been beyond incompetent.

They were prompt in scheduling the move out walk through,  but my deposit is nearly a month late at this point. I've followed up countless times by phone and email, only to be ignored or refereed to someone else who is just as unhelpful.

In short, you can count on them to be on top of anything pertaining to their direct interests, but if you need assistance or are owed anything, don't hold your breathe.<//text>

My experience has been great dealing with the manager at Firestone Apartments. I had many questions and every time I asked the manager Luz was always very helpful and got back to me within a reasonable amount of time. I know that if I ever need anything from the management it will be taken care of.</Review>

My review is in regards to Elizabeth Groves, the Manager over at 5427 Carlton Way in Los Angeles.. She's a class act. I'm a Vendor for a few Beach Front Properties. & having someone as good & on top of all things to do with the complex is really great. If i ever have any questions or concerns. She's beyond helpful & always easy to get in touch with. She's also always very friendly, if i ever run into her while I'm working at the property. She's a total professional 👍<//text>

I have lived at the Arlington Gardens for many years but the last three have been the best with our manager Robert. He really cares about our property and is always there for us for what ever our needs are he is there at all hours of the day if needed.  His dedication to his residents and his job is second to none. Our home is a better place because of him. With the new construction he is always on top of things and is always there to answer any questions. Thank you Robert< /review>

Angelica who is the new property manager here at my apt which I moved in a month ago is so professional, respectful and straight forward..  she's a woman of her word, she makes sure every unit is up to par before renting, I always see her involved with the maintenance workers outside.. she also keeps the outside clean  herself as well as the laundry room... She responds to inquires in a timely matter, and gets the job done immediately. .. thankful that I ran into her...   Since she is hired Under beach front properties, that means beach front properties is doing an amazing job with their management hiring and also responding to her in a timely matter as well!

<text>Marlo, the property manager has been nothing but nice since I met her. She has great customer service. She's prompt when responding to inquiries or requests I've had. She made moving into the property quick and easy.

The property itself is very clean and quiet. I'd recommend this company to others.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1545321058575, 'text': 'Raven,\n\nThank you so much for your kind review.

This review is for Chelsea Lewis. I have nothing but positive things to say about Chelsea since she’s come on board as my property manager for the house I rent as well as the apartment complex next door.  She’s super friendly, very responsive in texting and taking care of business on the property’s. She communicates clearly with me & the maintenance workers when they are coming to take care of issues. I’ve never had any problems getting a hold of her. She’s on top of her job that’s for sure.  Keep up the great work :)<//review>

The worst property management I've ever rented from. I've had for different point of contacts in five months. My previous poc were all "Temps". The receptionist is in the phone every single time I come in. Initially didn't give me a mailbox key, that took two months. Then it was changed without telling me because I share with someone, want told that either, and they gave me a key! After six months I still don't have a trash can. Call and leave messages to speak with someone and never hear back. Parking is terrible, but it's long Beach. Something is up with this place, there is no way they are this terrible at managing properties. Will never rent from again!<//Review>

I have been a tenant for more than six years with the Beach Front Property Management company at different buildings. I recently moved to Marine Bay Apartments, and I am glad I did. Marlo is a professional and friendly manager. She responds to my questions in a timely matter; I love the fact that I can text her. The building is always clean and quiet. Great job Marlo!!< /Review>

He’s been at the Knobhill Apartments in Redondo Beach managed by Ashley for almost a year now. Ashley has been a great manager this far. She’s easy to get a hold of, a great communicator and gets on the issue at hand right away. When we first looked at the apartment, she met us twice in the same day without any problem. The building has been going thru intensive renovations and she’s tried her best to make it as painless as possible for all involved. The apartment itself has some issues at first and she didn’t rest or avoid us until every last thing was handled. Julio loves living there and I love to visit!!!<//Review>< Pics>

After living here for approximately 2 years,  one of the best things I appreciated about living here was the management. Always timely and always extremely helpful. Ana was always very considerate and understanding with everything from setting up a maintenance appointment to a simple question about the apartment. While I did leave for something a little better suited for our family, I very mich enjoyed my stay on the citrus property.< /review>

Chelsea (my on site building manager) is great! Plumbing issues handled quickly and other non emergency maintenance scheduled and followed up on in a timely manner. I've had bad luck with some of the building managers in the past, with them not really interested in getting anything fixed or quality of living but Chelsea is different. Definitely reccomend her.<//Review>

<Text>This company is all about money, They don’t care about you they don’t care about the apartment all they care about is raising the rent much as they can.

This will be my second time around were beachfront properties buys out the existing owner, only to result with ridiculous rent increases pretty much forcing people to move out!

I live in a small one bedroom one bath + garage. And in the past two years rent has gone up almost $250...while no improvements have been done to my unit within the last 5 years. (I knew the previous renter)

When you try to contact them about the unfair rent increase they just ignore you.

Just giving fellow renters out there a heads up.<//Text>< user>

Chelsea from BFPM ROCKS!! Whenever I need assistance with any maintenance emergencies, she is always on top of it. I receive quick responses, she communicates throughout the process and she ensures the problem is taken care of immediately.

Chelsea is also knowledgeable and very helpful. She cares about her tenants, the appearance of our building and she goes above and beyond...

Thank you Chelsea! You are by far the best property manager.<//text>

While looking for an apartment for our family. We came across the property in the city of Paramount. The Manager was very helpful and patient in finding us the right apartment. Angelica has been so helpful and attentive since day one and made sure our unit was complete and updated for us to move in. She made sure our move went smooth and that we were taken care of. She maintains the property and amenities clean and in order. Her services as a manager at this property has been excellent. Beach Front  Property Management has acquired an outstanding employee.<//text>

Chelsea our apartment manager has been great since she took over our building in San Pedro. Living here has been awesome and she’s taken care of any problems I’ve had so far. Hopefully beachfront keeps her around for a long time.<//Text>

First let me start off by saying I moved to my apartment in San Pedro 7 months ago once I Moved in I was a little worried because I didn’t hear great things about the previous non-Lord but of course I didn’t base my move on that. So I’ve been here and Chelsea was the new landlord first let me just start off by saying I’ve had a few landlords and by far Chelsea has been amazing. I’ve had a few plumbing problems no matter what time of the day it is she always responds to me and always gets the problem fixed as soon as possible. The washer and dryers at my building we’re kind of old and I told her about the problem and she assured me that she would talk it over with her boss and we had new washer and dryer’s within weeks and to me that’s amazing.
No matter what the issues are she always make sure to respond to me and if it needs to be fixed it’s always fix that day. Thank you Chelsea for being such a great landlord keep up the good work .<//Review>

Veronica Pulido recently took over this property at 14119 Mulberry Dr in Whittier Ca. It was a shocker, I think for every one here. But it has also being the best and blessing thing. Shes very nice and professional. Takes the time to listen to our needs and shes very humble person. The maintance man Jeremiah is very nice and good worker. She's the best manager we have ever had. Thank you Veronica  for being a simple and humble human being.<//review>

<name>Ernest Li< /name><review>I had a wonderful stay in Oceanside thanks to Beach Front. Our unit was nicely furnished, super clean, and really spacious.

The hot tub in the patio area was the highlight for me. After a long drive, it was so nice to be able to relax with an amazing view of the ocean.

I will definitely use Beach Front again for my next stay in Oceanside!< /review>< gmapID>

< Review>
I have been living at a property managed by them near downtown Long Beach for years, and they have very little regard for our safety, with an ongoing problem of people breaking into cars and trespassing into the parking lot. Several of the tenants have brought up the issue to them with no resolve. We have asked several times for a lock to be installed in the back gate, which they put but never  lock  back throughout the week after they leave it open for trash day. We also requested a new front gate lock since an old tenant still has the key and constantly comes into the parking lot to use as a place to smoke in, bringing other people in with him. Our cars have been keyed, broken into, and stolen from. The only solution they give us is to call the cops (which we do and have several police reports regarding these issues already) resulting in no help whatsoever. They lack management skills never being available when we call getting a call back days later. The laundry room is also another big issue with the machines always braking down with the same issues resulting in damage to our clothing, they say they fix it bandaging up the problem until it brakes down again in a few weeks. Our rent has been raised several times with no improvements being done for the building. The only reason we are still here is because we can’t afford to move away at the moment, but as soon as we can we are definitely going back to Ernst & Haas which provided great service in the last property we resided in. I had previously reviewed this place better after having a great call from the main office saying they would help with our issues, but he didn’t fix anything at all and I later got ignored after inquiring what they were going to do to resolve our issues. If I could give them less than one star I would.<//Review>

It’s coming up on my 1 year anniversary with Beach Front and I’m more than happy with my experience so far. Any time we come across problems, Marlo has been quick to respond and has made sure the problem was resolved. At our old place, the managers would come up with their own “fixes” to save money, but those never worked. No cheap fixes here at Beach Front! Thank goodness. My husband and I are happy and comfortable where we are and are thankful to have such attentive staff!< /Text>

I'm coming up on a full year at my place on Carnegie Lane in Redondo Beach and all I can say is...I love this place! The neighbors are awesome. The ocation is terrific and the unit itself is Tip-Top. From the backsplash in the kitchen to the paint color on the walls, it's like it was designed for my own style. And my experience w/BFPM has been stellar. I moved from a place where I never saw a representative from the management company...for 5 years! I won't even get into the goings-on in that building w/24 units.
I have to say, too, that I am super appreciative of Marlo. She really helped me out when I needed it. My intent was to rent at another BFPM property, but someone beat me to the punch w/the deposit. I wanted to stay in the South Bay, and Marlo came through w/the spot at Carnegie Lane. They say things happen for a reason and I am so grateful that I ended up here. Couldn't be happier. Thank you Marlo, and thank you BFPM! A-plus!</Text>

<Review>I have lived at the Barbara and Irene apartments in Long Beach for about 3 years now. The neighbors are very friendly and respectful. Michael our manager at the complex was extraordinary in helping me move in. What I truly appreciate about Michael is he is always genuinely caring about all the tenants. If there are ever any issues, Michael is quick to respond and resolve the problems. Thank you Michael for all your effort and time. It was a wonderful experience living at the Barbara and Irene apartments, I would recommend anyone moving into the Long Beach area to contact Beach Front Property Mangement to see if they have anything available. At this time unfortunately I have to move out, but my stay here has been pleasant.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

As a tenant for over 3 years, our experience with Beach Front Property Management has been excellent. Their corporate team is great and the actual property managers that we have had in the past few years have all been great. Out current manager, Michelle, is always on top of the property's needs as well as the tenants. Thank you Michelle for all your support and in maintaining The Web Apartments a proud place we call our home.</text>

<Review>We’ve had a few maintenance repairs and after requesting to have someone sent to us, we have had a Milton Batres’s come to us the first two times (after that, it’s been by request) as he is there on time, is very professional and cares about delivery quality. He won’t leave until you are satisfied with his work, and that’s not easy with someone as particular as I am. Thank you for always being so patient and going out of your way to help us!< /Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Been living at the 922 Cedar property now for nearly 2 years. Our Manager Mike McMahon has been a tremendous help to ensure our tenancy has been a healthy one. Work orders are done efficiently,  he personally makes sure our requests are handled effectively. The property remains clean.
The camaraderie he provides makes our stay pleasant and we are grateful that Beach Front has him as our manager.< /review>

<Review>I just moved in to the 13922 Arthur Ave. In paramount, CA apartments and I must say "best experience ever"! The manager by the name of Angelica has been very awesome, professional and friendly. She was very thorough and explained everything (I.E rules and lease contract) to the "T". She also made the whole leasing process fast and easy. Thanks to Angelica for everything.</Review>< pictures>

<review>There is an overcharge for paying rent with checks. I handed the receptionist a check for the rent and a second check with the overcharge of twenty five dollars inside an envelope with our address. She lost the second check and called my husband to tell him that we owe twenty five dollars!!!!!! For her ineptitude my  checking account could be compromised if that check falls into the wrong hands. I would not be paying rent with a check if that receptionist had given me the correct code to pay online in the first place.<//review>< Pictures>

I've been living at the Citrus Apartments, and a large majority of this time Ana has been the manager. Not only is she incredibly friendly, shes very professional. Any time I've had a request, or even just a question, she is very prompt in replying. I am comfortable and content knowing she is the one I need to go to in order to resolve any issue.</Text>

Not sure if Celene at 1305 w 19th will see this but wow!!!! She’s such a great person. I was in the market for a new apartment and she was so nice and professional with all the questions I had. Although I ended grabbing an apartment somewhere else, I wish I could take her to be the apartment manager at this place!!! 5 stars forsure towards professionalism and kindness< /text>

The absolute worst management I’ve ever dealt with. There is ZERO care or concern of the tenants unless the rent money does not show up. I submitted 5 separate requests to have my heater fixed after it broke AGAIN for the THIRD time. Only to be given the run around. I could LITERALLY hear the employee on the phone and in the background laughing as I asked to speak to a manager onsite. At one point someone said “You tell him girl”. That is not professionalism or how you treat people.

Save yourself the headache and nightmare now! Stay far far away from these people!<//review>

<Date>1562020076285< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>I have been living in a building managed by this company for more almost two decades. The building was well taken care of, full of lush green, happy tenants, and a very attentive manager. Since BPM has taken over - everything has changed. Neighbors have had holes of 2'x2' in their walls for years, walls are crumbling, dirt keeps piling up and the roaches are in heaven. In my case, needed requested repairs and replacements  have not been started in some cases in a period of 106 weeks and counting. One is constantly referred to someone else 'in charge'. Emails, phone calls, Text messages etc. remain unanswered. So far I have spoken to roughly 10 people at the company over a period of more than 3 years without any solution to the issues in my apartment. walls, doorframes and flooring is collapsing, paint coming off the walls in sheets etc.
Neighbors paying $2000+ in rent, have to live without stoves for months, laundry machines are broken for weeks at a time and the basement keeps flooding on a monthly basis. It appears that legal action from all tenants living in BFP managed buildings will be the only resolution to making this company take on responsibility...

In response to the owner...

I want to say that Angelica at Downey Pointe is an amazing manager. If I could give her 10-Stars I would. Thank you for always returning my calls. I know I get annoying sometimes, but you always respond. So hopefully this review will help you as much as you have helped our family and we thank you!<//review>

<review>I'm currently a tenant at 13822Arthur Ave in Paramount. Before Angelica took over the building was a HOT mess. Now it's so quiet, Clean and very enjoyable to live in. Whenever I need anything or I have a question she doesn't hesitant to help you. She is very  friendly  but yet very professional. Always with a smile on her face. I would totally recommend this building if you are currently looking for a new place to call home!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Been living at the 922 Cedar property now for nearly 2 years. Our Manager Mike McMahon has been a tremendous help to ensure our tenancy has been a healthy one. Work orders are done efficiently,  he personally makes sure our requests are handled effectively. The property remains clean.
The camaraderie he provides makes our stay pleasant and we are grateful that Beach Front has him as our manager.< /review>

< review>
I lived over at the apartments on Marine in Gardena and it was by far my favorite living experience. I moved to start a family a couple years ago but I still get nostalgic when I drive by. The property was well maintained, calm and had overall great energy. My favorite part about it though was Marlo, the building manager. She is the sweetest most approachable woman. I am very much a no BS type of person, respect is huge for me and with Marlo it's the same way. She will greet you with a warmest smile everytime yet at the same time I could trust her to be disciplined enough to protect the property from distasteful people / bad company. She is a great judge of character and because of that I never felt unsafe living there. I was a single 22 year old girl living by myself there with a cat, so that feeling of protection was everything for me.
I am always recommending my friends and family to live at this building.< /review>

When we moved into our place we had a ton of issues with our unit because of the contractor doing a botched, horrible job. This was also under the terrible management of IKEA. After IKEA and the contractor were both fired, we received the best answered prayers in the form of management with Joulene who always follows up and has turned this entire property around in such a short period and Renes who always comes through and does a fantastic job with repairing any and all things within our apartment. Renes and Joulene are both extremely thorough and they never leave anything undone. I have stayed in a lot of different apartments in different cities and Joulene and Renes are the absolute best! They are simply second to none. I am happy to stay with BF as long as they are on the team. God bless both of them!!!</Text>< pictures>

I moved here from Oklahoma had a wrongful eviction on my report. Letter from management company but still had problems. A mutual friend gave me the information.  1st. Clue they work with evictions. Most landlords that do are slum Lord's.  I was receiving government help because I informed the agency that was helping not to pay because I could not get them to fix anything and when I moved in there was dog feces in the living room carpet smelled horrible.  Needless to say the manager Daniel got upset filed an eviction. It was worked out with the Attorney that since I had been out of town due to a death and could not be properly served less known answer they would drop it. I go to rent two weeks ago and there they are reporting an eviction.  Never deal with these people.< /Text>

Great remodeled apartments with wood floors, AC and dishwasher. Love that there is a common area with grillers that anyone can use.

Manager onsite is very nice and responsive to any  issues.

My wife and I have never had any issues with the neighbors and our experience there has truly been wonderful. Very much recommend this location if you want to be close to all the supermarkets and shopping mall.

Managers name is Luz.

Quality of life goes down to a 2/10 when you choose beachfront property management. You will deal with issues you never thought possible.

Edit: the LA Times just wrote an article on “SoCal Cities Lead the U.S. in Inflation - And Housing Costs Are a Major Reason why” and the cover photo features, oddly enough, one of the Beachfront Property Management apartments. They are the epitome of cheap quality and inflated prices.

Edit: edited review due to management reaching out in an attempt to fix the issue. I’m relieved to know that upper management has a better work ethic than the employees I’ve dealt with thus far.

Edit 8-23-19: Management hasn't followed through with their attempts to resolve the situation, and I haven't heard anything beyond their initial response to my review. Which is quite unfortunate since I've lost a few valuable things already to their maintenance crew "cleaning up" the storage underneath the staircase. Where all my stuff went? I have no idea. And today I just found out that maintenance and specifically the property manager went through everyone's apartments to do "check ups". Why wasn't I officially notified that strangers were going to rummage through my belongings while I was gone on vacation? I am lucky I had someone watch my place for me, or who knows, MORE of my stuff could've gone missing. Sheesh.

Edit 11-7-19: There was an attempted break-in last night in one of my neighbor’s units. Upon contacting property management, their only response was “I’m so sorry.”

ATTENTION to any families looking to move into the Cedar Ave property - the next door property is heavily gang affiliated, there’s been several stabbings and shootings that I’ve personally witnessed in front of the property, I’ve seen fist fights happen over parking spots, and I’ve even witnessed an attempted abduction. None of this was ever mentioned to me before I rented the unit. In fact, one of the things Lindsay Stokes advertised (on video) about my unit was that “everything” was remodeled, even the plumbing. So far, nearly every unit has had plumbing issues on numerous occasions. Not slight problems either - I’m talking full-on sewage flooding.

Beachfront needs to drop this property ASAP unless they want to continue soiling their reputation. Word of mouth goes far.< /Text>

We called the main office since our manager is currently away. I kid you not, Cesar made it to our complex and had our door open for us within 20 minutes!!!

<username>Andrew Kowal</username><Date>1538868027647</Date><Review>I would like to take the opportunity to thank Robert from Beach Front Property Management for his exceptional care of the property I am renting in Redondo Beach. I am renting a large 1 bedroom apartment in a 4 unit complex. I was so impressed with the initial process of accepting me as a new tenant in late March of 2018. I was in the process of relocation due to airport expansion on Aviation Blvd and had been contacting several management companies and had no success in contacting anyone, just the a voicemail recording. When I saw the for rent sign for my current apartment ,thanks to Robert the process of selecting me was very efficient. I was given the key to my new place in less than 48 hours! For the future tenant I would highly recommend this management company and especially Robert.

I have been a resident of 2816 W 182nd Street for more than 5 years until now and I never had bad experience with the management.  Our current manager Michelle is so helpful, accommodating and approachable.  Everytime I request for maintenance she always make sure that my request will be acted upon immediately.  Thank you Michelle!</review>

<Review>Great remodeled apartments with wood floors, AC and dishwasher. Love that there is a common area with grillers that anyone can use.

Manager onsite is very nice and responsive to any  issues.

My wife and I have never had any issues with the neighbors and our experience there has truly been wonderful. Very much recommend this location if you want to be close to all the supermarkets and shopping mall.

Managers name is Luz.

Cesar Morales is a life saver! My family which includes 3 small children were locked out of our unit today and to make matters worse, it is during a HEAT WAVE... We called the main office since our manager is currently away. I kid you not, Cesar made it to our complex and had our door open for us within 20 minutes!!! Thank you so so much Cesar, you are greatly appreciated.<//Review>

< Review>
Quality of life goes down to a 2/10 when you choose beachfront property management. You will deal with issues you never thought possible.

Edit: the LA Times just wrote an article on “SoCal Cities Lead the U.S. in Inflation - And Housing Costs Are a Major Reason why” and the cover photo features, oddly enough, one of the Beachfront Property Management apartments. They are the epitome of cheap quality and inflated prices.

Edit: edited review due to management reaching out in an attempt to fix the issue. I’m relieved to know that upper management has a better work ethic than the employees I’ve dealt with thus far.

Edit 8-23-19: Management hasn't followed through with their attempts to resolve the situation, and I haven't heard anything beyond their initial response to my review. Which is quite unfortunate since I've lost a few valuable things already to their maintenance crew "cleaning up" the storage underneath the staircase. Where all my stuff went? I have no idea. And today I just found out that maintenance and specifically the property manager went through everyone's apartments to do "check ups". Why wasn't I officially notified that strangers were going to rummage through my belongings while I was gone on vacation? I am lucky I had someone watch my place for me, or who knows, MORE of my stuff could've gone missing. Sheesh.

Edit 11-7-19: There was an attempted break-in last night in one of my neighbor’s units. Upon contacting property management, their only response was “I’m so sorry.”

ATTENTION to any families looking to move into the Cedar Ave property - the next door property is heavily gang affiliated, there’s been several stabbings and shootings that I’ve personally witnessed in front of the property, I’ve seen fist fights happen over parking spots, and I’ve even witnessed an attempted abduction. None of this was ever mentioned to me before I rented the unit. In fact, one of the things Lindsay Stokes advertised (on video) about my unit was that “everything” was remodeled, even the plumbing. So far, nearly every unit has had plumbing issues on numerous occasions. Not slight problems either - I’m talking full-on sewage flooding.

Beachfront needs to drop this property ASAP unless they want to continue soiling their reputation. Word of mouth goes far.<//Review>

<gmap_id>0x80dd3390a16b70a9:0x341b585bd4aca995</gmap_id><review>I’ve been renting for almost a year and have a current issue which I have addressed with my building manager Elizabeth at Carlton Way. I had been out of town a few weeks and when I returned home I found that my bathroom had a sewage flood and there was mold growing in my bathroom and hallway and laundry area. I have now been home over a week and the only person trying to help me is my building manager who has taken all of my concerns and photos to her supervisors. It seems that no one above her cares that I’ve moved my appliances alone and cleaned up the sewage mess because cleaners weren’t sent for days after I returned... currently I’m still waiting to hear about the floor replacement. I haven’t  been able to laundry at home in a week as my washing machine is currently in my bedroom because it cant go back in it’s spot because of the flooring. My time is valuable to me as I’m sure everyone’s is and I will be traveling again in a few days.
So I’m giving 5 starts to Elizabeth and negative stars to the property management company because of the lack of timely response and the fact that I’m in week two with mold growing in the floor.
*******************************************************
Issues continued and then I was  pre-charged before my move out date for painting which no one had even looked at yet. How shady is that?!  Then I was not returned my money for over a month and absolutely no resolve over the paint charge, broken washer, pipe leaking on my car, a/c leaking on my brand new bed... This company is trash< /review>< Response>

Management at the Raymond Court Apartments has declined. I was so looking forward to positive change from the new landlord. I'm very disappointed with the new hire. A positive outlook turned into a negative one. Landlord has very poor communication and  gives preferential treatment to other tenants. Please talk to the manager at the complex to see if he is able to handle being the landlord. Per the manager he has reported to numerous tenants that he is "burnt out" and "stressed out" from his other job and can seem to handle the his task at the apartment complex.</Text>

<Review>Our new Manager at Downey Pointe,  Angie Martinez, has done more to straighten out this building in 2 months than in all the years of the previous  manager. WOW!! 180° turnaround. Responsive, effective, sweet and courteous. The parking issues are resolved, building is clean, feel safe with new cameras and it feels good to come home knowing improvements are going on.. Great Place to live and great Management! Thank you Ms Angie!<//Review>< pics>

I was a tenant at Country Club Apartments in Downey and my manager Christina was the best manager I've ever had. She always was quick to take care of any problems in my apartment and she was always so friendly and caring. My manager now sucks and am seriously thinking of going back to Country Club. Other managers just don't seem to care.</text>

< Review>
I've lived at the property in San Pedro Point Fermin for about 5 years during this time there have been a few managers some bad some not as bad. The place not always been the cleanest and no pride taken in the upkeep but the rent is relatively inexpensive for the area. Then we got a new manager Chelsea since her arrival new carpet installed!replacing the old worn out and stained nasty carpet interior of the building painted and trimed, new flooring on the landings!! She brings a wonderful outlook to the building always accessible and prompt with repairs and always with a great attitude. So glad she's here it's been a long time coming. Also she adds personal touches inspiring quotes on a bulletin board. And Decorations that give the place added charm. Glad Beach Front Property brought her onboard.</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>This is my experience with Beach Front Property Management Inc and their tactics of tenants harassment and violation of civil rights. My building is being bought out and we were offered cash for keys, but refused and decided to stay until we find a better place, but Last Sunday the building manager who represents Beach Front Property Management Inc delayed urgent medical assistance intentionally and contributed to the deterioration of my mother's health. We were taking my mother to the ER, but the building manager blocked us in. She parked her car sideways and blocked the only way out to the streets. Tenants of the building witnessed how The building manager and her negligence harmed the health of my mother who needed urgent care, but was blocked in intentionally and maliciously. When asked repeatedly to move her car out of the way she refused and said to call 911 or get out on foot. The police and paramedics arrived 35 minutes after continuous calls from me and building tenants who were upset and had come out to show support. The police arrived before the paramedics and without their intervention my mother could had drop dead in her own building parking lot while our car and exit was being restrained by the building manager. She was finally admitted to the ER for chest pain and high blood pressure and was advised by her cardiologists to stay in the hospital to monitor her condition. She is at full mental, emotional and physical distress and her health condition is not getting any better. She fears for her safety and is in shock after realizing that her civil rights to seek immediate medical assistance were violated and delivery and maliciously delayed by the building manager. The Hospital Emergency is 3.5 minutes away from her address. She did not had to wait for the police to arrive almost 35 minutes after she was on her way to the hospital, but was being blocked in by the building manager intentionally. The building manager was in her car the whole time and walking around, taking pictures and refusing to move out of the way until the police arrived and immediately ordered her to move her car out of the way, so my mother could go to the hospital. My mother is 57 and suffering from a medical chronic condition and is on heavy and delicate
medication to keep her alive and alleviate her chronic pain. She has difficulty walking and moving around. I'm very sad and worried for my mother.</Text>< Pics>

They tried to charge us $1400 of our security deposit for repainting even though it fell under normal wear and tear. When I told them we had pictures, they suddenly changed their tune and offered us the full deposit. It's been weeks without getting the deposit and we are now taking them to small claims court. Avoid the hassle and lease with someone else, these people will do whatever you can to swindle you of your money. The vast majority of these reviews look to be fake and written by the employees of BFPM themselves.<//Review>< rating>

My current manager at Downey Pointe is great. Very friendly and professional. The building is always clean and the office is open everyday now compare to the previous manager! Work requests are done at a time matter and always reply even on her days off! Thank you beach front and  Angelica for a great service.<//review>

<Text>I have move to Gardena two months ago from Santa Monica.   I had to find a place within such a short period and I searched on the internet and I found Marine Bay Apartments.  Marlo, the manager was so kind on the phone when I called for more information.  I called several places for more options, but I found Marine Bay APT was the best option for me.  I had to hurry to move my stuff and Marlo was kind enough to make the process faster.   It was a hectic move, but thanks to her I could make it settle down fast.   It is a very cozy, clean and quiet apartment complex, residents are nice and quiet.  Marlo the manager is always there for us to solve any problem we confront.  Thank you, Marlo!  You are a very sweet lady like a candy!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been living at the 2144 182nd st residence for over a year now and I’ve had a positive experience. The manager, Michelle has always been very accommodating and super helpful in whatever I needed as a tenant. She is quick to respond and makes sure that all my needs are accommodated. It’s a nice quiet residential apartment and my neighbors have all been great. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone who is looking for a nice modern apartment in the torrance area.

Thank you,
Meron< /Text>

I have been living at Downey pointe apartment for 5yrs. We have had different managers thru out my stay here and the best of them all is Ms. Angelica M she is really friendly and professional. Everything I called I get a response from her even if it’s after hours. Out amenities are great here and the best of all it’s that they are always clean.
Parking was an issue but not anymore. Laundry room was always dirty. Now it’s a pleasure to go in the laundry room and wash clothes. Thank you Beach front for hiring a manager like Angelica.</text>

I haven't even rented from these people and they are already giving me hell. Very unprofessional. They do not return calls. They'll say anything to get rid of you and avoid doing their actual job. I turned in an application and somehow it became "lost". Both units I was interested became rented all of a sudden which was very fishy to me as they weren't even supposed to be available for another month and a half. Maria was the only person who helpful and REACHABLE. Angelica and Raquel? Totally different story.<//review>

I’m a 7 year tenant at Downey Pointe and I really have to say that I’m pleased with our new manager Angelica. Since she has been here we have new cameras, upgrades and I feel finally we have someone that not only listens, but make sure that the work get done. Thank you for all your help Angie.</Review>

I've been living at the Web Apartments in Torrance CA for a little over a year and I love this place. It's always clean the grass and plants are kept up and our manager Michelle is the best at resolving any issue no matter the time or problem needed to be fixed.</text>

<review>Really disappointed  in how Michael handle me and my husband really feel like i was completely  discriminated  against. We inquired about the property on cedar text Michael once paper work (app)was filled out he asked if I could come after 7pm the follow day. When time came to turn our info in Michael completely  ignored us we even stood in front of the build to see if he would  acknowledge us He never did he ignored my text and phone call. Sad things is we were judge by the  color of our skin and not the content of our character.</review><rate>1< /rate><Date>1505686534744<//Date><response>None< /response><Name>Chemiya Carter< /Name>< userid>

They do not give ample notice before making repairs and if you ask for more time they take it upon themselves to do whatever they want.  They invaded my privacy and bullied my family to get what they want. I dont feel safe there anymore because it's as if it does not matter what you think - they have the keys they can walk in as they please.  Robert the manager is very sneaky, underhanded and definitely has his own agenda - not a people person at all.  Very, very unsatisfied tenant.  - Arlington Gardens< /text>< pics>

I am very dissatisfied with beach front properties and their manager Marisol. After declining entry to the police, Marisol proceeded to give the keys to the police and granted them access to my home. They say it was for a domestic call but their was no emergency here just a married couple arguing. I had my children home at that time. We are embarrassed to live here and leave our home because people think that we are bad people or criminals.< /review>

(Hawthorne) Management sucks.  Always trying to suck money for everything.
Staff is ignorant.  Now they are trying to charge $5.00 a month for a parking space we have already had for years.  Not to mention the new renter they are bringing in are "GHETTO".  I believe we have  hookers in the building.  People coming and going at all hours.<//Text>

< Review>
We got a new property manager(Chelsea) a few months back and it made such a difference in our building!! If I ever need anything fixed she sends someone right away, something that wasn't being done before.. it's nice to finally have someone who gets it done.  Thank you!<//Review>

They dont mind leaving families, senior citizens, or disabled tenants in the streets. They will evict you, even if you're the best tenant. Managers are only nice when its to their convenience. (Dont be fooled).  New "remodeled" apartments used to be home to families some for over 20 years and they were kicked out,  just for a slight paint job to raise the price for new tenants. If you dont mind renting from a company who leaves families, senior citizens, disabled people homeless, good luck! ( they were NOT evicted for lack of paying rent or bad tenants, they were evicted for no reason other than greed) Apartments are filled with pests and the management is poor. Staff is rude and unprofessional.  Beware of Beach Front Property Management.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

While it is always upsetting when residents are issued notices to vacate, it is almost always so that a new owner can remodel a property.  Unfortunately many of these projects are extensive renovation projects which require new plumbing and replacement of everything inside of the apartments.  98% of the residents asked to move do so easily within the 60 days and we have offered assistance to those who demonstrate a severe financial situation.  Regardless, the team at Beach Front Property Management cares about all of the residents and is hopeful that the money invested in this older housing stock benefits the entire community (construction workers, construction supply stores, neighboring properties and the residents).'}< /Resp>

<Text>I'm a current tenant at Downey Point Apts. I have been living here for 3yrs now. Our previous manager Wendy was a HORRIBLE manager. she was never at the office, building was always dirty, pool was terrible and the worst part she never answer her phone and parking was a nightmare. Things are so much different now. Our new manager Angelica is great always with a smile on her face, friendly, our building is clean, parking is better, cameras were installed. We all feel more secure now. Thank you Beach Front for sending Angelica here because I was about to move out. LOL... If anyone is looking for an apt I totally recommend this building.< /Text>< gmapID>

< review>
We are in one of their properties on Newport Avenue in Long Beach right now and I will be specific about our concerns.  Last year, while we were on vacation, we got a 3 day notice, they had our check but the property manager did not know it (the right hand was not speaking with the left hand).  We had the unique experience of moving in when the owner managed the property and experiencing the change over to Beachfront.  The first thing is the bureaucracy of Beachfront.  Our maintenance requests went from a couple days for a maintenance to two months if you are persistent. While the maintenance person is at your unit, if other items have broken in the interim, and you point them out, he cannot fix them.    You have to submit another maintenance request and wait.  Maintenance items went from same day fixes to multiple day fixes because the maintenance person was missing items or purchased the wrong size replacements.  The maintenance appointment were never in the window provided which interrupts your workday.  From your specific appointment time, they average 90 minutes after the time you are asked to be home by Beachfront.  Finally, I am the landlord of property I manage myself and it is not peaceful because our property management pops up on the property without prior notification all the time.  We pull into our driveway and there is the property manager, Angelica.   This year, I was working at home drafting a legal brief and the property manager came unannounced to the front door, entered and requested to do the annual inspection right in the moment.  No notice, just knocked on the door, and asked it she could come in and take photographs.  Further, in the two years since Beachfront took over, responses times for maintenance have dramatically increased and our rent has dramatically increased each year.   The year the owner turned management over to Beachfront, he increased the rent and it increased each year of Beachfront's management.  We just wanted to live in Belmont Heights near the water but we give up.  For the amount of the rent, it is not worth the hassle.  Also, we cc'd the corporate office on all of our requests to our designated property manager which prompted repeated scoldings from our property manager Angelica because she said it made her look bad.< /review>

I passed by a sign on Quartz Lane and called. Laura the property manager showed me the apartment, 3105 Quartz Lane (Fullerton),  but did not show much interest. She got a call from another party and gave them an appointment in 5 minutes. I still had questions and wanted to tell her my situation being a student and all, but she was in no mood to listen. She said the other party will be coming, so gave me the application, asked me to fill it in and put in the mail box in front of her apartment across the street, got us out the door and locked it. I went looking for her apartment mail box and meantime discovered she was talking on her cell phone and actively looking for the other party, then found them walking down from across the street. Felt like I have been slapped in the face and thrown out on the street. :-(<//Text>

I would have put zero stars if possible. It took over a year for repair of my restroom. Then when they finally started left it halfway done and another 2 months went by for maintenance to come back and finished.< /Review>

I strongly recommend that if you do not want a bad experience renting, do not rent from them. We lived at a unit they managed (4th and St Andrews)  in Koreatown LA for 5 years and they just don't care about you. They tell you they will call you back but they never do. We had a huge hole in our ceiling leaking water that spiders also started to drop from in our bathroom from the unit above that we couldn't get them to fix until a month and a half later. We had contacted them multiple times about but they just didn't care. we also were charged on our gas bill because of earthquake emergency valve shut off that we did not call in, it took three months of haggling with them, and once they finally figured out it wasnt us they said would refund us and send us a check. That never happened. They never took care of it and we had to pay a extra $75 out of our pocket just so our credit wasnt bad. The gated garage was broken for months and that was our last straw when our car got broken into because of that. When we scheduled a walk through prior to leaving, they never showed up and would not answer our calls. We waited 2 hours for a response and didnt get one. we had to leave because our lease we got for our new place was in another state. after we started driving for an hour we got a call back from the onsite manager who came up with a lie about saying we were suppose to call when we were ready for him to check (that was a lie we literally set up a scheduled time for him to be there) then he said he would facetime us the next morning and do a walk through with us that way. when he called we missed the call by two minutes and called him IMEDIATELY (Now he never said what time he was going to call in the morning so we didnt know when) HE IGNORED ALL OUR CALLS. They truly do not care about there residents and are not trustworthy, we didnt not feel safe and will never rent from that company again.< /Text>

My building have been managed by BFPM for the past few years, I can say I've have NOT experienced any issues with various managers. Maria, my current off site manager have  always handled my calls and texts speedy and very professionally, front lost rent, ,building vandalism , illegal parking and any repair issues inside my unit. I normally pay my rent in person and I can say the receptionist welcomes me monthly with a warm smile and friendly greeting. I would highly recommend BFPM< /review>

<Text>Worst management company ever. New neighbors sell drugs. We've lived here for 6 years and not been late Ever on rent. Because of Veronica De LaCruz who was employed by Beachfront took her clothes off in my room to change. Yes I was shocked. Called her boss Steve Savage the Biggest liar of this Co. He did nothing. We've been cussed out by other tenants. Nothing gets done. Chelsea took over and Sorry but she's right along with Steve no return phone calls. Got everyone in our unit to sign against us. Been trying to get corporate office and nobody will give me there number. Now we got a notice that they want us out . I m not running. I'm suing. I've had to see a doctor and this had been Very upsetting to my minor son< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I strongly recommend that if you do not want a bad experience renting, do not rent from them. We lived at a unit they managed (4th and St Andrews)  in Koreatown LA for 5 years and they just don't care about you. They tell you they will call you back but they never do. We had a huge hole in our ceiling leaking water that spiders also started to drop from in our bathroom from the unit above that we couldn't get them to fix until a month and a half later. We had contacted them multiple times about but they just didn't care. we also were charged on our gas bill because of earthquake emergency valve shut off that we did not call in, it took three months of haggling with them, and once they finally figured out it wasnt us they said would refund us and send us a check. That never happened. They never took care of it and we had to pay a extra $75 out of our pocket just so our credit wasnt bad. The gated garage was broken for months and that was our last straw when our car got broken into because of that. When we scheduled a walk through prior to leaving, they never showed up and would not answer our calls. We waited 2 hours for a response and didnt get one. we had to leave because our lease we got for our new place was in another state. after we started driving for an hour we got a call back from the onsite manager who came up with a lie about saying we were suppose to call when we were ready for him to check (that was a lie we literally set up a scheduled time for him to be there) then he said he would facetime us the next morning and do a walk through with us that way. when he called we missed the call by two minutes and called him IMEDIATELY (Now he never said what time he was going to call in the morning so we didnt know when) HE IGNORED ALL OUR CALLS. They truly do not care about there residents and are not trustworthy, we didnt not feel safe and will never rent from that company again.< /review>< Rating>

<review>Since i lived in the gardena complex pets were never allowed. I was never made aware that pets are now allowed in the apartment complex.  One of my neighbors has small dog in the buliding and it's barking is very annoying. I would not have mind if i would have gotten a written letter by beach front that states that pets were now allowed in the building.This is very poor communicatiom on beach fronts end. Thanks for the update that i never got on having pets in the complex.  Im all for pets but im complaining because i never got a written letter. Again poor communication. I agree with most of the post on here about poor communication from beach front managment. It suck! Fyi this is not the only pet in the building. It would have been nice to know that we are allowed pets in the building.

7/30/18
So....im still hearing the dog barking and have not gotten any type of response from beach front. So what is it? Are we able to have pets? Yes or no? Or is beach front incapable of communicating properly with its tenants.
Thanks</review>< Pics>

< Review>
I have been a tenant at BFP for about 12 years and moved out into a rental house. Never had a issue with the Manager or any issue with maintenance. Now I wish I never moved out of there in the first place. I know Raquel was telling me don't do it but I did. I just wish there was some units available around Orange County. There good in contacting me by email, if there was. Thank you Raquel at BFP for everything.</Review>

<Review>To whom it may concern my mom and i came to fill out  a credit check application at the same time  she had gave the manager Letty   $500 dollars deposit for a unit that's in 24818 eshelman. Ave.  Lomita ca. 90717. Which that time that unit was still occupied  until three weeks later the previous renters were going to move out.  Letty 2 days later got a hold of my mom and told her that  everything was good on the application that she would let my mom know when will the apartment be ready.  My mom had gone to the doctors the next day and she was told that her health was not good she needed to stop working and concentrate on her health and see the doctor more frequently  for treatment.So my mom decided to move out of L.A  to focus on her health and get treatment.  She called Letty and told her she no longer wanted the apartment the next day after she was accepted for the unit Letty said ok I'll call you back regarding the deposit . She never called my mom back or answer  her calls at all. But when i called  her she did answer me and she  told that deposit was gone she not getting back in a rude heartless attitude with no remorse for my mom at all that's $500 dollars of her hard earn money. My mom talked to Diane at Beach Front Properties  all she said she needed tex message or email as proof. When my mom told her she spoke with Letty from 24818 eshelman. Ave.  Lomita ca. 90717 over the phone verbally.  So its  June already and no response at all. Its unfair to my mom to experience this with Beach Front properties  its very unprofessional.  Mean  while i will be looking legal advice to investigate maybe theres more people out there that the same thing happened to them.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dd3390a16b70a9:0x341b585bd4aca995< /GmapID>< user>

Unfair treatment By bfpm<//username>
<text>Very disappointed in Beach Front Property Management and the managment approach at the15205 building in Gardena. Bfpm just gave me and all the tenants another rent increase. The last rent increase was 9 months ago. Bfpm what is going on? It has not even been a year and your raising rent? If your going to raise rent please make sure to make those needed upgrades and repairs in the apartments like you had stated when you came for your site visit last year. Bfpm has decided to take control over the buildings parking area and has elimated the extra parking spaces for tenants. Parking was never an issue until bfpm hired the onsite manager Rudy Washington who made a mess of the whole parking assigments. Now since the tenants are limited to parking, tenants now have to find street parking which by the way is a nightmare to find street parking. Not only is it a nighmare finding parking, but it is a major  inconvenience for tenants who have been living at the building for 15 plus years. By the way bfpm made sure that the onsite manager gets 3 parking spaces that took away from the tenants parking. Are the owners of the building aware about whole parking take over and the sudden rent increase? Bfpm Why are you trying to tow away a tenants car that is parked in their designated parking area? That is complete harassment. The car that is parked in its desginated area does not run, but is not taking parking away from any other tenants. Lets see what the fair housing rights has to say about that.  Bfpm come talk to the tenants regarding this issue and other concerns that need to be addressed.

6/14/18
What are these so called common areas? Because you changed a door knob thats suppose make the rent increase. Yeah i understand the carpet change, but what about the flooring in the kitchen? How did some apartments get that changed and some didn't. More special treatment to specific tenants? Bfpm should of made improvements to all apartments not only specific ones. Your quick to modify the empty ones , but forget about the current tenants. By the way the so called "firelane" bfpm created is not a city issue. Its some bogus BS excuse to get rid of parking. The city of gardena stated that it is a property managment decision ,So bfpm is not getting fined for anything thats been made up by them. That means you can still park in the so called "firelane" space. Call the city and find out bfpm is full of it. Bfpm may say that manager has two spaces, but manager is still using 3 spaces. Manager has a total of 3 cars. Manager is here policing tenants cars in the back threating to tow away cars. So who is policing managers car if being parked in unauthorized parking spaces? You need to tow managers car as well if managers parking where he is not suppose to. Very poor comunication between onsite manager and bfpm. Manager is not even aware of what bfpm has been telling tenants. When tenants try to communicate with manager and relay information that was  given to them by bfpm to tenants manager is left clueless. Bfpm isnt even returning tenant calls anymore. Bfpm tells tenants one thing and tells the manager another thing. I will be leaving this place very soon. Btw  who ever responded to my last review did not leave a name or call back number that really shows the total lack of professionalism that bfpm carries. None!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

<Resp>{'time': 1528997571562, 'text': "This issue is completely misunderstood. At that property yes there were rent increases, along with every unit getting new carpet, common area upgrades, several units have had refinishes since the take over.\n\nAccording to parking. There is 32 units in the building 4-2 bedrooms and 28-1 bedrooms.  There is just enough parking in the building for each 1-Bedroom to have one covered parking spot with storage and the 2-bedrooms to have 2 parking spots (1 cover & 1 uncovered).  There is no extra parking in that building. People were parking in the fire lanes and in areas that are not permitted by the city. The previous management did not have a list of assigned parking and people were parking everywhere disregarding the fire lanes and up against the fence. On this street, there are several apartment buildings and street parking is a must. There is not enough parking spaces to provide 2 parking spaces per unit. so yes street parking is the only option if you have multiple cars.\n\nIn regards to the manager getting 3 parking spots. Rudy is the only one in the building who does not have a covered parking spot. He has two spaces.  And then we have a space for maintenance, emergency services and deliveries. With 32 units and 36 spaces we cannot provide 2 spaces per unit.  so in order to be 100% fair unlike previous management company.  We have to allocate the parking according to the units. Which was designed that way before we took over.\n\nWe made the right decision based on 100% transparency and fairness of all units.\n\nThanks,\n\nIn response, to latest. The number is listed on here and I have not received a call from you because you left an anonymous name. However, there is not enough parking for the entire building to have two spaces.  It's the landscaping of the building. And yes that area on the side of the building up against the fence is not a parking spot and does not have enough room to fit the entire building without it being unfair to someone else.

<Review>This review is going to the property management as a request to request your tenants in apartment building at 3022 15th street, Long Beach to please pick up their dog crap when they walk them out. Having a dog in an apartment building still seems selfish to me but more so when their lazy owners don't pick up after their dogs and consequently worsen the flies problem specially in the summer. I have personally observed them to be the culprits and I would appreciate it if you request that they pick up after their dogs.</Review>< username>

<review>This property management company is horrible. My car has been vandalized TWICE while living at 12405 Benedict ave Downey 90242.

The managers onsite have access to the tapes and refuses to review or lie and say its already been deleted. I have requested that they preserve the tape for litigation and my insurance purposes and they still refused.

This is disturbing that I am a tenant that doesn't have issues with anyone yet my car is constantly vandalized in a secure locked gate so clearly its the tenants here.

Unsure who they are protecting at this point. Maybe its the property managers themselves. They only rent to Hispanics and there are very few African american families that currently live here now.<//review><name>Jay Jay< /name><Gmap_id>0x80dd3390a16b70a9:0x341b585bd4aca995< /Gmap_id><Rating>1< /Rating>< response>

Very unprofessional property management company. They are definitely a part of what’s wrong with OC not having rental control & gentrification! I first rented from them years ago only to have them kick out all tenants (small unit complex) to “remodel” and change to senior living. The apartment I moved to was previously better managed, until about a year ago this joke of a company bought them out. Since then this over 80 unit complex has gone from being completed rented out to running out most tenants (who on average have been living here 10+ years). They claim to be asking tenants to leave giving only 2 months to vacate so they can “remodel” and ridiculously raise up the price about $300 more. The “renovations” are just pulling out outdated carpet and replacing it with ugly gray laminate flooring, slapping some paint, & changing out the outdated stoves. This rental company is AWFUL!!!!<//text>

Units are infested with large Roaches and ants
They don't come fix the units  I asked 3 times  and up to this date still no fix.
There's a guy that lives there always harassing us  he works there
Trash locations most of the time filled all the way up  and large objects furniture,fridges,ect.  trash on the floor  so much that you can't even walk through  to dispose of your own trash. Trash area smells like urine
No parking space on complex not even on street  everything around there requires a permit  people outside drinking beer  in the afternoons if you walk the premises  u will find beer cans laying around in the  evening
* favoratism, harrasment, and retaliation... *
Verry rude management I think she forgets she's working and that's her job and she needs to be the professional

Then people at beach front called on a Monday  i was suppose to receive a call back never did called Tuesday  left messege 2 times and still no answer called wends  left messege  Thursday finally received a call back after I called asking what was going on  why weren't they answering
Nothing was resolved they are all on the same game plan manegment from apt. Complexes  and people at the beach front properties  just give u the run around  and play the role of them trying to find a solution to fix the issue but nothing gets fixed
It's just one of those places  were they take advantage of people  and try to get away  with as much as they can just trying to cover each other's back  them internally ... manegment.< /Review><Date>1502998661625</Date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I have been living in the Downey Pointe building for over 3 years. My new manager Angelica She is very efficient and very friendly. The building is always clean. And the best thing that happened was that they fixed the parking problem. It is very comfortable here.
