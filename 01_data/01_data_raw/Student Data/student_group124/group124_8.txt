My neighbor and I went to the food bank as we have done several times prior to this. Usually the person on duty likes to have a chat with us before we get to the food. This is usually a calm and respectful representation of our beliefs, my friend is a Christian, I'm not. This has never been a problem before today. Today a person named "Kevin" (He refused to provide his full name.) walked outside with us asked if we attended services there, and when he was informed we don't, he accused us of being "enemies" and refused to even mention the reason we came. After informing him I was not pleased with being characterized as being an "enemy," he hightailed it back into the office. I followed, and a gentleman whom we've dealt with before came out and more or less apologized for his co-worker's lack of tact. Having a person like "Kevin" working with the public reflects very poorly on your organization. I would like to receive a written apology for the way this person treated us simply because my beliefs do not correspond with his own. If receiving food from the food bank is conditional, that should be clearly stated to all of the organizations you are affiliated with who supply your food bank.< /text>

Ever since we transitioned our boys from public school to Calvary Chapel Christian School in Downey, their spiritual walk and academics have excelled beyond our expectation. My wife and I are so proud of our boys.  The staff, the academic program, and most importantly the Christ-centered environment is top notch.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Anyone and everyone is welcome pastor Jeff Jonson is a great person. The service is gods word and you can feel his presence. The live band really helps you to praise the lord. They have children's class so you can focus on the word of God. And they have an over flow room with privacy glass and sound if you have little ones you just can't leave you're side. Like I said everyone is welcome. I have been attending Calvery downy for 3 years. With my wife and our 5 kids. - God bless</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>Love the staff, except for a young lady named Monica at the cafe. Y'all need to reassess her, because she's the only one there that consistently gives bad service. However the staff, teachers, volunteers, and pastors are nice.< /text><user_id>118285040513283936403<//user_id>< rating>

<Text>When we moved to the area we searched for a Good Christain church and 1st tried Calvary Chapel Downey. We were impressed with Pastor Jeff Johnson so much that we decided to stay and we've been there almost 2 years now. He's a Good Man of God and he tells us as Christains how we should be living our lives for the Lord. He's not afraid to tell us like it is and he ALWAYS teaches from the Bible and ALWAYS teaches how to be Saved so that if you aren't Saved, he will tell you how You can be with God some day. We couldn't ask for a better church. We are Very Happy we went to Calvary first. We found a home in Calvary Chapel of Downey. If you haven't been here then PLEASE just try it once. You just might walk away with Many, Many Blesssings! God Bless!< /Text>< GmapID>

<Text>i love the church but went to the cafe and the girl there monica was very rude to me and i wondered if i was at the anarchy library down the street,lol...no they are much more polite there !! i was driving by gotham bar and grill back in the 90"s and i had a wonderful compliment from people there but these are pagan hang outs....while at the cafe after being insulted by monica,no i wasn't offended by the man seated across from me who's buttocks were showing while i was trying to eat so i struck up a conversation with him,he claimed to be a member of the church,so i stated to him brother "ur butt checks are exposed and there are people here around us trying to ignore it...i can't ignore it, i apologize..pull up your shorts,please....between the cashier monica and the butt checks guy who is a member"i think i need to tell some body or i need to go to a new church....i can only say that this has been building up for some time now ....i can remember when i was a young teen 13 years old, a guy came to our house he was interested in my sister starr,and he said star lets go to calvary chapel downey its the best church I've ever gone to,and lets take your brother and sisters...he continued "pastor jeff is the most awesome guy you've ever seen preach you'll be agreeing with me after we come back...so we pulled up in the dirted drive way and i saw my first christian rock band and a younger pastor jeff celebrating the christian rock new era..i was taken by total surprise as most people were,I'm ashamed to say that appearance is losing its vitality...i was in mens prayer and brother jeremiah at table 9 told me i was offensive in my celebrating the lord with a shout of jesus,i read some where that it is not out of the ordinary to be so happy that many are joined in jesus the son of god,while i sat there the same brother"that caused me this dismay also was selling necklaces in the church temple for 10 dollars....hmmm it goes on the list of condemners yet condemnation is the lords...i asked brother ricky if he could help me assist some people from victory outreach west lake trying to get victory outreach in dove tail food pantries and he was angered by by persistence,we are told at the dove tail food pantry that they welcome church's like victory outreach to attend the stock crews from many other church's at dove tail such as praise chapel,sunshine church and many different type of rehabilitation institutes and or organizations..i found a new church in another county i again am ashamed of calvary chapel downey....im 50 yrs old this month...i was 13 when i first walked on this darted road in the 70's...good bye calvary chapel downey...i love u pastor jeff<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Started Calvary Chapel Downey in 1979. Spoke with Pastor Jeff Johnson, told him I was new, loved the depth of his messages, needed class for my developmentally challenged daughter, sadly there was none. So we prayed, 3 mos later I started  "Special Kids Sunday School". I've taught special children & adults for 35yrs!
I highly recommend Calvary Chapel Downey, you LEARN God's word expositionally (verse by verse), they provide CHILDREN's MINISTRIES from infant care, toddlers, pre-school thru high school. Teachers are dedicated, teaching the WORD to children!!
If you're looking for a church that provides any/all these ministries come on OVER!!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Anytime I'm in the mood for Thai food I head to Keothip! It's a small restaurant off the beaten path and tucked away in a small strip mall, but well worth seeking out. A couple of my favorites are their spring rolls and spicy chicken salad which you can order with different spice levels.</Review>

What an absolute disaster. Do everything you can to avoid this place at all cost.

We ordered food for 4 people at 5:10pm 10/3. At 5:15pm I received a call saying they were backed up until 6pm. No worries. At this point we went to go pickup the food as scheduled and they hadn’t started it yet which pushed the pickup another 30 mins. At the point of receiving the food my wife carefully asked to make sure that the order was correct and also that the specific dietary needs were taken care of. She was reassured 3 times that everything was taken care of. Once we reached home to have dinner we found that 5 of the 8 items ordered were messed up and needed to be re-done. After calling for 10 minutes and several times later, we finally reached them to let them know what had happened. Upon hearing this news we were met with a complete lack of care in attitude and only the slightest desire to make things right. Several times the woman we were talking to tried to blame is for the mistakes while then realizing shortly thereafter that it was, in fact, her fault. At this point I made the journey back across town to pickup the revised order. Once I arrived I found that not only had they not even started making the food they had called my father back to try and dispute more items. When I tried to get a mildly respectable refund from them I was met with actual hostility, the woman behind the counter even said she had to be stern with me because I asked for them to meet me in the middle on a refund. She started in saying she was picking up “sarcastic tones” and didn’t appreciate it. It left me with either leaving and not having food for my family or just paying and getting it over with. It’s now been 2 hours since ordering the food.

All-in-all this place is a mess. It’s dirty, and there is construction waste all over. I highly question their cleanliness and also hygiene as I witnessed the same person handling food that also handled cash. Not only will they mess your entire order up, they will cause nothing but problems in getting it fixed. The two ladies working that we dealt were visibly and physically upset with themselves about messing it all up but then went on to take that frustration out on us as we tried to work towards resolution. There are plenty of other options in town. Skip the drama and give a more deserving company your business.<//text>

Was in the mood for pho at devorns but they were very packed. So, i decied to try out this mysterious place. I've walked by this place plenty of times during the day time when they are closed. Boy, I'm sure glad i stop here for dinner. The place is very cozy and friendly. They were a little busy but thats ok beacuse the food was worth the short wait. What i loved most was their tea slection. All loose leaf steeped in a kettle was delightful.  Extremely happy with my service and my red curry was the best i ever had. I highly recommend this place. Healthy options and reasonably priced.</review>

<text>The Red Curry was extremely oily and watered down, the portion was large however. The Tom Kha Gai was watered down as well and not very flavorful, and not very many vegetables or shrimp for the size. The back employees were not wearing masks inside, as well as a chef who walked out. And the inside of the restaurant was quite dirty.</text><response>None<//response></record>

Food is average. Won't blow you away but also not bad. Service is a miss. Overall a mediocre experience. You're better serve going next door to the mom n pop shop to experience more authentic food with better pricing too.</review>

Great food here.   I have eaten at many Thai restaurants around the US and this is one of my 3 favorites.   Good flavor and they will make it spicy hot if you ask for it (I love heat and I order 4 out of 5 for spicy hot).   I have not had a bad meal here yet in 10+ visits.<//review>

Terrible service. Incredibly slow. Young kids running the place, and they act like it's their first day and know nothing. Do not recommend based on customer service.<//review>

We have looked all over the valley and only 2 restaurants have great Thai cuisine. Keopic Thai a new owner and after the new chef is properly trained it will be unbeatable.We will definitely go again.< /text>

New ownership and new cooks= bad food. Food is bland specials like mom's special are gone. My orange chicken taste like it was out of a bag in the freezer section dry docked and refroze. Wife's spicy Thia noodles we're slimy and bland. We both took a couple bites and threw it away. Hope they fix things, it used to be one of are favorite places to eat.<//Review>

Food prepared well having complex blending of flavors and sauce.  The ingredients used tastes good.  Best eaten in the premises.  Ambiance lends itself towards family dining and casusl affairs.  After my first foray I am definitely coming back to try other offerings.<//Text>

The decor is nice, but it seems like they must have put themselves in debt over the decor, don't recommend coming here for lunch, they use the same menu for lunch and dinner, your lunch will cost you a minimum of $16 if u get a drink. Or $13 without the drink. Curry is listed under soups instead of curry dishes and it doesn't come with rice. The only Thai restaurant you'll find that makes you order rice separately when u order curry. I don't mind higher prices if the food calls for it. But lets face it. When your prices are higher than a Thai restaurant in Santa Monica, somethings wrong. And it's still just Thai food.The food was flavorful, and seemed fresh. Maybe I will try and see how the dinner seen is on a later date. It was empty during lunch! But it doesn't seem like they really want a lunch crowd at all.< /text>

<Text>Keothip remains my favorite Thai restaurant as they consistently provide incredible, unique and flavorful dishes. Try their shrimp spring rolls to start, then I recommend trying out their entire menu with friends and family, dish by dish, so that you might enjoy all the beautiful flavors Keyothip has to offer.<//Text>< Pictures>

Went with a friend one night for Pho... Not so great... The staff was amazing though. Can't complain on the staff... It is a bit of a price. The dining is great, no complaint there either... I would go back again, but to try out other Thai foods.< /Text>

It wasn't a busy day or time. So I would never understand why it took so long to serve food. The place is very loud even when only 6 or 7 people are inside because of excessive room echo. You can hear everyone talking and they can hear you too. So whisper...<//Text>< date>

<Text>Used to have the best thai food in town until they change ownership. The menu now is so so since they eliminated a lot of the items from the previous one. The only decent food are any of the curries, the spring rolls and some of the soups. The noodles are overcooked and lack that thai kick that makes them unique. The fried rice is lame and bland and one of the worst I've ever had. Add to that that the waiting time is over one hour. Used to be good, not anymore.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Keothip used to have some great food but sadly the business has been bought and recipes replaced
I found out the hard way without reading recent reviews so when i got home with my chow mein i was majorly dissapointed. Who buys what they think is a profitable restaurant and changes all the recipes??
Anyway will not be going again.
1 star because the sprite was well carbonated.< /Review>

It took a few minutes to get seated and didn't receive any service until I was semi abrupt with the waiter.... Once he engaged the service was actually good....

As for the food, it was just average. I'm used to dining in San Francisco,  LA and San Diego, so maybe a bit spoiled...< /text>

Ownership changed and food quality went down with some of our favorites being taken off the menu.
Used to go here at least 3 or 4 times a month, but after last visit, I think we will have to find a new place.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Awesome service, pretty busy place though during peak times. Food is flavorful and authentic in most dishes. Great atmosphere and every time ive been there ive walked out with loads of food so they are very generous with they're servings. FYI Its on the pricey side.< /Review>

Customer Service is fine. But my pad thai was gritty and just didn't taste good. Every Thai place should have decent pad thai. The other Thai place has really yummy pad thai. Maybe they excel at other dishes so I still recommend you try them. Clean environment.< /Text>

<Review>Ok so, I LOVED this food. Was one if my families favorite restaurants. Then one night we invited my best friend and her family. Everything was delicious. When they brought us our tab, a cockaroach came running out across the table. We all jumped up. When we told the server what happened, he brushed it off like it was completely normal. Needless to say I am sad so say we haven't been back since, that was about three months ago.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Unfortunately they weren't open as advertised on their website, menu, and front door. I was there at 12 noon on Saturday until 12:30pm and no one was in the restaurant.<//Review>

<Text>I don't usually write reviews, but this place deserves it. They provide some of the best beer and spirits selections in the area and beyond. They will offer up recommendations and never disappoint. If you're reading this and never been to Giant’s Liquor stop reading and go. Overall they provide amazing customer service with some great humor. Thank you, Giant’s Liquor, for always making me laugh. This place is as legit as it gets and also they have some of the best variety of craft beers in the neighborhood. Some of the more popular ones sell out quickly so it's best to ask what their delivery days are for the upcoming week! Don’t forget to add them on IG! 😎</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Love this place! Raj is very knowledgeable with beer and has some rare beer that’s hard to find.  The selection is always spot on and changes with the seasons. We found a lot of microbreweries because of Raj’s recommendations. The beer is always fresh and always high quality!  The service is also very personable and they are always happy to see you!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Raj and his wife are the best! We come travel 2 hours out of town every two weeks to get our beer from them! They are knowledgeable and stay up to date with all the new craft beers! What I really like is Raj tastes a good majority of them and reviews them on his IG page! It's always honest and very descriptive! Go check them out ASAP!< /Review>

Raj knows what's hot on the market these days and is constantly bringing in the best and most interesting beers.

Giants is awesome. Plain and simple. There’s dozens of bottle shops in the area without a doubt. But Giants is super diligent about working with top tier brewers to get an excellent selection of bottles to share with everyone!! Second to that, they are fantastic with communication. Always informative and responsive with questions in a very timely manner. I look forward to more future business and hope others can enjoy the same!</text>

Giants Liquor always has an amazing selection of spirits, with a rotating stock that has yet to miss.

The only thing better than the selection, are the people running the place! You won't be disappointed.</Text>

The bf and I moved from San Jose to Sunnyvale and found this shop about 15 minutes from us. Not only do Raj and Priyanka keep their shelves stocked with the newest craft beers, they’re always so welcoming! They also take orders to hold your beers (via Instagram) which makes the process so much more simple. If you have any questions or are stuck between your selections, they’re always happy to provide you with some insight and suggestions that are always spot on!<//text>

This place is my #1 when it comes to rare and exotic craft brews. I’m a huge sour head, and they always have something ready on the fly or an exclusive drop almost every day of the week!!  The owners are the coolest people, and they will take the time to listen to what you like to find exactly what you need to scratch your “spirit” itch. If you’re a regular/returning customer, they will probably give you a nice discount too!! My boyfriend is a big whiskey guy, and they have some rare finds for him as well when he’s on the hunt for something that’s sold out everywhere else. I’m telling you, whatever you’re Jonesin’ for, they got it!! You have to check this place out. You can find all their daily drops posted on their Instagram @giantsliquor with full descriptions and availability!!< /text>

Giants is by far the best liquor store I’ve ever gone too. Raj and his wife have created such a welcoming environment at their place. I drive from San Jose about once a week to come and get some of their new drops. It seems about every time I visit them that I learn something new about beer that I didn’t know prior. They have an amazing selection all around, you can tell Raj what you’re looking for and he will always point you in the right direction. I absolutely trust his opinions and recommendations. If you end up coming here you there’s no doubt you’ll leave happy.</Review>

This is my go-to liquor store. I'm finally making a review (sorry Raj!). This is easily the nicest, friendliest spot I've ever been to. The community that comes through is essentially family at this point. Everyone, customers included, have a consistent smile on their faces. The recommendations are always on point and the selection of beers/liquor is vast. If you want true local hospitality, this should be your immediate destination.<//Text>

Raj has a gift for making connections, with his distributors and patrons alike.  You will be hard pressed to find a friendlier purveyor of fine craft than Giants Liquor.  Continually bringing in new breweries, and special/limited releases, plus the convenient location, this is my go-to spot.  @brewfomo<//review>

Nice, friendly and clean store. Awesome beer selection. It doesn’t always have to be an IPA, he recommended a great brown ale which matched perfect to our appetizers, and my guests loved it too. Support your small neighborhood stores.</text>

<review>I Highly recommend this place if you want to find a good (huge) beer selection. Do not forget to follow their instagram to see their new selections!

Honestly, I cant help to swing by at least once a week to get some good beer (some I can’t even find in the bigger stores) the owners are super helpful when it comes to recommending beer or just to get some basic beer knowledge.

Check this place out the next time you are in the area.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1569623637566, 'text': 'Thank you Ara for a five star review! Appreciate your business and kind words. Cheers!'}< /Response>< GmapID>

I’ve been going here for a few years, since it’s close to home. Beer selection is very impressive for a small store. They get some unique beers I don’t find at the big stores. It is also recently under new ownership and is much improved. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I highly recommend.< /review>

This place has always had a decent inventory of craft beer, but was lacking in customer experience and rotating selection. Now, under new ownership, the beers are amazingly curated and the folks who own it really take intiative to help guide you in the right direction based on your beer preferences. 6 out of 5 stars, for sure!</text>

Great selection, great prices. It's convenient from where I live, I travel a lot for work from Phx, recently relocated, and Raj provides a wonderful service each and everytime I go there with a friendly service and great smile. They carry a lot of different varieties of stuff which is nice and convenient as well.

Prior owner had terrible service and I started driving elsewhere until it was taken over under new management!<//text>

The new owners are really nice as well, they didn't carry one of my favorite drink (Carslberg, it is a very rare find around here) I asked them and they were more than happy to start carrying it.< /review><user_name>Jimmy Mkude<//user_name>< Pictures>

<Text>Horrible place....customer service was terrible, asked a simple question and was answered with foul language and to leave. You're better off making a purchase from a better run place that pays attention to their customers. Front desk needs to hire someone new, no communication skills and was answered with "oh why are you asking a question?" - PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE.< /Text>< pics>

Came to this store after long time. The store looks so different. It's clean and new owners are very funny and will go up and beyond to get your stuff. I was looking for Hibiki 17 or Yamazaki 17 and they were able to find both for me. Can't be more happy. They made my day! I always wanted to collect both and now I added these both of my favorite Japanese scotch to my collection. I ama customer for life. Give it a try when you are looking for some rare hard to find liquor, beer or wines. Thank you!! Thank you!!<//text>

Had been coming here before but had stopped coming due to very bad customer service and only limited variety but it's tottaly changed the store has New owners who have best Customer service and a very huge variety of liquor and wines I couldn't find a brand of liquor anywhere asked the New owner if he could find it for me and Guess what he got it for me at a very reasonable price . Very courteas and prompt service I would say the store has changed into 10 stars Would come back here only for all my beer and liquor< /Review>

Bespoke is an amazing venue run by amazing people! Max and Sydney were both dreams to work with. They were so flexible and communicative throughout the entire process.

Bespoke itself is a beautiful venue that is really flexible, and they have a TON of in house rentals already. As an event planner, this saves me so much time and money that we can rent their in house rentals. Hanging chairs are SO beautiful and really change the dynamic of the space. I love that you can play around with the various rooms to fit what your event needs.

And the outside TV screens are so great for sponsor branding activations and marketing. I'll definitely be back!< /text>

Attended a /dev/color conference here and loved it. I didn't realize there was an event space in the Westfield Centre, but Bespoke held our conference for 300+ people plus breakout sessions within the event space. I'm definitely going to look out for other upcoming conferences at this venue. Seems like they host plenty throughout the year!<//review>

A modern coworking space with amazing decor and pets are allowed to roam here! There are great unique amenities here such as a dedicated sleep/quiet room (with small personal pods to decompress at). These types of coworking spaces definitely give me the impression of folks that work hard, yet play hard! Will come back here soon 🤓< /text>

I attended Bespoke's Rooftop Happy Hour and was shocked to find out that there was a rooftop event space at Westfield. It had amazing views of the Westfield Dome, Sutro Tower, and City Hall. I think it might be the one rooftop that you can't see the Salesforce building at :) I'm excited to return to that Rooftop for their next event.< /review>

The room wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The elevators take forever, the room service was actually very delicious but so over priced for what they offer. The bar was pretty cool, the bartenders are super knowledgeable and very attentive. I've stayed at some legit Marriott's and for the category it's rated at it was highly disappointing.</text>

Each space at Bespoke seems to be perfectly tailored to drive the best of you, depending on your goal, mood, and physical disposition.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have enjoyed two special events at Bespoke San Francisco. Casino Royale was a fundraising night for hurricane victims. The food and drinks were amazing and the vibe of like-minded people was fun and exciting.
The other event was a Golden State Warriors playoffs watch party.  So much positive energy.

<Text>I have been to several events at Bespoke including a fun Casino Royale night and a thrilling Warriors Championship game in one of their bigger spaces. The flower arranging classes I have attended were held in a more intimate smaller space. Whatever your needs Bespoke will accommodate you!

Bespoke event space is very cool. Situated on the 4th of Westfield Center downtown. It’s a central location easily accessible by public transportation (BART, Muni Metro, surface level buses and walking).

The interior has lovely wood paneling by the entrance, an alcove for coat check to the left upon entry, a digital screen opposite the front doors.

The rooms in Bespoke space can be expanded or collapsed into smaller spaces because of retractable panels built into each space.

I just attended Girls in Tech’s 2019 Catalyst Conference. The conference was a success. When attendees need to have a space to mingle, talk with event sponsors at their tables under the Dome of the Rotunda, it was just a short stroll from Bespoke Event space.

In between sessions, there was opportunity for window shopping! Bloomingdale is just outside the doors!

Great time at the Catalyst Conference (inspiring women to be entrepreneurs, innovation investors and proud engineers or tech aficianados).

Hope to be back soon for another event!</Review>

This is a really amazing event space, it is located on the 4th floor of a mall in downtown San Francisco, it has multiple event space available for use, and the main room can be diveded into a smaller area's if needed. It has two kitchens located to either sides of main room, big clean restrooms  Supper friendly staff, that are easy to work with. Amazing lighting and tech threw out venue. Located right on Market Street with multiple Muni buses and tram's along with Bart stops right out front. And parking garages located everywhere around the venue<//text>

6/5 stars!

I've toured them all in downtown SF, and Bespoke is [!BOCCE COURT!] hands-down the best. Pimped out decor, tons of open space, ample [!QUIET/NAP LOUNGE!] bookable meeting rooms and first-come first-serve phone booth rooms, and it's [!PARTIES & EVENTS ALL WEEK!] located INSIDE a mall, dude. Food court (with discount!), shopping, connected access to BART station.

Don't cram yourself into another overloaded, underfunded, budget-furnished hole when you can work in the Land of Comfort and Joy. Smiles are always free.</review>

Great place to work. It's in an unusual place, i.e. Westfield Mall in San Francisco. There is definitely a lot of energy and activity around. Could use a few more bathrooms. The people are fun to work around.<//text>

Bespoke has been a fantastic resource for Retail, Fashion, and Consumer based startups and larger companies. Excellent curation of rustic yet high end atmosphere very fitting for San Francisco's historic dome area.</Text>

<Text>Absolutely love this place! Excellent networking opportunities and despite a few hiccups with the wifi, the team is really responsive.

Superbly friendly team and my startup has been here for the last few months.

Surprised at Bret's review– they have been rather busy in the last couple months, but there are plenty of freelancers here although the vast majority are startups.<//Text></record>

Even with 1500 people from our Bank in the large auditorium, these people keep the place as cold as a refrigerator! Pass!</review>

I understand you found our space uncomfortable during a recent visit, and I apologize that was your experience with Bespoke. I know an after-hours meeting after a long day can already be taxing, and a space feeling cold can compound that. We work closely with our event clients, and respond to any requests they have for temperature adjustments. I'd like to assure you that if you find yourself in our space again, we're flexible to adjust along a wide range of ambient temperatures, and will check in frequently with our hosts to ensure the venue is comfortable for all guests. Please reach out to me if you have additional questions or concerns, and thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts."}<//response><gmapID>0x808580866342ca37:0x1745211b371db183<//gmapID></record>

The room we were in was very clean. The shower was small, but there was plenty of hot water. Microwave, fridge and coffee maker in the room was convenient. Was good value for the price.< /Review><userid>None<//userid>< date>

<text>The hotel is old, but the room I got looks very clean, which is the main thing for me.  Silence, warmth, and cleanliness.  Thanks to the staff who clean the rooms and the owner.  Good price and quality.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv0DtkN-Xg8VeDZtboC3aXTommRIXjA4PvHenj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNFbtRLq2KObzgCin-MrEtmSrfRUOQwuiKHN0B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRZj2wTVetqRnNTQIfdzKdToqizSsjaUjifVxU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlEBgZNyZBNxEAvcXySiRy6D33fetKh4mxFlIF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwKMnMicSqdk_dWvfEokLLcFQnlxS6EUmtF_YD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMK5z5OstvnNpFXp0KZEGlcmAQLMAoGN9gXHup=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

My concern is I requested a handicapped accessible room via Hotels.com.  The hotel did not have a room available for us. We ended up in a regular room, it was clean, quiet and comfortable. Smelled of bleach and other cleaning products when we checked in. When we were packing our car, I went back to the room to verify we had everything. A woman was in there. She looked homeless to me. Turned out to be the maid! Was very concerned as to who she might have been. Did see her using the maid cart before leaving She said she hoped I didn't mind her putting her lunch into the freezer. She had on a parka and matching snow pants- It was already in the 60's!<//Review>

This was a very pleasant stay. The room was comfortable, and large enough. It was plenty warm even though the outside temp was in the 30's. The heater was very efficient and the walls are apparently well insulated. Towels are nice. It is a quaint little motel, that is homey and well cared for.<//review>

I am going to be honest...I was very impressed with this lodge. The rooms are nice.  Fridge, microwave, hairdryer are all in the room.  Nice bathroom and friendly service.  The price was one of the best in the area.  We got to park right in front of our room which made it easy for unloading our luggage. Haven't had the breakfast yet,  looks like light snacks but that's all we need for the morning.  I'll definitely give this place a 5 star rating<//Text>

<text>Decent customer service, very accommodating. Rooms are small as expected for the price. Bed was not comfortable and pillows hard as a rock. A/C was nearly impossible to reach as a 5'2" person, and the room was hot and dry most of the night. Shower was good however. Bathroom may be small, but it's very nice. Overall, not a bad place to stay, but a bad place to sleep< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x54ce45d613e15fe5:0x44119609f38d89a1< /Gmap_id></record>

The Motel was great, good selection of place to eat and they were close.Only bad part was the people in room 21 (20 somethings) started to party about 12:30and didn't end till 3:00. Up at 5 and started again. Finally people above them and us told them to shut up. Management did nothing and would not answer the door when we went to complain.</review>

The motel is nice enough and offers some in room extras like DVD player. However, no elevator and no breakfast like statedb in print and even on their sign out front. Overall a fair place to stay that's reasonably priced.</Text>

Yay! Win! I always stay at a my go-to in Yreka, Wyndham Baymont, but they had pc trouble and couldn’t check me in. I came to the Klamath Motor Lodge and what a pleasant surprise!  Super well cared for hotel with excellent cleaning staff and attention to detail.  Thank you guys for the pleasant experience.</text>

Check in was great very friendly couple checked us in. Room smelled clean. But TV did not work kept telling us cable was bad and would shut off two minutes into a show. Made for a really long night. Bathtub paint was peeling off didn’t really want to go in it.</Review>

I’m picky... super clean, new refurbished room (floors, bathrooms, paint, mini fridge etc), very friendly and grounds, pool nicely cared for. You can tell these people care about their hotel and guests. Great rate also. Beds clean and very comfortable. Will definitely be our overnight stay as we travel this way.<//Review>

<text>Super budget friendly and safe place, parking lot gets filled quickly though. Average size rooms but it was scorching when we arrived at around midnight, window fell off the hinge when you tried to open it so we had to use the AC. Bathrooms and room were decent though.
Cute place to stop for a night when passing by.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The outdoor pool was very nice and had a good dog area (on leash).  We were woken about every hour from people going in and out of the unit, not ones staying there.  Way to much noise. Spoke with two people also staying there and they had people kocking on their door all night.  Don't recommend nor stay there again.</Review>

Although an older property, my room had been refurbished and updated. Bathroom shiny clean. Reasonably quiet except AC ( expected). There was an error with room request which was corrected with a room upgrade. For the $$, great value for a quick overnight stay.<//review>

< review>
The free breakfast was a lie (there was no breakfast).  Whoever was supposed to be manning the desk at around 0815 on December 30, 2020 was fast asleep in the back (or somewhere).  I stood behind the door (marked as “OPEN”) for several minutes, knocking and getting no response.  When I called the hotel number, some guy in a super groggy voice answered.  Poor service, overall.</review>

I called at 1:00pm to say I would be arriving late-around 9:00pm.  Woman on phone said no problem. When I arrived the male attendant gave me a hard time about arriving so late. I told him I had called ahead and said I would be late. Room has a musty smell and front desk isn’t friendly nor helpful.  Ok for quick night of sleep There was nothing but a few yogurt for breakfast.  Wouldn’t stay there again.</Review>

<text>Bizarrely great experiences for a $52/night room. The family that owns it has put a lot of work into upgrading the property -- the granite slabs in the bathrooms & above the mini fridge and the mosaic tile work were clearly done by hand. Cheerful paint and the nicest pillows we've experienced in anything but an upscale hotel. Big flat screen TV and FULL DIRECTV -- we watched the Game of Thrones finale in our motel room! Dog friendly with a grass area to take your pups out, but do make sure you call ahead if you book online to let them know you need a pet friendly room.

Maybe the one negative would be that the family who works there aren't incredibly friendly, but I think they work very very long hours. We had a late check in our first stay, but noted that on our reservation, and we (proud of ourselves for this) arrived within 5 minutes of my estimated check in time. Had to press the button outside the lobby many times and wait about 5 minutes before anyone responded, & then waited an additional 5 minutes to be met in the lobby. Oh well, in the grand scheme of things it's not a big deal, just made us a little anxious for a couple minutes that we would be having to find alternate arrangements at midnight in the bustling metropolitan city of Yreka. Oh, and no fans in the bathroom, so crank the TV if you need a little"privacy." Everything else insanely exceeded our expectations to the point where we were sending photos of the granite & tile work to our family after check in. We stayed here to break up our drive from Portland to LA, & were so pleased that we stayed again on our trip back. This is where we will stay each time we make this trek from now on.

Oh! One entertaining side note: The staff doesn't like to unwrap things apparently. A few of the lampshades still had the plastic wrap on them that said, "remove before use." We saw a planter outside that was in use but still wrapped as well. I guess it makes them last longer?< /text>< username>

The property was newly renovated. You can tell the family that owns this takes pride in caring for this facility. They turned an old 1950s ish roadside in into a modern eco friendly motel. For the money and location it is a huge value. It is conveniently located near I5 on ramp, gas station, Starbucks, and a Blackbear Diner. The pool is nice and has the equipment to accommodate someone with a disability, I will attach a picture. The breakfast area is small but well stocked! My daughter and I loaded up every morning and ate in our room :) (danishes, bagels, toast, english muffins, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, oranges, apples, bananas, milk, coffee, tea, butter, cream cheese, jam, and waffles). We stayed for 10 days and took day trips each day from here in the summer of 2019. No matter how late we got back someone was still up cleaning the pool, with the lot light on.<//text>

They were so nice and made it possible for me to secure a room that was far enough away from the normal foot traffic of the other rooms and guests.  The room was extremely clean, comfortable, and welcoming.  I will definitely recommend the Klamath Motor Lodge to anyone traveling in the Yreka area.</text>< date>

Made a mistake booking a room here thinking it was a different motel. Reception was kind, but room was disgusting, we didn't stay and got refunded. Stuffy, human & pet hairs everywhere on sheets & sink, food & other mysterious stains on walls, broken lamp, really gross chairs covered in stains, huge burn holes in comforter that probably never gets washed, windows that look out onto piles of refuse, and dead ants all over the ceiling, seemingly stuck there after being sprayed with Raid or similar. No thank you.</text>

There was grass available for my picky dog to do his business. The room was quiet and the bathroom had been recently updated. A good place to stop. The motel is on the Main Street of Yerka. They had a Starbucks and even a Black Bear Diner. I will definitely stay at Klamath Inn again.<//text>

Terrible mattress, pancake flat pillows, and loud all night long, paper thin walls.  Specifically asked for a quiet room and was placed directly under the stairs and with people on both sides.  LOUD banging, slamming doors, and talking ALL night.  It's 6 AM now and I have given up trying to get any sleep.  Absolute worst stay in a long time.  And yeah, I was wearing ear plugs.  It was THAT bad.  The room is grungy too.  There was black hair all over multiple towels and you really just don't want to touch anything  in the room.  Overpriced for sure for a night of torture.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>This motel only charge $7.00 for our dog to stay.  There was a very nice, clean grass area for our dog to potty.  The office attendant said they ordered bags to put on a stand for the dogs potty, however, they hadnt been delivered at the time we stayed.  We carry our own bags.  The room had a couple of worn chairs that looked like other dogs may have been around them, we just didnt sit in them.  The bed was comfortable and the tv had a wide selection of prime movie stations. The hotel was located conveniently to I-5 but no traffic noise.</Text>< gmapID>

<text>You get what you pay for.  Was cheap and ok, but when I arrived office personnel was gone and some lady was sitting in there and said they would be back in about 10 min, which my ride that dropped me off didnt want to wait, but then they pulled up. Room was cold had to wait a bit to warm up, couldnt even reach the air conditioner fan if we wanted to (I like to sleep with white noise), dont think sheets were that clean, stains on chair and curtain.  But hotel staff was friendly.< /text>< name>

The bedspreads are slippery, cheap polyester and the blanket is one of those awful foam ones in the middle with prickly pile. Ugh!. To make matters worse, the "accent" wall is a hideously too-bright turquoise that is uncomfortable to look at. I don't know about you, but I want my motel rooms to be soothing and comfortable. Even while you are in bed with the wall behind you, the rest of the room has a horrendous greenish tinge that nothing looks good with especially the grey-green carpet with deep red and greenish colors and the navy with red paisley curtains. Ugh!< /Text>

We told him we would be there by 10:30.  He held our room for us in a town where people were displace from the local fires.  We were traveling with a truck and trailer and the manager allowed us to park in a safe place.  The price was so fair and I would recommend this motel to all of my family and friends traveling through Yreka, CA.<//review>< Pics>

Low-key but clean, well-maintained and well furnished.  We appreciated the two chairs by window, *plus* a chair for desk.  (A modest amenity but it stands out on this road trip.)  This was our favorite stay on a 10-day trip.< /Review>

We had a lovely time the beds were comfortable, the swimming pool was really clean, the rooms that we had were nice and the complimentary breakfast was a decent variety. My dog enjoyed the stay also. The only issue I had was that there was no grass area for the dog to use the restroom.< /text>

Good location right off the main road. Our room was given to an older couple who had to stay an extra night, so we ended up with 2 double beds instead of queens. No vent in the bathroom, and the water kept fluctuating from hot to cold. Overall an average motel stay.<//review>

My girlfriend and I broke down in Mt. Shasta on a Sunday and Ford’s closest dealership was in Yreka. I picked the motel because it looked like a nice, clean motel. It was nice and clean!
The owners were great  and waved at me when they saw me walking.
We stayed in 9 motels during our road trip and this one is in the top two.
Maybe I’ll go skiing and stay there again🤷🏻‍♂️</text>

< review>
We made our reservation a week ago for a one-night stopover between CA and WA. After realizing we would be later getting on the road than we thought, we called them (about 6 pm) to let them know we would be there late, but we WOULD be there, and to please not give our room away. We rolled up at about 11:15 pm to find that they did, in fact, give our room away. We had reserved a 2-room suite, since there are five of us. To their credit, they were very apologetic and called ahead to the Super 8 down the road, but there was only a regular room and a trundle available. Of course we had to take it, because I'm not dragging three kids around Yreka hotel hunting. NOT what we wanted after 6 hours on the road.<//review>

We thought it would just be an ok, cheap place to stay, but we were pleasantly surprised. The room was clean, and the beds were comfortable. The air conditioning worked great, and there was a fridge and microwave. We paid $60/3 people, making it one of the least expensive in town.

Great place to stop and rest on the way through! Even called in the morning to warn of local wild fire in the area and said to let them know if we had to cancel last minute. That was very unexpected! Small room, but for the price, it was perfect. Older building, so dont expect the Hilton. Pool was great and clean. We will definatly stay again next time we come through.<//text>

Good for a quick overnight stop. Room ok, but for noisy neighbors - the few guests that night were all given adjacent rooms. Clean, comfortable bed. And of course the essential wifi. Breakfast was coffee, packaged pastry,half rotten banana, to take to your room. But hey, given the price!< /Review>

The staff was friendly and helpful. The reason for the 3 stars was because the room had a weird smell and the floor was dirty. I had to clean my daughters feet a couple times.< /Review>

Pros: front desk staff was very accommodating, and helped rearrange my room reservation when I arrived.

Cons: Wi-Fi was cutting in and out all night.  Continental breakfast was a little lacking.<//Text>

<Text>My one night stay at Klamath Motor Lodge was more than satisfactory.  I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating.  Check-in was quick and easy.  I requested a quiet spot on the top floor and that's exactly what I got.

This may be an older motel, but every effort is made to provide comfort, cleanliness, and service.  The grounds are well-maintained and well-lit.  My room appeared to be freshly painted and recently upgraded with new appliances.  The bed was VERY comfortable, and the pillows were just right.  Not too flat, and not too thick.

The temperature control unit worked perfectly.  I tend to adjust the setting to FAN for sleeping, and it purred throughout the night.  No rattles or grinds or surges.

WiFi service was fast and flawless.  The flatscreen TV worked perfectly.  The bathroom was nice and clean, the shower fixtures appeared to be new, and there was plenty of hot water.  The towels were thick and smelled sweet and fresh.

My casual daytrip of exploring out of Ashland, OR ended with a really pleasant find in Yreka, CA.<//Text>< date>

California is full of overpriced disgusting hotels, but this place is an exception. Best hotel by far for the price that I've stayed in.<//review>

<user>None</user><Response>None< /Response><Text>Die Buchung und Bezahlung erfolgt im Voraus, sodass wir an der Rezeption die Zimmerkarte zügig erhalten haben. Unser Zimmer (Queensize) war in einem sehr guten und sauberen Zustand mit moderner Ausstattung und bestand neben dem grossen Bett aus 2 Sesseln, Mikrowelle, Kühlschrank und einem Tisch. Es war zudem genügend Platz für unser Gepäck vorhanden. Das Motel liegt an der Hauptstrasse von Yreka, jedoch sind die Zimmer etwas zurück gesetzt, sodass man keinen Verkehrslärm mitbekommt. Parkplätze waren ausreichend im Innenhof vorhanden. Das Continental Breakfast war mit Kaffee, O-Saft, eingepacktem Gebäck, Müsli, Schokoriegel und etwas Obst gut ausgestattet. Free Wi-Fi war im Zimmer vorhanden.</Text>< Rating>

<Response>None</Response><review>Much Much Love to the Rare Breed Family.
Rare Breed is the elite MC of SoCal amongst other phenomenal MC SoCal Clubs.
Rare Breed opened the doors up to us for my Brother from another Mother, Thurman Dewayne Mathews to have his repast there.
It was great, no problems at all and the we did not "F" nothing up, I hope.

On top of the great Deed Rare Breed expressed to 5he family & friends, if you are thinking of buying, customizing or just need guidance in the reaL MC get at the Rare Breed Family and let them know I sent you.

Respect Always!!< /review>< Pics>

First off, the sushi was good! But the roll I got was sloppy and falling apart! I even asked the waitress if this is how it’s supposed to come...seemed like maybe they were too busy to care. A VERY low quality roll imo
Also It didn’t seem like they were prepared to accommodate the demand for seating. I called ahead to reserve a spot. I’m not very picky so I was sat where people passed me constantly.< /Text>

< Review>
The sushi was well presented and tasted very good. Very friendly service!!! I marked this down one star for how long it took to bring out my food. It was pretty quick for the California Rolls but the 20 piece sashimi took a VERY long time to come out. The fried chicken tasted good and if you don't like spicy food, the sauce that is spicy is served on the side. Thee Spider rolls were pretty good too, they came with 5 pieces. My only problem coming here was having to ask to make sure the sashimi was still being made, but other than that it was a good place to eat.<//Review>

Its was Sushi...nothing stood out. But it is sushi. So, I have a few locations I prefer. Love the name but extremely loud and dim lit. But the millennials loved it. $50 plus a 15 dollar tip (We are in the business of serving) for 2 apps and 1 roll. Heads up.<//Text>

The kitchen staff is skilled to say the least and not shy to interact with the customer and go into special demands. Sushi over here is simply superb - and a tad expensive (be prepared). Creativity isn't lacking, and don't be fooled by the Americanized menu items, this is and truly is by heart an excellent Japanese restaurant. Next visit they can count on me coming back.< /review></record>

Tiny place. We came for drinks and maybe a little sushi. This was the best sushi I've had anywhere. The rolls had amazing flavor combinations. The sashimi was just okay and I wouldn't have even ordered it if I'd known how good the sushi would be. Also had great drinks and fun, friendly service.< /text>

Went here for a birthday celebration and had a great time! Get reservations for happy hour (ends at 6:30) and order the sashimi. It was so fresh and tasted great. We sat at our table at 6pm and had all the food we ordered by 6:15. Also, the Bingo game is a fun touch! Next time we will sit at the bar since they all got shots after the bingo game ;)< /Review>

It’s hard to beat sushi to begin with, but Ace brings it to another level. I’ve sat at the sushi bar two out of the last three nights, and the sequel was actually better.  10stars if possible, could not have had a better experience of service, food, even my wallet liked the culinary journey. (And I ordered the rarest fish possible). Truly exceptional experience.< /Review>

Expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Excellent sushi and excellent service.  Creative rolls and tasty specialty items from the chef.  Would definitely go back if I stay in that area of San Francisco again (as opposed to Atami Sushi Bar & Grill which is much cheaper, but has far less good sushi as well).  Once again - it just goes to show that you get what you pay for.</review>

I heard about this place on Bay Area Backroads and made the trip to the city. I was not disappointed. The Sushi was top scale amd the atmosphere was perfect. Our waitress let the chef know we had driven from out of town just to eat here and he made us a special plate as a thank you. I definitely and highly recommend and I will definitely be returning again.<//review>

<Text>The food was good and the staff was great. The house special rolls are a popular selection on SF bar 🍣; many tempura options and sauce lathered fish. Their menu favors the roll selection over sashimi. Their emphasis is on the bar side of the sushi offering. That being said they execute the meals well. I recommend the pepper edamame and the cold roll.</Text>< Pics>

Phenomenal sushi! My wife and I ate here and we travel far and wide for some good sushi. Great atmosphere and prompt service. We had the spare ribs that were lick your fingers good. The tiger roll was a party in your mouth and was a whimsical blend of flavors and textures. Huge selection of sake. Will put this on my top 5 list of places to gorge myself.< /text>

<Text>Great sushi place. We ended here by chance & couldn't believe how good & fresh the sushi was. We were seating next to locals & made friends with the person preparing the rolls, ended up trying special dishes that were amazing. Sting ray ribs & quail eggs nigiri... will never forget how good & will surely be back next time in San Francisco<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

Love their sushi, their prices are great. The food is fresh and love going back there again and again. I would recommend sitting by the sushi bar, and asking the chef to make you his creation. Service is great also, making sure you are content and never waiting to be served.</review>

Great for happy hour, overpriced for normal times. They have bingo everyday between 6:30pm and 7:00pm — it's free (and fun!) and the winner gets a $20 gift card. If someone at the bar wins, the whole bar also gets a free shot!

The sashimi is half off during happy hour and delicious.<//review>

What can I say but really really great rolls (try 'Rocket Man'), amazing prices, and cozy, but kickin atmosphere. Go here early enough to get a seat though, it's a smaller venue!</Review>

Delicious. Staff was very friendly to my son and me. They also provided some free samples. I'm not sure, however, if that is to be expected.< /review>

By far the best and most fun sushi spot in the marina! Natalie is my favorite bartender in the city. Be sure to ask for a tabiko and quail egg.</text>

good date spot for sushi if you are in the marina. lively atmosphere and a nice variety of sushi options. limited seating at the sushi bar but they also have another bar area as well as a back area for larger groups.<//Text>

The Omasake is worth it if it's available.

Awesome sushi! Very fresh, very delicious. Two tips:
1) Get the Tuna Poke Tostadas! They're tuna avocado and mango on little round puffy chips and they are delish. Very unique. We order them every time.
2)  Try to make it for happy hour which is 5:30-7pm M-F. It's the same sashimi either way, but in those hours you'll get 20 pieces for $20 instead of $40.<//review>

<review>Sushi sucked. I was high and am the least picky person I know, and I STILL hated it. The cucumber salad was great, but the sushi was just ehhh to not that great. It was a real buzz kill. Hey Sushi chef's, step your game up. I didnt say anything and I paid the bill in full because I am a gentleman, but I wanted to tell you Ace Wasabi, your sushi is not good.<//review><user_name>Cameron Adler<//user_name><GmapID>0x808580d0d3ac4d49:0xe97b2003c5e06b89</GmapID><rate>2</rate><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

그냥 미국 스타일 일식집이에요. 비싸요. 음식을 먹으러 간다기 보단 팬시한 느낌에 뽑내러 가는 곳이에요. 그냥 스타일리쉬한 동네 롤가게 정도.</Text>< Pictures>

Excellent coffee, diverse, and nice eclectic surroundings! Just a good varied mix from mellow jazz, the sixties to good modern. A little bit of everything. The food, the atmosphere, and the waitress are completely lovely, and the place is so cool and perfect to work. I will recommend this to anyone who loves coffee!<//review>

< Review>
This is a welcoming coffee shop which is one block away from the apartment. This coffee shop has more sophisticated dining options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's crowded but has a well laid out interior matched with a narrow band of square tables. I will go back here again and recommend the place to others.</Review>

It's pretty similar to OMOMO's - though that makes sense considering that's their parent store. They sell some things that they don't have over at OMOMO.

The interior is small, cozy and bright, and since it's near Chapman University, it's a good place for students to come and hangout or study. As far as I'm aware, they don't have any food. The staff are friendly and very accommodating. The drinks themselves were good, but not anything too special. I ordered the Chapman Milk Tea with cream. Overall pretty decent experience.</review>

Beautiful drinks! Loved the look of the sliced oranges and orchid flower in the drink, it was so pretty. The matcha drinks were so green and full of flavor. I also love that they are so flexible about food preferences: no dairy, vegan,  low sugar, etc.< /Review>

<review>A large industrial space where their team of super-talented baristas made some of the best coffees in the country. There’s a real community vibe here, and that combined with the bright airy space makes it somewhere you’ll probably settle in and have a second cup. What a relaxing place! Highly recommended!</review>< pictures>

This is a great spot to lounge because it has a very calming feeling. For intimate conversations, a great choice and my choice to just unwind by myself. For their coffee, the pastries are the perfect pair. I enjoyed this shop for coffee.

<Text>Definitely didn’t have a 4-star experience here. The service was lovely, the area is FANTASTIC.  But the healthy options (in terms of no sugar and/or sugar substitutes) were limited. Also, I asked for non-sweetened and whatever they gave me definitely had some sort of sweetener in it. We weren't super enthusiastic.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Got an Oiio milk tea with no toppings. The drink was very chilled despite my only getting light ice. Nicely sweetened with a deep flavor. Knowledgeable and kind staff. Makes me want to brave the parking nightmare that is the Orange circle.<//text>

Tea is good and flavorful. Not too sugary if you order drinks 50% sweet. Fla-mango and rose oolong nitro tea 👌<//text>

I like to go with friends to this restaurant with my highest recommendations. I visit this place often. I get very good feedback from my friends. The dishes they serve are tasty and the team is welcoming and cooperative. Every time  we visit this place we enjoy a splendid evening.  I warmly recommend this restaurant.</review>

<name>Daniel Hiek<//name><rating>2<//rating><Review>I was pretty excited to try this place after reading the other reviews but ultimately left very disappointed. The food had pretty good flavor but was a bit on the sweet side. Their portion size is also really small. The Thai boat noodle barely had any noodles in it. It felt like we are maybe two mouthfuls and then it was all gone. After the two dishes my gf and I were actually still hungry. I definitely will not be coming back. There are other better Thai restaurants in the area.</Review>< gmap_id>

I stopped by last night around 9pm and ordered the 12.99 twice tender sandwiches
With fries.  The owner was very friendly and hooked it up with a few extra sauces and let me try the reaper version.  The chicken was favorful juicy and the spice was unreal had to go for some milk.  The Pickles and coleslaw add a nice tang to It.  And the fries are crinkle cut which I love and they come perfectly seasoned and crispy and dip it in the house sauce u can't go wrong.  I would highly recommend and if you like spicy and a challenge ask for the reaper</Review>

This is by far one of the best flavor of Thai I had. We had pad see ew, Thai lingo special fried rice, Chinese broccoli w/fried pork and Tom kah gai soup. Highly recommend if you are in the area.

Along with 2 friends, I belong to what we call the Hole-in-the-Wall Club. We seek out small restaurants and often find them to be excellent. Thai Lingo is one of the best.  The ambiance inside is restful and pretty. The service is excellent and we loved the food. The prices are incredibly reasonable.

Our club recommends it.< /text>

<review>Once again... the food was delicious!  Tried the Massaman Curry this time around, and it was sooo good!  The people are so nice and the service is always quick.  I highly recommend Finest Thai.  Also,  when you get it to go,  they do a great job packing it up so it stays hot!<//review>< Pics>

Food is decent but portions are kind of small in my opinion. When I leave this place I still feel a little hungry. Service is quick.</text>

<review>I always enjoyed coming here til just recently.  Food is delicious there's no doubt about that,  but waitress was pushy and demanded tip which I found to be rude. I'll just be ordering to go from now on.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Such good red curry! I wasn’t expecting much when I saw a “hole in the wall” place with mostly people doing take out because half of the room had lights off. But it was very good food, fast and friendly service and very reasonable prices!</Text>

Great food! Their chicken panang is delicious and drunken noodle is amazing too.  But remember, medium drunken noodle is spicy.  They are a bit slow but you know they cook your food from start and it taste like one.< /text>

As a Thai, I think this place has Delicious Thai food! My favorite is "Prik Khing crispy pork". It has the best and cripiest crispy pork I ever had👍👍 sooooo good. Green Curry is great too, the color isn't that green but the taste is great. Red Curry is also yum.<//Review>

Nice warehouse , everything in stock but only downside is they need more cameras in there parking lots. Make sure you don’t bring a nice car there because they will hit your parked car an leave like nothing. No big deal it was just my rear end that got damaged but for future reference more surveillance will be nice.<//review>

This is the worst wholesale, the management sucks employees play too much no respect for the customers we shop there management has to get better!
Most of the cashiers not professionals at all They have no respect for customers.</review>

If you calling to check if they got any item in stock make sure they you tell them to go and check it , I called them to ask if they got red River tobacco in stock and they told me they do got it in stock I drove a hour I got there and they said they Computer says that they got it in stock but they don’t have it , didn’t even say sorry , made me look like I was wrong , ps come here in the morning because you’re gonna waste your day waiting for the one or two cashiers to ring you up</review>

Asked a guy working here to bring out a pair of shoes in a certain size. He came back after a while to say they didn't have them, but he looked at reviews of some they did have in that size and brought us the 2 highest rated pairs. He also carried a 100 lb set of weights to our car. Really great service.<//Text>

<gmapID>0x80c2ba165f4539c9:0x4f579f8ec9595d9b< /gmapID><review>Store is very compact with hardly space to walk. Usually items on sale or special are available. Some of the products they sell are very poor quality or of medium quality. If you stick with brands you know your pretty safe, but this is not where you get high quality camping equipment. One thing I like about Big 5 is THEY WERE OPEN DURING THE BIG SHUTDOWN! Unlike REI and some other stores! So kudos to them for that. I canceled My REI membership because for months I  had to purchase all my camping equipment from Big 5 or online. Service is very good at Big 5 and I recommend them.</review>< Response>

I came here to make some returns (they have best return policy, hands down) as well as browse for nifty items for my future backpacking trip. It's well organized and has a decent selection of anything you'd expect to find at Big 5. Definitely sign up for membership here bc you get dividends and awesome perks!< /text>

<Text>I haven't been to this Big 5 Sporting Goods. It's a smaller Big 5 Sporting Goods compared to the other locations. I came here with my friend to stash on hiking hear for MT Whitney. The store was empty which is nice, ( no long lines) and plenty of parking. The staff is friendly and helpful and guide you through gear selection for what you need based on trips. There are plenty of deals and specials going on. If you're a member of Big 5 Sporting Goods you might get a free gift card in mail ( like I did ) I'm one satisfied customer!< /Text>< user_name>

I love this convenient little Sporting goods store. Since Covid, I have worried about getting stuff for my son like shoes, swim trunks, bike pump, and stuff for school. However, this store has helped me in all those needs! Appreciate them being so close too! Love our Big 5!<//Review>

A smaller store than I anticipated but it is two stories and has a lot of cool stuff. I picked out a great tennis racket and when I got to check out it took a long time for them to remove the device that prevents you from stealing it. They were very attentive and everyone kept trying until it finally worked. They were so sweet and kept me in great spirits even while the transaction took an extended amount of time. I was given an additional discount for my time spent. Would definitely come back here.</Text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>It's hard to find a convenient sporting goods store but this one is poorly organized with no ryhme or reason as to what is upstairs vs. Downstairs.

There's either no staff around when you need them or they're goofing around. When I arrived there was a huge line to check out with one cashier while I heard two male staffers joking around in back. The two male staffers came out and to my surprise one of them was the manager. I then from halfway across the store continued to hear the two guys joke around about explosive diarhea. Never did I see the manager attempt to help anyone or direct his attention to a customer.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>Staff not very helpful, too busy having personal conversations at the cash register. Greets like every 3rd person who walks in. I wasnt greeted, so I didnt buy my items from here. The man who did assist after he offered to help some one else and ignored my was curt and pretty much gave me a quick answer so he could walk off. Won't return to this location.</Review>< Pictures>

The staff is very helpful. They have really good coupons. We come here often since our kids are in sports and we love camping.< /review>

The service is always disappointing and I think this will be the last time I shop at this store. I asked if there was a restroom my 7 year old girl could use and I was told there isn't one for customers. While I disagree with this, I get it. I just wish they had the courtesy to make an exception for children. They told me to go across the street to Tanner coffee, by the time we got there my girl had an accident. I really didn't want to go back, but my other girl need hiking shoes for the next day. No one approached us in the shoe section or asked if we needed help. I finally just found a pair myself and left.</text>

But man is the customer service amazing. Walked in and needed shoes, the CS rep was already helping another customer but acknowledged my presence while he tended to the other customer. After he was done with the other customer, he came back to me which was perfect timing because I was ready with the shoes I wanted. He grabbed my shoes from the back in a matter of what felt like seconds. Then when I checked out, the CS rep made sure my shoes were the correct size and had everything it was supposed to. I miss good customer service because many places don't have good service anymore unless you're tipping.</text><Response>None</Response>< time>

I went in looking for something very specific. The kind of utensils that someone would either take camping with them or carry around in a bag if they didn't want to waste plastic. Several people greeted me and inquired what I was looking for but not in a pushy way and I ended up finding two choices within my budget. The recipient of my gift is going to be extremely happy because this is exactly what they were looking for. My backup plan was to go to the surplus store but in the end I didn't need to. I doubt I would have found a better deal there.< /review>

<time>1559932310794< /time><user>111478460087738011720< /user><text>Unfortunately, this store lost my business today. After being in traffic for about 2 hours I stopped by to get an Easy Up shade on sale and asked to use the restroom. The Millennial behind the desk said, "We don't have one in the building." I asked her if it was credible that she works an entire shift without using the restroom and she said she did. Now don't get me wrong, she could have said we dont have a public restroom, there is one available next door, etc.... I could be mistaken but she appeared to be making a bold faced lie. $20 off a Easy Up shade is not worth the indignity of being denied a basic human function with a lie. The 7-11 down the street treated me with hospitality and got my business for the day.<//text></record></dataset><record>

There is a great selection of sporting goods on two floors, plus the always fitting room; only one at this location and it's not private.

The store has 1 or two parking spots in the back and a few in the front, so it's not really too good to drive there or you need to like to walk.<//Text>

I love my local Big 5! The store is always well supplied and the employees / managers are really helpful. I can always find great deals / value, and the customer service is outstanding!

I was in the store recently when a local studio tried to return hundreds of dollars of merchandise they had clearly used for a photo shoot, and even under immense pressure, the management team tactfully handled the disgruntled (scheming) "customers" while simultaneously managing a store full of other customers taking notice of the commotion. Great sporting goods store and prices are very reasonable!<//text>

I visited this location on a Wednesday at 4pm and it was very busy. I had to wait over 10 minutes to get someone to help me. Once an employee helped me he was really friendly and knowledgeable. They have great soccer equipment deals. A bit congested though.<//text>

Drove to this location 40 min away from my home to purchase a canopy only available at this location. I called before going some lady told me it was in stock. When I get there, some African American lady in the from so rude and lazy didn't want to help me find the item. This other guy started helping me and turns out they did not have my item. Wasted gas and time coming to this place.</review>

<Review>The sales people are nice, but this location is awful. Hardly any room to move around. Needs more square footage. I felt claustrophobic in there. Boxes blocking the stairway, clothes racks only a foot apart. Parking is horrible. They have 2 handicapped parking the the back and maybe 5 tight spots behind the building. I won’t go back.< /Review>< rate>

Very friendly and helpful staff. Cheap prices. Everything goes on sale at some point, so if what you want isn't on sale, just wait a couple weeks! You can even ask them if something will be going on sale soon. Sometimes they'll even give you a discount that has already passed!< /Text>

This place is fine if you need something quick.  This place is convenient that way. The parking is virtually non existent with only a few spots in the back.  You only have staff at the register, therefore don't expect help.  It's always odd to see guns being sold, but I suppose you'd come here if there ever was a zombie apocalypse.<//Text>

<Review>Cool I bought some weight lifting gloves from here this particular location has been there for a while I just wish the place didn't look so cluttered it almost seems as if they got too much stuff I dont know but there's a paystation for parking on the street not sure if you have to pay on weekends I'm assuming you do but don't quote me on that I parked in the back of the store there's about 7 to 8 spaces and 2 handicap at night tho I wouldn't park because there's a alley along the way I gave it three stars because the store looks messy and the parking lot in back could use some touching up other than that I'm good.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>If you are looking for good service then don't dare to come here...Just walked out of this store and I will never return. I came to return a pair of shoes that came messed up ..first of all no anyone is trained to do returns, they need a managers approval (whatever)...The associate kept calling the manager thru the mic and the manager no where to be found....Then they asked Dorian? If he could do a return..this lazy idiot, is rolling his eyes and thinking about it (like really? And then these type of idiots wonder why they don't have a job and live off food stamps)...Anyways, after giving it a thought the idiot came to do the hard work of just putting in a passcode on the computer for this rude mexican to get her attitude at me since she saw I was getting mad....Overall so rude and I am sooo mad, that tomorrow first thing in the morning I will be calling corporate. If I could give 0 stars I would definetly do it.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

VERY long story short, a transition (using a coupon) that was small ended up with a very salty and nasty attitude for the manager and sales girl there! While I was there, another man had a coupon (it was torn but the part with the barcode was still in tact) and the manager made yet another UNnecessary comment....the young ladies who work there PROBABLY have never been on Unemployment!

Bottomline, in 2010 with the economy being what it is and people losing their jobs, you'd ASSUME a major chain like Big 5 would want "repeat business".....NOT THE CASE IN CULVER CITY!

Drive the extra few miles to ANYwhere else (Target, Walmart, Sports Chalet, etc....) for your sporting needs....!

I WILL NOT RETURN THERE!<//text>
