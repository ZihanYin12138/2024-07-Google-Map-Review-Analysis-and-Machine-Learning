Was happy to find this local business! I visited this cute cupcake shop today to get cupcakes as a birthday gift, and pick up a couple extra while I was there. I tried the lemon blueberry, and that's what made me write this review. OMG so good! A lemon cupcake and with blueberry frosting, right? No. It has a surprising layer of tart but sweet (but pretty tart!) lemon glaze in between the sweet, but not too sweet, blueberry frosting.and cupcake. Delicious! Will be going back for sure.</text>

Absolutely delicious, the shop is in Alice in Wonderland Theme. I loved it. I had the Lemon Lavender cupcake and I was amazed. Absolutely delicious. 10/10 would eat again.<//text>

<Review>This place has a charm that is so fun and authentic. The moment you walk in you feel like you have entered a world of wonder. This is a great place to bring kids. The cupcakes are of superb quality, I tried the Dutch apple cupcake and it was delicious.  The man behind the counter was so kind and friendly. It makes you feel good about spending money at small businesses.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I just purchased two gluten free cupcakes tonight as a treat for my wife’s birthday. From past experience, at other bakeries, I made sure to ask if they were fresh, and was told that they are made fresh daily.  I was so excited to bring them home to her. Unfortunately these cupcakes were terrible, and after tasting them, had to toss them both in the trash. Even the frosting (which should be naturally gluten free) tasted terrible and had a chemical taste about it. I don’t know if we just got a bad batch or if this is what to expect with all their gluten free cupcakes, but we won’t be going back for more.
Dissatisfied and disappointed.<//Text>

I highly recommend the Fauxstess cupcake, it has a yummy marshmallow cream filling that tastes way better than hostess cupcakes do. I like the roomy, yet cozy environment with tables to read and work on.</Text>

The gluten free cupcake was chocolate with a raspberry frosting. Normally I would not enjoy chocolate with berry, but this was an Awesome cupcake- it was moist and soft, and tasted more like a brownie, and the frosting was a deep rich flavor. It was so rich I actually had to eat it in two separate sittings. My daughter enjoyed the cake pop. The was also a pumpkin cookie available gluten free.
The atmosphere was eclectic and fun almost like Alice in wonderland. Whimsical and creativity inspiring. It was an enjoyable visit.</Review>

<text>This is a really cute cupcakery, and you can tell they have a lot of pride in baking their cupcakes right there. My only complaint is that the cupcake was a little dense, and I wasn't sure if this was due to it having been frozen prior to me eating it or if it was just a dense batter, but it seemed a few days old. Overall, the flavor was on point!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dcb1faa205fe23:0x4831e2f0bf6c696f</GmapID></record>

<Time>1520987933174< /Time><Text>Downtown Riversides hidden gem!!! Stopped by this wonderful shop while shopping at the farmers market. I expected a nice cupcake but what I received was an outstandingly wonderful cupcake!! We ordered a lemon cupcake and a  red velvet.
The Lemon was wonderfully light and moist and full of sunshine kissed lemon flavor. The  red velvet was equally as light and moist with wonderful melt in your mouth chocolate flavor. The frosting was neither to dense nor to light, it's flavor perfectly complimented both cupcakes. Be sure to stop by Cupcakes and Curiosities on your next trip to downtown riverside.</Text><user_id>109949356343810604019< /user_id>< pictures>

< Review>
Best cupcakes in Riverside. We do cupcakes for birthdays at our office and this has been our go-to place for over a year. Always moist and the flavors are always tasty. Emphasis on moist as some neighbor competitors may look pretty but are dry! If you’re driving by you might miss it. It’s off the main sidewalk.< /Review>

Absolutely amazing cupcakes. We came from Denver and stopped in after the sandwich shop. I had the German chocolate. Omg amazing!!! So we stopped back in before our trip back home and
took cupcakes to go. S’mores amazing, cookies and cream my absolute favorite, German chocolate ( my family made me share) and I didn’t want to.  I can’t wait to go back.< /Review>

<text>I love how curious it is.  My children could have been there for hours. They have books you can read (please eat the food away from the books) and a million different interesting things for small children. The worst part about it was my kids wanted to touch everything and not everything is steady enough for a 3 and 5-year-old.  But they have the best cupcakes I've found around so far.  I'll be going back again</text>< date>

<review>I absolutely love sweets. I love all things sweets.  So today I decided to go into Something Sweet to try it.  I dragged my co worker along with me. When we first walked in we seen Sirena in the back whipping up something delicious.  She was very friendly and answered all our questions. I decided to go with the Red Velvet.  I loved the flower on the top of cupcake.  The cupcake wasn't to sweet, it wasn't to bland,  it was just right.  I remember her telling us that she makes them from scratch. This cupcake was worth the 3.50! I will be going back.<//review>< Pictures>

Serina's cupcakes are absolutely wonderful!  This is the one place that my husband (an avid baker) wanted to order cupcakes from for his birthday, and we were very pleased!  We had asked Serina to create a maple cupcake, and she surpassed our expectations!  No bells and whistles necessary to impress - the cake and the frosting are exceptional, and Serina is friendly and accomodating.  Tucked inside the building behind The Upper Crust (another excellent lunch place!) on Main Street, Something Sweet by Serina qualifies as a hidden gem worth finding!</Text>

When you see Casey's Cupcakes, KEEP WALKING until you get here. You will not be disappointed! Try the cinnamon cupcake with coffee buttercream. So delish!</review>

The espresso cupcake didn't hit the sweet spot and my craving was left unsatisfied. Very friendly staff and clean little shop! I'd come again and try other sweets.<//Review>

Traveling thru King City and stopped for lunch. Quaint outdoor seating in downtown. We had the carne asada tacos and the chicken enchiladas-awesome! Chips and salsa were great and made fresh. Wine selection and pour were amazing! Kudos to Guadalajara for continuing to serve great food and drink during these challenging times! Thank you!< /text>

------------------------
UPDATE 8/29/17:
Arrived again on 8/12/17 for our Camarones a la Diabla. 5 guys ordered it and all 5 pronounced it as the best they have eaten yet anywhere. Don't know what other reviewers are eating but make no mistake - there is NOTHING bland about the Camarones and it IS authentic. Try it and let me know what you think. Or, don't and we'll have more for us, lol!
------------------------------------------

We have been using this establishment for going on 15 years now. It is a lunch destination spot for our little motorcycle group, and we go for one thing and one thing only - Camarones a la Diabla. It is consistently the best we've ever found + they own the tortilla factory next store so those are fresh as can be as well. Sublime heat and flavor combo. Somebody said this place was flavorless? LOL! But don't listen to me, go taste for yourself. I'm headed there tomorrow and can't wait, maybe I'll see you there.
PS: They appear to be open Sundays now but I also hear that they close one Sunday a month so take note.< /text>

Good food, pretty good service. We asked for extra napkins right away but never got extra napkins. It would have been nice if they had a changing table for the baby, but alas, no changing table for the weary travelers.</Review>

The food is pretty but you can find better elsewhere in town. Their salsa is their winning item. Service is inconsistent; sometimes great and sometimes sub par. The restaurant can be close to empty and you still wait a long time for food sometimes. It’s good for once in a while but you can eat for less elsewhere and usually enjoy the food more too.< /Review>

Good food but wait staff were chatting and didn't bring the bill. We tried to eat there last month and they were unexpectedly closed during their posted normal business hours with no explanation. Restaurant is clean and decor is pleasant. Will try them again if we're in King City.<//Text>

Delicious! I haven't had such good Mexican food in years. The flautas were extra crispy and hot. The chips and salsa were so fresh and yummy. The guacamole made my eyes roll back into my head out was so good. Honestly, it was a memorable meal!<//Review>

It was ok for boiled meat with no seasoning.   If I wanted bland Mexican food I would have stayed in WA state.   The wait staff is very friendly.</Text>

Of all the local Mexican restaurants in King City, CA this one is the best. Make sure to ask for the real salsa that they keep in the back to avoid wasting your time with the watered down tomato sauce half the locals think tastes good.</review>

Where to start... Service is non existent... Asked for the entree flautas and got one on the side (no rice or beans, etc)... Selection and food is bland and basic... Chips are good, but the salsa is bland and flavorless... There are other "street taco" options just a couple doors down... Keep walking... You'll thank me later...<//review>

Worst customer service. Ordered our food and it took 15 minutes for them to come back and say that they ran out of my plate. Then they come back with a plate that is not even what we ordered. Pollo and camaron do not even begin with the same letter. So my mother had to wait much longer while watching us eat. My dad couldn't enjoy one bite of his carne asada because it all had fat everywhere. Worst of all they bring my brothers burger without the patty. Who forgets the patty on a burger? These waitresses need to be more attentive to their customers and need to be more aware of what they need. No spoon for the coffee. No napkins. No utensils. With the type of experience we had, we should have eaten at the taco place in the corner.<//Text>

Everything I ordered was very salty and the beans tasted like Rosaritas canned refried beans.  If I'm going to pay to eat out, I expect freshness, and they should really taste the food before hand to make sure it's not too salty! Seriously left a full plate.<//Review>

Place is large, good for small groups,  friendly staff.
Food was bad though. It was bland. One of the worse Mexican food I've had in California.< /Text>

<Review>Advertised price per gallon for diesel was 3.78 per gallonon May 24, 2021, as noted on their billboard. I paid at the pump with a debit card and spoke with the manager to correct the price. The manager told me to wait until after I pumped and to push the debit button, but there wasn't one. I went back into the store to remedy the problem, and she said it rung it up as credit and there was nothing she could do about it. I told her they were not advertising the right price and it's a shame they lost my business forever for a mere $2.50.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMujcZLnNPznz0pTt9OnST40TnMGUYW_FDQy9UQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Bathroom was filthy, and though there was a sign stating that masks were required to get service, I saw three people without them. I decided not to buy gas after all.<//review>

Functional. staff were wearing masks, covid-19 compliant.

Don't be tricked by the gas prices. Arco is cheaper.

This place looks like something you would findin a horror movie on a long deserted stretch of highway. It's old and run down.

But as I opened, it is functional. I got gas and I got twizzlers and I used a restroom.<//Text>

<Review>Three stars because of the discounted gas price, if you pay with cash or debit, and the easy access from the highway. Lose two stars because the display on one of the pumps is broken, the working displays show the higher credit card price (+0.08 per gallon) until after the transaction is almost over, at which point you are actually charged the lower price, and one of the restrooms was out of order when I visited.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

There's no signs that would let you know truck parking is $10 dollars for 12 hours. Is a very small truck stop with maybe 6 spaces to park ( not parking lots). There's a fried chicken place inside the store. Store is open 24/7.< /text>

The bar area is nice. They have mainly high top tables If you are ok with that. Friendly service.</Review>

Bad place to watch a main event. Understaffed, no room to sit and no parking. Food took more than an hour to come out. Ordered before the main event and got the food after the fight. Also got charged twice for a bucket of beer. No security to stop a fight right at the entrance of the restaurant.</Text>

Short staffed during UFC 232, so service was very slow. Wasn't like this when they were the previous restaurant. Great atmosphere over all and great food. I will be back in the future.</review>

Finally had some time to stop by. Nice spot with some nice memorabilia. Great service. Jullysa was a fantastic bar tender! Just had Alfredo "El Perro" Angulo train for his fight against Sergio "The Snake" Mora. Would have been nice to bring him and his wife over for lunch.< /text>

< Review>
Had to see what the fuss has been about their spicy chicken sandwich. I've tested spicy chicken sandwiches everywhere and  it ranks in the top three of the major food chains. The portion is large. The pickles are fresh and crispy, not sour. The hot sauce in the sandwich on its own was pleasant, but with a serving of their side hot sauce, it was popping. I believe others have given this original spicy chicken sandwich a run for its money, but it still stands.< /Review>

Arrived around 7:15pm. It was a 15mins crawl along the drive-thru lane. The crew was kind enough to grant more chicken thighs in my 8-piece order.< /Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1621693610450</date><Review>I’ve been to this popeyes a few times and had the same experience you usually get at a Popeyes but this day that i specifically went, and for me specifically, not saying that it happens to everyone, the workers were very nice, friendly, and thoughtful. They offered me a beverage for the long wait time and i had a friendly conversation with a couple workers. My order was also correct and hot’n’ready. A big downside which is at most Popeyes i’ve been to is why the heck do they ask me what sauce i want when i order and then ask me again when i receive my food, BUT i only get the sauces i ask for when i receive my food, not when i was ordering. It’s like i have to reorder my sauces. Why even ask what sauces i want when i order if you’re going to ask me again when i get my food and only give me what i want the second time. K hope that makes sense.</Review>< Response>

<text>Bad customer service . Rude people. Have no manner. Worse than a kid. The woman yelled at me at the drive through. When I arrived at the window they asked me to go to the front door which is facing the street. I had to  cross a street to the middle lane and turned around again to the parking which is on the side of the front door. Then I had to go back to the drive through again. I clearly ordered drive through not inside store. They need to go to kindergarten or elementary to learn their basic human being manner. The women there had no manner no customer service whatsoever.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Worst Popeyes ever! You think 3rd times a charm, nope. Have people waiting in the drive thru line just to tell them they ran out of their sandwiches. And on top of that no way to just leave so now waiting in the drive thru for 10 minutes for no reason.< /text>< Pics>

Who knows chicken? My neighbor, but I moved. Their worst meal is better than the others best meal. Come on people try it! Look get a meal and add an apple pie if you don't think it's at least as good as your last chicken meal the pie will change your mind!😄😄</Review>

I came to this location ordered a kids meal, gave me something I didn’t order so I told the employee & she went to the manager to fix the issue. I let that go, second time I come it took them a while to take my order, missed something I ordered, portions were small & biscuits were cold. The employee had attitude when I asked for the missing item. Definitely won’t be returning, not only is their customer service bad they don’t take that extra 2 seconds to double check the orders. The amount of time they have you wait you’d think they’re doing everything correctly, unfortunately that’s not the case. Bad location.</text>

I've had multiple issues over the course of multiple visits at this location. With lack of drinks, being told that certain drinks are being offered, then asking for what is available and being told that Coke and Sprite were available, and being told we don't have Coke or Sprite after I asked one after the other. I then asked what do you have available and then being asked again what drink I wanted at the window.

I can overlook not being given condiments. My latest issue, I placed an order through Doordash and once again items are missing, my drink and condiments. The staff looks like high-school students and they look like they are more interested in socializing than working.

I had hope for this restaurant because the other Popeyes in Riverside wasn't good, but comparing the 2, this one is far worse.<//review>

If you get here and see more then two cars just go somewhere else.<//text><Date>1608598894652</Date>< response>

Someone needs to retrain all these kids working at this location. I'm pretty sure I got old food, that had ben fried a couple times over. I observed a manager, under age 25 for sure, without gloves, Amid this pandemic. Our chicken sandwich was cold and smooshed Fries were also cold.< /review>

Dear management, I’m not typically a low rating reviewer but this moment today(7/12/2020) at 1:30PM has given me a reason to do so. I can understand when an item sells out and hold no ill will towards that in any way but what I didn’t appreciate was that your drive-thru employee had enough gall to leave her speaker on and talk negatively regarding my order by saying “Then why come to Popeyes?!” due to there being a lack in blackened chicken and me kindly refusing any other option as my dietary restriction will not allow breading of any sort I’m just disappointed in the service I would say. I do hope you speak with the young lady who made that remark as there’s no harm in teaching people manners. I appreciate your time in reading this, thank you.</Text>

Today 7/30/20, I had probably the worse service ever.
I had to wait to order by the speaker for about 10 minutes and didn’t apologize when they called. Then, at the drive through they had an attitude. They said have a “great day“ with an attitude when they gave us our food but they didn’t even give us our drinks. We waited there until they realized. Then, they tell us that they ran out of coke. Wow. All late. After they gave us our drinks they slammed the window and didn’t say “have a great day”. When I arrived home, the fries were thrown around and gave us ranch like if it’s coming out of their pay check. Step it up...< /text>

I’ve never left a bad review before but this really deserves it. The girl behind the counter was extremely rude to us and other customers and her manager was right next to her. Honestly the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Then they forgot a whole meal from our order. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.</Review>

I am very disappointed. In this location, there service is so bad its unbelievable. I have ordered from the drive through 5 times now and guess how many times my order has been messed up? ..... 5 out 5, missing items, incorrect items. Quality has been 50/50
The worst part of it all, is there is no working telephone number to call and get the issues fixed or get any kind of help what so ever.< /review>

Very rude employees, I ordered a number 9 with mashed potatoes and a Dr pepper and it took them 6 tries to figure out what I wanted. They were joking with their co-workers in the background and would ask me to repeat myself because they were having a conversation with someone else. Drive thru line took 20+ minutes to get through as well. I don't think I will ever come back to this place.< /Text>

I don’t ever leave reviews. This Popeyes has messed up my order 6 times. I always have missing items and when I call the phone number apparently doesn’t work. I don’t know if the people who pack the food are just not paying attention to the orders or just being lazy.</review>

My husband and I were very excited about this Popeye's opening closer to us. I went there one night when it was busy and it was great service, my food was all hot when I got it. However, today I went there and waited for over an hour! Our fries were ALL cold when we received our order after having been told to wait for our food in the parking lot instead of the drive-thru. I have tried to call their number and it tells me it has been disconnected. I do not know any other way to put a review or complaint. I wasn't even given a receipt or asked if I want one. Very frustrated with them right now.</Text>

<Review>Biscuits was hard and cold.They gave us the part of chicken they wanted too (which we discovered after we got home). It was suppose to be mixed and they gave 5 thighs and they were cold. NEVER again! I will travel to San Bernardino, and in Rialto where I never had a issue and the food is better. Its bad when you have to leave to find decent food. There are two Popeyes; one on magnolia, and the this one on Arlington..they both have issues.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I’ve been to this location twice,  and I understand that it’s new location that had to open up during this pandemic, but both times that I’ve come they’ve messed up my order, and forgot half of it. They take forever to take your order over the drive thru speaker, and there is no phone number to call them to get your order fix. Once I got home, all food was cold, Mac and cheese looked like it was three days old, and chicken tenders were so hard! I think I will skip out on coming to this location and just drive five minutes more and go to the magnolia location.< /Text>< pics>

Would not even give this place a star if I could. Worst customer service I have came across in my life. Not only that but I drove back to work on my lunch break to  try and eat a very hard sandwich. I was looking forward to eating my lunch but my chicken sandwich is so hard I could throw it at the wall. Won’t come back again.</Review>

<Review>Poor service with an attitude. This is thee worst popeye's I've ever been to. My wife purchased a 2 piece meal, 3 chicken sandwiches and a drink. She got home after sitting in the line for over 45 minutes and we were missing 2 of the chicken sandwiches. I, personally, drove back and walked up to the window (due to the closure of the dining room for pandemic) and spoke to Rebecca. I provided the original receipt that was given to my wife with the purchase to the manager and she wouldn't even look at it. She stated that the receipt was the credit card receipt and could not accept it (even though the date, time and full purchase was on receipt). She refused to provide me with missing items and told me to call a 877 phone number to complain. At that point I had already lost my💩 and told her that I would file a complaint with the corporate office. I understand that this restaurant barely opened about a week ago, but being that they are new to the community, you would think that they would want to provide better service during this time. I do not recommended this restaurant due to the unprofessional way that the manager personally spoke to me, and was not willing to make the situation right. Her name was Rebecca and I want people to know who she is.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>We've only been there twice and they messed our order three times. We had to go back twice and when we told them they messed up the order again and showed them the receipt the manager said "are you sure." We went home and had to go all the way back. We order a 16 piece and 8 biscuits and instead they gave us one small and one large chicken tenders. Very disappointed we were waiting for this one to open and had high hopes.< /Review><Date>1591286345119<//Date><user_id>118332782049619540661</user_id><username>angelo mogart</username></record></dataset><record>

This park is huge!The park has lost of open room and things to see throught out. Be warned the parking garage is a total ripoff!! I ended up spending $33 for parking.In the morning hours independent artists setup their work and try to sell it publicly. Some were out there making new art on the spot. People were doing yoga in the main park. I'm not sure if there is live music everyday but when I was in the main area an orchestra was playing.<//Text>

Labor Day weekend in Coral Gambles and decided to walk around the city to check out the non-star sites. Beautiful sized park with many activities going on. You saw the young 50+ and children with parents and pets strolling all over. Nice place to sit down with a book on a good day.<//Text>

<review>It's not that the park itself is bad, it's just in a really bad area. There are lots of homeless walking around yelling mindlessly, as it's right off Hollywood Blvd. It feels like a bad area, somewhere I wouldn't let my kids go alone.</review><pics>None< /pics><Time>1490981132106< /Time>< name>

Well, my Tire Pressure light came on while driving on the 405. I stopped here since it was the closest place. The assistant at the time, Trevor, was really friendly and helpful. He checked all 4 tires, added some air, and even replaced a couple of the valve caps that were missing at no cost. If I lived nearby, I would definitely go back to this place due to its great customer service.< /review>

'My car would over heat and I was told that my radiator was cracked which I couldn't afford so I kept driving on it. Took it to another shop to get the oil changed and I was told it was overheating because I had no coolant and there was absolutely no crack in sight and there was air in the container it's been a few months and hasn't over heated yet. Good service and people but they will never get my money. I spent $900 getting my car fixed a few months ago and I wonder if even needed half that stuff now.< /Review>< resp>

Second nail in a tire in less than two months, previous place wouldn't fix it and sold me a new tire. This place repaired it for free! Guess where I'm going to get oil change or new tires next time!? Also, it's right next to the big Westfield mall, so you got something to do while you wait.
Next time I'm going shopping there I might as well have them look at my truck!< /Review>

WAITED 2 HOURS 30 MINS for a patch up😖 and when I first came in no one was in the front desk so waited to be attended for about 20 mins. RIDICULOUS WAIT TIME!!! IF U WANT FAST SERVICE THIS IS NOT THE PLACE!< /Text>

I can say only but thanks..

I had my break fixed somewhere else, and forgot to ask for a oil change , well decided to go to this business and asked for the oil change,

then the technician came to me telling me that the breaks work was not not properly done  and that the breaks could have been failed if I entered into the freeway..

That was a surprise, this people at this place saved my life.. and of my family...

You got a loyal costumer with me and my family and also friends cuz I will recommend this place to them surely..< /review>

This place is awful
They said it will take 2 hours to repair my tier and when I came after 2 hours and half they told me it is not ready yet, guess what!! They didn't start even..and when I asked the guy why? He said I told about 2 hours and he was so rude and the surprise that his manager was rude too. Lol
The problem is when they got the car on the track and started to fix it guess what!!! It's not repairable lol..it's not that only they don't have the tire lol
This place is a big meSS
I WISH MY COMMENT REACH ONE OF THESE MANAGERS UP THERE
thank you<//Text>

After an oil change, they gave me a laundry list of repairs "I needed". New brakes, rotors, waterpump, shocks, etc. The noise I complained about (which they couldn't hear) when I accelerated was attributed to the water pump. (huh?) I went home to research online and found out they are NOT to be trusted.

Months later I went to a near by Goodyear. I got the oil changed, I told them about the noise. I asked them for a brake inspection and an inspection of the water pump and shocks. An hour later, brakes have plenty of life, one shock has tiny leak and can wait, water pump is perfect and the noise they narrowed down to a transmission problem. They referred me to a Dodge dealership since I was still under warranty.<//review>

NO WIFI!? How do you have a waiting room these days that does NOT have wifi for customers?!

Also, the woman at the counter was curt and not very friendly.

I won't be coming back to this location - there are plenty of other locations nearby.< /Text>

Food is delicious and all vegan, except where noted, and then it's vegetarian.  They put most food in  compostable containers and have the most delicious mini sesame seed balls.</review>

All of the items are listed as things such as “Mongolian beef” but it’s all 100% vegan. I actually like their sesame chicken better than regular kinds as this is crispy and flavorful, and doesn’t have veins like real chicken sometimes has. You have to try this place!!

<Name>Christine Mamuad</Name><Text>Love love love the food at Enjoy! I am not a vegetarian, but I do like vegetarian food, especially at outstanding Chinese places that rival their omnivorous counterparts in flavor. Appetizers here are excellent: the drumsticks and fried tofu are our favorites, but the sticky rice was surprisingly good too. We have tried a few of the entrées and enjoyed them all, in particular the lamb, tofu, and pumpkin in satay sauce, and we are looking forward to trying even more off the menu.</Text>< time>

I don't usually like sushi and I was skeptical, but this was great sushi and they have more than just sushi. Can't believe I missed out on this for all these years of living here. Not only was the food tasty, but also creative and entertains! I loved the surprise virgin cocktail soda!< /text>

Great vegan sushi that doesn't taste like vegan sushi! Both my omnivore friend and I loved it! Parking is tough and the wait is long, highly suggest using the wait list to avoid and hour long wait. It is a very popular restaurant so we didn't mind the wait, they work fast to get you seated.</Review>

< Review>
The sweet and sour chicken is amazing. All the dishes are cruelty free. And the staff are super helpful and friendly. We came at the end of lunchtime with a party of 6 and they happily accommodated us. Then the waitress helped us figure out how much we all owed. When the amount of cash we had was more than the bill (which included 18% gratuity) she attempted to give the "extra" tip back to us, which we insisted she keep. Will definitely be going back and bringing friends and family!< /Review>

One of my fave vegan spots in the US.  Thankfully my wife and I can enjoy it here in Houston.  They have amazing spring rolls (both fresh and golden).  The rest of their meals are great too.</text>

Great choice of vegetarian foods. We tried basil eggplant, pumpkin curry and twice cook pork. Everything was very tasty with curry being my favorite. The service was fast and plenty of seating space.</text>

Had mixed experiences here. I like some of their rolls namely the peacock and their soup, though once it was a mushy mess, I'm willing to go back.

The service here is really outstanding and so is the ambiance. Worth a try.

It is pricy and don't try to show up ten minutes before closing or you'll get turned away.<//review>

< review>
Just off China town, this is a great place for vegans, vegetarians and curious omnivores. If you want to show your omnivore friends how meat substitutes taste like, this is the place.
We tried the pork, chicken and beef meals on 2 different occasions, the beef and chicken were very tasty. Beef with daikon and chicken with basil are personal favourites.

The place is quiet, food comes fast, no queues. Service might be a tad forgetful but in general friendly.

Definitely worth a visit!</review>

<text>Good place for vegetarians. They have a lot of varieties to cover the menu.

I went there twice. First time I ordered friend spring rolls, spicy mapo tofu and house chow mean. Spring rolls were not that good, but, other two things were good (4 star out of 5).

What amazed me is the "spinach & cashew fried rice" which I ordered the second time I went there. I absolutely loved it and will definitely go back for it.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPovBCvn5_ujaZ2sgf5kMp4zpLnxQTudP6IiIl3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808580f4cebdb06f:0xd3af09e5742234f2<//GmapID></record>

<review>Tried Enjoy Vegetarian this past week for the first time. Taste was good, decent options. Reminded us a bit of a restaurant in LA called Happy Family, but one big difference is the value for the cost. NOT for large groups. Eight of us went, of whom four were kids and left not even close to full. Very small portion sizes. We spent $120 and basically had saucer size sample plates. Would have had to spend triple to be full. Ridiculous. Most of it is only veggies so not sure why there are not larger portions or all you can eat like the place in LA. Would be willing to pay a bit more for all you can eat. Might be ok with a smaller group like 2 or 3. If not, save your money and go somewhere where you get more bang for your buck.</review>< pictures>

<text>After searching vegetarian food on a busy Monday - I found this place in Chinatown (located easily though). Didn’t had to wait for my order, but mind you guys the restaurant name & menu items don’t match. The name of restaurant is Enjoy Vegetarian- a complete veg restaurant but when you see the menu it has hell lot of meat dishes being served - I literally got confused. I tried steamed dumplings which I didn’t like much - they were actually flavorless! I tried string beans - same feeling. Try at your own risk fellas!</text>< pictures>

Huge vegetarian selection with a pretty good imitation of meat textures. I had Mongolian beef and house chow mein with faux pork. I liked both, but thought they could improve their flavoring of both. Maybe next time I will request they make it spicier. Great texture, kind of average flavor wise. I was promptly seated and served. I will return and would recommend.</text>

They included two free fried egg rolls as an appetizer. And tea.

I had what I think is the 1st item on the lunch menu:
tofu, pumpkin, and string beans in a black bean sauce

It was super yum!

The other dish was also very good, just not as special as this one. I am looking forward to trying more things on the menu, including the eggplant dishes.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>5< /Rate><Time>1563240311376<//Time></record>

We found this little gem during our first trip to San Francisco. We'd just flown in and wanted a quick bite, so we Yelped for something close to our hotel. We were delighted to find out Enjoy Vegetarian was Chinese food AND all vegetarian and vegan. We had spring rolls, spinach/pine nuts fried rice and vegetable Chow Mein noodles. All were flavorful and filling; the portions are huge, so be prepared to share or take some home. Service was prompt and helpful in answering questions.< /Text>

Super quick, and super tasty. Their fake meats are pretty damn close to the low-end meats you'd get at a similar fake-chinese food restaurant. Pop in and get your ethical gluttony on. Calories are all there, so it feels great going down your food hole.<//review>

<Review>This place is awesome! As a strict vegetarian, I sometimes struggle to find things I would like to eat in Chinese restaurants, but not here. I'm almost paralyzed by the amount of choices I have!

Went here with a begrudging omnivore who enjoyed the fake meat and had a change of heart after the meal! Can't wait to come back soon and try something new.<//Review>< rating>

Hidden gem of China Town for me, obviously lots of places to choose from but this stood out. Offering soya and tofu meat replacement dishes, food was good and served quickly be friendly smiley staff. Would recommend the lemon fillet, tasted just like fish, and the pine nut rice.</Text>

I have gone to this place after the span of 4 years. They offer good and wonderful vegan food at reasonable price. This eatery is perhaps the only vegan food place in Chinatown in Downtown San Francisco. Their food is not masked with strong pungent garlic and onion smell. One can enjoy the subtle spices and taste the vegetables. The servers and staff are happy to offer recommendation.

Enjoy the Enjoy Vegetarian!!< /Text>

<Review>My wife and I spent the day in Chinatown. We noticed this restaurant and decided to try it as my wife is experimenting with eating vegetarian. Even though I love meat, the meal that I was served was very delicious and very flavorful and very filling. My wife and I both enjoyed ourselves there thoroughly! We are definitely going to be going back to this restaurant again!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>I’ve gotten their pork, sea bass, and chicken dishes. They are all great vegetarian alternatives that stick with traditional Chinese flavors. Don’t believe any of these are possible until I try them. Spring rolls are also crunchy and yummy.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I would have given four and a half stars if I could. Finding a vegetarian Chinese restaurant with a menu full of dishes with mock meat was fantastic. There were so many good choices it was hard to choose.

The hot and sour soup was delicious. I enjoyed my entire meal.

The service was schizophrenic. The waitress who greeted me was very nice and I got a table immediately. The other wait staff was efficient but not friendly. My food came quickly and was piping hot. I just wish my soup came out before my entrée instead of at the same time.< /Text>

Healthy, filling food at reasonable prices. The vegetarian "meats" are soy products that absorb the sauces well. The menu is as extensive as you'd find in a non-vegetarian Chinese restaurant.  You can get standards like sweet and sour ""chicken" here, but can also try lotus root with lily and gingko nuts. Bonus points for offering brown rice, too.< /Review>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>The portions were generous for lunch, and all items are $10.99. Unfortunately, the quality of the food does not even compare to the price, especially for a vegetarian only place.

I ordered the spicy ma Po tofu and it was just cubes of tofu mixed with frozen carrots and green peas in a mixture of cornstarch and soy sauce. Couldn’t even find a single Sichuan peppercorn.

Don’t bother stopping by, unless you’re looking for a step down from Panda Express.< /review>< Pics>

Although menu items may seem to have meat, everything is made with meat alternatives. All but two menu items are vegan friendly as well. They also do not use onion or garlic in their food.

Really like their food.. serve a good amount. Was the first time trying their food and really enjoyed it. Definitely will be coming back to try more things. Alot of vegan options to choose from. At about the same price it would be at other Chinese restraunts that serve with meat. Healthier to eat 😋 and good</review>

Pretty good, the fried rice could have been more flavorful and the sticky rice dumpling was also under seasoned. The service was good and the basil soy chicken was great - the fresh basil leaves/deep fried soy chicken were amazing :) I’d come back but order more carefully.<//review>

<Review>This place is nice, I ate Kung Pao Chicken here. It would always be a delight to tell that I ate vegetarian chicken meal 😁.
The soupy gravy in the dish was really good, although you should go for smaller broccoli pieces, because it felt like I was eating that more instead of tofu

Great experience, keep it up guys!!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808580f4cebdb06f:0xd3af09e5742234f2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My vegetarian friend and I enjoyed the experience altogether. They offer a nice green tea as soon as you sit. A lot of choices. I ended up taking the twice cooked pork (tofu pork) and my friend ordered the eggplant. It was delicious. The prices are very good. You get a great value for what you pay. Recommended< /review>

Although I had to get my own menu and later the waitress gave me the wrong bill, the service was fast and the food was better than good. The plating could use refinement, as well as one of the chef's speciality appetizers needs rethinking. The food was tasty if not a bit less than stellar. Although the Buddhists don't cook with leeks, onions or garlic, I can only fantasize how much more interestingly tasty and complex these ingredients could vary this restaurant's many delicious dishes.</Review>

Did not "Enjoy" this bland vegetarian place. Flavors were off, faux meat was obviously old. Got two expensive entrees, neither was delicious OR filling. Service was quick but impersonal. Treat yourself... to another restaurant.</text>

Very good vegetarian restaurant near the Financial District. They use milk in their batter, which is too bad if you are vegan.

Apart from that, the food is always very tasty (the soy-chicken nuggets are delicious!), the service is very nice (they even remembered me after my first visit) and the prices are reasonable for the area.

Probably one of the best vegan/vegetarian option I know around there.<//text>

I was surprised how huge the vegetarian menu was. I really enjoyed my sweet and sour "chicken," and I can't wait to go back and try something else. It was affordable, clean and quiet. What more could you want!</text>

Excellent vegetarian dishes made in a traditional Chinese style with near authentic flavors. Some meat-style dishes were very meaty in texture and flavor. As a carnivore I was impressed and very much enjoyed my meal.< /Text>

Not bad as mock meat vegetarian Chinese restaurants go, but certainly not the best I've had. The vegetables were fresh and well cooked. Interestingly, the vegetable mix in one of my dishes was of much better quality than what was depicted in the picture on the menu. The sauces were good but a little bland.<//Text>

Delicious vegetarian food. The fake meat/fish closely mimic the the texture of actual meat/fish and was slightly easier to chew. Service was decent and attentive.</Text>

Great tea, great fake chicken and beef and lamb, their fried rice is to die for, and for those who like boba tea they share a location with their own tea place next door. Also nearby a lively park and the full atmosphere of Chinatown. A must see destination!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

All Soy based products here. No meat. I got the Sweet and Sour soy chicken and it was excellent! full of flavor and made me feel healthy eating it! Also tried the eggplant which was cooked to perfection and full of flavor (i'll be getting this next time). Can't wait to come back!

Fast Service and good lunch prices.<//text>

Not only that, but every meat lover I've brought here seems to love the food as much as I do! A lot of the dishes I've tried are simply mind-boggingly delicious. The owner recognizes me as a regular and has given me the occasional on-the-house dessert when I bring my friends. I know I'm not going to live in San Francisco forever, but this restaurant will definitely be in my memories. :)</Review>< rate>

Fake chicken, fake beef, etc. The portions are big, but a sweet and sour chicken doesn't come with rice for example. You have to buy a massive portion of rice which is almost the same price as the meal itself. No half portions possible. A bit disappointing.<//text>< username>

<Text>Both service and food were disappointing. We arrived and were seated almost immediately with menus, but after that, were ignored for 20 minutes, and had to get up to find our waitress. Once we did that she took our order very quickly, seeming annoyed, without saying hardly anything, did not ask us if we wanted anything to drink, or give time after we gave our food orders for us to even ask for water. We both ordered soups, and neither was very flavorful, had to add large amounts of soy sauce and chilly sauce before they tasted like much more than boiled noodles and veggies.< /Text>< rating>

<Review>Spicy kung pao "chicken" was good, but not amazing. I was there just before closing so they were in a bit of a rush to get rid of me and go home. I love having a pure veg (i think its vegan) restaurant here, but not sure i will go back...

There are so many good restaurants nearby that have tasty vegetarian / vegan options, but also do meat, so it depends on how you feel about mixed kitchens.<//Review>< Date>

<Review>Waited 40 minutes for a server that never came to take my order. I was the only black customer in restaurant and they kept walking past my table (they helped three different parties that came in after us. Including someone they sat RIGHT NEXT to us). Ended up leaving. Won't be back.< /Review>< gmapID>

Though the idea of providing meat-like tofu preparation in a veggie restaurant, the icy reception will surely make me hit another place the next time I come to visit Frisco</text>

<review>Had wan tan noodle soup, which was fair, but nothing to shout about. Complimentary tea for each table of customers.

Card payment is only allowed for bills of $10 or up (including tax). You will likely reach this minimum as each dosh woth tax is about $10 or more.</review>< pics>

If you do not want to eat meat, this place has many options.  Chow mein, fried rice, eggplant, mixed vegetable dish, egg rolls - all solid.

If you want meat, this is not the place for you.  :-(<//Text>

The texture of all the fake meat dishes was great, but I was sad they didn't use too many spices - left some of them rather bland.< /Text>

Best oyster spot in town. Great service great food they change the menu often. Which I think is great. The chef gets very creative here. Great beer selection tap and bottle. Place is clean and well decorated.
Ask for Damian great server.<//review>

<Review>I have been to this place twice, and will come back for more! For a small kitchen, they can bang out very beautiful and flavorful dishes! My favorite was the stuffed peppers and meat tacos? I forgot the name, but nonetheless, every dish I've tried with my friends and we enjoyed every single bite. Make sure you order the bread pudding, cause it is just delicious!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Fun atmosphere... There's few things that beat oysters & beer on a Friday night. The fish & chips wasn't bad either< /text>

Delicious, bomb food! I appreciate the owner and cook so much for their food service. When I love love food, I will smile as I am eating, and that I did exactly. Now about to try the ribs! If the tri tip sandwiches are bomb, imagine the ribs! Only bbq joint I go to.< /Review>

<Review>Best bar-b-que chicken, pulled pork and tri tip ever! And I been around since they invented fire. The sides and cornbread are also fantastic. It ain’t fast food so give them some time, call ahead, and you will be glad you did. Really affordable and really good guys to boot.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

The tri tip had more fat then I am used to, but the overall flavor was incredible. The barbecue sauce is AMAZING. I wish I could buy it in bulk. The Mac and cheese is nice and sweet. The Cole slaw was delicious as well. The man behind the counter clearly knows what he's doing. Will come back when the craving for bbq hits!<//Review>

<Review>A++!!!! This place is so good! Had a pulled pork sandwich, super juicy! And since we took it to go, he put the pork on side so my bread didnt get soggy! Bf had ribs which were huge and according to him phenomenal! The "small" sides are more than enough! Bomb cole slaw, baked beans, and amazing mac n cheese, toasted on top and creamy goodness! The nicest two guys you'll meet! We will def be back! Oh and super affordable too!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

So the other day I was in Selma at Nelsons power and smelled the BBQ from across the street. My girlfriend mentioned today how she wished California had more BBQ and then I remembered this place. We went in and we were not disappointed. Great prices and the amount of food you get is amazing, on top of the flavor. Beans were good and I loved the homemade potato salad. I would definitely recommend going here because I know it will definitely be a hard choice of what I'm gonna try next.< /Text>

The food is amazing.  This is the only BBQ that I will eat at in the Fresno area.  The meat is tender and is popping with flavor.  I cannot eat everything that is on my plate, because the portions are large.  The owner is very friendly and a joy to deal with.  If I had 3 thumbs, I would give it 3 thumbs up.

A BBQ place that doesn't have any BBQ SAUCE! Mac n cheese was runny. The cleanliness is not up to par. Kinda of disgusting.Then he forgot our corn bread. Didn't have no change. You need to get it together .  I will never go back ever.< /review>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Omg!!!! Amazing!!! This is such a tiny place with no indoor seating although there are a few outside tables . The meat is out of this world! Tri-tip is so flavorful.  The mac n cheese is totally on point and the beans are full of meat and spices. The owners are so nice and friendly. My only  complaint is that they are not closer to where we live! We would be there all the time if they were.< /text><name>mandy Kirby<//name><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

We waited and I have never been more satisfied before. We ordered 2 6oz tri-tip sandwiches. 1 was a meal with the mac and beans. And 2 cornbreads. And wow the meal almost killed me but it was so good I couldn't stop eating. This place deserves all the praise and then some! Great food, staff and overall quality.< /text></record>

<text>5 stars for the best Tri-Tip I have ever had. Not even Dog House Gill or Mike's Grill (both in Fresno) can beat it. I will come back and would be willing to drive from Fresno just to get some. The place is tiny so it looks a bit messy and there is almost no room to wait for your food, but since you can only pick-up it doesn't matter to me. I saw the cook outside and could smell the goodness as I approached from afar. Oh and the Mac and Cheese was uniquely amazing. Service was relatively quick specially since I called in my order, but I'm big on customer service so I would say they need to up there game and be a bit more relational with casual conversation  instead of just the "hi and bye" additude . Don't get me wrong, they seem really nice and they did wish me a good lunch but that was one thing I saw could use improvement, oh and maybe hire at least one other person because I only saw 2 people working. I would totally recommend this to anyone that loves meat! Hope this was helpful and I hope you enjoy it if you try it.< /text>< resp>

It was my absolute pleasure today to speak with a VP from Advantage Gold firm named Brandon Thor. This gentleman went way up and beyond in helping me with my investment in precious metals inquiry. Frankly, it was a genuinely terrific experience because businesses do not operate in this manner these days. Based on the information and education he provided me, I would not hesitate to call on Mr. Thor to be my representative in securing a large investment in metals to stave off the coming devaluation of our dollar and the inflation we'll all feel soon.
Please feel comfortable with dealing with this firm and this gentleman as he's a keeper! I highly recommend using Advantage Gold for your needs.<//Review>

I am a novice gold buyer/investor and had a myriad of questions before moving money from my Fidelity Traditional IRA into an Advantage Gold Self-Directed IRA to buy/invest in precious metals.  Matthew was an amazing resource for me and guided me through every step of the process.  His knowledge and superb market analysis helped me to make sense of our current stock market environment and the high volatility we are seeing with stocks in general.  I'm so glad that I decided to work with Advantage Gold so they could teach me the smarter way to invest my hard earned investment dollars.<//review>

I have been a customer of Advantage Gold for over three years. My experience with their team, and especially Andrew Jordan, has always been exceptional. I have been impressed by the efficiency and security of their ordering and shipping processes. Recently I made a wire transfer to AG on a Tuesday morning, and I had my PM purchase in hand by Friday of the same week. The team followed up to ensure my order could be tracked, and that it arrived to my satisfaction.
Highly recommended!<//Review>

A big shout out to Zach. He took the time to address all my questions ( and I had a lot) and find the answers that gave me the confidence to pull the trigger and invest in precious metals. After the initial decision, the process of picking and purchasing the metals was smooth as silk. I believe Advantage Gold found a nugget of their own with Zach.< /Review>

I have had a really wonderful experience working with Brandon Thor at Advantage Gold. Brandon really took his time with me and answered all of my questions thoroughly and with honesty. I knew ahead of time that this was the company I wanted to work with based on lots of excellent reviews and numerous websites that put this company in the top 10 and sometimes even the top 5. I spoke with a couple of other companies before speaking with Brandon at Advantage Gold… and Brandon and Advantage Gold completely blew away the competition! Brandon will take his time with you and it’s like he has no other better place to be which is certainly not how I felt with some of the others. He thoroughly explains things very well, knows his subject in depth, and helped me make some important decisions regarding rolling over my traditional IRA into PM’s, while at the same time being completely hands off and not the least little bit salesman like. I feel really good about the decisions I have made and about this company. Brandon and the company seem very high integrity to me and I’m not that easy to fool. I put Brandon through the paces and he really impressed me! Give them a call today. You’ll be really glad you did!<//text>

I wanted to learn all the basics about investing in precious metals, and contacted AG. I spoke with Brandon Thor which despite being the senior Vice President of the company took 45 min walking me through a thorough explanation on how investing in physical gold works. Needless to say I am a small fish so to take so much time with me was very much appreciated, and said a lot about who he is. I highly recommend both AG and Brandon Thor.< /Review>

<text>Advantage Gold is awesome. I am so thankful to Matt Gavn for explaining  how I can use my 401K to invest in gold and silver. He showed me how money from my previous job could be separated from my current 401K to split my investment. I feel like I'm supersizing my options to make my money work for me. Good job!</text>< GmapID>

I had such a hard time making the decision to get precious metal IRA.  For a long time, I was so intimidated and frightened from lack of knowledge. I finally decided to get in contact with George Bush again who I had a long conversation almost 6 months ago. I am glad he still remembered me.
George was very polite and listened to me patiently with respect.  Of course, he still is the same!  I always feel comfortable when I talk with him.   I sincerely appreciate the assistance with completing my portfolio.  I am very happy to come back to him.<//text>

<review>Thank you Advantage Gold for connecting me with your representative, Ben Stern..   He listened and quickly understood my desire to educate myself and a family member regarding gold investment during this chaotic time when the Fed is printing more money and borrowing more than is sensible to a reasonable person.  Ben provided reading material and references that are more eye-opening than I could have imagined.  Thank you!</review>< pics>

This was a terrific experience from start to finish. Brandon was very informative and to the point without the traditional fluff.I was able to get the information I needed in a low pressure way and also received education on many other facets of the retirement account system. I highly
Recommend their materials and presentations on gold.

<Text>I took plenty of time researching the investment into physical gold. The information provided by Advantage Gold and Adam Barrata was outstanding and incredibly helpful in my decision making process. David was extremely patient with me and helped with my education throughout the process and I never felt pressured to do anything that wasn’t the right fit for myself and my family. I’m truly thankful for everything David and Advantage Gold did for me and would recommend David and Advantage Gold to anyone looking into physical gold as an investment.</Text><time>1617224249526</time>< userid>

After many years of being concerned and dissatisfied with traditional equities investing, I knew I wanted to move into something better, but I was too intimidated by my lack of knowledge to proceed.  My wife introduced me to Marc Neal of Advantage Gold, who has done an outstanding job of educating us and giving us the confidence to move forward in investing in precious metals.  Marc has been consistently kind and patient with us and is very knowledgeable about this subject.  We have thoroughly enjoyed our experience and look forward to a safer financial future with Marc and Advantage Gold.

Three years ago I became interested in purchasing gold and silver bullion, largely as a hedge against inflation.  My only previous exposure was gold stock.  I actually made my first "bullion" purchases on three different internet sites. They all turned out to be fake silver eagles. Beautiful -but fake. Disreputable sellers are out there, with attractive pricing and merchandise waiting to take advantage of you.

I then learned how to tell  fake coins from real coins.  One has to know what to look for - but the tells are obvious. I even constructed a "silver coin slide"  tool made with high power magnets I purchased on "Amazon. The slide test results are amazing and definitive. The attached photo shows a beautiful fake silver eagle firmly stuck on my slide tool.

My lesson and advice is to only buy from a reliable seller.

Advantage Gold is such a reliable seller.

I have since bought both gold and silver bullion from Advantage Gold.
George Bush  of Advantage Gold made my first purchase simple and efficient. I used, and recommend  bank transfers.  My actual time at the bank is measured in minutes. My bullion arrived promptly and securely at my door and now resides at the bank.< /text>

<Review>If you're looking to make a precious metal purchase or rollover a traditional IRA to one with precious metals, James Harrold @ Advantage Gold is your guy!  I never write reviews but felt compelled since James was so helpful, kind, incredibly knowledgeable, awesomely efficient, and overall amazing to work with.  If you're looking to work with a company with a great reputation and someone who you can trust, look no further than James.< /Review>< pictures>

If I could give Ben Stern a 10 star review I gladly would.  He so deserves it!

I couldn’t have asked for a better advisor.  Ben is not only knowledgeable but also very patient and kind.

I am a new investor and was somewhat nervous about transferring money from my IRA for the purchase of precious metals.

Ben was there to help me every step of the way.

I often look forward to our phone calls - VIP treatment and a pleasant chat with a great friend.

Ben, thank from the bottom of my heart for being there for me and making my new investment adventures a lot of fun!< /review>

I've been very impressed with Travis, from Advantage Gold. Even through my hesitancy to make, what seemed like, a major shift to a precious metals-backed IRA, Travis was always patient and willing to talk me through all of the details, checking in as I weighed my options, but never pressuring me to make a decision.

After I made my decision, the follow up has been impeccable. Keeping me in the loop as to what is occurring and the timelines I should expect. I've already personally referred several people to him and would not hesitate to do so again.<//text>

<date>1615321094127<//date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>When I sold my home property in 2020, I received a large amount of cash.  It had been sitting in my personal bank account since November 2020.  I needed to make a decision about the wisest investment to make with what can potentially be my personal retirement fund completely self-directed and maximizing benefit to my financial future.  When I attended the webinar presented by Adam Baratta, I was motivated to invest a large sum into the precious metals with Advantage Gold.

I signed up to receive more information and was soon called by Ben at Advantage Gold.  He did an excellent job explaining how the investments worked and the process was very simple and easy to understand.  I felt like he genuinely cared to provide professional customer care. The orders were processed, and I received the tangible proof of my "nest egg" within a few days.  It's great to actually have my hands on my own assets at this time in our world of uncertainty.

I feel so empowered by making the choice to invest in precious metals with Advantage Gold.  I have already recommended 3 other persons to this outstanding company.  It's the wisest choice to make!

He went out of his way to make sure I understood all the details, and with this being my 1st looking into gold, I felt comfortable with his approach.

I have now had several conversations with their representative, Ben, and have found him to be trustworthy, knowledgeable and friendly. While any investment decision needs to be reviewed carefully, I have felt like Ben was a guide and mentor instead of being a pressuring "Sales Guy".

My experience has been excellent and I would recommend a conversation with the folks at Advantage Gold (and especially Ben) to anyone who asked me.< /Review>

Def the best company to go to when you want to get information about gold and silver. Spoke with Jay Hebert, he was very knowledgeable about the services and what to offer. I will definitely recommend him and Advantage Gold to friends and family. Thank you for your professionalism and insight.< /Text>

I was looking for a way to invest the money in my Traditional IRA in something other than the stock market. Advantage Gold provided the solution. I could buy tangible gold and silver and have it kept inexpensively at a depository...so no home safe needed. Advantage Gold made the process effortless, personally walking you through all the paperwork. And since this was an investment avenue I knew nothing about, the education and the tools they provided have been invaluable. The integrity and customer service of their staff has been impeccable.</Review>

<text>Retiring and moving my 401K to an IRA was a little (a lot) stressful but Richard and Brandon made the process so easy. They took all the time I needed to understand the details of investing in the precious metals market. Stephanie and Ashley were also very helpful and professional in processing all of my paperwork. I was able to purchase metals for a great price and am confident in my investment. Advantage Gold also has a guaranteed buy back when I am ready to sell. But the best part is the accessibility.

<text>Marc Neal has been very helpful and patient in assisting me in the setup of my self directed IRA.  Additionally he has assisted  me in learning the fundamentals of metals investments and setting a course for my continuing education. Many tools are available on the Advantage Gold website to advance my knowledge of the metals market.
Working with Advantage Gold has been a very good experience and I would highly recommend them as a professional, responsive and high quality company to my family and friends.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Please know how glad I am to have Jared  helping me.  He is open and real, and exhibits his informative help and genuine friendliness in the way he answers my questions and concerns even though I told him I'm not currently financially able to be his customer.  He represents his company beautifully, and when I'm ready wouldn't even consider doing business with anyone but him and his company.<//text>

The process was very easy and the IRA department helped me get the job done quickly.

I spoke with Cody at Advantage Gold. This was my first time researching gold IRA’s and after speaking with other firms, my conclusion is that Advantage Gold was hands down the best firm I spoke to. They encouraged questions and made sure I had a complete understanding of gold. Cody is a gold pro, operates ethically, heads up, anticipates and creatively puts together otherwise difficult transactions. I highly recommend working with this company and individual.< /Review>

Travis and Michael are the best guys to work with. I'm the Newbie, and they explained all I needed to know: How this Gold IRA  works;  What I can expect from Advantage Gold; What my responsibilities are; What form of metal Gold is available; How it's transported; Where it's kept;  My access;  even, how to navigate the web sites.  Knowledgeable and Professional all the way.  I couldn't be more satisfied.< /Text>

I really like working with Mark Huffman at Advantage Gold. It was thanks to Mark that I moved my IRA from the bank retirement account into precious metals by highlighting the advantages I would get by investing in precious metals. He took the time to explain and help me with my questions and concerns. Mark offers great customer service and is always willing to go the extra mile answering questions in great detail. I am glad that I went ahead with Advantage Gold and I highly recommend Mark Huffman at Advantage Gold.</review>

I couldn’t be happier with Advantage Gold and my broker Michael Smollins. Michael was very patient and knowledgeable, he made the whole process easy and trouble-free. Highly recommend this company and Michael if you want to roll over your ira into gold and silver.< /review>

<Text>It was a pleasure working with Jared F at Advantage Gold. Being newly single, I wouldn’t be the one making financial decisions. This was my first time and Jared helped me to get started. He was honest and patient with all my gazillion of questions. He was able to help me transfer an old retirement account into a Gold IRA. Not only was he knowledgeable about the process they have a fantastic team that make sure everything is smooth and easy. Any questions I had they were always on top of.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I was concerned about the economy and the future outlook, I contacted Advantage Gold after watching a webinar by Adam Baratta.  He was very well spoken and made me comfortable with the idea of learning about Gold as an investment.  I spoke with Rob Alexander who gave me a quick walkthrough on their website.  So glad to get all the information I did and can't wait to get started with investing in precious metals</Review>< user_id>

<Review>Matt and Steve are great! I was in a race against time to get my IRA set up. These guys were on it! They led me every step of the way with courtesy and professionalism! The market timed perfectly! They got me in and my metals immediately went up in price! Win! Win! Thank you Advantage Gold! You went above and beyond my expectations!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I worked with Travis Griffin for almost two years before finally investing some of my IRA money in gold and silver. My hesitance was the result of the incessant marketing of gold and silver on TV and the Internet. I was also cautious because I am semi-retired and therefore already withdrawing some of my retirement assets to pay for our living expenses.

I never experienced the "hard sell" approach from Travis and Advantage Gold that led to my reticence. Their main goal was to educate me in the way that gold would fit in with my investment objectives. As a financial advisor, I am used to more traditional investment vehicles, but the information provided by Travis and Advantage convinced me that there was a place for precious metals in my portfolio.

Once started, the process was not only relatively easy, but it was obvious at each step that both Advantage and their IRA custodian, Strata, meticulously followed all the rules required of financial institutions when dealing with investors. This just reinforced my decision to trust my retirement assets to Advantage Gold.

I heartily recommend Advantage Gold to anyone interested in investing in precious metals.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Just wanted to give a special Thank you to Dane K. who assisted, and gave me some information as far as where a person with not a huge amount of money could go to purchase and invest in precious metals, and he confirmed the research I've been doing on the world of finance, the value of the dollar, and some very serious changes that are going to occur in the future, I want to thank him and everyone involved for their time and especially for the free book, you guys are doing an awesome job, and I hope you have continued success.</Review>

Travis has made my first gold buying experience as stress free as possible. We had several conversations getting me up to speed since I knew very little about buying gold. There was no pressure and he explained to me all my options before we even talked about the purchase. Once I decided to buy it was easy and delivery came within 2 days.< /text>

I really loved the overall experience I had with Advantage Gold. Thanks to them I was able to get my retirement out of the stock market and into something I wanted to do for a long time. I recommend talking with Jay because I feel like I really learned something throughout the whole process. Thanks again !!< /review>

Finis Cole sent me a copy of “Five Moves To Checkmate”, which was excellent in explaining the importance of owning gold and made so much sense out of what we see happening in the world today.  Thanks Advantage Gold!< /Review>

I spoke with Brandon at Advantage Gold about adding gold to my portfolio.  He was patient and carefully walked me through all of my options while considering the fact that I've never bought physical gold before.  He got me up to speed over several conversations.  I highly recommend him and the team at Advantage Gold!<//text>

I'm not certain how I first started talking with Finis Cole at Advantage Gold but I felt right away that he was interested in, first-and-foremost, helping me learn about gold as an investment. Throughout the process of working with him, Finis has been incredibly helpful and straight-forward. He referred me to another financial professional who has been great to work with. Finis clearly demonstrated that his priority is helping clients make solid, appropriate and comfortable decisions more than seeing how much gold he can sell. Finis Cole at Advantage Gold is at the top of professionals I've worked with over the years.<//Review>

I am a new client of Advantage Gold.  I cannot recommend this company highly enough.  The service is superior.  I have spent time with Mr. Cole, who made it both educational and convenient to transact in this commodity space.  He is both knowledgeable and service-oriented.  I am extremely pleased with the professionalism and thoroughness of this company.  You cannot go wrong trusting them with your portfolio.<//text>

I would like to thank Advantage Gold and all the people that helped me to set up a self directed IRA to move some money into precious metals.  My main contact was Michael Smollins who was instrumental in making it all happen.  Michael was able to give me the information I needed going into Gold investing and I am sure that we will be working more in the future.  Michael and Advantage Gold earned my 5 star rating.<//Text>

Advantage Gold is the best!!  I had heard that you can do a gold IRA.  I researched and came across Advantage Gold as a highly respected company.  I contacted them and their rep, Michael Smollins, helped guide me through all the ins and outs and the made the process very simple.  I was very happy with him and Advantage Gold.<//text>

<Review>My review here is for Andrew Jordan. He was EXTREMELY helpful and I felt completely comfortable investing my money with advantage gold. He is very knowledgeable and explained everything in detail, I couldn’t be happier after it. When it comes from money especially family money everything I wanted was a place that could help me and give me peace of mind at the end. Thanks Andrew!!!!!!</Review>< UserId.>

I couldn't be happier having Travis Griffin as my account manager! The price had lowed from when I locked it in that morning, yet Travis gave me eight additional silver coins to make up for it. Wow, you might not think it doesn't get better than this, well it did. I hung up with him at 5pm and my order arrived the very next day!< /review>

I wanted to know more about precious metals, so I gave Advantage Gold a call. I spoke to James, who made me feel like family. He was detailed, knowledgeable, and very friendly! I was embarrassed to say I didn’t know much at first, but he walked through the process and made it very simple. Now I have diversification to my portfolio! Thank you so much James. Will be doing more in the future.< /Text>

They helped me roll my IRA into precious metals and made the process so quick and easy. I wish I knew how easy it was going to be working with Advantage Gold, I would have done it sooner. One of the owners is also a best selling author and I loved his last book.<//review>

Got a call from Advantage Gold. The message they left was so fast and distorted I think they said only a few of the numbers. Talked like the Dopeheads of the 80"s and 90's. Must avoid that. Drugs will harm you.< /Review>

Everyone I look up to in my office has been talking about investing in precious metals and how Advantage Gold is the firm to go with. I called in just out of curiosity so that I wouldn’t feel so out of the loop amongst the guys at work and spoke with Marc Neal. He was extremely thorough and made me feel like I was an expert in the market by the end of our conversation! He patiently walked me through all of the ins and outs of diversifying my portfolio and his expertise guided me in the rollover of my 401k!

Thank you AG for helping me learn how to make my money work for me!<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Pierce and Charlie were very helpful and patient with me.  I’m helping my sister roll her 401(k) over to a sdira to best facilitate our wishes to trade securities/mutual funds/ and precious metal/real estate efficiently.   They shot straight, made sense and were over the top transparent.  They outlined advantage golds business model being built around transparency throughout the process.  They were very transparent.  I’m rolling my sisters funds tomorrow into a well matched account with a well matched custodian and trading platform that made sense for us. Thus far 6 phone calls over 3 weeks and I feel very comfortable doing this transaction.  They didn’t push anything on me. They were simply direct and informative and laid out all possible options for me to choose. It’s been a big relief for me and my family.  Thanks Charlie and Pierce and advantage gold< /text>< pictures>

I was interested in investing in Gold as a part of my portfolio and needed someone to explain the process of buying and selling hopefully for a profit and found Jay very very helpful in the process and thankfully I did very well ! My advice is give him a chance like I did and hopefully you will do great as well.</Review>

I’m so glad I picked Advantage Gold to roll over my 401K into precious metals. Micheal Smollins was very instrumental in giving me information on why silver and gold will preserve my wealth better than paper assets. I really appreciated the efforts he made to explain where I was in qualifying for a rollover and how to proceed. And they were very patient when I decided to wait a few months to actually do the rollover. Once I committed to the transaction Micheal and his staff were very kind and efficient in getting the combinations of gold and silver that was right for me. Once the metals were bought I was again impressed on the price that I received from them and their follow up on my purchases are also a nice touch. Overall I feel confident I made a good choice converting my 401K into precious metals and happy how Advantage Gold treated me throughout the process.< /text>

George Bush get five stars from me. I have actually been in touch with him for quite a while about what is happening with gold. He has always been very patient and thorough in terms of explaining what is possible with gold as an investment.

I think that he and his company are doing great work with regular joes like me in terms of all the education that they provide.<//Text>

< Review>
My account manager is Jay Herbert, and I can't say enough about how professional and patient he is. He followed up with me for a period of 2 years from my initial inquiry. HIs persistence coupled with professionalism and demeanor lead me to invest with him and Advantage Gold. He follow-up was always professional and I never felt he was pressuring me, I only felt he was following up with me as I put him off several times due to my busy schedule. When I decided to finally invest, he helped me step by step and couldn't have been more helpful. I give him 5 Stars. If there were 10 , I'd give him 10.< /Review>

Richard Porter made investing in gold interesting and easy.  He guided me step-by-step through the process.  He answered every question and didn't get frustrated when I didn't quite understand.  He would just walk me through until I felt confident I knew what I was investing in.  I'm really happy I had the chance to work with him.</review>

I wanted to buy some gold coins so I asked around and Advantage Gold was recommended to me by a few sources I had checked with. I called the company and spoke to one of their representatives by the name of Alec. He was very professional and was able to answer my questions. I was very happy with the way they handled the transaction and when I am interested in buying more gold, Advantage Gold will get all my business.<//text>

This is an excellent company that I highly recommended to anyone interested in investing in gold. I didn’t know much about the process initially, but my consultant, Richie, was extremely knowledgeable and he simplified the whole process. He patiently walked me through every step and I have no doubts that my investment is in good hands. Overall- 10/10.<//text>

My IRA took a significant loss in 2008, and I've been looking at options to be better diversified before the next major stock market correction. To that end, I've called several different precious metals companies. The 3rd company was Advantage Gold, and my experience was night and day. Brad, who I have been working with, is not pushy like the people I spoke with at other companies. We have had several calls since we first spoke, and he has been very patient with me and has given me an incredible education about the investment. I'm thankful I found this company, and appreciate the guidance and expertise that I have received throughout this process. I would highly recommend calling them!</Text>

<Review>Steve Mathes is excellent. Took the time to fully explain both the Rollover and purchase process. Helped me in selecting the right mix of metals and then appropriate coins. One suggestion: wished we could conduct more elements of the process via email instead of live phone conversations. Sometimes the phone tag can be frustrating. Overall, I would highly recommend Steve and Advantage Gold!< /Review><Name>Jon Stancik (Jon S.)< /Name><user_id>107261373753549841883<//user_id><rate>5<//rate>< pics>

<Review>There are no words that can fully describe how satisfied I am with the patience, information, and service I received from Advantage Gold.  Mr. Brad Lipton has held phone meetings where he guided my significant other and myself through their website, the charts and calculators. The attention to details and willingness to allow us to move forward at our tortoise speed is very appreciated.  I look forward to adding to our position in precious metals using Advantage Gold.<//Review><date>1530316523091< /date><username>paul miller</username><gmapID>0x80c2bb44b8237093:0x772035491190b1d7<//gmapID>< rating>

George Bush has earned his rating from me. He takes a real and genuine concern in what I believe for myself. Gold is still a very new topic to me, so there is at least some uneasiness. But his car and concern to make sure I knew that it could already fit into my strategy was very helpful.</review>

I do not recommend this place at all.  I don't believe they have good work ethics and are only after your money.  I had informally messaged them a long time ago regarding getting information.  Based on my research, I was able to find better sincere services elsewhere.  I told them I am not interested.  Since then, they have been harassing me at least once a week, and sometimes twice a week.  Their number is blocked on my phone but the message still goes to voicemail. I have filed complaints with the FCC, etc.< /text>

I recently had the pleasure to speak with Pierce Datwyler about my interest in adding gold to my portfolio.  Being relatively new to the market, I appreciated Pierce's patience, experience and guidance through the entire process.   I would highly recommend Advantage Gold to all.  Thanks, Pierce.<//review>

Steve is very honest, knowledgeable, has always answered all of my questions and has been so very helpful.  Not only is Steve great, but all of the other employees at Advantage Gold that I have dealt have also been very professional, helpful and great.  I would highly recommend Advantage Gold!!</Review>

I had been curious about gold investing for some time. Shortly after requesting information from Advantage Gold, Brad called me and provided me with a wealth of information. I highly recommend contacting this company if you're looking to learn about investing in gold, and whether or not it's the right investment for you!</review>

Mr. Huffman at Advantage Gold caught me at a good time and engaged me in what turned out to be a long discussion about life and retirement. It's a bit rare for a salesman to actually listen but listen he did. He delved into what happened to my portfolio right after 2008 financial crisis. I actually had done okay but this was more a function of having access to the cash value of life insurance policy, which I thereafter invested in the market when it had bottomed. This time around, Mr. Huffman pointed out, would not be the same. And so, he persuaded me to properly hedge...hedge is what I did and now I can sleep a bit better at night knowing I have a balanced portfolio...and after talking to Mark, a balanced life...thumbs up to The Dude as I now call him.</text>

George and his team at Advantage Gold really have been preaching about why Gold is the way to go for a long time, with all of the craziness happening now, Im glad I have him to really show me the good points of Gold, and Im sure a lot of people are going to realize it too!</Review>

Several months ago we purchased some gold and silver from Rob Alexander. It was a great experience and makes us feel very comfortable should there be a currency collapse or some unforeseen international incident. In addition over time we strongly believe precious metals will out pace inflation.
Thanks for a great and easy experience.</Text>

I have always been interested in a Silver IRA, and Advantage Gold was great to work with! From Day One, Kirill, Steve, and Deborah very supportive in guiding through the roller over process, I could not ask for more professional, customer service oriented people. I highly recommend Advantage Gold!!</text>

I had contacted several other gold companies to do my due diligence, but after contacting Advantage Gold, it was clear why they were so highly rated.  The education was literally miles away from what anyone else could even provide and Paul Fishman really cares.  I don’t know how else to put it, but Paul made me feel so safe and there was never any pressure.  Thank you Paul for giving me all the time you did and allowing me the space to digest and feel comfortable.  I’m looking forward to working with you for years to come.<//Text>

I can't say enough good things about Advantage Gold! I was advised by Sean and he went out of his way to make sure that my IRA rollover went as smooth as possible. He answered all of my questions along the way and was extremely knowledgeable about the entire process. I feel extremely secure about my future and couldn't be happier about the results so far!< /Text>

Thank you Sean Boz and the Advantage Gold team for helping me purchase my new gold and silver coins. I have bought precious metals before through other companies, but this time around couldn't of gone smoother. I wish I had found out about this company before, wow, what a difference. The delivery was immediate and they made everything so easy from start to finish. And on top of everything I got the best deal possible. They were very honest and transparent when comparing prices and I was able to attain exactly what I was looking for.  This is a great company.< /Text>

I loved the service I received from this company! Everyone was extremely helpful and easy to work with especially Michael Smollins who was my Account Executive.  He was very patient, and went above and beyond from the very first call until I purchased my silver. I totally appreciated his warm, humorous, down-to-earth approach.  Thank you Michael and Advantage Gold!< /Text>

Michael is knowledgeable and extremely insightful. Being new to this he took his time to make sure I understood every aspect of buying Gold and it’s benefits. Conversing with Michael seemed as if I was talking to a good friend.To me that means customer service is his first priority! Thank you Michael...you’re dope!!!!< /review>

My wife and I have enjoyed a wonderful experience working with Brad at Advantage Gold. He has spent a great deal of time educating us about precious metals, and we can’t thank him enough for his time and attention to detail. We are looking forward to our relationship with Brad and Advantage Gold moving forward.</Text>

Rob gave me a ton of information about gold and how to roll over my IRA, which was really helpful because I knew nothing about the process. I thought the process would be taunting, but he broke everything down so it was easy for me to understand.   Thanks for working with me and the great customer service.< /review>

I had a great ease learning about gold from Mr. George Bush. It's really nice to see that there's people who conduct business by helping get their potential customers well versed on what they're doing first and foremost.</Text>

Steve Mathes was very patient and provided us with information that allowed us to make an educated decision on the purchase of precious metals. When we finally got to the point of purchase, Steve walked us through all the details and the transaction was quick and efficient. Nice work!< /Text>

Can’t say enough about the education i get from Paul Fishman at Advantage Gold.  Metals arrive quickly and beyond professional.  It’s the only place I will continue to get precious metals.< /Review>

I had a 401K with my previous employer, and needed to roll it in my current employer 401K or an IRA. I have been thinking about gold and called Advantage Gold. I started a conversation with Michael Smollins. He was very helpful, knowledgable, and very professional. I was able to roll my old employer 401K into a gold IRA and am very happy. I now own gold for a safe future investment that will grow. Thank you Michael and Advantage Gold.

83 years old first time buying Gold ! For 60 something odd years I was against owning precious metals now that I am getting older looks like My Gold and Silver will be the only thing left after the stock market seems to be set up for a huge crash again.

< review>
I began researching alternative retirement investing about a year ago, and that's when I found Advantage Gold LLC, and began working with Account Executive Travis G. He walked me though Advantage Gold LLC services offered and how they could assist me with my goals. We discussed the many options available, and I determined that Advantage Gold LLC was the route I wanted to go with. I had an existing 401k from a former employer transferred, and the staff at Advantage Gold LCC walked me thru and assisted with the entire process! I now have more than just a paper investment, but a physical investment of gold and silver, that I'm confident will be a great decision for myself and my son's future.

Since the first rollover, I have completed a second rollover with some additional precious metals added to my portfolio, including platinum.

The relationship formed with this great company, means more than the services provided. They will take care of you like you're family!< /review>

Criminal! Bought $9k in gold 4 years ago. Spot price raised $120 an ounce. Sold 2 years ago and they say I LOST $2k. Buyer beware. I am a verified customer I have paperwork to prove it. Thank you Charlie for taking $2,000 from me.<//text>

i wanted to buy silver with our modest nest egg rather than leave it in the bank , for god knows what could happen to it .  crazy world now-a -days !!       i made a call to ADVANTAGE  GOLD AND SILVER  and was connected to JAY HEBERT .   BEST MOVE I COULD HAVE MADE  !!!    this young man is very capable and knowledge .   i know next to nothing about silver ,  but he does  !!   he listened to me tell him what i wanted , then he answered any and all questions my wife and i had . great people there .   when we were sure exactly what we  wanted  , jay took us through the steps that were needed making very clear  what to expect along the way . 4 days later we received our purchase .   no more worries about the bank closing their doors  , not allowing us access to our safety deposit boxes .   more over ,  when i have questions ,  i ask for Jay Hebert and he answers any questions i come up with .  they make a tough decision a lot easier .  besides ,   Jay is a very good fisherman  !< /text>

Marc Neal was fantastic. He made it very easy to understand  how owning precious metals works and guided me to be able to make my own decisions. He is very informative and educated me in to be able to call my own shots. I would absolutely refer a friend or family member. I look forward to doing more business with him in the future.</Text>
