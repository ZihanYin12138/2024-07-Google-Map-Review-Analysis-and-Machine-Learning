< review>
Came today to get a storage for a few items and they had great customer service.I got helped right away. The people are really nice and polite. On top of that the storage room that I was getting was in great condition. Everything was nice and clean. I highly recommend coming here they have the best prices. I recommend anybody to come and do business here.</review>

<review>They hike up the rent too often. Also, too expensive for a small storage unit. Also, locks are 'stolen.' My storage unit was broken into. No cameras. No security. I promptly removed my things and canceled it.< /review>< Pictures>

Office people are very courteous. Office and restrooms are very clean, free coffee and drinking water available.
Once inside of the safety gate, there is driving access to the units....and other than the rents increase 3 times in less than 2 years, I have no complaints.</Text>

The manager Manuel is a total prick, the website says call for assistance and all he tells is that you have to come in personally cause he can't discuss nothing over the phone... Either fix the site or you gotta do better to help the customer after all you are getting payed....< /text>

They’re never too busy, which is great for me, unfortunately for this place. I don’t know how this place was before the contagion, but during these times one under appreciated quality food.
Enjoy, but please not all at the same time. Otherwise I’ll have to remove my review. 😄<//review>< gmap_id>

It has some minor differences. Nonetheless, the food is rather good and the service is well. However, they do not give you chopsticks unless you look Chinese apparently.

I ordered the eggplant dish with pork.

The food here was super tasty! I'd definitely recommend getting the schezuan fish! Also, service was pretty good. Finally, the portions were a lot bigger than the other reviews let on especially the noodles which come in a pretty standard bowl for noodles at a reasonable price for the Bay Area.< /review>

<Review>As a Berkeley native, this is my favorite local Chinese restaurant. With a pleasant decor that is a cut above the usual, Da Lian has tasty, fresh, and well-prepared dishes that are not greasy but sparkle with flavor. I recently introduced a friend to this restaurant for dinner and he just loved everything we ordered, so I would gladly recommend it to anyone. Great place for lunch, too.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< username>

<review>Fish ball soup. $5.99. Holy smokes this was spicy. My husband who normally eats fire sauce was sweating up a storm. Not too many fish balls though. Mixed with glass noodles, seaweed, and tofu noodles and spam.

Service was excellent! Some people said the water they serve didn't have ice but we asked for it and they brought it out. 10% off bill too with yelp check in.

Parking lot is very limited.< /review><user_id>103366435168553792668<//user_id>< pictures>

<Review>Unpretentious Northern Chinese food. Very tasty, if you like spicy food this is the place for you, though they are happy to cater to a milder palate.  The vegetables are always cooked perfectly, the proteins are well butchered and prepared. They will replace any protein with tofu, excellent place for me and my vegetarian boyfriend!< /Review><UserId.>109092249157529106230</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80857ea1bb18d31f:0xe4fb2c4af9e92782<//gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< rate>

Very disappointing and insulting. I ordered Jiajiang Mein and the sauce was too less. I should have taken a picture when it first came... so I asked about more sauce, and then they just put some oil-ish on the plate, without actually putting more sauce. I'll never visit here.

190202 update

I visited this place again about two weeks ago and forgot to write an updated review. I had missed the jiajiang mien sold here, which was the reason of my visit, but it ended up with some frustration. The menu was too salty and not as tasty as it was. Price was still too high for the quality. If you are not out of budget and you want some quiet place to have dinner then it's fine. But if not, definitely not recommendable. For the quality, Great China is better, with similar price. For the quantity, Heat Cafe is more recommendable with a much more reasonable price.

First review:
Not bad. But a bit more expensive than it is supposed to be.<//review>< Rate>

I had several good meals there and then had a take-out that was inedible, as the shrimp tasted like they had been left on their counter top for the past week.  I am surprised that the small amount I ate didn't make me sick. I will not go back.</text>

Dalian as a coastal city in Northeastern China doesn't have many distinctions, they tried to broad their menu by representing the whole northeastern region but did not succeed. The outcomings are just salty and greasy Cantonese dishes with somewhat northern twists imitation, which I and my guest didn't enjoy so much.<//review>

Da Lian had some legit asian food, I'll give them that. My server was pretty poor, and she was pushy in getting my table to order. She oversold us on the portions, and while the meal was pretty decent, it wasn't spectacular. I'd probably pass on this place again if given the option.</text>

Not-for-Chinese Chinese food, doesn't matter what you order cause they all taste the same. And even it's empty, it takes around 20 min to order and 20 min to check.<//Text>

< Review>
Food prices are reasonable and the quality is great. Nice place to visit, but definitely aimed for younger people. The dark atmosphere was a little too much, couldn’t even see the color in my food.

The service itself, however, was terrible. Seated at the bar for twenty minutes until I asked a waitress if the bartender was ever going to take my order. Kind of annoying, didn’t even get offered water. Seating could be managed better. Strong drinks good food, though.</Review>

The vibe is chill. Happy hour is a decent price. I would go back. Only complaint is they didn't have all of stuff on their menu. Literally everything I wanted to try was not something they were serving right now, or they were out of something. I would strongly suggest they let people know that certain things are either seasonal, brunch only items, or not currently available. Either don't promote something you don't have, create a smaller evening menu which you can actually provide, or let the customers know, what is actually available. It shouldn't be a guessing game of what do you have. BUT I can say whatever was available was pretty good.<//Text>

We went out for a birthday dinner on a Friday night.  There was not many options for dining in downtown Riverside after 9pm!  I don't know if it's covid related but All restaurants seem to close too early in this town.  The Lobby was about the only place still serving food and although our steaks were excellent, the menu was pretty limited and everything had to be ordered separately.  The sides we ordered were not anything exceptional.</Text>

Wonderful experience for my family on Mother's Day!

The food was terrific (and they offered plenty of vegan choices for our daughter), the owner and staff were professional and lovely people.

Fianlly, our server, Giselle, was awesome!< /review>

Went to The Lobby last night for some drinks with a couple friends and they were amazing! Ray is one of the best bartenders I’ve ever had. Definitely a good time—especially when club night starts. The DJ plays at 10pm and it gets even better, can’t wait to go back!!</Text>

Should have listened to the bad reviews. The hostess seemed annoyed rather than inviting, the bartenders ignore you, the waitress took 30 minutes to acknowledge us and then forgot to give my license back. They NEVER answer the phone so I had to reach out by IG only to be told they wouldn't mail me my license. Such an inconvenience to leave work to get my license back. Wish I could give zero stars< /Text>

We had an awesome late dinner with Friends.
Great drinks, excellent food, and equally amazing/friendly service!
The place is open 'till late and has a really good atmosphere.
Plus, to top it all it's safely operated by a top notch staff!
Sorry, we owe the photos because we were too busy enjoying ourselves.< /text>< GmapID>

<review>Everything was EXCELLENT here.  Due to COVID most places that we have been to, quality of service and food have been poor and prices high.  The Lobby was absolutely FABULOUS on ALL counts.   Service was outstandng; food was to die for and being my birthday,  I got ice cream that was soooo goood...and I'm NOT an ice cream girl.  Highly recommend this place!<//review><resp>{'time': 1617254563102, 'text': 'Thank you for your wonderful review! Happy late birthday!🎉'}< /resp><Rate>5</Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< name>

Food and drinks were great. A tad pricey, but nothing unreasonable.
On a cold, drizzly morning they had a tent (it was needed), but they zipped up the front entrance making it almost "indoors" - air circulated very softly. This made it more weather-comfortable, but just something to be wary of if you're CoViD sensitive.<//text>

Because of covid they leave the door open, so it can get pretty cold inside. Wear a jacket!
Wonton nachos were good
The blu burger was great!
Bartenders super friendly and attentive 10/10.
Great first date spot!<//text>

Love this place! Came here again this past Sunday with friends who hadn't been yet. Blake was our bartender and one of the best ones I've ever had. Really cool guy, super creative drinks he based off of you personally.

Always get the "Dealer's Special", you won't be disappointed! Can't wait to go back and have Blake as our bartender again.

On another note, we noticed that the gross sewage smell that filled the bar from last time was quite "faint" this time. Haven't tried the food yet but that odor would be my only complaint. Scented luxury candles will help and add to your great ambiance.< /text>

Wanted to try this place but won't be happening. Seems like they are selective. After waiting 35 - 40 minutes to be seated for a drink, hostess decides to make accommodations for someone that arrived and was seated within minutes. If I could give 0 stars, I would. . . Try Fire Up 🔥  instead.</Text>

My hubby and I tried this place for a date night last night and we couldn’t have been more pleased. It was everything we were hoping for. Great ambiance....very romantic. The service was outstanding, the food & drinks were delicious and very reasonably priced. We’ll definitely be back again! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//review>

<Text>The drinks were great but the service was the worst part...our server ignored us. The other server picked up the slack was kind of disappointed (EDIT While I appreciate the owners reply below the service wasn't "slow" The SERVER ignored us. She actively checked on other tables around us ignoring us to the point where we joked about it. It then became painfully obvious that she did not want to check on us as she talked to other tables ...and you weren't that busy. I am stating this from someone who has a service background. The other server checked on us and got us are 2nd drink. to be clear drinks came out great, our appetizer came out fast and was delicious....Your server could care less if we were there or not  I get its hard to build a new business during this time and wish you well. )</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFVlTLoBracdQRXGRoUhW30FQb970OHSXfh7eK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>{'time': 1598020773139, 'text': 'Thank you for your review.

The ramen is absolutely delicious! The broth is extremely flavorful and the pork melts in your mouth. My favorite part of ramen is always the egg, and they do a great job with the egg too. But the BEST part about this restaurant is Sophia. She is seriously the best server ever. She is so kind and truly wants you to have an amazing experience. Ask for her opinion if you are unsure of what to get. She will happily give you options and explain any questions you may have. We love you Sophia and Silverlake!< /Text>

Great Ramen, I try Garlic Truffles Ramen... it is great. And then I add the chilies paste and it became awesome. Also, you need to try the 3 kinds of mushrooms here. So tasty. Finally, if you like chicken karaage, try it here... it is better than most place. Overall: 5stars and the service is great. 😋🤩</review>

Best tonkotsu broth and ramen noodles of any Ramen place I've tried in the area. Chashu is good too, but it is not presented like the traditional round thin slice. Still pretty good. Don't be on a rush for dinner time cause waiting times to be seated can be a bit rough.< /review>

<text>It's been a while since I've had ramen and was recommended this place. It was about a 45 wait.  I wasn't blown away but it was still good and portion size was very big I did order extra Noodles. A nice little cozy place.

THE BEST TSUKEMEN I'D EVER HAD
The broth of the tsukemen is so unique: a bit sour, a bit sweet, a bit salty, a bit creamy, and a lot of tastiness.
The shashu pork is also out of this world: it melts in your mouth with a hint of charcoal grilled smell
I also love the interior design here: they combine Japanese tradition and Western modern seamlessly and subtly
Definitely will be back when they open for indoor dining again<//review>

The ramen is very rich and tasty.  However my personal favorite dishes on Silverlake’s menu are their rice bowls (especially the chicken karrage one) , they’re only $10, super filling, and hit the taste buds just right<//Text>

THE SHOYU ON FIRE is the best ramen EVER! Spicy broth, spicy chile paste, spicy jalapeno. Just awesome! Price point is a little high for noodles, broth and some protein but it's kind of a lot so you can almost get 2 meals out of it. Added my own hard-boiled egg and seaweed to kick it up a notch without the extra cost. Ordered to go so I can't speak for the dine-in experience but I would definitely order from here again. Hopefully they start taking phone orders soon because ordering through DoorDash is a pain.<//Text>

We visit Irvine Spectrum frequently and are familiar with the restaurants that are there, so when I was trying to decide on a restaurant, Silverlake Ramen popped up as a dine-in and since one of my kids loves Ramen, I figured why not.

First thing, which is not a big deal, but I am not a beer drinker, I just wanted a glass of regular white house wine, and so did the guest I brought, but they only had beer and whatever other spirits they offered.

Then we placed our order and one of the rice bowls came out about 20min before the last person got their food, when you have a party of 5 food should come out together, the last food to be delayed was the Ramen bowl, when I questioned the staff about that, I was told that a lot of people are ordering Ramen??? Uhm .. your restaurant is called Silverlake RAMEN! And when I got my food, my noodles tasted way too starchy,  and hard, they were not cooked properly at all. I am a bit disappointed because I was really looking forward to some authentic ramen, but I guess this will not be the restaurant for me, the rice bowls were good though I heard!< /Review>

Noodles were clumped together the entire time. Pork was mediocre. Only reason I got this was because Hiro Nori was busy. Do yourself a favor and go to Hiro Nori. Waaaaaay better by a long shot.</text>

Excellent ramen at a fair price point. I had the classic pork ramen and it was very high quality and good tasting. I also got the bottomless lemonade which was a very fair price and the service was impeccable. The waiter was constantly coming over to refill my drink, this was possibly the best refill service I’ve ever had. The food came out quick as well. The servers were really nice and the cashier has no issues splitting our cheque. If I could give 6/5 I would.< /Review>

Disappointed at how hyped this place is...
Ordered the Classic Tonkotsu and Tskukemen for takeout, (no phone orders, just online pickup thru Doordash, which is annoying) and both were just mediocre.

I paid extra for bamboo shots - not crunchy or flavorful at all...
The pork was wonderful but everything else was lacking the wow factor I've heard about the food.

Definitely won't be back considering the hassle of ordering, parking at the Spectrum, and lack of depth in flavor of the food.</Text>

<Review>Honestly one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had, and I've had ramen from my stay in Japan, and I must say this place almost takes me back, it's that good.
I usually add extra pork, an extra egg, and extra noodles.</Review><rating>5<//rating><resp>None</resp>< username>

<text>The waitress was awesome, the broth was okay... Alot of missing flavors, a really good pork broth but if felt incomplete. Also kale in ramen is not it, the bitterness of the kale and the lack of flavor in the broth was not it but our waitress was great! The service awesome and the pork itself was delicious, thick cut and flavor full</text><response>None<//response>< Name>

One of the best ramen in town! Try the blaze ramen and their pork bun. Their ramen is creamy pork based and full of add ons and choice of meat. Staff are very kind and courteous.  One of the best dine in restaurants in Irvine Spectrum .</Review>

I'll preface this by saying this was a to-go order

I really wanted to try this place considering all the hype it has. I got the Blaze and Classic ramen with a chicken karage bowl. Both ramens were okay. The broth was very rich and creamy and had good pork taste. They give you a choice of protein (chicken, pork or tofu); I picked pork. The pork was a thick piece, which I prefer, and had good flavor with some charcoal taste. The Blaze was definitely unique and their signature ramen. The medium spicy was perfect for me. I also added black garlic to the classic ramen which was amazing. I definitely recommend getting the black garlic it you are a garlic person.

My only problem was that the noodle was too soft for me. It seemed like they cooked the noodle a little too long before they put it in the container. This caused the noodle to clump together and they cooked even more. By the time I got to the noodle, it wasn't great. Maybe it would've been better if I ate there.

The karage bowl was just okay. I didn't love the creamy sauce they put on top and the chicken was basically similar to a lot of other karaage bowls.<//text>

Broth and overall ramen left a little much to be desired. Didn't really have the full bodied flavor profile that I love in ramen.<//Review>

Glad I stumbled upon Silverlake Ramen yesterday evening (7/10/20) during my stroll in the Spectrum Shopping Center. Their sign that showed a yummy bowl of ramen with the title “best ramen in town” caught my eye (and oddly enough sign I typically go straight to reviews first). So I stopped by the host station to check out their menu and I pretty much decided to stay after being greeted warmly by the two hostesses.

Food: I had an awesome waitress Sophia gave me great recommendations which I was able to confirm from the Yelp reviews. To start, I ordered the Pork Belly Bun and my…. DELICOUSNESS!!! You must try- and the price is very good for the quality. It gave me the “melt in your mouth” experience. Ugh, can’t wait to go back. Since I’m a spicy chicken ramen lover, ordered The Blaze with Chicken at spicy level medium. This definitely got the job done. The bowl was huge, the portion was filling, and the two pieces of chicken were large. You really get what you pay for. The spice level was perfect. They also have add-ons like corn.  I also was very pleased with the brand

Atmosphere: beautiful. Inside is chill and upscale and they have plenty of seating. Great spot if you want to eat alone and people watch with patio views (which was what I did) or the shade patio open pace or inside with shade and still enjoy views. Great for social distancing and everyone is wearing masks.

Customer service: FIVE STARZZZ. I was honestly blown away at how well I was treated. Everyone was super friendly, from the host and especially my waitress, Sophia. She had a great attitude and knew a lot about the menu. Her friendliness really brightened up my day. On top of that, the manager came by to ask how I like the the pork belly bun and authentically shared about how they prepared it and he was glad I liked it. I had an unusually long wait for my ramen to arrive. I was clearly an oversight and everyone was so apologetic. Even the CHEF Henry came to my table to apologize and make it right. I was blown away- he was so sincere and I really appreciated the stellar service. I look forward to coming back with my family and friends.

100% recommend this place- can’t wait to return! I hope y'all stay consistent with the quality & service!<//text>

Tim was nice and did an excellent job on my acrylic nails but the ladies that work there embarrassed me in front of everyone when I put my sneakers on after a pedi. I don’t usually have to wait longer than 20 minutes for my toe nails to dry so I thought I was okay. The ladies started freaking out. Tried telling me I need to avoid wearing shoes for a whole day. I’ve never had to do that after getting a pedi, for one. Secondly, it was raining. I did not want to wear flip flops. They kept pressing me to wear them and I was so uncomfortable I wanted to cry. Bad customer service.< /Review>

< Review>
My first time here! It’s been over a year since I got a mani and pedi.
I’m retracting my 5 star review. The lady who gave me a pedicure infected my big toe.
I didn’t give her permission to take out my ingrown nail. She just started taking it out. My big toe is now infected! I have to go to the doctor and take care of it now.
I will not be coming back here! Also, their utensils are not sanitized. Every nail salon I used to go too would have their clippers in such in separate sealed bags or in a jar of sanitizer.<//Review>

<text>My partner and I came in for scheduled services today and were really impressed. The front desk staff was polite. We were seen promptly by our servicing staff, Tina and Lisa. Both were friendly and professionally. She helped me pick out the perfect colour and even did a third coat to ensure best colour pay off. The space was pretty, crazy clean, and organized. I will definitely be returning and recommending this place to everyone!</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< pictures>

< Review>
Let me start by saying I love places that'll do your fingers and toes at the same time. It makes me feel much more pampered and relaxed, and it saves me time. I had Lisa do my toes and Tina do my nails, and they were both amazing! Lisa's massage was very firm and relaxing. Tina accidentally messed up on a finger (dip powder), and instead of just ignoring it, she redid my nail without me asking. Then, when one of my hands wasn't drying correctly, she shaved off the top coat and re did it. THEN, when I went home and completely cracked my nail off like an idiot, I was able to come back in and have her re-do that finger no questions asked. I will absolutely be returning here when I want to treat myself!!!</Review>

Set up an appointment for that day online with Tina. She was wonderful - checking the length and shape of my nails repeatedly, making sure she got everything perfect. Great color selection, and a good price for a great gel manicure. The hand and neck massage at the end were a nice touch. The salon was clean and bright.

Definitely coming back to Hi Tech Nail and Spa the next time in the area.<//Review>< Pics>

Lisa took amazing care of me, with a few laughs, and a BEAUTIFUL dip set.
My previous nail salon jacked up my nails so viciously, and Lisa had me walking out of there with my nails looking like a lilac pink snack.
Took my friend back for pedicures, she loved her, I loved mine. All in all 5 stars all day!</Text>

<Review>Heads up-- I've never been good at writing long reviews. This place is lovely! Everyone is so sweet. Technician perfectly shaped my kinda-short nails into little daggers. I like to look like I can claw a man's eyes out. Another woman did my pedicure, but I didn't get her name.  We did dip powder on my hands and gel polish on my feet. Wonderful experience.
I am 1000% sure I'll be back!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Fantastic spot! They are well versed in nail design and had many options. The space is tiny, but the ambiance is elegant, the staff is friendly, and they made me feel like they could pull off any of the fashion nail designs I have admired based on the art on the nail tech's wore themselves. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town again.</Text>

The best! I'm glad I found them, I won't go anywhere else now. They treat you so nicely! It's so clean and cheery inside. Just call a few ahead because they book up sooo fast. Here is my no chip after several days - looks great!****< /review>

So thankful for this nail salon! The owners are very personal and amazing people. I requested my favorite color and the owner ordered it and had it for my next visit. I would recommend Hi Tech Nail and Spa before anywhere else . Thank you to everyone who truly makes every experience amazing!!< /Text>

It was peaceful. My nail tech was so sweet. She listened and took her time. She even offered to fix a broken nail if I needed it because of my past experience at a terrible nail shop. I will be returning.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I received probably the best manicure of my life today from Tina.
I usually get the SNS dip powder and this time I needed a nude color for a wedding I'm in this weekend. Nudes are always hot or miss for me. We picked out N2 together and she gave me a rounder shape (which I've never had) and I wanted them a little thinner than last time so she filed it down a bit. IM IN LOVE.
I cannot sing her praises enough.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

The place itself is very clean and all of the staff are super welcome and friendly. I did not feel as if they were gossiping about me-like I have experienced at other nail salons.
They accept tips in cash only. I will definitely be coming back again.< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I'm posting this for my best friend who just called me crying after leaving your nail salon today! Since she doesn't have yelp I told her I'll post her complaint to you guys..

"She just cut my skin from her filing not that she cut my nails short she refused to cut them basically and was like just file and then the color I got should have had a color underneath and just put this as a coat over it but she just put like 5 layers of paint on to make it not see through. Part of the nail isn't fully. Covered with paint the polish got all up over my cuticle. And when she filed after it was dry she didnt get under the nail to pull the polish from under your fingernail. So some nails look weird and a replacement polish should take like 45 minutes I was there for an hour and a half."

An hour and a half!!! Seriously?! I'm even freakin' shocked! Also, her finger was bleeding for hour after the appointment by the way! Save your money y'all.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80910742cf089da5:0x1fef1a6cfeb66c21</Gmap_id></record>

Tina was extremely kind and immediately put me at ease. If I go back, I’m requesting her! 3 stars only because my shellac has nearly peeled off after less than a week. It’s possible it was the polish but the quality is not impressive.< /Text>

<review>Both of the guys who do acrylics do a great job! They take their time and make sure you get exactly what you want. The ladies here are very sweet too and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and pampered. Tons of color options for both regular and gel polish. I'd recommend scheduling an appointment, even if you're going in the same day just to make sure they can fit you in. Love Hi-Tek nails, I'll continue going here!</review><Rating>5<//Rating><Time>1517971605502<//Time>< userid>

<Text>My daughter went and got her nails done and they charged her $50 and her nails were very bad. Not only did she have a lot of cuts on her fingers the nails were crooked and the price was way to high for the quality of nails that she got. Definitely would not recommend it. So upset I had to pay so much for bad nails.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Horrible! had a pedicure and the lady cut my toe. She then quickly sprayed alcohol on it and it burned. I ended up with a severe infection which I have had to complete 3 regiments of antibiotics. While there, another lady was complaining about her nails being cut to short and the techs were amused by her. Will never go there again!!< /Text><time>1536864046372< /time>< username>

<Text>I have eaten there multiple times on the last year. Not the best Thai food I have tried . .  There were eggshell small pieces on my last order. Overall, it's a nice place to dine, but sometimes is over packed.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Chicken was rock hard and stringy....ice tea was supposed to have coconut milk barely had any and was small....never eating here again. Service was terrible when I called and got hung up on trying to get some redemption.< /Text>

<Review>Tucked away upstairs this can be a great place to get some food in the crowded Telegraph area.  The staff is always nice, you are usually seated right away and the food comes hot and fast.  Two of my favorite items are the spicy fried rice and the Thai ice tea with coconut milk!<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>Celebrated my birthday here with my family. The food was great. The employees were so nice and accommodating. My grandpa can't have any spicy stuff because of a throat condition, so they brought him samples of the green and red sauce to taste before he ordered his meal. And it is decently priced! Highly recommend!< /review>< Gmap_id>

We took my father there for his 88th bday for lunch. A lot of hustling and taking care of the customers. The brothers were very friendly, attentive and even funny. The music playing was a bit loud. The food came out nice and hot and tasty. I will be back.< /Review>

Our friend, Jen, recommended this place, so we thought we would have a go. She was definitely right my. The food was fantastic, both in terms of the selection (I had the molcajete el coyote) and the presentation (really should have taken a picture here, but it was beautifully presented in a molcajete). They also make their own corn tortillas fresh. Definitely a great addition to Woodland's Latino food scene.</Text>

The food is very good.  But I have been there about 6 times  and always  is something missing.  First they run out food in the buffet,  second time food was cold,  3rd time we keep waiting for our drinks,  4th time they charge us more than they should have. 5th time no food left in the buffet<//Review>

<Review>I have seen many good reviews of this place, so we decided to try it on Sunday and was very disappointed. I Would not recommend this place based on our experience today.
Sunday lunch for 2 adults 1 child was $54.

Food here was alright, not great at all.
I had the chicken sopes plate, chicken was good but overall plate was alright nothing to say "it's delicious". Horchata was served in a nice clay glass too narrow though, so be prepared to ask for drink refill before getting your food.

Husband was never offered tortillas with his plate which usually are included and brought along. The Super michelada was very salty, he complained and was brought a second one but was still very salty and seemed like they forgot the shot of tequila it should've had.

For my 7 year old, I especifically ordered one chicken enchilada. But was brought a plate with beans, rice and 2 enchiladas filled with what seemed like a salad of lettuce, sour cream and cheese on top. We though that was from the kids menu so we didn't complain but we were charged $10.99. Plus $1.49 for his drink which was regular water (everywhere else we have been to water is free).  Their kids plates should be $7.99 including a drink.

Be careful with the salsa they have in a bottle it is super spicy.

Customer service: The restaurant was not super busy at all, They had 3 waitresses. our waitress, came by only to take our order and deliver our food. Never came by to ask how we were doing, if we needed something else. There were two other waitresses that we very busy with their own tables coming by and asking how things were, being very attentive with their customers but while making rounds they would skip our table. we had to call them over the 2 times we needed something because our waitress was hiding somewhere. After taking our request they would send our waitress over to deliver it.

Overall, food was alright, portions seem small for price=1 star
restaurant was clean and ambiance was fair=1 star
customer service is lacking.
prices need improvement.<//Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The place is spacious and the service is good but in the food they have to improve, because in my opinion the menudo is the worst that I have tasted in Woodland and the pozole is very rare they put carnitas and that I have not seen in Nowhere, although they do their best to give a good service and that if we have to thank for the moment I do not want to return, maybe in the future I will give them another chance.

(Original)
El lugar es amplio y la atención es buena pero en la comida tienen que mejorar, por que en mi opinión el menudo es el más malo que e probado en Woodland y el pozole es muy raro le ponen carnitas y eso yo no lo avía visto en ningún lado, aunque se esmeran en dar un buen servicio y eso si hay que agradecer por lo pronto no tengo ganas de volver tal vez en el futuro les de otra oportunidad.</review>

No comment... They may send more of their "night stalkers" to terrorize me, although I quit going to church there over 20 years ago... (when I moved back to the South Bay, which is where I was originally from). I'm not sure who their Pastor is now, but he should do something about their Church stalkers.<//Text>

Should have left years sooner
Wish Mr O the best sounds the self absorbed witchhunting that goes on with the membership. Really like Pederson and Ms Cannon's presentation..
. I was told i wasn't invited to a singles tea party
Told by someone else no one liked me and to take the hint by a volunteer. I caught doing the naughty in parking lot

I hitched a ride with someone to San Francisco and she told me to sit in back she didn't want to be seen with me I thought it was me but turns OUT it was them .Found two other churches that are pure  magic in south bay.< /text>

It is currently launching satellite campuses through the San Francisco Bay Area. These locations have a more modern/contemporary style with a much weaker connection to the churches historic roots.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This is an awesome church. Incredibly welcoming. Wonderful worship music. Very inspiring messages each weekend. Senior Pastor John Ortberg is an extremely compelling disciple of Christ. It's a deep bench at Menlo with many wonderful pastors. And with so many wonderful programs. Sunday is my favorite day! Menlo Church is true to its tagline: Everybody's Welcome, Nobody's Perfect, Anything's Possible.</Review>

Amazing church with a huge heart for impacting the local community with great love. John Ortberg's messages are fantastic. Everyone and anyone is welcome here. The mantra is that no one is perfect. So just roll out and you will find a family of people that truly care about you for who you are, regardless of your background or beliefs.< /Text>

<text>(update: better 2nd time) My first time at the famous Menlo Church led by Pastor John ortberg ...and it was a mixed bag... the sermon was good about women ...most of the people were generally nice,  but the lady who sat next to me squeezed  getting in and then told me she had the flu (and she sat closer to me then to her friend on the other side that was strange , plus she literally typed on her phone the entire time , even during the prayer) and then as I was leaving a  black lady gave me a angry look as if to say 'what am u doing here' ,; that was strange too...there weren't   that many black people there, but the one person w/ black skin color that I did encounter didn't seem to like me ...even tho I never knew her, never met her , didn't talk to her ...just walked past her...(is that racism?) ...( but I know by now that some people go to church, sadly, with a personal agenda that is not always Biblical & there's not much the church can do about it...when it is done manipulatively & subtle ) but I'll give it a second chance... thank you for the good sermon ....and most of you for being hospitable fellow Christians . God bless you all. John BA/BA/M.Div<//text>< pictures>

John Ortberg is phenominal. When my wife and moved to silicon valley, my parents mentions this church because they had done a John Ortberg bi le study. The music is amazing, the church itself is beautiful, they serve philz coffee and fresh donuts between services and have all kinds of family services. We haven't tried the life groups, but we've heard that all the service and community opportunities are really nice.</Text>

<Text>My wife and I visited Menlo Park one Sunday when we happened to be in the bay area (we live in the central valley, but if we could we would attend here!).  This is a church where a lot of good things are happening!  We attended both a contemporary and traditional service, and both were outstanding.  We went to the main church, but there are apparently a variety of options, depending upon your preference. Music was awesome.  This is a big church building, but strategically placed screens made it so everyone has a good view of what is going on. John Ortberg was preaching when we came, and you will have to search far and wide to find another who will compare with this speaker.  Ortberg is articulate and inspiring. Following the service he prayed for us and a number of other individuals that came forward after the service.  He is not only a gifted speaker but author of a number of best selling books.

There is a lot going on here with children's ministries for families with children.   People were friendly and accepting.  The director of small groups and a number of other ministries greeted us and spent quite a while talking with us, explaining the various ministries of the church.  If you are from the bay area you have the wonderful opportunity to grow in the influence of this wonderful church body.  If not, you will have to content yourself with watching their sermons online as I do.<//Text><UserId.>103080185899855158347< /UserId.><Gmap_id>0x808fa4afe7a4a775:0x1c8dc0166f5e0bb3< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

What an organisation!  We are visiting from England and from the minute we drove into the car park and found a 'first-time guest' space we felt cared for.  We were met by Linda, who showed us the best place to sit (my daughter has autism and doesn't generally 'do' church), we appreciated the sung worship - understated, professional band, the testimony, the sermon with visuals on screen - and the lemonade & doughnuts after the service!

Thank you for all you're doing - God bless your extraordinary ministry and...see you tomorrow!</Review>

I had my first archery experience here with  my friends and we all had fun. The lady staff helped us with a quick lesson. Thank YOU for being patient and nice to do that and always properly wearing a mask. On here, I saw some customers complained about that some of staff worked without any personal equipment protection. It was true in my case. Besides, some customers  didn't strictly follow the mask instruction. Anyway, great people and place. Be safe first and enjoy!</review>

Excellent experience! Considering to take archery as my life long hobby.

Pay attention the service is first come first serve. Fee differs if you are taking your own equipment.< /Review>

<Text>Had a great experience this past weekend. Brought my two-year old bow in thinking it would need a major tune-up. The bow tech took me right away and did some quick adjustments and it was right as rain. He also helped answer all of my other questions and got me and my equipment all sorted out. Will definitely be back for my bow needs.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Only one staff member was actually wearing his mask. No other staff members were. The oldest, tallest staff member behind the counter had his mask down under his chin. Very few customers were wearing masks, most didn't even have them on their face. People aren't wearing masks in there, the sign on the doors a joke. It's a very, very small space too with no windows. Covid would be so easily transmissible. Just frustrated we took the time to come down to check the place out and it was like they didn't even care. It was pretty ridiculous to see. We walked in and walked right out.< /Review>

This is the great place where we bought our bows for whole family, folks working here are super helpful and knowledgeable. 5 stars easily.

Nevertheless today (still in midst of pandemic) two of their staff were not wearing their face coverings as well as some of the customers.
This gets them two stars out because they risk their and customers health.<//Text>

I'm from out of state and some of the shops in the bay aren't so pleasant to be honest but luckily I had the best experience at this shop I walked in they offered to set up as many bows as I wanted to shoot you can try all bows and accessories before buying
very knowledgeable Alexander is the man but all the employees and who seemed to be the owner where very personable and are there for anything you need to be comfortable would recommend this place to anyone<//review>

This is a great place to learn and practice archery.  As a beginner, they taught me safety first before letting me shoot.  They also keep a sharp eye on the people on the firing line.  You can either rent an archery set, or you can bring your own to shoot.  They also have a large line of equipment for sale.  The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful.  The range can get very busy, so it's best to register online or come early.< /review>

Dial the bow in very quickly I shot at the indoor range they have for about a half an hour and walk way very happy. this shop is about an 1 hour and 10 minutes from my home it's a long way to go but I will be back and I will tell my friends and other people about this place it's a great place.   Thank you Wayne I appreciate your time and your knowledge...👍👍

I've been here on and off for a number of years - mostly because it's close and there are very few archery stores around the Bay Area. My experience with their knowledge and abilities has been fairly good. Except for arrow repair where it has been hit and miss. My experience on average of interacting with the staff has generally been fairly poor. It depends on who you talk with. The owner (I think), Wayne is usually friendly and helpful, but most of my other experiences with other staff has been ok to very poor. They can be pretty indifferent and unfriendly in my experience.

I would come here more often if the average staff experience was more friendly. It's a nice shop otherwise.< /text>

I originally went down because they carried a specific arrow rest I had been looking for and they're about an hour from home.
Needless to say, I'll make the hour trip again anytime to work with Alexander and the team at Archery only.
Alexander got me set up and tuned with the rest I was looking for, set up a new peep sight and kisser button and then took some time walking me through some shooting technique and pointers as I'm only a couple months into archery.
I had a bunch of questions for him and he took his time to give me detailed thorough explanations.
This is definitely a five star establishment and would recommend them to anyone interested in archery.< /review>

Visited in person, was very helpful in picking a bow. Later, they called to ask if I wanted to place a reservation on a bow I was interested in but wasn't in stock at that moment.

They asked for credit card info. Not wanting to share CC info over a phone, I said it would be fine if they can't reserve it, and instead give me a call so I know when to drive all the way up to Milipitas to buy it. Customer service promptly hung up without a answer.

I'm leaving this review at 3 stars for now, not sure if the call was a rude manager or if it was a scam attempt by a 3rd party phisher.</review>

<Text>I got a bow as a gift and went here to get setup and try it out. Wayne helped me through the whole process. He was patient to answer all my queries and get me set up with all the equipment. He helped size me up for my arrows and allowed me to try the bow on the Range. I wanted to stick around and shoot some more hours so I got the $10 per hour range fee and will certainly come back. I'm also thinking of taking their classes which they offer given the positive experience I've had.</Text>< Pictures>

You will not find a more honest and knowledgeable archery store in California. Refreshing!!!
Spending more does not always equate to results. They take the time to fit you to the equipment that will give you the best results and fun out of Archery, indoor or outdoor, targets or hunting.
Thank you

The place is well maintained and neat. Good for first timers; the staff made sure we got the basics to enjoy the session.  They do have bathroom and it's very clean so if you are there longer it's convenient.  If you bring your own equipment the lane rental is cheaper. They also do sell equipment but I can't comment on that since I didn't buy any.< /Review>

I came to this store to outfit my daughter with a recurve Olympic style bow.  The owners are so good at helping to get the right stuff, and we were really happy with the outcome.  My daughter was able shoot the bow in their indoor range as the sale was evolving and she was able to try out several different things, like sights, arrows, and tip holders.  Overall a great experience.  The reason we went there is because I purchased a bow for myself 15 years prior at the same shop, and I knew they would treat us well.< /Review>

I've been going to Archery Only since The Bowrack in Richmond closed a few years back.  I'm from Richmond so it's a matter of convenience, but Archery Only is the last man standing. Turned out that going to Archery Only was a great step forward for me.  I've been shooting a bow for sixty years now and I've made huge improvements in the last few years.  Wayne and Roger at Archery Only got me fixed up with a fairly inexpensive Hoyt camo bow, and got me going with the .166 real skinny arrows; and then later, a matching left handed Hoyt -- my idea, to shoot both ways.  Total great support from the staff at Archery Only, for whatever you want to do.  And I don't even go bowhunting.  So Archery Only is totally recommended for anything you want to do shooting bow and arrow.  Anything.< /text>

<username>Joseph Orender<//username>< review>
Installed my strings quickly, but the peep is crooked, yokes are crooked, d loop could nock a hot dog, cams aren’t timed, and the felt was blown off my drop away rest. They also lost the peep that I had mailed in with my strings. Shot about 20 arrows and they are insanely nock high. Needs a lot of tuning now.

The guy behind the counter in the wolf shirt was literally complaining how much work he had and behind he was the entire three hours I waited. You work in an archery shop during bow season. The entire rest of the year is your vacation. He tied two peeps while I was there and they were both crooked and high. The people left with their bows.

Watching them operate a bow press was painful. The counter top was extremely messy and three people running around trying to restring bows and peeps. My bow was piled on top of another bow and I watched my quiver get scratched and limbs resting against some other persons equipment. I treat my gear like it cost 1,400 bucks for a bow. I expect the person handling it to do the same. Then a screw drops off the table and it’s lost. I had to wait while they found a replacement screw. Now my bow has a random screw in it. Sweet!

This should not be a Mathews dealer. If you are used to a shop like Reedys in Massachusetts that tunes world class bows on a daily basis for competition and then applies the same meticulous care and precision while tuning your hunting bow, this is not the place for you. When I get my bow strung, a “setup” is somewhat standard from most bow shops. A hardcore tune costs money. They offered neither.

Under qualified. Won’t be going back.<//review>

The shop also carries a bunch of accessories.  Lots of choices. Recurve and compound bows. Owners are also shooters and know their stuff. They also work on bows on-site and can do your arrows too. A go to place for your archery needs.  Open late so it is convenient. They offer lesson and rental.</Text>< Pictures>

Great and helpful staff, that doesn't mind taking their time to explain and have you try out the equipment.  They can also order any equipment not currently in stock.
I don't think they take reservations, so weekend nights may be tough to get a spot on the range.< /Review>

<Text>I took the Introduction to Archery class and got hooked immediately. I have since bought equipment there and found the store to be completely honest. They don't try to 'up-sell' at all. In fact, they try to keep people from wasting their money by buying equipment that they are not ready for. I'm now using the range when it is too cold or wet to shoot outdoors, and find that to be a great experience.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>An easy 0 out of 5 if I can! We were having a group of 10 to celebrate birthday party there. My 8 years boy only tried 1 arrow on my lane to test his strength but was charged extra full lane/hour price when we checked out. Staffs were sitting behind us, watching and nobody reminded us switching people could possibly against their rules of charging. This's nothing about money at that point. The staffs there were being so rude and show unrespectful in 30 mins argument with us, and still not willing to offer any discount for a kid who can't even tighten the bow. Even thought I still have 2 tickets left in my pocket, I would never be there again and recommend any of my friends this place, where they don't care about the customer experience at all. What a robbery and I fully understand now why the stadium was empty when we came in!!!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808fbf11ffc36875:0x7a8abc3d93a39dd6<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Editing my original response from a year ago:

Archery only is very knowledgeable.  That being said, they have the worst customer service, and everybody on staff has been extremely curt in almost every one of my experiences with them.

I will now go out of my way to find a store with better customer service, instead of being limited by a store wish such poor management.< /text></record>

<Review>This place is great.

Wayne, Roger and Willie are cool. I attended their Monday night class for 2 months and learn a lot. From - I don't know how to aim to now I can hit where I point... I have learned so much from them. They don’t look down on you and speak to me at a beginner level (you know some guys just have that attitude problem – not here!). Everyone is very knowledgeable with any archery equipment and gave me good advice of the good and bad of brand X vs. brand Y.

Facility is clean and convenience located (at least to me). I bought a used Compound Bow from CL and ask Roger to check for me - no complain at all (since I did not purchase from them).  They sell everything archery related items in house – I was like a kid in a candy store – wahoo!

I plan to join their beginner league later on, so that I can meet other shooters and improve my skill in archery.< /Review><UserId.>108565048423134361846< /UserId.>< Pictures>

I've been a customer of archery only for a couple decades and I've bought all of my compound bows there...and always will. I highly recommend AO for your first bow purchase. These compounds are very easy to pick up and shoot...but
1) they do require tuning and the expertise AO provides is valuable
2) Form is crucial in archery and AO will help get you started in the right direction

Consider this when reading bad reviews. I've been in the shop when folks bring in their bow they purchased from a online discounter and expect the guys in the shop to drop everything to help them on a bow they didn't sell...for free of course. Also consider that when dealing with your bow they have other folks trying to purchase stuff, etc...so being a small business they may not be able to devote all of their time to just your issue. With a little patience, they have always got me squared away and will to you too.< /Review>

Nice,  the sandal dish was great.  Have not had this dish in many years.  the cook let me watch her fold the beans into the tortilla as she pressed the masa.   100% a goto place</Text>

<review>Big portions of food.  Really good cemitas.  Might not look like it from outside, but one of the best places for home made food.  It says market on the outside but it's more a small restaurant than market. You can tell its not fast food style at all.  Always has people at the tables eating.</review>< gmap_id>

If the manager saw this he would not be happy I’ve worked at a restaurant before and the best advice I can give you is make sure the kitchen looks presentable ! This is unacceptable, also preparing the food without gloves seems very unsanitary, again this is experience from working in the kitchen don’t take it from me but it’s in the food handlers certificate , the food wasn’t bad but please make sure that the torta has lettuce that looks presentable not browning again I’m paying for the item , the tacos dorados seem like over cooked again not bad but these are things that a business needs to improve the kitchen< /Review>

Not a lot of options for diabetics but that's just a personal need. Not a lot of parking spots, theres more at the back but at night that feels dangerous.

(Translated by Google) They did not give me the complete order, and still the cemites they sell there are not the size they should, the size is a few mini hamburgers and very poorly prepared them, almost no cheese and meat they put, I really do not buy again in that place.

(Original)
No me entregaron la orden completa, y todavía las cemitas que venden ahí no son del tamaño que deberían, el tamaño es de unas mini hamburguesas  y bien pobre me las prepararon, casi nada de queso y carne le pusieron, la verdad no vuelvo a comprar en ese lugar.<//Review>

Delicious, best in area. They accept debit/credit. Conchas are made throughout day since they sell quickly. Croissants are savory and sweet. They also have good carrot bread and bolillo. Basically every bread is good. Great prices. Don’t go or you’ll become an addict and have to talk yourself out of going every day like my husband and I have to do.< /Text>

The conchas (I prefer the mini conchas, but both regularand mini are delicious), the croissants, empanadas, cookies, just everything is great!
Be prepared to wait in line, it's that busy.

Great bread at excellent prices! Every time I go there's an extra measure of precaution due to COVID 19.  Only easily accessible parking would make this place a 5. Parking is terrible.</Text>

The most delicious sweet bread I have ever eaten!  Literally Every type of bread is delicious. My favorite are the biscuit and the corn bread with cinnamon and sugar on top 😋 the prices are super affordable, the staff is friendly, and the bread is ALWAYS fresh and warm. Thank god I found this place 5 years ago when I moved to Montebello 🙏🏼</Text>

Was lied to by worker, place is always busy so I asked if I can place an order over the phone she said yes as long as it is the day before. So I call 24 hrs in advance only to be told it's not true. Great bread poor service or untrained employees.< /Review>

The 🍞 is fresh there's always a lot of people that it gets sold out soon that they have to put out more but what I see is that once they have a lot of clients they don't put their heart in the things they sell that happens every where you go. I like the bread better before they had a lot of customers</review>

The bread is soft and warm. The price of a concha ain't too bad either $.50 and $.30 for the small.  Bolillos are $.40 each and plastic bags are $.25 each
Delicious bread!!</text>

Lack of parking its messy , sadly lots of homeless  people by the entrance,  and outside of the front door its dirty , and smelly , otherwise  inside some good ladies attending  the place are very nice , the owner is never to be found or greet visitors the good ladies attending the place are overworked and underpaid God bless them , the owner sells Costco milk for over 5 dollars a gallon , while both gallons are the same price , what a thief</review>

The pan dulce here is amazing. Everything is always fresh. The only downside is that it gets super packed in there and the line to pay is sometimes really long. But it worth the wait if you have time.< /Text>

<text>Their pan dulce is ALWAYS fresh and good. I see a lot of people buying their coffee there. I love very strong coffee so I wasn't a fan of theirs. Their tamales are better than some of the other local places. Not great but good so I still buy them< /text><rating>4</rating></record>

This is one of the best bakeries I've been with the big bucket go have the greatest people that were very helpful and they make this really the nicest bread is usually always race they make it like four times a day different batches I recommended this is Daryl could you got to go and check it out yourself and you know what I'm talking about and their prices are so low and I never today for $3 you can get yourself almost a full bag of paper a paper bag full of sweet bread and tamales and I'm flying they also sell flan they have the best I ever tasted it before affordable to class they sell sandwiches and tamales</Review>

Arriving on a Saturday evening you get what's left....but what's left is delicious soft bread.  Bay Area needs to get a franchise out there.  I don't wonder why people r lined up n the parking lot.  It's worth the wait!  I'm going to try early morning .  It will be heaven😇 to taste bread warm from the oven.< /text>

Great pan dulce and prices are amazing! 5 star!!

I give this place a 3 star rating only because of customer service... if you dont speak spanish fluently the ladies kind of give you attitude and dirty looks... Parking is terrible since its in a very small plaza....but other than that great place for a sweet Mexican treat!< /review>

Unfortunately I had the worse experience we just came and asked for 100 little conchas for my uncles funeral today the cashier was very rude i was in shock ! she said we dont have any! in a bad way, the Baker heard and he said I will have them in 1 hour I said thank you to the Baker but the rude cashier said I cant take the order you have to come in 1 hour and see if we have some left!! I told her it's not hard for her to take my money and when thet are done I will pick them up, she said no if they are some left you can buy them ! shock! I asked for the manager in charge and no one was in charge i asked for the owner's number she ignored me ! If you dont want to be treated like this DO NOT SHOP THERE no matter what my mother says the bread is good but not good enough to get abused by the cashier its 10:30am on Friday June 14 I hope the owner reads this and either train the staff to be respectful to his customers or loose customers like us.< /Text>

I would think that you would have bread frsh and ready in the morning since thats when it gets busy.  Plus the bread they did have out looked old.  Won't be coming back here...will go back to my favorite El Gallo Bakery.< /Review>< gmap_id>

They're bread is FANTASTIC! One of my gavorite places in all of ELA. And I've had bread from alot of places in my 50 years+ living in the area. The bread is always fresh. I love the lil conchitas, the cup cakes, and the elotes, and they have the softest bolillos.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The bread is very tasty, but I give it 3 because if they already know that they sell a lot of bread, especially the horns and the shells, then one goes and there isn't.

(Translated by Google) The attention is the worst, those who attend only spend in the gossip, I went to buy a thread of Kings and only had medium and large and told me that the girls left in half an hour, I waited half an hour to be told which were medium, this was a mockery for those of us who were waiting, besides that the prices were a bit exaggerated, 36 the median and 50 the big

(Original)
La atención es de lo peor, las que atienden solo se la pasan en el chisme, fui a comprar una rosca de Reyes y solo tenían mediana y grande y me dijeron que las chicas salian en media hora, esperé la media hora para que me dijeran que eran medianas, esto fue una burla para los que estábamos esperando, además que los precios eran un poco exagerados, 36 la mediana y 50 la grande</Review>
