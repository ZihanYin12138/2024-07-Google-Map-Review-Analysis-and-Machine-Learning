Just went to Public Storage to check on my unit. A new manager was there named Josie. She was very pleasant. She informed me that she was now managing the site. Informed me of new changes and told about the new Public Storage App. She was very helpful.<//Text>

<name>Jackie Cazares</name><review>I was already shaken up before coming into the postal office. Some police stuff was happening outside and I got scared. I went inside and the clerk that was helping me was very rude. I had to go fix a mistake and this lady told me that the clerk had been very nasty to me. I made line again and I had her as a clerk once again. At this point I was very nervous. I had made a mistake again and had to fix it but she wasn’t patient about that. So I stepped aside and aloud her to help another customer. She was rude to the other client as well. After that customer, she finally helped me and I was able to send my package. But she was very rude. Her name is Helen.< /review>< Pictures>

<date>1616644989104< /date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I really wish I could give the Vacaville beach of USPS 0 stars. Not necessarily the customer service location - but the mail carriers are awful. When we purchased our home, our neighborhood's mail carrier was great. He was consistent and easy going. 11/10 good guy. Unfortunately, he is no longer serving our neighborhood. The lady we have now is awful. We haven't gotten our mail in over a week because of the mail box location... which is outside of our gate. She states that she was scratched by our dogs; however, the layout and height of the gate (4+ feet tall, 3 inches wide) makes that impossible. Further we have cameras on the house and have yet to see a video where the dogs were able to make any contact with her whatsoever. We will be filing an official complaint. Vacaville residents - be cautious. They can apparently hold your mail hostage with no proof of any wrongdoing on your part.</text>< Pics>

Everytime I come in here the staff is rude and condescending. They do not seem to like their jobs and treat everyone as though they are an inconvenience. They treat me like I should know everything about the postal service but I do not, which is why I come to get help to be sure I am doing what I need to to send packages. I have had many different employees and everyone has been the same in their treatment. They are usually pretty busy and do move at a fairly good pace, which is the only thing good I have to say, but this does not make up for how they treat the people.<//Review>

It's completely understaffed for the amount of daily patrons, so is always super busy. It might not be so bad, but then they always have one worker going through the lobby asking about what services you need...only to have the workers at the counter ask the same questions. Whoever came up with this idea of taking a perfectly capable employee away from their duties, is obviously someone who promoted well past their level of competence!! It's so wasteful and literally saves no time. Put the employee back behind the counter and let's see how much faster the line moves.< /Review>< Resp>

I am so appreciative of the great customer service here. Lisa was a friendly face and great attitude, and supervisor Bhupi was out helping customers with boxes, packaging, and answering questions throughout my extending time here.

Literally the best Post Office visit I’ve ever had. Thank you all for making this easy!<//Review>

If possible, skip the line and utilize prepaid shipping and drop off service. Or schedule carrier pick up from your location for free.

The staff is super friendly and works hard. Over the holidays, they did such an amazing job!<//text>

I received a key inside my (cluster) mailbox with instructions to retrieve my parcel from the larger (cluster) box below...only the key does not unlock either of the two boxes...I call the next morning and explain the above. I request that the carrier leave "notice" I will pick up at P.O. when I arrive home in the afternoon...still there is no (yellow) "notice" left inside my mailbox...I call again someone else answers and says if your home now I will just have the carrier come back to your home and deliver...I'm still waiting...I called again (3rd X) the initial supervisor states that it's a "sub" carrier and he was out till 10:00 pm yesterday after I stated that I would come down to pick up my package near closing time. Really 10pm is after dark AND possibly illegal, but definitely dangerous for the carrier AND a huge liability for the P.O. I rate this office MINUS 1 star< /Text>

I'd give it a 0 stars of I could. No one is answering. I received a notice in my mailbox that I either have to get my package re delivered or pick it up. I have been up since 6am. No one has come to my door or knocked at all. I have been very careful about staying next to the door. They claim they tried to deliver my package today but that isn't possible. I've had my blinds open and looking out of them all day. I got this delivery so it would be fast for a birthday party. And now I am told I have to pick it up myself during the time when I should be at a party two hours away.</Text>

<text>Very unprofessional. On occasion, in the past 5 years a few representatives at the counter have actually offered a smile and small talk...again, on a occasion. Overall going to this Office is a disappointment. I try hard to avoid needing them at all but unfortunately getting our mail is important.  My most recent experience was with a male "Supervisor " that in my opinion, needs to re-visit customer service training or be held accountable for setting a poor example of how to build strong long term customer relationships within a community. To say he was rude might be a blanket term because there was definitely a few layers of very surprising and off putting responses he gave. Let's start with making eye contact with your customer and one word responses work for animals, not people. I might also suggest not "barking" at your employee or "trainee" ... I wasn't quite sure since she seemed to be some what confused at his request. Now maybe they don't feel there is a problem with the said professional level at this branch but from a customer perspective I have continued to see the same level of head shaking behavior since 2012. Very low level follow up or follow through and if your not on top of any issues yourself they will drag them out beyond a reasonable timeline. If you say today or tomorrow, let that be the case. Not require me to call for follow up 3 days later to be told tomorrow again. It's frustrating to say the least. I love UPS and even FEDEX. I'll be doing all the business I can with them and continuing to avoid this office. It was pretty sad giving this review. I hope things change.<//text>< Response>

Have been getting the wrong mail delivered to our house for 2 years now, my neighbors are getting my mail, and I've complained (as have my neighbors) numerous times to no avail. The mail that is getting mixed up is important mail, my credit card statements, my license for work, I've gotten legal documents (social security, etc) that were supposed to be sent to my neighbors. All of this is information that can easily lead to identity theft, and I'm sick of it. How hard is it to deliver mail to the correct address?< /text>

ABSOLUTELY THE WORST US POST OFFICE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! The building itself is fine, but the service is terrible! The manager and the lady that "helped" me were rude and didn't know their own job. It is worth the drive to go somewhere else even with gas over $4.00 per gallon.< /Text>

They workers have never been rude to me personally, but I was incredibly shocked to hear how some of them talk about each other. Openly gossiping about other employees to the customers and workers. Although I am a pretty hard person to offend, I will say that some of the female employees lack a certain endearing customer service quality.<//Text>

Don't make a line for stamps only then put someone there who's going to go on break & leave people still waiting in the line & not tell anyone. I stood there waiting for the guy to come back for several minutes before a woman asked if I was told to stand there. I said no but I was in line before the guy walked off. Thats when I was informed that he went to break. I walked out!< /text>

The clerks are thieves.....  .I well never patronize this place ever....the clerk with the big wig like hair really was charging me 20 dollars then gave me a hard time about taping the car seat starps...telling me I have to buy tape...so I went outside did my magic.....went to a different clerk  and the price changed almost by 10 dollars so if you go there get a second opinion or you will be overcharged

<review>Prepurchase postage from the kiosk or using the internet and things go much, much quicker. Otherwise, due to volume- as with all post offices- there's usually a line at peak hours (like the grocery store, bank, restaurant, etc). Staff has always been friendly and helpful.

Those of you wishing for everybody to be fired- jeez. Have some compassion. My average post office trip is less than 10 minutes. Pre plan or use the kiosk- it covers most of the transactions you'd need at the post office. If everybody did that, there would be no line!

FYI- postage is cheaper through many services on the internet as well. Those of you standing in line are stuck in the past and it's costing you time and money.< /review>< Response>

I really dislike that the hours have been changed to 9:30 from 8am.. to open. I also hate when an employee goes thru the line asking people what they are there for, instead of opening another cash register to help us.. instead of asking us exactly what the next teller will ask.. :(</Text>

No one at 200 Demarest drive,  Vacaville. Ca. 95687,  is getting the right mail. It's A mess!  Credit cards are missing,  bills are past due, wrong mail in wrong mailboxes.  This has been happening,  since November, 2015!<//Text>

The supervisor needs to have the employee's to come back to the post office so they can go home and not stay out late you start your shift and end of the shift the supervisor needs to be fired when you call the post office they need to answer the phone right away who agrees with me....!!!!!!!< /Text>

<review>two days ago was the first time we went to this good restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We enjoyed the evening a lot with the excellent service, with the superb  meal and wine and with the decent payment. We will absolutely come back in a short time.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I had a wonderful dinner! I had fresh off the boat salmon (amazing and local), amazing wine, and lets face it...amazing bread too! The service was fast and very friendly. We ate on a warm evening, so they had there huge windows open, which was a nice touch because it gave airflow. I recommend eating here.<//Review>

I do not know where to begin nor how to describe the meal that my friends and I had! The plate called Meyer Lemon Fettuccine with Fresh Seafood with White Sauce was PHENOMENAL!! It was thee best pasta I had ever tried. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I was so concerned with how much was being added with the many varieties of seafood in the dish that I was worried that flavors would clash. This dish by far was our table’s favorite meal. All 6 of us were craving for more as we shared it amongst ourselves. The Risotto was surprisingly unique with it having the appearance being only creamy but to have such an enjoyable crunch with every bite. You would not have expected such a delicacy to fool you in such a pleasant way. We ordered a Peppered Steak cooked medium rare and it was seared just right where the outside was cooked well and the center remained pink with the glaze keeping you mesmerized with every bite. This place truly was 5 stars and the service was too.<//Review>

A neighborhood gem of mine that never disappoints!   Good food, good service and reasonably priced.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I dare you to pick something from the menu blindfolded and report back your food experience.  I double dare you...</Text>

Fradelizio's is our standby place to go when we want a delicious dinner, great service, easy parking, and friendly atmosphere. The food is consistently good. There is some variation on the menu from week to week and season to season. The wine list features a few organic wines, and the service is friendly and efficient. It is one of the few places open late in the evening in Marin, which is another bonus.< /Text>< user>

Best part of the dinner was the bread.  With a reservation we waited and watched 2 walk ins be seated before us. The bolognese sauce was bland and my husband's chicken parmesan was cold when we were served 45 minutes after being seated. The staff were nice and friendly just not planning on going back.</Review>

So first time coming here, first of all the service at this place is super friendly, our waiter was super nice & told us what dishes are the best, i ordered spaghetti with meatballs, super good, the meatballs were super tender, the bread they serve at each table is super fresh, & the pasta is to die for. For dessert we ordered a scope of spumone so good, i am definitely coming back to this place again!</review>

<text>I've been coming here since I was a tiny child. The food is always amazing, the service extraordinary, and everyone is family. Paul frequently has a book to loan my parents, I've often seen customers getting hugs goodbye as they leave, and the smiles on everyone's faces are genuine.

It can be a little loud for date night, but if you don't mind everyone around you heartily enjoying themselves, I'd not hesitate to tell you to bring a first (or second, or seven hundredth) date. Families are always welcome, too, and small children are fond of the penny candy machine near the door. I had my wedding dinner here when my late husband and I eloped, and it was a joy to celebrate my wedding with the restaurant I've grown up with.

Try the house red, anything on the specials list, the Roman Holiday salad, and the gnocchi. Nothing on the menu will disappoint, but those are my favorites.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Delicious food, awesome service and hospitality. Found this little gem after a day hike at Point Reyes and Kehoe beach.
Such a lovely surprise how good the items on the menu tasted.
Will definitely go back and recommend.<//Text>

Surprisingly good and better than we expected from reading reviews. The meat Cannelloni not only had wonderful thin tender home made crepes wrapping them but also had a red sauce with cream that made it the best I've ever tasted!  Bread had the crispy, crunchy crust it should, the house salad was great, and the Tiramisu was about as good as it gets.  My espresso was accompanied with a couple of home made biscottis which also were terrific. We custom ordered our chicken Picatta with a breaded and fried cutlet, which our super friendly and attentive server Christina accommodated us with cheerfully, and savored the fairly strong lemon caper sauce.  All in all we enjoyed everything about our dinner and felt comfortable and welcomed even as returning home from a day on Stinson Beach.  We definitely recommend this cozy restaurant and can't wait to go back!< /review>

I'm a local and this is my favorite Italian restaurant.  Try any of the specials with wild boar (cannelloni, ravioli, or ragu).  Great with either white or the wonderful house red.  Veal saltimbocca is wonderful and any of the seafood dishes.

This friendly place is very popular on weekends, so maybe make a reservation at peak times.  Or you can stroll around Fairfax while waiting for your table.<//Text>

Pretty good food and atmosphere, overall a good experience. For the quality it is a little bit pricy. Tables are very small and dining area is a little but crowded. Servers are good and very friendly.< /review>

<response>None<//response><Review>I hate to seemingly be the only person on earth who has a negative review to post. My mother and I have been a bit disappointed the past 4 times we ate at Fradelizio's, but kept going back because we love the atmosphere. After a while your memory fades and you forget why you had been disappointed the last time you were there.
It is very cozy and inviting and the staff is always very friendly and accommodating.  My mother ordered the Carbinara. The menu lists this dish as simply 'Carbinara'. No description at all, so when the dish arrived not at all what we excepted, it was a bit of a let down. Carbinara is most commonly made with bacon or panceta, and eggs tossed in. This was instead a creamy mushroom Carbinara, and if there was any bacon in it all, you couldn't tell. Not very tasty.
I ordered the Shrimp Scampi. The menu describes the wine garlic butter sauce...but makes no mention at all about the penne pasta with marinara sauce that is served along side of the shrimp. So there is two major sauces served, together on the same plate, running together. Not good. I had hoped for rice along with the scampi, which is most commonly offered.
Afterwards we ordered each a Cappuccino. Although it is served with a small but very tasty biscotti along side, even this was a disappointment. The Cappuccino was very weak in flavor, and luke warm!  (I remember it being this way last time also.)
For the price we paid, we left feeling very underwhelmed. Love the ambiance, love the friendliness...but I don't think we'll be going back any time soon.</Review>< username>

Neat little place. We didn't have a reservation, since it was one of those last minute decisions after a long hike, but got a table less than a minute later. My son had their Lasagna and I ordered the Gnocci with pancetta and mushooms. Both dishes were amazing. Service was fast and very friendly.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>My experience with K-9 Companions is an A++.  Diane and her team of professional trainers worked to take my two overly indulged labradoodle puppies and after a matter of weeks, delivered them home as well mannered dogs who solidly knew 5 basis commands. Our 10 month old female puppy and her 5 month old male puppy sibling were, and still are, an absolute pleasure to have in the house. We could not be happier or more appreciative of the quality training, caring atmosphere and the excellent value. K-9 Companions reliably delivers what they promise and for a fair price to boot.  Thank you Diane and Scott! I highly recommend your company and your services!!</text>< name>

Wow! Where do I even start! We love our Girl, but man...She is now the most obedient puppers we’ve ever had thanks to K-9 Companions Dog Training, our love is on overload for her now!! She sits, stays, comes on command, walking on a leash is now a breeze, goes to her crate/place when asked and stays there, isn’t chewing up things, bullying the cats, knows her boundaries and what areas she can’t cross... all around beautiful trained girl, I could not be more thankful for their amazing job and their even more amazing staff! We loved how her Trainer, Nova, came by the house and refreshed Our girl on her skills, we are so grateful for all she has been taught at this place, we highly recommend friends!< /Review>

<review>Recently had my 2 dogs, Ginger and Lando attend the bootcamp at K9 companions. We were so happy with the results. Our dogs came back well mannered, and calmer. They even worked with my husbands wheelchair and training the dogs to walk with him and the wheelchair. I will be sending my dogs back for the board and brush up program they have here too!!!</review><resp>None< /resp><Rating>5<//Rating><Time>1622568644567< /Time><Name>Christel Gibbins< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I went for our consultation and I'm very happy with the location, the atmosphere so peaceful and perfect. I have a young adult with Autism and just seeing his reaction when Diane spoke and how he felt at the location, very happy and at peace,  and for him to say yes my dog can stay here for his training, that's a miracle. That shows how good my son feels overall. We decided as a family that our English Lab will do his training at K9 Companions.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Worth EVERY penny! Went in for our consultation and we we’re treated like family. The entire staff is so welcoming. Even gave us tips that we could immediately put into play at home, while waiting for his checkin date, to establish boundaries with our other dog.

We decided on the 2 week bootcamp for our Dawkins. Our once hyper pup in 2 weeks transformed into a well obedient dog!

We are so pleased by the service and professionalism provided. Walks are enjoyable, boundaries are in place at home, commands are being followed.

Thanks to Helena and entire team for taking great care of our boy and training him in ways we only dreamed of.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Love this place. My dog has gone through their beginning boot camp. I was at the dog park today. With all the distraction and without a training collar on, she listened to every command I gave her. So proud of Izzy and grateful to K9 Companions and their amazing staff.< /review>

<text>We couldn't be more happier with the experience our Ben had at K9 Companions during puppy boot camp. The staff was kind, smart, friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The grounds were clean, well kept and large. Our Ben arrived and was very timid and shy. The friendly and helpful staff greeted him slowly and won him over immediately.
When we picked up Ben after the two weeks, he was happy, energetic and excited to show us all he learned. Walking him before boot camp was not as enjoyable as it is now. Ben is much more obedient now and we are enjoying him more than ever. We love taking him to restaurants since we know he will can be trusted to stay in a "down/stay" command while we enjoy our meal.
We have had our in home visit and took advantage of the training time we have at the facility as well. When we travel it is so nice to know when we drop him off to be boarded, he will also receive more training. Ben loves seeing the trainers and staying with them while we are on vacation. The facility is a little over an hour drive for us and totally worth it. We will forever be grateful for all the training and endless help we receive from K9.< /text>< Pics>

I had a wonderful experience with K-9 Companions. They are very caring of my puppy Penny Lane, Penny for short.  Love how professional they are in caring and training Penny while she was at their facility. Penny was able to graduate from K9 Boot camp and now we have to get her to pass the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) before returning for her 2nd  phase of training to become my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Mobility Service Dog. KUDOS to Diane Vaughn (Manager), and Shelby Taylor (Penny's trainer). I highly recommend this organization to anyone that would need to have their dogs trained or boarded.<//review>

My fur baby's 2 weeks boot camp is so amazing.  I have seen a lot of changes on her, it really helps a lot!  The price i paid is worth!

All the staff are awesome, friendly and always ask questions if you have any concerns.  The trainers are all good, they know what they are doing.

They had helped my baby a lot.  I will save money again for the next level!  Can't wait to see my fur baby for more training,

Thanks K-9 Companions!</Review>

K-9 Companions - what a great place!   The staff loves dogs and it shows in everything they do from their interactions, cleanliness and training techniques.   The facility is very clean, well maintenance and just beautiful.   Tucker, our boxer, after only one boot camp is a new dog - more behaved, focused and trainable.   We look forward to continuing our training with K-9 Companion.   Beverly and Kory Andrew</Text>

Although I was worked with also by the good people of K-9 Companions so that I ended up as refined as my dog. Our life together is more pleasant and easier with the training he received. It goes far beyond being referred to as "obedience school". I have no doubt that every dog could benefit from the expertise exhibited by the trainers at K-9 Companions.

After losing our beloved older female Husky, we adopted a two-year female Husky from the animal shelter.  After bringing her home, the sweet dog that we met at the animal shelter suddenly became a holy terror.  Not only was she driving our older male Husky crazy, she was biting and chewing on everything including us.  After three weeks of canine craziness, we contacted K-9 Companions and immediately enrolled Sierra in the three-week Boot Camp.  Now after attending Boot Camp and several follow-up lessons, we are proud to say that Sierra is truly part of our family.  K-9 Companions not only trained Sierra but they provided us with the instruction and tools to become the "Alpha" that she loves and respects.  The staff is great and we would like to special kudos to Shelby and Danielle for all their tips and insight over the last several months.  We highly recommend K-9 Companions.< /text>

I brought our newly rescued very angry/frightened 90 pound German Sheppard in for a 30 minute evaluation and the trainer was able to show me that she had never been abused and was eager to learn and very trainable. The trainer said this could be done by weekly training or in two weeks of boot camp and we choose the Boot Camp. Two weeks later we picked up a very happy very obedient dog who is really fun to be around. The price of the Boot Camp includes a training session at our home as well as six training sessions during the next year at the facility. We are thrilled with the follow up. And instead of having to pay for someone to play with her during boarding K9 Companions will board her and train her free of charge every day she's there as a brush up. This is a win-win situation for everyone! Thanks!<//Text>

I heard about this training facility from a friend and I was impressed with the outcome for their dog.  So I needed to get my dogs trained and we   chose K-9 Companions and we are very impressed with their methods of training and the progress our dogs have made.  Vanessa, one of our dogs trainers, was very good with demonstrating what they had accomplished after two weeks and she was very gentle but firm with her corrections when they did not perform well at first.  We highly recommend their facility and their training methods.< /text>

I have a new German Shepherd puppy that was in serious need of basic training because of his extremely high energy. I live alone which made the desire to have him under control even more of a necessity. When he was too young to get a rabies shot (14 weeks old) I found a private trainer that would accept him for 3 week basic obedience and keep him separate from any other dogs (full shots are a necessary requirement). That did help some and gave him a decent head start, but the results after a lot of $$ and 3 weeks away from my new puppy were not everything that is advertised, which is generally the same for most puppy “boot camps”. When he was a couple months older with all of his shots and much more work with him on my own at home, I decided to look for a more comprehensive training facility and was recommended K-9 Companions from somebody at the doggie day care he goes to. When I took him in for evaluation I anticipated that he would be going to the intermediate/off leash, 2nd level program. He was way ahead of the game from a first timer but not up to the standards K-9 Companions expects after their 1st level of obedience. He had to brush up and advance his basic training (sit, stay, heel, down, come, no, off...) for one week and was able to move on to the next level for the next 2 weeks. He came back a different dog! Still as sweet and playful as he had been from day 1, but he obeyed everything he was taught as if he was having fun doing it. When I take him for walks or anyone comes to the house, every single person who meets him can’t believe how well behaved he is for such an energetic puppy. I have even recommended to several people that they take their misbehaving or untrained adult dogs to K-9 Companions for at least basic obedience. I am certain that it has done as much for my dog’s quality of life as it has for my own enjoyment of him, and believe that would be true for any dog owner/parent. After a couple more months at home with me, he does SO well and enjoys working on everything he has learned so much, I decided to put him through more advanced training. I had already taken him back for short boarding and brush up training and he absolutely loves the staff, as they do him. No separation anxiety at all (I may have a little:) and he was genuinely excited to be back. There was no hesitation at all as the quality of the facility and the care he is given there is top notch. In researching dog training facilities the first thing reviewers and experts say is to do your homework on the facility, they are not all equal. I am 100% comfortable knowing my baby is in great hands at K-9 companions. He is currently there as I’m writing, going through his off-leash and advanced training. I could not recommend this facility and their staff any more than saying my dog is now on his third stay there and I know he is loving it as much as I will be when he comes home. The follow up training that is included has been invaluable more in the sense of training ME than my dog. He knows exactly what to do, it’s up to me to know how to properly communicate with positive reinforcement. This training is worth every penny and will pay back dividends with years of enjoyment for both you and your dog. I have owned many dogs throughout my life and never had one formally trained. I thought they were so smart (they were) but had never realized their full potential. I thought my own training that only came from years of repetition was enough. I had no idea the difference professional training would make and am now a firm believer that if anybody has the means to do it, like me they would consider it a necessity.< /text>

<user_name>Gabrielle farrell< /user_name><Text>We love k9 companions! We were challenged with having a wild husky puppy that continued to outsmart us and we didn’t know what to do. We knew we didn’t want to get rid of him but his behavior was a lot to handle and we couldn’t even take him on walks to get his energy out because he would drag us down the street. We came across K9 companions and after meeting with the friendly office staff decided that the best thing for him would be sending him to their 3-week training. It was hard to have him gone for 3 weeks but we are SO thankful and happy we went through with the decision. During the process, they had multiple trainers work with him and they keep them on a very consistent schedule. After the 3 weeks were up and it was time to pick him up we could immediately see how much he had learned and how much more obedient he was. Then they ran us through all of the commands in order to teach us how to work with him. The biggest part of the training process is to continue to train your dog daily in your home and they made it easy for us to learn what we needed to do. As part of the K9 companions program that we choose an instructor came out to our house about a month (might have been a couple weeks… cant remember) after we brought him home and went through all of the training with us again. To follow up on the training, as part of the package they also offered 8 monthly 1- on-1 training classes with us at their facility. Although it was hard to take our husky in an hour car ride each way it was totally worth it and this was a huge key to the success of having our husky trained. Not only did it keep us accountable but also allowed us to refresh our skills. There is no quick fix in having a trained dog and it is a lot of work but if you are willing to put in the effort I highly, highly, highly recommend working with K9 companions. All of their instructors are extremely knowledgeable, patient, and friendly. I can happily say that I can easily take my husky on walks with him heeling, he knows his name, knows how to sit, stay, come, laydown, he knows that he isn’t allowed on the bed/couch and he will even wait for us to give him the “ok” to walk through doors. Our husky is now almost two and continues to test us daily but we are thankful to K9 companions for getting him to a place where he listens to us.</Text><response>None< /response><Time>1518466955840< /Time>< Rate>

K9 Companions is truly second to none. I have been in the dog boarding/ training business for twenty years and I know a good place when I see one. I have also been a student in their trainers course and have spent seven weeks at the facility so I have first hand knowledge on how the business operates and how they treat the dogs. The staff is extremely friendly and professional, the facility is always clean, and the dogs well-being is always first priority.  Karen, the owner, has always been extremely friendly and always there to answer any questions that I have had. I have had many of my own dogs and my family's dogs trained by K9 Companions, and I have never had any problems or complaints. If you are looking for the best training facility in Southern California look no further.<//Review>

<Name>Jonathan Welsher</Name><Review>[This review is edited. I have since used their services and have added to this review! See the bottom.]

I used their service for my Great Pyrenees which is known to be a stubborn breed as it pertains to training. Upon his return he was completely leash trained, would stop at all doors and gates to be let in or out by me, but definitely the best thing was his manners. He would seem to want to understand what I wanted him to do and when he did it made him noticeably more happy.

I'm giving this place a 10/10! My only small gripe is the price but I am a firm believer in getting what you pay for.
------------------------------------------------
Old review:
I am considering this location for my Great Pyrneese. While I haven't used them personally , I have had friends with multiple dogs use their services. Having witnessed the difference I would say that you could trust this place. I will update my review once I get my pup through the training there.

Also, if you read a negative review, check out that person's review history. If they have a tendency to write negative ones it's probably a sign that they're unhappy somewhere else in life and aren't considering that businesses suffer from negative reviews; especially ones that are unwarranted.<//Review><date>1537124095644</date><rating>5</rating><UserId.>106718334031651070793< /UserId.></record>

It was a little more that we felt we could handle on our own. So we put him in the boot camp. What we got back was a happy, calm,  well adjusted member of our family. Honestly like night and day. But we are even happier to take him back a month later for the first of his onsite long leash training.  He jumped out of the car, tail wagging a mile a minute. When he saw his trainer, he was so excited, he broke training and jumped up to greet her. All the time he was working with us, he was eager to please, focused on getting it right.We love this dog, and want him to be a member of our family for a very long time.; K-9, all the great staff made it possible.  We are confident if any problems arise that we can't handle, they will get Percy and  most importantly, us on the right track. Thank you, Thank you. Money well spent.

We just picked up our 6 month labradoodle from Boot Camp.  I could not be happier with the results.  She no longer jumps on the children and is following all her commands.  I feel confident that she will now be a wonderful companion to our family.  I look foreword to the in-home training to help reinforce her behavior.  I would recommend K-9 Companions to anyone who would like help setting boundaries with their pet.< /Review>

I have three clients that have taken their puppies for training here and all were extremely happy with the training and the service they have gotten from K-9 Companions. One had previously gone to another local trainer and was unhappy with the results, needless to say they were thrilled after their dog came back from three weeks at K-9 Companions, he was happy, healthy and well trained. I will not hesitate to send other clients their way for training.< /Text>

I have dealt with K-9 Companions since the early 80's and have always been impressed with the professionalism, cleanliness and friendly staff. The trainers and owners go way and beyond what's expected to make sure that you are happy and in the end you have an obedient and well trained dog. I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else. DM<//text>

I think it is important for anyone considering a free consultation at K-9 Companions to understand that the reason for the consultation is to evaluate the dogs temperament and the needs of both the dog and the client. Some dogs need to see a veterinarian for medical or temperament issues due to medical issues prior to training. Some people wish to train their dogs in a manner that is as inexpensive as possible and therefore need to spend more time being involved in the training themselves (such as driving to the facility weekly) and not boarding the dog while training. Other clients prefer to have as much as possible done for them and would prefer to board the dog (costs more) and have as much of the training as possible done for them. Some dogs actually need this level of training due to a lack of socialization or due to them being fearful or aggressive. There is no way that a trainer can tell an owner over the phone what the dog is going to need. This is why the consultation is FREE. The training prescribed could be as little as a (local) in home lesson for $100.00. It could be lessons at the facility for $250-$495. The client might want lessons done in their home (at a higher cost) or they might want the Mercedes of dog training which involves the dog staying (boarding) at the facility, followed by lesson/s in their home and a number of follow up lessons over the next year at the facility.<//Text>

Love this place.  We checked it out before having out little chihuahua attend bootcamp, and came out with a great feeling. These people love dogs and know what they are doing.

We had kaptain in for 3 weeks, and his whole attitude has changed.  He is way better behaved.  Still stubborn but much better than before.

thanks</review>

<Text>I just got off the phone with Karen at canine companions.  As always, staff is pleasant, kind and accommodating.   I made a new appointment for our German Shephard for controlled aggression training.  This will be his third time at the center, and we would not drive 90 minutes for training/boarding if we were not completely satisfied with our prior experiences.  Leo completed basic training about 4 years ago, then off leash training last year, and now we're hoping to take him to the next level.    I was surprised to see a few really bad reviews about this place and felt compelled to write my own.  I don't normally write reviews, but I also never get very excited about any business.  This is a great place to train your dog and I highly recommend them.</Text>< date>

<text>I took my lab puppy to this facility for basic training. Upon checking in your dog; they do a health inspection. i was told that my dog had bloat and would die if I didn't take her to the vet right away. I left in tears took her to the vet to find there was nothing wrong with my dog. I called this training facility and told them that my dog was completely healthy and their vet had misdiagnosed my dog. Not to my surprise their health inspected is not even a certified veterinarian. I made the decision to put my dog through the training program that they offered. I was happy with the results of the training and liked the trainer they worked with her. Recently I took my dog back because we were going on vacation and they offer a boarding and brush up training for their stay. When I called to book the reservation I was told the price per day that there was a seven day minimum stay and that I needed to give a 50$ deposit to hold her spot. I told the staff that I would be gone 9-13 days and asked if there would be any issues if I had to pick her up a little earlier than 13 days. I was told there would be no problem with that. I dropped my dog off on the first paid in full for 13 days and called on the 3rd to let them know I would be picking her up on the 10th. Upon my return I was told that they would not refund my money for the 3 days she was not staying but I would get a credit for the money I had paid up front. I asked the staff for a copy of the agreement I had signed that stated that was the terms of our agreement. They could not provide me with one. I was then notified by management that if I wanted a partial refund of the 3 day boarding fee the contract would be voided and my dog would not be welcome to complete her training program. The amount in dispute is 134$ after I had paid them over 2000K. K-9 Companions staff have such poor business practice that they will upset a client over such a minimum amount and can not even provide Prof of this so called no refund policy.<//text>< username>

This wasn't good enough for her.  She then attempted to charge back for her ENTIRE stay meaning that she was trying to take back funds for services that WERE rendered to her dog.  Regarding the bloat issue, she was not told her dog was bloating.  She was told her dog's stomach was distended and it should be checked.  She actually agreed and said that it never normally looked that large.  Did she really not want us to point out something that could have been an issue?"}<//Response></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>teresa potts</user_name><Time>1423855400813<//Time><rate>5</rate><text>I read all the reviews about k-9 companions and I do not believe what everyone has to say about this place.  I decided to take my puppy in for puppy training as he is a handful.  I put him in the 3 week training course and when I picked him up he learned how to sit, stay walk on a lease all basic training.  He looked really good and clean when we picked him up.  We went over all his commands with the trainer.  by reading some of the reviews on yelp, and other sites people do not understand that training a dog takes not only a trainer but the owner of the dog to help with the training.  When your dog comes home it is up to the owner to make sure that dog keeps training on what he has learned at the training camp.  When you pick up your dog please do not think he is fully trained, it will take more than a couple weeks and you need to spend time with your dog and training.  I picked my puppy up and yes he walks by your side, sits when you stop, but there are times he get distracted and will not listen.  I work with my puppy every day on what he has learned and he is doing great.  I am taking Tiny back for 8 days while I am out of town and I know he will be getting a brush up on his training.  I could have kept him home with my daughter but she would not be able to over see his puppy training since she has a child of her own to care for and that could be a set back for his basic training.  I have good faith that Tiny is in good hands.  Love the place and the personnel that work there.  Thank You guys great job.< /text>< Pictures>

<userid>112801446354151481411</userid><text>VERY DISAPPOINTING!

We live in San Diego (100 miles away), so we called K-9 Companions to get information.  I spoke with 'K.a.r.e.n'.  She gave me info and quoted me a price between $595-995 (max).

When we got there - the price had nearly trippled!!! (now it's $1699).

We wasted 3 hours in the car (plus 1 hour waiting for them because they were behind on appointment times) for a total of 4.5 hours wasted, all because they were deceiving to us on the phone, to get us in the door.

If you are considering this facility - you better think again.  They have hidden fees like you would not believe.</text>< pictures>

<username>Karina J</username><review>Catie duffy, this place has been infected with this terrible virus for many years, 6 years ago I worked for a local veterinarian. We constantly treated dogs that came from k-9 companions infected with the pnemonia or influenza. Something is not right with this location. I wouldnt recomment this place to anyone. Maybe the training is good, personaly I wouldnt know, but the facility is infected and they lied to you about there unknowns. Its too bad making money is a priority over the health of there customers. They should have covered all your costs.<//review>< GmapID>

For your information we have only had to take 1 dog to the vet in the past year and a half and it wasn't for anything that we caused.

<Review>My family and I were in the process of moving into a new home in Lake Arrowhead and decided that our 10 month old Chesapeak Bay Retriever, Hank, needed formal training. We met with Dianne for our consultation and she assured me when Hank was done with boot camp that he would be an extremely well behaved young pup.We dropped Hank off August 2 and would be picking him up on August 23rd.

9 days into doggy training (August 11th), I received 4 back to back phone calls from a blocked number. I had my wife call and K9 Companions said Hank wasn't looking well so they took him to the vet. About an hour after they brought him back from the vet, they called saying we needed to pick him up immediately and take him to our vet. When we picked Hank up, he couldn't stand up and could barely lift his head. I had to carry him. You could tell he was extremely ill.

I took him to our local vet and the Dr took one look at Hank and said this is extremely concerning. He did X-rays and ran a parvo test. Hank came back negative for parvo and didn't have any foreign bodies lodged in his stomach but he had fluid in his lungs and was running a high fever. The vet told me, if I do not take Hank to the 24/7 emergency vet in Ontario, that Hank would not make it through the night.

I rushed Hank down the mountain and he was admitted immediately on the spot. The vet told me that Hank was in extremely rough shape and there is a chance he will not see the following morning.

Hank spent 5 days at the emergency vet with 24/7 care. Fortunately, he pulled through. He contracted a viral infection, a bacterial infection, para influenza and developed and pneumonia. Our total medical bills were over $6,000. The vet said he contracted it from this place.

K9 Companion assured us that they have never seen a case like this and that there have been no other cases of dogs getting this sick. The K9 companion staff seemed to be concerned about Hank the entire time, until it was time to talk about the bill. Dianne, the manager, was extremely worried about Hank and genuinely cared about Hanks health. She presented all the findings and bills to the owner. The owner, Laura said, there will be no reimbursement for Hanks medical bills.

K9 Companions is responsible for almost killing my dog and burying me in a financial hole. My wife stays at home with our 16 month old son. I am the sole provider. I am an Operation Enduring Freedom Veteran and still serve in the military. Our bills are worth two months of pay and we still have to take Hank in to be checked frequently to make sure his lungs have 100% recovered.

Once Hank returned home we had multiple vet visits and required attention at all times from my wife. We had to cancel a family vacation that was planned due to this nightmare. After 4 weeks of being on 3 different types of medication, having to doing breathing treatments, under constant supervision and having to be extremely careful with him, our puppy is starting to act like himself again. We are so thankful for the 24 hour Vet that saved our dogs life.

Bottom line is, do not take your dog here unless you want to deal with what we have dealt with. Morality has taken a back seat to these people and all they care about are pure profits.

***I have been in contact with another dog owner that had a similar experience as us. If you have had something similar to this, please get into contact with us!***<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Woof!  My name is Peter Maximus and I'm a 1 1/2 -year old Weimeraner.  I would like to bark high praises for my Alma Mater, K9 Companions, a loving environment for a puppy away from home.  (Okay, it's a tough-as-nails (Grrrr!) boot camp and I passed Basic Training with flying paws!)  But that was a year ago and now I'm back for the third time (see, I can even count now)!  My owners are off traveling again and are very happy each time they come home that I survived, learned a lot, and came away a better pooch for the experience.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Obedience training so I picked this place  I did my consultation everything was good I came back a week later to make my first payment $375 out of 750 they were nice enough to split the payments for me    My third visit which was my second payment of 375 which is finally a total of 750 I was able to start dog training B The first training was OK pretty basic light training didn't really  learn anything I didn't already know the dogs didn't learn anything they didn't already know the second dog training class was last Saturday they switch trainers for my male dog but not my female my female is the one that needs socialization skills Saturday night  Nola my female started coughing real bad turns out she has kennel cough  And I'm pretty sure she got it from their considering I've been to court five times because of her I don't take her out in public or anywhere the only place she goes is k9companions on Saturday.     I've done two of the six classes didn't learn anything new my dog got sick they won't give me my money back not even my money -2 unfilled lessons !

I think it's funny they took $375 before ever seen shot records

Neither one of my dogs have the shot that prevents kennel cough

The lady is able to tell that by looking at the shot records at the dog training class but didn't care enough to recommend me to get the dogs though shots but she cared enough to take my second payment and get started right away  The lady is able to tell that by looking at the shot records at the dog training class but didn't care enough to recommend me to get the dogs those shots but she cared enough to take my second payment and get started right away
Now don't you think if they were as compassionate about their animals as they say they were they probably would've at least recommended or preferred me to do that I mean you're the professional .

Don't you think it's kind of weird there doggy boot Camp is the only thing that requires the board at Tele or board at nova shot shot which is the medicine that prevents kennel cough  boot Camp is the only thing that requires the Tele or board nova shot shot which is the medicine that prevents kennel cough
Which they say is an airborne virus

Why only the dog staying overnight need the vaccination for an airborne virus if you train those dogs in the same exact place as you train my dogs using the same melon cutters unwashed that just sit there this is Stipid  i'm out $750 didn't get any training my female dog is sick and now I can't afford it

<Review>TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE place.  Do not send your pet there.  All these other recommendations are fake.  We sent our puppy there and after 18 days he ended up  sick and and neglected.  Our Vet said it was total neglegence and the owner of k9 companions didnt even admitt there was an issue, instead she blamed my husband and I of being overreactive, and treating our dog like a child.   Biggest scam Ive ever experienced.  We are filing a suit and reported them to animal control..  Be very careful.  I encourage anyone with a bad experience to speak out, because we based our decision on where to send Charlie on these reviews and that was a huge mistake...</Review>< pictures>

I've known Karen and George Duet professionally in the working dog community for over 10 years.

When I first became involved in French Ring sport is the first time I heard their names mentioned in the working dog circles and this was in the early 90s.  They even brought over a French decoy and trainer that really gave the sport a kick start in Southern California.

We then off and on through the years would see each other at dog seminars inwhich sometimes we both attended and other times one or the other were teaching.

They have an indept understanding of dog behavior and have trained all breeds of dogs.

Recently I had the opportunity to visit their facility (this month).  Very professional and beautiful facility with spacious clean kennels and beauitfully landscaped training field.  Beautiful setting to have your dog and yourself attend classes in Lake Matthews.

Duets have trained working dogs (police and detection) as well as advanced obedience and are very good with problem dogs.

Karen has also co-authored dog training book for Schutzhund.  I have learned a lot about the business side of dog training too from them.< /Text>

<text>We took our rescue dog Finn to K9 Companions in October 2015 for the 3 week boot camp.  We absolutely love our little Cairn Terrier mix that we rescued earlier on in the year, but he was showing signs of fear based aggression and some alpha traits that were not going down well in our home.  The last straw was when he tried to bite the roofers leg and we decided if he was going to be with us for the rest of his life (as we hoped) then something had to change. We returned to a new dog... one that sat, down and stayed for his commands.  One that listened, heeled and was generally a much better behaved member of the family.  His trainer (Karla) came to our house the same week we picked him up for a home session, and after he squealed and cried with joy to see her, she showed us some more fabulous commands to train him with.  I have just booked him back in for Board & Brush up which I know he will love (and I will be thrilled to know he is being taken care of and learning while I am gone!).
Thank you K9 Companions<//text>< username>

< Review>
Well you have to start off by realizing this is Ridgecrest! It's on us-395 somewhere between nowhere and somewhere. But it is a long way to any other dog parks so it is nice to have this break if you're heading up 395. The park is well fenced there are a lot of big shade trees the only real concern I would warn you about is that it doesn't appear in Ridgecrest that you were required to pick up your dog's poop if it's anywhere near a fence. So the perimeter of the park is lined with biological landmines. But it has grass, and it is in the middle of nowhere. So this part is definitely a 4 or a little above star<//Review>

<Review>Friendly people, so far.  Lots of space for the dogs to play. Small and large dog areas. There seems to be a place to put out water, but there are no fountains to fill a bowl. Plenty of potty bags...some folks don't know how to use them though, so watch out for random poop-piles.< /Review>< Pictures>

There is enough space for the dogs to run. There is a clique of older people who come everyday to the small side and a clique of big dog people. They are nice but take up their same spots everyday and will end up pushing you out of the table by exclusion. There are some owners who think their dogs bad behaviors are cute and a few reactive small dogs who also dominate others with humps frequently.
The large needed side of full of Huskies with dominance issues who don't listen to commands. You can constantly hear them getting loud and their owners yelling at them as if the dogs are caring.</Text>

<review>I was driving through town and stopped to let my little ones out. Ended up chatting with a few very welcoming locals and their well mannered pups.

There are poop bags and water for the doggies,  and ample seating for their people. Nice park.</review>< pics>

Great place to let your dogs run if you don't have a yard. Friendly fellow park users, great also for dog socialization.<//Text>

<Text>Well shaded with a water fountain for the dogs. Large area with plenty of room for running and playing. My only complaint is that the only trash receptacles are right by the gate so if your dog goes at the far end of the park you have to walk all the way across or hold on to your bag.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Response>None</Response><Text>I called at noon on a Wednesday to ask to see my Doctor who happened to be on the schedule that day. I was soon given a 5 pm appointment.
I was X-rayed on arrival and escorted to the dentist.
He broke his routine and examined me. It was not a tooth problem but a gum issue.
I was given a prescription and dismissed.
I’ve been a patient here for about 20 years and have always received courteous treatment from the staff and been very satisfied with all professional services. I’ve also recruited several friends to go there.<//Text><Name>Robert Damato< /Name>< pictures>

Normally I love this office.  At this time, I am upset because I have an implant and a crown which was placed 5 years ago in the Rancho Cucamonga office. The crown fell off 2 weeks ago possibly due to wear and tear, which I understand.  I saw the provider at their San Bernardino office and they said the existing crown needed a replacement because it was cracked. They used my old crown as a temporary, and it fell off the next morning. Today I had the new crown placed at the San Betnardino office,  and before I went to bed I brushed my teeth and the new crown came off. I have not chewed anything hard, nor had I yet worn my appliance. I don't understand how I had a crown that lasted 5 years, but a new one fell off the same day it was applied.  And of course the office is closed until Monday. Also I just read that a dental assistant is not allowed under the scope of practice to place a permanent crown, which is what was done today (my permanent crown was not placed by the doctor, she had the assistaand she never checjed the work before I leftt do it and was not present for</text>

<review>My DDS is so sweet and patient. Yesterday during my visit she examined both me and my husband, she was very attentive and addressed any concerns we have. Veronica, our RDH, was so gentle on the both of us. It was definitely the best cleaning we both have every gotten. Everyone was so kind and welcoming, especially Linda as she attended to both of us and did my husbands X-rays. Thank you all for your awesomeness!< /review>< pictures>

Made sure I was well numbed.  Did not feel a thing.  Very clean, with excellent procedures in place for COVID safety.  Friendly and welcoming staff.  They made sure I got in when I was in pain even though it was last minute.<//review>

<review>Great experience, it did take about 40 min
To be called back which was a bummer however the office is clean and everyone was very pleasant. Dr. Kate was AMAZING, so nice, direct, no shame, looked me right in my eyes and was very supportive, we came up with a plan and I felt at ease. Tara who is super knowledgeable on insurance and such was very nice as well, didn’t pressure me too hard to upgrade and was helpful and honest. I’m very happy and look forward to continuing my care with Hospitality Dental.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< date>

I received an excellent dental service from hospitality dental, San Bernadino, CA. Staff were extra-ordinarily willing to help through the process. Am happy with their procedures/service in such a timely manner. I highly recommend hospitality dental to any individual or family who might need dental care.<//review>

<review>Super happy with this place! I’ve been with Hospitality Dental in San Bernardino for over 25 years! I’ve had nothing but great experiences! Seriously ~ when you walk in to the lobby you're greeted by Michelle (muti-tasking professional and polite) asset to the dental office. Then you have Tina and Jackie really easy to talk to and reassure my procedures will go well. Rachel and Lisa are caring and professional with the dental instruments and super polite! Dr. Trammell is very professional and positive. Always has a good vacation recommendation to talk about while working. Brittney!!! Sweet Brittney thank you so much! Brittney accommodated me and rescheduled my appointment to help me last minute when I had a family issue to deal with. And then there is TARA!! TARA is the supervisor and manager of the office. She is super polite and goes out of her way to ensure everything is going well. Always professional and has a nice smile! Thank you all so much!< /review>< pictures>

<Review>We had hard time to find a good, dependable dental office when we moved to San Bernardino area. I found this Hospitality Dental & Orthodontics via Google search and it turned out to be such blessing as their patient recommended. These office staffs are polite, professional, and honest, and they took the time to explain and educate on their procedures.  In addition, they are very upfront with cost and willing to answer our questions. Last week my wife and I got excellent care during our first visit, we are so glad to choose this place, and we highly recommend this office.<//Review><Name>Donny Che< /Name><gmap_id>0x80dcac926ca37599:0x2eca588f1f32541f</gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>112734412248111639901</userid><time>1552803088667< /time><Rate>5</Rate>< response>

I loved it here! I was looking for a new dental office because the one I had been going to for a few years couldn’t fit me in for just my routine cleaning. I called in the day before and Hospitality Dental was able to fit me in as a new patient the very day I needed. I wasn’t able to get a cleaning that day on such small notice but for the very next morning which was perfect for me. The staff was friendly from the front end to Laura in finances. So happy I was able to come here. Def a returning patient!<//Text>

This office is just AMAZING! I definitely recommend coming to this office if anyone is looking for a great & stable Dentist. My dentist Dr. Perry took his time and explained everything to me and was making sure I understood everything he was saying! Usually im terrified of the dentist but not anymore!
The assistants Debra, Amy, & Rachel were so kind and great with me!  Also the checking in process and paperwork was super fast and easy the receptionist Shannon made sure that everything was ready for me when I got there and right away i was taken to the back. Then towards the end I also met Laura and Gisela, they made sure my appointment went great and asked if I had any concerns about anything and explained to me the breakdown of my insurance! Everyone made sure that I was well taken care of and couldn't have felt more of a warm welcoming coming into Hospitality dental!
Thank you!< /review>

<name>Brad Borrero</name><text>The team is absolutely fantastic! Dr. Trammell is a phenomenal dentist! He always knows how to make my teeth look and feel great. I get many compliments on my smile. Thanks Dr. Trammell.

And the support staff...they make you feel like a celebrity. Tina and Jackie are extremely friendly, professional, and treat you like family. Then there is Cecilia, what an amazing hygienist. Talk about attention to detail. I always look forward to my teeth cleaning and the sparkling job she does in keeping my teeth. Of course I can’t forget Shannon. She literally makes me feel like a superstar and always brings a smile to my face.  Machelle greets you at the front desk with a wonderful smile and a truly hearty welcoming!

If you haven’t been to Hospitality Dental, I highly recommend it. 5 stars and if I could give more I would! Thank you Hospitality Dental!< /text>< date>

I had a great experience at hospitality dental. I was helped by Machele, Tina, Lisa, And Jackie and they were great and made the office comfortable. Dr Kritzinger is a very good doctor and explain everything to me and veronica is one of the best hygienist. Linda was very kind and helpful with taking my X-rays. I highly recommend this office and hope to keep coming back with the rest of my family.< /Text>

I highly recommend this office. The place is clean, the wait is short, the staff is nice, and my dentist Dr. Lee was gentle and very friendly. He's the best dentist! I've been to several Dentists in San Bernardino and Riverside but to them I was just another patient but at Hospitality Dental, they make you feel like family. I plan on getting my braces done with them.</Text>

< Review>
Hospitality Ortho/Dental has been wonderful. A few years ago my husband and I were in search of a reputable fairly priced orthodontist for our son's braces. Everywhere I looked was either extremely expensive, seemed a bit unprofessional, rude, didn't return my calls, or couldn't get us in for months due to my husband and I working fulltime and my son being in school. Finally we came across Hospitality Orthodontics/Dental. Not only when I called were they extremely polite, they were willing to work with our schedules. They have dentists on staff until later in the evenings (later than most other dentist offices)
When we went in, they did an evaluation of my son's needs, gave us a price, and were very honest with everything. It has now been 2 years and the price they provided up front was almost spot on... Throughout each appointment, all staff has been extremely helpful at explaining everything when it comes to treatment and billing. I reccomend this office for anyone due to their accommodating office, schedule,  friendliness,  cleanliness, and transparency.< /Review>

I love this place, its clean, professional and I know I am in good hands with my dentist Dr. Pham and his dental assistant Debra they make it so much easier to come in even when I have a cavity. They just make me feel comfortable and I wouldnt go to any other dentist.< /Review>

To summarize my experience, I'd like to simply use one word "satisfaction" - Not the type that is tolerable but pure bliss (as if I were at a spa).

I have gone to six different dentist in me entire life and have NEVER been treated with such comfort, respect, acknowledgment and understanding (not to mention fast pace, yet not rushed service). First off I was late, and they understood (not that being late is ever acceptable unless you've communicated through the staff and confirmed you'll be seen).  I arrived to a clean environment and was introduce to Shannon; she had helped me through the process with such professionalism. I was immediately seen by Lynda who was a sweat heart! After that I was seen by Dr. Kritzinger who was so patient and kind with me; I'm not really an easy patient/client. No more than a few minutes later was I to be introduced to Adrienne who I was to meet with to discuss insurance coverage when they said they can do a cleaning on me by Veronica who assisted me right away and began to deep clean my teeth without being aggressive (which I hate to admit but most do) she also communicated with me through the process to make sure I was comfortable.  After that I was to be reunited with Adienne and she gave me all the information I needed to go furthter with any future procedures and my coverage, she showed me how to contact anyone in the event I needed to and escorted me out with patiance-- even though they had moments to close.

In no time did I ever feel discouraged, rushed, or disrespeted.

Thank you all that helped me directly,
I have no doubt that there are many  to assist with any services needed in such a comforting, professional and  inviting manner.< /text>

<Review>Park is very well kept up and friendly neighbors. However, the manager is indispicable and  has no forgiveness in her heart.   Do not get on her bad side cuz she will not back off.  Her co-worker is fantastic and very well liked!<//Review><gmapID>0x54d292ba7a1c0505:0xb96e42734aa895e1</gmapID><Rating>3</Rating>< resp>

Clubhouse could use some acoustic installation and when  warmer days are here, definitely need several large fans to accommodate large get togethers.😁</text>

Justin Scott, the manager at LES SCHWAB TIRE in Bakersfield, CA is a "super hero". Most places wouldn't take the time to repair a flat tire of a 3-wheel electric bike but he did. Repairing the tire was not a easy task, it required taking the bike apart and that took about 45 minutes and he did it with a smile. When completed, he said no charge and thank you for coming in! Amazing, I didn't tell him another Tire Company told me they couldn't help but Justin Scott did. Thanks, Justin and  LES SCHWAB TIRE.</text>

Ok they didn't just fix a hole in my tire, they also put my spare, jack, and tools back under the carpet in the place they belonged and checked the air in all my tires without me even asking. Everybody was very polite, and I was in and out in like 25 minutes.</text>

I spent 15+ years doing this for a manufacturer. I just asked for the service technician to look at a clunk noise in the front end as was rather specific in where the noise may be coming from. He proceeded to continually cut me off while I was speaking. EDIT*** What a way to make it up! By the time I left this establishment they completely changed my thought on the interaction.

My tire blew out last at night. Got towed to their location at night. Left a note for them and gave them a call later that morning. Their were friendly and professional they were able to get me a new tire and lug nuts. I live in Turlock so lots of driving so glad I found a good place with friendly staff like Dextor he was the Man today. Thank you for your services.

Came to get the tires checked and found out that the two front ones both had something in them  not only did they fix both of them they did it for free and we didnt even purchase the tires from them but best believe the next time we need tires this is where I'm going for now on.I also loved the fact that they didnt try telling us we needed all new tires like most companies try and do.< /review>

The guys always take care of me. A simple call to let them know im on my way, and when i pull up they will take care of me right away (unless theyre super busy)
My work also uses them for our entire fleet.<//Review>

Love dealing with Les Schwab. They make everything easy, they're super pleasant, and they stick behind their product. Just wish they did *everything* car related so I wouldn't have to go anywhere else!<//Text>

Picked up a nail on 99 while traveling from Fresno back to LA with the family. Stopped here and was wowed by the customer service. We have always enjoyed great customer service from Les Schwab, but Acacia at this location is a gem. She printed pages for the kids to color, popped fresh popcorn and made sure no new customers were left waiting at the counter. Thank you for the great service!!</Review>

I have been to many different Les Schwabs up and down the west coast. They all share the same commitment to good service. Plus free flat repair saved my bacon one time years ago. Free tire rotation on tires purchased there is a savings too.<//Review>< Resp>

<text>I've been there twice. The first time was good but, second time was horrible! I called on the phone to see if the were available and the guy tried to talk me out of going there and complained about the time and my vehicle but said if I was there by 5 they could do it. I got there 15 minutes before and was rudely greeted by another different employee at the counter. Was then harassed about not wanting to give out my email. Was then asked for a signature by the employee only saying "signature". No explanation of what for I'm signing for (I assume authorization) and when I didn't immediately sign he said "signature" again. No explanation or even prices. Then another customer came in for the exact same service and got their vehicle worked on  before mine. The guy that cashed me out on the other hand was nice and professional, but 2 out of 3 is horrible. The management there should really address their employees behavior or maybe even someone from corporate. It was a completely unprofessional experience and is not the way business should be handled.<//text>< Pics>

I went there because I was told that I needed all new tires. The guys at les Schwab were very nice. They looked at my tires and told me I have at least another good 6 months or more. I really appreciate their honesty. Because some other place would have just sold me tires that I don't need yet. I  will most definitely be bringing all of our vehicles her from now on.< /Text>

<user_name>Kerston Register</user_name><review>These guys are amazing. Justin and his team deserve a million stars. I had to bring them my truck at 6:15pm because the other shop it was suppose to get tires put on ordered the wrong size. I called Justin at 5:45 and asked if they could do a miracle because I was headed out of town tonight and needed new tires. Not only did they have the tires in stock but he said he would wait for me to get to the shop. I’m absolutely in love with this tire shop and team. I absolutely refuse to deal with any other shop.

These guys are some of the best humans I've ever met in my life!! They saved my Life my Sanity my Marriage AND my son's Dirt bike tires! Yes you read that correctly! They went out of there way to make my day better, way better on one of those days that you think nothingcan go right God reached down and gave me these guys. They were kind in a world where kindness is few and far between. And wile they were at it they were all smiles, laughs and great attitudes. If I wasn't already married I'd have my wedding in their building! In all honesty they switched some dirt bike tires but I had to run and get some tubes cause the one in it didn't fit and they didn't have it in stock but they not only didn't charge me for switching them the guy payed me back the money for the tube they didn't need! For real! And he had such a great attitude it lifted my spirits after a day of shopping for a camping trip at 3 different stores partly with a one year old... well lets just say it was one of thise days and they not only made it better but easier.. thanks guys your the best</text>

<review>This place is awesome! These guys have good customer service down to a science! So efficient and keep you fully aware of what is needed and how they can help, even if it is a service they personally do not offer, they offer suggestions to get the best service. So friendly and quick with a smile, also quick to get your work done and back to the road! Highly recommend this place, come see for yourself!</review>< Pictures>

I have been going to Les Schwab for 20 plus years. This is the slowest store I have ever been to. Definitely not living up to the quick service I have always experienced before. Seems like there are only 3 guys working. They definitely won't make a TV commercial from my story.</review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>I went into Les Schwab in Bakersfield on Buck Owens to get my tire repaired. I ended up leaving with 4 brand new tires for a price I couldn’t pass up. I was also having problems with my steering wheel as well but that man Justin there found the problem within minutes and fixed it free of charge. Saved me a lot of time and money. I’ll definitely be going back here for more work to be done on my car thanks to Justin. I’m just upset I didn’t come here earlier. 5 star customer service thank you again!!</review>< Response>

Once again, Les Schwab saves my day!!!  Fixed my spare for me last night, and today on my lunch hour, replaced the tire that matched my set!  This store has caring, friendly staff.  They really care about what they do and it shows!  You guys are AWESOME!!!!  Happy New Year too!

Dexter and his team totally helped us out as we were on our way to catch a flight out of LAX. We are from Fresno.  They greeted us at our car and didn't skip a beat getting the car up on the jacks and rebalanced the tires in no time! They put our minds at ease and we were quickly on our way.< /text>

Very friendly service. They tell you and show you if you have any problems with your vehicle. They actually work with you. You can't get that at any other tire shop around town. Plus the warranty's​ I get on everything I purchase here are always honored. I bought brand new rims and tires last summer in Bakersfield for my F-250 and the summer after cracked my passenger rear rim in Fallon,NV and took it to the Les Schwab there. They had the rim in stock and replaced it free of charge. Absolutely will not go to any other tire shop.<//review>

Straight up I was knocked down impressed with this place. I called the branch on Oswell & Arturo had created a quote for me then suggested I not drive my car to that location it was too far & I already had damage to one of my tires. He suggested I get my car to this shop. I called, Vic answered got me all set up I drove there (it was just around the corner) he had all 4 tires replaced before I could finish my coffee. Vic and the team there worked like a well oiled machine. I was very impressed with the Customer Service & the price. I highly recommend them...!</text>

<Review>Justin helped me. On the phone 10/10 service. And in store. I brought in my 04 Toyota corolla I recently got. And the rear brakes were squeaky. He cleaned them up for me and I didn't have to spend $$$ to replace them and I almost did a few times !. Great service. And when I do need a repair looks like I'm coming here!< /Review>< Pics>

Amazing customer service! They matched a price substantially lower than theirs and got us in and out in no time! Super clean store and friendly staff. They literally came running out of the store to greet us as we pulled in. Tbey definitely earned our business and we will reccomend them in the future!< /review>

Dexter, the manager, could use some customer service training. Wasted 2.5 hours of my time only to tell me they won’t fix a 1/4 nail hole near a sidewall. Just got it fixed at another corporate. Love les Schwab but this was not the great service I am used to.</review>

<Text>My Daughter and I were passing through to L.A. friday afternoon- 105 degrees on 99 and I blew a rear tire. Thought I was going to get killed trying to change that thing on the 99- pulled into Les schwab to make sure the rest of these tires where ok, I met Justin right away- he was already sweating a ton from working in the heat all day- But he smiled and asked what he could do to help- I explained I didn't want to replace all the tires but would if they needed it so we could make it safe and we were late.  He jumped in my truck, Pulled it in, Checked all the tires and recommended 2 tires to change only!!  he could of easily over sold me but he didn't and before I knew it we were on the road. I never had such great service!!!!!  My daughter actually looked up from her phone and said she thought we were not going to make it in Time.   Well We Did!!!   Thank you< /Text>< rate>

Nice tire shop. They were really fast. I have been a loyal customer to American Tires for many years but may have changed. They mostly sell Toyo tires that seem to be great quality. I always bought BFG tires previously. They seem to know what they are doing and have brand new fancy equipment to do the tire instal right. The employees are happy with their job which is nice. I believe they do a few other auto service besides tires but not for sure. I do recommend to others.

<time>1614719947293</time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I just want to say that your two employees that work there Morgan and Taylor are great employees . A few weeks ago I lost my credit card there on the floor and somebody turned it in and I was so happy when they informed me after I called there and I got my card back with no problems and that is a miracle in these days I also want to say that they do a great job of cleaning the restrooms and they’re kept very clean. Their attitude is always friendly and professional. My name is Mishelle Rohrich and  I am a bus driver for Omnitrans and every time I stop in there I have no problems with restroom or your employees.I just want to let you know and hopefully you recognize them for their hard work.👍🥰</Text>< pictures>

< review>
the air has been broken most of the time i put the 1.50 in and it just drains the air from my already low tire. please put out of order sign on it. i will go elsewhere for gas and everything due to this conscious corrupt practice.

i now see you have posted the out of order sign. great job. im impressed. hope you can fix it.<//review>

Good morning crew.  I frequent almost every morning. Went in last Saturday afternoon to  get a couple of things, and because the bank was closed, decided to pay for my order with a couple of winning scratchers and take the cash difference.
The clerk was insistent that because the prize was a free ticket, that I could only redeem for more tickets. I have never encountered that policy before. Nor will again.
Paid cash and walked out with now validated and useless tickets.
$20 lesson, will never shop there again.<//text>

<text>This is my usual destination when I go on walks. It gets me out of bed when I'm 100% depressed cause you can get like 44oz of coke for 95¢. Walk there with a dollar and come back with a nickel and maybe too much soda. 4 stars because I don't really like two out of the bunch of people that work there. The rest are p nice though.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Gas prices here are usually very competitive.  Drinks are currently $.89 for a large.  Good value for a cold drink.< /Review>

Also it is Circle K what else needs to be said? They have cheap fountain soda, all the snacks for everyone , a coffee station, and a great selection of beverages. The posted Gas prices always seem to be very competitive if not the cheapest in town.< /text><Rating>4< /Rating>< response>

<review>Who rates gas stations? As far as I know this is the first major fueling station on Hwy 38 when coming down the mountain from Big Bear. I'm nearly always in my Jeep (which gets terrible gas mileage) so this is a first stop before getting on the 10FWY for Los Angeles. I'd give 5 stars if they offered real half & half when I grab coffee.<//review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Because gas pomps are often ruined and there are only 4 and there are also some people who give pity more service when you speak to them in Spanish and they are Hispanic

(Original)

I have been searching for an amazing Church and a friend recommended Trinity.  I checked out sermons online and it is perfect for me...a Bible focused Church for sure and wonderful Church family...So many program and group opportunities for Christian's from all age groups...walks of life including those with any special needs. Have been there faithfully for 10 weeks and look forward to it each week. Check out the family and sermons online or better yet come on down on Sunday for one of the 3 convenient services.</Text>

<Text>This church is amazing. Pastor Todd is down to earth and delivers sermons that are relevant to life in the present day. There is something interesting going on every week besides the Sunday services and many opportunities for people to learn more about God as well as serve Him by becoming a volunteer. There are special classes for every age group and many exciting and fun events happening throughout the year. I never really thought of church as a fun place to be, but Trinity is just that.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80db560ccf766cf3:0x6f586a48804e5b7f</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Recent loss of my parents brought me to the GriefShare program hosted by Christina B. The program is 13 weeks long and accompanies you on your journey, on the loss of your love one. Thank you Trinity Church, Larry and Christina. God Bless you both.< /text>

Enjoyable Christmas Eve service. Very entertaining and not overly preachy, which was a pleasant surprise, considering that it's an evangelical church. Other than for my Dad's funeral service, that's the only other time I've been there.<//review>

<text>Excellent Church. We have a strong outreach to families dealing with disabilities. (King's Kids) We also have a  ministry for adults who are also living with disabilities. (Light & Power) We have a service for Spanish speaking worshippers. We also have ministries for everyone. Young to old, men, women and families, singles people living with divorce and their kids. We also have a program for people who are unable to get out of their homes. The teaching is excellent and spot on.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Wonderful service and lesson. Pastor Todd spoke about forgiveness and practiced what he preached when he told us that he had to ask his wife for forgiveness for something he said about her last week in the service. Great modeling! He admitted his faux pas and she forgave. 👩‍❤‍👩< /text>

We have attended this Church since we moved here almost 28 years ago.  People have come and gone but one thing remains the same.  Here you will find a group of good Christian people who are trying to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. Here we are taught to love God and love and serve our neighbors.  There is a spirit of love and friendship here and all are welcome to join us.</Text>

Our growing family LOVES this church!! It couldn't be more kid-friendly and more sensitive to the many struggles we all share as busy families. Jesus Christ is truly at the center.

We recently welcomed a new baby boy into our home and sure enough our church family showered us with love, phone calls, visits, gifts, and almost two weeks of consecutive dinners. There are so many opportunities to serve, worship, work, play and pray together. If you are looking for a church, look no further, come and join us!!!</text>

<Review>This is a wonderful church.  The people are kind and friendly.  They believe in Jesus Christ and try to follow his teachings to love others and lead good lives.  The youth stand out as happy and confident in keeping traditional standards of morality and having a great time together.

People of all ages, backgrounds, skin colors and walks of life are welcomed.  If you tell a church member you'd like to visit they'll be happy to help you, or you can just show up at Sunday meetings.<//Review>< user_name>

This is a wonderful building where I feel so much peace! Everyone is so welcoming and friendly, and it’s clear that absolutely anyone is welcome to come inside and partake of the sweet spirit here. My whole family, from small children to adults, loves coming to church here. It’s truly a church for everyone!< /review>

This church and group of people are wonderful examples of living the gospel of Jesus Christ.  We have lived here for nearly 20 years, raised our family here and have benefited greatly from the love and association with these great people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<//Text>

I have been to this building a few times for area conferences. It's a nice building on both the inside and outside. There is a large chapel and connecting gymnasium. The environment is clean and pleasant.</Review>

Great place to go to church! I love attending church here. The church teaches strong family values and principles founded in the teachings and doctrine of Jesus Christ. The people are kind, service oriented, and while no one is perfect, all strive to be better and help others be better each week. It is a great community to be a part of and a great way to grow your faith/spirituality individually and collectively as a group.< /text>

The world is full of negativity, doubt, hate, past experiences that get us to lose our belief in much of anything. The missionaries are out in the world taking the risk, the leap and the journey to do something that quite frankly most people would be to afraid to do. What is that risk?.. to stand for something good in this world. To focus and share to a lost world the peace that comes with the simple choice of believing in someone who can clear out pain, ease our doubts and strengthen us in our trials. That someone is Jesus Christ the creator and maker of this world. He was there at the beginning, he is there with us today and he will be there forever to give us hope and the ability to make it through even when there is no hope or light in our sight. To the missionaries that share that to a world that wants to stomp on good I say “THANK YOU” “GOD BLESS” and “GODSPEED”. The world needs you. I need you and the Lord thanks you. Keep it up!<//Review>

<review>The people here are super nice and form a welcoming, kind, tolerant and loving community for all people regardless of background, personal choice, etc. My wife, kids, extended family and I have been on the receiving end of great friendships and kindness for a long time. Again, do not take may word for it or any one else's for that matter. Come and see! Love what is taught here. Really has brought me peace and happiness as I have tried to live what I have learned.< /review>< Rate>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>AAgh, we have just watched Face 2 Face for Young Adults with Elder and Sister Soares and Christensen  for FHE tonight, and loved hearing about their experiences in the Church as members and to learn of their individual strength and commitment in their marriages.

I have loved hearing their Testimonies and have learnt how to become a more effective  Eternal companion and will strive to be happier in our home.

We love you and thank you for your beautiful examples.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80e83a07427cbe63:0xdd28dd04fbc6cc7a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Nick arrived promptly within the half-hour window we were given. He was wearing a covid mask and put little booties on to keep from tracking dust into the house. Nick was pleasant and professional throughout. He looked over the entire drain system, then cleared the clog promptly. The price was very competitive.

My house plumbing is overdue for a code upgrade, so Nick called his associate Sal who reviewed my piping with me. He provided me with 5 options for replacement and upgrades. Really, Rooter Hero has great employees providing solid work at great prices. I’d recommend them to anyone.<//text>< pics>

David called Juan the specialist who arrived almost immediately. Thorough, knowledgeable professionals and the friendliest service. I have been struggling to find a good company to just unclog my bathroom drain. The bathroom remodel guys had put all kinds of debris in the sewer pipe. Juan came in, removed the drain plate, ran the snake and got all the debris out. He knew his job and did it with a smile. They also cleaned out my other bathroom clog with a quick snake.
I could trust them and they took care of me! I’m a fan of Rooter Hero!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Jeremy showed up incredibly fast (at midnight), identified the problem and fixed it within 15 minutes.  He even went over how I could prevent and fix the issue myself in the future, and was super friendly throughout the whole process.  Highly recommended!  Ask for Jeremy, you won't regret it.</Review>

We are so happy with Rooter Hero Plumbing.  We had a  drain issue.
We called the Service Tech Omar and his partner arrived in less than an hours time.They were very professional, knowledgeable and very nice. We used Rooter Hero Plumbing a couple years ago for another issue and we were so pleased with their service that we wouldn't call anyone else because we want it done right the first time!<//review>

<review>Our repairman was John Lillie. This guy was top notch... knew exactly what he was doing and just did it, no up charging, realistic recommendations on repairing and long term maintenance. I don’t know it they’re all as good as John Lillie, but we are new homeowners and we will absolutely be using Rooter Hero again and asking for him by name.

THANK YOU JOHN LILLIE!<//review>< UserId.>

< Review>
These guys are like a bunch of used car salesmen. I had a water heater problem and when these guys showed up, they immediately pointed that need to replace a whole new water heater costing 4k, without even running any diagnostic testing on the water in bathrooms. Then when I refused to do it, the guy got all upset and just kept trying to sell me on all sorts of other stuff which doesn’t even fix the root cause of problem. Turns out I found another more honest plumber nearby who got the job done without having to replace new unit. Strongly don’t recommend this place.</Review>

<Review>Technician 8339 David Moreno was great. I was particularly impressed by his work ethics because his equipment was not working smoothly and he had to work twice as hard to get things done ... and he did.  Thank you.<//Review>< Pics>

Called Rooter Hero in the morning and was able to set up a 2 hour window time later in the afternoon that was convenient for me.
John Gonzales arrived on time. John was very professional, friendly and he unclogged are shower drain in approximately 20 minutes. He left our bathroom clean. Overall experience was excellent.
This is the second time I’ve used Rooter Hero and was taken care of swiftly, professionally and they are very reasonable when it comes time to pay the invoice. I highly recommend Rooter Hero!

Angel Vasquez of Rooter Hero switched out my pressure regulator.  He did a great job and was concerned for my satisfaction and peace of mind which I appreciated.  Cost was very reasonable. I would not hesitate to contact him for any future plumbing needs.  I will definitely refer him to friends and family.  He's friendly and efficient!</text>

I asked a lot of questions about the install and inquired of future projects as well and he was able to answer them all. This is my second time using Rooter Hero and I am happy to say we will only be using them going forward. Thank you Mario!<//Text>< username>

Humberto is very knowledgeable, and made the process very easy. I received regular updates from dispatch as to where we were on the schedule that day, and I received a follow-up call from the main office a few days later, just to make sure that we were satisfied with their work, and that our drains were working properly. Such a pleasant experience, and much better service than we’ve received from other companies that we’ve used in the past. I highly recommend Rooter Hero, and I will definitely use this company in the future. Keep up the great work, Humberto and Rooter Hero!< /text>< Pics>

<text>Discovered some really bad work from the previous owner of my house that needed attention. I was quotes all over the board for repairs but RotoHero came in at a competitive rate and was very professional. The job ended up taking a few days longer to complete but the team was professional, courteous, wore their masks and took pictures of the repairs for my records. Definitely would recommend.<//text><Date>1611610408967< /Date><Resp>{'time': 1617986687691, 'text': 'Thank you Travis for your honest review Glad that we able to provide you with good customer service looking forward to working with you in the future'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>The name of the technician not listed in your drop-down was Christian Vanegas. Very professional very nice person. I have to be honest Roto heroes wasn’t my first choice. My first choice LRS plumbing they were no call no show.  My dilemma started at 9 PM concerned that it was a safety issue they came out right away turn the unit off and said they would be out the following morning at 9o’clock and they were. I will use them again should I need them and I will recommend them several of my neighbors have already inquired.<//review><Name>Eddie Campbell</Name><Rating>5< /Rating>< GmapID>

<review>John Castaneda and his teammate did a great job of fixing a weak flush situation that had been plaguing my hallway bathroom intermittently for months. The service provided was timely, thorough, professional, and high quality. I really like how they spent time explaining the situation so that I was well-informed of what was going on, which is something not as common as you would think. An added bonus was that their thorough assessment of the situation led to the identification of other underlying issues on the property that will need to get addressed soon.

I don't look forward to the next time I will need Rooter Hero Plumbing's help, but I am happy to know that my household will be well taken care of when I do. I highly recommend Rooter Hero Plumbing to anyone with a plumbing need.</review>< Pics>

Great service provided by Luis who is A very experienced and courteous Technician. I had a kitchen sink drainage clogged issue. That was a very hard nut to crack. He spent a lot of times to figure out solutions for all the challenges that kept surfacing. Eventually he beat all the issues and emerged as a winner. Despite all the hard work, he still honored the preliminary estimate price. I was so impressed with his professionalism and workmanship. Thank you Luis!!

One of the drivers didn't stop at stop sign and almost hits me, then he wants to start a fight. If service is like that then better don't have one of these "plumbers"/fighters in the house.</Text>

Rooter hero responds promptly and I didn’t have to wait long until a technician was scheduled. On a Sunday! The service is performed at a good quality and the technician was very friendly.
The service could be even better if every technician put on shoe covers, for hygiene reasons.
Overall good service, rooter hero is a good business</Text>

Experienced a water softener bypass failure that flooded the garage at 5 am. Called the business around 6 am and had the problem fixed by 11am. Very satisfied with the response time, professionalism and quality of the work.

John suggested a couple of options to resolve the problem and was courteous and prompt in completing the work.< /Review>

He was extremely patient with the fact that it took awhile to get the three sinks we have to unclog. He also was very communicative regarding what he was going to do before doing it and worked with us with costs. I've had many people over to work on different issues with my home this year and I would have to say Jonathan was the most patient, understanding and respectful person we've had. He also always wore his mask, gloves and shoe covers while talking to me & in my home which was much appreciated especially during this time.<//review><user_id>111881350514265117589</user_id><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

I've used there service before and had a good experience. However this time it has been a bit painful. Called around 12 on Sat. Was told between 4-6pm and they were not here until 830pm. Our bypass for water softener was shot as a temporary fix solder a new point so we have water to the house. He cut the pipping however he wasn't able to solder a new point. Before we had at least the front yard hose. Now we have to shut the main line because of the pip is left open. He was a nice guy but I have no water. Waiting for someone to come in today, Sunday between 9-11. It's 1052.... No one showed up. The technician was nice to follow up to see if anyone showed up. Very disappointed but the experience but the technician was professional and nice but aside from that I probably won't be calling this company again.</review>

Professional, courteous, clean, excellent communications and service. Their zero interest financing for 18 months was a godsend for this single mom widow and owner of home built in 1959.

<text>Rooter hero arrived at my rental property to fix a simple plug at our washing machine drain.  It should have been a quick $77 rooter yet - rooter hero decided to try and take advantage of a property owner that was out of town (Me)  The manager explained that my pipes were old and there was a plug that was rock solid - snaking would not work /  he offered a several thousand dollar pipe replacement which I declined - he followed up with a $700 power flush that he explained was the only way to clear the hard plug.  The manager explained that the plug would not clear without a $700 power flush.  They scheduled the $700 power flush on Monday afternoon.  I flew into town on Monday morning before rooter hero arrived - I simply placed our garden hose in the washing machine drain and started running water - I quickly reached full hose flow with NO BACKUP AND NO BLOCKAGE.   The $77 rooter service had worked fine . I crawled under my rental property and discovered that all of my pipes were updated abs and were in excellent shape ( rooterhero told me my pipes were old and needed replacement.)I called rooterhero and informed them that my pipes were working perfectly after the $77 snake service and wanted to know why they had demanded a $700 flushing service later that day.  The manager seemed surprised that I was in town and that I knew my pipes were all updated .  He quickly apologized and claimed it was all a big mistake .  He instantly zeroed out my bill- no charge for snake or power flush - my entire service was free.  They were worried I would report them for fraudulent activity.   Long story short - rooter hero attempted to rip me off for several thousands of unneeded repair they reduced it to $700 of unneeded flushing.  They ended up crediting me for all of their snaking services .  Rooter hero should be shut down for fraud and misrepresentation.  They prey on desperate consumers at their time of need - these guys are scum bags - don’t believe anything they say or recommend .  I have documentation to prove all of my claims and welcome any challenge from this awful company</text><Gmap_id>0x808fa33b072bace5:0xd3341eec80d40259<//Gmap_id>< Time>

Just worked with Adam and Will from Hero Plumbing. Excellent service !   We received great communication from the company when we scheduled and then today to confirm their arrival time. Both employees followed COVID procedures, wearing masks ,sanitizing - They even took our temperatures when they arrived!  Both were polite and professional and Adam is a skilled plumber. They took care of a terrible clog and Adam inspected our line, alerting us to some potential problems with our 70 year old system. Everything was thoroughly cleaned before they left. I highly recommend this company. Thank you !<//text>

Excellent response. Technician, Carlos, arrived within an hour of my call and handled unplugging our sewer line efficiently and without issue. Very friendly and polite and skilled.< /Review>

We had a great experience with these guys they were able to come out the same day we called. They worked hard on the first day to try and resolve our issue but when the couldn’t they were back promptly the next morning. When they told us we needed a new clean out at the front of our house they said we’d have to lose a mature Camilla bush near the steps to our front door. When I objected and asked if we couldn’t just cut it way back, they were willing to try and worked around it. Nothing but great things to say about Marco and the crew.<//review>

< Review>
I would give 0 star if I can. Terrible company from technicians to the supervisor.
The customer service would set up the same day appointment with you but the technician will never show up. Do not believe technician will show up late evening and weekend.
My first appointment was May 13 6-8 pm and the technician show on May 14 noon. This is my investment and tenants has a clogged toilet. Technician called me and said it would cost me $329 to fix. I told him I have other plumber came before charged me $150. He immediate matched the price for $179 and said my pipes have problem if I want to pay extra to use camera. I said no camera but I did not tell the technician I did it with other plumber and nothing wrong with the pipes. After the technician finished he told me there is 3 months warranty. On Aug. 1, my tenant called me he has same problem. The second technician showed up on Aug 3 to fix the clog. Less than 2 weeks, Aug. 15, my tenant called me again and said same problem came back.This time I requested to talk to the supervisor because I was dissatisfied with the service. The supervisor called me back, OMG this is the worst person I ever talked. He kept saying my pipes have a problem when the technician told me to repair. I asked him your technician never checked my pipes how do you know my pipes have a problem. Then he said your warranty is over you need to pay to do the service again. I can not believe this is license plumbers and their job just lasts 3 months. I am out of my warranty for 1 day.<//Review>

The most recent work was done by Jason who was professional, on time and responsive. He came out to tweak some work done a couple of years ago. I had issues in the past with timeliness with RooterHero but Jason was perfect. If I have work done again with this company I would request Jason. I believe he is honest and does good work, above and beyond.  He doesn’t just make it work but does what he needs to, to make it a good job. “The right way”
Can’t say enough about Jason, he is also a pleasant guy.<//text>

<Review>Jose was prompt and very courteous. He quickly found the problem and explained the root cause. He kept the area tidy and we all wore masks in our interactions. Within 2.5 hours, our kitchen faucet was fixed and problem solved. If we encountered the same problem again, Jose said that he would come back to take a look. I recommended the business to a colleague after this great experience.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Name>Christina Sheridan< /Name>< Gmap_id>

I don't know what to say when he broke the cleanout pipe.  He said that it was rust.  I mentioned to go thru the kitchen pipe.  Somehow he
put it back but I'm not sure it wouldn't leak.  I will inspect to see for what sort of course I need to take.  I'm updating my comment when Ron from ROOTER HERO called this morning about my concern and told me to send out an inspector for my concern.  Danny and Jason came by, inspected, and repaired the pipe to my full satisfaction.  What a professional service!  Yes, they gave me a confident and reliable service that I will call them again for my future plumbing needs.<//review>

<Name>Teri Brown< /Name><Text>Eric and Gabriel came to fix my sink and pipes under the house. They arrived on time and were absolutely professional and as polite as can be. These guy's worked non stop and did not quit till everything was perfect. They left no mess at all. It was spotless when they left.  If the need arises to call a plumbing company, stop wasting your time talking with other plumbing outfits, searching the internet etc. This company is the one to choose. No matter what day or night of the week, they are there 24/7 and will be at your house quickly, very quickly.
Rooter Hero is the one! Thank you for an outstanding job. Thank you Eric and Gabriel, you are the plumbing heroes!!!!!

Omar and Adrian were amazing. They came in and analyzed the problem and provided me with multiple solutions in the upmost professional way. They definitely care about their customers and it shows that the company Rooter Hero, supports the people over profits mentality so with that being said I highly recommend Omar and Adrian for any of your plumping needs.</review>

After being cancelled on my initial scheduled appointment, I was very hesitant to expect someone to show up the next day. But fortunately, right at the expected time, Alex showed up! He was very professional and courteous! In less than 15 minutes, the drain was unclogged. He also explained the reasons these types of things happen! 5 stars!< /review>

Calling them for checking my leaking water heater and being told that the inspection is free. However, after inspection the technition asked for $77 for the inspection. I pay the fee out of coutersy, not an obligation.< /text>

I called Rooter Hero due to an embarrassing operator (me) error ... Victor showed up and showed me everything was working, cleaned up around the drain, helped to put a mushroom hair stopper in, and refused any token of appreciation.   He’s professional, neat, and considerate, I will certainly use Rooter Hero again.<//text>

Very experienced and professional.  The flat rate price far exceeds an hourly rate.  Besides the repair once they found the root of the problem, they were able to quote options for preventative maintenance.<//text>

Julio was great! Had me up and running in 24 hrs. on a broken sewer pipe. Other plumbers scheduled me a week out. Answered all my questions and made sure I was taken care off. Price was better than others and places too.</Review>

<review>David Sanchez came to my mother's home to clear the lines.  He explained everything he was going to do and then walked us through it.  Gave good explanation of the costs, etc.  Very knowledgeable, friendly and patient.  Used the camera to let us see what was happening.  Suggested the smaller camera which we will utilize next time.  Will definitely use again.</review><UserId.>101665573686515835401< /UserId.><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

Ask for Johnny! He’s the best. He came out here to San Mateo on the same day I called. He was punctual and professional, and he solved our problem in minutes. He also taught us a few tricks we didn’t know about our drains. We have found our go-to plumber! The pricing was very reasonable and we are fully satisfied with the services we received!

Gave me suggestions on preventative maintenance.  I would highly recommend Rooter Hero & ask for David!!  Hopefully, I won't need them anytime soon, but if I do I know who to call!< /Text>

Called rooter hero to take advantage of their $77. special to clear slow line.  Appointment was easy to make with much availability for my convenience, confirmed day of and again within hour of service. Freddy arrived promptly and was very thorough.  Got the job done in an hour.  Service recommend.< /review>

Technician David Sanchez and his associate Michael were absolute professionals! They arrived promptly, worked quick and clean and clearly described the problem. David went out of his way to fix the problem in the most cost effective way for me and also fixed my leaky sink in addition for only the cost of the simple part needed. Highly recommend these guys!<//Text>

< Review>
I saw multiple tv ads for Rooter Hero's $77 drain service that I decided to test them on 4" mainline clean out.  I was changing my toilets and wanted to make sure my line was clear to the street. Called 800 number to get receptionist who took my info, sent info to scheduler, who called me to give me 2 hour service window. Later he called back & confirmed early time if okay with me. Two polite & respectful uniformed employees Jose R and Juan R showed up with 100' power snake that cleaned any debris in line! I paid using CC and they were done less than 30 minutes! They both refused tip$ and didn't try to upcharge me for additional services! I was impressed & will use then again!
I have used this company 3 more times to snake main lines to street. This time David gave me good advice to make few repairs before call them back.< /Review>

< review>
I really enjoyed the professionalism and knowledge that JohnAlex and his team have. My grandparents had a major back up in their home. They called Rooter Hero and Within 30mins JohnAlex came by and helped solve their issue. I ended up stopping by to help my grandparents. We ended up having their specialist Sal come and camera the sewer line and the scene was not pleasant. They gave us multiple options to fix the issue for band aid fix to permanent. We choose the middle option they offered. The price was definitely a little higher then others but What stood out more was each person was friendly and kept their promises, Also they made sure the work area was cleaned and even power washed the stuck on dirt and mud. JohnAlex even brought some coffee for them. Thank you Rooter Hero! Definitely will recommend you guys.< /review>

Hero Rooter employee  Mario Canas did an exemplary job. Methodical and consistent to details. He’s not one of the best but “the best” of the repair crew.
I strongly recommend Hero Rooter.< /review>

The technician arrived well within the specified time, was knowledgeable, courteous and quick to solve my problem. He also provided me with recommendations of preventative measures that should be taken without being pushy or trying to get me to agree to anything I wasn't prepared to have done then and there. Overall, considering the circumstances,  it was a very satisfying experience.< /Review>

The rooter hero plumbing has not done a right job. Their AD says beautiful and their never follow the word of the AD and never answer you if they did not correct job. They did some work on my friend property, the work was wrong completely and my friend family called and emailed them and never got answers from rooter hero pluming San Jose which did not care what the AD says and 10 years warrant for their jobs. They only want to get money with those words. Keeping carefully with the AD and 10 years Warrant or Guarantee of Rooter Hero. They only want money with bad work.</Review>

Tech came on time and had a great attitude.
He did good work and didn’t rush anything.
He did the job he was supposed to and even more.
He actually refused to take a tip for his good work.
What a novel idea.....
Good service, good price, and timely.
We need more companies like this.
Thank you rooter Hero.<//Review>

<Text>The team is really courteous, but I’m not sure if all of the work they performed was absolutely necessary and I’m 100% positive I payed 30% more than I would have with an independent plumber (because I was given an estimate by another plumber). Their technology was helpful but make sure to get a 2nd opinion and a counter estimate on any work over a few thousand dollars.</Text><user>115627439784705351258</user><Rating>3<//Rating><resp>None< /resp><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Josh was very professional and we were impressed that he put all things back to its correct place in the back yard once work was done. Josh was on time yesterday and did come early today with Chris to complete pending work; appreciate that.< /text>

<text>The team is really courteous, but I’m not sure if all of the work they performed was absolutely necessary and I’m 100% positive I payed 30% more than I would have with an independent plumber (because I was given an estimate by another plumber). Their technology was helpful but make sure to get a 2nd opinion and a counter estimate on any work over a few thousand dollars.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fa33b072bace5:0xd3341eec80d40259< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<user_id>112514970897300427020<//user_id><Review>Foolishly attempted to replace a faucet on my own, on a Sunday, and got stuck halfway. John ‘Alex’ Gonzalez from Rooter Hero came to the rescue. It only took about 45 min from the time I called dispatch for someone to get to our house, which is seriously great considering it was Sunday. The old faucet nut was stuck on in a such a way that Alex had to try 10 different ways to remove it. He had the patience of a saint. I couldn’t be happier with the high quality level of service, not to mention speediness. They don’t call them “Hero” for nothing! Saved their info to my permanent contacts for future rescues.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Name>beth wells< /Name><time>1580871016253</time>< gmapID>

< Review>
Skip the rest and try the best! What started to be a stressful situation turned out to be the best phone call I made it ever. Marco showed up and save the day. He entered my place with boot coverings to keep my place clean. I had no idea the expertise it would take to correct the situation. He was courteous, persistent and solved a plumbing problem. He was prepared having all the tools and equipment it takes. My home was left clean. In my book that is what it takes to get you through an emergency. I would strongly urge you to use ROOTER HERO PLUMBING for all your plumbing needs and you won't be sorry. You will be saved too!  Thank you Marco!</Review>

We are generally well pleased with the overall project though it's not completed yet.  After the inspection is made we'll know that the work was  done properly.
I must say that the personnel were helpful, accommodating and experts at their individual responsibilities.  I'd rank them with all five stars if it wasn't for a scheduling glitch that extended the job by  a couple of days<//text>

Our kitchen sink got clogged in the night and I called the 24x7 help line for an appointment. They gave me 9 to 11 window, but I requested an appointment as soon as possible. Then the tech called me in the morning at 6:30 and had someone come over a little after 8.

Jose arrived on time and fixed the problem pretty quickly. He fixed the issue and also walked us through the problem and told us how we can check and a few things the next time we experience the same issue.

< Review>
Before Rotor Hero could finish the job on my rental property, sent a guy ( could be independent contractor) named Jeff . He asked for more than $400 even without looking for my problem. I sent him back from home without letting him start the job. Called toll free number spoke to Lilly explained situation, suggested her  to send the same guy who had serviced us before. She looked in my history and sent Jose within minutes.very cool and knowledgeable guy took only 15 minutes to fix the problem. He was on the way to next job after charging us bare minimum $77. He did even refuse to accept  tips saying that that is against policy. Thank you Jose and his bro for timely and to the point help. Next time if I ever call I will ask for him only. Thank you Lilly for being helpful at the same time I am afraid how many households fall in pray for unnecessary  work and expense from guy like Jeff?

<Text>Before Rotor Hero could finish the job on my rental property, sent a guy ( could be independent contractor) named Jeff . He asked for more than $400 even without looking for my problem. I sent him back from home without letting him start the job. Called toll free number spoke to Lilly explained situation, suggested her  to send the same guy who had serviced us before. She looked in my history and sent Jose within minutes.very cool and knowledgeable guy took only 15 minutes to fix the problem. He was on the way to next job after charging us bare minimum $77. He did even refuse to accept  tips saying that that is against policy. Thank you Jose and his bro for timely and to the point help. Next time if I ever call I will ask for him only. Thank you Lilly for being helpful at the same time I am afraid how many households fall in pray for unnecessary  work and expense from guy like Jeff?
He deserves some ethical and professional training besides disciplining.<//Text>< username>

Fast, friendly, efficient, and good prices!  We price checked with three different companies when we had a serious plumbing crisis (tiolets weren’t working and sewage was filling up both showers). They guarantee their work for 3 months, and they wouldn’t even accept a tip from us!  We’ve found our “go-to” plumbers. They are definitely our heroes!<//Review>

<Name>R. A.< /Name><Response>None< /Response><text>Rootor Hero came out to rescue my house on a Sunday I might add. Marco came out and looked over his options. I had two toilets that backed up, one in a bath tub the other one in a shower. They were on the same side of the house. There was no trap to use for these to snake out the blockage. He decided to take off the toilet in the rear of the house to snake the sewer line. It took some time and patients to complete the job, but he stayed with it and succeeded in removing the blockage. Marco then re-installed the toilet and cleaned up everything. A job well done!! I would rate his job 5 Stars.
Also I did call a few other plumbers and they all stated they could not make an appointment until a few days out. Rooter Hero listened to my problem and made an appointment for Sunday the next day at 9:00 am. They were on time and did a great job. I would highly recommend them to anyone who is in need of service.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Mario the service technician was absolutely awesome! I’m in the trades and Mario was patient with me and explain to me in detail where my issues were. He showed up with a handshake and a smile which is hard to come by nowadays. I really appreciate the work that was done I can rest of ease!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Rooter Hero Ads clearly state "Free Camera Inspection" with any drain cleaning. Yet the gentleman who came to clean the drain refused to do so. He stated that it is unnecessary. He simply used an Auger (not a snake) to "clean" a small portion of the toilet drain and then claimed that the problem is with the toilet flush and not the drain.<//text><name>Obi110 For1200< /name>< Response>

<review>Despite the length of time (see note below) it took to complete the project, I am leaving a 5 rating due to the service we received.  I want to give a big thanks to Juhuru who followed up on all issues as well as Sal who explained everything that needed to be done to us in layman's terms and in detail.

What started out as what we thought was a simple sewer back up turned out to be a major problem.  We had much needed clean out valves installed on this 50+ year old home.
If the clean out valves had been installed the original problem would have be a simple fix.

The length of time was not entirely Rooter Heroes fault as once the clean out valves were installed the City took a long time to do the inspections.

Thanks again to Juhuru, Sal and all the others who worked to get our plumbing projects corrected<//review>< response>

<review>A little late on the review. But I would like to thank Antonio M he was really great and professional
I had a problem with the bathroom toilet a few months back. I called a few companies they did not fit my schedule. Than I called Rooeter hero, about an hour later Antonio showed up at my door step he was very patient with all my questions he gave me a price that was more than what I thought it would be but after watching the way he performed I knew it would be all worth the spending.

Than you rooter hero I will definitely be calling you out with any further plumbing issues.<//review><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808fa33b072bace5:0xd3341eec80d40259</gmap_id><Date>1553103618228< /Date>< UserId.>

He was extremely professional, patient with my questions, polite and friendly, and cleaned up after himself.  He made sure every issue was dealt with and everything operating smoothly before leaving.  He went the extra mile in every possible way.  I'll definitely be calling Rooter Hero again.

Mario was polite. But he was unable to do the job. He needed a ridiculous $300+ camera charge to see where the clog was. I took a hard pass on that. Thanks for trying tho. I’ll have to go with a more reasonable approach professional.< /review>

< Review>
Matthew Sanchez, Field Supervisor, and David Herb, Technician, of Rooter Hero Plumbing of San Jose, successfully cleared a very difficult blockage of our toilet plumbing. They worked all Saturday afternoon and late into the evening to push their snake from an upstairs toilet through horizontal pipes and down along a wall into the sewer inlet. The blockage did not clear despite their success in reaching the sewer. Not to be deterred they returned on a subsequent day, repeated the procedure for no extra charge, and cleared the blockage. They were extremely neat and careful of our home, always taking care to use booties and to keep the bathroom clean and dry. We recommend them highly.< /Review>

This was a horrible experience. We have used this company before and gave them 5 stars but will be changing that review on yelp shortly as we feel they probably ripped us off BIG time (shame on us).

We called them out for a noise we were hearing.  They said there was air in the pipes calling it water hammer and suggested we put in new valves behind the washer.  To do this they had to make holes in the wall.  They said it would be $3000. Foolishly we agreed.  The guy worked on it all day and when he went to turn the water back on he forgot to turn off the valves in the laundry room and water shot out into the laundry and kitchen onto the hard wood floors.  We spent the next 2 weeks with blowers in our kitchen and laundry room 24 hours a day to try and dry the floors. Talk about an inconvenience !!

But  wait...it gets better.  After all this the noise was still there!!!  They then wanted to put in a pressure valve for another $1000.  At this point we decided to get a second opinion.  We had another plumber come and within an hour he had gone under the house, found and fixed the problem and only charged us $140.00.  We have had no problem since.

We feel this company rips you off and charges way too much and their technicians are not well trained.
Run as fast as you can.</Text>

< Review>
I came home from work on 5/30/19 to a kitchen sink with waste water backing up into it. I called 2 others before Rooter Hero. They had no one available that night. Turns out that was lucky for me.  Jason was great.  Confident and competent. He showed up in what looked like a freshly pressed shirt, clean hands, looking very professional. I live in a  highrise building, so to access my kitchen sink's drain pipe, he had to work under the sink. It took 3 tries to finally clear the blockage. 3+ hours later, 1030 PM, black gunk up to his elbows, smudges on his face and head, sweaty, tired, Jason cleaned the kitchen area even better than it was before.  I have had this problem 3 times in the past 4 years.  I will be calling Rooter Hero from now on for all my plumbing issues and will hope I get Jason.< /Review>

< review>
This company has 6 complaints with the contractor state licensing board. The complaints are for violations of the business and professions code, failure to obtain permits, misrepresentation to obtain contract. They have been referred to legal action on two of the cases. Please research all contractors before hiring anyone. Here is how their scam works. You have a sewer back up at an inconvenient time. Rooter hero comes out to snake the drain the service is only $89.00. They put a snake down the drain partially and make a horrific amount of noise it takes a good 20 minutes of the noise. Then the rep will tell you he also put a camera down the pipe and you have a seperated pipe and he cannot clear the drain. You will need a re-pipe and it will cost between $3500 and up to $12,000 depending on if you are a woman, elderly, or disabled.  If you tell them to get off your property they will try to charge and additional 200 to 300 for the "camera" of which you will not see any equipment nor can they produce pictures. And if you call another company to come out for under $150.00 in 10 minutes your pipe will be cleared.

<Review>Freddy was on time for the window we were given. He took care of the problem very fast and showed us what caused the problem. No tools were neccessary. Since he was here he taught us about the type of toilet insides we have. I was really worry because we have 2 of our granddaughters visiting and I'm out numbered for the use of the bathrooms. 😂

Shortly after the call had a text and a call from their dispatch our appointment time was 10:30-12:30. David was on time and very knowledgeable as he quickly assessed the issue which is not an easy task on our 65 year old house. He took his time and the cost was nearly half of Roto-Rooter the last time we called them. No fees to show up, no upsell, honored coupon, and most importantly fixed our problem.

I had a problem with our kitchen drain over the weekend not draining.  I had this same problem last year but was able to clear it up by checking the garbage disposal, the p-trap, and running a drain pipe auger through the pipe line.  This time I encountered a blockage in the pipe line as I ran the auger.  I called Rooter Hero this morning and the customer service person confirmed my appointment for today and within an hour from when the servicemen contacted me he was here ready to clear up the problem.  Eddie was very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable.  He answered all my questions as he tended to his business of clearing the pipe line.  The water from the kitchen sink is now running through!  Thanks Eddie and Rooter Hero, you made my day!!</Text>

Our problem (Pipe leaking) was solved very quickly and their response was very quick and organized.  However, the other man came while the guy was repairing our pipes and he found another problem. I agreed to fix that one and he said it took 4-5 hours to repair them.   However it took 9 HOURS to fix them. They shut down our water so we couldn’t use water for 9 hours. The guy who found that problem gone leaving the workers and no followed up or supervised anything until I texted him that the workers were still working at 9pm. They finished that at midnight!!!  They should have explained to us what was going on after  they were still working past 7 or 8 o’clock.<//review>

I believe we were over charged. This company had to replace all sewage pipes and one day and 15,000 seem like way to much but my parents are elderly and we could spend the time searching and getting appraisal with others. Once done with plumbing our toilets don’t flush right. Called them out and they said there was something plugging one toilet and now it’s fixed. Still not flushing correctly and plugs up.
When the entire job was complete plumber told us job needs to be inspected by San Jose City for approval.  They gave us a date and never showed up. I continued to call throughout the day and never got a return call.
I would not recommend this plumbing service not even for a leak!< /Review>

< Review>
Rooter Hero Plumbing are one of the most professional that I have come across in quite a while.  I am in Real Estate and really look for the best for my clients. Mario, one of their technicians, returned to repair a leak in the garage sink. His professionalism and courteousness to my client was second to none. The client is a senior lady in her 80's without a lot of patience, and Mario impressed even her.  The main job was large, replacing sewage line to the center of the street in Saratoga, great work, great price. I highly recommend this company. Answering calls...immediate response!!</Review>

Called them for a broken pipe at 10 pm. They showed up just to tell me they didn’t have the parts and they will have to come back in the morning with a specialist. In the morning they showed up and quoted me $1,400.00 to repair a broken pipe that I had already found the leak and had dug up. After getting their price I went to several stores and found the parts. Once I had the parts it took me one hour to repair it myself and I’m not a plumber. Parts cost was $45.00 including the sledgehammer I purchased to brake the concrete. And they still charged me $100.00 because they came by the night before. Ripoff is an understatement. I can provide the before and after pictures.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><review>Called them to fix drainage issue in bathtub, it wasn’t draining the water.
They came to check if they can fix the issue and estimated the price of $224. It was little higher than others but I heard its big company so I decided to go with them.
However, after like 20 mins they came in saying that they couldn’t fix the issue and telling me that I’ll still have to pay. I told them you guys told me that you could fix and that’s why you inspected in first place and now you’re asking me to pay without resolving the issue.
J didn’t want to argue much so they ended up ripping me off!!!

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I woke up one morning to find one of the ribbed copper pipes leaking; the floor was covered in water.  The owner of the company came out with one of his employees to assess the problem.   The rubber pipe was welded to the copper pipe on one side with a fitting on the other.  The job was extremely pricey.

The real problem arose when we needed to relight the pilot light.  Initially they said to let it dry out.  So, we did so for a couple of days, but the pilot light would still not light.  Our water heater is 9 years old, so when I asked if they could relight it because the igniter didn't seem to work, he replied that because it is 9 years old they do not do that and said that we would need to spend $3000.00+ on a new hot water heater.

I called another company and they came out to look at it and said that the only thing wrong with the water heater was that the igniter switch is faulty.  In the meantime, they took a lighter to light the pilot light so we could have hot water till they could locate the part.

As far as responsiveness, this company is great.  Where another company required a day appointment window to fit me in, this company came out within 45 minutes.  However, everything else about this company is sorely lacking.  They don't complete a job and are looking for the big bucks.  Their customer service, which includes what the customer needs in order to resume life with the impact to their daily routine is non-existent.

This other company got us going with just a quick consultation, and we'll likely give the guy that came out a few hundred dollars for his hospitality.  I would give Rooter one more penny from this point forward.  I advise everyone to stay far away from them.< /text><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808fa33b072bace5:0xd3341eec80d40259< /Gmap_id>< pics>

< review>
I had a clog to my laundry sink. I called Roto hero because I got their coupon saying $77 to unclog any drain. A plumber came to my place,  he didn’t honor the coupon and said because he needed to open the pipe to get the snake in, he would need $175. I agreed that price. He tried to snake the pipe but couldn’t go through. He said he would need to go to the crawl space to see what is wrong and will need $390 to just check (not including fixing the problem). How can you see the problem in crawl space if you can’t snake through a pipe! I told him I didn’t need him to look, he was willing to take $77 and leave. He didn’t fix anything. I paid him $77 and called Marti plumbing. Plumber from marti plumbing unclog the pipe in 15 minutes. I called rooyet and asked for a refund. They said a supervisor will call me back. It has been 6 hours, I haven’t got any callback yet.<//review>

Technician was never able to unclog my sewer and wanted $6000 to dig up my yard to find the problem. Pricing was way out of line. Yelp reviews confirm the unethical nature of this company. I am still waiting for the return of my deposit after 2 weeks.</text>

This is a shady operation and a scam at best.  First you call a call center somewhere else in the state.  Then they promised me a time between 11:00 and 1:00 the next day.  I get a call a 1/2 hour before they are supposed to show up saying they want to reschedule for later in the day.  I ask if they are really going to show up or if they are just buying time,  she put me on hold and "confirmed" it would be no later than 1:30.  They never showed up so I called them again.  They said they had no technicians available but I was "next on the list".  I asked what that meant and she said, she couldn't tell me. All she could say was that no techs were available and I was next.  I pressed her on the issue and she said maybe between 4:00 and 5:00 but she couldn't guarantee anything.  I told her this was a scam, completely unprofessional and if their scheduling was anything like their work, they shouldn't be in business.  DONT USE THIS COMPANY!  Outfits like this don't deserve to be in business and are representative of an old and outdated way of doing business.  What if I gave them a check and said it might be good in a few days but I couldn't guarantee it.  Find a reputable company instead.< /text>

These people came out yesterday and said it would cost $2000 to fix a tiny leak by my meter. They even made the leak worse! I just got the leak fixed by another company for $300 and it only took 15 minutes. These people either didnt know what they were doing or were trying to scam me. Dont call these plumbers, you will get ripped off.<//Text>

<text>Mr. Edgardo Matas-Valdovinos is a wonderful young man. He was courteous and composed. He did his job efficiently with care.
I would like to congratulate the Rooter Hero company for hiring such a fine person.
Thank you for your service and may God bless you.
