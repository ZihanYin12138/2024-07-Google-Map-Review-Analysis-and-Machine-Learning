Before I used to come here all the time when the staff was more pleasant and helpful. I truly miss the old manager Anna. Now when I come here the staff is always talking amongst themselves and on their cell phones. The other day I was in a hurry and tired from a long day at work. I was greeted by Tanya she is a new hire. Very nice girl she was trying to assist me in what I needed which was just a SIM card she called out for her manager on duty CARA who was busy flirting and touching hands with her other employee and then takes her phone out and starts scrolling. After Tanya's second attempt to get her attention with no luck, I raised my voice and said hey girl she's calling you. She looked at me very rude came over did not apologize and stood with attitude helping out the new hire with my issue. I as a manager in retail would never allow my new hires to feel like they cannot call me for help and i would be a better example to the employees. This isn't the first time I have had bad experiences while going there. There are a few staff members who are helpful but the majority are very ill-mannered.<//Text>

I walked into the store and the entire place smells like feces.  Spoke to the employees and they were definitely not customer service friendly left the place as soon as possible and I suggest you go to any other T-Mobile store< /Text>

<Text>Had a very unprofessional and inconvenient experience.

I’ll spare google of the details, but I would definitely suggest going to an actual T-Mobile retailer, not a third-party (which this is, Ritmo Latino Wireless llc).
I’ve been in here multiple times and they always have an unreal line.
The general attitude is, “we will get to you eventually,” since you have no choice but to wait or leave.
Terrible. Don’t come here, don’t put your name on the list and wait unless you have nothing better to do.

Don’t just take my word for it:</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The moment I walked in to TMobile in Ontario on Euclid I was greeted by Javier and was informed of how many customers were ahead of me. Then as the customers were helped he’d continue to check in to let me know where I was in line to be attended. It was nice to be acknowledged instead of feeling ignored and wondering when I‘d be helped. Once it was my turn Claudia assisted me and was friendly, patient and helpful and please keep in mind that the store closes at 8pm and it was my turn around 7:45pm. I came to TMobile to transfer my services from Sprint so it wasn’t going to be an in and out service. I felt bad that she would reassure me that it was ok and was really nice about staying late after closing… I ended up leaving after 9pm and am beyond impressed with how professional and generous the staff was. Great job TMobile team… I am happy to have made the switch of phone providers!</text>

Which I knew the amount I owed  and asked why it was lower and they just told me it was less like if i had no clue what i owed got home and called 611 to check and make sure about the amount and sure enough i owed more ( that amount i knew i owed ) an hour later went back and waited almost an hour so i can pay the difference . Never coming here again they need to train there people well .. what a wast of my time<//Text>

<Review>The atmosphere was fine but smelled like cigarettes the whole time with people smoking right outside the tent. They also were NOT checking temperature. The beer was boring with lack of variety and basically only domestic pale ales/lagers. We didn’t try the chicken but the food was expensive for it being pretty bland and took a long time to get to us.

On the plus side, we liked the large portions that gave us the shareable bar food feel.  The server was very attentive and seemed like a good guy but we won’t be going back and wouldn’t recommend to friends.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b880a04d46a1:0x621b8479e08bdb75<//gmap_id></record>

They have turned their parking lot into alfresco dining. Really cool vibe for night time snacking.</Review>

Two stars for low cost diesel fuel. but I could not find the actual diesel pump. It was not near the normal pumps that you see at every other gas station. I went inside to ask if they had the diesel pump anywhere and the guy said yes, it’s right out there in the corner. It was way off at the edge of the parking lot with no sign or green color indication. Plus the sun was setting so it was lined up perfectly as the sun was blinding at sunset..
I said,
OK and went outside to find that there is no card reader or anything. You would think that he would mention that I need to pay first inside instead of let me walk all the way across to the desolate 1985 style pump with no sign on it.
because it was way off in the corner with no sign or green colored indication that it was for diesel. Plus the sun was setting so it was easy to miss as it was on the west side of the parking lot. I went back inside to pay and asked the guy why didn’t he tell me that I have to pay first, and he says,
“You asked me where the pump was and that’s all I need to tell you”
Great customer service from British Petroleum gas station employee. There’s a reason why he’s a gas station employee with an attitude like that.< /review>

The $.35 debit fee makes me leave there and go to Shell where gas costs more but I can use my debit card for free. BUT Arco is still my goto.<//text>

<Date>1608857757118< /Date><Review>ARCO has car washing building that does a good job.  The line was longer than I wanted to wait, but this time we were the second car in line.

The line to the washing area has a interface screen where you slide you credit card into the slot and then select the options for the car washing information you want is entered.  After the washing instructions end, the light on the moving machine instructs you to move forward until the you it displays stop.

The time it takes to wash is dependant upon the options you select.
When moving machine and its brushes stop and the water blowing ducts begin to howl, you are instructed to move forward.  There is a timer just outside the exit area that shows how much time is left in the blower.  This is intended to help you understand how to pace your movement through the blowing area streams so enough water is removed in most places on the car before the blowers stop blowing air.< /Review>< user_name>

Love ARCO!  Cinnamon coffee is the best... seriously.  It's a medium roast with a slight hint of cinnamon.  The stores are always open and you can get what you need.</text>

<Text>We had a flat tire during car wash. The hole was so huge that tire was flat completely in 5 minutes. Manager didn't believe us and said many cars had car wash that day. We went inside car wash area and found that there are sharp iron edges. It is possible for cars which are to the right to have a cut. Manager still didn't agree with us and said that she will let her technician inspect and get back to us. This is a brand new tire as you can see nice car threads with hole in the below picture. This flat tire definitely happened inside car wash because air pressure sensor turned on when we are exiting the car wash and it only took 5 minutes for complete flat tire.  Hopefully they will refund my tire.

Update: Manager made technician inspect car wash and found no objects which could cause flat tire (but I'm 100% sure we had flat tire inside car wash because my car has air pressure indicator which started as we exit the car wash and hole was so huge that tire was completely flat in 4 minutes). Manager reimbursed some cash for flat tire repair, but couldn't fix the huge hole.<//Text>< gmapID>

What kind of scrub 24 hour gas station has to close for an hour for “end of day”? I guess that would make you guys open 23 hours a day. The gas worked fine, i guess.</Review>

Unlisted on maps but does have Diesel for sale. Store is clean, staff is friendly, to the people complaining about credit cards: no AMPM takes them, not a valid complaint. My only issue and its minor is the Diesel pump is way off from the other pumps in a rather dark area and diesel isn't even on the main sign. But once I found out no issues.</review>

<text>Surprised my girl and took her bike shopping over the weekend. I was super happy to find what we were looking for at a decent price. Andres was really helpful and positive.  He even hooked it up with a spare tool for the bike seat. We were able to get two bikes and a brand new bike rack all set up and ready to ride the same afternoon.

They say the first time is key in creating engagement with clients and they totally missed their chance with me. Took two bikes for a tuneup on 12/20 and the guy who was there is in serious need of costumer service training. As I took the first bike to their door he looked at me and asked me what was wrong with the bikes and I stated I was there just for a regular tuneup he rolled his eyes and said no, you need to fill a service ticket and return in about two weeks, no explanation whatsoever and then returned to what he was doing. I then went to Frank’s and even though they’re busier - open slots until February - the way he treated me was so different, took time to explain and even suggest two other stores where I could go.

So I’ll take my business to Frank’s and never return to your shop<//text>

{'time': 1612591490063, 'text': 'Hey Antonio I’m sorry for the bad interaction you had at our shop. We’ve been super slammed since April and although that doesn’t explain or justify your experience it’s the reality of what we’re dealing with. I’m glad you were able to get bike serviced. We have seemed to get our volume back under control and hopefully at some point you’ll allow us to help you. In the meantime it’s great that you’re back on the bike. Enjoy the ride!'}<//Response>

What an amazing place.  I wanted to ship a Bicycle out of state.  Not only were they able to disassemble and pack to bike for transport, they provided me detailed instructions on how to contact UPS for the appropriate paperwork.  The bike was delivered and is now in the hands of my daughter.  My first experience with this shop is when I bought cycle shoes for my spinning class.  The shoes the recommended fit well and have provided me many happy hours of spinning.  The staff was amazing and helpful.  Not only was the owner on sight managing,  which I always like, because that will ensure quality management.  This is a quality establishment.<//Text>

< Review>
I was in last week looking for a  new bike for my son in the store for 10 minutes and not a soul asked what i needed help with, Poor customer service so I took my business to frank's bicycles where i was greeted at the door as I walked in and employees were very helpful and informative about their products.</Review>

these guys are freaking awesome. not only do they take care of me in as timely a manner as they can they are not afraid to take their time with me when I need a little extra help or a 'quick' lecture covering all the essential necessities of bicycle wheel truing... they have had my back in some of the most absurd circumstances even going so far -on at least one occasion- as to fabricate a part to my exact specifications  {at home!} {in their own spare time!!}} after exhaustive searches found that what i needed was just not very easily obtained. the owner can be a little grumpy at times but he is an alright guy, unless he catches you yelling at his employees. i would give this establishment TEN stars, but hacking google is prolly not a good way to promote my good health and freedom....CHEERS TYLER!! YOU EARNED IT! (the pictures I have included here are bikes I have built with their assistance)<//review>

<text>I had went to several shops looking for a specific type of bicycle. A 26" Women's road bike that's not too feminine. This was a diamond in the rough. Thanks to Mark Mendez who showed me different types of models and had my interests in mind and not just making a sale. Now I'm all over L.A and loving it.< /text>< time>

Sorry folks, I don't care how good the work is, if they won't take back unused parts, that's BS! They have ZERO signs posted ANYWHERE saying they won't take back parts, except written tiny at the very bottom of their receipt, so after you've paid already (salesperson sure never said anything). It was a seat post clamp that, when fully tightened to the last thread, still wouldn't stop the seat post from moving.  Brought it back 2 days later--"sorry, store credit only." Come on, seriously?< /Review>

Love my Liv bicycle! The folks at the shop were all friendly and helpful, and I did not feel pressured to buy-up. The salesperson followed my lead without being pushy, and so I left the shop with just the bike I’d been dreaming of. Many thanks!</Review>

These guys are awesome. They stock lots of tools and parts. They even went as far as opening parts to ensure they were compatible with what I had brought in. They tend to stock brand name stuff so it may seem pricey but its competitive with online prices and the quaility is worth it. Great shop and unlike other shops in the area they actually carry mountain bike parts< /Review>

<Text>Steve the owners is a very rude and sour man, one of his employees told me I wasn’t the first to feel like he was not best with people. If you read others negative reviews almost everyone complains about the man that should be a role model “Steve the owner” for the employees. What a shame!<//Text><Rating>1<//Rating><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

I purchased an electric bike online and it needed to be assembled. So we called the bike shop to inquire if they could do it. Not only did they say they could do it. They allowed us to have the bike shipped directly to the shop. Mark assembled the bike and also gave fantastic instruction on how to operate the bike. I will only shop at this bike shop. They have earned a loyal customer. I would rate it ten stars or more if I could!</review><userid>108207869501980283498</userid></record>

🌞❤Hello everyone!!! A blast from the past(so to speak),more than kind,courteous service!!! It seems like that anyway:if they don't have something in stock they can get it Quick Enough!!! It appears they have a good selection!!! I ordered 2 Park Tool disc brake tools,and I will get them in 2 or 3 days!!! I like them,what ever La Habra Cyclery don't have,I get there!!! TAKE CARE,B SAFE  EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!! 😃📿❤👍✌🇺🇸🎗</Review>

I went into The Cyclery Bike Shop 7 years ago to purchase my first bike from the shop. Steve and Tyler went above and beyond to help. They didn't just sell me a bike they took the time to find out my level of riding skill and intended riding. Tyler suggested a few different models and had me ride them to help make my decision. I have since over the year's purchased 8 more bike's. With the support of the shop I have become not only a customer for life but a friend for life.</Text>

<Review>I purchased my 11 yr old son's first BMX bike from here.  The service, the personal attention to my concerns, and the overall experience made a lasting impression.  I just purchased another bike for my son (now 12yrs old) from here and I will always come here.  This kind of personal attention you don't think get online.  Keep up the great work! It does make a difference.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
I took my bicycle and my brother's for a tuneup.
They told us that they will check and inspected the entire bicycle for any possible damages or Adjustments.  They said that tuneup price is $39.99.
Our bicycles stayed a full week at the shop till we received a call, telling me that our bicycles were ready and fix.  They said that my bicycle was in good conditions and that they check the entire bicycle and nothing was wrong.  But they still charged me $39.00
Wen they really did nothing on my bicycle.
When I try to ride it the next day at the Fullerton-loop the chain broke and the  cassette was loosed, at the front rim, five spokes were loose too and the rear rim 3 spokes were also loose.  So, they never did anything to my bicycle but they did charged me for nothing.  I had to take my bicycle to another shop and spend $120.00 to get it fix.
And on my brother 's bicycle it was almost the same story they charged the $39.99 for the tuneup plus $35.00 for changing a brake cable.  It was all they did because they also did not perform the tuneup on the bicycle.  So the total charged for my brothers bicycle was like $76.00.
So they end up charging us $120.00 for a break wire replacement.  It's pretty bad how easy this place makes money with non-professional and  unresponsive people.<//review>

A really good experience from a really bad situation.  My 9 yr old daughters back wheel was stolen off of the bike we had gotten for her last birthday.  It was her first really "big" bike and it was a Liv brand name (owned by Giant).  My daughter was really upset so I did my best to get her another wheel that matched.  I called the Cyclery bike shop and told them what happened.  They were great.  The did their best to find me a matching wheel from their factory connections and when they couldn't they gave me a great discount on a replacement set.  Everyone was extremely nice about the situation and they really went out of their way to help me as best they could.< /text>

Ok have to give them a 5 star .  I started to get back into biking.  I have some really old bike, like 25 year old bikes.  Got a tune up for both my mountain bike and road bike.  Paul got them working pretty good again.  After a few trips on the Fullerton loop, I thought it would be a good idea to update my mountain bike.  Paul , Mannuel, steve the owner and everyone there were very helpful as I asked a lot of questions and went back more than a few times.  Ended up getting a full suspension Giant Stance 2.  They helped me understand what I was buying and why other bikes maybe were not the best choice .  There pricing was a little less than what I could find online.  My first ride today on my new bike was great.  This is now my bike shop . Thanks</Text>

Absolutely HORRIBLE service.  Dropped two bikes off for tune up(Basically tubes and tires).  Was told Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.  Called Thursday and "still three bikes ahead of me".  Also told that its First in First Out.  Called Today(Saturday) and told "Two bikes in front of me".  So since Thursday they've been able to do ONE bike???   Picked up my bikes and there was four guys "working".  Just standing around chatting.   Poor Service.  Being LIED to.  Avoid this place at ALL COSTS!!! I know I will.< /Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1499956491072, 'text': "Hey Mike thanks for your input and I'm really sorry you had a bad experience. The reason so few bikes moved is that we often have bikes that go on the rack then find out that they need parts special ordered and when those parts come in we put them back in the spot they were in which sometimes slows the movement of bikes I had in front of you. It's not that were lying to you but if someone brought their bike in before you and then their parts came in we feel it's appropriate to put them back in the slot where they were as opposed to sending them back to the end of the line. We're currently running 20 to 30 bikes in our system and we're not able to get them out as soon as we would like but we try our best and again I'm sorry it wasn't what you would have liked but I assure you nobody is lying to you.\nIf you have any questions please feel free to call me directly my name is Steve and I'm the owner of the shop and my phone number is 562-943-2453\nThank you!"}<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd2b53b1c993c9:0x2d6e899e53927f29< /gmapID></record>

Always helpful and knowledgeable. They don't try to rip you off either, service is where they excel. I wish the selection of products was better though (more safety products, cool backpacks, bright lights), it's pretty run of the mill stuff.< /review>

He was helpful and didn't seem to mind that I was just stopping in to stop in. Later I met Steve and was was able to bounce ideas off him. He'd been racing for a long time and back then I was very into racing. Now I actually work there and honestly almost didn't make a review because I do. I recently worked at another bike shop in La Puente and the main reason for the switch was the vibe. Imo the cyclery is what i like most about cycling. A bunch of geeks that love bikes and don't mind talking to  anyone whether you race or it's your first bike.< /text><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Went there about three times total. The first time went without a hitch and they were friendly. Next two times started going downhill. I went for tune-up and they instantly told me that I needed a new chain and rear cassette. The chain was old so that was understandable but the cassette wasn't really worn out and I even got a second opinion from another shop. They also also supposedly trued my disc brake rotor and adjusted cable tension but I'm positive they barely laid there hands on it especially since the rotor was not any better. So that "tune-up" money down the drain. The owner was also very condescending and disrespectful towards my friend's less expensive bike saying he should really save up and get a "real bike". Unbelievable. It shouldn't matter what he's riding as long as he has fun and is out there enjoying it. The third and final time trying to give them another chance, I went to ask for advise on a Cannondale hardtail  I was considering to buy. I was looking to buy it "used" from a neighbor and described to the shop owner that it was pretty much brand new (rode once) and released the year before. The owner almost instantly started to dissuade me from getting it saying complete bs things like the front fork could be recalled and that the only safe option was getting it from a shop and that he would "knock down the price" if I bought it there. Was looking for simple advise whether it was a solid bike for the price and all he did was talk it down and try to sell me his items. The owner really needs to work on his customer service skills and stop condescending people. He may have a lot of experience but that goes nowhere when he tries way  too hard to take your money. As a previous review said, owner reallly needs to work on people skills and stop being rude.< /Review>

<review>The manager here is top notch. I have no fashion sense and rarely need to wear suits so this stuff can be intimidating. He helped me pick out two that fit perfectly, looked great, were in my price range and gave me some great tips in less than an hour - and he made it fun.< /review><resp>None< /resp><user_id>114415924438885871046</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Very friendly and helpful staff. Bought my first suit here and they helped me find one with my budget - no pressuring for more than I could afford which I greatly appreciated. Also were more than willing to fit me for a tux for a wedding where the rental was going to be from another company - the gentleman fitting me was very knowledgeable and helpful and had no issues with taking the time to do my measurements despite my rental being from another company. I thought that was gracious of them. All in all a good experience for a first timer and will certainly come back.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Such an over-priced place and staff will try to sell what they have and not what you need.  We spent nearly $800. on 1 outfit which included the lowest priced items they had.  (3 shirts, 2 ties, a belt, 2 pr. socks, 1 pr. pants and a sport coat)  There was NO wiggle room in the snug shirts and jacket so when my son gained 10#, the shirts and jacket were too small!  The salesman SHOULD have suggested the next larger size since everything was already snug.  Never going back there but it was an urgent occasion that an outfit was needed for.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Always friendly and attentive service. I prefer getting my business clothes here because of the help and knowledgeable advice from the staff. Much better then trying to shop at the big department stores where it is almost impossible to find knowledgeable help.</text>

I walked in and did not have any help for about 20 minutes, i just browsed the selections for that time. Finally someone comes over an asked if I needed some help in a very casual manner, not like they really wanted to help. The prices are high and the service is mediocre.

<text>I was a groomsmen at a wedding and they got my order wrong and on top of that they took my tie and suspenders for no reason when I was trying the suit on and never put it back in the package. I was the only person at the wedding that did not have the correct attire and it was due to under trained staff that assumed instead of just going by the order. I spent way to much and got nothing back for the gaint mistake. We called and they told us tuff what do you want us to do we cant fix this. We all had to buy new ties so we would match and could not wear our suspenders as planned.

They still charged full price and never apologized. When I returned it I told them and they had no clue there was an issue.

To much stress and money I would go somewhere else. Also they have terrible customer service beware!!!!< /text>< pictures>

<review>Came in through the door and didn't receive a greeting. What seemed to be a new guy who went straight to business and skipped the step of introducing himself until the end when I was ready to leave, however, he did seem to mean well. Everyone was a little awkward but very nice and helpful. Very clean place but not the best Men's Wearhouse out there.<//review>< UserId.>

This review will cover multiple stores that my groomsmen and I had poor experiences with.
Thousand Oaks
Roseville
Santa Barbara
Oxnard

Bottom line for those of you who don’t want to read it all..... boy, there has to be another company! 😡

1.  We locked in a deal for $202 per groomsmen and Santa Barbara tried to charge my best man $402. Luckily he called BS. Oxnard successfully charge my other buddy $350
2. Oxnard provided Greg with a sweaty smelly shirt to try on 🤮
3. When Greg tried to iron the shirt he finally received, it immediately melted and was destroyed. Plastic junk.

Here’s my #1 problem and why I’ll never go back.......
My son’s shirt was too big and pants were too small, which is not a big deal. We were leaving the next morning for our destination wedding so I had Jose from the Thousand Oaks store overnight the replacements to my dad in Roseville who was leaving later than us.
Unfortunately Jose seemed to know very little so i had to call the next morning to make sure everything was ok....
1 day later Dad was notified that they arrived and yet when he arrived to pick them up he was told there was no shipment whatsoever and even when I spoke to the rep, he said that they had opened every delivery and the computer showed no record whatsoever. 😡 Now I called Thousand Oaks to find out what happened and there’s Jose to take my call. I explain the problem and he says “there’s no way we would have shipped it there by today. No one would have done that. The earliest it will get there is 3 days from now.” 🤬🤬🤬🤬 clearly it was time for some serious action!!!  I told him to find someway, anyway to fix it immediately. He said he would try but it still wouldn’t get there for three days.... He put me on hold and then came back on to say... “oh, looks like it was delivered today.” 😡
After finally giving me the tracking number I called Roseville store....

Turns out Roseville did have the order!  They had  signed for it and just screwed the pooch! 😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤯🤯🤬🤯🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬😡🤬
1. If Roseville wasn’t incompetent most of this could have been avoided.
2. If Jose at Thousand Oaks wasn’t half decent I wouldn’t have had to call back to check his work.
3. If Jose at Thousand Oaks wasn’t completely incompetent, he could have easily fixed the problem by quickly looking it up before he spewed a bunch of BS!!! “I’m sorry, let me look this up and find out what’s going on.”

Again, the bottom line is..... do everything you can to find another company.  It’s incredibly clear that this company has a complete lack of training & accountability.< /review>

I came in from out of town for a wedding.  My final experience was with this location and Dan and Eric specifically were incredible.  After I returned to Arizona I realized I left some very important and expensive shoe insoles with my rental.  Dan went out of his way when he was busy to find them, then Eric sent them off to my local MW location, so I didn't have to pay for shipping.  Thanks guys!  You Rock!
I only wish I had know sooner... When I came into town I didnt know the area and I chose to pickup a missing piece of my tux rental at the Thousand Oaks location and that was a big mistake. I had to come back the next day because they couldnt find the vest for my tux, even though it had been "checked in."  On top of that they weren't very polite.  Well the guys at this location were awesome...  I should have just gone there in the first place</review>

I have shopped at Mens Wearhouse in the past and have always found their prices to be very competitive and selection excellent.  It had been sometime since I had purchased a new suit and accessories and was prepared to make a day of it, thinking that the process would be tedious and time consuming.  I was 100% percent wrong!  Jose De Haro was an immense help in selecting the appropriate attire (he might be a mind reader) and made the whole transaction Fun and Smooth!
From now on I won't shop anywhere else other than where Jose is!
Thank you Jose!< /Text>

This entire experience was first rate: the person who scheduled the job, and Chris (the tech) were both great. I would rate the service 5 out of 5 stars
Chris is very knowledgeable plus he arrived on time; analyzed the problem and solved it. As a P.E (mechanical) I appreciate his professional approach to diagnosing and then solving the problem efficiently.</text>

John Owens and crew are absolutely the most professional and trustworthy HVAC contractors.
We had an HVAC system installed in a 1982 era house that was previously heated with baseboard heaters and a wood stove. After John Owens installed our new system we have a perfectly heated home.
-Thank you to all< /text>

I spent two months trying to troubleshoot a non-functioning sauna heater, and was laughed off the phone by company after company when I mentioned we live in Bolinas. I was able to narrow down the issue, ordered replacement parts, and luckily John Owens Services was able to book an appointment and take on the job. The technician, Chris, was fantastic, replacing the various parts (in a very tight and inhospitable spot!) with a smile on his face. Overall, the company is fairly priced, communicates extremely well by phone/text, and at the end of the day, delivers the goods.<//Text>

The phone staff, estimator, and the engineer were great. When install day arrived, the techs were on time and I was blown away by how courteous and respectful they both were. True superstars.

My AC is up and running and I love my new thermostat. So glad I picked John Owens!<//Text><user_id>105918436703971436077< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

Tim, one of John Owen's technicians, was so empathetic to our situation and diagnosed the issue quickly and lined up someone to come replace the heater the following day.

John Owens Services utterly failed to do the job. The technician came out to fix a failed wall heater, ran error codes and then dismantled and took parts of the unit back to their shop. But he never returned. More than eight months went by and despite my repeated requests for John Owens Services to finish the job, they just kept finding excuses not to. We were left without heat. Don't make the mistake of calling John Owens Services.

The have an extensive fleet of Mercedes vans and are pushing to grow the company and so, it seems to me, they grossly overcharge. They wanted $2706 flat rate fee just for labor (plus the price of the unit) to replace the old heater with an identical new one! A job that might take an hour or two. It should cost a couple hundred bucks. NOT $2706. What a rip-off.

Here are quotes taken from reviews of John Owens Services written by other local residents:

"I had a VERY BAD experience with this company today. BEWARE!"
...
I called John Owens to register a complaint. The man on the phone was aggressively defensive and told me that their costs of maintaining an office, trucks, phones, paying workman's comp and salaries led them to charge the kind of prices they did. Price gouging is what I call it.”
...
"Slow, over-priced, try to con me into things I don't need, didn't come back to finish the job.
They never called and never came back.  Overpriced, unreliable, unresponsive. I would never pay these people to come to my house again.”
...
"No show on the appointment day. I get they are busy but if they are that lazy with first appointment why would i trust them to do my work?  Ryan clearly did not want the business. And by the looks of the reviews it seems this is not uncommon."
…
"Technicians are great - owner does bait-and-switch billing."
…
"I have an emergency and was told they would be here and they cancelled. Thanks for wasting our time and not doing anything. You suck”
…
"I am going to contact Rinnai to have John Owens removed from their list of authorized repair contractors as he refused to service my water heater without a valid reason"<//Text>
<pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1609279177281, 'text': 'There are always two views in every situation.  We have been in business in Marin since 1986 and an authorized dealer for these Rinnai direct furnaces for 21 years. The heater was very old and had failed because the space was being used as a woodshop and the heater has been breathing sawdust. We declined to repair or replace the heater months ago because at that time we deemed the location hazardous ( i know it is now cleaned up). There were no excuses, we declined to do the job, and did not take any parts out of the heater. I have photographs of when it was a hazardous location. The gentleman recently said he did not want to work with us on the project and I provided names and phone numbers of two other Rinnai dealers that he could work with.  Most of my Mercedes trucks are twenty years old, and  of our hundreds of reviews reflect our reasonable pricing. Thank you.'}</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>John Owens is the best heating and plumbing contractor in the Bay Area. I've hired him personally and on behalf of my clients to solve problems and install HVAC. John's company is especially gifted with the ability to diagnose, repair and  install radiant heating systems.

Excellent service and very professional!!! Honesty like I haven't seen before in along time. Although they could've tried to sell me on unnecessary services they did not and advised that we could continue to use our current HVAC even though it was an older model. My bosses as well as myself are extremely happy with the service we received and would definitely recommend John Owens Services to anyone and we will definitely be suing them again in the future!!!<//Review>

<text>The folks at John Owens Services are top notch.  I had a complicated AC setup with a no attic space to go with a traditional setup.  Chris and Alex worked with me to run countless scenarios of what system would work best - ductless mini splits.

After we knew the system, they again were very patient going through all the pricing options (and I asked for many) until we decided on the right one.

As for the install, Ivan and his team were super professional, timely and got the job done right.  I can’t recommend them enough.

I love that I called for maintenance on my Rinai heater a year later and got a scheduled within 3 days.   I got a follow up call the day before Matt came out. On time , friendly and punctual.  In and out in a jiffy.   Highly recommend John and his team!<//Text>

<Text>My house heating boiler made an explosion. This happened in Mill Valley during the shelter in place order, and John Owens Services responded promptly.
Tim came out that same morning to diagnose the problem. I needed a new boiler and he gave me an estimate. A+ experience/service.
Alex then came out to finalize the parts needed and schedule the replacement to start the next day. (Excellent)
Cesar and his helper came the next day. They did an awesome job. Courteous, clean, on time, clearly a craftsman that takes pride in the quality of the work he does.<//Text>< Resp>

I called in with a broken AC in the midst of a 110 degree heat wave. The kind receptionist told me she would try to get an appointment in the coming week. In 5  days Dale drove the John Owens truck to us and took 30 minutes to diagnose and replace a faulty capacitor. Now that was great service. We were cool again just in time.< /text>

I am experienced in home remodeling and construction and as a lawyer and a long time homeowner I am fairly picky about details. I was very pleased with the estimate process and the work. John Owens Services hit all the marks on value and are especially good with their communication and availability. I had a furnace replaced and upgraded and it went well, was done on time (early actually) and I like the free one year service and the warranty. Highly recommended.</Text>

<Review>My ac unit stopped working and I suspected the compressor had finally given up-- the age of the system was 22 years.  Eric was the technician that came out. He was extremely competent and thorough. He completed a systematic diagnostic assessment, explaining every step of the way.  He confirmed that the compressor was struggling and drawing significant current on start-up, which was tripping the circuit breaker.  However, the primary issue was a faulty capacitor. Eric replaced the capacitor, added a kickstart capacitor and had the unit operational within 30 minutes. I will now hopefully get another 2 years out of this system before requiring replacement. Thank you Eric!<//Review>< user>

<Text>They are very pricey!... That said, they do beautiful work.  We had both our radiant heating and hot water replaced with a on demand hot water system and boiler.  For the first time we have even heat through out our entire house, the system looks absolutely amazing.  I'm very happy with the finished job, and their staff is extremely friendly and informative.  I highly recommend John's team, I will be adding them to our HOA's preferred vendor list.< /Text>< pictures>

Very friendly and responsive. They unfortunately were not my first call, but ended up being the best call I made that day. They helped me the same day where others could not help for up to a week or more unless I was willing to pay for emergency service. Do yourself a big favor and call John Owens first.</text>

The other companies I have been trying to work with we’re not professionals and gave bad advice.  Crooks are out there and I have dealt with some.  So glad to have found this company!

He was in my house for 3 hours and fifteen minutes,  and replaced $50 in local retail parts costs.  The charge for parts, travel and labor was about $560.

< Review>
So after a few Fire Seasons here in Sonoma County & being without Power, complicated by having a Well & Septic System, I decided to purchase a Portable 12,500 Watt Back Up Generator 👍
I soon came to realize the many issues using Gasoline or Propane.
The good news is that I was able to convert it to Natural Gas but now needed a “Hook-Up Source”...
After 3 very expensive quotes to run 3/4” Black Pipe, I called John Owens with a different idea using a HD Flexible Generator approved hose.
WOW!  Glad I did!
Same Day Response, Same Day Installation and all at a very fair price!!
Juan, (the Service Tech) was GREAT!
Very thorough.... re-lite the gas appliances and “We Are Good To Go”!!
Their name goes into my “Contacts”!!
Thanks!
John Owens Services will be the one I call for my next project👍<//Review>

<Text>They were prompt, polite and did a good job.But In explaining my situation
to the gentleman on the phone (replace
a couple fittings under the sink and install a new faucet) he had no clue to
give a rough estimate which I wanted.
When the tech showed up he said it would take about 1 1/2 hrs, it took 2
and no problem. But when I got the bill
for $500.00 I was shocked. Will not
recommend.... got ripped off !!!!</Text><name>John Imschweiler</name><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

Our Furnace went out, and I decided to give John Owens services a try given all the positive reviews.  I have to say they lived up to the reviews.  The woman who answered the phone was very helpful, and I had my appointment scheduled within minutes.  Shortly after I was sent a confirmation email with a name and photo of my technician- Chris Burke.  The next morning Chris showed up right on time and on point.  He was extremely professional and friendly.  Given my furnace was 30 years old, I appreciated his thoroughness in checking all the components, not only the failed piece to ensure the safety of my family.   He clearly knew what he was doing and wasted no time in getting it up and running!  It’s been running smoothly ever since!  At times it seems like it can be hard to find honest professionals that take pride in their work and have integrity.  Chris and the John Owens company were awesome and have my consideration for any future work that I may come across.    Thank you for doing great work at a reasonable price!< /review>

Absolutely top of the line customer service from beginning to end. We were without heat for almost a week, when I called JOSI thanks to another company who charged us without fixing the problem. From the first phone call to the end of the installation, everyone from JOSI was respectful, knowledgeable, punctual, responsive, and simply treated me like a person, not just another "sale". We ended up needing a complete furnace replacement for a 21 year old furnace. On top of everything the final bill came in lower than the estimate! It was a very stressful situation for me in that the furnace was in the attic only accessible through my master closet ceiling, and JOSI made it not only bearable, but actually a positive experience in that we now had heat again! I highly recommend JOSI to anyone and everyone needing HVAC services! Thank you JOSI!<//review>

<Review>Our old furnace in West Marin gave out a couple weeks ago, leaving us waking to very chilly mornings and spending evenings in down jackets. A contractor friend recommended John Owens Services, who sent a technician out the next day. He arrived on time, diagnosed the problem (severe corrosion) and walked us through repair vs replace scenarios. We decided to replace, and a second tech came the next day  to discuss replacement options and take measurements. We did some research and selected a model, which JOS ordered that day and scheduled installation for two business days later. Two installers arrived when promised, finished removal and new installation in about 5 hours, cleaned up and were gone. I liked that every visit was preceded by a text estimating arrival time. All JOS personnel (including the folks in the office) were polite, knowledgeable, and on time. I was impressed and pleased and highly recommend JOS.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<date>1581278215165< /date><rating>5< /rating><text>This is our first encounter with John Owns Services. We were referred to them from the Trane Website as our local dealer to help install a new Trane Air Conditioning Unit to our existing Trane Forced-Air Heater.

Chris, HVAC designer came out the same day and assessed our 1974 home. He determined that we needed to update our vents to provide the best air flow. No other HVAC contractor mentioned this important factor. He also recommended the best size of unit for our needs.

Alex, project manager, came out the next day to perform a thorough assessment of our existing system including specific measurements and drawings to assist the installation team. His thoroughness is impressive.

Juan and Angel performed the installation. They are amazing. They are a true team. They enjoy their work (which is dirty and dangerous) and want to provide the same level of professionalism and craftsmanship as if it were their own home.

They took it upon themselves to remodel our basement area in order to create the best, most serviceable area for our Heating and Air Conditioning systems. This required relocating the existing Heating Unit, installing new/larger electrical service, etc which required 100' runs under the house!

The basement area is just about inaccessible. It is located at the opposite end of our home which is on a very steep hillside. Every trip with materials, etc. had to be hand carried about 100' from our driveway.

In order to carry the huge Trane A/C unit they dug a 50 foot dirt trail along the steep hillside. With each of them on opposite sides of the heavy, awkward unit they, and two helpers, painstakingly maneuvered the unit down dangerous, uneven stairs and along the dirt trail and underneath a wooden deck to the correct position. It was like watching an act from Cirque de Soleil.

According to Alex, this type of installation would normally take at least three days. Juan and Angel, working 10 to 12 hour days, completed it in two.

We needed to install a new return which was over 85 feet long. We also needed a new floor register. Each situation required on the spot innovation and design decisions.

Juan and Angel never complained nor appeared to require hand-holding from management. They adapted.

At the end of the day, a contractor is as good as his sub-contractors. In this case, John Owens is very fortunate to have found such dedicated and skilled craftsman.

We feel good about supporting a local San Rafael contractor! John Owens can provide warranty service, as well as, a wide variety of other contracting services and that makes us feel secure.

Thank you Chris, Alex, Juan and Angel. We remember you every time we use our Trane System!

In a word -- amazing!  John's team - Tim and team were responsive and knowledgeable.  They went the extra mile on every front to make sure our air conditioner was up and running and installed perfectly.  They were attentive to every detail for the installation. I would highly recommend John and his team.  I also felt i got the very best value for my money.  I wouldn't use anyone else.< /review>

We had a great experience with John Owens Services. When we realized we needed a new on demand water heater very soon as ours was leaking and was going to fail at any minute,  I first called a plumber who had done some work for us in the past and did a great job.  He referred us to John Owens indicating that they specialize in water heaters.  My husband is very knowledgeable about mechanical things and was very selective about who we hired, I own my own business so am particular about working with people and companies who act professionally.  John Owens Services provided great work, prompt service and very friendly people - both in the office and in the field.  I found John Owens Services also  to be competitively priced too.</text>

Excellent professional job replacing a 22 year old water heater with a new unit.   Very long complicated job because of calcium buildups over the years but no extra charge from the original estimate.  Chris was very business like and very neat - left the area spotless.</text>

<review>Great communication with me during whole process.  Their bid was not the lowest nor the highest, but when you looked at it closely it was definitely the best considering the warranty that they offer.  The technicians were great about answering all of my questions.

<text>John Owens Services provided the lowest bid by far out of 3 to replace my furnace and did it in a very timely manner before the cold snap. I would recommend them based on that, which is most important. I deducted a star because the installers left cigarette butts and orange peels in my yard, trash in the basement (including a cigarette pack), and forgot to plug in my sump pump, so my basement flooded - easily fixed by plugging it back in, but still.<//text>< Rating>

I've been remiss in not having posted this review in September, when JOHN OWENS SERVICES came to our rescue.  And, while I want to emphasize what a great company I've found John Owens Services to be, I want to set the back story of how I found them.

My wife and I had a Trane central heating and air conditioning system installed in a portion of our home by a Novato Trane dealer in 2017.  In July, 2019, during that company's annual System Maintenance Inspection, we mentioned to their lead technician that during the cooling cycle, unlike during the past two summers, the system's fan was putting out an incredible rush of air and associated noise from our registers. It was so loud that it was difficult to carry on a normal conversation at our dining table, and it made it necessary for us to use ear plugs to sleep during the hot nights.

I asked the technician if the flow rate could have somehow been switched from a lower level.  He said that wasn't possible, that nothing could be done, and that he thought the unit they'd installed was too large for that part of our house.

In early August, I contacted the Company's owner/office manager to tell her about our problem.  At her request, I emailed her a video, showing the situation, and she said that they'd get back to me on the following Monday. Not hearing back for a week, I called again, and she said her husband was out of the office, but that she'd let him know I'd called.  Again, never hearing back, I called and left messages several more times over the next month.

Finally, after two months of complete frustration, I gave up on getting a response from the Novato Trane dealer, and began looking for another company.  Luckily, I discovered John Owens on Google, and after reading a number of reviews, gave them a call.

I explained our situation, and asked if someone could please come out to at least evaluate the problem.  They agreed to send a technician out that Friday, and Jared showed up right on schedule.  Once I turned the system on so that he could see and hear the problem, Jared took about 20 minutes to determine the cause, and make the necessary adjustments.  Turns out that the system's fan had been set for a 3-ton AC system, rather than our 2-ton system.  The fix seems to have been a simple one, at least for a technician who knows what he's doing. Jared was not only knowledgeable and efficient, but also very courteous and upbeat.  So, happily, we now have a Heating/AC system that works beautifully AND a new HVAC company - John Owens Services!</Text>

We recently replaced our old water heater with a tankless water heater installed by John Owens Services. The whole operation went very smoothly, from the original contact with Alex who answered all my questions and planned the installation to the the techs who did the actual installation.  Also, any contact I had with the office was very professionally handled. I would highly recommend John Owens Services.    Don  R. Engler.</review>

The bid came in right in the middle of other bids -significantly lower than the most expensive and my confidence in them was significantly higher than the least expensive company.  The installation crew, Ivan and Gabe were on time every day,  communicative, neat, pleasant, knowledgeable and professional.  The job was done in 3 days as estimated with no additional or hidden costs.  I have worked in contracting and do a lot of work around my house - their workmanship was very good.  The job was permitted and HERS tested as required.  I highly recommend John Owens for this type of work and would certainly consider them for other work they do.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>John Owens has completed two yard irrigation jobs for me . First job was leak detection and replacement of main water line from street to the house. They sent out a technician immediately after I called them. The technician was a real pro and in a matter of minutes found the source of the leaks in my main water line. Over the following 48 hours they retrenched and then installed a new main line. Fast, highly professional and fair prices. They deserve the highest recommendation for all aspects of plumbing services.<//Review>< userid>

<Text>My boiler went out on a Friday afternoon. John Owens had a tech there at 8 AM on Saturday. Not only did he analyze a complex problem correctly, fix my problem, and get me a hot shower by 10 AM, the price was very reasonable and Tim, the seasoned veteran, was a fine gentleman. I was totally impressed.<//Text>< pics>

<text>Tim from John Owens Services did a great job.  While here on a routine cleaning and inspection, he found and fixed faulty wiring that was missed when another company came to service the waterless water tank two years ago.  He was polite and efficient.  I particularly like that an ETA and Tim's photo were texted to me so I'd know whom to expect and when.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<text>We needed to replace an aged air conditioner. John provided timely advice on service last year and more recently when we wanted to replace our unit and coils. We received honest and accurate information, a fair price for the new unit, and excellent installation and clean up afterwards. I strongly recommend John Owens Services without any reservation.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808599efffffffff:0xd0ef64c3cb47456d< /gmap_id></record>

I was referred to John Owens by one of my neighbors.  It became apparent from the time they walked into our house that they were well prepared to remove our old tankless system and replace it with a Rinnai system. The technicians were skillful, extremely efficient and worked in a well-coordinated fashion to stand up the new system.  I would hire them again in a heartbeat - consummate professionals who represent my definition of excellent contractors for plumbing-related matters.  The population of contractors would be well-served with more folks like John Owens Services - BRAVO!!!<//text>

Perhaps less expensive workers can be found, but not once did I feel that John's pricing was above the high quality work performed.  Quality counts.<//text>< rating>

We had a broken water heater, and the technician, Kemo, came out promptly and diagnosed the problem and discussed possible solutions with us. He was very professional and helpful and returned within a few days and replaced the tank and corrected the wiring. He did carpentry, plumbing and electrical work. We were very pleased with the service.< /Text>

Was having difficulty with the heating situation for months.   John sent out Temo Keilt.   Temo, my heating super hero, was able to diagnose a multitude of problems related to the furnace and resolved many of the issues with competence, additionally providing recommendations that can  improve the distribution of heat in the house and lower my heating bills.  He was patient, pleasant and obviously an expert in his field.</text>

I first met John at my previous home. He worked for the previous owner, so I called him when I needed my furnace repaired. He and his team were great. When we moved to Marin and planned to remodel our new home, I didn't hesitate to call John. He is doing all the plumbing and HVAC. He and his team take the stress out of a remodel. I know the work performed is the best. His guys are professional and highly skilled.< /review>

<Review>John has always given me the most professional service but last year went over and above what one might expect from a service professional. My boiler failed after only a few years of service. John contacted the manufacturer and the supplier, both of whom put obstacles in the way of getting the rebate that a customer should expect in such a situation. They  stonewalled, weaved and jived and generally tried to duck their responsibilities in ways that could be guaranteed to exhaust the patience and persistence of ordinary people. John however was annoyed at all this and kept at it - in his own time and long since I had forgotten all about it. Eventually one day, out of the blue, I got a check in the mail for several thousand dollars. Thank you John. That is integrity!<//Review>< Pics>

Temo looked over the boiler carefully and noticed the leaks were coming from a valve connected to a pipe near the boiler, not the boiler itself. Temo replaced the valve and thoroughly tested the system - all was good and I basically saved $8000!< /Text><username>Stuart<//username><response>None<//response><time>1545177897774< /time><GmapID>0x808599efffffffff:0xd0ef64c3cb47456d<//GmapID><Rating>5< /Rating>< userid>

I have used John Owens for two distinctly different issues in my home. One for a radiant floor leak and the other for a major drainage issue with my home. Both times, Tim came to my house and did exemplary work. Tim was friendly, courteous, very knowledgeable and very transparent. No unnecessary upsells or egregious service charges. He is so very knowledgeable about Eichlers (and homes in general) that I learned a great deal from him as he repaired the problems. Tim ensured that John Owens will be my first call for any issues I have in the future. I recommend them fully.<//review>

<text>John and his team installed a complete radiant heat and hot water boiler for my new construction project. The system is great!. He was very knowledgeable and helped design a system that worked for my house and the needs of my family. He provided options to save money and energy.

John and his team are very professional. I received a text message letting me know every time John and his team would arive.  John was very flexible and always willing to find solutions to problems. He never complained about the work that other contractors did that made his work more complicated.

John, was by far the best experience of my entire new construction project.

I would recommend John and his team for any plumbing, heating or HVAC project</text>< Pictures>

There were also updates on his expected arrival time.   He was able to service my system as well as efficiently diagnose a couple  of problems with faulty parts that, with a comprehensive  on-truck parts inventory, he was able to readily able to replace thereby avoiding a return visit.   This was my first experience with John Owens Services after using another service for the past 6 years.   In addition to the all around attention to detail, their parts and service  are also competitively priced.  I live outside their typical range of service so am only hoping I can coax them back out next time I call!<//Text>< date>

<Text>John and his crew were top notch. We had an rather complicated emergency situation during the "big storm", and John managed to fit us into his schedule; so we could resolve all of our issues promptly. He noticed and even repaired a broken pipe/drain the same day with only minutes to spare before the next storm hit. John and his crew always arrived as scheduled, made excellent cost saving suggestions, and were down right a pleasure with which to work. His pricing is very fair, and his product is GREAT! We had certain things in mind, and John actually explained to us why they weren't the right fit for our house/situation (saving us a lot of money). Highly recommend John Owens and his crew!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I originally called John Owens Services to make an appointment to have our home heating vents cleaned after we had a bedroom fire. After speaking with John, I realized that we needed to have the vents replaced, instead, as it is often impossible for heating vents to be properly cleaned after a fire.

Our experience from start to finish was outstanding. The young technician, Randy, who assessed the damage and provided a price quote was also the one responsible, along with a partner, for installing the new vents.

This is a top notch family-run business that takes pride in providing excellent customer service. They returned our calls promptly, showed up on time, worked quickly and efficiently and did a thorough job cleaning up afterwards. In short, they are true professionals. Thank you, John Owens & Company for your excellent work!</Text>

I went 1 hour ago for a free birthday scoop only for the employee to let me know it doesn't work with their Tuesday $1.99 scoop special. I don't understand what my coupon has to do with their special but I'll never be back thanks!< /text>

<Text>DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS LOCATION!  I pre ordered and paid in full, for 3 birthday bakes for a large party.  I received my email confirmation of the order and pickup time, and an alert once my credit card was charged. When I arrived the day of the party to pick them up, and they were NOT made AND they would NOT issue a refund!  I left all of my contact information (which they already had on the order), and have gotten NO response.  I am disputing the charge but save yourself the trouble and pain, and do not give this store your business.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Free waffle cone check-in with a purchase of a double scoop!!! One of my local go to places for ice cream and I totally dig the 31 flavors! The service is on point here too with plenty of samples given before you decide to make your selection on one or two or even three flavors (which I've never done - a triple scoop).< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Cleveland & Metz is the best workers comp law firm in the IE.  This is the second time I have had a work-related injury and have received representation from this law firm. Silvia, the paralegal without hesitation opened my case.  She was always available to listen to my concerns and provided the assistance needed. She made the necessary referrals to ensure my needs were address. Without attorney representation in a work-related injury, one would not receive the necessary medical attention. The employer’s insurance is always denying medical treatment. I am beyond satisfied and grateful with the services provided by this law firm.< /Review>

Ii decided to open this yelp account to review attorney Metz.  My story is really complicated but i want to tell you what a great lawyer he is.  My company fired me and then said my injury didnt happen.  We went to court 3 times and he got all the records from my doctors and then even though i was sooooooo scared we went to trial.  He spent all this time with me getting me ready for the trial and he is sooooo confident he made me feel confident.  I felt like he knew all the answers and the attorney for the other side really seemed kinda afraid.  The company attorney had a coworker testify and it was like on TV where attorney Metz should him documents and the coworker had no answer.  The coworker tried to say I didnt have certain duties at my job and attorney Metz showed him in the papers he got that my coworker was wrong.  I really respect how hard attorney Metz worked for me.  We won the case!!!!! Now im going to get treatment and a settlement.  I HIGHLY recommend attorney Metz< /text>

If you need a workers comp lawyer this is the only place to go. Absolutely awesome.

They are always there to help, answer all questions and are always wonderful at addressing your concerns. They are the best at what they do hands down IMO. Even after your case is settled to make sure you get everything your supposed to get. All law offices could learn from this firm.</Review><user_id>103566579244171279716</user_id>< Date>

We spend an extraordinary amount of time following up on client inquiries be it by email, telephone calls, or in person appointments. The majority of our work is from word-of-mouth as we do not advertise and we have a 25 year reputation of representing injured workers.. Second, we don't have a client by this name so your claim that you have been with us for a couple of years is very unlikely. If you're going to write a bad review about a business, at least have the honesty and decency to use your real name.\n\nCharles R.

Definitely do not recommend this place to anyone. They never follow up on anything. Try to get in contact with my attorney or his paralegal and they are never available. Always get told they will give me a call back and they never do. I’ve actually scheduled appointments with the lawyer and he ends up not being available at the time of my appointment, he ends up calling an hour or two later. Sorry I don’t have time to wait around for whenever they please. I consider them all very unprofessional, been with them for a couple of years and All they ever say is they’re working on it, but nothing gets done.<//Text>

This law firm is top notch. Whenever I had a question or concern, Mr. Cleveland would get back to me at first chance.

From dealing with the Work Comp courts in Pomona to finding the right specialist. I would highly recommend the Law Offices of Cleveland & Metz to handle your work comp case(s)!<//Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Overall, WHAT A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!! Never can get a hold of the lawyer. Instead I had to talk to clerical with BAD ATTITUDES! What was suppose to be a simple case somehow went terribly wrong. “In my opinion mistakes were made.” The final court papers were reviewed quickly by office staff with me, not a lawyer, who were in a hurry to leave for the day. They missed something that was important but I just don’t want to have anymore contact with them. I know, most people don’t like lawyers, but ..............What a terrible experience........ STAY AWAY!!!!! Post comment:
Before the pandemic. I had 2-3 different lawyers represent me in court and other legal proceedings. I was tossed around like a salad.<//Text>< pictures>

<Resp>{'time': 1613673552132, 'text': "I read your comment, it is blatantly false and misleading. Because the pandemic we have no in person meetings in our office for documents, contactless document methods are used and have been for the past year. There are two attorneys here only, John Metz and Charles Cleveland and we review all final settlement and other final the court documents. Our staff is very patient with our clients and both of the attorneys here are readily available for telephone appointments, email, and electronic document review. We are not open to the public because of the pandemic but all the court documents are prepared electronically. Because you've disguised your name it's difficult to determine who you are or what your problem was last March. Anyone reading this can be assured that we are a small firm that spends a lot of attention on our clients and all court and settlement documents are vetted by myself or my partner John Metz.\nCharles R.

<review>Ashley Chaparro is amazing! She was very responsive and extremely helpful in my case. She was able to get my sister and I seen by a chiropractor the day after our accident and gave me great advice on what to do next. She was patient and thorough when answering all my questions (and believe me there were a lot of questions since this was my first big accident). Thank you Ashley for helping take some stress off my shoulders!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Forgive me ahead of time as this email is long overdue. On behalf of my patents, they would like to thank Ashley and the attorney for helping them. My mom was satisfied with the communication and constant updates on both cases.

They highly recommend them for your car accident as they feel they were taken care of.

Thank you Ashley for making my parents feel very comfortable and being attentive to their needs and health during Covid19.

Ashley Chaparro and John Metz gave me great advice in my initial consultation. Ashley took the time to walk me through the terms of the contract and made me feel comfortable and confident in their legal team. They worked on my case for over a year and maintained consistent communication with any questions or updates that arose throughout the process. John and Ashley were extremely professional and clear and helped me win my settlement from a painful car crash! Thank you to the wonderful legal team at the Law Offices of Cleveland and Metz!</text>

<Review>I was referred to Cleveland and Metz by a friend and I must say it has been the best experience I've ever had. I've never dealt with attorney's or workers comp and they were just amazing at explaining everything throughout the whole process, Charles would speak to me directly. I was always kept updated and when I would call in  the staff were always respectful and helpful I am very thankful for them. I would highly recommend  them!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

This firm went to bat for me and my husband when we were involved in a car accident through no fault of our own. The insurance company was very difficult to work with and didn't want to give us anything.  But, Ashley was able to negotiate a settlement so that we could receive some compensation for our injuries. We appreciate the level of dedication that Cleveland & Metz provides their clients. They truly put their clients interests above their own!</text>

Best law firm and best people to work with. Got quick responses and information even during a quarantine. I knew John was working for me and my family the minute we spoke over the phone. Was able to settle our case and get what we needed in a time like this. Cannot recommend anyone more than this. ++< /Review>

I have been to other law offices that say and even act like they want to help; but they they would drop me like a hot potato and never respond to my inquiries. Charles Cleveland at Cleveland and Metz law firm was always on the ball and answered my questions in a timely manner. I was able to hire him and quite literally close/ settle my case in 3 months; even when my employers insurance company would not take my calls. Both Mr. Cleveland and his secretary Jackie were [I believe] instrumental in winning my case. If you choose Mr. Cleveland at Cleveland and Metz, you will have chosen wisely.< /Review>

I did not feel the need to look elsewhere when I first met with Mr. Cleveland. He was to the point and professional. The best part was how quickly Mr. Cleveland responded to my emails. When you are experiencing physical pain and stress is piling, it is a relief to have your attorney respond quickly and with professionalism. Thank you for everything.<//Review>

I was in a car accident and spoke to John Metz and he was able to find me a doctor to see me the next day.  I did not have really bad injuries, but I was super sore and that treatment was very helpful.  As soon as I was done with the doctors he got me a settlement and paid off my doctors.  He got me more than I thought.  I would definitely higher him again.< /Text>

<Review>Attorney John Metz is much more than a 5 Star rating! Mr. Metz, Sylvia,  and his team represented my case professionally, aggressively and treated me with dignity and respect during a very difficult time. Throughout the process all my questions were answered and the continued communication was outstanding! I highly recommend John Metz and this law firm... my case was a success because of his diligence!</Review><Name>N Vasquez</Name></record></dataset><record>

I was very glad i made the decisions to go with this  office. MONICA RAZO was the best!! Very Respectful, friendly and professional. She takes the time to explain everything to you. Makes it super easy to understand everything. Overall everyone in the office were very respectful and welcoming. Thank you.< /Review>

The insurance company sent me to a terrible doctor after I got hurt at work.  My employer shut down and I had no where to turn.  I hired Attorney Metz and he sent me to a chiropractor who was also great and we settled my case out of court.  I give him 5 stars for sure.< /text>

Attorney Metz is a GREAT trial lawyer.  We went in front of a judge in Pomona and he grilled the guy the employer brought in to court and we won.  Now I have medical for life and I am getting money every week.</text>

Let me start by saying that I was hurt doing what I love best, trucking and John Metz was a tough as nails lawyer who did not put up with insurance incompetence.  He went to court for me 3 times and did an emergency court case and got my money going.  He has all this sports stuff in his office which should tell you how he loves to compete and fight for you.  John Metz is the best.</review>

I am current client of John K Metz, I have called many times and I never hear back from Monica. When I am able to talk with Monica she states she will call me back but never does! Monica did this 10-15 times to me! I still haven't heard back my answers. I asked to speak with John and the lady answering the calls and Monica says ‘NO” he is at court and that’s what we are here for. My advice is stay away from this law office. They will take your calls and when they accept your case they ignore you! I have to write this review anonymous because I don’t want them to know who I am that will affect my outcome of the case. Monica will not keep you in touch about your case! Anyone is better than her!
Oh every time I ask to make an appt with John Monica says "NO" I will handle it I don't need to see him for this issue! BUT the issue is never resolve.< /text>

Unfortunately lawyers spend a lot of time in court and can't be available when you call randomly. John and I are always available to book in advance for telephone or face-to-face appointments if you request one. These requests are always accommodated which makes your post not credible. If you really are a client, I recommend you do this as soon as possible so we can address your complaints and resolve this problem. I meet with clients or handle my phone appointments almost every day around my court schedule.\nMore than likely you are a competitor using a shell account you opened an hour ago or have some personal beef with Monica since what you are describing simply doesn't happen here. - Charles Cleveland"}< /resp>< UserId.>

I would highly recommend Cleveland and Metz.  Mr. Cleveland took my case when no else would.  He was very patient through the very long process and answered all of my questions immediately when I emailed him.  The office staff is very friendly and professional.  You definitely won't be disappointed with the service you receive from this office.

Thank you again Mr. Cleveland for all that you did.< /Review>

Being injured on the job is devastating; on top of the pain, all that runs the ones in mind is how am I going to pay the bills and how will I feed my family.

Choosing The Law Offices of Cleveland & Metz was by far the best decision I’ve made in 2019.

My attorney, Mr. Charles Cleveland and his wonderful staff (Ms. Nuemy) were beside me every step of the way. He settled my case carefully and expeditiously with my interest at heart.

I can honestly say, even with my disability, I came out a winner!

Thank You Cleveland & Metz, May God Continue To Bless You All.</review>

<review>Mr. Cleveland worked hard on my case and was truthful about everything, which I truly appreciated. My case was a workmans comp case, however,  California is not a workers comp friendly state, so it was a real battle. All in all he did what he could and he was honest and compassionate about my case. Thank you for all you did.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
In the face of legal problems due to injuries I suffered at work, I consider myself extremely lucky to have found Mr. Charles Cleveland to represent me in a case that I was told it was hopeless.
I found his knowledge of every single detail of the law and his caring for my case so impressive. He won my case when I had been told I had no chance by other attorneys.
Also everyone in his office was very professional, courteous and caring. Both Mr. Cleveland and his staff always responded back to my every inquiry either the same day or within a couple of hours which I believe is not common when it comes to law firms.
As you can see I can't say enough good things about Mr. Cleveland and his office and I recommend him to anyone I care about in a heartbeat.</Review>

It’s been 3 months since I went with this fly by night outfit. They haven’t assigned me a doctor, haven’t called me I’ve left 5 messages for them to call me back over the last month with no call backs. I am going to look for another WC lawyer very depressing and very anxious cause they won’t even let me know what’s going on. Do yourself or family member a favor and bypass all the heart ache and find a more reputable reliable law firm.<//text>

<review>I was lucky to find out about Charles Cleveland. He’s a great workman’s compensation attorney and he always answers any and all questions you may have via email in a very timely manner. I was hurt at my old job and their insurance company (Sedgwick) offered a low settlement in my book. Mr. Cleveland got me three times what they offered. Overall I am very happy with Cleveland/Metz law and I highly recommend them to anyone that needs a real lawyer that will fight for you.< /review><GmapID>0x80c3368b6b7dd4e9:0x19f45e181de2c060<//GmapID>< Date>

< review>
My mother would like me to advise you how appreciative she is of the quick services. Her auto accident was February 2017, and she picked up her check in the beginning of August already. She had a previous attorney in LA who she was never available and the paralegals were always rude when she would ask for questions. She has very spoken highly of the paralegal who handled her auto accident case from beginning to end. My mother was not only content that she spoke Spanish, but thankful that she was nice, polite, and always returned my mothers calls back. The Doctor she went to was also great, my mother feels much better and couldn't thank the paralegal enough for getting her in so fast.

On behalf of my mother thank you and I, Thank you for having a great paralegal who assisted her every step of the way!<//review>

I got in an accident, and i got recommended by one of my close friends that was in a law firm for workers comp. He advised me to go with Cleveland and Metz because they work fast. I was helped by the paralegal named Ashley that was consistently keeping me informed about my case. I got my settlement check a lot faster than other firms because of how much persistent she was with the  other insurance company on getting everything completed.<//Text>

Charles Cleveland was highly recommended to me by an attorney that handles LA County worker comp cases. Having to make a WC claim due to an injury and dealing with all that goes with it is no picnic
.
I am very fortunate that I found exceptional representation in Charles Cleveland.

He was not always available to talk on the phone when I had a question. BUT..He was ALWAYS available by e-mail and would answer my question quickly.

If he couldn't answer he let me know that he would check on it. I never felt like my questions got lost in hyper-space. He always answered  even if it was just a "got it"
I couldn't always talk to him but if I needed a verbal answer I could talk to one of his staff.

He took care of issues in a timely manner and I never felt like I was "Just a File"
He stuck with me through thick and thin. And believe me my case had it's ups and downs.
My case closed yesterday after 51/2 years. He didn't rush me, he fought for me and didn't settle till it was right. I got a fair settlement.

I would highly recommend Charles Cleveland to anyone.

He is an advocate for the worker, keeps up on the ever changing Worker Comp. laws and keeps his clients updated also.< /Text>

While my spouse's case was eventually handled, closed and in fairness, Mrs. Velasquez was a nice lady who was helpful for the most part, there were still lingering after effects which hurt us both because certain things were not resolved correctly. We did reach out to ask about this, and nothing was resolved. Never once did the attorney reach out until at the end of the case. I've read many reviews on here of other people having a bad experiences, some are anonymous, in which they are accused of being a competitor or told to go else where. I think we should of done just that. We should of went to someone else who would of respected us and value us as clients. I should of seen the red flags and read all of the reviews, especially the negative one and how they were responded back too.< /Review>< pics>

Cleveland is a great guy. Honest and trustworthy. Got hurt at the warehouse I worked. Found him online send him an email and he responded right away. Took me time to decide I needed an lawyer. Didn't want to be "that guy". But I couldn't keep up with all the paperwork I got. He talked to me and kept me informed. He did a good job on my case.<//Review>

<Review>When my coworker dropped a box on my foot at work and sprained it I was so sure my job was gonna take care of me. Boy was I wrong they treated me like crap. They thought I was a liar. My supervisor would make fun of me in front of my coworkers saying I was a wimp and to just get over it. I had an old case with Mr. Cleveland years ago and I called him again. He sent me to a doctor that the insurance had on their list. I had some therapy and started to feel better. After 6 months I was back to work. My case was not worth a lot of money but that's not what I was looking for. I got better and kept my job. Cleveland will always be my go to lawyer.< /Review><userid>117018922915013479842<//userid>< resp>

On behalf of my mother Rosa, she would like to say thank you!!!!!!!

She is very happy and satisified, she is very happy of the paralegal Ashley who assisted her case with the attorney John. This is my second car accident with them and my mom can't describe how happy she is. They didn't want to accept responsibility in the beginning but they made it happen, this office is like family. We will all continue to come here.

After contacting several lawyers regarding my case I found Charles Cleveland. I could not be happier. He and his entire staff are very knowledgeable and professional. He is very prompt in replying to inquiries especially via e mail which is my preferred method so I can ask questions without forgetting anything.
Charles Cleveland settled my case in a way I could not have imagined was possible. I highly recommend him.<//text>

<Text>I had a work injury in June 2013. It was denied and I researched attorneys.  Mr. Cleveland had the highest reviews and I took a chance.  Wow, was I sure glad I did.  One year and 2 months after the injury my case was resolved and my award was much greater than I expected.  Mr. Cleveland is a very humble and intelligent individual who I highly recommend.  When I had questions, I would email him and within 24 hours I always received a personal email from him responding to my questions. His office is very good about sending messages and notifiying you if they are in need of any documents from you. He is definitely the best you can get in Southern California. Mr. Cleveland, thank you for great work. You are the BEST<//Text><username>judy moore< /username><user>117716774470930406870<//user>< time>

< Review>
I was referred to this office by my cousin, Jessica.  She mentioned great things about Ashley and how she had handled her car accident case after it had been dropped by her former attorney because her case was not worth pursuing.  When I spoke with Ashley a few weeks ago regarding my car accident, she was very friendly, helpful, and professional.  Unfortunately, Ashley was not able to take on my case, since over a year had passed since the incident.  Nonetheless, I would like to thank her for taking the time to talk with me when other lawyers I contacted did not give me their time.</Review>

They got me a very nice settlement. I had gone to another attorney I saw on TV, who I later found out was located in Long Beach, who kept passing my case to other people. After being jerked around for 6 months with no results, I went to Mr. Cleveland who personally took charge and took my case to court. I highly recommend this attorney, he's honest and very knowledgable. He personally answered all my questions.</text>

Cleveland Mets were my workers compensation attorneys. These guys were great. I met with them personally and they answered all my questions. My case finally settled after a year and a half in court and finally  I got my last settlement check . I was very happy with my result after everything I've been through.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I know, nobody likes attorneys, right? Well, I saw Charles Cleveland and he was prompt, gave me his attention, explained my options very clearly (in perfect plain English), and after working for me for 3 months, didn't even charge me.
My job sent me to an industrial clinic for a hernia. After a few visits, they set me up with what I call a 'handyman' surgeon. I was very nervous about his skills, and couldn't find any info on him. I asked my workmans comp rep for a second opinion but got the runaround.
So, I signed up Charles, and he got me set up with a specialist. He had to use some tough language with the WC rep, but that was okay with me if it got results. During the whole time, I was able to communicate with them pretty well too, especially using email and/or text.
I got the hernia repair surgery done (and that sucked because it's very painful), took the time off work necessary, and now I'm back to (almost) my old self after 3 months.
Since there was no permanent injury disability, and that meant there was no payout, Charles Cleveland said it was no charge. That's cool.
Anyway, I recommend them because they're aggressive, communicate well, and seem to be good people.

I posted this same review on Yelp and Yellow Pages even though those sites made me set up an account first. I didn't want to do that but I did want to leave him a good review. Hope you have the same level of satisfaction from them as I did.<//Text>< pictures>

I still had pain so I hired Mr. Cleveland to handle my case. Mr. Cleveland sent me to Dr. Wood who listened to me and he arranged my treament including a surgery on my left wrist.

<review>I am not much of a reviewer, but i am very satisfied with the effort, work ethic and constant communication given to my daughter's cases.

I was skeptical about getting an attorney and wanted to do it alone, but my parents advised me it was best to hire an attorney for the auto accident they were passengers in. I am glad i did!!!! Ashley is the paralegal that assists the attorney for the auto cases in the office, and i had my doubts as my parents said this is a big Workers Compensation office, but she sure new her sfuff. She was kind and full of knowledge about the auto accidents do's and dont's. Not once did she hesitate a response and helped with all of my queations, doubts and concerns.

I would like to say thank you! I am impressed with the hard work. She went from a zero $ offer to a descent amount, now this is satisfying!!

All around, i was happy with the diligent work and effort the assistant provided to my girls case.

Thank you for your attentive help!<//review>< Pics>

I seriosuly called like 6 offices yesterday evening and this is the inly one that called me back with useful information. I came across this office because of the great auto accident reviews. My car was damaged bad in a bad accident 3 weeks ago, but the guy had no insurance and i have no injuries i just needed assistance in how to go about getting my car paid and i can honealt say even though the legal assistant told me she could not take my case :( she was such a sweetheart! She seriously directed me how to move forward. I may not have been anle to be a client but i totally felt taken care of. These reviews are legit and the cool part you see the attorney will reapond on behalf of the office. Thanks again to the auto accident helper in your office Cleveland and Mets, she brought ease to my anxiety and having no help anywhere< /Text>

<UserId.>109292542911018736975</UserId.><text>So, im actually big on reviewing seafood and dancing, but I havent done either in a few days, so Im gonna post about THE BEST ATTORNEY EVER.. Attorney John Metz is the MAN... My fine looking attorney was recommended to me by a friend out in the IE but she told me he was soooo good that I should hire him even though I live in LA.  His staff found me a doctor near my home in the LA area and I talked to attorney metz on the phone a few times and then met him in court.. Those pictures dont lie... too funny I have a crush on my attorney but he was very patient with me and talked to me about all the doctors in my case and how much my case was worth.  I got more money than I than I thought I would.  If I could give him 6 stars, I would.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Charles and his team are our own personal superheroes (with Charles leading as our Superman!!!) I can not stress enough to anyone that is ever involved in a work comp claim to give them a shot. No matter how big or small, they will take care of you.
After researching several different attorneys, I came across Charles Cleveland and John Metz. Both of them were highly rated on yelp and very helpful when I spoke with Charles on the phone. He was knowledgable, caring, and never once pressured me into choosing his firm. Even some of the other lawyers we consulted with would ask me who my top choices were and when I mentioned Cleveland & Metz they all agreed that they were an amazing group of attorneys and would be a great choice. Charles was more than generous and willing to help me out in my workers comp claim.
Shortly after our steller experiance with the workcomp claim we were involved in a major car accident. After the accident, I was running around dealing with insurance, doctors, appointments, surgery and spending time with my family all while still trying to keep up my schedule at the office. When I finally asked John Metz to be our attorney, he swooped in and helped alleviate some of the stress that had been building inside of us. John was able to put my mind at ease and would do what needed to be done on the legal side and to not only focus on my recovery but also focus on myself.
John did more then just the legal side. He actually cared for my wife and I beyond clients. He helped us emotionally and told us how everything would go and not to worry about anything. Charles John and their team are amazing, and in a terrible situation they allowed us to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</text>< Rating>

I was working in a warehouse pulling orders when a coworker left some boxes on the floor.  I didn't see them and i tripped and fell causing me to fall in an awkward way hurting my back.  I went to the company doctor who said i was just overweight and to go back to work.  I was so upset and frustrated that i just kept working in pain.  Until one day the pain was so bad i couldnt get out of bed.  A coworker recommended Jackie Velasquez who had help her husband on a previous case.   So i made an appointment with Jackie.  She got me in to see a doctor right away.  The insurance wasnt happy i wanted to go see someone else but Jackie explained to me it was my right.  So the new doctor sent me to get an MRI where it showed i did have a hernited disc in my back.  I started to get treatment and had some relief.  I'm still under treatment but i feel alot better knowing my rights.<//text>

Because of how difficult my case is, he wrote me everything he can do and someone who works with difficult car accidents like el.mio told me.

(Translated by Google) I suffer from medical problems that have nothing to do with my work. But I was injured at work and my work injury made these problems worse. John Metz took my case and found great doctors who understand all my health problems.

(Translated by Google) Although my case was quite difficult, my experience with the Cleveland & Metz attorneys' offices was very pleasurable. My Lawyer Mr. Cleveland was always very interested in solving my case in the best possible way. And his assistant Nuemy was always very lovable and willing to answer all my questions. I highly recommend the offices of Cleveland & Metz helped me solve my case and I am very happy with the results.

I've tried every sandwich (except sardines) and it's very consistent.  I wished they used better meat and much better bread but they are watching their costs.  For $3 or $4 I understand.  They seem to be the only place in town for a Vietnamese sandwich?

They do have a fairly high minimum for using debit cards.< /review><UserId.>110042262159911049207<//UserId.>< name>

<Text>So as of today i no longer can say i really enjoy this restaurant which saddens me. The original people who ran this business no longer work there, they are gone. So the place may look nicer inside but, it isn't fast anymore. Like it takes forever for you to get a simple iced tea. As for the food it doesn't have the same taste and the bread isn't as light, fluffy, or crunchy (like when u bite into the bread). Instead it is soggy and saturated with some new dark sauce. In my opinion this ruins the whole sandwich, even when the meat and veggies taste good. So i may go there one more time to see if they've been able to get back on track but, if not then this place with meet it's evident death.<//Text>< Pictures>

If I could give zero stars I would... this place is nothing compared to what "LIDO" used to be. Second time I've come here and they ran out of bread... "lido" was way better. New owners/managers suck.< /Text>

< Review>
So, to be fair, this is one of those instances where you don't do better until you know better (or in this case-tasted better). I thought the price was outstanding for the sandwich I received. However, I found that every time I would order the bread was so hard it would scrape the top of my mouth. Very uncomfortable, but I thought, " Hey, maybe this is how banh mi sandwiches are supposed to be". Then each time I went I would ask for extra jalapeño. They would say okay sure, but I noticed a hesitation. When I got home there would be no extra and what's worse, I don't think they were using fresh ingredients because the "jalapeños" were sweet not spicy. I even had to confirm that they were jalapeños. Anyway, the sandwiches got soggier on the inside and harder on the outside. I finally tried Mai Banh Mi in Oakland. OH MY GOD. There's a sandwich! I only eat the vegetarian but the tofu was so much more flavorful, the bread was crisp and soft at the same time. The jalapeños were fresh, even the cabbage tasted better. That's that on that. Peace out Loving Tea, stay blessed.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I booked an appointment online and confirmed it by emailing them. They confirmed it back in writing. When I showed up with my daughter on her birthday to get her ears pierced, no one was there to do the piercing. They said you had to call to confirm the appointment and I said I did call to book it originally but no one answered and so I booked online and someone emailed to confirm my appointment. They said it says it on the website to call but you would think that when a human manually emails you back and confirms your appointment that would be good enough. Not sure what else a customer can do to confirm an appointment. Poor service. Lame.</text>< Pictures>

I would highly recommend Mariam! My son refused and fought us for two years when it came to getting a haircut. The first time we convinced him to get one was with Mariam. She is so patient and really takes her time to make the cut nice. I have to mention my son is scared of the buzzer so she cuts his hair with scissors which I'm sure is soo annoying but she's still manages to make it look good. I'm so happy I found her!<//Text>

<Text>Wonderful experience!!

I have found the best kids salon in Westwood. The staff is so warm, and so much fun to talk to. They’re very down to earth, and make you feel like family. It is such a fun environment, you can tell how much they care about not just the clients, but each other as well.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

We went to Lil'locks today and we had a great experience.  we got our body temperature checked, Anna was wearing mask, gloves, and face cover. She was following all the safety protocols, her place was clean, and taking one family at a time. Making appointments with Lil’locks was so easy on her website and we are definitely taking our kids back in few weeks.< /text>

SUPPORT LOCAL! This shop is not only designed to help kids over come their fears and have an amazing fun experience, but also is created by the most dedicated, thoughtful and experienced staff.

This place is great. My toddler hates getting his hair cut! This is the only place that he tolerates. With cartoons, ride in cars, lollipops and really quick service, I love it. Also, it's affordable. I was originally taking my son to my salon, but man, that adds up!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1549522712767, 'text': 'Hi Chloe, thank you for your review.

Professional and quick service. I love that she has a tablet with games on it to keep the kids from squirming around and sit still. 5 stars.   Check it out!< /Review>

< Review>
Today we came back after many months of trying a different place due to a more convenient commute.  All I can say is that I regret it so badly...

The lady who cut my daughters hair completely messed her up. She did not even apply water to the hair, she cut her hair dry!!!! The idea was to remove some weight and she just left my daughter with and uneven cut. Now her hair is looking like a cheap dolls hair.

The lady was on the phone at the time she finished the cut. She even dared to asked for a tip after her rudeness and unprofessional service.

Believe there is no reason for you to go to this place. You can get a better service anywhere else.

Will post a photo soon.<//Review>

<username>Ash Birla</username><time>1535327846756< /time><review>This was a really bad experience (2nd time in a row). Because the mall is closing down the hair dressers are quite rude (that to towards a 2 year old!). Also, they changed price to $25 for a boy/kids hair cut but they still write $18 in the front door. Very unprofessional. Earlier there used to be movie/tv playing but they do not have that anymore. We did not post negative review last time because we wanted to give it another shot. This time it was worse. The only reason why this place survives is because they are open on Sundays till late around 6 pm.< /review>< Resp>

If I could give this place a zero star I would. The stylist was very rude and unprofessional. I went in to get my child’s first haircut. They ignored my request and acted like they didn’t want to service me so I quickly left and decide to go to the yellow balloon where they give great service and it is a well liked place by my kid!!! I will never go to lil locks again!!!!< /Review>

<Text>Went here for our 14 month old sons haircut. While they were careful not to hurt him and he was squirmy and uncomfortable, the stylist really botched his haircut. Looks horrible. I understand the difficulty cutting a squirmy unhappy young child, however they have not honed their craft appropriately. They even acknowledged the haircut was bad by offering for him to come back when he was less fussy to redo the cut right before we left. Unfortunately with our schedule, we were unable to come back.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Went to drive- thru last night, cashier didn’t even give me my change then didn’t even apologize for that. I drove off they didn’t complete the order cause they were missing an item. Went back to get it & no acknowledgement of their mistake, no apology again. Poor customer service especially from the manager who was working she didn’t say anything. She looked full from eating all the food there.< /text></record>

Eh, it's hard to find good fried chicken in California. The chicken was cooked properly. It was okay. But, it was over-breaded and under-seasoned. Still a good value for the money.</review>

< Review>
This is the closest Churchs Chicken since I've moved to the area, and I'm happy to say my experience when coming here is pretty good. The order takers are always nice and the food is always good. Personally, I prefer Church's chicken to KFC. The wait in the drive-thru can be long some days, but worth it.</Review>

Worst service ever, after a long 12 hr shift I stopped here to get something to eat for myself and my 2 boys, after repeating my order 3 time at the speaker and once again when I got to the window they still managed to get my order 100% wrong also I only got 2 bbq packs when I asked for a few more cause I had ordered "3 boxes of 5 chicken  tenders " she threw 2 more in my bag oh and by the way I didn't get no chicken tenders at all. I don't understand how hard it is to take a simple order< /text>

This is the worst Church’s chicken ever. I have eaten church’s chicken in a few different areas and states. This is by far the worst. From the customer service to the chicken. Chicken very greasy like they hadn’t changed the grease in a while. This made the chicken wet and dripping with grease when eating it. Who wants to be eating soggy dripping greasy old tasting chicken. Got attitude with me for bringing it back. Moreno Valley Ca. Alessandro Blvd. eewwh.</review>

<Review>Stood 20min in drive thru to be told that my order was going to take another 35min and if i can around (weird cause it was only a spicy 20 piece) after 45min i had to wave down an employee because you can't go inside only for the guy to grab it right off the counter were it was sitting for who knows how long. overall always have to wait at this place for basic meals and hit or miss on the staff</Review>< Pictures>

Just left the Moreno Valley location on Alessandro for what turned out to be yet again poor customer service. A drive-thru full of ppl and they advise that they are only making orders as they come!! So my 12pc order will be a 3min wait. You are a fast food chicken spot and there is literally a drive-thru wrapped around with close to a hr and a half til closing!! SMH I definitely will not be returning and will be certain to advise others I know to do the same🤦🏾‍♀️<//review>

<review>I have gone to this Church's Chicken numerous times, its a hit and miss with them and always because they forgot something in the order. Today it was a chicken sandwich and fries, it was a combo, I got my drink. So I went back with the food(I was not given a receipt) I stood in line 4 people ahead of me. The man kept telling me I need a receipt, which I was not given, my order was $49.00. And after waiting in line for 20 minutes and 10 minutes disputing with the employee I got the sandwich and fries with a parting reply "we always give the customer their receipt". One star 🌟 is too much, but I could not continue without rating.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

< review>
I have been going to Church's Chicken for a very long time and I know they are very busy during the day but today was something so shameful that I might now go back I was in line for 30mins to get to the speaker just waiting for them to take my order and waited for 5 to 7 mins and nothing then cars moved up in front of us so after pulling up the speaker came on and took the persons order behind us so we didn't even get order then we pull up to the window waiting for a minute then employee asked our order then we said that they didn't take our order then the manger behind the employee yelled at us to go back in line and wait, and we said no we waited 30 mins for them not to take our order then to be kicked to back for another 30 mins or longer so we sat there trying to reason and asked if they would take our order right there the manager said no go back in line and closed the down window on us and locked it, this has never that happen to me very disappointed that they wouldn't even listen to us.</review>

Usually good but at times you can tell the grease is old or the food isn't fresh smh should not have to deal with this when you are paying for a service. Most of the employees are nice though.</text>

First time trying churches chicken. And it was pretty good  ( not the best ). But still good. Got the campfire combo box  decent for the price. Just a really small serving of mash potatoes   and they were kinda salty But the chicken had a good taste as well as the biscuit    the coleslaw  on the other hand was horrible.  Not as good as KFCs or Cain's    so if I'm in the area I might stop by again. Just to see what else they got<//Review>

I had a pleasant experience here even if I was in the drive-thru, the line was really not long and it sped up which I enjoyed, the worker there helped me order my food and he was very nice, and lastly the chicken here is amazing, but those biscuits are on another levle of deliciousness.< /review>

<user>112021817480536583599<//user><review>Church's Chicken has a very good flavor to it and it is not greasy.   when I feel like having chicken for dinner but I don't want to cook it, I swing by Churches chicken and pick up myself a couple of pieces bring it home, cook some macaroni and cheese and green beans on the side, I have a complete meal and I didn't have to do much work. Church's Chicken is a good place to sit down and have a good lunch, or take some home.  The place is not very large but it is nice and clean,  plenty of parking.   Next time you get a taste for chicken go to churches Chicken and try some or take some home for dinner.< /review><Rate>4<//Rate><GmapID>0x80dca646a3d664ab:0xa5c7914cc94bf230</GmapID></record>

Make sure you check your chicken before eating it. It's more than likely NOT cooked enough. Red in the inside close to the bone. Check to see if its done< /text>

Good chicken and sides. For your best deals and prices that you wont see on their menu, look up Church's chicken coupons on google first. Good luck with your meal choice now.😊<//text>

<review>Very disappointing......you call in your order......Post mates are the carrier and delivery company......But the messed up part is that Churches take your order......it shows up sealed in a to go bag.....only to take it into our home and find a whole meal missing.......extra biscuits not in the bag.......I have the receipt and the phone number and the number isn't good....you get a mailbox that's full....and no live service.....This is pretty messed up when people feed there family and have major parts of the order missing....granted we can cook....we can drive......But was nice to order out tonight and this is what we get......Post Mates refunded us the cost of the meal and biscuits...but we can't reorder that food without paying for taxes and fee's again......So since we can't call the store...this is the post I make to try to reach out to the place.<//review><user>113433746069758962961< /user><gmap_id>0x80dca646a3d664ab:0xa5c7914cc94bf230<//gmap_id><Response>None</Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>1</Rating><Name>Shawn Schumacher</Name><date>1596503341239</date></record></dataset><record>

This was such a bad experience so yesterday January 24 I went to get some church chicken so I went to the drive thru and i couldn't see the menu so I had no car behind me so went out and saw 4 or 3 people sitting down so I thought it was open and also it was 8:56 so I got out the drive thru and went to the front door and I was locked the 4 people on the table turn and just look at me and say drive thru so I was a bit mad already so I just decided ok well let me go so I drove to the drive thru again and I just heard people talking and pans or something being dropped and I said hello expecting them to answer so I called and  called out hello for 3 minutes and finally I get a tell me when your ready to order and I said I have been for the last minute and there was no reply so I just order and the danm line took literally 10 danm minutes and the worst part is she got my sides wrong I really never ate church's chicken but definitely will never go back to one and once I got my food there was a sorry for the wait and a laugh so If i could I'd give a zero star.</text>

dining area dirty, bathroom scary dirty, we had a senior that needed extra assistance with sides, and they let me order to piece together what I needed for my grandbaby and had a deal that wasn't suggested which make you guys look like you don't care about the people and when I saw that I cancel that order and reordered...that could have been avoided. We love Churches but that location does not care or work with your customers. that is the third visit where the customers were complaining, told them there concerns and each time were ignored.<//Text>

Always went here before come from Temecula and it was always fantastic yesterday when we went it was horrible they gave us like in the 9 Piece mixed we got like four little half breasts that were so hard you could not eat them the breast probably have been laying up there for 6 7 hours and a couple chickens were good and the coleslaw is different from a couple months ago the coleslaw is Big pieces and no flavor I was just very disappointed and I won't go back I don't know if they got a new manager or what but it was horrible and we spent $28 on horrible I guess I'll just go to Pioneer or maybe not there either I don't care for their chicken that much it's not the quality of churches but anyway do stars only because the chicken nugget things we're okay my son said alright. thanks< /text>

< Review>
I can see why there are so many varied reviews. This was my first time going to Church's Chicken since I was a kid. I can't complain too much! I was only in line for a hot minute, I ordered the three piece and a biscuit for 2.99 and they gave me an extra piece of chicken without my asking. The skin was really tasty and crispy, the meat itself could have cooked just a little bit longer for me and dried out just a little bit. The biscuit had great flavor-  I enjoy my food cooked a certain way, and the biscuit had an interesting little crisp to it which I really enjoyed, although I could totally understand if others might consider the biscuit too "hard"...The server was nice and a little silly, but he's just a kid so it was fine. Overall it was a nice first experience, would  I go back? Yes I would.<//Review>

<Text>Had one of the worst experiences. I picked up two combos and my chicken tenders were absolutely terrible not to mention that the inside was green with a cooked label. Disgusting.

Waited 25 minutes for 1 three piece special. When I asked if I could ordered two more and that I would park and wait, I was told I have to wait another 25 minutes for the two extra orders. This is on the day they have their three piece special. You would think they would prepare enough Chicken on the day they offer this special. Also some of their employees are not well-versed in customer service.<//review>

<user_name>Nita W<//user_name><rate>1<//rate><Review>Please dont waste your time like I did. I went here and the chicken was sickening. It was extra salty to mask  the spoiled meat . The fries were old and nasty. The crew were all males. The youngest and inexperienced on drive thru.
Im disabled and had someone to take me to get some dinner. Once home and settled, I called them to say it was wrong and to notify the store. They played phone games like pressing redial...as if I dont know the sound.  I could hear them breathing in the phone.  I said to them I was calling the health department and corporate office since they are selling bad food. Then they hung up the phone. I will be taking it back me and my family only ate off 1 piece each we didnt eat the whole piece before feeling it wasn't right.
I will be calling corporate and health department, because I'm tired of companies feeling like they can get over in people all the time.
Remember you have been warned. Please don't go here.< /Review>< response>

I don't know how this location has people giving it 5 stars but for this past year its been a bad experience each time, and i've been coming to this location for years! Every single time, they mix up my order, or forget my sides, and each time I politely ask them to fix it and they always have an attitude, or I get to watch the manager yell at his workers right in from of me and its extremely uncomfortable. Also lately they have been undercooking their biscuits and it makes me so sad because those biscuits were the best!<//review>

Terrible window service. Although the guy inside was nice the girl at the window was horrible waited in drive thru forever just to be told I had to go around again because when I came through the first time there was no one at speaker because she was busy and had to go back around because she has orders now. Her fault but I had to go all the way to the end of line. I just went inside no compensation< /review>

So me and my family went to church’s chicken never been there before . It wasn’t really an inviting place , it was like a prison having to ask for literally everything . The soda machines were turned off , you have to ask just for them to turn it on in order for you to get a refill . And when asking if we can replace a side with another side , they say they weren’t allowed to do that . And another is the have corn on the cob there but yet when asking for butter they said they didn’t have butter there. That place wasn’t satisfying at all. And to top it off someone went to the restroom and it was like a hawk looking at its prey . They were talking saying watch out for that person blah blah blah acting if that person was gonna rob then all he did was use the restroom . All I have to say is never again.</Text>

I went there a few months ago ( this past summer) and I felt that the customer service could have been better. It seemed like the staff would get irritated when black customers would order and ask questions...which is sad since the food being served is culturally black american (and anyone else with southern roots) cuisine. The restrooms were also filthy.<//Text>

Not the Churches I remember. With that being said, over priced chicken, french fries, okra, biscuits, and fountain drinks. All for you to get rotten service. Chicken was not freshly cooked, at these prices, I do expect freshly cooked chicken, fries, okra.... Just sickening, wasted my money and what a disappoinment to my stomach, that was oh so awaiting some good ole greasy chicken and sh@%!<//Review>

<Review>Most places you go to an 8 piece mixed is 2 each: legs, thighs,  wings and breasts. Not here.  They only give you two pieces of white meat and upcharge you for additional white meat. I'd that it's how your doing things, you put it on the coupon.</Review>< userid>

<review>This Church's made me wait inside for several minutes while waiting on drive-thru. My total order was 3 of the $5 big deal....supposed to be mixed all we got was dark. The man who waited on me got mad cause he was speaking to fast and his accent made it impossible for me to understand ao he got an attitide with me. My husband was upset cause the food tasted like old grease. So no I doubt we ever go back to this Church's.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I'm a little skeptical about this place...I have eaten here a few times, and had no complaints but it has recently been closed for a short time due to health violations...personally, once a place has been closed by the board of health...I stay away for good...if a store is closed for violations for not taking care of their store in the first place, what makes you think they would care enough about cleanliness to give them a second chance?<//review>

Always and I mean always check your order!
This location is notorious for giving you the wrong stuff just to clear the drive-thru!
Seriously, they will just throw whatever in your bag to keep the line moving.
They've got me on a few occasions.
Then,  they never answer the phone when you call to complain.
On second thought,  just go some where else.</text><rate>3< /rate></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) This restaurant was recommended by a local friend who lives here.
It's crispy fried so it tastes good.
I personally like the TENDER STRIPS + COLE SLAW combination.
It's open until 10pm. Go around 9 pm and lock the door.
However, I think the drive through is by 10 o'clock.

(Original)
여기에 사는 현지인 친구에서 추천 받은 식당인데요.
바삭하게 튀겨내서 식감이 좋아요.
개인적으로 TENDER STRIPS + COLE SLAW 조합이 좋아요.
영업시간이 오후10시까지인데요. 오후9시쯤에 가면 매장 문을 잠금.
단, 드라이브 스루는 10시까지 하는 것 같아요.<//review>
