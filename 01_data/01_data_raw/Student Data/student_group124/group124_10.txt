< review>
As soon as you walk in, you're automatically greeted by Don Francisco himself on a mural wall. I absolutely loved that. The smell was on point and the chips to a crisp. The young man that took our order was really nice and prompt. Decided to eat there (outside only due to pandemic) and their patio tables and chairs were nice not destroyed at all by outside elements. Our food arrived in a acceptable time frame. We decided to try their burritos' (1carne asada,1carnitas) and they did NOT disappoint. So delicious 🤤, my husband ate the whole thing but I could only finish half.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for real authentic taste.< /review>

Great food! Unfortunately, they are NOT enforcing the mask policy. Two men were inside the building without masks on while I was waiting for my order and not once I heard an employee tell them to put their masks on or wait outside.< /text>

Tacos were as ordered and plenty of meat with homemade salsa, could've used an extra one of those, however I am sure they would've gave it to me had I asked, 5 stars and would stop here again if I was in the area.<//Text>< Name>

< review>
At the risk of contradicting so many 5 Stars reviews, I must say that our visit today to Don Pancho’s was not the magical 5 stars we were led to believe. I can appreciate the high grades, but since food in general is not judged by anything more than taste, I find it doubtful that this place deserves 5 stars. Food ordered:
2 Large Albóndigas Soup, 8.98? Only the seriously ethnic Mexican places present this soup on their menu. One in every ten, perhaps. Don Pancho’s offered not one kind, but three: beef, chicken and albondigas. The fact that those three offerings probably share the same broth, is another matter. The albóndigas (Mexican style meatballs) were small, easy to eat, and plentiful. Carrots, Zucchini, badly done Potatoes, Cilantro, Onions, Limes, Corn 🌽 Tortillas, all in a mild broth that was not unappetizing, and kudos for what appeared a freshly made, thicker than most, corn tortillas.
Now, that it took a dismal long time to arrive, indicated that perhaps the selection is not very popular, but the fact they make, counts. 4 Stars.
Fish Taco, $2.99. Nothing to scream at the sea about. Seen and tasted better, but edible never the less, with it’s fair amount of fresh cabbage, and an orange sauce that did not impress. 3 Stars.
Chips were free and nice. Salsa decent, but certainly no top contender. Water, surprisingly acceptable, no dubious after taste. Tried a small amount of a couple of their salsas. I basically just went to their small salsa bar, was I supposed to? Average tasting. Service at the hands of an almost do it all young man was slow, infuriatingly so, but his demeanor entirely professional, where you got to like him regardless. A female assistant showed twice, hard worker one could tell. Place active, it does have movement. 3.5 Stars.<//review>

The 3rd time we went the service was not good.  The server told us to go ahead and sit at table, we never saw him again.  We were seated for about 20 minutes still no drinks and other people being seated got there orders taken.  After half hour we left.   All 3 times we had the same server, other two times he took forever with taking any of our orders for food and drinks.  If not for this problem we would go back.</text>< pics>

The food was really good. I had carne asada tacos the homemade corn tortillas were the cherry on top!! My husband had the crispy potato tacos which were delicious too... the California carne asada and chicken asada burritos and chicken taquitos were a hit with the kids! It was our first try and we'll definitely be back even though we live about 20 minutes by freeway!!</text>

<text>I just when to use the restroom. I just ask direction to their restroom. Later to find out the owner with no question pointed the place.  As I walk out I bought 3 tortas. I told because you did not hassle me for using your restroom  I'm going to buy some found. I did and it was tasty,All the workers are a great reflection of the owner. Price are what to expect wit raising wages.< /text><Time>1559433794681</Time>< pics>

Small Mexican restaurant located in a strip center off Clinton Keith. The service was good and the food was pretty good as well. The salsa was the winner. I would definitely visit again. It is not the best atmosphere if you are looking for that but for a quick and tasty meal, it is fine.< /review>

I have been coming to this restaurant since they opened. I love the fact that the owners cast their own shadow over their crop. Truly a blessing to have such great food and a warm family welcome every time you come in. Thanks Yesenia for always making me feel at home<//Review>

$1.50 taco Tuesday there was a little wait, as they busy, I heard that 6:30 is a good time to go. Food was good. There was a salsa station, good too. Waitress was awesome. No name tags though. Overall it was good food. Good staffing and as you watch them work they work fast. But their orders were stacked. They do offer chips and salsa for curbing the hungery ones. And they're good with lime squeezed on them. I'd go back.<//Review>

<Text>This place was surprising we went and had dinner and it was delicious everything was clean the service is good andreal friendly we went here because of the good reviews and said well I just can't believe it's this good all the time and it wasn't that slow so we decided to come back the next day which would be taco Tuesday and see how it is in a wow back-to-back good food extremely good service they were packed and kept busy and yet they found time by helping each other and that surprised me as well. we're going to go back probably sooner than we usually go back to another restaurant because I just can't believe how good it's been. So we will be back again to wait for the other shoe to drop. And believe me this is just a small hole in the wall place that's clean foods great service is great the got to be some weaknesses here or we're going to find them because you're coming back again in a couple days we'll get back to you then.</Text>< pics>

Great food and friendly staff. Tuesday taco night is our favorite time to go, but it's also everyone else's favorite time too. It's worth the wait if you get there during the rush. They also have a full bar.< /text>

We have never been here before and it is going to be a place we frequent from now on. We don't live in Wildomar but Don Pancho's Chilie Verde Burrito made me cry. I'm not even the biggest fan of pork. The food took me back to my childhood and there was a little hole in the wall Mexicqn Food place my grandma used to take us to that had awesome burritos. Don Pancho's food is so fresh, no grease, they use real ingredients that you can tell they actually chop and prepare by hand. My burrito was so good and the pork was so flavorful and deliciously tender. The sauce was so good too and not overly spicy. The staff makes the restraunt great. They were so warm and friendly it felt like you were coming home to eat. I listened to the wait staff and they were taking their time visiting with each table of customers but never being neglectful of the other guests needs. Very very clean, smelled so delicious when we got in. It was slow when we got there but oh man did it get packed quick. I give this a 15 out of 10 stars. Just one of the best experiences I've ever had. I left full, happy and with old memories floating in and out that were making me cry a little bit. Just great.<//text>

<Review>We stop for lunch. The giro taking orders ingnor us for at least 15 minutes. The lady that helps with cleaning tables was very attentive and she brought our drinks promptly than she keep coming back to ask if we needed anything while we where waiting. I am sure she gets paid as a dishwasher but she is more like a waiters.< /Review>< pics>

Our food was cold and the beans were like soup they were so watered down. The place was dirty and we had to ask for them to wipe the dirty table off that they seated us at. The floors were filthy!!  On the other hand...the people were very nice but that didn’t make up for the awful food!! Don’t waist your money or time, we would have been better off going to Del Taco a block up the street.< /review></record>

<text>The waiter and bus boy were rude. I needed to use the restroom, when for some reason they decided to not acknowledge me while they blocked the hallway to the bathroom. I literally had to squeeze past them to get to the restroom. It was very uncomfortable and I did not feel welcome. I felt like I was treated like a non-person for some supercilious prerogative, it was a very ridiculous manner of employee.</text></record>

Food was delicious.  Service is great.  One of our go-to Mexican dine in restaurants.  Not the most spacious on the inside but they do have patio seating.</Review>

Everything in this place is homemade.  It's nice to be able to enjoy that experience.  Their service is fabulous.  We were not that hungry when we stopped in so next time I will order more.  But their carne asada sope was delicious and I had them too it with guacamole instead of sour cream. Yummy!< /Text>

<review>Absolutely love this place! The owners are wonderful, the staff is very friendly and attentive. The food is delicious!!! Our family comes here at least once a week. If you've never tried it, you need to give it a try. My kids love the breakfast burritos and Carne Asada fries. My husband and I have tried many different dishes and have not found one we didn't like.<//review><resp>None<//resp><time>1479068839468</time>< Name>

Awesome little hole-in-the-wall taco joint. We ordered the Barbacoa & Polo Asado platters and they were delicious. The service was also excellent. Very friendly staff. Highly recommended.

Update: Been a few times now & service is still excellent. Food is still excellent but we did have one occasion where it was not hot. Still recommended.< /text>

Great Mexican food at reasonable prices. Wait staff is friendly and quick.  One of my favorite places to eat in Murrieta.

EDIT: After several years of eating here I finally tried the Chiliquilas platter (sp?).  OMG, my new favorite comfort food, not to mention the portion is huge.<//text>

(Translated by Google) They do not take good care of it and apart from that I got a hair on my petite and the lady that I told her still wants me to put another one if the hair was on the petite and she still makes fun of me because I discreetly told her or because she thought it was very I am not delicate at all, but I am delicate, but if I pay for food, I hope that I attend well and that the food is clean, not with a man's hair 😡😡😡😡😡

Quick service. Good customer service. Make sure you make an appointment ahead of time. It also helps to call and see if they can get you in sooner than your appointment says. I’m really happy about the service I received here.</text>

I came here for my SENTRI pass interview.  I am glad I chose this place.  The directions were very clear on how to get here and where to park, as well as where to go.  Everyone was really friendly.  For some reason I was expecting the opposite.  In case you are wondering, there is a restroom here, in the waiting area of the SENTRI enrollment office.  I arrived 15 minutes early, and waited in line for about 10 minutes.  For that reason, I would suggest you arrive at least 15 minutes before your interview time.  The person doing my interview was really cool and nice.  After I was done with the interview, then I had to wait for the cashier.  If you guessed she was really nice, then you were right!< /text>

I found the location easily using the directions from the email but because of the reviews I arrived 30 minutes early thinking I would get in and out. I wasn’t taken for the global entry interview until 30 mins AFTER my scheduled appointment time... which means I waited for an hour. Once I was called back the process only took like 5 minutes. I just wish I was taken back at least when I had my appointment. People that arrived after me were called before me... (maybe they have less employees working global entry interviews than employees for the SENTRI customers??)

Anyways I suggest you get there ON TIME cause theres no point in getting there early and waiting extra time if they don’t take you back early.

My appointment was on a Wednesday at 9:45am so maybe that is a busy time and you shouldn’t schedule around then.</Text>

Getting my Global Entry membership through the CBP took 8 days total, from application to approval! I had my interview at the San Ysidro Enrollment Center and they were efficient, respectful and very professional from the personnel at the counter to the interviewing officer. Kudos to this government agency for their outstanding service to the public.<//Review>

Excellent service getting my Global Entry.  I arrived early for my 3:15 PM apt, got checked in within about two minutes.  Waited to be called for maybe 10 minutes (my arrival was at about 2:40 PM).  I was called to the window, and the very nice gentleman asked me a few questions, took, my photo and fingerprints.  I had a slight problem with the fingerprints, since I cannot extend my right pinky, so they adjusted to let me use 3 fingers on my right hand.  I was approved and back in my car and on my way home at 3:10 PM.  Amazing!< /Text>

I was here a few weeks ago for my mom's sentri interview and have to say that I was impressed by the professionalism of the agent that handled her case. He asked a few questions, she paid her fees and we were out of there in less than 30 minutes.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service and very friendly attention in person and by phone. They really help you and get you out of business. Almost anyone can apply and have the opportunity to complete the procedure and facilitate border crossing. The appointment system is very punctual and it works. Hopefully this system will be used in other government agencies.

This was just for a consultation / no actual dental work but I found the office to be very clean and a comfortable environment using safety protocols and products that are environmentally friendly. I will update once I have work done, but found it to be a good experience so far.<//Text>

<Review>Everyone at Sunnyvale Dental Group is warm, friendly, and patient. They have been truly terrific with my daughter who can sometimes times get nervous during dental visits. I really appreciate their care and expertise and would highly recommend them! It is also a big plus that they practice holistic dentistry!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

Excellent service. They truly care about your teeth and overall health. Real holistic dentistry, don’t waste your time with fake clinics, and come here. They are the real deal. Prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly.
Great office , easy to find location and large parking lot.< /Text>

Excellent safety precautions in place. Highly skilled and personable staff. Dr. Hilado is flexible and knowledgeable. She listens and compromises and shows compassion as well as wisdom. She is up on the latest holistic procedures. The space is warm, inviting and sparkling clean.< /Review>

Dr. Kris communicated well to me in every way-professionally and in regards to when she would perform some action.  There were no surprises.
The dental assistant was very unobtrusive inside my mouth-the best I’ve ever had.
Thank you for the time you’ve spent to develop such thoughtfulness.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Great place for dental work. Very clean and all employees are caring and courteous. Lynn is one of the greatest dental hygienist of all time. She should be in the hall of fame dental world. Her attitude and hard work is undeniable. Thank you Sunnyvale dental for all you’ve done for me to keep my teeth healthy and strong.<//Review>

Had my first experience with an ultrasound water pick which is used for cleanings at Sunnyvale Dental Group.  Took the time to scrape my teeth and really show the reasons why my teeth are collecting so much plaque.  Had my first crown here and the attention to detail performed by Dr. Hilado was very impressive. Super minimalist approach, she even hand dug the final bits of decay as to not disturb the nerve under my tooth.  Very quick when it comes to doing fillings/crowns.  Uses fillings/crowns without heavy metals (porcelain for my crown) and is very excited about using new technology in the industry.  Entire staff and front desk are super friendly.  They are happy to go over what is and is not covered by insurance.  If you have to wait ten minutes for your scheduled appointment, relax and read one of the cool books in the office,  its worth the wait for best tooth care in the Bay. P.S. Ozone therapy for $70, can't beat it.<//Review>

The $$ amount is not significant but it is the principle that matters. NO!

<Review>I ALWAYS feel as though Lynn has my best interest in mind. I feel a warmth from her, that she sincerely cares about me. She considers my needs and my safety before advising something about which I might be concerned, such as the necessity, number, and frequency of x-rays. Our world is in serious need of ethical practitioners and Lynn is, hands down, one answer to that call!< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Response>

So grateful I found this dental practice.  All the staff are kind, professional, and helpful.  Dr. Hilado is extremely knowledgeable and excellent at her profession while still being sensitive to each patient’s individual needs and comfort levels.  I love the holistic approach which is entirely in line with my approach to health and body care.  My whole family (including my young children) sees Dr. Hilado for our dental care.  Five stars is not enough!</Review>

<Text>If you are looking for a great dentist and exceptional hygienist, you have found the right team. Dr. Kris Hilado has a steady hand, excellent eye, and is very gentle. She gets bite fitment on fillings right the first time and has been able to correct issues with old fillings that I had given up on. Lynn Santos is always very thorough and takes extra care around sensitive areas. They are holistic in their approach to dentistry and use very good composites. I have been coming here for several years now and have had no issues with any of the work.</Text>< name>

<Review>We love this holistic dental practice and highly recommend it to all of our friends and family!

All four of our kids (ages 8-13) love having their teeth cleaned by Lynn.  She is very knowledgeable, gentle and through.

Dr Kris does outstanding work and uses proven materials that won't damage your health!  She recently replaced my last two amalgams with porcelain.  They match so well that you can no longer tell I have fillings in my teeth and I had absolutely no negative health repercussions during or after the removal (despite being sensitive).<//Review></record>

I so love the atmosphere of the clinic, the huge  himalayan salt lamp in the receiving area looks so beautiful. As a crunchy mom i wanted to make sure my family is handled by a well informed health care provider and Dr. Kris Hilado is the best! She is very excellent and passionate in her job, giving top quality care treatments and recommendations. We are willing to travel from Fremont to Sunnyvale just to have our smiles fixed. Thanks to this awesome clinic 😘< /text>

<review>Dr. Chris Hilado is the best Dentist I have ever had.  I can HIGHLY recommend her. Anyone fearing going to the dentist, fear no more. One time I almost fell asleep while she was fixing a cavity. This was incredible. She is the best Dentist to work with, listens to your needs and is just an overall very pleasant person.

Happy to finally have found a dentist that I will keep, I love everything about Dr. Hilado, I highly recommend her!<//review>< gmapID>

I've had good experiences with this office. They were the ones who removed the mercury from past tooth fillings and discovered a cavity on an X-ray that my previous dentist had missed.  For this visit I had scheduled due to some teeth sensitivity (brushing too hard) and some discomfort chewing. I liked how the problem was isolated to my gums and thank God my teeth seemed to be OK (an X-ray revealed no issues). So the issue was taking care of the current teeth sensitivity while the gums heal. I was given the options of a filling or something called  I-M paste. My insurance wouldn't cover a filling since this area was previously taken care of and it wasn't over 24 months yet. I'm glad that I checked the ingredients of the I-M paste as it contains casein and I have to be dairy-free. When I asked if there were any other alternatives I was offered ozone treatment that would help heal the tubules and mitigate the discomfort.  This seemed the best option since it was quick (less than 5 minutes) and painless. I had originally leaned toward a filling but wasn't guaranteed that it would work since the issue was on the side of my teeth.  I'm wondering why the ozone option wasn't presented at the beginning when talking about treatments? I may have given the impression I was concerned about cost but if it is effective and quick, then it's worth it to me. 2 days later my teeth sensitivity is still being kept at bay so I am happy.< /review>

<Review>I'm not sure if this is the same or different owner but this place is now called "Footy Rooty" and the greeter said they are different owners but they have the same phone #. He gave me the new "Happy Day" location card so I sure hope I can use my 1 hour massage bucks there because I spent a lot of money on them before Covid and didn't get to use them.  I will delete this review when/if they are professional and I have it all sorted out. Hope this helps someone.

As for Footy Rooty - I did end up staying  since I drove a far drive to come here and paid out of pocket. The massage was great but the room smelled like wet, dirty carpet. Also my sheets did not look like they were clean/changed. :(</Review>< user>

It is very clean and the people who run the business are lovely. Unlike the Happy Day Spa, you can remove clothing to your comfort level. The rooms are individual, simple and immaculate. The massage table was comfortable and heated if you want. This was first time at this location. Toni did an excellent deep tissue massage.

For everyone complaining about the tip thing most of them work basically only for tips... that’s why the massage is so cheap. The tip goes to the masseuse the rest goes to location. If you goto someone who doesn’t rely on tips they typically charge 160 to 200 for an hour massage. So don’t be stingy. And keep that in mind< /Text>

<Text>I wasn't gonna leave a bad review until the guy at the front desk stopped me and said that I forgot to leave a tip, demanding one because I said the massage was okay. I didn't forget because I wasn't going to, I paid for services but I didnt feel like they went beyond my expectations. First of all there is no private room, so we had to change in open space. It was freezing in there. The atmosphere isn't relaxing at all, everything is old and squeaky, no music, no pleasent smell. The massage wasn't the best, she kept hurting me even after I told her numerous times to go easy.  I left more tense than when I came in.  I never felt so uncomfortable, I know I definitely won't be coming back.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The combo  90 minute massage with foot massage was the BEST I've ever had, and I've had some massages. 😉 I would recommend this location to anyone who enjoys  quiet time to allow the stress and tenseness of our bodies to relax and heal.<//text>

<review>I had a 90 minute massage, the massage was ok, but the room smelled of chlorine (glad it's clean, but wow that's not a relaxing smell) and it was silent which made it a little awkward. Before doing a temple and scalp massage the masseuse used germ-x antibacterial gel which has a strong smell and burned a bit on my recently sun over-exposed hairline. All in all, the 90 minutes went fast and it wasn't a bad experience, it just wasn't as soothing and relaxing as I had hoped it would be.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>This was the worst massage I've ever received. I am a 110 pound female but she treated me like I was a 300 pound guy! I said it was too hard, but she seemed to get rougher.
She literally "hit" me on my feet and along my spine several times. During half of the massage I was under the covers and she applied all her weight on my arms and legs. I thought my bones were going to break from the pressure. One of my wrists is still sore.
I tried to explain that I had a headache/ migraine, had a cold/was sick, etc....but there was a language barrier and the massage was not personalized to my needs at all.
My students gave me a gift card which I used to purchase a Groupon here. Unfortunately I felt worse after the massage.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pictures>

<review>If I could give zero stars I would. The guy Tony at the front desk needs to get a job WITHOUT customer service because he doesn't know what that is! When calling to make the appointment he was short, rude and cut me off multiple times. After my massage he told me I owed more $ then just my Groupon because of different location costs... Never heard of such a thing. Upset I told him to take it out of the tip and he made a scene stating "WOW". WHAT A JERK. NEVER GO HERE.<//review>< rating>

<review>I don't think everyone is licensed. Hopefully you get a good massage, my masseuse didn't know what a pressure point was or speak english, but sure knew what a tip was.. waiting for me outside my exit door with a black tip book.lol one cannot get out without tipping... but i had her tip, she deserved 2$ but i have her 25% as she TRIED VERY HARD.</review>< name>

<text>Horrible!  My husband specifically requested a female and after digging her knuckles into his back for 30 minutes another man walked in demanding a female so she left him to give the other guy a massage and they had a male finish the massage.  To make matters worse the receptionist told my husband he should leave a tip for the male masseuse.  Weve been going to other happy day spas for year and my husband said it was the worst massage hes ever had!!  Would suggest going to another location!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Massage was ok (felt very sore for a few days) but, I had purchased a Groupon an upgraded the time. I had to put the tip and upgrade on my credit card. I went to my car afterwards and started checking all my messages about five minutes later I heard someone yelling. I looked over and the masseuse was standing outside my window saying " you no like, you no like? no tip no tip" she was very angry.  I tried to tell her that the man had her tip. She just gave me dirty looks and yelled until the guy at the front desk yelled for her.  It was so rude I will never go back.< /text>< date>

<time>1497660616885</time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I get adjustments and massages regularly because I work for a chiropractor.  On Tuesday, I went to New Happy Day Spa on greenback lane because my sister bought a groupon for mother's day.  However my experience was less then pleasant as my masseuse did not do a good job and put me in a lot of pain.  He was extremely rough like he was starting a chainsaw or something, I had asked him a few times to maybe go a little easier, but he continued to work at the same rough pace. It was almost like he was trying to adjust me the way he tugged and pulled at my body. I know that some people prefer a harder massage, but if you are getting a massage because you've been injured or just want to relax,  I would go elsewhere as these masseuse do not listen to their clients. I have been adjusted 3 times this week and have had to get another massage to try to decrease the pain. I have had many massages in the past but have never been as sore as I am today. I am not blasting New Happy Day Spa as I have been to other chains and have had a pleasant experiences, but the one on Greenback needs to seriously improve their masseuse techniques< /Text>< Pictures>

Terrible customer service!! Massage was too rough and masseuses couldn't understand English to understand the request of lighter pressure, leaving us both in pain today. I didn't feel a tip was earned, but I decided to leave one anyway.. When I asked for change for a $20 bill the masseuse was visibly upset that he didn't just give him the whole bill!! I'm definitely NOT coming back here!!</review>

I've been in pain for nearly a month after getting a massage there. I will Never return again. I was massaged by a tall male and mid way the massage sat down on a rolling chair and Massaged me with only one hand. It felt like he was falling asleep. Terrible experience<//review>

<Text>Just the worst experience ever!!! Had a couples massage and they were extremely rough and we’re both coughing constantly. My wife has black eyes and a swollen face from the man who was extremely rough when rubbing her face. Both our backs are tore up I have no idea how these people can ask for tips it’s  extremely Awkward when you exit and there right there with there tip books. The two seed munchers up front are rude as well !!! Should have the name changed to Abuse day spa! Never again!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Never been here, but looked at their online store and called the shop to purchase a bottle last minute for a friend to pick up. This was a special pick up since my friend was bridal dress shopping at the bridal boutique on the same block. Dawn from this shop was courteous and took her time to help me over the phone. My friend picked up her gift and was very pleased. Thank you!! Will definitely stop by when I am in the area.< /Review>

The Wine Steward is a great shop in downtown Pleasanton. It has been run by locals for decades, and they are very knowledgeable, helpful, and super friendly. They have the daunting task of trying to compete with higher volume sellers like grocery stores and specialty stores like BevMo, etc. But, they find a variety of ways to add value and earn your business, including facilitating a bunch of different wine clubs. They have personal reviews of wines that are very helpful, and their prices are competitive. In addition they have a wide enough variety of bottles to choose from across a myriad of varietals to make the most discerning wine enthusiast happy. Stop by and give them a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.</Text>

Local and global wines that are well thought.  Nice food and drink selections and go upstairs to taste, sample wine flights or get a craft beer. Very attentive service and nice snack options.< /Text>

The upstairs wine bar is a great find!  Awesome cheese and charcuterie plate.  Buy a bottle over $25 downstairs and free corkage!  Wine btg is reasonably priced as well. Great selection.<//text>

I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews, my wife and I just rented out a new apartment through this company, had some minor issues that had to be taken care of before we moved in, and they handled it promptly and swiftly. They have helped us whenever we've had questions and are very easy to work with. Not to mention they processed and approved our application only within a few days. Daniel is super helpful.< /Review>

I know they are working hard to provide good service to their tenants because they are too busy to answer the phone.  And they have a convenient place where tenants can leave rent and maintenance requests 24 hours (a slot in what looks like a jailhouse door).   What better service and care could one desire?<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b43689e8d239:0x5a83f5e9d3c4e09c</gmapID></record>

Hopefully this will save someone else the misery they put me through. DO NOT APPLY!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!

Long story short, I applied for an apt, they approved my app, but did not choose me for the unit I was applying for. Which is fine because they keep your file for 3months so that you can apply for other rentals they have listed.

I was in the process of applying for a different unit, when the owner Cathy says, "Hey the unit you originally applied for is now available again under weird circumstances. I'm offering it to you, I just need to get the unit cleaned again, I'll have the keys by Friday. Are you interested?" I say yes...

The Thursday before I'm supposed to have the keys, I CALL HER and she tells me "Sorry I can no longer offer you that unit."

I had already packed my whole apt and now I'm still looking for a place because I wasted my time waiting for Jenkins Poor Management.< /Review>

< Review>
I have had no problems with Jenkins Property Management. I didn't have my deposit ready for my first interview (Come to your interviews ready with deposit, money order only, in hand) so I didn't get the first apartment I wanted. My property manager/interviewer was super nice and recommended I go look at another specific location. I loved this apartment even better than the first. It's an old building so I've had some issues with bugs but Jenkins has sprayed for me when I asked them too. I haven't tried to move out yet so I don't know if they will try to stiff me on the deposit but so far they been very good to me, fresh out of college with no rental history and plenty of debt.</Review>

Rented for 3 years never any problems. Relocating back but will have to check on some better property managers it seems. I could deal with one disgruntle person but its many. To bad.

False listing on Zillow. Claimed a small one bedroom one bathroom place was 2100 ft.², but is actually about 700 ft.² I mention this to the girl who was show me the place, she said you can’t trust the third-party sites like Zillow. When you look on Zillow it says the entry was created by Jenkins the landlord.< /Review>

These people are racially bias when renting out properties. My wife and I make more than 5 fives the asking rent for one of their properties, and our credit scores are both above 700, but we (a black family of four) DON'T QUALIFY for a house in an affluent neighborhood.

THEY'RE RACIST!!!

I read their reviews and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, but BIG MISTAKE!!! DON'T NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE. THEY'RE A HORRIBLE COMPANY.<//text>

<Review>Tried to rent a place at the listed rate.  Prepared my application.  Upon presenting my application to the manager, she declared that the monthly rate was increased by $50 of the price listed.  Even their most recent flyer had the price lower.  Seems like the company likes to show lower listing prices, but then when you go to rent, they jack up the prices and try to convince you to rent at a higher monthly rate.  Why would I want to rent at $600 more a year when competitors are renting at the lower rates.

Poor business.  The office was no help either.  Deceptive business.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Jenkins Property Management is unprofessional, condisening, confusing and unpleasant. My husband and I were looking to rent a home, we found a home we liked in Redondo Beach that was managed by Jenkins PM. When I read the reviews I didn’t want to deal with them but I learned that after they rented this home we wouldn’t be dealing with Jenkins but rather with the owner directly. The office staff in my opinion were not pleasant aside from Dee and Luis, everyone else that I dealt with were consinding. My husband and I are currently renting (paying the same price currently as the cost of this new home is), we have perfect renting history, PM (property management referrals), we qualify financially as well yet we were treated like second class citizens. The next day we get a call saying due to credit, we were denied. I’m so confused as our credit is over 800. There was no explanation given and they hung up. I will never do business with them again and I advise each of you reading this review to go with your gut on this one and look elsewhere. I had a really bad feeling doing business with them and now I’m so confused as to what actually happened and what the real reason for denial was. Very disappointing experience overall.< /review>< Rating>

They will raise your rent without notice. They raised my rent this month they did not give any notice and just demanded I pay the new amount. I have been trying to contact them for a week now but they will not return calls. I have left voice mails for them everyday but they do not call me back. I am still a tenant in their roach infested apartment. I find roaches that are 2 inches big in my apartment every day. They send an exterminator that uses the same stuff I buy from Amazon and it doesn't work. He tried to blame me for shopping at Costco saying their boxes are filled with roaches.< /text>

<Text>Just don't do it, look for another place.

This review is redundant at this point, but from my personal experience with this company all that they have to offer is discrimination and incompetence. How many more 1 star reviews must there be to dissuade  you? Just forget the property you're considering even exists.

The most that this company has to offer is an underhand toss of a lawsuit to anyone who could tolerate spending more than five minutes near these people.< /Text>< user_name>

This place is a joke. The lady who answers the phone was the same person I spoke to in person about several units available.  She told me to provide her with an ID and 20 bucks refundable but I didnt have the cash. I told her I'll be RIGHT BACK and it took me 5 mins only to find out she gave the only key left to another person.  What kind of customer service is that?     Not a good way to start a business relationship.< /Text>

<Review>My daughter and I completed the application process, went through the interview and received a call about an hour later. We were told the application was rejected because the phone number of our current manager was incorrect. I have called Jenkins at least 6 times to give the correct phone number. I spoke to the person that interviewed us and he was rude, not helpful at all and told me "I don't know what to tell you". I have not received a call back from the application process dept yet. this has been a frustrating experience and I will not recommend Jenkins to anyone. They do not even have the professional ability to respond and give me a definite yes or no answer about whether or not the phone number mistake can be corrected. Shame on them.< /Review>< pics>

<review>If you are a tenant, please stay away. They gave us such a hard time submitting an application. After a week I was told that my application had been rejected due to my credit, fine. Buuut, then I came across the same house they had for rent on Craigslist and they reposted it with a higher rent. That seemed a little shady to me. Makes it seem like they are taking advantage of the application fees, I had to pay $60 just to submit an application.<//review></record>

I have lived in my building three months.  A very nice building but they changed my move in date twice and gave me less than 24 hour notice making my life crazy trying to reschedule movers and changing days of time to take work off. It takes days to get phone calls returned and I had to leave multiple messages. My apartment was not ready when my move in date came.  I had to sit with my stuff outside of my apartment for hours before i could move it in and they said they would come back to set up my intercom and clean my balcony.  I am on my fourth month here my balcony has not been cleaned and they barely connected my intercom.  I was told my issues were not a priority even though these items are listed on my contract and i pay for them monthly. Treated very rudely accused of having someone else live in my apartment and they wanted to raise my rent. Think twice before renting from them they are very unprofessional I cannot wait for my lease to be over.</review>

This management place just care about the rent, there's a building they manage on Torrance Blvd in the city of Torrance nobody even cleans that building I've seen tenants cleaning it themselves no manager there, they just broke into one of the tenants apartment few days ago the only thing they did was put the window back to its place they also even stole the coins from the washers and dryers they have there cars get broken in often and they won't even invest in a security system if anybody still wants to rent there is under your own risk I know all this because my friend lives there and he's moving soon thats why they have an apartment for rent on 1537 TORRANCE BLVD<//Text>

Lo malo de esto q uno no puede poner 0 estrellas la verdad y gracias a Dios tengo para pagarles la renta, pero esta gente discrimina a las personas que no tenemos un número seguro social, porque si no tenemos no nos rentan, se me hace un requisito estupido, aparte de que cuando llamas dicen que no tienen personas que hablan español y cuando les dicen que si discriminan por no tener un número seguro social entonces si te pasan a alguien en español para que te explique según ellos, muy pésima atención y a mi parecer racistas y discriminan a las personas por no tener un número, como si el número pagará la renta!

<Date>1621428949712<//Date><resp>None< /resp><text>Visited the store to get more info on saving on our bill or possibly switching over to Tmobile from Sprint. The manager greeted us, went to the back and called on a staff member to help because he was helping another customer. Areli J. was so rude. She looked upset and annoyed. Maybe she was on her break or having lunch and was interrupted and took it out on us. I was patient and friendly regardless. Eventhough we had our masks on i can see the eyerolls and huffing and puffing everytime I asked a question. Im never one to write bad reviews but thats how annoyed and frustrated iam with her particular service. I will be notifying tmobile directly. Thanks for attention guys! 🙏🏼<//text>< GmapID>

<review>I came to asked the difference between Note 10 and Note 10 lite. The lady said I dont carry it I dont have the info. She did not take the time to investigate. This is so upset that an Tmobile employee does not have or investigate the info.

Sintiya and the staff at this sprint location was AMAZING! She was so helpful and patient when my dad and I were asking multiple questions about upgrading our phones. She hooked it up and went above and beyond with service. If I have any questions or problems I will definitely be going back to her. My dad and I left as very happy customers!! Thank you!< /text>

LAX location is great. I tried to upgrade my phone at the Overland location and they made a complete mess of the situation. Ultimately, the Overland location sent me to the LAX location, and LAX cleaned up Overland's mess and upgraded my phone. LAX is way better than the Overland location.< /Text>

I AM SO DISTURBED AFTER MY EXPERIENCE IN THIS STORE. I WALK IN AND AFTER WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO TALK TO ME, THE GUY WALKS OVER AND INSIST THAT I WAS IN THE STORE A FEW DAYS AGO. (BACK STORY IM AA). I TELL HIM NO, AND HE AGAIN INSIST THAT I WAS JUST THERE A FEW DAYS AGO, AS IF TO SAY "ALL OF US LOOK ALIKE" ; ( I GO ON TO TELL HIM THAT IM THERE TO SEE HOW MUCH MY DOWN PAYMENT WOULD BE IN ORDER TO OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT. HE THEN COLLECTS ALL OF MY PERSONAL INFO (ID, SOCIAL, ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER) THEN BEFORE EVEN TELLING ME WHAT I QUALIFY FOR LEANS IN CLOSER TO ME THEN I APPRECIATED AND TELLS ME THAT IF I SIGN UP FOR A FAKE BUSINESS LINE I CAN QUALIFY FOR NO DOWN PAYMENT. HE CAN GET ME AMAZON PRIME, HULU, TIDAL, AND THIS LITTLE TRACKER THING FOR MY CAR ALL FOR THE BILL AMOUNT I WANTED. I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT I DID NOT NEED THOSE OTHER SERVICES I JUST WANTED TO SEE ABOUT GETTING A NEW PHONE. HE THEN GOES ON AND ON ABOUT HE CAN MAKE ME A FAKE BUSINESS FOR ME AND WE CAN SAY THAT IM THE OWNER OF WHAT EVER COMPANY. I ASKED HIM IS THIS EVEN LEGEAL LIKE IM NOT INTO FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES HE TELLS ME THAT HIS MANAGER TELLS HIM TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME IN ORDER TO BRING IN EXTRA MONEY ON THE SIDE CAUSE THEY COMMISSION OFF OF EACH SALE. I POLITELY EXCUSED MYSELF AND WALKED OUT THE STORE. I WAS SUPER CREEPED OUT AND COULDN'T BELIEVE THE LAST 25 MINUTES JUST HAPPENED. I CALLED CORPORATE TO LEAVE A COMPLAINT REGARDING THIS STORE AND THEY DISMISSED IT AS IF THIS ISSUE WAS NOT ENOUGH TO LOOK INTO. THEN SHE WENT ON TO ASK ME FOR MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AGAIN AFTER I ALREADY GAVE IT TO THE WEIRDO IN THE ACTUAL STORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED SPRINT. THAT LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNBELIEVABLE. I WILL NEVER TRUST THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN. AND YOUR COMPANY WONDERS WHY PEOPLE DUMP AND YOU AND GO TO T-MOBILE OR VERIZON!!!! : (<//Review>< time>

<text>Don't trust what they tell you at this store. We bought 4 iPhone XRs before we headed out on vacation.  We're were repeatedly told by the manager and employee helping us (with multiple witnesses) that the phones would be $15/month AND buy one get one free ($30 total per month for 4 phones). We asked to see something on writing and were told it would be reflected in an email from Sprint.  We finally got the email from Sprint a few days later and the deal we were promised wasn't there. In other words, they lied to us just to get us to buy the phones.  I called Sprint which was a complete waste of time.  They said I had to work it out with the store that we bought the phones from. I called the store and talked to the manager and he changed his story and lied and denied that he and his employee described the deal as they did.  The moral of this story is don't make the same mistake we made and shop here.</text><date>1561139985559</date>< response>

I have been to Sprint Stores from the West Coast to the East, Midwest to the South since I travel for a living & Nester & his crew (Keevan especially) are by far the BEST when it comes to friendliness & helpful. Even if it’s a drive or a little out of the way for you I’d highly recommend it. No hassles here and guaranteed to be a pleasant experience</Text>

So this store saved my life...and wallet lol !! But seriously they are very helpful ! Let me tell you why! I did an update early Thursday morning and then my network service was done ! It kept going out saying how it was unable to connect to a network, and when it did it was only 3G and lasted for only about 5 min. So after restarting and powering it down and doing airplane mode and that not working I called the Tech support and after they tried to remotely take over my phone and that didn't work, I went this store and he fixed my I've I'm 2 seconds! Very helpful, insightful and fast! I defintely recommend !!</text>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Devante T. added Sprint Complete - protection for smartphone  -  includes insurance and Safe&Found Paying Subscription without my acknowledgment. Today I spent 45 minutes on the phone with Sprint to get my billing readjusted. This is how T-Mobile differentiates itself from its competitors. The Sprint network is far inferior to those of its three major competitors. If the T-Mobile deal fails to win regulatory approval, Sprint is in deep trouble.</text><userid>113422734196515658475<//userid><name>Andrew McVay<//name><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2b1ea19f8dd67:0xeee9c3e037e4ea66</gmap_id>< Time>

I went to the sprint store on 8808 Sepulveda to get an upgrade and buy some accessories. The service was phenomenal. I was helped by a rep named George, he was very professional, very knowledgeable, and help me tremendously. I will definitely be going back for future services and needs<//text>

I only go to this sprint store in 8808 s sepulveda blvd Los Angeles ca, 90045 because I've been to other stores and they all suck. However this store help all customers and are professional doing their job. Joseph mabutol helped me a few times and fix whatever problem I am having. Very knowledgeable. I always tell them before I leave the store that I am very satisfied and won't go to any other store. Highly recommend this store.< /Review>

<Review>I am a resistant parent who's been teaching my two boys how to be practical and not follow any new tech trend that crosses their way. We've had a family plan with Sprint for five years that did not include any data, only text and phone calls. We had made attempts before to switch to a new plan and enter the 21st Century only to leave after two hours frustrated and overwhelmed by all the choices and commitments. On August 18th we marched again into the Sprint store located on 8808 Sepulveda Blvd. in Westchester. I had made up my mind about how much I wanted to spend monthly on four phones. We were met by a new employee named Denea. She was knowledgeable, attentive, funny and efficient! We joked around about my strict manner toward my children and all the retrograde adjectives they used to describe my reluctance to enter the technological world. She was patient with my questions and I never felt rushed. She is a fine example of how a person who deals with the public should behave. We just loved her! I am happy to say that we finally signed up for Smart Phones even though they had to pry my flip phone out of my frantic gripping hands! Thanks Denea, you rock!</Review>< pics>

The manager convinced me that my phone was too old that is was time to upgrade, and if I do I will be paying less. Big mistake I was paying $300now my bill is $1,000.00 and wen I try to get some answers all they said is sorry but you need to pay for activation and first and last month I got home phone that I don't need, cuz I always on the road and a tablet for the internet in case the internet from my phone doesn't work. I'm so furious frustrated and I know they took advantage of me for been so naive. And then they finish the phone call with thankyou for been a nice customer. I do want to terminate my services with them, but now I have to wait two more year's cuz I have a new contract that I never see it. Iwish I could give them minus 10 stars that's what they deserve. Please don't even walk in front of that store.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I have been watching this business explode exponentially because of the exceptional service provided not only by the staff but especially by nurse Shawnda. I am a trans female that needed more enhancement for my femininity.  Shawnda detailed the pros and cons of the dermal filler‘s I was about to get. She administered these fillers gracefully and almost pain-free. So far, and it’s only been a few days, I’ve been ecstatic with the results! This business can perform a variety of cosmetic procedures to make a more beautiful you.  Highly recommended!!!< /text>

<Text>LOVE THIS GEM!!! 💎 As soon as you walk in, super inviting! Such a great feeling when people have such great attitudes! I got teeth whitening, henna brows, and laser hair removal 🙊 the gals there work so well together which made for such great results on everything! So far all the people I've recommended have loved their services too. This review is for me AND my mom but she doesn't have an email lol 😁 she only speaks Spanish and was so comfortable with the ladies there that serviced her in Spanish! So if you made my little mama feel special on top of great service, results, and attitudes? You get these 5 stars fair & square ladies!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Keep up the great work, the feeling you give us of confidence is immeasurable! 🙏💞👄🙌👠👑</Text></record></dataset><record>

100% recommend the signature facial by Sylvia! I suffer from super dry acne prone skin and this facial saved me. Immediately after the facial I had supple hydrated skin and cleared pores. Sylvia knew I was worried about my first time getting a peel. She made sure I was aware of what was happening the whole time. Everyone I met there was kind and knowledgeable. Treat yourself girl! I approve. Thanks girls!< /Text>

Awesome experience! Champagne! Amazing and knowledgeable staff. Nurse Shawnda made me feel comfortable answered all my questions. I had laser hair removal and have already seen great results, I only have a few more sessions left. I've also had a hydra facial with the brightening booster to help with my hyperpigmentation. Very relaxing luxurious experience. First place like this in north county, cant wait for my next treatment.</text>

Shawnda and the staff at Beauty Lounge are FABULOUS!!! Very personable and knowledgeable.

I recently had the Tear trough filler done. I could see results instantaneously.  Tear trough helped plump up an area that became damaged from a previous injection(different provider). Helped minimize the dark under eye circles.  I had tons of complaints about looking more rested, vibrant.

Yes, I did end up with a couple small bruises, easily covered with cover up.  Overall am absolutely happy with the fillers!! I look forward to having many more services with Beauty Lounge!!< /Review>

WOW! I seriously cannot put words to how much I love this med spa! Beauty Lounge babes took care of me so well and made me look and feel beautiful. I had a terrible double chin so I got the Diamond Polar Facial tightening done. In just a few session my double chin was bye bye. I will def be going back soon for more treatments.</Review>

I had powder fill microblading on my eyebrows and I absolutely LOVE THEM!! The shape is perfect and the color is a perfect match. These ladies know what they are doing and I felt confident knowing I was in good hands. I highly recommend for any treatment and I will be back for more!<//review>

I went into the beauty lounge for an IPL photofacial to treat some existing scarring on my face. The service was amazing and Nurse Shawnda was awesome at educating me through the process so I’d know what to expect. My skin 1 week post treatment is visibly more even in tone and texture and most of my scarring has faded if not gone completely away. Will definitely be back!</Review>

This place is outstanding! Shawnda, the owner really knows what she is doing and pays attention to detail. She really listen to my concerns and my expectations and would explain the procedure and what I should expect. I love the fact that not only is she knowledgeable about permanent makeup but that she is a registered nurse herself preforming the procedures. I cannot wait to go back to her for my future permanent makeup needs.< /text>

Beauty Lounge provided a private and comforting room for the facial. The ambiance was really relaxing. She walked me through the process before even starting, so I knew exactly what to expect. She also explained what she was doing while she was doing it. And girl! did it feel amazing!? Heck yah!! My skin felt like it had been touched by an angel for days after!

<name>ashley rene</name><Time>1549749666865<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>This place is truly a gem in Southern California. I had three services done- a henna brow, lash lift, and lip flip. All three came out flawless. The lash lift with Sylvia has been a game changer for me, taking out lots of makeup time during the day and they have grown at a faster rate than I’ve ever noticed before, much better investment than classic eyelash extensions.   My brows are another area I’m skeptical to let people touch, and I was not disappointed - the henna brow lasted 2 weeks, that’s two weeks of not having to touch my brows without committing to anything permanent, trust me you need to try! The lip flip by Shawnda was also a perfect alternative to me not being ready for filler yet, but to enhance my natural upper lip pout giving it more fullness and volume. I learned so much from this place apart from any other med spa, and I love that there are services for every step on the way.From the moment you walk in you feel like you are a million bucks just by the elegance of the place before the staff even works their magic. I enjoyed this experience, the professional staff, relaxing environment and most importantly was so pleased with my results! Amazing prices for luxury service, I wouldn’t trust any other med spa with my face after going to Beauty Lounge!! 💫< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

100% would recommend Beauty Lounge San Marcos for microblading! I absolutely love my new brows! I was super nervous going in but Nurse Shawnda made me feel so comfortable and answered all my questions. She worked to get the perfect shape and color for a perfect subtle brow. I definitely will be back!< /Text>

This place is amazing!  I went in for the Henna brow yesterday. I explained to Viki exactly how I wanted my eyebrows to look...and she made them come out even better than I could ever have imagined! I really want her to do the microblading permanent eyebrows for me, but I need to get over my fear of it. Viki is amazing and for now, I will stick with the henna brows!< /Review>

Absolutely obsessed with this place. One stop beauty shop. They offer so many different treatments. I’ve now had a PRP/microneedling facial, a hydra facial and tear trough filler. I’ve never had this glowy of skin in my life! You can tell that everyone that works there takes a lot of pride in what they do. The girls go above and beyond for their clients. They’re also super fun to chat with! I’d absolutely recommend this place to all my friends! I’m excited to continue getting treatments. It’s nice to have finally found a place I can trust for all my beauty needs. ❤️</Review>

I recently moved here from L.A. and I needed a new go-to gal for all of my beauty needs. I found Shawnda and the Beauty Lounge through a recommendation from a friend. Her Botox prices are so competitive, and it is the best deal I have found in San Diego. Not only that, she was so good at doing it, it didn't hurt and I found that it lasted longer than it usually does. I will be going back to her and would absolutely recommended her to anyone reading this debating if they should go or not!</Text>

Hey friends!
I just wanted to share with you my journey today with Dr. Shawna!
@beautyloungesanmarcos
She is kind, friendly, understanding, and her stories are so relatable and funny. I instantly felt comfortable!
The procedure that she helped me with today was Laser Hair Removal on the arms pits.
She explained everything and made sure I knew what she was doing and the meaning and differences of each brand/products. Everything was smooth and painless! Thank you so much!!
She’s also really pretty. 😍

< Review>
My very first visit was for a Botox update on forehead, eyes and bunny lines. I absolutely loved Shawnda. She explained the procedure and discussed all of the expectations for during and post procedure. It did not hurt at all and I had no bruising which is usually never the case for me.

I later decided to have my tear troughs filled. I have had the procedure done twice before - first time with a VERY famous Beverly Hills doctor that is known for his lip work on a VERY famous cosmetics company owner who is known specifically for her lips. The last time I had this done I had to return for several follow up visits because if you don't know your eye area is very thin and deciding to have this procedure I hope you will do your homework and not expect a one visit miracle. Due to the fact that you are working in such a delicate area, it may take several visits to get the balance you need between eyes and cheek. Luckily, I only required the one visit. I was impressed once again that I had almost no bruising and loved my results with just the first visit.

Next up, I signed up for the Hydra facials. Love love love love love. Do yourself a favor and just get it done as a treat to yourself. You can never have enough hydration living in San Diego! My Esthetician for the facials was an absolute pleasure to visit with and also was so in depth about the procedure and expectations. I will be doing this again and again.

Most recently, I am having the Diamond Polar treatment on my neck for sagging jowls and what looks like a gobble gobble, loose skin. I hate it. I signed up for ten sessions and currently half way through my treatment. I absolutely love the way the treatment feels on my skin each week. It is so relaxing and to be honest...I would pay just to go spend that time with Marissa. If you have not met her yet  - you are truly missing out. She is beyond precious and THE MOST CARING EVER. Love love love her! I really can't post just yet about my final results but I will once I am done. I have already noticed some firming up but I also feel like I am a realist in knowing I still might need some Kybella also.

I would like to just give a great big shout out to Linda who has patiently put up with me having to reschedule and schedule last minute appointments. She is always such a sweetheart on the phone and via emails. I so appreciate that I can just email, text or call and boom they are always responsive to get me in as soon as possible when I have a need.

I want to urge all of you out there to please understand just how lucky you are to have such a talented, caring team here in San Marcos/North County. I have had soooo many cosmetic surgeries and procedures in the past - all over the country. I could do just about anywhere and willing to pay any price (and have) but I love the way these girls make me feel. I know them, I know there struggles and how absolutely hard they work. I have followed them on social media since my very first visit. They are real people and even in San Marcos, they make me feel like I am back in my small town Texas!

Through out my year as a client, I have witnessed all to often others taking extreme advantage of these sweet girls. From flat out theft, to scamming services and not paying and then the overall customers no showing appointments. My mom was a hairdresser growing up so I know the importance of schedules and not being a jerk to others. Everyone of these girls have families...I beg you...please keep your appointments with them! They are busy and they make a choice to take time to help make us all feel better about our looks. The least we can do is be KIND and THOUGHTFUL when booking their time.

Lastly, Shawnda is very talented and I absolutely trust her completely at this point. She is very professional and works so hard to make sure her clients are completely satisfied. Again, I have treated all over the US with full fledged cosmetic surgeons. Be thankful you have these girls locally!</Review>

<Text>Worst experience ever! Went in for henna brow thinking my appointment was going to be with Shawnda after reading so many good reviews. Vicky was the one that did mine. DO NOT GO WITH HER! if you don't want your eyebrow to be ruined! I had people at store said they looked bad. I don't believe she knows what she is doing. My eyebrows were way off. I contacted them but I was blocked! People don't waste your money here. I'm pretty sure there's alot other better locations with a good quality of work....<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1545612618815, 'text': 'Hello Amairani\n\nWe spent a great deal of time executing service recovery with you late at night (1030pm!!!) well after business hours. As reflected in the attached photos of our conversation. We offered to reprocess your lashes and reapply a different color henna brow which you refused. Both services were expertly performed with great results as evident in the photos. Our products and employee time were used to provide your treatment and their was no evidence of negligence our fault for your lash lift and brow henna. You simply did not like the final result and choose to take the opinions of a subway employee who makes sandwiches all day in lieu of  your professional brow artsiest. Viki has over 10 years experience in the beauty industry, threading, and with permanent makeup. She is an expert at her craft.\n\nIt is not our business practice to issue refunds for wonderful expertly performed service like you received. We offered a solution you refused and continued to harass and threaten us into the late hours of the night. Hence taking the course of action to ban you from our page.\n\nAdditionally, as you could see at our location we are full service medical spa and not a one woman show. It is a bit presumptuous to assume that our Registered Nurse Shawnda would be performing your brow henna. She is the Lead Practitioner/Registered Nurse and lead Cosmetic Tattooist as well as the business owner and soley performs medical procedures and permanent makeup.\n\nWe stand by our work and still invite you in to reprocess your lashes and try a different brow henna color. Despite the already completed wonderful work and threats and harassment.\n\nTeam Beauty Lounge\n\nPHOTOS AVAILABLE IN OUR PHOTOS SECTION OF OUR INTERACTIONS, CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CLIENT AS WELL AS COMPLIMENTS RECEIVED ON IG ABOUT HER BROWS!'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>My dermaplaning facial everything and more! It was my first visit and the staff was very welcoming and friendly. They got me checked in and set up within 5 minutes. During my facial my esthetician explained the whole process and educated me on every part of it. My skin came out glowing and so soft! I can’t wait for my next service!< /review>< pics>

Had a hydrafacial done by Katie and Fillers done by Shaunda. The facial left my skin smooth and glowing, very relaxing atmosphere. I got fillers done on my chin and nose and I absolutely love the results! Wasn’t too painful and Shaunda made me feel very comfortable. I definitely recommend this place.</Text>

I went in today for teeth whitening and I didnt have much expectations really that my teeth would get whiter I've been brushing them forever trying to make them white and I havent gotten to the results that I got today at the beauty lounge. The staff were very friendly women, it's like they've known you forever they're so easy to get comfy with! We were so shocked to see how well my teeth had taken to the whitening!!!! I was lucky enough to have such amazing results!! Results were so good my husband couldn't believe it and had to schedule himself a session too lol. I'm in love with the results and I cant wait to come again to get them even more whiter! So pleased with my experience here, I highly recommend Beauty Lounge!!! Thank you staff at Beauty Lounge!!!</text>

Nurse Shawnda is great! I stopped by to get fillers, one syringe of Voluma. We used half on my upper lip and the other half on my chin. She gave me natural and subtle results which is exactly what I wanted! It’s only been one day and I’m still swollen but so far I couldn’t be happier. The office itself however could use some improvement. There seems to be little communication among staff which led to a lot of misunderstandings and everyone not being on the same page. They’re also in the process of switching operating systems so it made things worse. But things like this will improve with time. Definitely stop in and give them a chance to impress you!

8/23/19 Update:
In response to the reply from business:

I apologize if I came off passive aggressive. That was not my intention at all. I was just trying to leave an honest review- that I found Dr. Shawnda's work to be great, but there were other aspects about the business that made the visit unpleasant. I was not trying to go into too much detail, but now I need to address some of the misunderstandings you brought up in your reply to my review.

1. I never once 'assumed' I would be getting a complimentary service. I only knew the spa was providing comped services because a few of my friends were receiving them. So instead of 'assuming', I decided to "engage" with their account. I directly messaged/ asked the official beautyloungesanmarcos instagram page if they were willing to work out a similar deal with me. (screenshots of conversation attached)
2. If they did not want to comp me anything, that is perfectly fine. I would've understood. They could've said no, but they NEVER once did. So I continue to book an appointment.
3. Whenever I would call in, I would ask for Marissa who I was told was in charge of influencer bookings; even in my voicemails I would say I was calling for Marissa. When I had to reply to Nurse Shawnda via email, I even included a PDF of my Instagram messages just to make sure we were all on the same page before I showed up for my appointment.
3. When I show up, Marissa claims that were was no previous conversation between me and the instagram page and she doesn't know who was on their instagram page talking to me and authorizing the service. I found it odd that the business was not aware of who was talking to me via their instagram- which is what I meant in my initial review that there seemed  to be little communication among staff and no one was on the same page despite me doing my due diligence.
4. I found it all to be very unprofessional that they waited for me to actually show up before they decided to turn me down for the comped service, when they could've turned me down on instagram, on the phone, or even in the emails.
5. However, they did provide a courtesy of offering me a discount on a service (as long as I posted on google review, yelp, social media, etc). I appreciated the offer which is why i still decided to go through with it. Since it was still a service I paid for I felt obigated to write an honest review.
6. Looking back at the messages I can kind of see where the confusion came from. But at the end of the day, if the customer is confused about something, is it completely their fault? I mean they're confused for a  reason- just look at those instagram messages for yourself. Do you agree this was 'clearly a result of the customer's assumption'? Personally I think it is more so the result of the business not being clearer in their responses to the customer.

It is a shame that instead  of using this as a learning  opportunity for the business to have better communication among staff members and to better streamline their influencer booking processes, they took the review personally & tried to fault the customer. Despite this leaving a bad taste in my mouth,I truly hope this business the best.< /Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1566575392007, 'text': 'Hi Melanie thanks for the review and we are so glad you liked the results of your procedure. Yes we are upgrading our booking software and you unintentionally recieved all the consent forms due to a technical programming error in the software we have since remedied. As for the “little communication among staff” that was clearly a result of your assumption you were going to be comp’d as an influencer and you self scheduling an appointment that was not authorized or coordinated with the Spa Director in charge of the influencer program. These agreements are pre-negotiated with certain criterion in place and contracts written, and approved by the owner.\nAs a courtesy to you even though you ASSUMED we would give you complimentary services we offered you a generous discount on product, despite you not fitting the prerequisites of our influencer program, and the fact you had never engaged with our accounts let alone follow us on any of our platforms. It’s a shame that you felt a need to be so passive aggressive in your above statements.'}</Resp>< GmapID>

Wow!! My experience with Shawnda was absolutely amazing. I received a HydraFacial & Laser hair removal. First off I’m such a chicken to pain.  Shawnda could tell i was very nervous about the laser removal. She was extremely patient. She walked me through each step , asked about my concerns and put me at ease.
Her customer service is truly one of a kind!!!
If you're looking for a beauty lounge who is all about their clients this is your place.
I couldn't imagine why I've ever settled for less nor will i ever after my visit!
Believe me, Don't hesitate this is your place!
Thanks so much shawnda! Can’t wait for my next treatment.< /review>

<Review>I'd give this place zero stars if I could.the guy I got to cut my hair didn't really do anything right or of professional quality.after charging me $40 for a beard trim and haircut I'm very dissatisfied and I'm just gonna buzz my hair off. Can't recommend this place. I can't only recommend to look elsewhere if you need a barbershop< /Review>< GmapID>

Tiny (2-chair) local place with a cool vibe and friendly stylists who do a good job. They play good music, too. I plan to become a regular.< /text>

Sue has always been great in getting my haircuts just the way I want them. She’s highly recommended from me: picky in the slightest bit. I’m glad I met her and have enjoyed every visit!</review>

I get my haircut every 1.5 - 2 weeks. I've been going to Van for the past few months. He does a decent job, the cost ($16) and location were very convenient.

I went in today for a haircut and when it was time to pay I was informed that the owner, Harvey, had increased the price of a fade from $16 to $23! Not only was I not informed of this prior to getting my hair cut, but that's over a 43% increase for the same service I've been getting! Meanwhile, the gentleman in the chair next to me had a "precision cut" and was only charge $16!

This will absolutely be the last time that I return to Top Cut.</review>

This place is a Gem.  I bring my two grandsons weekly to biweekly. Small and cozy,  not crowed.  They're  Asian, Van the Fade/Taper Expert is Awesome!  I give it 4 stars only because parking sucks in the area,  Killer Kaiser is across the street.</Review>

When a client comes to top cut barber salon I try to find out how they want their hair cut. my focus is to give them the best hair cut they ever had. I have been to Vidal Sasoons hair styling academy in San Francisco. Then I won 1st place in the California state championship for men and women. Then I trained under Paul Mitchel in Hawaii. You can get a grate haircut at Top Cut Barber Salon.< /Text>

Awesome place. Had two cuts with Van and Sue, and you can't go wrong with either one. $20 for the cut plus tip and you're in and out in 30 minutes. I usually like to call ahead and make a reservation but it's not needed.<//review>

<Text>I love going to Top Cut Barber Salon to see Sue.  She's got a great personality and she really takes the time and effort to get your hair looking the way you want.  I've gotten 4 hair cuts from her now and every one has been great.  Make sure to ask for Sue!</Text>< Pics>

<review>I'm so furious with the guy with the purple hair (Marty). I asked for a clean up, just the ends. I warned him about cutting too much shorter because I need to grow the hair out in order to weigh down the curls and he took that as an invitation to remove the curls, which was 1 1/2 inches of hair! Partway through I haveb to interrupt him to tell him to stop--he was taking too much hair, but by that point it couldn't be fixed. I was so uncomfortable and wanted to leave right then and there and just pay for someone else to fix the damage. I told him I came in for half an inch, And he said, "why didn't you tell me"? Because "ends" are like 1/4 inch! I expect a professional to not take such liberty. So upsetting.</review>< Pictures>

Spent one and a half hour in the chair for a short layered cut. The guy with the lavender hair didn't properly put the cover over me, cause it kept slipping off  and by the time he was done, there was hair all over my white blouse. Will NOT be going back.<//review>

I don't want to hurt their rating too bad, but I showed up at a little before 6pm and the door was locked, despite several signs that indicated that they should be open until 7. I had even called beforehand, and listened to their automated message telling me their hours.

To make it even more frustrating, there was a woman inside who completely ignored me. I pulled on the door, went and double checked the sign, pulled on the door again and gave a little knock, but she didn't even look up from her phone.

Not a great experience. I'm from out of town, so I won't be stopping back to see how well they cut hair, when they are open. I took my business a block up the street to "bettercuts", where they actually stay open until the posted time.< /review>

I'm a regular. Super decent and pleasant folks, the wait isn't bad, the price can't be beat, and the buzz cut is the same one you'll get for three times the price elsewhere.<//Text>

<Review>I got a head and face razor shave and it was a great price but the barber didn't have as much attention to detail as I would have preferred. I was also cut more often than ever before.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80857df8383b2811:0x3c8c1c57dd25bd4e< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Worst haircut ever. She rushed it and butchered off all my hair. I explicitly told her not to touch the front and she scissors it all off and exposes all of my forehead. The sides are all wrong and aren't even symmetrical on either side.< /Text>< Pictures>

Today was my first time leveraging their services. My car was QUITE dirty, with a good coating of ash all the way around and dried bird poop on the hood.

Overall, they did a great job considering it was cleaned in just under 15 minutes. I docked a star because you could still see remnants of the bird poop on the hood after their cleaning. But for a 15-ish minute cleaning it all came together very nicely.

Very friendly crew, fast turnaround, and hand-washed. I imagine that a cleaner car would've come out immaculate. I'll be back, hopefully with a car that isn't sporting a decent coating of ash and poop.</text>

Currently only doing exterior washes, they do them so gently and thoroughly that they are worth going out of my way for.<//text>

INSPECT YOUR CAR BEFORE AND AFTER THE WASH, THEY RUINED MY BRAND NEW VEHICLE.

I went in today to wash my brand new vehicle I purchased two weeks ago.
I bought a black toyota corolla LE , BRAND NEW.

Today was the first Time i have ever washed my car at all. And i chose to go there. The men washed the vehicle and I suspected nothing until after it was all done.

I checked my car to find that the whole entire car was scratched up. Very light scratches on the paint  throughout the entire car. It’s disappointing. No we did not get a refund for the $30 and the owner said nothing could be done for us.

They insisted that we bought a scratched up vehicle from the dealers.
Who buys a brand new scratched up car?

Then they decide to bring up that my door is dented on the side. Someone in a parking lot opened the door next to mine and it left a dent last week, it has nothing to do with the scratches left on my car today which correlate with the streak patterns of wiping/ washing that were left on the vehicle.

Truly sad, unbelievable service, no sympathy. No empathy.

I have a video of everything that was said, done and told.

Still don’t understand how they will tell ME that I bought a scratched car. Ridiculous. I have eyes.

And so do they, since one of the guys says there are no scratches but then again says there are scratches and to go to our insurance since they wont do anything to help us.

I hope you all please find yourself a different car wash, because they will not take accountability for what they do and tell you otherwise.

If I could just post a video on here for you all to see the guy telling us that we bought a scratched (all over) brand  new car.

No one god damn buys a brand new car with scratches everywhere.

My odometer reading is 40 miles. Brand new car.

Let me also add that the car is only 60% clean after the wash
The front two windows, still dirty and soapy, and all the crevices are dirty.
Im literally so confused on how they still are doing business.< /Text>

My first time coming here and chose the works $45... My car needed it. Very smooth process overall. I was a little confused on where to enter. They're pretty speedy and my car has a nice glow again.</review>

Around $24/$25 for hand wash and dry, exterior only. Fast and professional. Someone greats you as you pull up, explains what you'll get, the price and what to do next. Good customer service.  Note: payment by card only the day I was there.</Text>

I recently had my car detailed here on a busy weekend. They work on plenty of high end cars from BMW M's to Ferrari's and mine was not n exceptional either. They did a fabulous job, work was done with high professionalism and great attention to detail. I will always take my cars to this place and recommend them highly!!<//text>

<Text>Please tip the poor souls who are still working here.

Sadly, the most accessible, centrally located car wash that employed a score of hard working, diligent people is destined to be closed.

Apparently the land owners are turning the property into yet another luxury apartment building.

This city is losing all utility and is becoming a never ending landscape of apartment/condo buildings and restaurants.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

This place is terrible, stay far away.  The drainage doesn't work, so you have to walk through a pond as you're cleaning the car.  It's a very dirty place<//Text>

You used to be able to select from 3 different car washes and they would do a pretty good job cleaning the inside and outside. Now since very recently they charge $25 for just the outside cleaning. Seems kinda strange for a place that was jam packed all the time. And in any case $25 for just the outside is a rip off, plenty of other places like Tower Car Wash that’ll do a better job cleaning your car for around $30 all in.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Used to love this place, but as of Jan 2020, they only do exterior washes (no vacuuming, etc) and you no longer get a discount on gas with a wash. The gas and wash are two separate businesses now. It’s bizarre and kind of pointless and I don’t know how they’re going to stay in business with those two changes which were pretty much the only draws.</Review>

<Text>Use to be good. But they don't do the inside anymore and they charge 25$ for outside of the car wash..... waste of money.. I can just got to a gas station wash for 8$ and get the same job. Only came here for the inside and they don't offer it anymore. RIP.<//Text><gmap_id>0x808580af098876a9:0x89f27fb63f8cb747</gmap_id><Name>Michael Pescatore</Name>< Resp>

Went to speak to the manager and he told me to literally go away that it wasn’t his problem. I left the manager’s manager a voicemail and of course never heard back.

Found out numerous other people have also had damage stories from this place due to neglect. Will never go here again and can’t
recommend you do either.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>They charged me $44.95 but did not bother to actually clean the vehicle. Car is almost new...gave them a chance to clean it properly, but they refused and whined, had a million excuses. Basically they are willing to do almost anything besides clean the car. You have been warned.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I came for the first and my experience was the worst I’ve ever had for a car wash place.  The inside of my car was not even vacuumed at all and I had paid for a wax and my rims to be cleaned and that was not done. I paid for a service to be done not for me to end up cleaning my car that defeats the purpose. I will make sure to never come here again and for others as well so they wont be cheated out of their money.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>They couldn't careless about cleaning my car. Did a horrible job. Eventually grabbed a towel and had to finish off their job. Floor mats weren't washed and rims were dirty despite the fact that I purchased  the "ultra" package. Spare you time and go somewhere else... 2 stars just because of the nice staff at the entrance and at the cashier.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808580af098876a9:0x89f27fb63f8cb747<//Gmap_id>< Time>

You can tell a lot by the volume of cars lined up for a wash. Everyone says this is the best car wash in SF. Granted, it is a well oiled machine. Same price as Matt and Jeffs in Novato: $37.<//Text>

One of the few car wash locations in San Francisco. Fast and efficient! On a Saturday morning, I was in and out in about 25 mins, and that was with "The works" service. I also noticed that if you had kids with you, the friendly owner would offer toys or other distractions for the wait, which was a nice touch. Prices are reasonable for the area, so if you're like me and used to go to touchless car washes at gas stations, this is a much better upgrade. I'll definitely be back!< /review>

Good car wash but on the expensive side. Quick and easy. Get gas for a wash discount.<//text>

This place is dropping off a ton. I've been hoping it would get better but it hasn't. The interior specifically. Seats and floors consistently dirty still. Such a bummer. Really love the location.</review>

<text>Unreliable. I am here on a day and time when they are supposed to be open but there is absolutely nobody here and no sign saying whether or not they plan to be here. I wasted a good chunk of my morning on this by getting here a bit early to try to get out early.

This looks like everybody here at this company knew they weren't coming in today but no one bothered putting a sign in the window to tell the whole line of people here waiting what was going on. I'm one of about a dozen people who waited here for nothing.< /text>< Pictures>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Moved to the Bay Area about 9 months ago and had yet to find a convenient way to get my car washed. I found Divisadero Touchless Car Wash on G+ and gave it a shot. Neclair did a great job! He did both the inside and outside of my car. I will continue to use this service. It was reasonable in price especially for the convenience and the quality of the wash. The best part of this company as well is the how they use alternative uses to reduce the amount of water. Great first experience!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

For $50 "The Works" , you get an unfinished carwash inside and out. Quality has declined and I know I won't be returning.
You drive away with suds left on your side mirrors, dripping water from your license plates (front and back), and trunk. The interior was barely wiped clean. I could've gotten an exterior wash and did  the interior myself and that would have been more value for my money.  Based on my previous experience and the reviews, it's a hit and miss. I prefer to go to a place where I can count on good quality service.<//text>

Do not go here!  If you do, pay for LOWEST level service because that's all you are going to get. Paid $42 for wash which included interior vacuum, and wheel rim cleaning. Rims weren't touched and It wasn't vacuumed, at all.  When I approached attendant about this, she had me move car to vacuum station asking me which part of the car I wanted vacuumed.  When I responded "all of it" she acted like I was being unreasonable.   Pope work.  Terrible service.</Review>

<review>Not a place for nit pickers..  Great for average Joe less demanding types.  Car goes in dirty stinking, comes out clean and smelling good.  Good price, $32, way less expensive than Tower.  Perfectionist should go drop 250 on a  detailed who will blow dry your seats after washing.</review><Gmap_id>0x808580af098876a9:0x89f27fb63f8cb747</Gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><user_name>Terry Williamson<//user_name><UserId.>104618406940877595797<//UserId.>< Date>

<Text>Pretty nice touchless car wash option. You hand over your keys and they do the rest. Your car goes through a variety of washing stations. The basic package costs some $30 - they clean the exterior, but also vacuum and wipe the interior. You can wait on one of the benches provided, but the whole process is pretty efficient. My car was not entirely spotless, and I might have hoped for more given the investment, but it was still a decent result.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<review>I used to scoff at paying for something that you could do yourself but really it is worth it to get your car washed here. For $35 you can get the full clean on the car windows interior and wheels. The wait was only about 15 minutes and the quality was pretty good. The friendly staff at the desk check you out and you're set to go again. Overall I'd recommend this location.</review><Date>1468512965109<//Date><Response>None</Response>< Pics>

Paid $54.95 &got about $20.00 of service. I even gave 3 workers a $5.00 tip. The seats and center console didn't get vacuumed and there was still dirt on the roof. Was the worst car wash ever. Worth no more than $20.00 anyone who pays more is a fool. Don't waste your time and money, go somewhere else. There's other places.< /review>

<Text>The basic car wash used to be pretty good, but it's been very disappointing for the past year. Does not matter if they are busy or not, the employees will vacuum and dry with the an embarrassingly lack of attention. The washing part is worse, with my side mirrors still dirty, and mud streaks still on the sides. It feels like I really did not get what I paid for yesterday.< /Text><date>1506885141801</date>< pictures>

Best place for a car wash in SF. Wish it wasn’t so expensive but definitely the place to take your car to look brand new again.<//Text>

They're not great but they're not bad either. I'd ask for the handwash to avoid the machine swirls. I come home and do the detailing after they're done, even after the "works" treatment.<//Review>

<Text>Touchless all right - you'll think no one touched you car once they are done.

Seriously though - they waxed over bird droppings and crap making it harder to remove, and there was smutz all over the inside of the car. Friendly guys, but I'm not going back.</Text>< Pictures>

This place is very overpriced for the quality of service. I've stopped going. Exterior ends up ok while the interior clean up is subpar. Go somewhere else.</Text>

Good overall. Convenient location in the city but much more expensive than South City Car Wash. Driving down to South City isn't always practical so you pay a premium to do it in the city.< /Text>

<review>They did an acceptable job, but it's incredibly expensive.  I think I paid about $30 for a $9 wash.  Go to a gas station wash and deal with the flaws.  This isn't worth the $25 extra bucks.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Considering the critical draught in CA it's pretty bad time to have a carwash operating, you guys should stop the business until things get back to normal. Also having your car clean right now is synonymous of shallowness.< /review>< pics>

If I can do 0 stars I would do 0. On Friday 5/21/2021 my family of 9 went to have dinner here and they gave us 2 tables one table can sit 7 and we added 2 seats more to be all together. The manager CRISTINA Came to tell us this were her words!! You guys can't sit all together there's 2 tables IF YOU GUYS DON'T LIKE IT YOU GUYS CAN LEAVE!!! we understand there's some restrictions due to covid but she does not had to be so rude. Bad experience here we are not coming back that's not how you talk to customer.</review>

Not your Typical Olive Garden! Save your $$ This top sirloin plate cost me $19.29!  Poorly presented, dry steak, wilted broccoli,  and poorly dressed zucchini. Manager was not apologetic and simply said she would change it out. When she had the server bring the plate back, they only changed the plate, gave fresh broccoli and added pasta to my plate (which I didn't want in the first place). Manager didn't even come back to check on us or discount the food and this was all after waiting for a half hour to be seated in the first place.  This manager has no idea what she is doing and running the restaurant into the ground.  Very sad.<//text>

<text>Well, due to the pandemic we had to wait in our vehicles to be seated. They told us an hour but it was more like 20 minutes. Yay! After seated,  out waiter was right there taking our order. The wait time was not long. Food received hot and delicious.  The waiter was very responsive and attentive. Patient with the kids as they ordered and asked for refills. It was my little ones birthday and he more than earned the tip we presented. Everyone was happy.< /text>< userid>

<review>Food was fresh and delicious.  Service was slow even though it wasn't busy yet.  Our server was training someone and not pleasant about it, on a definite power trip.  So while the food was good the atmosphere was tense and not enjoyable.  Still gave 5 stars because of good food and the young women at the front with big smiles and welcoming!</review>< pics>

If I could give a half a star, I would. I ordered sea food Alfredo and it was cold. It taste like it was cook in the morning and they just slapped it on the plate. My friend ordered shrimp pasta with a wine sauce on the side, her pasta was dry and shrimp was cold and uncooked, the sauce was so salty that she couldn't even eat it.. the only food that was good was the calamari. DO BETTER OLIVE GARDEN!</text>

The quality of the food; Subpar, steaks passed well done when I asked for medium and, the Alfredo was cold and honestly quite dry.
The people were nice and friendly.

Clean location. Friendly, helpful staff, and good food. No. Really. To my surprise the food was very good. I was never a fan of The Olive Garden before, but this location has their stuff in order. Will definitely go again.<//text>

Amazing staff! Amazing food! It's been years since I have eaten at olive garden so it was nice to go back! Was super excited when I saw the zucchini noodles with grilled chicken dish in the menu! Was beginning to think I was going to have to spoil myself on my diet. But thrilled to have seen it on the menu made my visit back even more enjoyable!<//Text>

<review>Surprisingly good especially with the covid restrictions..would seriously advise you to call/order ahead and tip the person coming out in the cold to take care of you a little extra if you can..they really appreciate the kindness<//review></record>

Enjoyed a delightful dinner with my husband in a "safe" (socially distanced) environment where the staff members were attentive, properly wearing masks, kind and efficient.  Olive Garden is predictable. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not. The food is good, the portions more than generous, the surroundings pleasant. It's a standard "go to" place for our family.< /Review>

My server, as well as some assisting servers, was very friendly, very attentive, but not too overbearing. My drinks, appetizers, and food were all brought out expeditiously, but not so soon that I was unable to finish the previous item. I also noticed that the staff were very thorough with sanitation. Amazing meal, will definitely come back soon!</Review>

Waitress did not do her job. We are a repeat cust. Customary to serve bread stick along with glass of water before placing order. She served people first that were seated 10 minutes after us maybe because her same kind. Did not really enjoy our time. Still we left a tip but after looking back we should have not left any. We asked for their wine sample and she never
brought out any. Did not eat any main dish after much have no appetite.</review>

Our server Joe was very good. She made sure we were taken care of in a timely manner and made sure we had everything we needed. The salad was fresh and the soup was very good...not to mention the breadsticks... Yum yum 😋! Very happy with our meal and the service.</review>

Great place for pasta. Got the Alfredo Fettucine and it was really good. Highlights for the mushroom creamy pasta on the Classic's Menu. Tasty bread sticks!<//Review>

The last time I tried to order from this place they shut down before their listed closing hour and they've cut their menu so much that they only had one item on it that interested me, this in addition to the change they made to the salad does not encourage me to go back there.< /Review>

Not really a fan but my girlfriend loves this place. They have a few dishes I enjoy. Been wanting to try one of their breadstick sandwiches for quite some time. Unfortunately they are only available during lunch. Finally got to try one and they forgot my cheese. There's only 4 ingredients to this sandwich and they only made it to 3. So I'll forget to give them a couple of stars.</text>

Ordering take out from here for the first time, wasnt sure what to expect. I am happy/pleased to say it was our best choice. The portions were very generous, very tasty and fresh! The Moscato wine, by recommendation, was the cherry on top! Can't wait to go back! Thank you Olive Garden! All take care and stay well!

Wow! So much more than just pasta!! Everything was delicious and the service was the BEST!!! Be aware, there's a "wait list" option online, but the timing was not accurate.  The whole 45 minute drive there, it claimed no wait time (yes, I refreshed my screen each time I checked the status), but once we walked in the door - 10 minute wait for a table. Maybe not crucial to some, but we needed to squeeze a birthday dinner in prior to working the night shift so it was important to us.</Text>

The service was bad in my opinion. The food had a different taste to it. My husband ordered the lasagna and said that it tasted funny. He only ate about half of it and didn't want anymore because of how it tasted. My fedaccini tasted different, like a strange taste at the end of a bite. My lemon cake was really good. When the waitress boxed up our leftover food, I asked for the salad also. So she boxed the two bowls of salad together, the only problem was that their were two different dressings in the two bowls of salad. Bottom line is that I've had better tasting food and service than I did tonight!< /Text>

The Olive Garden was a lovely experience. Howe er, it was more expensive than I had expected. $70 for two people before the tip. But the foodbwas very good and I did order seafood and a medium sized order of house wine. Very tasty nonetheless.< /text>

Tonight was not busy so food was very fast. Our server was very attentive and our never ending pasta bowls were very tasty. Salad was crisp and fresh and bread was hot. A very pleasant experience.<//review>

<Text>I really wish Olive Garden would bring back some of the more classic dishes. Some of the newer dishes make it hard to have a cohesive meal. Overall cleanliness was an issue, our server however was really polite and very attentive.<//Text>< Pics>

Vallejo store has stepped their game up. Usually don't care for Olive Garden in Vallejo but today's lunch was the best I've had at this location. 45-minute wait for to go order and restaurant was constantly full while I was there. Must be a good sign it may be time for a dinner date Olive Garden Vallejo. Glad to see them doing well< /text>

<Text>Wait staff was nice but the food was terrible.  Meat sauce was bland and the lettuce was wilted in my salad. The saving grace was the Zuppa Toscana was tasty even though it was over cooked. I sent back the spaghetti and meat sauce and was given fettuccine alfredo which was good.< /Text><Rating>2</Rating>< name>

We visited this store 6/2/19 around 6pm. To be honest, our server was tweaking out on something. It was very uncomfortable. He gradually got better but this olive garden needs to be looking at their servers while working, because this was not exceptable. We waited 15 min after ordering to get our drinks. When my soup came it literally had 5  small pasta shells (we counted), a few large tomatoes, and a ton of spinach. We waited for an exceedingly long amount of time to even see the server again so we just shared the salad. The meal was very good. That's all I can think positive to say. He never returned and we left without getting any boxes using the card reader at the table. Please look into this.

Went for my daughter in laws birthday. They were out of her entree and dessert she wanted.  The wait staff was slow.  Over 15 minutes before we got our salad and soup.   Never offered or received any refills on our drinks. The waitress was very friendly just not attentive.< /text>

We made reservation online @ 6:20pm and confirmed estimate wait time 6 to 10 minutes. When we arrived the restaurant  @ 6:40pm, the receptionist said we need to wait 20 more minutes.  Talked to the receptionist again @ 7:00 pm, we were told that the online reservation system is not compatible.  Talked to the receptionist @ 7:25pm again, receptionist walked away without saying a word.  Then she came back said follow me and seated us down in a table.  The waitress was very nice and professional and the foods were great and the price was good.< /text>

The customer service is ok, but the food is average, at best. I got a to go order and the food was something that would come out of a mac & cheese box or something - bland, cold and stiff. I only rated 3 stars because they were very polite to my father, but in reality the food isn't very good at all. So pricey for average, or below average, food. I wouldn't waste money here so good thing I spent a gift card that was given to me.</Text>

It's Olive Garden, so you get the usual fine Italian fare. Unfortunately, a few hiccups made for a substandard experience. Our server was very nice, but a few communication miscues somewhere along the line led to mixed up orders and dropped soup and bread stick refills (which was more of a problem since some in our party ordered the soup, salad, and bread sticks meal). At least one meal was only warm at best, though mine was hot. Ultimately not a great experience.< /Text>

<Review>Awesome food and portions!

Service strangely was TOO attentive. Somehow we ended up with two people attending to our table, and every 3 minutes someone was walking by and asking us how things were. It really made having a conversation very difficult. Attentive service is very important to me, but in this case it was way over the top.

Then, our main server was hovering over us when the bill came waiting for the receipt to be signed. REALLY?! We did ask her to come back, but then she wanted her pen back before she left. A few minutes later I went to the hostess and asked if I could borrow a pen, and she let me have one, but strangely she followed me halfway to the table. If there is such paranoia about letting a pen out of your sight, then management is doing a poor job of supplying basic necessities to their staff, which unfortunately has the result of making guests uncomfortable.< /Review>< pics>

My dinner was not the best.  Everyone else's in my party, was very good. Next time I'll know not to order the chicken parmesan,  lasagna,  and fettuccine.  The fettuccine was very good though.  Service was excellent.  Very nice staff.<//Review>

I’ve been to the San Francisco location and other locations and never have I had such a bad experience at Olive Garden.

<review>This restaurant has a bad history with customer service. I have not had a good experience with them in years. Even on to-go orders they tend to make “mistakes”. Today I ordered a Sicilian Cheesecake with strawberries to go. I get home and they forget to put the strawberries.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1594655866131, 'text': 'alejandro,   We never want to let our guests down but it sounds like we missed the mark.

I used the online ordering and picked up my food for a lunch break. Andrea was AWESOME. Super nice and accommodating while I waited. She made sure my order was on point and even hooked me up with a few extras when my wait took a bit longer. Thanks again girl !</text>

<text>Went there for lunch to celebrate a cousin's birthday and at the same time to catch up with another cousin who I haven't seen in years. We had starters of calamari, meatballs and something else. We had for our mains - chicken masala, fettuccine, soup and salad. Food were of good quality and service was fantastic. The girl who served us was very friendly and was very knowledgeable of the menu. Will definitely go back there.</text><GmapID>0x808572d4362013df:0x41160b5efb0268e9</GmapID>< pics>

The wait is long, no reservations accepted. The Mediterranean Scampi was horrible. Pasta was like soggy top ramen noodles. My daughter couldn't even eat her pasta in marinara because the pasta was over cooked. The service there was nice. However for the price we paid it wasn't worth it.</text>

<text>We frequent this restaurant and had decent service over the years, sometimes excellent service. We've decided to come here an hr before closing and will never again go this late.

When we arrived, it was a 30 min wait, which was fine. We ideally wanted to go in the Cafe, but none of the tables were bussed. After a while of waiting, the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit in the Cafe which was still not bussed. It was eventually cleaned off and we sat down.

We had no silverware, the waiter was slow, got our soup/salad before the drinks. The employees were complaining about not being able to go home on time. Our waiter was asked to clock out, but he told her that he wasn't going to leave without getting his tips. I understand that it's a Sunday and it was a busy day, but I've never been in a restaurant with all this nonsense. The food was the best it's ever been. Just don't show up here an hr before closing. You'll have the worst service imaginable.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1529942481505, 'text': "Alvaro Guevara, we're sorry for letting you down and hope to learn more about your visit to see how can improve.

I love Olive Garden. My girlfriend and O have started to come here often; not just for the food, but for the amazing service we receive. Brian J. in particular is amazing. Great service, such a gentleman. He is willing to accommodate to your needs and he gave us plenty of time to look at our menus to decide what we wanted to drink as well as what we wanted for our meals. Once we were getting ready to leave, Brian offered to give us a salad and breadsticks to go, something other servers wouldn’t usually offer. Brian J. Is amazing and I highly recommend anyone who goes to this Olive Garden to be served by him. You will not be disappointed.</text>

<Review>Olive Garden is a great Italian restaurant that offers a wide variety of Italian style foods at reasonable prices. They usually offer a deal for seniors at certain times and days that makes it worth going. Their breadsticks are great. The restaurant is clean and the staff are usually courteous. The restaurant is often busy at meal times so plan accordingly. They have a free parking lot with a few handicapped spots.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Judged us based off our looks and left us alone to fend for ourselves in the handicapped  section. We were a family of 6 with a child in wheelchair.  We spent 170 and tipped 35% just to show her that despite how we look our race..we are not judging her she shouldn't  us</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I used to take my family to your restaurant years ago when salads were plentiful, portions were over the top delicious. Times have changed. Skimpy portions. Especially the eat one in, take one home. No options for modification to any take home item.
My colleagues did not like being called guests. As one said, "Guests should be eating for free because they are a guest". You wouldn't charge your guests at home for a dinner you prepared. She had a good point. We are still paying customers. Come up with another word, but not guest.
Still like your salad and the women enjoyed their soups.</Text>

<review>Disappointed, trying to place a to-go order with who ever was on shift was painful and of course the order was wrong when we arrived and needed to be corrected at the restaurant. The fettuccine alfredo was 95% pasta 5% sauce so it was basically just pasta. Luckily we had a jar of alfredo sauce at home that salvaged the meal. We had the same problem with the  marinara sauce that was on the spaghetti with chicken parmigiana. I hope tonight's experience was just an off night for everyone involved.< /review><Rating>2< /Rating>< GmapID>

<Review>Well, first things first. We used to love Olive Garden. Sadly, our last few experiences have not been up to par with what we expect. Thing is not just your particular restaurant but ranges all the way from Philadelphia to San Francisco. The quality of the food has finished. The quality of the wines has diminished(Sutter Home????Really). As an example, my wife and I have both, at different times and places, purchased the Asiago Chicken dish that is back on your menu and the chicken was grisly and chewy and well as being a small portion.

Also, the spaghetti sauce is now super sour. It has always been a little sour for my taste but that is acceptable when you have large amount of pasta to go with it (I never purchase the sauce and always go for something Alfredo or otherwise).  I know you would have rather I sent you a private email, but I thought I would share this review.

Aldo, I do appreciate you responding to my negative review, even if it is automated.

P.S.  I still like the soup, salad and breadsticks!< /Review>< pics>

Our recent visit, we had the best service by our waiter "Brian".  We had unlimited breadsticks, soup & salad and the bake salmon was delicious.</review>

Group of 6 arrived at 3:19. Were told 15-20 minutes wait. 4 other groups waiting. 4:30-10 groups have been seated, and we are still waiting. Son fell asleep on the waiting both. No apologies nor acknowledgements from the staff. Seems they’re waiting for us to leave. Such disappointment from such a great place.<//text>

< Review>
I used to love this location, that is until some friends and I went there one night and our waitress just completely blew it. She acted like she was drunk, reeked of alcohol, somehow forgot to input our order but continued to serve people that came after us while telling us she was going to see what was going on with our order. 45 minutes later brings out an order that contained nothing that we had ordered. We finally had given up on her and put an order through the little computer thing at our table. I go to pay through the computer and it says I owe for two orders! One from the previous customers and our order. I ask her to fix it and she takes my card and says she'll take care of it. She ends up charging me for both orders and then refunding it and does it again which locks up my credit card. She tells me were good to go but fails to give me a receipt. As we're walking out  the manager accuses us of trying to leave without paying and the waitress is nowhere to be found. I then get told I have to pay with a different payment method after the manager checks their system and says my payment hadn't gone through. I ended paying cash and by this time I am furious. I get home and realize the desserts we had asked for as to go I had been charged for but never received! I drive back to the location and let them know of their error and the hostess gets our desserts but we received no apology and were basically ignored by both the manager and our worthless waitress. Come to find out the next day the charge HAD gone through on my card and since I had also paid cash that meant I was double charged. It took me 3 weeks to deal with the dispute with my credit card company. Ugh, I haven't been there since due to their stupidity.</Review>

<text>The Vallejo location is great. Famous Olive Garden food with the best service compared to others. Good staff and servers. It's a 30 minute drive for me, while others in the chain are closer, I chose to drive it for great experience.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Me and my parents went there and right off the bat they didn't give my mother her fork for the salad she ordered, so it took us a will to get someone to assist us.  Second I ordered medium rare sirloin with the alfredo and got it completely cooked and dry.  Honestly I get better service at a fast food chain.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>Family members and I needed a nice place to recover from a moment o sadness  and this was the perfect place.  The staff were very attentive and uplifting with their delivery of customer service.  My apologies for not making a mental note of our waitress, but we were a large group of 8 people, to the left in the back by the window around 2:30 on 02/22/2019. The hostess was also very friendly.  Thank you to all of the assistanting staff members.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I see all these bad reviews and I'm wondering what happened? My husband and I decided to have a much needed date night and he surprised me by coming here! I've never been here before and I must say, it was absolutely amazing! We had 2 servers because our original one was on break when we came in, but they where both superb. Our drinks, appetizers, and my alcoholic drink came super fast. Not even 20 min later our main courses where served. I've had several differents kinds of lasagna, one even from a woman who was only visiting the U.S.. This beat all those other ones!! Amazing! You have to try it if you come here. Oh and we came at 5pm on a Friday night.< /Review></record>

I rated it a 3 because at 5pm, we had an hour and half wait. We thought getting there by 5pm we would get seated quickly. We were wrong.
But the Bartender, Sara, was awesome & friendly but slammed.
Our waitress, Fatima, was wonderful.. we had a birthday celebration & she was great, always checking in, got everything right, helped with the cake we got. She knows her stuff.. Thank you Fatima.<//Review>

<review>My family and I just had dinner there. Food was good but service was not. We got our salad but we had no silverware, we asked our waitress and she said ok so after waiting about 10 min. we asked another waitress 5 min. Later both show up with the silverware. We asked about the bread and it took a long time to bring it. Never came back to ask if we wanted another drink.... asked to get boxes and it took more time...my husband left her a tip even though she didn't deserve it.<//review>< resp>

Olive Garden seems to always be a great choice for dinner. There’s plenty of parking at this location and if you get there before 6:30, you’ll likely be seated right away. This was our experience on a Friday night but after 7, expect lots of people waiting. My husband and I ordered a pitcher of their berry sangria and it was a perfect compliment to sharing an appetizer sampler and a tour of Italy (highly recommended). The salad and breadsticks were great as always and our food was delicious. You simply cannot go wrong here with the friendly, family like staff. We’ll be back next time we are craving Italian.</review>

<review>The service was great. However for some reason there was a long wait - there always is. My main complaint was the carbonara sauce - there was practically no sausage or bacon. They need to check the recipe book I'm afraid. They gave me lots of salad and the bread sticks were good. But I was very disappointed by my main dish. Olive Garden is actually expensive - it will be a long time before I return if ever.< /review>< GmapID>

<text>We had a family gathering at Olive Garden in Vallejo and everything was great. There were 10 of us in the party and our server, Fatima, was very attentive,  professional and friendly.  Her hospitality skills help make the night enjoyable.
Before dinner, we all met at the bar for happy hour and the Bartender was great. We had s couple rounds and the service was quick (important when ordering drinks) and very friendly.
While the wait can seem excessive for a table, I recommend hanging out at the bar for conversation and good times until you are seated.
Good experience over all...</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Call in, take out. Our in-laws are not travelling well so for a special dinner we dropped by in the morning and set up a take out order for 5:00 pm. It was ready to go and packaged nicely and on our table warm with soup, salad, and bread sticks.  Some leftovers too when we were done. Who knew? Definitely a repeatable event for us,.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Decided on a whim to go to this location for dinner, on a Wednesday. We had family here whom had been evacuated from Sonoma County, and wanted to have a nice dinner outing. We arrived and were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait, we waited about 10 minutes and were sat down, this had to have been around 10 minutes prior to 6PM or so, we sat, it was a busy night to our surprise but with enough staff, after we all had some time to look at the menu, we started chatting and lost track of time, to our surprise, waiters and staff walked past our table numerous times, our waiter had not came to introduce themselves nor were we brought water or bread, as I looked at the time, it was around 6:27PM, we had sat and waited close to 30 minutes, I got up, went to the hostess and asked when the waiter was going to come by as she had sat us and not a single person came to check on us, she apologized and stated she would check who our waiter assigned was, I went back to our table, waited another few minutes and yet nothing, we started talking and realized no one would come soon to take our order, as we were getting up to leave, a waitress came by and stated she’d check on our drinks, not sure what drinks she’d be referring to as she had never came by nor did anyone else for that matter to take a drink order. This has to be one of the worst experiences at this Olive Garden location. There was enough staff, but on a busy night and every table seemed to be checked on, by bussers & waiters. I’ve worked in this industry and this has to be by far a terrible experience for anyone waiting to have a dinner, especially for evacuees who are looking to have a good dinner experience away from home and not knowing what they will return to. I am disappointed as this had been a regular location of ours and to have had family from out of town have a horrible experience, it’s one to notate not to return to.< /Text>< Time>

<text>Not a local resident from Vallejo but I stopped by here randomly and the outside building is very nice. I was greeted by a gentlemen and he told me to sit at the bar which was fine. I was helped by the bartender really quick.  I got the lunch special Chicken Alfredo and it was delicious! Only think I didnt like was the Passion Fruit drink it was very mineral tasting than fruity taste. Anyhow lunch hour was very casual and quiet. I would definitely come back when in town.< /text>< UserId.>

I've been to plenty of olive gardens. This one is very consistent in their quality of food. Everyone is really nice and excited to make recommendations. The never ending soup and salad combo is my jam! I love the potato gnocchi soup and the pasta ravioli. Also their risotto balls are to die for!!< /text>

Unfortunately our server was very slow. The other server in the cafe was around way more. Our drinks took 25 minutes to come to our table after ordering. The server wasn't even the person who brought out our food. Basically, she took our order and filled our drinks a couple times. That's it.

Also when we were paying at the kiosk on the table, it had trouble processing our gift card so we pressed the button to call the server. Again, it took over 20 minutes for her to come to our table. We told her that it couldn't process our payment and she said oh yea I saw that, it does that sometimes. Ok, so why didn't she come to help us????

We will not be coming back.</review>

Our waiter Chris was very knowledgeable on the menu and specials. The food came quickly and was delicious. I had a bit of a wait to refill my soup and salad. Except for that, we had a wonderful experience. I'll return on a nonevent day to discover if they preform at this level on a consistent basis.< /text>< Pics>

Food was very good, service was not got. Once seated it took a while for the server to get to our table. Once there the server took our order and all was well. Then came the issue with the food, first the main items were brought to the table, after waiting a bit we asked for our soups and they forgot to bring them. Then we asked for ketchup and it never came. At the end we requested boxes for our leftovers and the server just left them on the table but never offered to help.</Text>

Our waiter at the bar was so good friendly and had great conversation. The food was excellent as usual. The wait time was no problem because although it was busy we took the option of sitting at the bar, which was still same great service! First time here just stopping through this city.</text>

Whoever answer the phone on a Monday evening is very rude and unprofessional.  I was craving for pasta but this lady has ruin my Monday night dinner.  Trying to order my food for pick over the phone but the lady is rude and with an attitude and not helpful.  I love Oliver garden but after tonight my whole thing for this restaurant has change.  I will never spend a penny with this restaurant and trust me  none of my family will be going to oliver garden again.  I am a GM in a restaurant and trust me customer satifisation is our priority and they need to train this lady.  This is the location Vallejo , they need better training on their crew members.<//Text>

The food was great and our server was amazing.❤❤ I would have given it 5 stars.. but the parking lot was a bit scary and someone's car got broken into while we were there. 😯 I also noticed lots of broken car glass throughout the lot from previous break-ins. The Restaurant itself was outstanding today.< /text>

We ate dinner at this Olive Garden a few days ago and the place was packed but I don’t know why. The service was absolutely terrible… We waited for 40 minutes and then decided to take a table in the bar area. We had to clean it off ourselves, wipe the table down with the used napkins from the prior people eating there, and then had to go chase someone down just to get menus. We waited another half an hour and finally our waiter showed up to take our order. Then after another long wait we got our Food but then I had to go chase down our waiter again to get silverware. Everyone’s dinner came except one and after a long wait we asked where the food was. I had ordered shrimp scampi and told them to cancel the order but he came out with it and the shrimp were still clear - in other words, half cooked!!  After an hour and a half my daughter-in-law I just paid the bill with the little kiosk sitting on the table. I then called our waiter over to show him my food was half cooked and he was going to remove that from the bill but it was too late because she had already paid. It was the worst experience of our lives.</review>

Normally I am down for soup salad and breadsticks combo—quick and easy. Tonight I got seaweed lettuce and cold soup. The waitress seemed indifferent but got me another bowl of soup. At that point I was not as hungry as I wanted to be then 3 different bugs landed on my seaweed salad. It was that moment when I asked for the check and left. Good luck if you eat here!< /text>

So... Usually, I love Olive Garden. Tonight though was just unbelieveable, after a 25min que for a table for two, I asked for an update and the table had been given away. For dinner we enjoyed an appetizer of calamari without any dipping sauce, mozzarella-less mozzarella sticks. And after opening one of these greesy cheese-less cracker shells for our waitress, she brought us another batch... These being worse than the first.  The food was so bland and the chicken so dry, it makes you realize why it's all you can eat.  No complaints about the salad :) and if it wasn't for our outstanding waitresses Ashley, we would have just walked out.<//review>

There was no marinara sauce underneath as stated on the menu. We requested to speak to the manager and she stated she was sorry but that's how it comes out. This was an experience that we had not experienced from Olive Garden in previous years. We have been to Olive Garden restaurants in Minnesota, Florida, and  California just to mention a few. By far this was the worst experience we've had. As I told the manager Olive Garden is much better than this. She agreed.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Great place to go and eat. Just the service needs to improve and be more professional and on time and need more staff on better special occasions and slow times and busy times of better organized and flexible split shifts and better pay for employees who work hard there to. Need new food options and for vegans to as well.< /Review>

<review>We went on veterans day so we knew going in they would be very busy. That being said, it should not be acceptable to send out dirty plates. I ordered the mushroom ravioli and the cheese was so separated and oily I thought it had been microwaved. Apparently it sat under the heat lamp for awhile and that's what caused it. Our server was wonderful and very apologetic, she was not the one who brought us our food so she didn't know it looked the way it did.

We appreciate that olive garden supports our veterans and offers a free meal.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>We were sitted in Table 603- July 7,2019 - had a horrible service. Our sever was not so very attentive to our needs. We have to always remind her what we needed & what is not being served yet as far as what we have ordered. She gave us a supposed to be “unlimited soup and salad” with our Entree as specify in the Menu but was only given a one time- not even offered for another one or two serving and they call it “unlimited” The Soup came Cold, and normally they’ll give you cheese for the Salad and soup to sprinkle but she never asks, we had to grab it from the table from another side and do it ourselves. Had to ask for Napkins several times, our appetizer came so late & almost didn’t come had I not asked for it. Our main entree came, (before the said appetizer) and with missing, silverware in which it took a while ( i guess were suppose to eat with our hands- sorry we weren’t notified 😜) our desert came after again we had asked where was it.. basically one question- one answer portion kinda thing. My To-go had to be reminded again to her that we are actually leaving and that we are still waiting... it was just a horrible service from our waitress... and Yes I still give her a Tip inspite 🙄🙄<//text>< Time>

The receptionist misplaced us and it took our server well over 5 minutes to locate us. After that she was quite attentive to our needs.  She gets a much higher rating.<//Review>

So-so seafood stuffed mushrooms appetizer, too-small 'shrooms and not really suitable for sharing for the price. House salad good. Bread sticks too salty. Pasta platings ridiculously huge.
Best thing was friendly attentive service by Jonathan! ~great~ and a birthday NYcheesecake dessert with artistic plating & singing.<//Review>

They didn't include the cutlery as I requested.  Also no napkins.  My meal was so-so.  It was shrimp and noodles in a white sauce.  The noodles were good.  The shrimp, although there were a lot of them, were not that great.  They were quite rubbery and bland.  A dissapointment.< /review>< time>

<Review>Here we go. My one star is solely on this experience. My co worker and I arrive at 1:00p to have lunch. After we are seated our waiter comes and my co worker asks him what soups do you have? With slight attitude he says," the 4 we always have". She looks at him and explains she is asking because she doesn't know. This irritates us. We are expected to tip our waiter or waitress not just because they bring your food to you, but based on the whole dining experience that they provide. We are ready to order but he stops us from providing this to him because he is only taking our drink orders at this time. He takes really long to bring us our drinks and to take and place our order 25 minutes later all we have is our drinks. No bread, no soup, no salad. On top of that the table behind us is being served faster than us even though we arrived before them. Noticing this we get up and leave. Train this man please!</Review>< pictures>

I don't like The Olive Garden's spaghetti and the shrimp sampler was only tolerable when that gave us marinara sauce as a dip. The two that come with it suck and they don't even have shrimp cocktail sauce for shrimp. That also sucks! The best part of the evening was the sweet young waitress and her service... Not good with names but she was cute.<//Text>

I had to wait for a seat at 11:30 am when the place was virtually empty.  Then they sat us directly under the AC vent where it was freezing.  To make matters worse,  the food was cold when it came to the table. Not cool.</Review>

<Text>Cannot make reservations for the Vallejo restaurant. We like to take small grandchildren out to eat and this place had a 45 minutes wait. (Gee, you refused to take our reservation over the phone 30 minutes earlier. We were told reservations are taken at other Gardens, just not in Vallejo. Systemic problem). Food and service is good, but that horrible wait. We left. Got right in at Black Bear.<//Text>< pics>

Expect wait of at least 30 minutes.  Food was fast and fresh but just ok. Salad and all you can eat bread sticks as always.  Silver Ware is old and ugly and many empty tables? Not enough servers.  Our server was nice. Good place for big families with lots of kids.<//Text>

$35 for lunch and left hungry. Double order of fried ravioli and dinner portion lasagna. Soup was thin, lasagna was flat. First time at this location and last. Others must feel the same way- the place was dead at 12:30pm.< /review>

Wow where to start. Should have expected this. Host was extremely short and couldn’t be bothered but to shove a couple menus at us then point at the bar. Sat there for about ten mins before we greeted by a server. Ten more mins later our drinks finally came out. Makes sense as the bartender was busy serving only her guest at the bar (and over serving one drunk slob). Food came out and was bland and frozen recently. Menu is cryptic (soup is $7.99, salad is free. Soup and salad is $13.99). And don’t play the computer trivia as it’s $1.99. It does tell you this but in small grey print under the huge “Let’s Play” sign.  Hey bread sticks are good!< /review>

Like always...food was great and place looks nicely remodeled.  But staff needs some fixing now, received bad service from the start.  A "hello" is a great way to start great customer service.</text>

Maybe so much emphasis was being put on the technology that they forgot an iPad would not bring the plates to the tables...< /review>< username>

Then I suggested her to go to Olive Garden.
Also I thought should be nice to try with her the Calamary appetizer...

<review>The cost doesn't make the quality or quantity... 5 raviolis for 12.99. Even with soup or salad you know you will not be full from that. Also had plastic in my chicken masala. A big piece and all she wanted to do was offer me a free meal. I'm scared to eat there.< /review>< Pics>

I must say that the food seems to have taken a dive in quality. There are some great and poor servers but the food really drags down the quality of the experience. My last visit, I had a mousse cake that seems to have been on the freezer for quite some time and the alfredo tasted bland.< /text>

For a chain restaurant they do an outstanding job serving flavorful dishes. We arrived around 11:45 today at this location and within 15 minutes there were lines and and a waitlist and we were seated promptly and our server was really really good she was young and she had a lot of tables and a lot of people but she always made you feel that she was looking after you and taking care of you and checking on you and she wasn't annoying. Overall definitely will be back tried a new dessert today which was their ricotta cheesecake and it was excellent with strawberries< /Text>

Was packed, over an hour wait ! So we didn't. Instead went to a really good Pho restaurant  (yum). I usually do enjoy the Olive Garden though so didn't want to give a bad review and to be fair this was a holiday weekend.</Text>

Ever since the new minimum wage went to $15 some or all of these chain restaraunts have gone down hill. Olive garden for example has cut down on food cost with lower quality and less value for your money. More pasta less protein and service has even suffered with fewer employees who are stretched to the max. Making for a poor dining experience for their customers.< /review>

< Review>
Its been years since I have been to  the Garden of Olives.  I enjoyed my food and beverage as did my father,  however they started out at a good pace then kind of just sped things along  and my dad felt a little rushed.   I would say just work on timing  and  just  a little more keeping in touch with your sections.</Review>

<Review>It was Valentine's day. I expected to wait awhile (took 1 hour). Only served 1 drink ( there were 2 of us). Ordered appetizer, it came. Waitress never took our main order (she said she was going to after we finished our appetizer). We had to find our other drink at the bar (it was never delivered). 2 hours later and still didn't even get to order our dinner. I used to love this place....now, not so much. Left and ate somewhere else. We were hungry! Disappointed.< /Review>< pics>

<gmapID>0x808572d4362013df:0x41160b5efb0268e9</gmapID><Text>I am a regular at Olive Garden, it’s my go to comfort food. This was my worst customer experience ever. We came here checked in for Angie party of 3. We confirmed with the hostess that we are checked in and were told there is a 35 min wait time which we were ok with. After 35 minutes, we asked the hostess how long it’s going to be? She looked puzzled and said my party name is not there. I specifically doubled checked with the girl I checked in with, & she said she doesn’t know what happened. Not even a sad sorry. She then said talking to her fellow hostess “um I guess I’ll move them up somewhere & they will be called next”. She then just turned around. I sat down and waited. we WEREN’T called. Four other parties were called. 50 minutes went by, we flagged down a manager and explained the situation. Finally got seated. This is not ok & normally we wouldn’t mind waiting an extra minute, but the hostess’ was just rude and not even trying to explain the situation to me. I’ve worked in customer service all my life and this is not how you treat the very people that ensure you have a job. Our server was very nice and apologetic but the front 2 girl hostess either need to get written up or trained properly on how to do their job.
* * the manager actually footed our bill after we told our waiter what happened therefore kudos to the server and manager for trying to make our experience better. Thank you management and server team for paying attention to your customers***</Text>< time>

<Text>Only because I cannot give zero. I want to appolize for coming at such a busy (1:00) time today. I realize you must be under staffed and no one was able to clear the table in the Cafe area. And once again I find myself apologizing for asking the hostess to get someone to clear the table, surely not her job. And unfortunately my friend walked out of the bathroom at the wrong time to hear the hostess and other employees talking about me and laughing. Boy! Did my friend have bad timing or what? And your over worked waitress not having time to even ask if we want drinks and when she is finally able she clearly was having a bad dad and could not even muster up a good attitude. Bad timing on my part all around.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Date>

I am giving them 5 stars and I hate pasta!!!

We were greeted by two very friendly ladies and seated right away. I went to the restroom and it was dirty but as soon as I told the Hostess she went right to work on cleaning it up. This was the fault of a guest and the employee handled it immediately. So, I didn't minus a star.

Our Server Kelly was very personable and attentive and she always had a sense of urgency in taking care of our needs. The Manager was on the floor helping get tables served and bussed but he still found the time to come by and ask us how our dinner was. The menu choices were mostly pasta but there were a few items I could choose from that weren't. I would like to mention that they also had gluten free pasta choices. Kelly brought us salad and bread sticks quickly. I ordered the herb grilled salmon with broccoli and it was really delicious. I will have it again. Because I indulged in the bread sticks with the salad, I was able to take half of my dinner home and will have it for lunch tomorrow.

Some other things that factored into the five star rating were that every single employee that we came into contact with at the very least smiled at us. We were seated right in front of the kitchen door and the employees were going in and out of that door like crazy because the restaurant was busy. We didn't feel like we were at the kitchen door we felt like the employees were welcoming us and taking care of our needs as they were passing by our table. Kelly brought wine to the table and asked if we'd like a tasting. She also packaged our food at the table for us. The restaurant was decorated nicely and was well lit.

I work in guest service and this restaurant lacked nothing. I honestly didn't think I would give 5 stars to an Olive Garden but they deserve it. I will absolutly be a customer again!<//Text>

<Text>besides the very long wait our server was the best... she apologized for the wait and continued to serve us up. she didn't over do it with the how is evrything question that most servers dramatically over do. meal was great. service was excellent. just wish they would have scheduled more staff during this graduation time. come on man! everyone knows that graduations run through june. EVERY YEAR! i gave this 5 stars only for our server. she was the best...< /Text><date>1528774431924< /date><pics>None<//pics><userid>100703857669222630081<//userid>< username>

Just ok. Restaurant was uncharacteristically missing a couple of menu items like 4/5 cheese ziti, spaghetti with meat sauce, which are menu mainstays. Server didn't know they menu, wasn't attentive to our needs</review>

< Review>
This locations customer service and service in general has has gone from excellent to very very very POOR. As a frequent customer that orders atleast twice a month, I can report these findings. Every time I place a pick up order they:

1. Don’t give all the items ordered or components ie. breadsticks/soup/salad/drinks( happens every other order)
2. Get the order wrong(has happened with more frequency)
3. Don’t even have my order!! (This has happened multiple times)
4. Takes about 10-15 minutes to get greeted or noticed by the staff and then another 10 minutes for them to grab your order from the back(happens every time!)

I will not waste my money here anymore. My young son loves the pasta but it’s a shame that can’t get my order right. Get it together Olive Garden!< /Review>

The waiting is unbelievable for the amount of people working here we asked the waiter to buss the table and we were rudely ignored.

This restaurant really disappointed us on multiple occasions ,  its unfortunate that the servers act like there privileged and do not provide quality service.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

They kept mixing up orders with other tables. Took forever to get our food, some of the soups came out after our main course. Plus, my pasta dish lacked flavor & was a bit dry. Only highlight was the very delicious Chocolate Lasagna we had for dessert. I highly recommend it, nice large piece & it was a surprising light tasting dessert that wasn't too rich!!!<//text>< time>

We ask to add mushrooms they asked for extra charge that’s OK but why do I need to get mushrooms that set over three weeks in the freezer plus they smelling very very bad then continue with the pasta the salamon that was a overburn not like the picture didn’t went through inside of my throat that broccoli was OK.
The brad was too crispy and too oily, the Salomon bad taste definitely definitely definitely not recommended this place there is a place in US that need to be close those are the ones that need to be shut off really I don’t understand how this place getting that much of reviews you guys never never he’s good food and you should go visit Israel then you will see what is a real kitchen!

Worst service ever!
The server never give us napkins until we left even though we asked him for so many times.
The only time I can see my server was serving food and giving us our bill. And the server was watching me and checking to see if how much I wrote their tips on the receipt. So terrible experience! Please avoid this restaurant</Review>

Beutiful ambiounce. Great for business meeting and family celebrations. The price range is moderate, but can become costly when adding meat to basic Italian dishes.< /review>

Service was very slow. Some of our food as served cold and had to ask wait staff to have it re-heated.  Wait staff was courteous but I felt like they create an atmosphere of trying to rush people through their meal.< /review>

Service was slow. Had a call ahead and still ended up waiting the regular wait time of 45 mins. Got our apps before drinks not even water was served before. Our server was a sweet heart but I believe she had table on the other side of the restuarant. So we asked the food runner if they can get us a refill or cheese for our soup or salad and were told to ask our server. I was mostly discussed by the silverware. It had dried pieces of food or sauce on it and from what I'm aware of they should each be checked for water stain before rolled to serve. As for dinner two out of a table of six had to wait for our meals maybe kitchen was backed up but I wasn't happy with the quality of the food.<//text>

the moment we walked in we noticed a foul smell, it seemed to be throughout the restaurant. furthermore service was pretty slow even though they didn't seem to be very busy. staff seemed more interested in there own drama and less intrested in there customers. maby I just showed up on a bad day but 80 bucks for two people's lunch I expect to be treated better than that.</text>

<review>Yes, the food may be good, but the service is bad. The front desk people put our party down as 2 instead of 6. Then promising us that we would get the next table, parties of 13 and more were going in even if they came after us. Once we got in, the waitor took forever. Saying they would "quickly grab" our drinks, they took until we were nearly done with our meals.</review>< pictures>

<review>Horrible service on phone, mix up in online order so called to get it canceled and money not charged. Was told we had to talk to manager, we asked for his name and she would not give it to us. She told us he would have to call back. The first phone conversation ended with a hang up on there end so we called right back. It has now been over 30 minutes and no return call. This is ridiculous!! When he finally called back he did apologize for his staff which had horrible customer service skills. Note to self, never go to this Olive Garden.< /review>< pictures>

I usually like the Olive Garden but tonight it was slow and I was never asked for a refill .. what restaurant serves you endless salad and bread but only gives you 1 fookin drink... crazy I know luckily they had ice in the cups . No tip from me but I'm sure the lady snuck  1 in there.< /Review>

I have to think more than twice before posting this raiting. I like the place the ambience and all but, this is my second visit to this particular site.
In both ocations service was terrible. The worst was today.
We walked in around 8:50pm and the hostess told us that the waiting for a table was about 25 to 30 minutes. There was no one waiting and there were plenty of open tables. The hostess told us to go to the coffee area (bar) since they had couple of open tables there. Also, she stated that service would be the same as the restaurant area.
After we sat at a table, took about 15 minutos before someone come by to ask if we have been helped. The person said "I will be helping you, I will be right back'".
Then 10 more minutes later another guy showed up and asked us the same thing again. At that time a table was open but dishes were on it, so I asked to a guy wearing the radio and mic, if we could move from the high table into the regular one. He told us to move then he will have some one right over to clean the table.
The server brought us bread and drinks after 15 minutes and dropped them on the dirty table. Then he stated that he would come back to clean it.
After few workers went by our table they just saw but said-did nothing.
Then our server came back and told us that he was very busy so, he wouldn't be able to clean the table.
5 minutes later a lady came by and ask us if we have finished?
We explained the situation to her so she went to get a tray and helped us cleaning the table.
They told us that they had run out of cheese first, then they told us that they had run out of salad too.
There were about 3 parties on the lobby waiting for a table so I can't imagine how they would serve them. Anyway, both of my experiences were about the same so definitely I am not recommending this place at all. Their price is not cheap and they do not care about customers at all. I could of enjoyed a better meal along good service in another place.
I will not recommend this place for dinner at all. Rather pay to go across to Chevy's or Black Angus were customer service is exceptional!!!!
I should of given them zero (0) stars they really deserved it!
I hope management sees this post.<//Review>

We requested some fresh crushed garlic, the nice server brought some minced garlic from a jar. When asked how come the garlic is not fresh, she replied we don't use fresh garlic anymore! When we asked the manager, he confirmed and added it is a corporate decision! When we asked have you tried and noticed it is bitter. He said, yes I agree! When I wrote to corporate, they confirmed all of the above!!! This Italian eatery is just another american eatery with Italian dishes without the Italian cuisine spirit! Bon Appétit !< /review>

<review>Terrible wait but saw the sign saying that for waiting you get 50% discount at the bar. We'd been sitting here for 20 min., the waitress never came back to take our order of beer (system on the table was not working). Went to the actual bar, nobody available or even taking care of people waiting.
Let's hope dinner is better. Very disappointed!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Service was subpar,  multiple requests for drinks, food, and check. Ordered soup and salad had to ask for breadsticks.  I thought that was a staple,</text>

Service was slow. We were a party of 10 and to be seated quicker we got separated. When they sat us there was 4 empty tables next to us, the other half of our party said the same thing. We waited 40 minutes for an appetizer and more then an hour for our food. When we got our salad the waitress brought us 1 plate when there is 5 of us. The worst service I have ever gotten at an Olive Garden.</review>

The experience that I have had tonight was RIDICULOUS!! The server Anna seemed to be irritated  from the moment we walked in. She took our orders however when the food came out the food was COLD! We were Hesitate to send the food back but we did.
Once the bill came, it was a  disaster. We had a party of 4 and all of the orders were listed incorrectly. I will NEVER go back!!< /review>

Ok foods but the servers and managers are judgmental and will criticize what you look like. If you're not wearing Top Class fancy clothes they won't treat you with respect. McDonald's establishment has a better atmosphere.<//Review>

Our waitress was terrible. Spilled stuff on the table, didn't wipe it up. She wasn't very attentive and when we asked for to go containers she never brought them back. The manager ended up coming and asking if we were ready so we were falling asleep. 2nd time I've came to this place and didn't get good service.</Text>

Ok service it felt slow . I remember the last time I went to Olive garden I got to pick dressing and topping for my salad bowl they just bring it out with whatever and that's what you get with the " unlimited bread sticks" for two people they bring out three for whatever reason and take forever to get more when you ask.. even with only a few customer at location and five waiter/waitress I had to finally go up to someone for a to go box. I realise they have their sections but whatever happen to just customer service</Review>

Great food! But the way they do takeout is absolutely idiotic. No one to help,never on time and they are always  confused about who is next. Some executive set up there new takeout but forgot about customer service. Idiots!< /Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>This is one of 5 major restaurants in Vallejo located in the plaza drive shopping center. It's a warm cozy place and I've been several times to eat with my boyfriend but this day I went i got cold welcoming from the host that I'd never seen before so assuming she was new, she rolled her eyes up at me and directed me and my bf to a table in which she had us  turned around since she didn't know what table was availablefor us to sit at, and she was Curt to us when she  sat us down and left. Our waitress at then was refreshing so we ordered our salad, but my bf's was done wrong and after that the waitress seemed perturbed that she had to redue the order(sorry) well needless to say we didn't see our waitress until I'm assuming she felt we were completely done with our food, since she never checked on us to see if we needed refills or anything the whole hour and a half we were there. She gave us our check and scurried off once again never to be seen again. This was a very unpleasant experience because of the customer service the food was superb!< /text>< resp>

One of the worst experiences, after a full day of filled events you'd want to have a nice dinner and relax but that is not the case. 10/13/18 in the evening we went there with a group of friends we got told that the waiting time would be 40 mins for a party of four we came it was really busy. then an hour and a half later we were called to be seated once we went and sat down the place was empty. i mean they had 6 free tables. while we were waiting to get seated they had four people at the front podium to greet people basically doing nothing for 30 mins at all. instead of helping clean the place up  and free tables they just stand there  and do nothing. we got seated and about twenty minutes later we had the server come up to get our drinks order. in general i can say this is the crappiest place i ever ate , we had the slowest server and even had people helping her, getting a drink refill was no where near the five mins range . in general we left wasting 3 hrs just to eat. worst experience ever. btw the manager knew about everything did not do squat. Id give this 0 start but that just does not seem to be an option.<//review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Service is slow and took 10 minutes just to get my refill of water. The food is good but not great. My noodles were cold and hard and stuck together  (Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo).  The chicken parm on the Tour of Itally was a bit burnt around the edges. We were hungry and not going to complain or send it back. Maybe another day will be different and hope I do not have the same experience again< /review>< name>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Its good food made quickly. Love the sea food alfredo, breadsticks are always a winner. Friendly servers, hostesses. ToGo is easy online ordering. Order now or for a later pickup time/date. Its not a Michelin star restaurant obviously, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808572d4362013df:0x41160b5efb0268e9<//GmapID></record>

Staff was very unfriendly.  Had a big party and they acted like they were annoyed to be at work.  Food was so so.. I don't like that kids can play games without our knowledge of the 1.99 charge till the bill comes out.</text>

Excellent customer service! I gave our server a $15 tip...he was right on target.
The bar makes a great Mai tai....and the lasagna Mia special is DEFINITELY WORTH IT!!  The salad is coldand fresh with plenty of dresseing,and the bread is warm,soft,and coated with butter(just a himt, don't get carried away with them,they are good portions)
Overall,it was very enjoyable evening out<//Text>

Their food got me sick and they have flies roaming around inside. Their service is ok, but it doesn’t make up for the vommiting and sickness I felt after “enjoying my meal”. I’ve been reading articles about Olive Garden, I hope they didn’t give me any diseases from their food.< /Text>

Hostesses were rude and only focused on their personal lives. They treated customer differently and gave no apology for getting customers in the incorrect order to tables.</Text>

Food was sub par. They changed the sauce on the Beef toertelini and sent that back. Got spaghetti and sausage. The sauce was bland, sausage burnt and tasted nasty. Just paid and left......< /Text>

I have been to Napoli Pizza in Vallejo and Vacaville. Both are excellent as far as the variety of the menu, the quality of the food and service, and the prices. The atmosphere is modest and possibly could use some improvement.< /review>

< review>
Still good place to go if one is hungry, as I was.  They still have all you can eat soup, salad and breadsticks for a reasonable price with unlimited soda's.

This O.G. is close to the freeway, other shopping (i.e. Home Depot, Best Buys, etc), plenty of parking, but the disabled parking is awkward and when we visited around 4:30 on a Saturday it was busy (45 minute wait), so to avoid waiting (because I was hungry) we went directly into what they call a "café" (bar friendly for kids) which was small and the booth seating was horrible where we had to get up and sit at the tall tables with stools.

The reason I didn't give this O.G. a 1-star (because the food was a lower quality then other O.G.'s) is because our waiter (a black gentleman) was great at customer service, very prompt, communicative and got the job done.

Although despite the waiters phenomenal customer service, I wouldn't return to this Olive Garden, nor recommend.  It needs much improvement, and a Bar needs to be a Bar, so grown-ups can have a space to enjoy an alcohol beverage (watch the ball game) away from nonsense kids.<//review>

<review>OMG... their prices gone up with their rebranding.  For this cost, I can go to an upscale restaurant.  Only eat there for the deals because the food is only so-so.  Don't play with the "automatic menu" on the table.  I got hit with a $3.00 charge when I was only flipping through the screen.  I didn't confirm playing any games... manager removed cost from bill.</review>< rate>

Worst birthday celebration for my husband ever!!! It took almost 3 hrs to get fed and get out of there. They don't have vegan options on their menu so our waitress created something for us. It was noodles with canned tomatoes and broccoli, which would have been fine, except i was then charged 11.99 for the pasta, and 1.99 for 6 added toppings totalling over 20 bucks for this ridiculous excuse of a meal... way more expensive than my husband's chicken and shrimp. In the end, our bill was $120 and when i showed the manager she said she'd remove the extra charges, later to come back with a $20 gift card and no credit back.... funny that they think I'll be back to use it! Thanks olive garden for ruining his birthday!!!<//text>

I went about 3 years ago and let me tell you, it's horrible. I got some sort of shrimp pasta. First they was wrong 45 minute wait even though multiple tables were open. They gave us a basket of undercooked bread. Once we got the food not only was there a hair in the salad but our pasta was undercooked and the shrimp was frozen solid. They turned up the temperature in there and we asked them kindly to turn it down because I easily get sick from dramatic change in temperature. They did not listen and I ended up having a bit of an anxiety attack. But at the end of the day they gave us a $20 dessert gift card for Red Lobster (sister company) and our dinner was on the house.< /Review>

The service can be hit or miss. Some servers are more knowledgeable then others. I signed up for their eclub to get discounts. Also on holidays and events it's over crowded with long waits. I would suggest you putting yourself on their waitlist, before getting there.< /Text>< date>

I decided to go to olive garden for a quick birthday dinner nov 8, 2017. whenever I go to this location it is always packed, usually a 15-30 min waiting list each time so we usually sit in the bar area if its just me and my husband. so this Time its a friend and I, the wait is 20 min, so we hit the bar area cause we were hungry. So we sit down, and after ten minutes  a waitress finally comes and says have you guys been served or helped yet? {as we are sitting there with both closed menu's lol} so we order our drinks, and food at the same time. I had a few questions for my order, and no I am totally not one of those complicated a-holes who write reviews cause of one bad experience. So I ask the waitress instead of ordering the baked ziti alforno I should just order the pasta bowl with the same sauce same cheese, would make sense to do it since its a little cheaper{and no I'm not a cheap-o either, pasta bowls are unlimited though and I was hungry!} so we agree on the pasta bowl. my friend orders his food. done deal. so like 45 min goes by, mind you the restaurant was empty, so for a 20 min waitlist to begin with was kinda dumb, and the bar had 2 other booths filled with customers,and our soup and salad finally come out. 45 min later...soup that is already cooked in the back probably made 4 hours prior, cause everything Is just scoop and go(I worked at Olive Garden tracy fyi) and it was cold. salad was soggy like she put the dressing on and left it sitting for 45 min. Then the food comes out immediately after and its the wrong food. The meal I originally wanted but we decided to do the past bowl because it was unlimited. So the whole. birthday dinner was a disaster. I give this restaurant 3 stars because the food is ok there. not because this one time it was cold and the wrong order, But the food is just ok. Other Olive Garden franchises I've been to have much better food even though its all the same this restaurants  presentation, and the way they just throw stuff on the plate, and how there soups are always cold and old you can tell it just sits there. The waiters are very polite and pleasant of course. never a problem with them until this last run in there but hey, thats just one person.
the rest of the times I've been its been great. This restaurant really just needs new management to get on there cooks butts, and help organize the dining room areas a little better and I would def rate it a five star for this type of dining establishment. mind you I'm not a food critic. this is just my opinion. so take it or leave it, I'm no real food critic. just a hungry opinionative patron. good day</Review>

<text>Something about the Vallejo OG where all you get is Salad, Breadsticks, and Attitude! Standard fare of Italian fast food! Bar service is horribly slow, and very sloppy. Don't expect to enjoy pressed coffees like espressos and cappuccinos with your zeppoli, because they CAN"T or REFUSE to make them! LOTS of ATTITUDE at this location :-(<//text>< Pictures>

I came to eat last night almost close to closing , my server Remo was an outstanding excelenet and he meet all our needs,  polite and apologetic, i order soup  and my kids.food came with salad minutes later he came to.apologize that because it's close to closing they were out of soup and salads. But he offer other from menu, came to our assistant in time. He just brought warmth and calmness to our nite, when we didn't get what we order. Thanks REMO, for your politeness.  I would defiantly come back and be attended by REMO. Besides that food was ok, i wanted soup and got another kind that i really wasnt  happy with it.i guess don't come in close to.closing they might not have what you want.< /text>

10/16/13. Usually good but tonight I had reheated pasta, a very slow waitress that may have been overworked or new, and a manager that didn't compensate for the overworked or new waitress.< /Text>

<text>I get my food as take out/curbside.
To be honest I get the kids pasta with five cheese marinara. The mushroom sauce is good also.  It's just the right amount of entree.  The five cheese is really good.  I do get one sausage which is extra.   For the side I get either soup [ Toscana]  or spaghetti  [ choice of sauce ]   If you sign up on their website,  OG will send you an email for a free birthday dessert.   Luckily this time of year [ Nov. BD ]  they have pumpkin cheesecake &  it  is   delish !
The chicken parmigiana is really good also.  It's enough for two or if you want leftovers.   Yummo  !!
The staff are always really nice  !!   Mangia< /text>< Time>

<user_id>108169235385749384576< /user_id><Text>(Translated by Google) I was surprised that the olives in the garden salad were too salty to eat.
Overall the food was good but the server was not professional so I felt uncomfortable eating.
Not too busy and free ...

난 예전 가든샐러드속에 든 올리브가 너무짜서 먹다 놀라고 했으나 오늘은염도가 적당했다.
전반적으로 음식들이 덜짜서 좋았으나 서버가 프로페셔날하지 못해 음식 먹으면서 불편함을 느꼈다.
바쁘지도 않았고 한가했음해도...아쉽다.< /Text><Rating>3<//Rating>< GmapID>
