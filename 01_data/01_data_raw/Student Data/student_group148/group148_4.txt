I recently had the pleasure of selling my home with Sheri Cohen. After making a snap decision to sell our home, during the pandemic, Sheri quickly and gracefully scheduled all the necessary appointments. She kept us on track and up to date on the progress every week. She sold our home quickly, with an all cash offer above asking! I don’t know if it’s possible to say this, but we truly enjoyed the selling process, and recommend Sheri to all our friends. We look forward to working with her when we start the home buying process again.</review>

< Review>
Andrew Lewis Homes provides a personable and professional experience when it comes to selling and buying a home.  From day one the Andrew Lewis Homes team had been responsive to any questions and had gone out of the way to make sure we knew everything we needed to in order to walk through the selling of our home.  They helped us prepare for the sell of our home, arranged for professional photos and video tour, and launched a successful open house.  We were less than 5 days on the market and found ourselves accepting an offer out of a list of competitive offers for a gracious amount over asking price.  The complicated paperwork associated with selling a house was a breeze with the support from this team.  Not only were they walking with us through the sell of our home, but they also provided the same great customer care and helped us navigate the process of purchasing a home.  The selling of our home and the purchase of the new home was happening simultaneously and yet seamlessly.  Their reputation in the community is one of integrity and professionalism-which made working with the seller's team a pleasant experience as well.  Andrew, Justin, and Summer, thank you for awesome work!  My wife and I highly recommend this team to anyone wanting to sell and/or buy a home.<//Review>

Thank you for helping us sell our home fast and  professionally.  During a time of uncertainty your team made us feel comfortable and gave us advice on how to prepare our house for sale and go through the whole process smoothly. You and your team rate 5 stars in our eyes! We can't wait to use your company again in the near future!

Working with Sheri is something I miss dearly. Her work ethic is incredibly impressive. Not only can she carry a heavy work load, but you’ll never feel like less than family in her presence. She’s kind and professional. With her she brings the  ability to anticipate needs and accomplish them in a timely manner. She’s a good listener and a wealth of knowledge. I have nothing but positive things to say about Sheri.</Review>

I have known Colleen Muckey almost all of my life.   I have never experienced an instance in which I was disappointed in her personally or business-wise.   She is ethical, hard-working, conscientious, responsible and when she makes a commitment to you, she honors her word.
Colleen has strong Christian values which I believe have led to her having high expectations of herself and lives by those values, treating everyone she encounters with a friendly smile and with respect.
I trust Colleen in all aspects of not only my business related issues, but personal as well.  I know she always looks out for my best interests and treats me fairly. I recommend Colleen in any and all business related dealings or transactions.  She has never disappointed me and goes above and beyond what is expected or asked of her.</text>

<Review>Andrew Lewis Homes occupies its own class of service—my wife and I love these guys. We sold and bought with them. Our deal had three contingencies— all of which had to fall perfectly in place in order for escrow to close on all three properties. Andrew and Justin guided us every step of the way and kept us up to date on everything. There really isn’t a reason for you to keep researching real estate agents. Just call or email them. You won’t regret it.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1614102239417, 'text': "Thanks so much for sharing your experience with us, Chris!

<Text>I had the privilege of working with Garrett Schwarz regarding real estate project. The project was very complicated and required his insight. Garrett guided me through the process, was patient, and achieved all of the goals I had for the project.

Garrett was prompt, professional, and very knowledgeable. He truly cares about his clients and wants to satisfy their interests. I will certainly refer my friends and colleagues to Andrew Lewis Homes because I know they will be in good hands.

I am so grateful to have worked with Garrett and look forward to seeking his wisdom in future projects.</Text>< pics>

<text>Sheri Cohen has the ability to make you feel safe and well informed at the same time. Her warm personality is as much a strength as her professionalism and knowledge are a comfort. It is refreshing to meet someone who truly enjoys her career and is passionate about her clients and their properties. You’re in good hands with Sheri. She’s hardworking, knowledgeable and just a very kind human being.<//text></record>

Justin and Andrew worked diligently and professionally in selling our house in Corona. They  communicated options and opportunities, keeping us updated in real time! The open house in selling our home of 32 years was over the top and produced purchase offers we couldn’t refuse!  We are so grateful to have found such professionals in handling both of the sale of our old home and our new home purchase! Thank you Andrew Lewis Homes! Thank you Justin and Andrew!<//review>

My husband and I are currently renting with hopes to buy within a year. We knew nothing about the real estate market so we reached out to Andrew Lewis Homes. They were so patient and knowledgeable about the current market, and alleviated our stress (as soon to be first time home buyers). We were quickly put in touch with an agent. Dylan was so pleasant to talk to and helped answer all of the questions we had. When we are ready to purchase we won’t have to look any further for a real estate agent because we found Dylan at Andrew Lewis Homes!</text>

The second house Andrew showed us was the one. He took our needs into account and made the process extremely quick and easy. Didn’t waste anytime and worked at our pace. Hope to buy another house through Andrew in the future.

Honorable mention to Dylan for pointing out extremely remarkable hidden features and helping us envision our lives in the house.</Review>

I have known Sheri for over 10 years.  She is one of the most caring and sincerest people on the planet.  Always going the extra mile to help.   When she decided to get her real-estate license, I applauded.  I cannot think of a better person to trust with one of the biggest decisions facing a family.   - tom<//Text>

I would highly recommend Justin,  they whole team is fabulous but we worked mainly with Justin. He is knowledgeable not just in the housing market but the area, schools and even best places to eat. He has a lot of energy and uses that energy to make his clients happy. I would highly recommend Andrew Lewis Homes if they do not have the information you need they are happy to research the questions and find the answers for you.</Review>

Selling a house is not an easy task, but when you find the Right Realtor Sales Agent.... I didn’t had to worry at all. I am so grateful to agent Chantal Aleman for putting the extra mile in selling my house. Now she takes in consideration my needs regarding price, space and location for what will be my future residence too. Very Grateful!!<//text>

<Review>Andrew and Justin are absolutely incredible! We were selling our first home and didn’t know where to start. Once we had our first phone call with Justin we knew we were in great hands. They were responsive to every communication and understood our needs. They are very knowledgeable about real estate and their marketing skills are brilliant. They sold our house for more than we ever thought possible, brought us over thirty offers within three days, and gave us valuable insight into picking the best buyer. They consistently ensured that through every step of the process we were taken care of and they are absolutely who you NEED when selling your home. We give them our highest recommendation. Thank you, Andrew and Justin, you guys are seriously the best in the business!<//Review>< pictures>

<user_id>111535194126964091067< /user_id><time>1614200346491<//time><Review>My girlfriend and I started talking about buying a house May 2020. I decided to call Garrett at Andrew Lewis Homes and he was so helpful right away! I wanted to look at houses and that weekend we were already looking at homes in the area we wanted. He did an amazing job throughout the whole thing. We decided to buy a new build home in Menifee and the process was quite rough for us with the builder dragging their feet. Any problem we had and at any time (I was calling Garrett sometimes at 10 at night) Garrett would answer and solve the problem the best way he could! He even secured us extra money from the seller for closing costs which is pretty rare with new build lenders! Overall we are in the house and so happy! I recommend Garrett to everybody that I know that is looking to buy a house!!<//Review>< Name>

Andrew is very professional and honest. Communication was awesome. He held my hand through a complete remodel and the sale of my home. He sold my home for $25,000 over asking and it was a done deal in 12 hours!!!! He walked me through every paper and the sale was seamless. I highly recommend Andrew Lewis Homes!

Not enough good things can be said about Garrett. When I bought my first house he was a great advisor and really took my family’s well being into account when giving me advice. He even took the time on his busy weekends to answer my calls, and talk me off the ledge once or twice. Highly Recommend!</Review>

The whole Andrew Lewis Homes team truly goes above and beyond to give customers exactly what they need. They help ensure that your experience when buying or selling a home goes as smooth as possible.

Garrett Schwarz is reliable, professional and connects with customers on a whole new level, making them feel cared about, rather than just looking at them as a number.< /Review>

When buying or selling a home it is important to know that you are working with high quality individuals. I would like to attest to the knowledge, honesty, and enthusiasm of the marketing coordinator, Porsha. Andrew Lewis Homes clearly employs high quality people, who have the capability of easing what could otherwise be a burdensome process. I would definitely recommend a prospective home buyer or seller to consider their services.</Text>

Could not recommend working with Garrett Schwarz any more. Not only does he bring his knowledge and negotiation skills to the table, he also has a genuine passion for the work he does. With this passion comes the desire to not only find you the home of your dreams, but also make the normally gruelling process of buying a home easier than you could ever imagine.</text>

My experience with Andrew Lewis Homes has been the pinnacle of professionalism. From the start of staging my house to the minute it closed, I felt like they really put a personal touch on everything. Its not common to get both that kind of customer service along with the reach their marketing platform has in one service.</review>

When I moved into my house. I know we had the inspector check the heating and air. However somehow during the cold winter days of which hardly happen in SoCal. My heater does not work. After many, I mean many of service calls Garrett Schwarz hired his own electrician who figured out how to bypass a serviced unit and explain to the service writers obviously what they were missing this whole time. So his attentiveness and above and beyond service goes greatly appreciated. Keep up the great work 👍🏼< /Review>

< Review>
Working with Justin/Andrew and his team was an awesome experience. I lived 75 miles away from the home I was purchasing they made the process simple and easy. Their team are knowledgeable and helpful. They really want to do the best for their clients. They helped me with the sell, purchase of my new home, and were able to get me $30K above listing price. I highly recommend their services and I will forever be grateful for their help!<//Review>

I've had the pleasure of working with Garrett Schwarz, He was extremely informative during the process of finding my wife and I our first home.

We ending up holding off die to the pandemic but nonetheless, Garrett was always communicative with us and made us feel so comfortable throughout our search.

Highly recommend!< /Text>

As if buying a home isn’t stressful enough, we decided to move during a pandemic and honestly I don’t think we would have gotten through the process without Justin! He walked us through every step and really fought for us to get the house of our dreams. I recommend Justin and the whole team at Andrew Lewis Homes 100%. We will forever use Justin in the future and tell all our friends and family that he’s an absolute must.</review>

Chantal is an amazing agent!

People person, trustworthy, honest, professional, hard working, a valuable asset to anyone who hires her, and the list goes on...

Thank you Chantal for the level of professionalism, integrity, & diligence you provided at every capacity of service. You’re definitely a “must have” as my SoCal/ CenCal real estate  agent.

Oh, and did I mention bilingual???

Thanks again Chantal

Sheri Cohen is wonderful! She absolutely looks out for YOUR best interest. Sheri helped my fiancé and I purchase a home in 2019 and really went above and beyond in walking us through the process as first-time home buyers. I can’t imagine having used anyone else. Hard-working, relatable, and knowledgeable - I would highly recommend Sheri Cohen!</Review>

My experience with Andrew Lewis Homes went as expected. They got the job done in a timely and professional manner.

Garrett Schwarz was my realtor: he was young and ready to hit the ground running. He did well under pressure, and listened to my grievances as they came up. Garrett was very familiar with Riverside and San Diego county communities.

A huge benefit to working with ALH is the availability of staff for odd hour scheduling.
If my realtor was unavailable a colleague was ready to show me properties.

I applaud Garrett and ALH staff for their dedication to closing deals.<//review>

< Review>
Couldn’t ask for a better home buying experience than what I had with Justin McCabe. He always shot us straight, even if it wasn’t what we wanted to hear. Had the answers to all our questions, made himself available throughout the entire process (and even still). A++ Couldn’t recommend enough!</Review>

My husband and I worked with Justin to purchase our first home, and we have nothing but great things to share! Justin was awesome, he helped us through every step of the way and was always responsive any day any time. We were scared and did not know a whole lot about buying a house, but Justin was very knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable. Andrew Lewis Homes made home buying as easy and simple as could be. Justin, Summer, and Andrew helped explain each step throughout the process and answered questions quickly. These guys rock!<//Review>< pictures>

We talked with Andrew and told him what we thought we wanted and what we thought we could afford.  He provided us with listings that met our criteria and allowed us to choose houses we wanted to look at.  He was very patient in showing us several houses while we tried to select one that was right for us.

He walked use through the process of making an offer and negotiating price.  Then helped us through escrow and understanding the vast documents that must be reviewed and signed.

Andrew is very professional, organized and detailed.  He kept us up to date on the status of our purchase, and was very patient to answer our many questions.  I would highly recommend Andrew Lewis Homes to anyone looking to buy a house.< /text></record>

<rating>5</rating><Text>This is the second time that I have used Andrew Lewis Homes. We were looking for a home that would work for having my mother-in-law move in with us, but also provide her with her own space and privacy.

We were able to find the one house that fit the requirements and wants list, and we made an offer. Andrew worked tirelessly and endlessly to work with the selling agent throughout the process, and demonstrated patience, determination, compassion that isn't found in many people.

Throughout the process there were some speed bumps and difficulties that we had to work through, however they were unavoidable and no fault of Andrew. In fact he went above and beyond what could be asked of an agent, and he did it joyfully and effectively.

I could not tell you how much I enjoyed working with Andrew and how much I would recommend him to anyone looking to purchase or sell their home.< /Text>< Pics>

For anybody selling or buying a home it can be an overwhelming experience to say the least. Working with Andrew and his team took away any fears, questions and hesitations from the start. The entire team was very professional, informative and there every step of the way! To be able to reach out with hundreds of questions and get immediate responses was very reassuring! We were hesitant to try and sell during this covid-19 pandemic, but with the marketing strategy Andrew Lewis and his team provided we had about 75 pre-qualified buyers come look at our home only 3 days after listing. Of those 75 buyers we had 25 that made over asking offers! 4 short days of being on the market, we ended up accepting an offer for $100k over our asking price!!! Talking to several other agents I know, they all agreed that was unheard of! We couldn't be happier with Andrew Lewis Homes, the work and effort they put in from conception to completion and what matters most is the results they were able to achieve! We 110% highly recommend Andrew Lewis and his team and will be using them for ourselves in the future and will be referring them to everybody we know! Thanks again to this amazing team, you guys are rockstars!!!

We just bought our first home and never thought it would be so EASY, but it was, thanks to Andrew! He took care of every detail, while keeping us in the loop on what we needed to know throughout the process. We had a small conversation with the seller's agent, who went on and on about how professional Andrew is in his handling of documents, timeliness, organization, etc. Andrew is not only great to work with from a home buyer's standpoint, but other agents like to work with him as well. Transactions go smoothly when Andrew is involved. Highly recommended!< /Text>

<Review>If you are selling a home you want Andrew Lewis Homes in your corner. If you are buying a home you want Andrew Lewis Homes in your corner. If you are buying and selling you NEED Andrew Lewis Homes in your corner! We had both and we couldn't be more pleased!

We called Andrew as soon as we decided we were considering a move and told him that we were several months out but wanted to explore the idea. We had a very limited area we wished to reside in and some may say we have picky taste. ;-) He immediately began sending us homes to look at which he believed we might be interested in. Within a few days I had found the perfect new home for our family and called Andrew. He showed us the home the next day and that was it- I wanted that house, and no other. For many buyers the fact that the home we wanted already had multiple offers and that our purchase was going to be contingent on the sale of our home (a home that wasn't even yet listed) would be a problem. Despite these obvious obstacles Andrew secured the escrow in our favor.

Now it was time to sell. The staging and arranging was a team effort since we had already entered escrow on our new home. Andrew even went so far as to hire a moving company to help us with the process and within three days we were in escrow on our existing home!

As I write this it is four weeks since we have moved into our dream home. We love our new home and truly couldn't be more impressed with how the entire team at Andrew Lewis Homes handled every situation that arose. They clearly value honesty and integrity and boy will they get you results! We whole heartedly recommend Andrew and team and are grateful for all their efforts on our behalf. Thank you Andrew Lewis Homes, you have made clients for life!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<username>Matt Crowther</username><Review>Justin helped me buy my house in December 2018.  The process was smooth and easy. My wife wasn't quite ready to take that next step but I was and Justin helped walk me through the entire process when we were finally ready to buy.  And get this, from when we first found the house, to when the offer was accepted it was only 7 days!

We had been working together for more than a year before my wife and I pulled the trigger and bought the house. Justin and I would do breakfast and talk about business and there was no pressure to buy this house sooner than my wife and I decided we were ready. I really can say that Justin isn't the typical realtor who is just in it for what he'll make off the deal. I know that Justin and Andrew genuinely care about their clients.

Andrew has also become a client of mine with solar and I know him and his family very well. You cant find a better team than Andrew and Justin who care more about what they do and putting the needs of their clients first. They know Temecula and Murrieta extremely well and are just on top of it when it comes to all things real estate, I've seen that both of them are always sharpening the saw

You cant go wrong with Andrew Lewis homes!!</Review><Time>1573608989703</Time><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>Absolutely the best in the business!

My husband and I contacted Andrew Lewis and Justin McCabe to get information about purchasing a home in about 2 years, after following their  suggestion and talking  James at Franklin loans to see if qualify, we found ourselves purchasing a home in just 2 weeks!  Everyone always talks about how stressful  purchasing a home is, working with Andrew and Justin and the team of professionals they work with, made our entire experience so smooth I would absolutely choose Andrew Lewis Homes for our real estate needs!<//review>< Pics>

I've heard so many stories of headaches and heartbreak when friends have purchased homes, but we experienced almost none of that because of Justin McCabe's hard work on our behalf - in fact, several times during the escrow/purchase process, my husband and I said "Buying a house is SO EASY." Justin helped us secure our dream home and navigate all the paperwork during the process, and he even advocated for us with our home warranty company after we ran into unexpected difficulty with the AC at our new home (which is why I said "almost" no headache haha!). He went above and beyond in every possible way. Add to that the fact that buying a house through Andrew Lewis Homes means getting to do some super fun client appreciation activities (80s roller skating night! Free family photos!), and it's a no-brainer to use these guys for your real estate needs. Justin and Andrew are trustworthy and excellent at what they do, and they make it simple even for first time buyers like my husband and me.</review>

My husband and I decided to sell our home of 25 years in Orange county and relocate to Murrieta. Andrew was recommended to us by friends. He helped us find a home and with the very complicated process of buying and selling and closing 2 escrow between different counties. He was very knowledgeable with all aspects of the real estate process. He is very familiar with all the areas around Temecula, Murrieta, Wildomar, Winchester and Menifee. He was available any time of day or night to answer calls, texts and emails. Andrew represented us as if we were his family. We trusted him completely. When things got stressful toward the end when our buyer's escrow was delayed he was calm and reassuring promising everything was going to be alright. He didn't get annoyed with us, but always calmed our fears. Andrew is a true professional who I would highly recommend!< /text>

<review>Dr. Cardall and his staff are by far the best in town! At every visit I am always greeted by the sweetest, welcoming and friendly staffs who are always explanatory and makes me feel comfortable. Dr. Cardall is so nice, gentle and patience. Even with his busy schedule he manages to get the procedure/treatment done with great outcomes. I’ve had braces for quite sometime now and was still insecure about my smile. At my last visit he temporarily lengthened my top four teeth’s. As I was driving home I looked in the rear view mirror and saw the results and instantly cried with tears of joy. I was so pleased, excited and happy on how big of a difference my teeth and smile looked. For the first time in my life ever I was able to smile big and happily showing my teeth. I am so very grateful for Dr.Cardall and his staff and highly recommend his dental office to everyone! Thank you, again team Cardall you guys are the best!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Dr. Cardall and staff are absolutely fabulous!  My bottom teeth were extremely worn down, by at least 2/3 of normal size. Dr Cardall was able to reposition my bite so that my dentist was able to restore my bottom teeth to normal size.  I now have the smile I've wanted for years!  No more closed mouth smiles for pictures 😁  Thank you so much Dr. Cardall and staff.<//Text><Name>Sandra Jimenez< /Name>< Resp>

After having experience with other orthodontists, Dr. Cardall is definitely the BEST!!!. He and his office stuff are always friendly and accommodating.  During  Covid this past year, Dr. Cardall and his stuff worked until 9 PM just to accommodate their customers after the shut down. Most importantly, If you do break a bracket or have to change your appointment, his office stuff will do their best to get you in within a timely manner. Finally , Dr. Cardall did a great job with my treatment and at a very competitive cost. I highly recommend Dr. Cardall!!!<//review>

Dr. Cardall and his staff have been AMAZING the last 2.5 years. I could not be happier with another orthodontist! He did exactly as he said and the treatment took the same amount of time he said it would. Everything with them has been top notch and such an easy process!
Thank you Dr. Cardall!<//Review>

<text>All 3 of my kids and husband, have been patients of Dr Cardall. They have beautiful smiles, and get so many compliments. My favorite part has been witnessing how much more confident they have become, smiling everywhere they go. Dr Cardall’s staff is super friendly, and with my busy schedule, I truly appreciate not having long wait times when I took my kids in for appointments.</text>< name>

Love Cardall Orthodontics! I originally came in due to severe ‘TMJ’ jaw pain and was told that by correcting my overbite it would help and I also wanted my teeth as straight as possible and he achieved that and I only had to have my Invisalign on for nine months and I have had zero jaw pain since my overbite has been corrected! He genuinely cares about his patients and goes above and beyond to give you the perfect smile! So happy with my results, my teeth are perfect now! Can’t wait to post my before and after photos! So glad I found this place! I wouldn’t trust anyone else to touch my teeth after my experience with him! He is very professional and takes the time to listen to all of your concerns. I highly recommend this place. And not just for the orthodontist, but also for the dentist here to, Brimhall Dental group. Both my husband and son go here now as well.< /review>

I’ve been to many dentist and trying to find the right place to do my treatment and this place was the BEST! From the very moment I walked in for my consolation with my niece they were the kindest and generous staff giving her all sorts of treats while the financial advisor helped me with my treatment plan. And even when I thought I couldn’t afford it they helped me even more and made sure the payments would be good for me instead of charging me a boat load. And every appointment after that was amazing they’re a very friendly and helpful staff a great place to come and chat or get your braces done. I loved coming it was a great experience every time. My favorite dentist lady was Aspen, she  always looking out for me and trying to get me in for the best appointments and she worked with my schedule more times than I can count. So if you’re reading this thank you for making my experience better. Have a great new year and get a new smile with Cardall Orthodontics.< /text>

Cardall Orthodontics has been amazing! I haven't had any complaints with them. Anytime I needed to reschedule an appointment (which were a couple of times), the office was quick and happy to help. Their office is clean and welcoming, while their treatment is quick and very effective. To much surprise, I was able to get my braces off early! Thank you to Dr. Cardall and his hardworking team, you guys are great!!< /Text>

<review>Cardall has been thorough and efficient with every visit making the whole process of braces easy.  With a busy schedule we’ve been able to get in and out easily which helps a lot. They’ve also been very good in answering questions or walking us through each visit.  Bonus is you can take your kids dipping dots after each visit because they shouldn’t be eating that stuff with braces. So I get something out of it too!</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1610147479769, 'text': 'Thanks for the nice review!

My overall experience with Dr. Cardall and his team was the best; to sum it up they are professional, courteous, caring, engaging, and most of all a joy to be around. Dr. Cardall and his staff make you feel like you are close neighbors dare I say family! Definitely feels like there is a good southern hospitality theme when you go into the office, but instead of sweet tea or lemonade they give you dippin’ dots every visit! This place is great! I recommend this place to everyone!

I was originally supposed to have my braces for about 12 to 14 months but that changed due to COVID-19. I ended having my braces for 18 months, but despite set back they made it right. Dr. Cardall hit me with the news I was going to need the braces a little longer than expected due to the combination of the pandemic and my stubborn teeth not wanting to shift. Dr. Cardall made sure my teeth were perfect before removing my braces. He has pride in his work!  I am extremely happy with how my teeth are now.<//review>

I'm reviewing 5 stars because for the past 2 years of being in Cardall Orthodontics, I never had a problem or complaint. To start off, the office itself is modern and stylish. The receptionists are patient and kind. Whenever I needed new rubber bands for my braces, they happily gave me more. Not to mention I got 'Dip N' Dots' at the end of every visit! ( several flavors to choose from) Everyone there is really nice and professional. I'm pleased to say that even though Covid-19 has made everything difficult, that I feel safe with all the regulations that are done there. I'm a bit sad that  I won't be going there anymore, but overall pleased with the outcome of my teeth, now straight. I feel more comfortable smiling, and that's really the most important thing: feeling confident in yourself. Thank you Cardall Orthodontist for everything!</review>

<text>For so long I've felt very insecure about my smile. I didn't like the way my smile was and didn't like to show my teeth at all. But when I came to Dr. Cardall he changed that for me, and ever since I've been comfortable showing my teeth and being able to smile. I love my smile now and am so thankful to Dr. Cardall and his team.<//text><time>1610774710080</time><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x80ea43201cc3992f:0x8a0ae783f4987eb9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I did an Invisalign treatment through Cardall and the transformation is night and day. I used to be so self conscious about my teeth but they were able to make me feel happy with my smile. I’d recommend anyone and everyone to receive treatment at Cardall!<//review>

Dr. Cardall and his team are just fabulous. They are all so kind and welcoming. My daughter just had her braces removed, and we are thrilled with her results. Her teeth/bite were not too bad when we started, but over the last 16 months of treatment, her smile has become nearly perfect. I'm so happy we found this team of professionals. We will definitely be back when it is time for our youngest to get braces.</Review>

Everyone in the office is always very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing and positive. I especially appreciated their newer equipment as well. They use a digital wand to scan the teeth for both braces and for retainers. This method is so much better than the old way of placing a putty like substance in your mouth to get a mold of your teeth. I definitely recommend Dr. Cardall to all my family and friends!< /review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Cardall and his team are absolutely the best, overall very professional. I definitely recommend Dr. Cardall if you want a perfect smile he really cares about the outcome of your teeth. I’ve had my braces for a year now, I am extremely happy and really love how everything is going so far.</text>

<Text>Dr. Cardnell  and his team are wonderful!  They have made the process of going back for corrections after 30 years so simple and pleasant.  I was impressed with the state-of-art assessment tools, the friendliness of all the staff, and the overall ease of the process.  Aligners have been my course of action and I am already amazed with the results 3 months in.  I highly recommend Cardnell Orthodontics!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Great and friendly staff. Had a staff member call me out of the blue, remembering we were needing some more rubber bands, and was able to help us get more because we live out of town.

<review>When we brought our son Aden into see Dr Cardall his mouth looked like something out of a horror flick!  2 years and 29 days later, he looks just like Brad Pitt!  I’ve never seen a teenager smile so much.  In all seriousness, Dr. Cardall is a master of his trade and has a very professional, and courteous staff.  We have every intention of bringing our younger son to Dr. Cardall so he and his team can work their magic once again.

I took my son to various orthodontic offices in town. Dr. Cardall was hands down the best! He took time to talk me and my son about the treatment he needed. He was patient with my son and showed genuine interest in what he had to say. Even though Dr. Cardall did not feel it was the right time to start his treatment, my wife and I are assured that we have found our orthodontist. We highly recommend Cardall Orthodontics.</Review>

The staff is very welcoming and nice. I am young and I wasn’t really sure about the treatment process, but Dr Cardall explained everything to me clearly and answered all my questions.Their payment plans are very flexible. I appreciate how Dr. Cardall is picky about how he wants the results. I am very concerned about the cosmetic aspect and I appreciate he is concerned about that too. I feel that when I’m done with this treatment I’m going to have that Hollywood smile that I can pull of with red lipstick.</Text>

< review>
I had braces before in my teens, my orthodontist at the time, moved offices and I couldn’t reach out again. I lost my retainers and my teeth fell back to how they were. When my sister in law said that her kids were seeking treatment, with Dr. Cardall I called and scheduled an appointment. I have loved seeing the progress of a better smile. I was always self aware of it, and it made nervous to smile or laugh. I’m still not done with treatment, but it has raised my confidence in smiling. I love their friendly staff, and understanding in the procedures. Every time I come in, I’m met with a smile!
I recommend Dr. Cardall, if and when my kids need treatment, I will definitely come back to him. If you’re looking for a better smile, come to Dr. Cardall, he is friendly and talks with you at every appointment.<//review>

Cardall orthodontics is the best of the best. I've never had braces before and Dr. Cardall makes it easy and comfortable and you always see him at every visit and he makes sure your braces are perfect for you. The staff is awesome as well they always have a smile when you walk in and they make sure they can get you in if you need something fixed, or whether you have any questions either they or Dr. Cardall will answer them.

Bonus is you get dip n dots after every visit too.
Best Orthodontist office ever!!!< /text>

Cardall Orthodontics is a step above. They truly care about the patient and not about their bottom line. My two girls are always so happy to go see Dr Cardall and the lovely assistants. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful! We can already see amazing results and can’t wait for the final product. Thank you Dr Cardall!< /text>

Big thank you to Dr. Cardall and staff for seeing my daughter during this Covid-19 time, we truly appreciate you all! Aspen is always funny and friendly to everyone. Dr. Cardall is very knowledgeable and helps you to understand the treatment is full detail. He answers all my questions and shows me on the xrays what were talking about so I can fully understand my daughter's treatment. We look forward to the years ahead with you all and 100% recommend my friends and family to you!< /text>

Dr Cardall is always super friendly and gentle with my girls. And have to make a special mention for Aspen who we always look forward to talking with while she works on my girls.

I went in to start my invisalign treatment and it was a fantastic experience! The staff was very nice and welcoming and genuinely seemed to care which is hard to find these days.

Dr. Cardall was very nice and knowledgeable and made you feel very comfortable. I also really liked that the equipment was updated and very high tech which made things very fast. I highly recommend!</review>

If you are ever looking for exceptional orthodontist service, I definitely recommend Dr. Cardall.  From the moment I stepped into his office,  Dr. Cardall and his staff ensured  that me and my family felt welcomed. He explained the process very clearly,  making sure every question we had was answered. One of the best part of his service is the free dip and dots after every appointment! 😉</Review>

It was an affordable, and convenient option for me because i didn't have to come into the office more that 3 or 4 times.< /review>< pictures>

I had a great experience with Dr. Cardall. He was professional, friendly, and exceeded my expectations. I had Invisalign for 9 short months and was very pleased with the care and results. He was helpful and prompt with any question or concern I had. When I lost my retainer he got me fixed up with a new one no problem. I was able to get appointments booked easily and didn’t have long wait times. You can tell he cares about his patients and loves what he does. It definitely shows in his work!</text>

Dr. Cardall and his staff are professional and friendly upon arrival making you feel welcome. Dr. Cardall explained the process of my sons braces to myself as well as including my son in the conversation. This made him more at ease and comfortable with the process. His new office is very welcoming and comfortable also.< /text>

<text>I am half way through my Invisalign treatment and I love my new smile. I’m excited to see the end result! Dr. Cardall and his staff are amazing! I always look forward to my appointments.
I also really like that Dr. Cardall starts consultations at age 7. So far no braces yet for any of my kids but then the times comes they will see Dr. Cardall for treatment. He is the only Orthodontist I trust with my kids smiles!< /text></record>

<Text>I was transferred here from my previous dentist and at first was reluctant but I’m now very pleased to be able to complete my ortho here. Staff is very friendly and courteous. They are prompt with appointments and have had little to no wait time. This is great for an adult like me because I have a busy schedule. I couldn’t ask for a better dental office to attend.</Text>< Resp>

<Text>Dr. Cardall and his team are fantastic!  I began with him in spring of 2019 to fix a few issues that time and earlier orthodontics never solved.  After nearly a year of treatment I can say that I have never been happier with my bite or the appearance of my smile.  My wife saw the results I was having and began treatment just a few months later.  Now, the first of my three daughters is beginning her ortho treatment.  It’s exciting to have someone local that we trust and are so easy to work with.  I highly recommend Cardall Orthodontics!< /Text><response>{'time': 1579288664719, 'text': 'Thanks Doug!

This office is amazing. We had always heard about Dr. Cardall but i didnt fully understand how different if office was until I brought my son to see him. He has all the up to date technology. His staff is all very nice, and the wait time is hardly anything. If you need braces come to see Dr. Cardall.</Text>

<text>Dr. Cardall is amazing! I didn’t get braces until I was 30. He went over all my options with me and answered any questions I had. I had a very gummy smile but couldn’t afford to do surgery. He was able to use a different non-surgery technique to get the results we wanted. I have gotten so many compliments on my smile. He is very knowledgeable and great at what he does! I would recommend him for young and old! It’s never too late to get that perfect smile!</text>< pictures>

What an amazing Orthodontist.  Dr. Cardall is an expert with orthodontics. He has treated all of my children and we love him.  He is kind, gentle, and makes you feel you’re #1– and that is how he treats all of his patients.  Since all of my kids are finished with braces, I am looking forward to finally getting my turn!  I also love the energetic and fun atmosphere he provides to make it enjoyable for kids of all ages to go..  He’s the BEST!<//Review>

Dr. Cardall treated my son and we are thrilled with the results! Not only are his teeth perfectly straight but Dr. Cardall recognized that his jaw needed adjustment as well! The results are fantastic. Dr. Cardall is very thorough and explains everything to myself and my son. Thanks Dr.Cardall!<//Review>

<text>Dr. Cardall’s office is friendly and knowledgeable.  Dr. Cardall treated my daughter with invisiline.  She began very apprehensive about Orthodontic work.  Dr. Cardall immediately put her at ease.  The staff are helpful, friendly, and professional.  The treatment progressed nicely.  When it was time for orthodontic work for my son, we knew we would choose Dr. Cardall again.  Highly recommend.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user>

After my wisdom teeth came out the made my bottom teeth shift quite a bit but the top as well and I became very self conscious, after visiting different orthodontic offices i finally heard of Cardall and I was starting to think I was waisting my time already checking out different places everyone seemed so pushy or rushed through consultations, I didn’t feel good or confident in any office up until Cardall’s it was quick in the lobby , they were super knowledgeable and I got to see Dr.Cardall for the consultation which I believe is very important to know who’s working on your mouth not just the assistants (but they were amazing as well) every thing was thoroughly explained and you just got a very welcoming feeling from them. I’m no where near where I’m supposed to be according to Dr.Cardall but believe me I see such a significant change in such short time and every time I go in they don’t change who they are they are still very thorough in explaining still very kind and welcoming.  I’m not done with my journey yet but my experience is soooo amazing and I definitely recommend this team to everyone! I am driving three hours for this service and best believe it’s sooooo worth it!< /text>

<Review>We love everything about this office! I came in with my super hesitant 12 year old and walked out an excited mom of a kid with braces! Lindsay is super sweet and comforting, the entire front desk is personable and pleasant to interact with and spend the time to not only make sure all your questions and concerns are taken care of but get to know each patient and their family personally. It's got a family feel when you walk in! Best of all Dr. Cardall is not only knowledgeable but gentle and sweet with my son. I was so nervous for this experience before we walked in, now we can't wait to stop by to see everyone, check on his AMAZING progress and eat some dippin dots!

One of the perks for us financially was that everything is included in our package. We have already had a few brackets fall off (kids!) but they got us right in and fixed them!

I would HIGHLY reccomend Dr. Cardall and their staff! If you're considering an orthodontist start following them on FB. You will see how fun the staff is just through their posts on FB!<//Review>< Rating>

Excellent fast sweet service!  Food as expected. They want you to go in from one of the doors though for social distancing. I wish they had clear signs for directions for preferred entrance to avoid confusion 😁< /review>

<Review>Not too busy of a restaurant. They were out of lobster the tonight. They charge extra if you want more than one side of butter for dipping crab or for potatoes. Service was good. The king crab legs were very good. They have all beers for $3 during happy hour. #LOCALGUIDES</Review>< pics>

<Text>Great food. Bad customer service.  The workers just want to pack up and get out before the closing so they stop taking orders and each time change the closing time which on Google is stated at 9:30pm. I called st 7:50pm and they said phone orders are closed and if I want to make in person order I have to get there by 7:55</Text>< pictures>

I have been to the westminster Santa ana and Irvine location and the Costa Mesa one is by far the best! The sauce is tastier with more chunks of garlic. The service was excellent! The server even packed my shrimp to go. I didn't think location matters but apparently it does because I taste the difference. Not sure if its because of the season but the crawfish are bigger and fresh. They have happy hour beer for $3 until 7pm. 2lb shrimp special! Nom!< /Text>

The shrimp are very fresh every time I've been. The Gumbo was too watery, the shrimp used in it were over cooked, taste more like a watered vegetable soup with a touch of Cajun spice instead of a seasoned flavor spice. The drinks during happy hour are cheap (most are beers). The customer service is the best ever. Great job! They will try and accommodate you if something is wrong with your order.< /text>

<Text>Love this place . Placed a very long and complicated order and the person who helped me out ( I believe his name was Juan ) ? Was SUPER patient with me and very polite . I felt really bad since I kept switching my order but he was very patient the whole time .

Would definitely come back just because of the great customer service I was provided .

Also the food is fkn delicious 😋</Text>< Name>

<text>it was easy to order a very nice place however the shrimp was mushy and it wasn't cooked all the way and then at times the shell would not peel off the shrimp correctly so I don't know what happened there maybe it was old it was Monday maybe it's the weekends batch but we ate it<//text>< pics>

(5:00 PM 4/17/2020 Friday) I have to give this place 1 star for their really bad service. I called to order for TO_GO,  then I came to pick up. After payment, I thought I just needed to wait about 10 or 15 minutes, but they made me wait for 1 hour while other people, who came in after me, got their order and go.

I like Kicking Crab but I never come to this terrible place again. I don't care this location is close to my house.< /text>

<review>All hands on deck, and by deck I mean a bag of yumster shrimp. This is THE spot for cajun shrimp. Boiling Crab who? The best crab is the kickin' crab. Never a super long wait. Great and attentive staff. Plus they also let you write on the walls! My shrimp heart has found a home< /review>< user_id>

<text>Absolutely terrible service. Ordered $65 worth of crab legs thinking that they would be good and they came to me discolored, chewy, and 2 of them even had mold. I requested a full refund and they denied it to me because the food was already made, even though I only ate 2 pieces. Worst experience at a seafood place in my life, and I eat seafood almost 3 times a week. If you care about your health and loved ones, please do not eat here, save yourself the food poisoning.</text>< Pics>

<Date>1544559411425</Date><review>Good seafood! This place gets compared a lot to The Boiling Crab, which is a well known chain that has a similar menu. I think The Kickin Crab is just as good. You get a big bag of seafood cooked in the spice blend you want. There is also a menu of more standard entrees like catfish. The mussels and shrimp are very good, and you HAVE to get an order of the corn cooked the bag with the spices and seafood. If you want to eat a lot of good seafood and don't mind getting your hands dirty, give the Kickin' Crab a try.< /review>< Rate>

<Time>1556806834945< /Time><Rate>4</Rate><Review>One of our favorite dinner joints.. we've been coming here since their soft opening and we've always left stuffed and happy.  #2 combo,  kickin style mild (used to do medium but they've kicked their heat up quite a bit recently) and an order of either cajun fries or garlic noodles.

Wear dark clothes so you don't have to rely on the apron! Part of the fun is getting messy 😂

I fully agree with the other comments regarding the service being hit or miss.. sometimes they're on top their game and other times it feels like you might as well have gotten your food to go.</Review>< Pictures>

I love kicking crab!! The shrimp, clams and crab are my favorites. Only down side is they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait a bit. It is so worth it though. Note it is a bit messy to eat so just be prepared. Hehe!< /text>

First time here.  Ordered the Dungeness crab. Discolored, chewy, then smelled it and it had a strong and distinct ammonia smell. Stopped eating at that point and now I'm worried about the next 24 hours.  Definitely not fresh.
My girlfriend ordered the shrimp and it was really good. But they knowingly served me rancid crab so never again.<//Review>

It was good. But I think with all that spice the flavor of the crab gets lost. That being said  our server was not very attentive either !!!<//review>< Pictures>

If you come with 8 or more people, they charge 18% extra to your bill. Now, does that mean they care about their customers? Avoid this restaurant.< /review>

< Review>
Good cajun food, very fun experience. I like the "kickin style" medium spice with shrimp and king crab, and i add sausage and potatoes too. Just be prepared this is expensive. All the sea food options that you can add to the mix are great but Im not a fan of only being able to add 1 pound at a time i wouldve like to try other things without getting so much. Also, not very impressed with the cajun fries but if you are a shoe string fry person you will probably like them. The quality of ingredients seemed very good and im a huge fan of cajun sea food.<//Review>

Service is a hit or miss at times and the sauce isn't as tasty as boiling crab. The boss/manager likes to sit his friends down and intercept all orders to them first rather than to you. So on an unlucky night, you'll be waiting for food while a giant table is consuming everything in the restaurant like dinosaurs.<//text>

Great food, but very messy. Be prepare to go all barbarian with this meal. Crawfish, Cajun style, with a side of sausage is the best!< /Review>

Best Kickin Crab I have been too. The food,service,and location has always been great. I have not had any complaints from friends and family that are from MS and LA. They always want to go back when out visiting us. I usually go here every few weeks even if it is just for the side of garlic noodles.</Text>

I used to go to Guadalajara tire shop on Redondo beach next to the Tozai plaza.
They sell you defective used tires for $35.
I found about Vision Tires and have been going there for all my tire needs.  They fix flats in no time. Charge like $15?  I think its similar to other places.  They are up front and fast.
Recommend it for flat tires especially.</text>

Good customer service, fair prices and fast job. Michelle, manager of this shop, provide AAA service and real discount. P.s. ask Michelle, and tell her that you are looking for  David's discount. I promise you'll get at least 10% off.<//Review>

<review>I was recommended to take my used tires here to get them mounted by Fred over at Atlantis Tire. The workers are nice decent people who seem to care and have good prices. However, their equipment for mounting and dismounting tires is no good for aluminum and painted wheels. I had a total of 6 tires dismounted and all my aluminum wheels have 4 of these marks on the inside surface.

Furthermore, when the technician used the pry bar to get the tire off or on he also scuffed up the visible surface of my wheels. The woman in the office who seems to be the manager was off to lunch when this happened so all they could offer my was an apology.

Finally, when the wheels were placed back on the technician used an pneumatic impact wrench to torque the lug nuts down. That is a big no-no as they should be properly torqued down using a torque wrench. I had to ask him to properly retorque the wheels. The tech came out with a colored torque socket. These are known to be less reliable than a calibrated torque wrench. Moreover, those sockets can lead to overtightening and damaged wheel studs. As soon as I got home I retorqued my lugs properly with a torque wrench.

I have been to many tire shops and this is the first time my wheels have been damaged by one. To the owner - please invest in proper equipment so that you do not damage people's wheels and please take the time to properly torque down lug nuts by hand.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMicz9OrG7SjEDKQCkMiSBMOi05mYdPPvdn8WJz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzdFcgJ_L2Xt2LM-CMhJAt9ZJ6U7yFtiEGGwRy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfybNyUjX9ljOhsNj1XR4YquqSAIt6cSKchQdj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcN_GP3tu-rhaCbJQ5Purein5s9buCtsxoBxsm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd2vtHV4iej9uy-aHTshCqKfmKOgmFN62gsbdo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlZOb8kgzWQyXM_tNuUzd_cJEStTGQn0Mp4QHt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>From the friendly service to the old school 1950s service station vibe. If you are a local of gardena this is where you go for tires or alignments. Very well priced for both service and tires. I was in at 9, out by 915 from flat to fixed. This place is great, and provides a great service for the local community.<//Review>< Pictures>

Great shop!! Instead of buying used tires just get new ones guys. They have really good prices on kumho tires. If you ask the guy running the shop he’ll break down which is the best price and which set of tires will last the longest.  I bought Bridgestone re71 a full set for a great price.<//Text>

Called here to get a quote for service on a set of 4 tires I bought online.  They gave me a good price on mounting and balancing as well as alignment all around.  Didn't need an appointment and the work was spot on. I recommend giving them a call if you're looking for good prices.</Text>

<Text>They are honest and stand by their work. I went in to have a flat tire patched. The mechanic was very thorough and showed me exactly where the tire was punctured and how he was going to repair it. I had to wait 30 minutes, but they were upfront about why it took so long and gave me a steep discount for my time and inconvenience even though it really was not their fault. They clearly care about their customers and reputation.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1553802551446, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing a vision tire.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b580b67236ef:0x5c01506d1c1c5535<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They do a decent job here. Nothing spectacular. If you need tires and don't mind the wait this place is reliable. There's a liquor across the street you can grab a snack while you wait.</text>

worse experience ever.  this place took two hours for them to tell me they can not put in the tires. both of the mechanics are very bad at what they do. I cannot state this enough this place is horrible and I will never come back here again if you want to save your self a headache do not come to this place at all!!</review>

Huge selection of beer and spirits. They also sell kegs here! They don’t charge for the tap just a deposit you put for the tap. Make sure you bring the keg and tap back on the 3rd day or you get $5 charge a day. They are located next to the new sprouts. They got all the snacks you need. Tons of parking.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>The owner is rude. Made a comment about prices and he replied "if you dont like it dont buy here". This guy needs to take a costumer service course. He even had the audacity to raise his voice at me. Worst experience ever, If I could give negative stars I would.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Huge selection of beer and liquor.  PRETTY friendly guys! Greets you by name! Always nice to be remembered!  Haha..
But Def helped me out last Thursday 11/2/17 with reserving a KEG last minute for our party that next day.  They had what I wanted in stock. YAY! Thanks guys! Keep up with the great selections & customer svc. Never have they failed me yet. Always have a great  selection of PUFF BARS to.😁<//Review>

<Text>Always check the math. The amount charged is often more than it should be.
And check your change.
Maybe they're trying to afford a Dale Carnegie course.
They sure could use it.</Text>< resp>

My money was stolen my order never arrived and the manager said that they would return my money the next day, but what happened was that the guy blocked my calls and I never received an answer. It is a pity that people have worked like that because the food is good but a pity that they steal is not the amount if not the act that leaves a lot to detract< /review>

<Review>The weather was perfect today and my son and husband got to ride the track for the first time. It wasn't too busy so they  were able to learn the track and get comfortable. John and NJ are wonderful hosts. We will be back soon!< /Review>< GmapID>

Came here after work and this place gets packed.  They serve great cocktails, but the place is pretty small and crowded. It took a few minutes to have our drinks ordered and made.  They were playing some old school music.  Cool spot, but wouldn't recommend for big groups.</review>

A hidden gem in a random part of town. Three stories of tiki magic with low lighting, tiki paraphernalia and amazing drinks. They even sell their own tiki drink book with great recipes and tips how to do tiki yourself.</text>

Great people run this place I don't know them personally but have seen all they do for kids and families.  When the trees get bigger it'll be great more shade for those hot weather race days.</text>

<Review>Awesome intermediate track, I love this place because of the ohv riding that's is all around, riding from here to randsberg town. Overall the track has normally been well groomed and not too crowded when I have been here, the camping areas are decent but not many of them, I can see a holiday weekend being packed here<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1529887306621, 'text': 'Thank you for checking out our track and leaving a great review!'}</resp>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Have been going here for over four years. Gotten many ear piercings and nose piercings. Tried others in the area but this is the best. All of the piercers are incredible. And when I decide to get a tattoo there is not doubt I am coming here. Not a lot of jewelry selection in my opinion, though I am picky. Regardless, this place is still the best and I look forward to all my appointments here. Customer service is also always top notch. The piercers know what they’re doing and take their time with you. Sometimes there is a wait to buy piercing cleaner, so you must be patient. But it is a great atmosphere to wait in. Very interesting gauge earrings and tattoo drawings that will keep you busy to look at while waiting.

TLDR: come here. I didn’t write a paragraph for nothing.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I’m incredibly proud of the ink I got from this shop. I got a picture perfect American traditional snake and Eagle. I also got a super custom Minnesota tattoo with a walleye jumping out of the state outline. Remarkable work. Total professionals. I’d give them more than 5 stars if I could. This shop is absolute top of the line and I might fly to CA for my next tattoo based on the quality of the work.< /review>

I was so nervous for my ear piercing experience (my originals were done as a baby), but the process turned out totally easy! The staff was kind and knowledgeable, they let my indecisive self take as much time as I needed to pick my studs and pick my placement. Zero pain, amazing healing already in only a couple weeks, quality studs. I’m thrilled!</text>

The tattoo session was great. Wasnt stuck in the front with all the walk ins so the session was relaxing (minus the line that went thru the elbow ditch 🤣). Ryan has been tattooing for a long time and it shows. The work is amazing. I cant wait to finish up this sleeve.

Will definitely be coming back (obv to finish this sleeve) for more work in the future.

I also follow several of the artists from here on IG and all of their work is superb.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc0c589b845c67:0xc28f5bbe4128a5e<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Kayla did my conch piercing and was very professional especially with the extra precautions due to COVID. Ariel (I'm sorry if I misspelled it) accompanied Skylar and Kayla through the process of selecting a piercing for me, to which ear it should go on, and finally the needle stabbing process 🤣 What a great trio to have working there, I felt very comfortable throughout the entire process and was able to go home as a satisfied customer!!!

Also, great selection of jewelry! I wanted to take them all home 😭😁<//Text>< rate>

<Text>I went to 454 to get a third lobe piercing and change my cartilage stud to a hoop. Ariel, the woman who greeted my sister and I was very sweet, bubbly and welcoming. She gave great advice about the jewelry size and shapes that would be the best fit for us. Kayla, the piercer was also very sweet natured and extremely patient regarding the placement of the piercing and answering all of our questions. Everything was very clean and sanitary. I would 100%, 10/10 recommend 454 for anyone who is looking to get a piercing.< /Text></record>

Went in on a walk-in and got exactly what I wanted. Hector, my artist, was more than I expected and made this tattoo perfect! Everyone in the shop was good company and fun to talk to. Pricing was awesome as well highly recommended.

Thanks again guys!

Sent Worm images of inspiration for my tattoo idea and he came up with a design that I love! He was super quick, which is surprising because it is very detailed for the time spent. (Ignore the blood trapped under the bandage)
They seem to take walk-ins quickly too. They got a couple people right at open asking for a tattoo, which were able to get started on within 40 minutes. I would recommend an appointment if you are pressed for time. Highly recommend!</review>< Pictures>

I have come here three times, twice for tattoos, and once for an ear cartilage piercing. I’ve been very happy with all three of my experiences; all three have been walk-ins and I was helped quickly and treated with respect. My first tattoo was small and only cost $80, my second tattoo was medium size and cost $160. So they are not super cheap, but a lot more affordable than the Arcade in Oceanside ($220 for a medium sized tattoo)! I’m very, very happy with the quality of my tattoos and my piercing. I will definitely keep coming back. Shoutout to Dakota and Kory for doing AMAZING work!< /text>

I had an amazing experience getting my first tattoo with Ryan Breceda. I'm a quadriplegic and Ryan and the staff did everything they could to make sure I was comfortable, including picking me up to get me on the table! I got crazy muscle spasms during the tattoo and Ryan was so patient and cool about it. Plus my tattoo is beautiful!< /review>

I've been coming here for over 10 years.  Lauren has been my artist for 4 if those years.  Top notch work done by great people.  I've had plenty of tattoos done here as well as a couple of piercings.  Always been happy with how I'm treated here.</Review>

I did not have the best experience with my piercing from 454. I got my forward helix pierced while on vacation and after following all instructions given my ear became very infected and I had to have my piercing dug out by another piercing studio. I kept my hair away from the area, cleaned the site daily, did not sleep on that side and avoided any water but in the shower. When I reached out to my piercer about my concerns they were not helpful and told me that I probably slept on it but they would be happy to redo the piercing for and additional $35. I already paid close to $80 for the piercing and jewelry.  I went to a different studio and they took out my piercing and let me know that the earring they used was way to long for my ear and that was probably part of the problem. At the different studio they took it out free of charge and were happy to redo the piercing once that area had healed over for FREE!< /text>

I got a huge piece on my ribs and Everyone was very professional and very helpful when it came to making me comfortable and talking me through the pain. Brad took an old out line that I had and made it into a beautiful side piece. Nothing printed off google. He free handed everything he put on my body and it came out perfectly!!! Prices are reasonable also. He's a great tattoo artist and his prices fit his work!< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Went to Sean for my first tattoo. I gave him basically 3 pictures of things I wanted incorporated in to the tattoo. And threw a little bit of a curve ball at him unintentionally at the time of the appointment. I was very detail oriented as it was my first tattoo and had a huge significance. He worked with me and worked it out to the original price I was quoted. Tattoo was everything I wanted and then some. Looks great, stoked on the work he did, wouldn’t change a thing!<//Review>

Pricing is fair, the shop is clean, and if you can't find an artist here that does what you want you should go ahead and never get a tattoo.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

This evening Shelby pierced my 5-y-o daughter's ears. Super professional, friendly place. Thank you to both Christina and Shelby for taking the time to show my daughter around and explain things so she could be comfortable. Great experience and highly recommended.<//Text>

The super skinny piercing dude was so condescending and made me feel super uncomfortable, he was the worst and I will never be back. I was wanting a gold cartilage hoop to replace my older one and a new flat nose ring. He did not go over anything with me nor act like he even wanted to deal with me. He put the nose ring and and left the stem much too long and was totally going to let me walk out of there with it like that until I asked him to make it shorter and he was audibly annoyed at my request. He was AWFUL. The 2 piercings cost me $172 and he did not inform me of this beforehand but he had made me feel so awkward for even being there that I paid it and left. Dude you pierce people for a living, its not that serious, try not being a jerk to your customers.<//review><date>1545065280220< /date><name>Lauren Mogavero</name></record>

<text>I recently had a double ear piercing and returned to the place twice complaining of pain.  I was told to wait 6 months for the ear to heal.  It just didn't seem right and  finally went to a dermatologist 6 weeks after the piercing and told I had a keloid and that it would probably get worse if I didn't remove my earring.  I can't believe I'm the first one this has ever happened to and was disapointed in the reaction I received at 454 for my $75 ear piercing. The first time I returned I was told nobody was there that knew anything about piercing.  The second time Christina told me to wait it out as long as I didn't have an infection.  In the end I had to realize my left ear just wasn't tolerating a piercing and forcing it wasn't going to help, and likely was not ever going to get better.< /text><Date>1316799796416<//Date></record>

<Text>I have been to this shop 5 times now and although I have only been tattoed by Billy (been there15 years) and Brad (owner) -- all artists are equally talented.. The shop and all artists make you feel very welcome - which I think is a very important aspect. Customer service is good. Pricing might be slightly above avg (not much) - but you are getting a TATTOO that lasts forever -- so you want to get it done by a skilled artist!

This shop does get busy so cruise in and make an appt. with the artist of choice.. FYI -- Billy and Brad are usually booked for 2-3 months. It always helps if you bring your tat idea/concept to review with the artist prior to making an appt.< /Text>< Pics>

One of the best cupcake stores ever. My favorites is the Smores cupcake & Cookies & Creme cupcake (seasonal).<//text>

<review>I was very disappointed. 1. The cupcake i bought was filled (supposedly)  with pasion fruit and when I bit into it, the was only a small dro pool of passion fruit see picture.   The cupcake itself was very very dry, I think they overcooked it. 2. Bought a cookie and we were told it was crunchy in the outside shift in the middle, when we got it, it was super hard as if it had been there for days.  Very disappointed like i said for that price it is NOT worth it.< /review><rating>1</rating>< GmapID>

Cupcakes are good...just expensive. Last time I was there I bought mini cupcakes. They are $15 for 6 mini cupcakes. Didn’t see the price on the menu. I like the fleur de sel cupcake and raspberry chocolate.< /review>

<text>Trendy, never had them. There's always a buzz about them. Idk I can see them being good. Sugar is always delicious. You have the money to pay for them burning a hole in your pocket? Go buy some cupcakes from Kara's.< /text>< pics>

<Name>Foodie Guy<//Name><Review>Bought some cupcakes for someone, just because, a number of months ago. Drove all the way from another city just to buy some for her. Questioned whether it was worth the 30 minute drive. First time purchasing them. Though not the freshest, the flavors were really good. On the expensive side.  I'm spoiled by deserts (and any food in general) made the same day so my standards can be high. I would not drive all that way for myself or my coworkers but worth the drive to buy her something she likes and see her beautiful smile.< /Review><user>113060061572258065593< /user><gmap_id>0x808561c025588a21:0xefd590c63744e270< /gmap_id>< response>

<user_name>anne roberts</user_name><Review>This afternoon I went into the Walnut Creek location to purchase 4 cupcakes. The woman working was helpful and told me that all the gluten free cupcakes looked the same and were sunken in the middle. I asked about more in the back and was told they all looked like that. I got my 4 cupcakes and when I got home I could feel that they were hard as a rock and very dried out. I guess no fresh cupcakes were made at this location today and I received yesterdays inventory or earlier. At any rate I should not have been sold these unedible cupcakes.<//Review><date>1547520659684< /date><rate>1<//rate>< gmapID>

Ice cream filled cupcakes were great According to the kids. I thought it was frozen yogurt (not creamy) average variety, Pricey $42 a dozen reg, $30 a dozen for mini. We bought a dozen and 3 ice cream filled it was over $60 dollars.</Text>

A decent variety of flavors, and cupcakes are around $3.50 each. There's a few good choices for chocolate lovers, but other options as well. One cupcake is chocolate with chocolate frosting and caramel filling, sprinkled with sea salt on top. That's one of their most popular, and it's good, but I personally have to scrape off the sea salt, as that's just too strong.<//Review>

The staff member I spoke to on the phone did not know what ingredients were used in the cupcakes, so I was not able to determine if I could eat them! I have allergens that are not the ones that have to be called out as allergens.</review>

I have been eyeballing this store for months and finally made it in today. Their display cabinets were practically empty. The service was great. The cupcakes were not what I expected. The cake was blan. The filling was too strong and the frosting tasted like flavored Crisco. I bake on the side and I am always paranoid about making my cakes and cupcakes perfect so they look professional. After being in a professional place in thinking my homemade cakes taste way better than what I experienced today. How do they stay in business? This place sucks!< /Review>

Always a wonderful selection of cupcakes! Always GREAT flavors from this bakery and I have been to many of Kara's locations. Staff is very helpful and I plan on using Kara's for my upcoming baby shower:)

I have tried many bakeries that specialize in cupcakes and nobody has been able to beat Kara's on flavor, quality, and service (not even the famed Sprinkles).< /text>

We ordered 8 mini cupcakes to try a variety of favors before placing an order of 10 dozen cupcakes for our wedding. They were beautifully decorated, the service was friendly and prompt, everything was amazing until we tasted the cupcakes, most of the cake flavors were dry and bland, the "karrot" cake did have some flavor but it was mediocre at best. The globs of butter cream icing on top are the only part with and flavor- butter and whipped sugar- if you close your eyes they all taste the same. Same taste as Walmart if you close your eyes.<//Review>

Came here from Salt Lake city, needed two exhaust pipes extended. Pulled in, got nothing but looks from the two guys there. Not even so much as an "I'll be right with you". Had to pressure one of the guys there to take a peek under my truck. Got an estimate, and told the guy I would come back in the morning. I came back the next morning, same thing. No hello, no acknowledgement whatsoever.

It's like these guys hate money. There is no interest in earning your business.</text>

We ordered two full salads, the flavor was decent as was the portion size. They prepared them fast that was nice. The only thing that was interesting was they just seemed to throw my bread in the bag, not in its own bag or wrapped in anything, just floating the bag.<//review>

I have dined there almost weekly during this pandemic and they have done a good job in delivering accurate online order. However, recently, they are CONSISTENTLY making mistakes, first, wrong sandwiches, then missing sandwiches, who knows what's for the next order. Hopefully, their management will turn around and do a better job.< /Text>

~~UPDATE~~
Went back, spoke with the manager, and he indicated that he was new to that store (by a couple of weeks), and was brought in to help clean things up and improve that locations reputation.  Ultimately he made things right, and we will be at least giving the location a try in the future to see if the changes and positive and stick.

~Original~
Never have been a huge fan of Panera in the first place, but the wife was wanting it, however this Panera location further solidified my negative feeling towards them.  I understand that they get busy, but when you have at lease 3 managers 'expediting' (check the orders for accuracy), how do you miss that 7 items were wrong with a order that had 11 items total; that is generally an "F" anywhere you go.  I get if I had ordered: hold this, add that, extra on this...  but no, these were straight "Ordered as shown" items.  Come on guys, get it together, I guys have 1 job, and that is to satisfy your customers with a minimum of "some" resemblance of order accuracy.  Food flavor was ok (and the only reason it is even getting the second star.   FAIL</review>

<Review>Panera on Mowry is still a great place. It does get busy especially during lunch. It's hit or miss in getting a table due to everyone with their laptops that couldn't find a table at Starbucks.

Food is always good and consistent with all the other Panera locations. Sandwiches, the soup, baked goodies, all still the same.

Although I have ordered using the self service kiosk in the past without a glitch, I decided to order with a real human this time and she was friendlier and faster!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI6XYt-uUlqq3m6blYoZlG9_yNK0DwI_5v5Rxv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjrbDURl4o6DkGbNyc4hPFTysBAErNpWA6Ow-F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcYx1g29YFZrvfzxZzvqMXmZ6rWhZeba7CGfa_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkgfVXRP2WCWdPbxz9zY-Y1HHCH7B7w6PLC_oR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNNr84_GKHZ0Oapbkl_XfRloQwWkYWNDsMg0MF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

I went back to Panera's and it was as we left it...great.  There is social distancing in the seating so no fears there.  Now it's time for you to go back too...same Panera's as you remember it.<//Text>

<Text>My favorite Panera. Their grilled cheese sandwich is the best in comparison to grilled cheese sandwiches from any other place in town. Their rustic cheese and tomato pizza is really good. Staff is always helpful, they take the time to make sure that I’m happy with my drinks. 💕< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc085e8e00d5b:0x4998c03cee874fae< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>This place was my favorite place until today. First, i waited outside for the order at least 10 mins after doing curbside pick up. Then i just go ahead and picked up from inside. Employee inside apologize but at-least they have to put on the system if the curbside is down. And then i added in special instructions to GRILL the sandwich and yet received the same sandwich and i had to grill by myself at home. I shouldn’t have placed the order in the first place. Never coming back 👎🏻< /review>< Pics>

Worst service and meal ever! My order didn't have the most of ingredients. Looks like this is common issue at this location. Because of the issues at Panera before, I stopped ordering from Panera from past 1 year and after having panera almost after a year this weekend, it was just awful. Don’t think I will be ordering again.<//Review>

Tried the Chipotle chicken Flatbread pizza. Got to eat it while it's hot. The bread was hard and tough once it cooled off. Not much on it. The scones are still delicious.</review>

Service is not great at the moment (12/14/2020). There is a good chance they will mess up your order. I've ordered from mobile and in person, and they messed up my order the past 2 times. Will likely still come here bc I like the food, but hope they can polish the service.< /review>

I've never had a bad meal from panera but today of all days not have had panera in 2 yrs it was awful. $15 wasted! Suppose to be my treat for myself at that.

But what really stood out on this particular visit was the renovations - the place is glowing and brighter than ever! It feels more spacious yet still homey and relaxing.

<Review>I ordered online on January 16 for January 28th (3:30 PM) pick up for 6 bags of their mini variety scones for a school function.  The order went through with the payment. I arrived at 3:15 for my 3:30 pick up. The order was not ready and the store manager said that they did not receive the order from CORPORATE. I showed her the order number and the confirmation e-mail.  She offered other items in place of my order, but I had to explain more than twice that the order was for a school function, and I wished I had that flexibility to take her offer, but I don't (the reason why I ordered way ahead of time). Corporate sent an "order cancellation" via e-mail and refunded the amount paid for the online order.

I had to fill-out a new order form on site. The scones were ready for pick up at 7 AM the NEXT DAY at FULL PRICE. I really wished I had time to go somewhere else because their service was beyond unacceptable! I still went and ordered because I had to get that specific item and didn't have much time to look for another place,  but never again.  No regard for people's time.</Review>< pictures>

Ordered the curbside pickup from car, presser the "arrived" button, wait 15-20 min, and when I go inside to check, my order was on the shelf. It's the third time it has happened. Take out that "we'll bring to you car" option from the app or make it work. I am deleting the app and won't be coming here again.< /Text>

Ordering on the kiosk was easy and convenient. Food was great! The one thing this place really needs to improve in... cleanliness. The dining area, soda area and restrooms really need attention; like a lot! This location is really dirt.<//Review>

<Text>I really like Panera Bread! However, sad to say this center needs to improve on customer service, cleanliness and quality of food!

The stuff at the counter had no clue about vegan food in the menu.
They served cold tomato soup and upon questioning their reaction was disinterested and asked us to use the microwave to heat.

Should never go there for dinner! Food doesn’t taste fresh!< /Text><Time>1572415297243</Time><resp>None</resp>< user>

< review>
I placed an order, via phone because of issues trying to place my order on-line, of 2 pastry rings and bread on a Friday, to pick up on the following Sunday morning at 8am.
When I arrived on Sunday morning, my order was not ready. In fact it was not made because "they ran out of filling" for the pastry rings. Another woman had also placed an order on-line to pick up a pastry ring and was told the same thing.
Panera could have had the courtesy to call me the day before, or even first thing Sunday morning to inform me that they were not able to complete my order.
The staff did not seem to care. They could have offered to give me a discount if I bought other item(s), but did not. They could have at least apologized for the lack of communication or the inconvenience caused, but did not.
So along with other disappointing experiences I've had at Panera, I will not return.
My advise, work on Customer Service!</review>

The coffee was great. The service was slow, and the kiosk worked half the time. It's always a challenge to get the kiosk to read your payment card. One kiosk had an out of order sign on it, even though the screen said "Touch to Start."  I got tired of waiting, so I tried to use it, and it worked. I got fussed at by an employee who told me they didn't get my order. I told her the kiosk took my money, and I bought coffee, so I was good. She came over to me twice to explain that "Out of Order" means "It's not working." Witch, please.</review>

I hadn't been to this location in quite a while because the service was so poor last time. BTW - the food here had always been good here. My experience today was a good one - my turkey BLT & avocado sandwich was tasty and arrived at my table in a timely manner.<//review>

<Review>Reasonably fast, but good food. Not a great place for coffee, but they have some good bakery goods to go with it look for their 2 + 2 offerings.

The salad I ordered was very good.  My husband ordered a tuna salad sandwich and he said it was "okay".
Their website for ordering ahead of time is a mess!  It just does not work!!
The wait is forever. Not sure if the food is worth the other two aggravation.< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Hands down the worst Panera I've ever visited. Fast order and checkout since I did it myself at a kiosk, but since then I've seen nothing except ineptitude. My name has been on the prep board for over 20min now and has barely moved. The line to order is nearly to the door, but they are unable to fill orders at a reasonable pace. People keep asking for coffee adders like cream, sugar, and lids since they haven't been refilled. Maybe they're having a bad day, but I've never given 1-star on Google...ever. This location needs a little management TLC.</text>< pictures>

I had the Spicy Thai salad. All these awesome flavors were together and separate create a wonderful eating experience, thank you. It was also filled up in a Big bowl. I also experienced,  I think, 1/2 a chicken sandwich. I went to the prep counter with it and showed them that the thin slices chicken did not even cover 1/4 the bread. The lettuce covered the bread, hmmm, sandwich should be renamed...... needless to say I barely ate any of it.
The place has finally been remodeled.  Gone, thank goodness are all the wobbly tables. The whole placed looked a bit more dressed up and hearty.
Sadly, I went for agave lemonade which I enjoy, I barely got 1/2 glass it was empty along with a few others. I made mention but nothing was done. Sheeesh, I felt like I was imposing on one woman behind counter when I asked for a knife.
Another woman was kind enough to find some salt and pepper.
The vista was an experience... I did get a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread. I hope it is not full of holes and lacking content. I have to admit, after today I am gunshot

Bathrooms out of order, cold coffee, bagel machine broken :/ The employees were very apologetic and kind, however, so i don’t blame them. Would recommend going to the Panera at Pacific Commons instead!< /review>

<text>I have a lot of liking for Panera bread in general. But, this branch in particular was not so pleasing. I tried a vegetarian sandwich and 9 veggies soup in bread bowl.
In terms of service and ambience, the place is really impressive though.< /text>< Pictures>

<date>1572060698176</date><Rate>2</Rate><review>When going to a Panera restaurant no matter where you go, they're pretty much the same.  That's really the point, right. Expecting good  quality food and service for a fair price in NorCal, SoCal or somewhere else.  However, this was not our experience here in Fremont.  The tables were not cleaned.  The food came very late.  Like 30 minutes after ordering it.  Usually we see our food within 12 minutes or sooner.  I'm hoping for better next time.  One other thing.  If you ask for water, they provide a cup not much larger than a jigger.  Maybe 4oz.  I find that very insulting and just because I asked for water instead of one of their paid drinks, I get degraded.  They must have forgotten I'm still a paying customer even if I only drink water.<//review>< pics>

Yet, after ordering, I waited 22 minutes for my order. I saw my name on the electronic wait list move up the line, and eventually be ready for pickup, but when I get to the counter, they said they were waiting for the egg to cook. First, why even tell me my order was ready? Second, the egg was ordered as over-easy. How much waiting is required?
After the 22 minutes are up, it was a total of at most 45 seconds before I got to my car and opened up my sandwich box to find that the yolk was all over the bottom of the box. Yup. The service at this location is not only slow, but they can't make a simple over-easy egg that'll survive a walk to your car. My wife's egg was exactly the same.  I could only hope that my order would be faster if they just gave me the raw egg separately, shell and all. The breakfast sandwiches simply are not worth the price.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Worst experience with the staff . After waiting for 20 mins for my turn and then ordering my soup and waiting for pickup they tell us after 10 mins sorry we are running out of that soup . Why did they order in the first time .  The manager on the other hand is the worst person to talk to who doesn’t have ethic to speak with customer and understand their problem  .. please try other branches and don’t ever come to this branch this really suck..< /Review>< pics>

For a 4-person takeout order, they didn't pack a lunch salad bowl and a sandwich! How incompetent can one get?! We noticed it only after getting back to work. This particular Franchise also has very few vegetarian/vegan choices (healthier). And they are right next to a hospital and in a city full of many vegans/vegetarians! They probably couldn't care less. Neither do I. Will go somewhere else next time.</Text>< pictures>

<review>This place has horrible customer service. The order will always come out wrong. We ordered a Fuji salad that’s supposed to have apple chips in it and once we got our salad it had no apple chips on it. So I asked the waitress if she can give me some apple chips for my salad and she ignored me. All the employees ignore you. They don’t attend to the customers needs. Every single time we come here the order is mixed up. I am never coming here ever again. The waitress with the blue hair was especially rude to my family and I.</review>< userid>

I LOVE the hazelnut coffee! Also  people are always friendly and prompt when taking orders. Lines are longer during prime times. But typically all registers are open and the line for both orders and food move quickly. Over all one of my favorite places close to the office.< /text>

<review>All good except for the internet kept switching access points. There seems to be three of them. So I wonder what was causing this behavior. It was not a regular switching which seems flawless. I would suggest looking for a better place to log in or report any known knowledge of hacking to the store property owner and Homeland cyber division.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I like places that have variety and Panera Bread has an excellent array of various food items one can order. It gets busy especially around lunch time, their food has taste and so far I haven't been disappointed with the portion size of my orders. I recommend that anyone who is looking for great tasting food to give Panera Bread in Fremont California a try. You won't be disappointed and if you are, there's always Subway or Togos< /Review>

We love coming to Paners because it is a low key aptmosphere, not noisy, and an older age group. So it would be nice if the music was not load and low key. The tables are a lot cleaner but The staff at the cash register needs to smile more.</Text>

Horrible experience today at Mowry location. Dirty silverware twice!  Sandwiches not complete. Manager blamed it on new dishwasher and Workers having a timeline to get food out!
It was busy but NO Excuse for dirty dishes or unfinished sandwiches!</Text>

I like Panera. It’s a good place to get some quick bite and food IMO is healthy. I order rapid pick up very often from same location and recently, 3 times in a row there have been missing items. First couple times I thought no big deal, just missing small items, maybe they were busy. But the third time, They are missing one of you pick 2. I was furious and had to go back to store immediately to pick up the missing half. I was trying to justify it, thinking “maybe they were busy”, but NO. It was after 8pm and there were less than 10 customers in store and they were just messing around behind the counter, did not pick up the phone call my husband made, trying to give them a heads up to prepare the sandwich.

I was told the staff supposed to checked the order twice, and guess what, the receipt of my order on the bag “order checked by ____” was blank.  3 times in a row man, 3 times! This is what tilted me the most.

At the end, they did what they can to make it up by offering refund and pastry(appreciated). I don’t want your money Panera. Just check the damn order and mark the receipt like you supposed to. So I can truly RAPID Pickup.<//review>< Pics>

<Time>1499097249335</Time><rating>3<//rating><Text>Standard Panera with a lot of options for breakfast & lunch. Pick between bagel sandwiches, egg souffles, pastries, or a few healthier options for breakfast. Mostly sandwiches and salads for lunch. The healthy egg sandwich came on a "bagel" that kind of tasted like cardboard - I might just opt for the normal bagel sandwich next time. The egg souffle was good. Ample seating but it's freezing inside, so make sure you bring an extra layer.< /Text>< Pictures>

I ordered through the app for rapid pickup. It was not rapid. It was 15 minutes after I ordered before I got my hot chocolate and muffin. Also, there hot chocolate used to taste amazing... This one was just blah.< /Text>

The quality and service at this location has gone downhill over the last couple years.  Just now we placed an order a day in advance and when we arrived to pick it up we were told "Oh, we ran out of that this morning."  Yes, they had what we reserved but sold it.

And the bathrooms are filthy and not supplied.< /review>

This is my second stop at a Panara, the last was in Albuquerque, NM. The food is delicious and I think a great value while traveling. I had the 2 items lunch and picked a bowl of summer corn chowder and half a steak and white cheddar panini. I also got a little coconut macaroon for later. My lunch also came with an apple. Everything was fantastic, really good soup. The panini could have had more meat to fill the wonderful bread but was more than enough for me. I will continue to stop at Panara 's for a safe delicious food choice.< /Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><rate>1<//rate><Text>I have never ever posted a review for any place but this is getting ridiculous. The past 4 times I have went in my orders have been messed up. The first time, I ordered a turkey and avocado BLT, but it had no bacon, no avocado, and no mayo. That just makes absolutely no sense. So after driving all the way home to find out my order my messed up, I have to drive back to get it fixed. Then, it took 20 minutes to get a new sandwich that was messed up AGAIN. So whatever, I go back today after 3 fails and I was missing a sandwich in my rapid pickup, had food I didn't even order, and I paid extra for the tortellini alfredo with chicken and of course I get to work today and there's no chicken OR ALFREDO SAUCE. I'm literally so baffled at that this keeps happening to me. And if it has happened to me 4 times, who knows how many other people this happened to. Panera is pretty pricey too so the fact that my stuff keeps getting messed up is a straight waste of money and time.<//Text>< Name>

<review>The only reason I didn't give 1star, is because food is good.  I ordered you pick two and instead came out as 2 individual items.  Showed manager that wasn't billed correctly and asked to credit the different.  Refused.  I'm at Panera 3-4 times a week and have introduced many people to their restaurant.  Apparently, client appreciation is subject to their mood.  Other Paneras I have been to are great.  Wouldn't go back to this one, unless no choice.  Customer service lacking.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I ordered quite a few items for to-go today. When I picked up, I noticed that size of sandwich was half and salad was missing.
You have to be careful or you lose.
And then I asked then to fix the order and they missed my sandwich again. Two times in a day.
Looks this is common at this location.
Never visiting this location. May be Panera bread itself.</review>

they were out of every soup except black bean, and had only honey wheat bread. cashier was extremely rude and refused to take order despite it being 20 minutes till closing. If you're in the mood for bread and soup go to boudins its right around the corner<//review>

Tell employees it is done in otherwise you'll get a to go cup. Apples aren't cored when cut so there's waste. Be explicit when ordering to prevent unusual outcomes.< /text>

<Text>I like the quality of the food but the service is never satisfying especially the people who does the prep work.

When the order is not ready for too long or they forget something, they give a sour loom instead of apologizing.

I hope they learn how to treat the customers properly.<//Text>< pics>

Panera Bread has a clean entry, and you can see the many offerings in the large display case immediately.
I ordered a cinnamon crunch bagel and my daughter ordered a bacon and egg bagle.
Both bagles were warmed nicely, and were brought to our table by server
The service and the staff were efficient and staff seemed busy cleaning, serving their clientele.
The ladies restroom was clean enough, and there is a large parking lot to park nearby.</Review>

Unusually bad. I love the souffle for breakfast. This times, it was mostly bread with very little egg or ingredients. Seems that they are skimping on this item.
Also, the counter server has no business being in customer service. She stood with a blank stares of impatience. She did not confirm anything we ordered and got some of it wrong.
Hoping this is not a trend.</Text>

I like Panera Bread, but this location is understaffed. They really need to spend the money and hire some more people; otherwise customers will turn around and leave when they see the long line and one person working behind the counter.</Text>

While my broccoli cheddar soup and Mac and Cheese is always amazing they seem to skip out on some of their sandwiches when they're busy and don't put 100% effort into it. With that being said even though they can forget to sometimes cut the steak for your sandwich, or panini your panini, they always have great customer service and have no problem fixing your issue....so long as you didn't eat it.<//Text>

<Text>I was not blown away by the food or the service. The nice atmosphere inside is heavily diminished when while waiting for our order we overhear staff discussing how many more days they will continue using produce two of them described as spoiled. The manager seemed unperturbed and informed them to keep using it for a few more days, just put plastic wrap over it. The conversation is off putting enough when you're NOT waiting for food from that particular establishment.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The absolute worst branch of Panera I've visited. Dirty floors, tables and bathrooms. Employees are often clueless and/or lazy, though most are friendly. The food can come out not only slowly but low-quality: dry, hard, and missing ingredients or under-portioned to the point that compared to other Panera locations, this one seems like an unrelated establishment.<//text>

The food came quickly other than that I was very disappointed in how the overall look and cleanliness of the resturant was ive never encountered such a dirty Panera restaurant ever and the thing is I could see if they were busy but they weren't. Also just a bit of advice for the cleaning crew please wipe the window sills! Please keep the beverages like the tea and juice filled I was there for over 30 minutes and the ice tea was empty! Come in Panera you can do better!<//text><gmapID>0x808fc085e8e00d5b:0x4998c03cee874fae< /gmapID>< response>

Panera is one of the best places to hang out in Fremont.  I often use it to meet business friends, as it has Wi-Fi and is much less crowded than Starbucks or Peets.  Plus the food is way better than either of those places, so it's a great place to meet for lunch.<//Text>

They never pick up a call. I called them to cancel a food order that I placed thru app, after trying to reach them on phone for more than 20 mins, I just gave up..
The food and waiters are good as always.</review>

It's a typical Panera. Standard food, but the service can be spotty during peak times. Tables often are not clean, parking can be very challenging -- there is a common parking lot but during peak periods it is usually full (plan to wait and circle for about 10-15 minutes).< /text>

<Text>Worst Experiance ever ,waited 40 minuites for a Sandwich for my kid who came from school and i went to get the sandwich,the young girl at the Regester was extremly slow and took 10 mintes for the order .it has been a Very Bad Experiance since last six months and nobody cares.
Just say you are not able to do coustmer service and we canall go to Sourdough Bodin we have a choice .
i would recommed not to go there or if you have a lot of time 2 hours to get a sandwich go for it.
and to top it off i ordered 2 sandwitches and two soups i got 2 sandwich and 1 soup.< /Text><Name>tony singh<//Name><pics>None< /pics><userid>111006100549272028372</userid><rating>1< /rating>< GmapID>
