First time visiting. Got a ham kids sandwich which included a cookie and applesauce, half turkey and half bbq chicken. All fresh ingredients. Very friendly staff. Nice lunch, not bad for under $20 bucks at all and they gave us each a cookie too! Will definitely be back again...<//text>

When the people ahead of me tried to pay with thier card suddenly the system was down. She gave them thier 25 order for free since the sandwiches were made. My sandwich  was also made but she told me I had to go to the bank at the end of the strip mall and get cash to pay for my sandwich. I told her I wasn't going to go payb5 bank fees for a 10 sandwich unless they were going to deduct that from the price of my sandwich. She stated she could not do that. I told her then she might as well eat it herself. I will never dine here again.<//review>

If I could rate this place 0 stars then I would! the lady who did my sandwich today  was clearly not in the mood and was upset. Very rude staff and didn’t even make the sandwich how I wanted it especially since I’m paying 10+ for a sandwich.  I won’t be coming back here again.<//text>

If you are looking for a good cheap sandwich.... This isn't it. Just kinda underwhelming and bland. Nothing special. Why is it called my pickle if that don't give out pickles. They give you cookies on the side. And my cookies were hard and old.</Review>

I love the food here and the service is usually excellent. Just today, I went in to pick up an online order on my way my home from work my fiance put in. I asked them if he had bought chips and the woman said no, have a good day, and I left. We just sat down to eat 2 hours later and yes, he did buy chips. My reciept wasn't in the bag, but he pulled up the confirmation email and he paid for chips. That's $4 down the drain. Definitely going to question them from now on.< /Review>

<Text>Good food. Staff is always friendly.
It's too bad the parking lot is a mad house at lunchtime. Security guards for the other shops will stop you from parking if you are not shopping there. Other drivers could care less if you just saved their life, they will cut you off in a heartbeat!!!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x8090419fdc1ad931:0x7087362df389d767</gmapID></record>

Today was my first experience with Mr. Pickles anywhere and we were  in Manteca Calif.  and I was quite surprised a definite noche up from subway or Togo’s.  First I was able to have my sandwich on bread choice or rolls and I chose marbled Rye which was so fluffy and fresh.  We live near the Castro Valley one and have never stopped but gone by it so today out of town we tried one I can not recommend it any higher than I am you too will be surprised like us.  Service excellent and the freshest sandwich I have had in a long time and The Tuna was excellent.</review>

<review>I love this place. If I could I'd eat here once a day. I have yet to get a sandwich I didn't like. My favorite sandwiches are tuna and pastrami. Just to let you know I don't eat everybody's tuna but their is real good, and talking about good pastrami.  Their's is the best I've had. Other places I would name has too much fat and not enough meat.

The Mr. Pickles in Manteca is the best sandwich shop I've ever had the pleasure of dining at. The  food is always completely fresh and the staff are genuinely good people. You can tell the staff all love their jobs because they remember the people they see around and are always kind. Every last one of em deserve a raise..  Just sayin< /text>

<review>Flavorless, the only thing that stood out was the bell pepper. I asked for garlic sauce and mustard didn’t have either on my sandwich. Unfortunately I got it to go. For a sandwich shop named Mr. Pickles I would have expected more than two on my sandwich.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

She was so nasty to the young employees I wanted to put my fist in her mouth to shut her up.  When she came in she expected 6 free sandwiches.  I would he told the to go to subway and would have given her $20.00 just to leave.  Customer service isn't an easy job.  I pray that the lady comes back reincarnated as a mouse and she gets snagged on a glue trap.<//text>< pictures>

Was not impressed with sandwiches. Was our first time there and won't go back. We did not really care for the flavor of food.<//Text>

Simply put Assenti's is the epitome of a great family tradition. They have a vast selection of imported Italian groceries, and some of the best fresh pasta anywhere. The best part of the experience is the people; Luigi and Roberto are very cool, carrying on the business started by their parents.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>A wonderful place to get fresh pasta.  After you've had fresh pasta, it's hard to go back to the dried stuff supermarkets sell.  It's certainly more expensive than dried pasta, but it's well worth the price.

One of the store clerks told me that the fresh pasta can last a week out of the freezer, or much longer in the freezer.  He swears that even after it's been frozen, he can't tell the difference in quality.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I wish these guys would ship !! Every time I come to town I have to stop by my favorite Italian store. The quality of the pasta is outstanding. Anyone who grew up on Italian food knows there is nothing like home made pasta. Assenti’s does it right and deserves 6 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//text>

<Review>The absolute best fresh pasta around. When my husband and I are indulging in a delicious Italian meal,  Assenti's is our ingredient supplier. The store owner is always so friendly and helpful. Love this little local gem. Feels like a small town in a big city when you step through the door.<//Review>< pictures>

I tried a slice of margarita.  By "slice" they mean like a 1/4 of a pizza! The tomato sauce was the perfect mix of sweet and savory.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Assenti’s is the best place to get fresh pasta in San Diego! They have a wide variety made daily, and you can also get frozen ravioli to take home. It’s a $10 min on CC, so make sure you have cash if you’re spending less than that. Their sauces are also great and so is their olive tapenade. Definitely stop in if you’re looking for the best of the best pasta in SD! They supply to many of the restaurants in the area, too.< /Review>

Louis is fabulous. Very helpful and answered our many, many questions. You can stop by and pick up all you need for a lovely Italian dinner, except salad.

They make fresh pasta, both for several local restaurants and for the public. I came away with a lemon basil fettuccine that was yummy. In fact, I liked it so much better than regular boxed pasta that I'm going to try my hand at making it.

I wouldn't go there from Las Vegas just to buy their pasta, but if I'm in the general area (within 25 miles) I'll plan to stop in.< /Review>

Darling shop. Staff clearly has regulars that they dote on but it is a little uncomfortable when you drive from N. Orange County to stop in and you are not as welcomed as the regulars. I did buy some of their fresh pasta. It was delicious.</review>

I've been here twice now, and it will definitely be my go-to shop for Italian meal prep. Their fresh pasta is delicious though I'd suggest calling ahead first to make sure they have it in stock that day. They also have a number of packaged options that work out great. Really eager to try their frozen pastas.< /text>

<Text>Best homemade pastes and sauces for cheap. If you're cooking an Italian dinner at home, this place will have everything you need. The only negative is that parking is always a pain in little Italy. But, worth it.

<text>Husband was craving ravioli but didn't want to go out. I stopped by this adorable shop on the way home from work; parked about 1/2 block away. I grabbed a package of beef and spinach ravioli from the freezer for about $10, and 3 big housemade Italian sausages for like $7. They had lots of beautiful, freshly made pastas on display. It was hard not to buy a little bit of everything!
I served the ravioli and Italian sausage with a little marinara sauce, and my family RAVED. The texture of the pasta was firm and silky. Sausage was flavorful and not fatty or full of fillers at all.
A nice, delicious dinner for 3 at $20? You can't beat that.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Great Pasta. Guy overcharged me by accident and ran about a block and a half to give me back $10. This place is a class act.<//Text>

The authentic freshness, I felt it was an original Tuscan dish.  I was back in Sorrento tonight.  I keep it simple.  Fresh made spaghetti pasta, homemade sauce and homemade meatballs.  Simple,delicious, bellisimo.<//Text>

< Review>
This is the place to get homemade pasta by the pros. Yo can get fresh spaghetti, penne, rigatoni and more. Some of the past is flavored and some of it is plain. Don't forget to check out the freezer for pre-made ravioli and sauces. Try the cheese and spinach ravioli. Ask the brothers behind the counter how to cook it and they'll give you some good sauce suggestions.

I also get my prosciutto here. It's fresh and they have several different kinds. Try them all. They also have olives, cheese and pepperoni. Go for it. It's all good.</Review>

< Review>
My go-to pasta shop in San Diego.  Every year I make chicken Parm for christmas dinner and I come here to stock up on all my chicken farm supplies!  I love their wide selection of fresh pasta and all of the extras.  I haven't tried the sauces here yet, but if its anything like what Ive had from here than it will not disappoint! Parking is tight! But its worth the hassle!</Review>

Raul is the best! One very windy day, there was an Edison outage for much of our city. Without electricity, I couldn't open my garage door which wasn't connected to my apartment or any external door. I called maintenance to explain I had a job interview that afternoon & needed my car. Someone came out with a ton of keys but couldn't find the one that would open my garage. Raul showed up and said she can't wait and drilled out the lock! He replaced the lock and secured the door for us, during my interview.

I got the job & was so grateful, I baked him cookies and told the manager how much I appreciated his understanding the urgency of the moment. Any time we need maintenance, we're happy when Raul shows up at our door!<//text>

This place was nice when we moved in in May 2019. It was quiet, clean and our neighbors were respectful. Over the past couple months the sidewalks have become stained, there is constantly trash thrown about and our apartment vibrates randomly throughout the week from loud music (as it's doing at this very moment). The price is way too high for the standard it's at.< /review>

<text>One of the few properties that has actual humans with a friendly smile and courteous help. Sokhom was the Reserve representative and was overly helpful on every subject/inquiry we had. She was in touch every few days whether email or phone. We contacted a hand full of properties…no one even remotely close. They know the business and handle it well! Good place to visit and belong to! Highly recommend this place/experience!

Reserve at Empire Lakes is a great place to live at! First, the staff is wonderful. Stacey, the community manager, is responsive and genuinely cares about the community. I have had the chance to work with each person from the leasing team (Sokhom, Johnson, Jimmy, and Destiny), and each of them is kind and helpful. The service team is also great. The one or two service requests that I have had have been addressed quickly and professionally. There are many apartment communities in the area, however, the team here sets this community apart from any other. Second, the apartment homes here have gorgeous finishes and the layouts are spacious and unique. The kitchen is my favorite part, with an island, tons of counter space and plenty of cabinets. Third, the area and neighborhood around the community has everything one needs. It can't be beat. There is every restaurant that you can think of, and there are tons of shopping options, within walking distance. Even though there is much to do in the area, the community is still tucked away behind all of the stores and restaurants, and it is pretty quiet for the most part. I feel very at-home and comfortable at The Reserve!<//review>

This place is amazing. We’ve been here since August and absolutely love it here. Everything from applying to moving and up until now with any maintenance requests or questions for the leasing office has been so easy. I’ve mainly felt with Jimmy, from day one he has been pleasant to deal with, very professional and nice. The property is taken well of, no trash anywhere and always clean. I’d definitely recommend these apartments to anyone.</Review>

I love the staff here at The Reserve at Empire Lakes they’ve always been super respectful and professional! This morning I realized I haven’t had hot water and called the office. Destinie took my emergency work order and it took only a max of 30 minutes before a maintenance professional came to address the issue. Even with my screaming bouncy toddlers he was very polite to all of us and was able to fix our water! 😁👍🏼< /text>

<name>Cee Villa</name><review>The apartment complex itself is centrally located in the perfect area. Be aware of all the extra charges they will charge you when you move out. Don’t bother cleaning because they will charge you for that. They will also charge you for paint and carpet cleaning after living there for a year. They took my deposit and are asking for an additional $300 for BS fees. I have never been charged extra when I moved out of an apartment because I take good care of where I reside. This place is a scam. I lived at Verano in rancho and I recommend them over this place. Good luck using the amenities there because that’s a joke too.<//review></record>

<text>I've lived in these apartments for 3 years now and love them.  The maintenance staff are awesome. If ever I need something repaired, they are quick to get it done. Carlos is hilarious.  He keeps me laughing when he does any repairs for me.  He maintains complete professionalism at all times as do the others.  I highly recommend these apartments to live in. For me staying for 3 years says a lot as I don't stay longer than a year anywhere. I've been happy to call this place home as I've lived in 2 different sized units during these past three years.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Community is five star:
Moved in not to long ago and have had nothing short of a great time. The community is clean, the staff is very friendly and accommodating, the apartments are clean, I can't think of any thing negative to say!
Location is five star:
The location of these apartments is prime as well. Right next to the Mall, plenty of gyms around, easy drive to the beach and its just as easy to get to the mountains!
Safety is five star:
The community full of kind people and I haven't had any worry so far as to lack of security.</text>

My fiancé and I have lived at the Reserve for about 3 years. I can truly say that we are enjoying our time here. Sokhom and the office staff are super nice and always address any concerns, or questions we may have.

Although some residents may not be the best at cleaning up after themselves or their pets, Raul and the maintenance team take care of it right away. The property stays clean and is pretty quiet.

Also when you stay here, you accrue Equity Residential credits to use towards purchasing a home in the future. We are hoping to be home owners in the future.</review>

Three years and counting. Great place to live. The office management/ maintenance is very friendly and Ms.  Sokhum is always there when I need her. She's a pleasure to know. Keep up the good work 😊<//Text>

I have lived here for about 6 years now and I have enjoyed every minute of it. The leasing office team is very helpful and always have a smile on their faces. The maintenance team is also always on top of everything and very friendly to everyone.
There are two pools and jacuzzis to enjoy, a gym, a media room which you can rent out, a small dog park, and there’s food trucks every now and then out by the leasing office.
The location is great too you have a huge mall and SO MANY restaurants and cafes, and also a target for your general grocery needs.
In short this is the PERECT PLACE TO LIVE<//Text>

<review>My husband and I enjoy living at The Reserve.
So far we've had a positive experience.
We love living within walking distance to Target, restaurants and the Mills.

We haven't had any problems with finding parking.

Office staff has always been polite and helpful. Raul from the Maintenance Staff has also been extremely helpful, polite and professional when we reported an issue with our AC unit. He also follows up to ensure that our issue was addressed.

The only concern I have is the fact that the trash gets full really quick.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Reynaldo Rodriguez-Molina came to attend to the work order that was placed for a couple of things to be repaired.  When I added one more item to be repaired he did it with no problem.  He didn't tell me I had to put the work order in for it first,  he just took care of it.  Reynaldo is a very professional and respectful maintenance man with a very cheerful attitude.  Thank you Reynaldo for the repairs you did for us.  They were very much appreciated.<//text>

We love it here. By far the best apartments ever. Great staff and very clean. Sokhom, Stacy, Jennifer, Stan, Raul, and the rest of the team are amazing. They make you feel right at home. All of our maintenance requests get handled quickly and efficiently. Property is always looking it's best. Parking is fine. Even my visitors like coming to my home. All of the shopping centers are close. Love right by the mall. Quick access to the freeways as well. What more could I ask for.<//review>

We have lived here for about two years and honestly we love it. The entire staff is amazing any time you need something from the office staff, the Community Manager, or the maintenance team they there to help just a simple phone call or email way. They are very attentive. The property is always well maintained. Target, Ontario Mills, places to eat are right across the street just a short walk away. I would highly recommend the Reserves as it is an overall great community. It’s an amazing feeling when you walk into the office they greet you by name and great service!<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><user_name>Anasu<//user_name><Review>From the start, the people here have been misinformed and unhelpful.  This place doesn't work with their residents or their needs and will actively tow resident's cars even when paying for monthly parking.  Not to mention, it charges high prices.  Look elsewhere!

I have reached out and in one case it was slow to resolve, in the other it was refused.

That's the second time the response to reach further has been offered, and I would like to do so, what would be great is if a way to contact them would be provided along with the suggestion.< /Review><userid>103714417798179850717<//userid>< Pictures>

The Reserve at Empire Lakes is fantastic community with a management company that is built around a "Service First" mentality.  The office staff are ALWAYS available, even when you walk in and there is a lobby full of people,  you will be greeted with a smile and a professionalism that is second to none!  The maintenance team is prompt, very detailed and address any issues right away.

These folks truly live up to the motto of "MAKING THIS YOUR HOME".

Many thanks to Reserve staff!!<//text>

It doesn't stop there, the maintenance dept is very efficient, especially Raul. I've never had to wait 48 hours for a service order, even when placing it online, they come right away which I love.

Lived here 3 years.  I recently moved out to my own home.  This place is great.   The staff is friendly and attentive.   The maintenance responds quickly.  My apartment was beautiful and updated.   Now that they started using parking permits I was able to find parking when I came home.   Sad to leave.</Review>

This apartment complex is great. My apartment has a nice layout and the  bedroom is pretty big - have a king size bed! Love the kitchen and that there is in unit washer/dryer. There are two pools in the complex and they both have BBQs which is awesome. Plus, you can walk to Ontario Mills mall and shop, you can walk to Target, you can pretty much walk and get tons of food/shopping.<//Text>

I lived there for a year and a half. It was wonderful. I had a great corner location close to the pool. Office staff was always so nice! They have events and food trucks set up for the community! Sokhom was the best! She set me up with the apartment and checked in on me often, and always made sure I was happy with where I was living. I'm sad I moved out but it was for a good reason, we bought a home! If for any reason we have to go back to apartment living, the Reserve is my first choice!< /Review>

< Review>
This apartment complex is very beautiful however for $1650, everything in the apartment are substandard and cheap. The interior needs updating. Not sure who the builder is, but the walls are paper then. I can hear people's conversations, music, and snoring when my house is very quiet. I was displeased seeing a couple of car getting broken into, and there's constant blackouts for hours which has caused my food to go bad several times. Other than that everything else is pretty nice. Great location with plenty of stores around. I continue to see the prices in rent go up but dont have the basics to be considered as a luxery apartment which is a huge problem.<//Review>

Leasing agent sokhom is great to work with. She made our move out simple and smooth.

The theee stars are for the community.
As for the community itself, it’s been getting worse and worse over the past few years. We had our garage broken into and items stolen TWICE. mailboxes were being broken into. Parking passes for spots are a joke. And the rent continues to go up, with the community getting worse. It was time to leave.</review>

< review>
This property is not disability accessible, hardly anyone leaves the first floor. Noise can be a issue if you live in between the alleys, the neighbors can be disrespectful and unfriendly but that is Southern California mentality, Los Angeles, specifically IE not the nicest people. Please be aware that the area is not great in Education and does not strive to be. Services for children lack as well.

As for the apartment itself the complex is clean except trash areas where neighbors can be messy and disrespectful of how to properly throw away trash and pick up after their dogs.  Office staff is nice and informative to their policies anything more specialized beyond the contract it is best to contact corporate office.</review>

PICE: High, this is Rancho Cucamonga.
LOCATION: Convenient!
SAFETY: Good. Some robberies of course, like everywhere. Just be smart; be aware of your surrounding, don't forget to close/lock your door and garage (I have seen people leave it open and they have many things inside, of course somebody will steal). I have left mine open by accident many times by not clicking well, but mine is empty.
STAFF: Great! I complain and they solve it! I am including the office staff, maintenance staff and cleaning staff; all very nice and trustworthy.
PARKING: A bit limited for guests, but residents have reserved spaces if registered. Your car will get towed if you don't follow the rules...duh... This is to respect those who do!
COMMUNITY: Well like everywhere; there are those who respect and are considerate and those who aren't. For the most part I would say most people are great. There are some who smoke (cigarettes or weed) knowing this is a smoke-free complex... I have indicated to the staff this once, specifying the apartment number and they solved it, I no longer inhale that substance through my apartment window...
MAIL: Love the package room, I have not gotten anything stolen considering it is a shared space for residents.
NOISE: At least in my area, it is good. I am in front of the pool, so on weekends there are families that are enjoying their time and will be loud, for the most part this is rare. I can hear footsteps, obviously... So if you aren't tolerant, choose the third floor.
POOL AREA/GYM: Clean! The cleaning staff cleans daily! Thank goodness because I am obsessive with this.
EVENTS: They organize nice events or food trucks to come occasionally; that is nice.

CONCLUCION: Love it.< /Text>

The apartments are nice don't get me wrong I really like my place the only downside is the people that live in this apartment complex are so nasty! They don't like to pick up after themselves they leave their trash piled up outside their front door for days on end. Oh and if they drop something like food or a bag of garbage they will let it sit there without any thought to pick it up. It's pretty gross who would have thought grown adults wouldn't have the common decency to pick up after themselves it amazes me.</review>

<Review>I thoroughly enjoy living here at The Reserve at Empire Lakes.  One of the things that stands out the most for me is the Service Team.  They are efficient, friendly and professional.  They went over and above when fixing my garbage disposal & bathroom sink.  The office staff go over and above and are willing to help with even things like accepting packages. The community is conveniently located near restaurants and the Ontario Mills Mall.  Residents even get a discount at 4th & Mill!  So far my favorite place to live!  I love calling The Reserve our home!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

So we're do I start I moved in here roughly around April of this year and to me 2 months in living here I experience having issues with my washer that kept over floating so around the 3rd time is when it flooded the most leading from the wash room to the hall way to my bathroom bedroom and living room so had to call emergency services and the maintenance worker that came was obviously upset having to come in and fix the issue and I get it I would be upset bean woken up but hey that's your job to resolve these issues so they had to tear out all the padding and lift up a good amount of the carpet to keep these blowers going for about over 2 days so imagining how much my light bill went up so the office was able to credit us an amount but they go based off two bills worth so obviously the cheapest one so they don't pay a lot which is bull to me. So now we're dealing with people upstairs bean loud from during the day till late nights talking 2am-4am like they don't sleep now we went to the office around 5 times and called security as well now the security here is a joke the first time we called made a report they never sent it over to the office or came to our apt the second time they came but don't think they went upstairs to talk to them and obviously the 3rd and so fourth finally made there way to the office and gave a report but even calling them or talking to the office people I fell like there all lazy we can tell them these issues over and over again but I fill and they can tell us all day they talked to them but I fell the people upstairs don't give to cares at all and supposedly the noise travels from one side of an apt to ours since we all charge walls but I find that hard to believe but yea my experience here has bean horrible won't renew here again oh and another note people will park in your cover car port that don't live here so for what I'm paying here in rancho I rather move back to redlands and pay less and wouldn't of bean this bad

Sorry for long story but yea be wise before u move here<//Text>

< Review>
I am a recent tenant to The Reserve at Empire Lakes. My move in experience was wonderful with Sokum!! The experience from my tour of the location to the actual move in date was smooth and comfortable. The staff including Sokum, Jennifer and Rylan was very inviting, warm and informative. My encounter with Stan the maintenance Supervisor was also just great.  I can say that I am really happy I made the decision to move here! So far I am enjoying the move and the apartment complex. The neighbors seem friendly. My dogs are comfortable with the nice, clean and large dog area. I do wish the parking was better, the garage is a bit small so sometimes parking in a stall is quicker so parking sucks but that is a small inconvenience!!! I did see a sketchy gentlemen that did not live in the complex one night that seemed as if he followed my daughter and I out of the complex as we were walking our dogs, he attempted to engage in a conversation with my minor daughter, I quickly put that to an end. He left walking down the street! So I say that to say I hope the security is available and present as the tow truck is at the complex!!!!< /Review>

< Review>
My first day I moved in was a day from you know what! First I will start with us being pretty much rushed in the office to our new apartment. The walk through was quick and the condition of the apartment was overall ok but there was some big misses like yellow stains on the bathroom floors. My refrigerator has a really bad damage piece underneath the ice maker. Some of the cabinets have damage. Now I'm seeing and noticing other things like the closet rack is breaking apart and my sliding door is coming apart from the door.  I  i hwas really excited to move in my first day but the worst thing happened MY CAR GOT TOWED!!! I went inside for less than 5 minutes and I came out and the neighbor was telling me that they took my car! I called the tow company and they were rude. I had to pay 200 dollars for me to get my car out. It would of been more if I didn't call them right away. It would of been almost $400.00! Crazy! At the end of it all it is what it is but the worst part of it was the manager Stacy I called and spoke with Ashley in the office she said she would address it and email the manager Stacy however I never got or received a call back from her. I finally call the office back on Thursday which this happened on Saturday and spoke to Jennifer a leasing agent she gave the message to Stacy and she finally called me back. If I would have not called them who knows how long it would have took her to call me back and address the problem. The rest of the staff is ok but the manager Stacey is rude and speaks to you as if she is better than you. Oh and when moving in they didn't even show me where my mail box was. Very unorganized company or staff. Not a good way to run a community. I would say the whole company isn't bad I lived at their sister property centre club and they are 10 times better and treat there community with respect plus there just as nice with cheaper rent! Think wisely before you move here.< /Review>

<user_name>Jeff Ray II< /user_name><time>1466459173222</time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My wife and I have been here for almost 3 years. The community is in a GREAT location (close to the mall, target, kohls, dozens of restaurants all within walking distance) and it continues to get better and better every year with upgrades around the community. I love that it is also a gated community which was important for my wife. The staff are ABSOLUTELY amazing from Stacy to Jennifer, Rylan, Sokham all who great you with a smile and treat you with the utmost respect. The community also has a home builders credit that i would recommend as this is how we are buying our first new build home in Murrieta. I will miss this place but recommend anyone looking for an apartment to come here. You wont be disappointed!!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

The truth is its a horrible place to live...I had to call the police when a degenerate wandered on the "private" property and was banging on my door in the middle of the night multiple times over an hour while my husband was away and I was alone with my toddler and they just stood there trying to break down my door until police arrived. Lets not forget the men that raid the dumpsters late at night and scared my nephew when taking the trash out and now they dont want to visit their aunts house anymore. There is no parking EVER and the towing company stalks anyone who parks incorrectly. The mail boxes have been vandalized and broken into at least twice and mail has been stolen. Tenants fill their garages full of crap even though they arent supposed to and their is a insect problem and adds to the parking problem. They are going to raise my rent after one year by approx. $130 and if you were banking on a month to month...it was going to be $2406 a month...for an apartment!!! Save yourself some energy, hassle, and money and look elsewhere!!!<//review>< Pictures>

Old Navy has a great deal on pajamas, scarfs and gloves.  Jeans are on sale with a variety of long for those who are tall. Workers are friendly and helpful. Definitely will go back to this location.</Text>

Clothes used to be main stream, cute and sporty. Now most clothes remind me of the clothes we wore in the 60s and 70s. But more dull and frazzled looking. I hope it is a passing fad. Although it has been about 2 years with this sad style. I used to love this store. I will keep checking in and hoping...< /Review><rating>3< /rating>< Pics>

They have a large selection. They were having a big sale today. We picked up several outfits for our family. Found a cute pair of shoes from clearance for one of the kids.  I have not been there for a while and i am glad we stopped in the store was clean and we got great service.<//Review>

<review>This store is very organized. Fitting rooms are clean. I was looking for size 6 jeans and I couldn't find it. Finally I realized that the manikin was wearing my size. I asked the sales associate if I could take those jeans and they did. They were very friendly and undressed the manikin. I was able to try the jeans on. I was very greatful that they went above and beyond.</review>< Resp>

No customer service, didn't even get a hello, store had maybe two other shoppers in there. Definitely more employees than customers. Online had prices like 10 bucks for shorts, in store they were 20+. For boys khakis. Pretty ridiculous. Wasn't happy but I'll be back because Old Navy is usually better than this.</Review>

I haven't been to Old Navy for a long time. They had a great sale going on today. My daughter was able to find a very cute jean jacket that fits and she has room to grow in it for a very reasonable price. My sister in law was able to find two pairs of flip flops after looking several places to find the right size. I will go back there again when I have a need for clothes.</Review>

Location is OK always very busy. The selection at this store is much better than most however in the area. I would recommend visiting location in morning during week and evenings on weekend. It seems to be one of the busier locations.<//text>

<Review>I love all the great prices at Old Navy, I had a mixed experience here. I searched the store for the perfect matching Christmas PJs for my family, and couldn't find the exact match for the baby and settled on getting her the closest thing. As I was leaving the store I saw her size in the correct matching pattern on display. When I asked the team member if I could trouble her to get that one she was annoyed and rudely called over the radio demanding someone to bring clothes to redress the mannequin that the clothes are being taken off of. She never said sure you can have them. . Just was clearly upset at my request. However, the sweet lady at the register helped me exchange my prior purchase for the new one, and even lowered the price of the new pjs to make an even exchange. Go to the old navy just dont ask for items on display.<//Review>< gmap_id>

I am not the normal, fashionista Old Navy customer. But they have some reasonably priced clothing for my teenage grandson. But their checkout procedures are the same I've experienced for the last 30 years and extremely SLOW. It was the Christmas rush and customers lined up in their Disney lines. I don't fault them for placing displays to catch shoppers for binge items. However, many of them weren't even visible because the length of time made customers reconsider the amount of items and the bins and displays were covered with go-backs. I can't even imagine how much money they lost in revenue lying in those bins.< /Review>

I was hoping to exchange maternity clothes recently purchased online.  Unfortunately the store did not carry any maternity clothes.  It took over 30 minutes to get thru the line and to return the items. Every item would not ring up and the cashier had to type in everything one by one. It was a large waste of time.  I purchased 11 items online.  Only 2 could be reordered.</Review>

Reasonable prices, although I usually shop in the clearance section. Great for buying cheap but good quality (general) athletic clothes, such as running shorts, but don't expect to find sports specific athletic clothing. There are frequent sales as well, so keep an eye out. If you have an Old Navy card, you can earn "style cash".<//review>< Gmap_id>

I really like this old navy but checking out takes forevvvvvver. I don’t know if it’s the system or the employees but I swear I always have to wait in line for at least 10 minutes. The other thing is that if you are going to look for clearance, good luck because that section is a total mess. It’s still a good place to go for cheap clothes though.</text>

< review>
Their pricing is competitive, but their customer service is questionable. Sales associates should stay clear of prospective buyers, especially when they (not only) lack enthusiasm, but also fall short of being cordial. Customers should feel comfortable shopping in stores, but when they're met with disgruntled or unhappy employees, it makes shopping online more sensible. It's experiences like this, that justify self-checkouts.<//review>

< review>
I had the absolute WORST experience with a manager at this location. His name is Joaquin. I purchased two dresses, one for myself and one for my daughter. Both dresses were 50% off, however, when I went home I realized my dress was rung up at full price:$29.99. I went back into the store today to let them know of their mistake and I had the displeasure of dealing with Joaquin. He told me they couldn't honor the price because there was no way to verify that I was telling the truth. Basically calling me a liar. I then showed him the price it should've been since it was the correct price online... Still said he wouldn't honor the sale price. I ended up returning both mine and my daughter's dresses. Absolute garbage. I will no longer be shopping there at that location.</review>

Good bargains today but they didn't have any shopping carts. I'm disabled and wasn't able to carry a lot of things that I had planned to buy.  Off my list of places to shop for school clothes.< /Text>

<text>The sizing is so inconsistent that a 30 inch waist in the exact style and size could mean 27 inch or 33 inch. Some were so tight that they couldn't be buttoned while others were hanging off of the hips. To make it worse, this store is so disorganized that it's impossible to find your size (which you need to try on 3 or 4 of the same exact pair to actually get the right size) and style. Half of the jeans in the style section that I needed were the in the wrong section. When an employee asked if he could help me, I later asked if he could help me sort the jeans so that I could find the right size and style. He said, "Okay." And then he walked away never to return. I waited ten minutes while continuing to search and finally gave up. I went to the mall instead where the customer service was impressive at both stores that I visited.< /text>< pictures>

Not at all satisfied eith my visit.
Suggest a couple of benches outside store for people with disabilities and seniors to sit while waiting  for ride. (Elderly ladies sitting on damp flower pots). Check out lines long and wait too long. Not enough cashiers during this season.(cashier was helpful and pleasant)..merchandise sizes hard to find..islands messy.< /Review>

The lady who checked us out looked so bored and I don't believe she said one word to me. She seemed so unhappy and appeared to be just going through the motions, just doing the absolute minimum to get a paycheck. This was my first and probably my last time going to an Old Navy.< /Review>

No one likes to see if there are other sizes in the back everyones quick answer every time I ask is "everythings  on the floor" nice way to say I'm Lazy and just don't feel like looking for you, customer service sucks management has tought the employees how to get out of providing good customer service, if management does it why can't they.< /Text>

<text>I hated there service(not all of them), some seemed snobby and I heard one of them say something about me that I didn't like, and they don't have lots of cargo pants no more like they use too, now "old navy" don't have much options for me to pick from, this use to be my type of store...but not so much now.< /text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Excellent store what I still do not understand jajaj is how it works the discounts always have descunto the clothes. And you end up paying a high total. But the quality of the clothes is good good all the merchandise

(Original)
Exelente tienda lo que todavia no entiendo jajaj es como trabaja los descuentos siempre tiene descunto la ropa. Y terminas pagando un total alto. Pero la calidad de la ropa es buena bueno toda la mercancia</review>

The best part is that unlike 'a major competitor' who once maintained a 99 cent per item inventory, Dollar Tree has stayed true to their name - "DOLLAR Tree' as in items cost A SINGLE DOLLAR.

I don't remember the last time I left any restaurant without finishing my meal. I don't think I ever did that until today. This was my meal and that how I left. It was so salty that it was not edible. I added a cup of hot water, but still salty. It had good amount and variety of ingredients, but broth was horrible. This is my favorite dish when I go to Korean Chinese restaurants. It is impossible to mess up this bad. Maybe Mr Paik should visit these restaurants in SolCal.</text>

It used to be great...not anymore. I know they’re busy but the food taste horrible! Jjam bbong was super salty and Jja jang myon was too greasy. I love the Tang su yook but the portion is very small. I decided not to visit again. :-(</Text>

The food here is full of spices and the flavor is immaculate. They give the best service and the plates are huge enough for two people. There menu is a bit limited, but the quality and taste of each one is fabulous! 10/10<//review>

Really nice and clean location. I ordered the Black bean noodles, they were good. They do not sell drinks but they do have a vending machine inside the restaurant, and there is also a 85 bakery next door. (Seated outside by the fireplace)</Text>

Last evening was the worst meal I've ever had at this place.  Chef must be sleeping. We've been here before many times, but yesterday was totally different.    Ordered BOKKUM noodle and sweet and sour pork.  Sauce for noodle was too sweet and there wasn't much of vegetables. Sweet and sour was too sweet, no sour taste.   S&S sauce was so thick,
chopsticks were able to stand still, too much starch. I thought in the Army, they used to starch pants hard so it could stand by itself.      NO kidding.   It was terrible yesterday.< /text>

It's a shame this place isn't higher up on the map chain. You got to rep. Naw I mean? Credit where credit due, dude. Noodle it on. Come to California not for the beaches. Not th sunlight. But this joint. It's hoping you get the black noodles. It's hoping you get the sweet crispy pork. Eat with the yellow salty radish. Just ask for it. Their service is on the rocking roll. Super fast too, like mad ups to the manager of this place. Well-run. They got it on lock down. Marvel at their systematic tray movement. Seriously, you won't get bored even waiting because they got glass panels! You can watch them for days just fire. Wok-for-hire here. The letters:E.A.T.</text>

<userid>115620145790219879247</userid><Text>Here is self service, so you need to order at the counter and when they call your last two digit# on the receipt you need to pick it up from the counter.

HongKong BanJum which is famous for JjamBbong in S. Korea was started by JongWon Baek.

There are a lot of branches in S.Korea and recently, he has been trying to expand more chains in US.

The Broth for JjamBbong made by sea foods and fresh vegitables with hot peppers, so the soup has a hearty and spicy flavor.

When you eat JjamBbong, try to eat with TangSuYuk which is sweet and sour pork.

It would be perfect matching.

There is JjaJangMyun which is black-bean-sauce noodles but it is a little bit sweet.

When you want to eat spicy soup or try to relieve a hangover, please try to order JjamBbong.

I 've been following hostess of this restaurant, so I know well about the
history of this branch.

I met her first time in food court in
Freshia Market at Garden Grove a few years ago, when she opened it.

I really loved to eat JjamBbong at that time.
However, Freshia Market was bankrupt, so they could not continously do
the business there.

After that, she opened new branch
at Arirang Market at Fullerton,
so I started to visit there to eat JjamBbong.

Finally, she opened new branch at
Village Circle on Beach at Buena Park
which is nearby my house
and located in independent building.

Anyway, I been following her to
eat this delicious JjamBbong.
Now I can enjoy it without any
concern of closing.

Try to eat JjamBbong which is
spicy and delicious.

You will love it when you are addicted
spicy food.< /Text>< GmapID>

My family and I like the food here rather than any other same chains because of the quality of their food. We keep coming here every time we feel like having Korean style noodles.  It costs a little bit more than the ones I had been to in Korea, but still good for the living standard here in America is higher than Korea as well<//text>

Not impressed with this place. Big portions but not worth the finishing because it wasn’t even all that good. Did like the fact that you could eat outside and it was clean.< /Review>

The soup and fried noodles had exactly the same ingredients. Free iced water and ginger. Quick place for a meal but nothing special. Huge portions.< /Review>

The dough is made fresh and the noodles are stretched to order.  The broth is delicious.  You won't find anything else like it in the area.< /text>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Paik's Noodle is in the H Mart plaza right next to 85 Degrees Bakery.
It's a small eatery, but there's an outdoor patio with plenty of seatings.
It's a "fast food" style restaurant. You place order and pay at the counter.
When the food is ready they'll call your number to pick up the food.

Dr. P ordered jjamppong - spicy noodle soup with seafood.
I had a bite. It was really spicy.

Jajangmyeon was very good.
Love the chewy noodle with the black bean sauce.
There are pork and tons of vegetables in the sauce.

Great place for fast and cheap Korean noodle!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Definitely my favorite place to have Jjajangmyeon and Jjajangbab. Tang su yuk is really decent too. Jjajangbab comes w Jjambbong soup which is filled w veggies, squid and pork pieces.< /text>

<Text>Came here early so had no problem with parking or customers . So we tried a variety of items from the non spicy wings, jajangmyeon, tangsuyuk, and gunmandu. Everything was a first for us , so not sure how things are suppose to taste . But for us it looked good and tasted ok . The store itself was super clean and food came out very quick .  The menu would been great if they had a little explanation of what the dishes were . So now to customer service , I asked the lady at the counter if I can have a to-go box . She then gives me a container for soup , and I was trying to explain I need a box . I pointed to box and she slammed another soup container . I had 3 dishes to put and didn't want them, smushed all together . So I tried to have my friend ask for a box , and she told her no . I posted the picture of my food items that I wanted to put in a box . Hopefully next time others would not have this problem , am hoping their management would speak to their employee  regarding giving away to-go containers . Other than that experience, the food was ok .< /Text></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) It is unfortunate that I can't taste Baek Jong-won's blazing champon and jajang.
It is not much different from Jjajangmyeon and Jjambbong, which are roughly produced in large quantities.

Very good store for children. A lot of variety of clothes available. They have a reward point system so if you buy frequently you can save more. Most of the time they have a separate section on sale and it’s pretty cheap too. You can find good quality clothes at this store<//Review>

Staff was friendly and the selection was good.  Staff was willing to work with you on getting the best deal on clothing.  Store was clean, and items were easy to find.<//Review>

<Text>My old pair broke so I went in for an exam and glasses and they were done in less than one hour.  A lot of styles to choose from.  The place was super clean and practiced social distancing guidelines.  The staff are friendly and very efficient.  I am coming back here for my next pair!  Highly recommend this place.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Also, had help with contact fitting with perfect instructions on how to place and remove them! They were very patient with me, despite multiple failed attempts! I highly recommend their services and would visit again in a heartbeat! Please make them your primary team if you want to ensure optimal vision health!!!< /Review>< pics>

The appointment process was easy, they even called to confirm. Once there I was immediately taken care of. I'm very grateful to all the staff! Everyone was super polite.</text>

<review>Great experience with a wide selection of frames to choose from.
Staff was very knowledgeable Brandon helped me and my wife on the floor selecting a few pairs of frames.

Great experience. Doctor really cares. Pay the little extra to check your retinas, it’s worth it—don’t be cheap when it comes to the health of your eyes. Because of this, my regular doctor was alerted of another health issue because of what was noticed in my retinal eye exam; can’t say thank you enough.
Staff here is so professional & friendly. Place is super sanitized, so no worries about safety protocols either. I won’t go anywhere else now.<//review>

Had a great experience with Dr. Song. She was really informative and kind with her service. Haven’t had an eye exam in years and I just happen to walk in and was greeted immediately. The stuff is really attentive and awesome! Thanks guys! I would highly recommend going here! They also have great frames and affordable prices !</text>

Really clean, really nice. The Dr. song was super informative and very patient with me. She explained everything and the contacts she provided are on point. I’ve been to other places where the doctor seemed to have struggle, they didn’t get the prescription right the first 2 attempts. I’m glad the Dr.  was able to provide me with some the first go around. Would recommend.<//Review>

If I could give a zero star, I would. To say that I am LIVID is the understatement of the century. The doctor was fine but the entire rest of my visit was awful. I will not be coming back. I want my entire medical record sent elsewhere.<//Review>

I had a great experience buying my son’s first car. Sammy, my sales rep, was kind, understanding, and went the extra mile for me. Although there was an issue with the assistant manager, Sammy got the right people involved, and got me the deal I was promised. I will absolutely be back to purchase another car from him! If you want a superior sales rep that’ll do everything he can to make buying a car a great experience, please ask for Sammy!!!!<//Review>

<Review>They give new meaning to the term under promise and over deliver. By ever measure, they exceeded my expectations. I'm 57 and have been getting my eyes examined, buying and getting fitted for eyes glasses and contact lenses since I was 16 years old. So it's not new to me. I know what to expect.

Dr Song was excellent. Thoughtful, knowledgeable, considerate and she wrote what seems to be a perfect prescriptions for both eye glass progressive lenses and and contact lenses.  My new glasses were ready for in one hour.... yes, one hour! My contact lens prescription was not in stock, so they gave me a very close trail set (of 5 pairs) to hold me over until my 90 day order arrived ... in a day!

I expected to pay the same certain amount that (ballpark) for the exam, the frames, the fitting an the contact lenses. I was wrong... because of a remarkable discount that was being offered... it brought the total down from $750 for my glasses fitted for me to $500. Wow! That was the one thing that was unexpected.

I saved so much money I could easily afford those sunglasses I had my eye on.

So, I'm a happy camper... I can see :-)

I recommend them. Indeed I do.< /Review><time>1615841998418</time><UserId.>109409324726262399520< /UserId.>< Response>

<review>Dr. Song was incredibly helpful as this was my first optometry appointment since I was a child. After being walked through the preliminary stages she explained my results and took a further dive into the health of my vision. Answered all of my questions thoroughly and even gave me some suggestions. Made me feel comfortable and advised what was to come as once I get glasses. She also made a plan for my future vision health.</review>< pics>

<Review>I showed up for a walk-in and the first available slot was given to me. I was able to browse around and there were safety protocols in place for me to try on various frames. I was called in quickly for prep and the entire staff was friendly and engaging.

Very satisfied with the customer service and my first frames were available the same day

great experience! all of the staff was super friendly and detailed about the processes/costs (i was super worried about getting ripped off or overcharged but actually they made sure my insurance saved me as much as possible) would definitely come back if i needed to :)< /review>

The doctor was amazing and I'm so happy to have come back to Lens Crafters after making the mistake of going somewhere else this summer where my lenses were not done properly. And then, on top of it all, I had met Fadi at the "other" store only to find that he is now with you! Fadi is a wonderful asset to your team. I feel right back at home!<//review>

<review>Great experience, even during Covid times. They clean and pull the glasses anyone touches off the floor to reclean before putting them back out for others! The doctor was super nice and helpful with products I should be using and even have a few back up options in case I have a hard time finding a certain brand. Will definitely return. Finding the LensCrafters store was the hardest part lol.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>It was a relief to go back after two years and see the same doctor and youre exam is thorough with the latest technology to look right into your eye  I think it's far better than any other place just offering eye exams they don't go this deep in your eye.  the staff professional courteous and are following all protocols for covid-19 which was nice to see so I really have no complaints this place rocks in my opinion they don't always have the type of glasses I want but I usually leave with a pair that im happy with. Eye exam is extra  so i would recommend doing it and sitting with the doctor after words and talking about whats going on is so cool . I was going every 2 years but now ill go every year to keep an EYE on things in there. But would  recommend.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

My visit to Mission Valley was exceptional from the moment I came in throughout the entire experience.  I have been having some concerns about my eye health, too, and the doctor and entire staff were calming, supportive, and knowledgeable.  Selection of new frames was a breeze and I felt more comfortable than ever with the assistance and guidance provided.  I will surely recommend to anyone needing optical services this fine facility.<//Review>

My initial experience with the store was that I found everyone to be helpful And efficient and that’s true to a degree. The Dr. was great and extremely personable. On the sales side of things I had a bit of a challenge in that I was given inaccurate information on four separate occasions and that can be quite frustrating. From  whether a sale was still ongoing, to what the sale includes, to whether my exam included glasses or just contacts, to the actual cost of my purchase. It could be that my person was new and was poorly trained or wasn’t trained at all but that doesn’t negate the frustration I felt. I got my prescription but I ended up buying the contacts on-line and I’ll get my glasses from Costco. It’ll just be easier in the end.</review>

Everyone was very sweet! The tech who ran all my test was great, and didn't get annoyed with me for being such a spaz with the tonometry test. I loved the doctor I saw! He was very thorough in explaining what was going on with my eyes, and showed genuine curiosity in my case. He is definitely one of those people who chose the right career, and it shows in how passionate he is about what he does.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>My experience was very pleasant.

The staff treated me with kindness as soon as I walked in the door, each attentive and thorough.

Dr. Cintron had excellent bed side manner and professionalism in spades. He was witty and made me laugh as well; always a plus!

Walking into this visit was very hard for me because I was leaving behind a provider that I had trusted for years. After today’s visit I am confident in my decision to switch over to this office and Dr. Cintron for my eye care needs.

Thank you guys so much.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I really love Dr. Cintron. He's very attentive and answers all my questions.  He has a kind & relaxed demeanor, which makes the eye exam a calm yet informative experience.  I always recommend him when my co-workers or friends are looking for a place to get their eyes examined.< /text>

<review>When I arrived, I was pleasantly greeted at the front desk and assisted thoroughly. I had accidently came in two weeks before my appointed date,but was given the choice to stay or keep my previous appointment. I appreciated that I was not made to feel foolish, but was able to be worked into the day's schedule.
Moments later, the technician aided me with preliminary testing, questions, and explained the process of each station. She helped me pick out glasses and gave sound advice on the one's we both chose for me to try.She answered all of my questions or made sure to find answers for questions she did not know.
The doctor was very consistant and reassuring of any answers she gave to my concerns.</review>< Gmap_id>

They were all so nice!  And an especially massive THANK YOU to Dr Cintron!  So helpful and informative and, thanks to him, I now have an appointment to have Lasik eye surgery when I never thought I could (was told that my eyes were too terrible to have Lasik and that I would need $12000 implants in order to see without contacts/glasses).  I guess you could say that he kind of changed my life!  Mission Valley Family Optometry is so fabulous!  From the start when I called to make an appointment to checking in at the desk to Dr Cintron to the associate who helped me at the end...they were all so friendly and helpful and had great customer service.  Thank you thank you!!</text>

Great food.  Good music.  Taco Tuesday rocks. The outdoor dining area has a couple of warming fire pits to keep your tootsies warm.  Definitely going back. Casual  attire. Fair prices.< /text>

Highway 80 was packed. We got off to get some food and drink. This restaurant had the opportunity to be the savior, the empathetic warm restaurant providing warmth, drinks and food. Instead, the two women obsessed the entire time about who was using the bathroom, where the key to the bathroom was, how long people were in the bathroom, if people using the bathroom had ordered at least $10 of food - we had and I head asked about it 3 times by the same woman. I sat at the bar, trying to enjoy my more than $10 of food and drink and had to listen to 2 dozen grilling and lecturing of customers about the bathroom. Come on guys. Haven’t you ever needed the bathroom before? Is it such a big event? I feel</review>

The old Gold Run. The buildings used to be the old Gold Run Post Office, Cafe and gift shop, but the inner walls are gone and a bar now occupies the space.

I didn't stay long but it looks like a great neighborhood watering hole or a good place to stop for a wet one on the way to Reno. I wish I'd had time to stay longer. I hope to stop by again.</Review>

< Review>
El Buen Cacao served me what was quite possibly the greatest milkshake of my life. The Ghost shake is made with their ghost pepper chocolate and had the perfect amount of spice, for my taste. My husband and I had to order a second one it was such a transcendental experience. I think they really shine in their drink selections here, but their individual chocolates were delicious, pure and beautiful. I tried the pistachio, peanut butter and fig. All supporting roles to the star; that beautiful chocolate. The staff was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. They created a wonderful environment in which to enjoy a wonderful food experience. I cannot wait to go back.</Review>

Hubby in need of coffee and spotted this place after eating pizza across the parking lot. As we got close realized that it is a chocolate place too. Ordered the Mexican Hot Chocolate - wow, was perfect. Finally had a couple chocolates too worth the price.< /Review>

The REAL DEAL for dark chocolate lovers... bean to bar, small batch, family owned and managed- DELICIOUS  chocolates, bars and beverages like agogato & sipacado & Mexican hot chocolate & ghost pepper chocolate milkshakes.
High end chocolates- high end prices- but definitely worth trying at least once.</text>

This homemade dark chocolate place is the best! It's family run and you can see where they make their own chocolate. They have milkshakes, truffles, bars, and more! They get their chocolate from several sources and they each have a distinct flavor difference. So good!! I recommend it for sure!<//Review>

We found the best little shop in town to get some delicious and high quality chocolate! We liked it so much, we came back the next day to try something else. My husband and I ordered a chocolate shake to share (they are small shakes, so it was perfect for us to share before dinner). We also got a piece of caramel and a haystack chocolate for after dinner. Everything was delicious, and more on the rich dark chocolate side. The next day, we shared their peanut butter fudge (we didn’t love it as much as the other items, because it wasn’t a traditional fudge).

If you really like them, they ship all over the country! Very progressive.<//text>

Idyllwild in general does not have the highest level of cuisine, but this place really stands out as outstanding (I also love Ferro, which uses their chocolate in an amazing gluten-free chocolate cake!). I highly recommend the Mexican hot chocolate, and they have non-dairy milk options, including Oat milk! Very progressive of them in this beautiful mountain town! We will go here every day while we are in town! Great for anyone with gluten allergies or milk allergies!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>El Buen Cacao is a must stop Idyllwild destination! They offer fantastic bean to bar chocolate that they manufacture onsite. They make bars, truffles, fudge and drinks, with my favorite being the sipping chocolate. The owners are extremely passionate and friendly. The chocolate is delicious and I highly recommend stopping by!</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhZyN5xX74mY92zHMnC7scdtgpq6qDV1MfmDbY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5S4byQVkDOogQ2hi3oSzYXHfeL0MhkH3zd510=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN04UqGUXZLKYu7OGM7esiKwSeUBo_o_PC9IwXc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGTdihexWX_3a2oPmb5pMicLEzMw4JQe22qCKr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics></record>

<review>Everything about this family owned shop is amazing. Everything is made from scratch. It's off the beaten path a bit, but completely worth the trip. If you are in Idyllwild, California you HAVE to stop in and get some chocolate!</review>< pics>

<username>One More Bite Blog</username><review>Fantastic artisanal chocolate maker, incredible chocolate truffles, chocolate dipped fruit and fig & chocolate milkshakes topped by cacao nibs.  Lovely little nook in Idyllwild village.  And the nicest owners ever, feels like seeing family even though we only unfortunately make it in once a year when we travel in for a summer getaway.  A must stop when in Idyllwild.< /review>< Response>

Wonderful atmosphere with an incredible husband and wife team. They both clearly love what they are doing and that passion is reflected in the items they serve. I tried the Mexican Hot Chocolate for the first time and it was really tasty, not too sweet and not too much heat.

My family and I must have had a 20 minute conversation with both of them about chocolate, it’s origins and a recent trip they took.

It feels good to support local, family run business such as this. Will definitely be back on out next trip to Idyllwild.< /review>

WOW-

First - this little girl, literally knee-high, who looks like she could be a Disney character told me the store was closed and I couldn't go in. I asked her what time they closed and she said "30", being that it was 4:40, I assumed they closed. Then my wife tried to go in and she said "No, you can't go in there" we went in anyway and were met with the smell of chocolate... GOOD chocolate and a smiling, grown up version of the little girl we met outside.

After reviewing the menu - I really wanted to try the Violetta but didn't because I just had espresso - we ordered truffles and sampled some of their bars.  Without exaggeration, this is the best chocolate I've ever tasted. The truffle was perfect. All the big name brands don't hold a candle to these folks.  This place has ruined all other chocolates for me.

We'll be back for sure. Highly recommend.

AS FOR THE POSTS ABOUT THEM BEING RACIST:
The owner is American and his wife is Peruvian - and his precious little daughter is of color.

I don't believe the race card applies to these people.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Edit 2/3/21 - My last review was 5 yrs. ago & since then they have a new bigger location. The place is still good and they have added coffee drinks to their menu & are now selling merchandise with their store logo. They also have some art up for sell, even some from one of the owners.

From 5 yrs. ago: Exquisite! The setting is very inviting and peaceful and the chocolate...mmm...! Their chocolate ranges from sipping chocolate to different kinds of truffles, from Mexican hot chocolate to chocolate bars. The owners are kind and are great in spicing up their chocolate shop with different kinds of chocolate goodies.
My personal favorite is their sipping chocolate, but their truffles are delightful!

By the way, if you're an artist who loves chocolate, it's a great spot to be filled with delicious artisan chocolate and be inspired. Definitely, a great place to go to quench your chocolatey appetite.< /review>< Pictures>

<date>1501888276295</date><text>We visited this place for the first time today. The owners are so friendly and welcoming.  All the chocolate is dark chocolate (which, in my opinion, is the best chocolate!). It is the most delicious creamy chocolate I've ever had. For a drink I tried the Mexican hot chocolate iced (they had 4 non-dairy options which was awesome for me) the owner suggested the oat which was so good. The raspberry truffle was also to die for. We took home two chocolate bars, the raspberry and the ghost which I'm so looking forward to trying tonight. I highly recommend this place!<//text>< resp>

<text>The owner, Erik, was amazingly friendly and easy to talk to.  Their chocolate was superb.  My fiance and I each ordered hot chocolate and we shared a 80% nibs chocolate bar.  It was delicious and filling. El Buen Cacao starts with beans and with a little labor and patience creates chocolate goodies that will make you want to come back.  If you're a lover of chocolate, come here.  We were also happy to support a family-owned, local business that produces real products and has great customer service.< /text><name>Matt Becker<//name><Response>{'time': 1458788487954, 'text': 'Thank you Matt!'}< /Response>< userid>

<Text>I was introduced to sipping chocolate when Starbucks had it for about 3 weeks 7 years ago and have been waiting to find it again. Luckily this is far far better than Starbucks and the owner is an absolute delight. Picked up a bar of dark chocolate with ghost chili that I am very keen to try.

<Text>I was really impressed.
They actually take a raw cacao bean and make dark chocolate.
The owner explained the whole process to me.
Very interesting stuff.
Of course I had to try it.
It was delicious of course.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1553299841575, 'text': 'Thank you, Richard!'}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Hot chocolate is made fresh in house!  Does not come from a big name box or bag of powder.  The hand crafted chocolate is wonderful and delicious< /Review>

Seriously one of my favorite places on the planet. Family run, and they are lovely. Chocolate is amazing and made there on the spot. Love coming here and sitting outside with a hot drinking chocolate. Can't wait to visit again!< /Text>

Get chocolate wasted in the perfection of love for the art of cacao. Homemade, roasted, shucked, ground and perfected into every chocolate dream one could wish for. The atmosphere is amazingly relaxing and positive.< /text>

<text>I found this place last weekend and can't bring myself to leave it behind...best vacation spot for several reasons, good quality, pure, chocolate being the main draw. The owners are awsome and passionate about making the best quality chocolate possible. I'm a huge fan anyway so it was exciting to find a few new ways to enjoy my favorite treat. The chocolate sippers are to die for not to mention the non dairy options they have available. The best part is chocolate in its pure form is actually good for you, so why not have several more cups ;)< /text>< time>

The sipping chocolate is delicious!  We discovered El Buen Cacao the first day of our trip and went back each day until we headed home.  Of course we bought chocolate bars for the road!  Thank goodness we can get our fix online.</Review>

A wonderful, delicious chocolate haven! It's Idyllwild's best kept secret!  We have been two days in a row while on vacation and are still munching on our dark chocolate bar and sipping our Mexican iced chocolate! Organic, rich and worth every penny! We will be back every time we come to Idyllwild!</Review>

Great place to camp and swim. Most camping spots have picnic tables and a BBQ pit. Bring a canopy tent as it can be harder to find a good shaded spot.</review>

<Review>Fun & peaceful INSPITE of how packed it was...

Park fees are reasonable
Park staff was very helpful & friendly...

<text>I usually give 5 star to this place. But due to my visit being on a holiday weekend it made me drop a star, not for the staff or reservoir itself, but for the people that were staying there either camping or day use. How they trash the place is uncalled for. There is literally big garbage bins everywhere for people to dispose their garbage, why leave everything out and let your kids drop garbage everywhere for others to pick up. It's soooo sad.</text>< user_name>

Fun park with lots of amenities. You can camp, or do day use. Beware of idiots with boats. They don't always understand the rules.< /Text>

Yeah sometime it could be loud at night but people are here to party and enjoy the weekend. The best thing your tent is near water and no wild animals to worries about beside a snake I have seen one though.</text></record>

<text>Nice place to camp, if a bit crowded. My son and I did RV camping here for the first time. They also offer tent camping with a few "boat in" campsites.

Most of the activities center around the reservoir. There is boating, swimming, jet skis and fishing. You can walk around the lake, but you're mostly on the side of a road, though there are a few embankments they aren't continuous.

Also, there is frequently a vendor onsite, but they are a temporary vendor (under a pavilion tent) and not necessarily always there so plan accordingly.

One nice touch is that there was an ice cream truck driving around.< /text></record></dataset><record>

One of my favorite places to go to. You can literally spend all day here and on the other side of the park you can you can camp. During the holidays there are fireworks.. There are beach shallows were the little kiddies can play.<//review>

It was very fun but there is a lot of geese poop!
The air is very fresh and it is easy to avoid the poop.
I recommend coming in summer or spring for the water because the water levels decrease in winter but the upside to that is there is less people.<//text>

The scenery is definitely a contrast to the city drab that I'm used to seeing. I didn't come here when the lake was full, but still it was nice to walk around the bottom of the dried lake. The islands were nice to walk around on with a bunch of grass and trees. Has hookups for sewage, electricity, and water if you're camping.</text>

<Text>Beware of spots with lack of shade trees.  Some parts of lake more like pond water then lake water.  Must bring in own firewood but Oakdale isnt far which is nice for ice runs.  Lots of bullfrogs at night and i mean all night making noise.  Showers are available.  Good family fun.  Lifetime memories made.  Been camping there for over 20 years and many memories were made there.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Love taking the grandkids to swim & play. Miss being able to camp overnight... we've had a yearly tradition to camp there. As with millions of others, this year has nixed alot of traditions with the Corona Virus pandemic...including my family's.< /review>

<rating>4< /rating><username>Jenn B</username><text>For the most part my camping experience was good. We were near the water and near the restrooms, there are also free hot showers. My only issues are that they cleaned the restrooms only once a day, so if there's a mess in the restroom it is not taken care of till the next morning, and the garbage bins are not cleaned out regularly.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMye67mXLpvonH6WvKmofRXSjtMc1dwW1DDGZOC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><user>103032718539529872525< /user>< Gmap_id>

I hadn't been there for year's. I was amazed at how much clearer and much prettier than before. I was there with my grandsons ages 4 and 8, we had a blast. I'm handicapped and the swimming area was very easy to park and walk to.< /Review>

Not a bad place to camp. Just make sure you don't bring mord than one car otherwise you get a $30 nightly parking fee.  And hopefully you aren't allergic to cats as apparently it's encouraged to feed thw feral cats. 6 just around our campsite.< /review>

Beautiful boating and picnic facilities, great for birdwatching too. Easily accessible from Highway 120 (about 6 miles). Sole down side: $15 entrance fee, regardless of how much time you spend in the park. Make it a long afternoon!< /Review>

<review>Beautiful place. The only problem was they don't give you a map or show you witch way to go for the right camp sites. It was my first time there. They where rude. I ask for map an they said they didn't have any.
Hire some people who care more about the elderly an give out maps so you can find yourself.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Very nice park and experience today.  Some good memories in this park from when I was little too.  Just wear flip flops in the restrooms.  People seem afraid of putting used toilet paper in the toilet.</Text>

< Review>
Woodward reservoir a great place to go whether boating/tubing, jet sking, picnicking/bbq for the or camping for the weekend or the holiday. A very big day use area which usually get full. From day use areas to camping, Woodward has excellent swim areas for the kids all around the lake. RV full hook-up to camping and for larger camping groups the undeveloped camping area is a excellent place to set up camp. Be aware of the speed limit inside the park as there are Sheriff's patrolling and WILL ticket speeders, their presence is noticeable but they do not bother you at your campsite. Dogs are allowed but must be leashed. Horseback riding is also allowed. A great place for the kids to swim and enjoy themselves< /Review>

Nice place to bring the family for a day at tee lake and a good old bbq. Trash receptacles are usually close and decently maintained which makes clean up a lot easier. Though it's allowed to bring dogs it isn't a great idea as they maintain a "leashed at all times" policy. Areas are usually well maintained and bathrooms or outhouses usually conveniently placed.<//Text>

First timer thinking if we went in early we would beat the crowd. We were wrong. The line was long but it moved fast. After 20 minutes of driving around we finally found a shady spot to hang out and fish. It was secluded and great for the kids to play. The water wasnt to deep for our little ones. Camping in some spots looked super crowded but there are some nice trailer areas. Although there were lots of trash cans there was still alot of trash laying around. My kids picked up 2 bags worth. If the community helped clean it up it would probably be more appealing.</review>

Clean, beautiful camping sites right on the water. Only suggestion would be noon checkout time and 1 pm check in. A small store would be nice during the summer too. Been camping here for years. Love it</review>

<review>My best friend took me for a camping trip...something I hadn't done in years...i was surprised at the amount of people who could camp on the shores. Boat ramps, a general store- a little over priced- showers and indoor outhouses that were cleaned and stocked daily.
Camp fees were reasonable, $15.00 a day for handicapped-must have plaque, letter and ID of course.
All in all was a great place to take the grand Kids for a week outside of boiling Las Vegas!! Had a wonderful time!!<//review>< Pictures>

Great camp grounds. Access to water isn't easy for people with disabilities but with help one can enjoy the water too!< /Review>

Great place to camp, and the lake within feet also plenty of restrooms a shower and store within minutes that's the plus and the negative is a bit dusty from dirt ground but I guess it is camping not glamping right I give this spot a 4 1/2👍< /text>

Peiple should have a time limit coming into the park. We had one family come in at like 1 am and started hammering their tent in right next to ours. Then they spend hours into the night playing loud music and talking so loud you can hear them across the lake. The men who use the restrooms need to learn how to aim because they can't seem to pee in the toilets.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Beautiful quiet. Fair price not to far from most cities.
It's just an all-around nice place to go if you want to get away from it all.
For a day or a couple of days.< /text>

I have always liked Woodward Reservoir.  It is a nice place to go and enjoy the afternoon in the sun and by the water.  You can boat, swim, walk, camp and, much more there and really enjoy your time.< /Text>

Pretty nice place. The roads are a maze though, so Bob help you if you try to find your camp site at night. I drove around for 20 minutes looking for mine. And it's all dirt roads, some deeply rutted or up large hills that you can't see over until you get over the top and start down the other side. A few camp sites are for reservations, the rest are first come, first serve. I had a nice camp site picked out until a group of people took the spot next to mine and proceeded to blast mariachi music at full volume. Luckily the spots aren't reserved so I just moved to the other side of the lake, where there were 2 camps near by blasting mariachi music until 1:30 am. I showed my displeasure by making very loud breakfast the next morning at 5:30. It's $20 a night to camp, so bring cash. Most of the camp sites are right on the water, my tent was about 10 feet from the bank and I woke up to my tent surrounded by geese, which was amazing. Bathrooms are more like outhouses, but almost always have toilet paper... Though I still bring a few rolls just in case. They have little fire pit BBQs which are good for s'mores or meals. Bring a flashlight because it's pitch black at night, except for the amazing stars. No lights in the toilets, so you'll need one for there too.<//Review>

<Review>Time well spent. Reserved area was worth the $pent. Clean, fresh, non smelling T-island. Cul-de-sac has small spaces, perfect for -20ft or smaller. I would NOT recommend trying to fit over 25+ in these areas due to not much space for additional vehicle (for those who like having space between neighbors-like me).< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
I love coming here with friends. It's close to home so provides a short drive but I definitely feel like I'm far away. Weeks days are best in my opinion because it's almost empty and provides quite and privacy. My most recent visit on a small beach though proved unpleasant though because I found broken glass mixed all throughout the sand. It's a miracle I didn't step on any as I didn't notice until 2 hours into my BAREFOOT visit. A more through cleaning crew for the beach areas would be the last star to complete a five star rate :)<//Review>

Woodward employees are great. The park and campsites we're good. Just keep in mind during summer operation, grass is very limited so you have to deal with dirt or hay for ground cover. There are shades spots but you'd have to be on site our have visited to know which ones are choice in summer. Bringing at least 2 canopies will be a must for shade if trees aren't on the site. They have a crew that comes in to clean all the facilities and pick up trash daily. All in all we are looking to our next camp trip at Woodward and hopefully return there every year.</review>

Most overpriced P.O.S. park I have ever seen in the lower 48. $35 for basic camping and $15 just for day use and you can't swim or kayak in the water. What a ripoff. The beautiful view of water and scenery is ruined by signage every 5 feet telling you what you can't do. I'd rather camp in a Wal-Mart parking lot honestly.< /text>

Full RV hookups for a reasonable cost, pets are welcome.  Be aware that September 2018-April 2019 no swimming is allowed due to treatment of the water for drinking (is is a drinking water reservoir).</Review>

<Time>1538849647956<//Time><Rate>2< /Rate><review>Too many mexicans dominate and continually occupy the best camp sites. (They keep using family members names to rent those sites continuously all year round. They put toilet paper beside, instead of in, the toilets. Play music too loud and until late at night. Park rangers seem afraid to stand up to them. They (a lot of, but not all) leave garbage everywhere. Dont leave their campsites clean. Day use people occupy campsites. That means campers can't get a good site until the day users leave around 10pm. I loved the reservoir growing up. But now its like Mexico has moved in and taken over. I don't think its safe for children and teenagers. I'm not prejudiced. But these have been my experiences.< /review>< pics>

This lake is always packed! Since there have been a lot of drownings the sheriffs are on the lookout to make sure every man, woman and child has a life jacket on. If not you can be cited! But its for safety reasons. I did not like that some parts are really dirty with trash in water, the pricing is okay, its $10 for residents of Stanislaus county and $15 for out of county residents. On a hot day its fun!</review>

Bring your own toilet paper, soap, and paper towels.  Its very heavily used and staff are unable to keep up.  A lot of folks who come here should have brought their mommy's to clean up after them.< /Review>

People are always trashing this place. They need to stop being so careless. It's a good place for the family and to chill with friends.</text>

You can no longer swim in the water.. in fact it says "NOT 1 BODILY PART SHOULD TOUCH THIS BODY OF WATER" Absolutely no swimming standing or wadding in the water period. It infested  with mosquitos more then any other year we have been there. No more running water at the camp sites nor in the bathrooms. NO REASON TO CAMP HERE ANY MORE.. they don't have the no swimming even posted on there site and not giving any refunds.<//review>

<text>Beautiful lake

really irking that the park does almost nothing to keep a few wackos from wrecking the fun for everyone else, like playing music until 2am, having 6 tents on each campsite, too many cars, etc

I wasn't able to even park my car in front of my own campsite!< /text></record>

This place is very nice but they need to increase  showers in some areas ,and keep clean the bathrooms, I like camping in this place and is so cool but I don't understand why they have restrictions on the music if nobody is putting complain why the music need stop at 10:00pm like we are in city some times we haven't loud music and we need turn it  off .<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very nice place, you can do everything at once here, fishing, swimming, riding in your boat or jet skis and even camping, it is worth coming the weekend with the family.

(Translated by Google) It is a pleasant family place and has all the services for a better stay, it has a table and seats with its grill next to it, in water it is pleasant and you can take any water vehicle, they accept pets and being removed from the big cities the air is clean, definitely a place to have a good time and cool off in the summer

(Original)
Es un lugar familiar agradable y tiene todos los servicios para una mejor estancia, cuenta con mesa y bancas de butaca con su asador al lado, en agua es agradable y puedes llevar cualquier vehículo acuático, aceptan mascotas y al estar retirado del las grandes ciudades el aire es limpio, sin duda un lugar para pasar un buen tiempo y refrescarse en el verano< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Terrible attitude that this man has as the manager of the park is and is installed there and practically ran from the space that I had reserved for bad luck, we had to win over and as soon as I was going down the things of my car the semester I let go to put his conditions when I know the conditions of the park and he still asks us with an arrogance that from where we were never in my life I go back there

(Original)
Pésimo actitu que tiene este señor según es el mánager del parque y esta instalado ai y prácticamente nos corio del espacio que yo avia reservado por mala suerte nos tocó alado del y en cuanto iba bajando las cosas de mi carro el seme dejo ir aponerme sus condiciones cuando yo se las condiciones del parque y todavia nos pregunta con una arrogancia que de donde eramos jamas en mi vida vuelvo  ai😠<//Review><rate>1<//rate>< date>

<text>(Translated by Google) I think I will not stop for anything since I camped 2 weeks ago and my 2 year old boy and all the children had sandwiches, we commented to the security and said that it is normal which I find horrible because We all know children sometimes drink water by accident. It's so disgusting that the water is very dirty and you can't even look inside.

(Original)
creo no me volveré a parar al por nada ya que acampados hace 2 semanas y ami niño de 2 años y a todos los niños se les pegaron sandijuelas , le comentamos a los de seguridad y dijeron que es normal lo cual se me hace horrible ya que como todos sabemos los niños tomas aveces agua por accidente.😠😠😠😠que asco aparte que el agua es muy sucia y ni siquiera puedes mirar lo que hay dentro.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) Very bad conditions the bathrooms do not have for lakialos, we had to go a piece of rope to saw the door and they do not allow to have a fire in an oyo as well as at 10pm you have to turn off the music 😔

(Original)
