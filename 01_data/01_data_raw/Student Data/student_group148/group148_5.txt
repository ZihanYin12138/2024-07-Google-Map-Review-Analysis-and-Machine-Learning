The staff here is great. They are riders and understand what they are selling and supporting. They are also supported by the D-Store in Costa Mesa, so do ask the manager if you don't see what you are looking for or need.

It is also comforting that they welcome riders who just want to stop in and see what is new.

Stay safe everyone, and enjoy the ride!</text><Name>James Wan< /Name><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>The store was nice and clean.  The staff was great, very helpful and friendly.  The only problem I felt was not having the sizes we were looking for to try on, therefore we couldn't purchase what we traveled 4 hours to go purchase... which was unfortunate if they work on commission. We were set on buying 2 or 3 full leather suits and boots. I love the brand, but we all missed out on a big purchase. 🤷‍♀️🤑🤷‍♀️🤑🤷‍♀️🤑🤷‍♀️<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Normally the store's employee's are helpful, but recently I purchased an item with a 25% off coupon via email since I'm a member. I showed it to the cashier (a young man) He applied the discount. Later, I saw that he only applied a 15% discount. Now I have to go back to the store to get the correct discount.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1609016983542, 'text': 'Sorry for the mistake!

I came here with my husband to get him new hiking boots and somehow we both ended up getting new boots and hats. Levi, an Dainese Store Los Angeles employee, helped us get fitted and was very knowledgeable in hiking footwear. From my experience, employees at Dainese Store Los Angeles are very knowledgeable and helpful. Products at Dainese Store Los Angeles can be pricey, but you are paying for great quality. There is plenty of parking in their lot.< /Text>

Excellent quality gear for protecting yourself while riding your motorcycle. Store is very nice, they offer a large selection of gear and can even custom tailor leather jackets and track suits. If you need protection and cant get the right fit, you need to check them out.</Text>

I come from Bakersfield for their products. I had been to the Costa Mesa store twice. The service here is really fantastic just like the other store. Very down to earth people here. Lee really has a great team here. They talk bikes with you and they clearly have the passion also. I hope they expand this store and make it twice the size. I love buying their cool jackets, gloves, and protective gear. Today I got a d air jacket and a racing 3 jacket in a long size. I’m really happy with the prices and the sales I found here.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

The gear is awesome. The whole Dainese experience, from the first time stopping by and talking to Arash about gear, through meeting J, Lee, Gunner, and all the guys, doing my first legit group ride with them, then purchasing some killer gloves, armored jeans, back protection and assorted swag, has been four stars and two thumbs way up!

After decades working in high end sales, I'm not easily impressed with products or retail operations. But these guys are indeed a class act.< /Review>

I love the Dainese brand, and was genuinely very excited to talk to reps there. When we asked to see suits, your show rep gave us cold stares, was abrasive, and made it clear it was a chore to talk with us. Your booth was a fail because of that girl who made us not want to stick around to see what was on display. Extremely disappointing.<//text><Date>1542592944024</Date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Awesome place for all bike enthusiasts. Gunnar and Arash helped me out with gear suggestions and choices. Got an agv k1 helmet, a dainese jacket and gloves. The guys at the store know their stuff and are avid bikers themselves. A great place to visit for riding  gear. Will definitely recommend this store for motorcyclists.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate><Response>None</Response><user_id>109529555556053035868<//user_id><Time>1546660405417</Time><GmapID>0x80c2a5b68aa9a37d:0x3ff24201892a2591< /GmapID><name>avi mukherjee</name></record>

< Review>
I was in Santa Monica for work the day of the Grand Opening, October 18th, so I decided to stop by and visit the store. I am very familiar with the one in OC that I visit often, Dainese and AGV are my brand of choice when I ride my bikes. Wow the store is amazing, the layout is very modern  and stylish, the guys working there are very qualified and helpful with all the questions I had regarding few new items. I love the jackets that fit me well and protect me as they should and I trust completely.
Thanks Dainese I will go again when I have the chance, even just to say hi and grab a coffee</Review>

<Text>What bad place of business, i had all my window tinted with this place of business and it was a bad experience. Not only do they no go by there 1 year warranty policy the owner or Diego will pretty much call you a lier, i came the day before to make sure they can take care of the issue and get everything resolved. He wanted to blame me because there was factory tint on the glass and I asked him if it's a problem I don't mine going somewhere else before the job start and he reassure me that it would not be a problem. Not only did Diego tell me to come back but that he would do it himself. So today I went in he went back on his word not that I'm surprised most Hispanic business do that not to be offensive, but he didn't even bother to do the work. He thought it would be better that he would go get a haircut and say things under his breath.  Diego you have horrible customers service skills, you should stick to what you say. Customer don't let the short chubby guy work on your car he's more interested in flirting with the chick he was with and texting and worried about his play list. If anyone does want great window tinting go to ultraviolet window tinting they have the best warranty on the work they do. And it's about the same price.

Sure there's not you owner there told me it would be a problem now you get defensive because you were caught lying. Your a joke. You said it having previous tint would no be a problem like I stated the first time. Like I said I waisted time going there and I'm sure every one calling the guy driving the blue Tacoma Diego i must have just his heard everyone i guess. Be a man and admit you were wrong and lied. Any who people go to Ultraviolet Window tinting they guarantee there work for as long as you own your car not this joke. Another learn to count buddy. We'll see each other soon.

Pendejo quieres que suba las fotos que ya todas tienen defectos

Terrible service
The workers scratched my car and did not want to fix it. This place is terrible. And if you are going either way I advise you to take pictures of your car before.< /text>

<text>Points for trees around the gas station. They look to be well cared for and offer much needed shade in the summer. And who doesn't want to look at trees? Soon gas stations will be obsolete. Let's see if we can turn old gas stations into mini parks to provide much needed green space.<//text>< UserId.>

Bad customer service. I bought a lighter paid $10, she gave me back $8 ones. Asked her to give me back a $5 and $3 ones, she said she didnt have it.  Told her to give me back my $10 and I'll give $2 bucks. She said no, money is money. If she believes that she should give me the correct change.  I said give me back a refund i don't want it. The woman said no. The gas pumps ask me to sign up for these programs and takes to long to pump gas. The flow rate is very slow.<//Review>

Old lady was working there. She was yelling at me like she can't hear. Also she come out at the shop and said move your car while I stoped on the shade at the end of the parking lot. She said that she will call the tow  truck if I don't move. I didn't move anyway until I finish eating me and my kids. She was looking for problems of nothing. I will never go there again unless the  change her.<//text>

< Review>
Amazing customer service! I went to Best Buy Auto Sales and was so impressed. They were so kind and professional, they even brought the car to my job for I could view it (wow). When I returned to get my new car they were so courteous and helpful, they assisted me with trading in my car and driving off the lot bin a new one without any hassle. If you are out looking for a new or used card look no further then Best Buy Car Sale.</Review>

<review>Gino is a complete blessing I'm a single mother who is in college and work full time. My old car was consistently breaking down. I called around and I could not find anyone to finance a car, so found Gino and he was patient to answer "ALLL" my questions and he didn't rush through anything even the paperwork. If you need a car I highly recommend him. He is considered a close friend of mine. I'm truly blessed to have found him.<//review></record>

I spent all day at the car lot this was not the first lot i came across but it was the last one i ended at. They were nice and pleasant they were understanding to my needs and was trying to help me it took a long time but they didn't give up until they found someone willing to trust me and i thank them for that. I'm enjoying my 2006 Ford Expedition<//Review>

Yes I know it’s a little read but if you’re considering a car from here it’s so worth it.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE! RUDE OWNER! Thought I would give this place a chance considering the majority of the poor reviews are dated somewhat back. I already researched about the vehicle I was interested in, reading the carfax and learning everything about it. I even called ahead before driving the 200 mi down there and ASKED if I could get the recall on the car inspected, which they had no issue with. Fast forward a few days to where I actually went to the lot looked at the car and asked if there was anything wrong with it if it had any recalls. The salesman told me it runs great and has no recalls. I asked about the tank deformation recall which he suddenly remembered. It was listed for the sale price of $7,595. Asked if I could talk about pricing and that’s when I met the owner. I told him I would be paying all cash upfront but if we could talk about the price because not only did it have the recall but problems with the transmission clutch shuttering. He was VERY SHIFTY (like other reviews mentioned). He pulled up the carfax on the computer, pointed the screen to me somewhat and was saying how good the vehicle is and it’s a great vehicle. I mentioned how I found those issues on the carfax before coming here and know about the reoccurring issues I just wanted to see if we could agree on a price. He said we will play with the numbers and find something out. I mentioned how I would like to take the vehicle into Future Ford there in Sacramento (8 min drive from Gino’s) to get a FREE inspection on the recall. I told him how FORD would only measure the gas tank to see if this specific car had the recall issue because not all vehicles are affected when recall stated. He said that would be ok and he will get the key and pull it out. I told him I would be right back that my mother and I had to go to our vehicle real fast to grab our phone so we could have directions sense we are not from here. WHEN WE GET BACK HE STATES HOW HE NO LONGER WANTS TO SALE US THE VEHICLE! We were nothing but nice the entire time. We were pretty shocked at this considering we just agreed to $8,200 out the door if the recall didn’t effect the car. It seemed more as if he really knew the issues and if we were to go and get it inspected it would of had the issues they first claimed it didn’t have. PLEASE RESERACH YOUR VEHICLE IN EVERYWAY POSSIBLE AND DONT LET THESE PEOPLE FOOL YOU!!!!!< /Text>

We bought a 2002 Ford Expedition with low miles at a great price. Sargon , the finance manager was a total professional , had us out in what I would call record time, car buying has Always been a whole day ordeal.... Not at Best Buy Car Sales, We couldn't be happier. If your in the market for a vehicle, This is the place to go...< /Review>< pics>

Excellent service. Wife and I went in and told them how much we had and they worked with us and drive off a few hours later. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a used car. Not pushing it breast like most used car salesmen. Will definitely go back next time I need a car.</Text>

Gino is everything! He takes care of you and his team he has there is awesome. I bought a BMW 328i with really low miles on it and it runs like a champ. I've had no problems with the car and when I mess it up (like when I hit the curb, lol) Gino took care of me! I swing by just to hang out with him and check on the crew every now and then because their just that cool!< /review>

Came in looking for a vehicle to get my elderly mother and grandmother around. Met Angelina. She not only willing to work with me, she was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  I just bought my 2006 Expedition for well under the bluebook value. It is the best car I have owned. Will never buy another car from anywhere else. Highly recommended.</review>

<Review>It has been 7 years since I bought a new vehicle and I wasn't looking forward to the process due to all the expenses as well as the typical hassle at car dealerships.  Best Buy Car Sale LLC. more than exceeded at making the overall process enjoyable.  I called this place in the morning inquiring about a 2004 black Nissan Pathfinder and they still had it available.  Not sure when I would get down there due to having no transportation other than a bicycle, Luis one of the associates there came all the way to my house to pick me and bring me back to the dealership.  Later he drove me to the bank as needed to help with the whole process.  I have never had better customer service than that.  All the guys here are very honest, friendly, and don't make you feel pressured like you do at so many car lots these days.

Having known my credit was not the greatest, they still worked with me to get approved and drive away in my new vehicle.  The pathfinder has been driving great and I can tell it will be a great reliable vehicle.  Outstanding service and Professional.  Highly recommended!! :)  Plus I got a piece of chicken when I was there which was pretty cool, haha,  They really know how to care of their guests which further acknowledges their award with BBB!<//Review>< Name>

3 month/3000 mile warranty is great if nothing happens by then.
But if it does, hope Sargon pays his end as I did.

i came in and bought a car yesterday i was in and out within 45 minutes which is great because most car lots you will be there all day before you finally get a car. They were very friendly and great service i was playing around in my car trying to learn everything on it and i ended up locking it in 4 wheel drive and it got stuck i took the car back and they helped me unlock it right away i would absolutely go back next time im looking for a car< /Review>

I had been in the market looking for a good used truck. I went to 4 other lots and found a few trucks I liked but way over price. I saw a GMC Sierra on Gino's website. Called him and he stayed open late for me after I got off work. I was nervous to buy a used vehicle...like everybody I'm sure. Soon as I met Gino he was a straight shooter. He told me the truth, never tried to rush me and was completely honest about everything I asked about the truck.I can truly say this is a Man of his Word which is hard to find these days. I had horrible credit, he made sure i got approved and at a payment well below my expectation. A week later i found the fuel gauge was not working correct..sticking...not registering correct. Gino said bring it in and he replaced my fuel pump with no problem. I will refer everybody to Gino. Thank you Gino for taking care of me, Your a good man....see ya next time!!!< /Review>

Needless to say the motor blew up and he robbed me! Never go to Gino's it is by far the worst rip off plus he has the worst employees that almost wrecked me on the car when I took it for a test drive!<//Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Date>

< Review>
first glance this place seems okay so i went to look at the Volkswagen and it was perfect on the outside and we were told it was running well. obviously we asked for a carfax and they only showed it to us on his computer screen when we asked for a print out Gino told us No not unless you buy the car. he seemed very shifty and restless and wouldnt even let us read it he was scrolling for us and he already ran our credit. will never go back and will not be recommending to anyone. i understand Gino has a business to run but ripping people off is not the way to go.the one star is for the co-owner who had a good convo with us but Gino is SHADY. so overall the place is SHADY. DO NOT GO THERE!!< /Review>

Geno motors one of best dealer I have known since I bin driving about 47 years .and believe me I dealt with lots of dealer's in my life time but I never found dealer like geno motors the staff will treat you like a family and with respect like they know you for years.  And there vehicles are so clean and affordable you don't believe as my experience with this dealer made me write this this to share it with you. Go andask for geno he is the owner and he will help you himself and you will see watt I'm saying..Thank you for your time to read this and thanks to geno motors  keep up the good work...< /review>

My parents were in search of a vehicle for my sister and we stopped at Gino motors and decided to go and look at more vehicles but no one was able to beat his price so we came back and purchased a Acura TSX and we just loved the hospitality that we received and the service he made us feel appreciated and highly recommend Gino Motors as your place to shop for your vehicle.</text>

I bought a 2006 audi from this place feb of 2016. Dont get me wrong very nice  people but not as honest as i thought speeding forward to the present i DO NOT have that audi anymore the transmission went completely out from the date i bought the car i had issues i even  gave it back to him to fix he kept it for almost a month and a half saying it was the computer and kept telling him it was  the transmission i got the car back and not even a month later same transmission issues i gave it back to him to fix again hes still  saying its the computer finally got it back again (remind you I'm  paying monthly on this car that  i don't have due to the fact that i kept giving it to him)  few more months go by BOOM transmission goes completely out i gave the car back oct 2016 now im stuck with a bill. Look else where people im furious i have to buy another car now and i had that one all of 4 months in my possession these people aren't honest AT ALL.<//Review>

<text>I tried to buy a car thru craigslist private owner.  What a joke.  I found Gino on craigslist also and thought I would give it a try.  I called from SF because he had a van that looked up my alley.  I was definitely pessamistic after what I had been thru but I decided to drive to Sanramento after talking with Gino over the phone.  I am not sorry that I took the time.  I bought the van and he delivered my car to Daly City.  So far so good....Thanks Gino< /text><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful staff, very helpful and quick with all issues. Very nice gym, wonderful outdoor work out zones as well fitted with astroturf so it's easy on knees and wrists, frequent vendor visitation so watch your emails to know who's coming by for a nice dessert or delicious dinner. Apartments are very clean,  noise hasn't really been an issue. No real complaints, the gym, pool, easy walking distance to stores and dining, friendly neighbors have all been a great benefit.<//review>

Although we wish we could purchase a home, we must continue to rent. But honestly, I can’t picture leaving this place. We love the office staff! Kylee, Ericka, and Taylor are simply amazing. They continue to go above and beyond for us! The service team is so amazing! They always do a great job and are so friendly. Steven, Sam, Daniel, and Pedro are All-Stars! Super knowledgeable and professional. Everything is done right away and with a smile. If I could give a 6 star review I would. Highly recommend living here, you will not be disappointed 🤗< /text>

I have lived here for close to two months now and can say that everything from the leasing process to the promptness of service (a minor AC fix) has been 5 stars. The leasing office (thank you Kylee!) has been superb, the grounds are pristine and quiet and most importantly the apartment has been perfect as advertised! Do not hesitate to consider moving here if you are looking for the same.</Text>

She answered all of my questions and was super thorough! She made the move quick and easy and I’d recommend her to anyone looking into Vintage apartments.

I lived here for a year. It was great. I made an emergency service request one night roughly around 11 pm. Maintenance came out within 20 minutes. It was always quite and peaceful. I strongly recommend this place, it’s a great place to live.<//Text>

Overall 4.5 stars but that's not possible so I rounded up. Upon move in there were a couple things that needed attention from maintenance that should have been taken care of between occupants. In their defense we moved in the week between Christmas and New year's so they had the holidays in there and less time to prepare for us. Maintenance has been very quick to respond (within 24 hours) to any of our needs.  The leasing staff are all really friendly and helpful. They take their job seriously. We love our floorplan and that there is the option to have an attached garage on the ground floor. With our front door heading out to a cute patio with a gate to the street, our apartment feels more like a townhome.
The only complaint I have is that we have a side door that makes our dining room feel smaller and it's frankly awkward because maintenance and guests use both the side door and the patio door interchangeably. We also get A LOT of noise through the side door from people walking by talking on their phones. BUT it does make our apartment wheelchair accessible, so that's good.
Double pan windows are great! The kitchen has a ton of storage. The patios are large. And there is a bunch of extra storage.</Text>

Our experience at Vintage has been amazing. Amber has been such a help since the moment we decided to apply for our apartment. She is so patient and answered all of our questions. We were approved in what felt like minutes. Compared to the other apartments we looked at, Vintage had the best customer service of them all!! I tell all of my friends who are looking for an apartment to apply here!!!!</text>

<Review>When I first move here my air conditioning was not working right it was leaking water on the floor. Also maintenance is horrible they never clean outside leaves everywhere dog poop and they never water plants trees by my room window look so dry
fireplace by pool never works
I also hate the fact that you have to get passes for your visitors car and guess what they control how many visit you may have because you are only allowed to have 3 a week !
Yeah they’ll tell you to park out side and there’s never any parking outside...  oh and staff not so nice after you move in.. that’s my experience here at vintage apartments< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Vintage has been nothing short of outstanding. We originally had papers signed for another apartment and it was the worst experience. I’m so glad we ended up choosing to live at Vintage. Vintage made the move in process so easy and smooth. So far Amber and Taylor have been awesome and Ian and Daniel from maintenance have been quick to respond. Overall the first week has been great!<//review>

Vintage Apartment homes is by far the most excellent place to live in the IE. The staff is beyond exceptional, the property is beautiful and beyond well kept and the entire application process and move in was very easy and pleasant. My leasing consultant Ms. Amber Williams was amazing! She made everything easy from start to finish and always checked on me to ensure that everything was okay. Surprisingly on my final walk through before my move in day, she even set all my clocks and my thermostat for my air conditioner to my likings. Talk about customer service!! If you aren’t living here, you’re missing out!! Thanks Vintage!!< /Text>

<Review>Vintage apartments are the best! All the staff are amazing, always helpful, friendly, professional and were there for all of us during 2020! They helped ensure we all made it through safely, yet comfortable in our apartments.
The complex is a great place to live, great amenities, and always a welcoming environment to return to.
Apartments themselves have everything you need, and the fantastic maintenance staff are always available to ensure everything is kept up and working as it should.
Vintage is simply a great place to call home!!<//Review><Name>David Skott<//Name>< user>

I normally in the middle when it comes to writing about writing about a business. This experience here has been horrid. Before we decided to move here we were told of all types of activities the complex offers tentants. Since I have been here not one, they have cookouts one day of the week but it another way to spend more money at the this overpriced place. Since I have been here I have had problems after problems from maintenance to the coworkers who came to my home when I was gone. I always had someone from the office calling to complain, and not just regular letters threats with legal action. I am not here for months out of the year, if anyone cares about there hard working money do not come here. This place anyone can be qualified to live, and you See cops parked in the complex during the week. This kind of sums up my stay here. I hate writing bad reviews This management team who organizes this area need to improve the stay of the people living in this complex.< /review>

I love this place so much. The move-in experience here was the best I've ever had, from the moment we started looking at the place to how impressed we are even a few weeks later. The whole staff is so helpful and nice and the property is beautiful. We feel like we're living at a resort.

Natasha walked us through the tour and was funny and patient and sweet and gave us all the info we needed without pressuring us at all. She and Vanessa kept us posted throughout the whole process and made everything easy (which was SO nice, as I was going through some challenging personal stuff right as we were about to move in).

Patrick, the manager, is super easy going and friendly and is quick to respond to any concerns or requests (he even gave us plastic forks when we realized we'd picked up food for ourselves and the movers and all our utensils were still in the truck!)

Daniel is the maintenance guy, also very friendly and really seems to take pride in his work (and it shows!) He took the time to walk through the apartment with Natasha and I on move in day to make sure I didn't have any concerns, and when I expressed concerns about a fire alarm testing he'd informed us about (it was going to start before we usually wake up) he made sure our building would be tested last to minimize any inconvenience.

In fact, everyone who works here is just...amazing. They've all gone a little out of their way to make sure we're happy and have everything we need.

Words can't express how great this place is, but I'll give you one last  example: on move-in day there was a booth set up to sell fresh funnel cake and deep-fried oreos -- and we just got an email saying tomorrow morning they'll be giving out free breakfasts on the go, just to show their appreciation for their tenants. WHAT?!

We almost went with another place nearby but are SO glad we ended up here.</text>

< Review>
Been here with my husband and my now 3yr old son for about 8 months now and we don’t have any major complaints besides the tandem garage and lack of gym, but we’ve dealt with it. Also, parking for guests is the worst, hard to host. Other than those, we’ve loved our stay here so far. We would still recommmend this place to others.

The price to us was worth the location and modern interior/exterior of the apartment. Kitchen appliance aren’t the super modern fancy ones but they don’t look that old and are in good working condition. We found a dead cockroach once in the kitchen but not sure how it got there since we live on the third floor.. or assumed it was the hot weather recently.

We haven’t personally been involved with any of the crimes reported in any of the reviews, so maybe we just lucked out? But we haven’t had any issues like break ins or anything stolen; maybe because we also live on the third floor, lol.

Maintenance service team are the absolute best! They respond very quickly and we’ve never had a problem with them them. They recently installed a nest for the AC controlled by our phones, super convenient.</Review>

I wanted to reach out to commend Daniel for a wonderful act of professionalism and kindness.

Today, I had a service request for vertical blind replacement in my unit but I forgot to specify to wear booties.

Daniel is such an amazing person because even though I forgot to place a note on my work order to wear booties in my unit—he remembered! He even left me a note to reassure me that it had been done!!

THANK YOU for employing such a wonderfully professional and capable person.

I don’t know what this note can do for Daniel, but his response to my lapse in memory made my day. Moreover, if this can assist him in any efforts to progress with Equity Residential I am perfectly fine with it being bubbled forward to the appropriate parties.<//Text>

<text>Absolutely cannot wait to move from here. Its been nothing but nonstop issues since we moved in. This place is a complete maintenance disaster. The air conditioner will stop working and you have to mess with the breaker to turn it back on. It took 2 weeks to get my apartment treated for ants, while I have a toddler crawling around. They treat on Wednesdays and I put in an order at 8:45 am on Wednesday. The sink sliced my finger open, so they replaced it and here we are 16 days later and this one cut two of my fingers!!!! The dryers exhaust just goes straight into the apartment. The master bedroom and bathroom doesnt receieve any air from the vents and maintenance's response was "Its just like that. Try closing all the other vents to direct the air this way".....The water pressure is garbage. The pool and jacuzzi are always dirty. The time to leave cannot come fast enough. (Most of the staff is great though)< /text>< pictures>

<Review>I wouldn't day it all bad, there are a lot of great things about the community. It's very well maintained, even though I have seen tenants leave bottles and trash around the grounds its usually gone within a few hours.  The apartments themselves are beautiful.  The staff is great and very helpful.

The negatives, parking is horrible so if you're not a person that expects much company then that should be an issue.  There aren't any parks close by if you have kids nor are there any grassy areas for kids to play.  My biggest issue is the apartment complex across the street, Camden,  there are constantly people playing loud music, loud cars passing by all hours of the night.  Police and fire department there a least 3 times a week.  Luckily the Vintage is very well built so you don't hear any of that if you have your doors and windows closed.

Initially I had planned to stay for a few years until I got ready to purchase but, as I mentioned before it's not a very kid friendly place if you have small children.  Otherwise I would have given it 4 stars.

Hope that helps...I haven't heard of any break in's at the vintage since I moved in.<//Review>< Pics>

Me, My fiance, and our 4 yr old son have been here at Vintage for 2 yrs. We have enjoyed every moment of it. Firstly, the property is always upkept. Every maintenance request we have needed was responded with fast and friendly service in less then 24hrs. I also loved how they always gave me the brake that I needed from cooking by inviting us out near the front office to buy delicious food from different vendors (Go to the taco truck, you wont regret it) it also gave us a chance to mingle with our neighbors. Last but not least, the team of Leasing Consultants have made living here really feel like home, especially working with Amber!!! The team has changed a bit from when we first moved here, but Amber has always given us nothing but great friendly service and the help that we need. We really do wish we could stay longer, but If you are on the search for a great, clean, and welcoming community this is the place for you! Thank you Vintage< /text>

Issues I had are in regards to the everyday battle for parking, and not to mention the ridiculous towing company associated with this apartment complex. Can't do their job right, nor does the staff have any clarity as to their policies.  Plus some residents appear to have transferred straight from the ghetto.   Not all, just some, but always those few impact the whole community.  Besides that, the apartment itself was wonderful with ample room. However, the everyday hurdle made this experience unpleasant.</Text>

Tenant 4/25/13 - Present

I have never really taken the time to write a review before, but I had to because I want others to have a chance to experience what I have. I am a current resident and searched tirelessly for the right apartment. This is the first time I have ever lived in an apartment and I must say it feels like I live at a resort. For starters the staff are all amazing and truly do care about you. Anytime I have put in a service request at the beginning of the day they have always been able to accommodate me within hours. The grounds are kept clean at all times and there is never anyone loitering around the complex. This place is beautiful inside and out and I haven't seen many apartments that match up to Vintage. If your thinking of moving in do it. If i could give this place more stars I would.</review>

Very rude staff in the leasing office. Don't even know how to do their job at all. If there was an option for no stars I wouldn't give one at all.
Can't wait until my lease is over so I can find a place where the staff is polite and willing to do their job.</review>

<Review>The parking is absolutely terrible, dont plan on having guests over because they will not be able to find a parking spot. The management is constantly changing, I never know who is in the office and they are rude.  Within the last year I have had packages stolen from my door step, a homeless woman hanging out on my door step (on the third floor), my car broken into and my car battery stolen with zero assistance from the office except a "we encourage you to make a police report"
My neighbors smoke so much weed inside their apartments that my apartment smells horrible as well as the lack of respect from neighbors blasting music all day, again with the management office doing nothing about it. The only employees that seem to care bout the tenants would be the maintenance staff.<//Review>< Response>

<rate>5</rate><text>So I lived at the Vintage apts for almost 3 years now and my husband i truly enjoy the property and the management. We are leasing the two bedroom and 2 bathrooms with one carport parking. Parking was an issue but management has been working on it. The pool and gym is always clean.The property is kept clean with maintenance people going around cleaning up trash. All around the property is nice and always kepted up. Now for management. I couldn't say more about them. From the day we moved in, the management has been spot on. Amber and Josh are beyond incredible and super friendly. They literally light up my day whenever I go in to pick my packages (which is pretty much everyday) ha.

THIS APT COMPLEX HAS TACO NIGHT EVERY WEEK! PRETTY COOL RIGHTT!!!!???

I would def recommend this property to my friends and family.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>They are just fine for the first year you live there. Reasonably well kept, helpful staff. However, as soon as your lease is up, they gouge your eyes out. They wanted to raise my rent about $100 a month, while leasing out the same type of unit to new renters for less than what I was paying. They sent my renewal offer to "negotiations", whatever that really means, and they offered my a whopping $14 discount off their offer. Not worth it.

Long story short, don't plan on staying there for more than a year, if you like to keep your money in your wallet.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>DO NOT MOVE HERE!!! This is the worst apartment complex I have EVER been at. They have break-in's all the time and they do NOTHING about it. When we toured they told us they had security, now they claim they never said there was security. When the police were taking the report they said there are always a lot of break ins here because the apartment across the street allowed section 8 housing. The officer said they are over here 3 times a day during the summer!! Don't let the nice exterior and nice kitchen fool you, this place is horrible!!

We were told nothing about break-ins when touring but the first day we moved in there was a note on the door saying watch out for break-ins. What perfect timing. They have no cameras, no security...so this place is like a dream come true for criminals. The officer says they also have a gang problem there, cars getting broken into at night etc. Oh and if you try to use a police report to get out of the lease because you don't feel safe and were misled they will ask you for $2500 to break the lease. That's right after you get robbed you must  pay them to leave. Don't stay here, its horrible and you will get stuff stolen, I PROMISE!!!

Windows broken into during the middle of the day and nobody sees anything??? Oh and they REFUSE to hire security,  they basically told us screw you. If you have break ins every week the sensible thing to do would be to hire security, but not these people. Oh but it gets better!! They have a hard time looking out for criminals, but if you have a friend park in YOUR parking spot they will tow them. Why? Because only YOUR car is allowed in your spot, NO ONE else may park there, only the single car that is registered in your name. Smh....save your stuff and your sanity and go somewhere else!<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>I liked the people they're very nice, the apartments are ok. Ive only been here for about 3 months and I'm breaking my lease. It's just too pricey. And one thing are the ants! Ants were everywhere in my apartment! They sprayed but the ants kept coming. That was a huge problem for me and my partner. Not worth the rent if we're going to have ant problems.</review>< Pictures>

<Date>1496615750492< /Date><review>DO NOT LEASE HERE!!! Our family knows of this place as the Tow Away Zone. Last night due to technical issues with my brother's garage door (for a garage which he pays extra for) he was forced to park their vehicle in the open spaces which are not assigned to any tenant in particular. By 12:03 am his car was already towed away. He had even left a letter on the dash explaining the scenario as well as contact information... yet he was towed!!! We've read other complaints here regarding people not receiving their deposits upon exiting their leases so now that's another worry for us since I'm the on who put the deposit up. Too bad because I am the one who originally suggested this place. Now we're going to have to take civil action against Vintage and Equity. The real investigation will be uncovering the partnership between the towing company and whoever's getting the kickbacks for $300 overnight impounds.</review>< Gmap_id>

I have lived in the Inland Empire for 3.5 years now and this is the worst experience I've had renting from an apartment community. I have only lived here for 6 weeks and have had so many issues.

I found out prior to move in day that my assigned carport was not even near my apartment. I was 7 months pregnant at the time and could not fathom carrying my groceries from that far on top of having to climb to the second story. So I expressed my concerns and they required me to get a doctors note! So I got a dr.s note explaining that I was pregnant and that I would need a closer spot until 6 weeks after delivery. Vintage said because it was a temporary accommodation, they couldn't do it! I said fine, we will look for another place since we hadn't moved in yet, and all of a sudden they had a packet of paperwork they wanted me to fill out for accommodations and to have signed by my doctor. So I had to go AGAIN to get this signed even though it essentially was the same information as previously given, but this time they approved it.

So after all that,  parking is still horrendous! We were told we would receive a permit for 1 carport and 1 permit for open parking in any uncovered spot. However, we cannot switch car spaces, meaning if I have the permit (sticker) for the carport, my husband cannot park in OUR ASSIGNED carport. So, there have been times when he comes home at 10pm, and drives around for 25 min waiting for someone to leave their spot so that he can park. This is just for someone who lives here! When you have visitors, good luck. I have had to think of a plan to get people to park somewhere else and carpool to my place because I knew there wasn't going to be anything available.

Now for the leasing office, there's usually only 1 person in the office, so it's very difficult to get help. I have called and had to leave a message and not received any word back for more than 2 days. My husband will attempt to get a package and they will have a sign that says " be back at 1:30" and he goes back and the sign has changed to a later time. He will walk down there 3-4 times before finally seeing someone.

I don't know if it's their sewer system or what, but we have a fountain (something we thought was so cute when we toured) in front of our apartment and it STINKS. This smell has wafted into our apartment at times when the window and screen door were open. The sewer smell also seems to come through our second bathroom. We try to mask it, but it still smells weird.

Within the first week of moving in, I went into my kitchen and my sinks had filled up with opaque white water. I tried to contact maintenance, called the front office, and tried to put in a maintenance request which , at the end, it told me that if it was a plumbing issue, don't fill a report out, but to call. However, I called and left a message and no one got back to me. I had to call later on to report the issue. It just seems the systems they have in place don't work and you have to keep reaching out to them, as if you don't have other things to do. I had to call while I was driving to a dr appt because I figured they would close by the time I got back.

Lastly, phone service sucks. We had to get a box through our cell phone provider to boost a signal. and use wifi calling and we still end up having dropped calls. If you're in the parking lot, forget it.

I am dreading the next 11 months of my lease. I was really hoping this would be our last apartment before we bought a house and that we would potentially stay here one more lease term, but my husband and I hate it so much, we are already discussing what we will do next year. For the price, we should have paid more just to bypass all these issues.

If you can afford to, look elsewhere.</Text>

<Text>DON'T MOVE HERE! Save yourself the headaches and go anywhere else but here. The leasing office will promise you the world just to get you to move in. They do not replace you carpets at move in and then take your deposit at the end. They had to wash the carpets 4 times because the carpets were molded underneath. I took pics when they pulled it up. It was very unsanitary. Bad for adults and especially kids if they live with you.

FORCED ENTRIES- People have been using force entries here, knocking on the door and when you open up they rush in tie you up and steel your things. ITEMS STOLEN FROM BALCONYS. people have been reporting there things being stolen from the balconys.

PARKING- It seams as if the security works for the towing company. They must get a kick back from every car they tow. Instead of patrolling for vandalism they are more worried about the towing. Its stupid why even have a security? For shore you will get towed at least once from here if not you visitors will, costing you over $200 even if you go get it out the same time it gets to the yard. When you have screwed up parking like this friends and family don't want to come and visit. This is not something you want.

Bbq- They only have 1 free bbq area available to the tenants for free use, but there is always someone there hogging it for the whole day.</Text><date>1364831783828<//date>< Rate>

These people are scam artist, incompetent staff, and culturally biased.  I moved and they have attempted to make this process as difficult as possible, withheld mail that had to do with closing on my home and never mentioned they had it although we were in their office almost daily to close out or apartment.  In addition to their many screw ups, I was done when they refused to respond to the carbon monoxide alarms going off and stated it was only the battery so no one would come to test the alarm.  Had to call fire department who found unsafe levels of carbon monoxide coming through the vents from a poor cleaning job they did in the apartment below using unregulated chemicals.  Don't move there!  From issues such as this to fighting with drug dealers to move from in front of my garage, to loud parties going to 4am, and Patrick the property manager saying it's nothing he could do.  The worse.< /review>

Ok apartments but a little pricy...lots of ants in the apartment they come and spray but keep coming back...if you ever try to move out don't expect to get your deposit back because they keep it all as of matter of fact you have to pay extra when they use all of your deposit!!!< /Text>

< Review>
It took two days for me to get my tires. I ordered them from their online store and the girl that handle it didn't tell me that I was supposed to call her back with an appointment she told me they were going to be delivered yesterday. Then I was told they would be delivered at 10 in the morning they didn't show up till about 3 p.m. but as far as the people in the store itself they're professional and they handle it pretty good they also allow me to wait in the parking lot overnight<//Review>

Pleasantly surprised by this local business. Great customer support, willingness to explain all service details, and fast service. We need more local businesses that operate this well. Will happily be a returning customer and highly recommend this shop.<//Text>

<Text>I would not recommend coming here. I brought my car in to see what the problem was, I was told it was a small leak somewhere in my tire and that it was still drivable for now. However when I went to Americas tires they were able to take the time to bring my car in and they showed me a very visable nail stuck in my tire. With discount tire they rushed to get my car out.<//Text>< name>

< Review>
I am active duty military and I showed up to discount tire with my truck that had been in storage for over a year while I was deployed.  Not only did they fix everything I needed but I had to drive the truck to Georgia the next day.  They found all the parts I needed and installed everything by the next day.  I had no problem driving from Cali to Georgia and then to Texas.  They gave me a really good deal on a lot of work that was done.  I will be sure to go back with my other truck I have stored in Cali and I will ensure all my fellow service members go here to get work done on their vehicles.  Thank you.<//Review>

<text>Very satisfied with the level of customer service.  Was treated with respect, was given accurate information regarding the necessary service to my car and time to complete the work.  My car was ready within the promised timeframe.  This location has consistently met my car service/repair needs and is my "go-to" place for my car repair/service needs.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80db1f59eb372a0f:0x7639855b9240d7e2< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Driving home to Arizona from Knott's Berry Farm I stopped for gas in the desert. My dash lights indicated my tire was low. I found Discount Tire in Desert Hot Springs and they had me back on the road in 30 minutes. Found a nail in the tire and repaired it. Didn't even charge me. These guys were awesome!< /Review>< Pics>

< review>
i went here for the first time and got a really good deal on my tires and i got the yearly alignment, which comes in handy (highly recommend). i will say though this last time i was in i had a leak in a hose and they offered to fix it no charge. when they were fixing that hose the man broke a different hose. they did offer to fix that one as well. Even though two things that i didnt go in for were broken they offered to fix it free because of the mistake. i appreciate honesty and they kept it for a little while longer to fix, no biggy. :)< /review>

Outstanding customer service. We are from Florida traveling the SW this spring and our tow vehicle had a slow leak in the right rear tire. They found the problem, patched our tire and sent us on our way. Even checked our spare for air pressure. Will tell our RV friends of the great service at Discount Tire in Desert Hot Springs CA.</Review>

Very nice, but slow, they all walked around doing nothing. Worked on my car for 10 to 15 minutes at a time then walked away to talk to everyone. . Then every single person went to lunch and stop with my car. I only needed lug nuts and the stem inside.  One tire to be fixed . 4 hours and over 30$ more then when he said ." it may be up to 100$ but no more then 100$". He was asked several times and said same thing. . 100$ tops. Well I would not have minded 138$ if they worked on my tire till done and at least one might at least worked while the entire place took lunch.. Keeping in mind.. The tire machine was down . I was the only car..<//text>

Call to have a tire alignment. Was told, "if you can get here in 20 mins, I can take of you within the hour".

I was there 12 mins. It took them 2 1/2 hour to get it done.
I was told partly the delay was because of the local school just letting the kids out. My thought, why not just go the other way?

Otherwise, the work was done well.< /text>

They made a mistake on my alignment and wouldn't take responsibility.  That ruined my tires.  Came back to get new tires and oil change.  Had 2nd vehicle here and only one with an appointment at 8AM and it still wasn't done until almost 12PM.  4 hours?  When I came back, all kinds of other people were serviced and gone...  Garbage policy to let a vehicle sit and give priority to people sitting in lobby.  Terrible... They tried to adjust the alignment again (for free) 3rd time in last 4 months, and asked me to come back in 2 weeks to double check it.  If it actually is fixed, I'll add a couple stars in 2 weeks.

Update.  The fixed it and tires are great.  Perfect to next oil change.  But, they forgot to top off my fluids and didnt even rotate my tires.  They said didnt look like it needs it... even though I asked for the rotation, theu didnt do it.</text>

I'm sorry to say that at the moment this shop can't help you.
They are having to turn away customers everyday  more and more because they can't order any parts or tires.
If you need some tires go see Jeff Lucas at are Yucca valley location.
They have everything you need in stock.<//Review>

Well the service is very slow by the time they charge you all of the extra fees it works out to be the same as going to any other tire shop and buying a tire prices are not any better than anywhere else< /Review>

Paxio is the anti-Comcast and the anti-AT&T!

Their support is local, well trained, and responsive should you need them.

No port blocking.

RELIABLE!

Paxio is a great ISP!

I'm just a happy customer.<//text>

Great ISP, much better than the comcast trash I had before. Using them for over 7 years now. Stable connection, very high speed, responsive and professional support. Only 3 or 4 outages in all this time. Please keep it going</review>

I cannot believe the good fortune I had in finding Paxio and then to have them servicing my home address.
Their installers are top notch, friendly, professional, and thorough.
The service is rock solid with none of the garbage that has come to be normal from monopolistic providers like Comcast and At&t. No caps, no equipment leasing, no required phone or tv service. Just solid symmetric internet through dedicated fiber.

I never want to move to any place that doesn't have this service!<//Text>

< Review>
I'm very happy with Paxio. The service is as advertised or better and a bargain compared to competitors like Comcast and ATT. I have experienced very very limited down time with their service and when it happens, they're pro-active about telling customers and usually resolved in 1 evening at worst. Their customer service response is very fast and knowledgeable as well.< /Review>

So far I have had a great experience. The price point of their services (when available) is great as well. My experience with the service technician in identifying a wiring issue was very positive with a quick response, on time arrival, and efficient and thorough work. Thanks folks!<//text>

Extremely fast and helpful customer service - questions responded to and solved quickly. Turning on the service was as simple as picking a date - no need to wait for someone to show up in a 4 hr window. I'd take PAXIO over Comcast any day!< /text>

After years of being ripped off by Comcast and with AT&T unable to provide sufficient bandwidth I was saved by Paxio and their efficient and friendly service. If you can use Paxio do it and you will be very satisfied.

< review>
After four years of PAXIO's fiber optic service, I couldn't be more pleased with its speed--blindingly fast, as promised--and dependability, with an average of one noticeable but generally brief outage per year.

The real surprise though, has been customer support, tech support, and the installation experience--all of them way above my expectations. They're good listeners and problem solvers, better than any I've had before.

PAXIO is the upbeat sequel to "The Cable Guy." Let's hope they stay this good as they become more established.</review>

Never heard of this provider until I moved to my current place a couple of years ago. The Internet is always super fast and reliable. And it is so much cheaper compare to other providers, my payment has been the same over the years, where as all the other providers I used before always had introductory price for new customers that increased after 6 months or so.< /Review>

<text>This local ISP is what you have always wished every other Internet provider would be.  They offer fast, symmetric fiber connections with low prices, no crazy fees, and plenty of high quality customer service.  They rarely have downtime and when they do, they communicate with you to let you know what happened and how they are working to fix it.  If I hadn't moved away from their service area I would have been a customer for life. Best 9 years of internet service I've ever had.<//text><userid>103167535687363942046</userid></record></dataset><record>

Interacting with the CEO has been nothing short of professional and "as advertised".  The product is unparalleled. I hope Paxio installs fiber all over the Bay Area so many businesses and residences can experience their great service and fairly priced cost sharing program.<//text>

I can highly recommend Paxio's service, and their tiered plans can fit just about anyone's needs. Their folks at the help desk have been very helpful the few times I've called them in the past 11 years, and my service monthly fee hasn't gone up much over that time.</review>

<Review>I’m thankful that my building includes internet service with our apartment rental.  Unfortunately the internet service with Paxio is often down or out. It seems that they provide high-quality speed and service, yet my experience has left both to be desired.  It seems like internet access is a public utility - like water or power - and the customer service I have received when calling to report outages is somewhat unaware or insensitive to that idea.  I would like to see Paxio improve their sensitivity to their customer when dealing with these issues.  You can’t apologize too many times when dealing with these kinds of situations IMO but I often get the impression I am imposing on their otherwise busy day by pressing on the need for reliable internet service.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Excellent service. I'm a return customer and I previously had COMCAST. No need for a cable modem is a big plus for Paxio and the download/upload speed you get for your $s can't be beat!<//Review>

<text>I have been waiting for a while for Paxio to return my interest form. I'd love to see if I can get coverage for my apartment, but they are not responding to my web interest form submission or calls. Paxio seems to get great reviews, so I'm not sure what the problem is- but if customer service is this lacking on the front end, I'm not sure after sales is great either.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808fca3ab2675487:0xa0239ffffc35553b< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Service in our building (Lampwork Lofts, 1614 Campbell) went out more often than I would like, but it wasn't even as close to typucal Comcast outage levels.  Sometimes hard to get folks on the phone, but Chris is a damn miracle worker and sound very medals, bonuses, a monument in his honor, etc.  I would still use them, but they just don't have a big enough footprint.  4 stars for now.  Get a better call center (or offer chat, even better for those of us who hate phones) and cover all of Oakland.  Thanks for the service, guys.</Text>

<review>Absolutely misleading description of servicing areas. I live in Santa Clara and checked at least 3 addresses in different places and all of them aren't in coverage area. That was one year ago and I got the same experience right now so I decided to put a feedback on yelp because they:
1. Not updated website with more details about coverage.
2. Didn't covered areas which they've specified as covered ones.< /review><Resp>None</Resp>< rate>

Have had a great experience with Paxio so far—they worked with me to install and sorted new wiring and splitting at the hub and the installation process was fast, professional and pleasant. As promised we have 250mpbs up and down for $69 a month. We previously had WebPass with speeds of 300-400mpbs up and down but they weren't in our new building. As Paxio was already present from a prior tenant we were happy to try them.<//text>

Since Paxio took over high speed internet in our building in downtown Oakland things have slowed down to dial-up speeds.  We used to zip along - now we wait several minutes for simple pages to load (even submitting this review has been maddening).  The technician who came out a while back acknowledged a problem, and said they would be back to do "diagnostics."  Customer Service hasn't called back after several attempts. Let's hope they read reviews and get better at troubleshooting and customer service.

Update - while I never got a call back, it looks like they do read reviews.  Someone came out, took the internet down, "switched circuits" and brought back the high speed.  Glad that it finally happened, so I'll add a star.  But why didn't that happen weeks ago?  Why don't they return calls?< /text>

<Text>Recently signed up with Paxio through our community. Installation was done within an hour. The tech was knowledgable and kept my existing dsl line intact (my backup line during my trial period with Paxio) as per my specifications.

However my problems began after I'd mistakenly configured my router in access point mode. When I called in for help, customer service rep Eddie not only identified the issue, flushed the server side cache on their end and guided me through the reconfiguration process, he followed up again on the same day to see if the issue was resolved on my end.

In an age where we've all gotten accustomed to the atrocious customer service from other ISPs (no need to name them) asking whether the modem was turned on or power cable plugged in, Paxio does it right.

I will not hesitate to refer these guys to all of my coworkers. This is the kind of internet company that actually makes service quality a priority.

Thanks Paxio. Thanks Eddie!<//Text><UserId.>104759251501073020245</UserId.></record></dataset><record>
<text>By far the best ISP I've used and the focus on service is very apparent. I have rarely had outages, or a need to talk with them, but on the handful of occasions service has gone down (5 years with them) it was back up within hours. They are very transparent in why the service had trouble and emails/calls you to keep updated during troubleshooting process. When you call there is no matrix of recordings to navigate but a ACTUAL person?!?!?! To top it off, a while back they changed pricing and the MB packages became cheaper and they called to let me know I should alter my plan! Went from consistant threatening to leave Comcast to Paxio letting me know how to same money and doing anything they can to provide better service.... This is how all businesses should conduct themselves.</text>< name>

I was able to slash my Internet bill by about 50% by switching to PAXIO. The big cable/internet companies wanted to force me to get a bundle to lower the internet bill, or to pay about $60 just for internet. TX+Internet bundle was about $75. I was skeptic of going with PAXIO at the beginning as I did not heard of them before and was not sure of the quality of service provided. The I realized it was the best decision I could have made. When compared to ATT/Comcast, PAXIO has a much faster internet speeds. In a nutshell, great customer service., fast installation, no hidden fees, and no equipment rental fees (just had to get my own wireless router).< /review>

I bought a condo in downtown Oakland in 2008, and the building was pre-wired for Paxio, among other things. All I wanted was fast, no hassle internet at a decent price, so I gave them a shot in attempt to avoid the big name companies we all know and despise.
Paxio absolutely delivered.
Paxio is extremely responsive to issues, I remember early on the owner calling me to respond to an email I'd just sent Paxio--on a Sunday evening. They've grown and are not quite so personal now, but I have consistently had excellent customer service, and fast internet access, at a shockingly reasonable price.
I highly and unreservedly recommend them.<//Text>

They're the only reasonably priced fiber in the bay area and have very responsive customer service.  When I have a problem I can be relatively confident that a human will address in a reasonable time frame. (Only 1 real problem in ~3 years iirc.)

Installation was also a breeze given our townhouse was pre-wired for it, but they went the extra mile and helped us map the various ports across our house to the ports in the network panel in the garage.

As a last point about how much they care, they even have an alias where you can send speed test reports, which they use to make sure everybody is getting the quality of service they're supposed to.

I really hope they can expand more broadly in the future.  Maybe they should adopt the idea of having people pre-sign up with fiberhoods so they can minimize some of the risk in laying fiber that nobody wants to use.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Paxio service has been great all the four years that we had Paxio service.  They consistently upgrade their equipment, provide faster internet delivery both in upload and download.  The cost can not be beat as compared to Comcast, AT&T, Webpass, and others.  Of the few outages that we had, it was due to system upgrades and we were advise of interruption prior to the upgrade so we can spend our time doing something else.  If you have a choice, I strongly recommend that you give it a try.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Paxio is a younger company trying to get a foothold in an industry strong-armed by companies like Comcast. Twice my Internet has gone out because of issues with the residential building here and across the street, but Paxio's response was pretty good and I received a couple weeks of free gigabit service.  Overall my download and upload speed is much better than Comcast at 1/2 the cost and I feel good about helping add some competition to the marketplace. It's shameful that in silicon valley we aren't taking the lead nationally or globally on residential internet speeds. Supporting Paxio is my way of showing that I love freedom and I want to make the web great again.</Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Loved it.  Had them as a residential ISP for 7 years.  I loved them not only because they were an alternative to AT&T and Comcast's garbage, but they provided wonderful customer service.  I had very few internet outages, and during the only major one that I could remember, the CEO of the company emailed its customers to apologize.  Speeds were great and affordable, and they never called or sent junk mail trying to upsell me on other services.  They even upgraded my speed without charging.

Paxio, please spread your coverage.  There are thousands of customers like myself who do NOT want to give business to Comcast or AT&T and would love to give it to small, local ISPs such as you guys.<//Review><rate>5<//rate><UserId.>110982102767636500461<//UserId.><user_name>Matt Anderson</user_name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Awesome awesome experience. I was looking for a 911 turbo all over the country all the way from NYC and happen to come across one here at Autohaus. I called and Neil and Josh helped me get the car of my dreams like a professional would. Very transparent transaction which was greatly appreciated. Thank you guys for the wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this place.</Review>

<name>andrew frierdich</name><Time>1509163419298</Time><Rating>5</Rating><text>I recently purchased a low mileage 2010 650i Convertible from Platinum Autohaus. It was a great experience from the first email to picking the car up last week.   Andy, Neil and Miguel were all very professional and responsive to our questions and requests.  As I live 2000 miles away in Illinois, I had to rely on the information presented on their web site and Neil's description of the car.  I agreed to purchase the car via email and the wife and I flew out a few days later.  Miguel was waiting curb side at LAX when we landed and we were in the showroom 30 minutes later.   The car was beautiful and the information on the web site was accurate along with Neil's description of the car.  We took a test drive and Neil had all the paperwork ready to go when we returned.  There was never any pressure to purchase the car.  So in summary, we landed in LA at 10:45 am and we were out the door heading west by 1:30 pm.  Yes, it took three days but we drove the car 2000 miles back to Illinois.  Utah and the Rockies were beautiful and a blast to drive, Kansas, not so much!   I would also note the service did not end after leaving the dealership.  I had a few request four days later and Neil was quick to respond.  Thanks for a great experience Platinum Autohaus.

Josh and Neal were great to work with.  No high pressure sales tactics.  Very friendly and attentive.  Small dealership who are honest people.  We need more mom and pop places like this.  Will definitely work with them again if I need a car.<//Review>

After searching for the exact Jeep that I wanted for 6 months, I had my run in with 'super auto dealerships', false advertising, bait and switch, tons of added costs after agreed upon price. Then came Platinum Autohaus. I worked with a classic car dealership for many years and know the business. I walked in thinking I was going to get another runaround, and I couldn't be more mistaken. The place is immaculately clean, all the used cars look brand new, the office space is perfectly tidy and organized. A true boutique shopping experience. I was greeted warmly by Josh who showed me the Jeep. Very personable, no sales pitch, just there to help out.

I came back later to test drive with Neil, easy process and handed me the keys. After a nice drive on my own and a full look over, I couldn't have been more pleased with the non-sales push and more of a, 'whatever you want to do, we are here to help' attitude. We quickly came upon an agreed price and the paperwork was started. During the process I asked if they would take my truck in trade, "Sure. Let's look at it." Alex and his crew quickly looked it over and offered me a trade-in value within minutes. I didn't even question the value. It was more than fair and considering the hassle of an owner sale, I said "Get it done." They even called Toyota and completed the payoff on the spot. And within 45 minutes, I had my dream Jeep and my truck transferred to them, everything paid off and was driving home.

It was a pure joy dealing with Josh, Neil and Alex and the entire crew. I wouldn't even think about going anywhere else at this point. They have my business for life and will recommend family and friends to check with them first. I drove off elated, happy and didn't have one regret the next day.

My experience was nothing less than stellar. Thank you to the entire crew for making a usually 'many hour car buying chore' an absolute pleasure and fun too! Kudos Platinum Autohaus! I am so glad I found you!< /Review>

Neil was professional, courteous, friendly, personable, full of answers and ideas, gracious, on top of his game when it comes to providing a new client with a new vehicle. Best car buying experience that I've ever encountered.
If I needed another vehicle I'd go right back to Neil.</Text>

<gmapID>0x80c2b49e916d1103:0x96dfedc4a892c52< /gmapID><pics>None< /pics><review>I am in Northern California and saw a BMW on Autotrader's website that interested me.  I contacted Neil regarding the car and couldn't have been more pleased with the reception I received.  First, he is all about providing you with all of the information that you want and need.  He knew the tire depths, the brake wear, accessories, etc., and what he didn't know, he and Josh found out.  Second,  zero pressure.  I was amazed how he wanted to make sure that the car was perfect for me, which seemed to be a higher priority than selling the car.  Finally, he encouraged me, since I would not be seeing the car in person before I bought it, to have it checked out by an independent party.  I ended up not buying the car because I decided on a different model BMW, but would work with Platinum again without hesitation.  Best purchasing experience ever (although I didn't purchase!).<//review>< time>

I would highly recommend Platinum Autohaus to anyone! I had a terrific experience with the team, from the beginning to the end. They were very responsive, attentive, and responsible. I moved from another state and thought buying a car in California would be a complicated process, especially since I also wanted to trade in my car. But that was not the case, Neil was very professional and helped me the whole way through the process. I know where to go once I'm ready to buy another car. 5 start service hands down!</text>

Honestly I never thought I would buy a car from a used car dealer, let alone leave a rave review. I wanted a pretty specific vehicle and found it here at a completely fair price. I do a lot of research and in my case couldn’t find a better deal, especially for the upgrades this particular car had. But what was remarkable was how low pressure the whole experience was. We drove by on a Thursday night, took a test drive, and decided by Monday to get the car. Sales paperwork took 30 minutes. And when it turned out that the owner who had traded this car in still had the second key, Neil contacted him and retrieved it for me the next week. If Platinum Autohaus has the vehicle you are looking for, I wouldn’t hesitate to go check it out.< /review>

<text>A lot to say here but I had an amazing buying experience. Salesman Andy really hooked me up with all the little things i needed. He went above and beyond for me. We got a deal done in under a week because i was on a time crunch. I live in a different and had to have the car shipped to me. From monday to sunday we got it done and i had the car to me. The car came perfectly and it was overall smooth, he organized all the paperwork and just made everything super smooth. Will definitely buy here again should the opportunity arise again. Do not fret they will take care of you.<//text>< pics>

This was the first time I ever bought a car from a used car lot that wasn’t at a New Car Dealership and at first I was very sceptical. I have a few friends who have bought cars here and so I thought I would give them a shot. I met Alex and he is a very down to earth, transparent owner and great sales person. I came in to see a 2017 Mercedes S63 and a Bentley. Both cars were in amazing shape and I was pleasantly surprised. I ended up getting the S63.  The Mercedes I bought was cleaner than the Certified Pre-Owned at the Mercedes Dealership. They really take the time to make sure the cars are very clean with no accidents or issues. The day after I bought it I took it to the dealership for a safety check/inspection and there wasn’t one issue with the car. I was really surprised and felt really good about the purchase. They also called me the next day to lower my interest rate which was a plus as well. I would highly recommend this dealership. Don’t let the idea of a “used car lot” steer you away from this place it is a top notch establishment with great people.<//text>

I had been looking for a C63 AMG for a while and I found the perfect one at Platinum Autohaus. At first I didn’t think it would be realistic because I’m all the way in Ohio. I was connected with Neil and right off the bat he was responsive, informative, and had comprehensive knowledge about the car and how to help me all the way across the country. Every annoying question I had was timely answered and every concern addressed. I just took delivery of the car today and I could not be happier. Thank you guys so much for a wonderful experience!!!!< /review>

Neil was very much a gentleman and handling the transaction smoothly, easily, and was very straight forward.  I had absolutely zero problems with buying this car from them whatsoever. It was a pleasant and easy experience.  The car is also in excellent condition with no problems at all.  Thank you Neil for your courteous and honest service.</Review><pics>None</pics><gmap_id>0x80c2b49e916d1103:0x96dfedc4a892c52</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I am giving Platinum  the highest rating of any dealership I have ever dealt with. This company specialize in only high end cars in the very best condition.
A friend of mine asked me to inspect a Rolls Royce he was interested in since he lived 5 hours away from Redondo Beach. The car was in an absolutely perfect condition.
While inspecting the Rolls I also saw a car I would consider my dream car. A 600hp BMW B7 Alpina with the perfect color combination. It was in a stellar condition. Both my friend and I ended up buying the cars we found. Neil has been extraordinary in providing the best service anyone can imagine. From seeing the car the first time until final delivery. He is personal, knowledgeable and very professional and will reply to all inquires very quickly. He makes you feel you are his only customer. I need to add both Kevin and Alex as well for their excellent customer service.
I look forward to my next car purchase at Platinum!< /Text>

Had a great experience working with Neil at Platinum Autohaus. I'm an out of state buyer, he made the entire process easy and efficient. I'm very picky with my cars and requested a PPI and they facilitated easily. The car is clean and exactly what I was looking for. Thanks again to the team and Platinum!< /review>

<text>My fiance has purchased 2 cars from Platinum Autohaus, most recently an Audi S7. Their prices are always competitive and the entire team has always been super helpful and honest with the car buying process making the dreaded hours of buying in the past from other dealers just that... a thing of the past.

This time, it was my turn to buy and I knew specifically what I wanted in a Porsche Macan S and the price I wanted to pay and found exactly what I wanted at Platinum.

We will never go to another dealer, Platinum has our business for life. These guys have it down. Highly recommended. Thank you Alex, Neil, Kevin and Andy for your continued knowledge and providing the best and being the best in the industry.< /text>< Resp>

ok..
so when you buy a very expensive car but not a new one you want to know you in good hands. these guys work so differently from what I was thinking about car dealers until I meet them.
you definitely want to take the car for a mechanic check, don't build on your on inspection only. we found a leak in the car and few more things that required repair - a
don't think that because the car is on the road for a few years only it means that everything is working perfectly - TAKE THE CAR FOR INSPECTION.
Neil the sales guy agreed with me and it took us 2 weeks before I got the car but he took care of everything that was not under the manufacturer warranty.
I feel I can call them with problems if I have some in the future and use this place as a home for questions during my time with this car until the next one, and this is how it needs to be. !
very straightforward people - no games.
love the service, love the honesty.. definitely a pleasure to come back doing business with.
my new G class is big fun and the confidence I have is even more.
thanks to Alex, Neil (and Alex big BROTHER) :)<//Review>

I just purchased a Rolls-Royce Ghost from Alex at Platinum Autohaus. This is my seventh luxury car. It is my Sunday car...my fun car.  I’ve never experienced such an honest and clean transaction In the way that Alex provided.  He delivered the car to me which was about 100 miles away from the dealership.  The car was so pristine,  all the way to the tire pressure.  I couldn’t believe the gasoline tank was full.  This means the driver filled up before he arrived to my home, again, I was 100 miles away.  I’ve never posted anything before, but the experience was so positive I felt I should share it.  I will always go to Platinum Autohaus  for my luxury car purchases.  Alex, what a great company you have.  You should be very proud, what a rare commodity,  old fashion good service.  I wish you well.< /Text>

Yes I know this place well cause I bought my first Bemmer here 745Li from Platinum Autohaus. And I still have it... yes. 10 yrs later I buy another one: Chevy Black Corvette. Sales Tony out but Alex still there + Niel & Manager Andy. The process is easy & painless & they super friendly too.
Thanks Andy, Alex & Niel.
I will let everyone know if people want & need excellent condition car, luxury but affordable: get em at Platinum Autohaus.</text>

<review>We worked with Alex (owner).  He was excellent!  He is honest, runs a great business, cares about his customers and his reputation. The showrooms and offices are new, clean and well taken care of, which is a sign of a well run business. It seems like Alex only deals with quality automobiles that were well taken care of with low mileage. We purchased a 2002 Lexus SC430 with 17,500 original miles.  We never thought we could find one with low miles.  We took it to the Lexus dealer for normal maintenance and they couldn't believe how clean the car was, they said it was like a brand new car.  We had a great experience and will return when we need a new vehicle.</review><UserId.>115228238424011413007<//UserId.><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><rating>5< /rating><user_name>kenneth schoeller< /user_name>< date>

Had a great experience working with both Kevin and Alex. The overall environment at Platinum Autohaus was exceptional. Yes this is sales, and like any business they are selling a product, but they have created an environment that is suited for the potential client to feel comfortable and create a long lasting relationship. Have to give props when props are due!</Review>

I could not have asked for a better experience. I worked with Neil and from the time I first spoke to him to the end of the transaction, he was on time and always ready with the paperwork. I bought this car via the website and had it shipped to Florida. He made sure all documents were correct, FedEx to me and return, and took care of items USAA needed. Started the process on Monday and had the car in my driveway the next Monday. The car was exactly as shown and I am extremely happy with Neil and the dealership.< /Text>

What can I say. These 2 times now have put me and my wife into cars that I would have known we’re way beyond our reach. They get inventory that is of exceptional value. And treat you like they really like you. Never have had to haggle in order to what our feeling as if I made a good decision.  Exceptional folks. I run a business. So value another’s that treat me the way I try to with my customers. Honestly with integrity. And a pleasure to work with. I don’t think anyone would go wrong here.</text>

<Text>Easiest car buying experience ever!  Everyone was super friendly and helpful in the 24 hours that it took from test drive to purchase.  Day 1: I test drove the car for over an hour.  On my own.  They told me to take my time so I did!  I returned to talk to Alex, who was very transparent when we discussed pricing.  He also made himself available to me by cell in case I had more questions. Day 2:  Neil reached out to answer some of my questions.  I told him I was definitely buying and would arrive in under 2 hours to finalize the purchase. He had the car washed & ready for me when I arrived. He was very organized and thorough but quick with the paperwork.  Then, Kevin gave me a "tour" of the interior and some of the functions, before I drove off.  All in all, a very pleasant & smooth experience. Thank you, Alex, Neil & Kevin!  I'm loving my car!<//Text>< UserId.>

I have to say Platinum Autohaus is a great place to buy a new car.  Alex, Andy and Kevin are 100%+++++ good guys and trustworthy.  The experience is top notch an enjoyable.   It’s like buying cars from your family.

I’ve sold and bought several cars and all have been awesome transactions and memorable.

I highly recommend them for your next ride.< /Review>

<text>This is honestly one of the best places to buy a car. It was my first time buying a car. Neil and Alex were extremely helpful in making the buying process so quick, easy, and comfortable. The best customer service ever, they really care about you and what you want. I came in to buy the Alfa Romeo and the whole process didn't take longer than 2 hours. I bought the car late in the day and they let me come back for a free detail. They took care of my car like one of the most expensive cars they have whether it's a Lamborghini or Bentley. I will definitely buy with them again or refer people to them. One of a kind experience. Thank you Neil and Alex.<//text>< username>

I found a used Maserati Ghibli S Q4 on their website last Monday and inquired about the car. I spoke with Andy over the phone and made it known I was an interested buyer that has been looking for the past few months. This would be my first time purchasing a car out of state so I was a little stressed about the situation. Andy assured me everything would work out and he'd help in any way possible. Andy sent me carfax, photos & even offered to change out the ugly aftermarket wheels that were already on there for OEM/stock.

I flew out to California on Saturday morning and was greeted with a warm welcome, the car was in the detail shop and it would be ready in 15 minutes. The environment at this store was 100% stress free, nobody was out there running towards potential new clients, everyone was laid back!

After 15 minutes the car drove to the lot from the detailing section and it was like laying eyes on your first love all over again... I finally got the keys to the car to test drive; went for a short drive and everything was how it was described... perfect...elegant...

The whole process of signing papers was stress free, they didn't try scamming you with their service plans or any of that garbage... I still had a few more hours until my flight so they handed me the keys and said to go explore LA a bit in my new-to-me Maserati... Don't mind if I do!

The car will be transported to my home tomorrow and I am beyond excited!

Thank you to Neil & Andy for making this the most relaxed, stress-free, fun buying experience a customer could ask for. I will most definitely be back for my next purchase!<//Review>

The gentlemen at Platinum Autohaus were fantastic. They gave me a fair offer for my 2011 Jeep. The 2014 Range Rover Sport that I purchased, they knocked some money off the price and they even had the car's interior re-detailed, when we noticed some scuff marks. The car was delivered to me same-day and it looked like a brand new 2019 (bought the car in August 2019). I would purchase another car from them.</text>

Great experience buying my dream BMW M2 at Platinum Autohaus! I was impressed with their inventory, every car was super clean and had been very well maintained. My salesman Neil and everyone else I encountered was very nice and polite, they made the process easy and stress free. Felt like I was buying from firends.
I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a high end super clean car.< /review>

These guys are the real deal!
I've been in the automotive industry my entire professional career and I usually hate the final step when it comes to car shopping.  These guys will treat you like family and who can't appreciate that?...
They offer a wide range of vehicles, Mostly high-end stuff and even a few collectables/exotics.
If you you're shopping around, make these guys your last stop!

I've never had a better car buying experience!
Thanks!  JDS</review>

I RARELY write reviews as there aren't enough hours in the day for me as it is...but Platinum Autohaus deserves my accolades as they have surpassed ANY of my expectations!

I go through cars every 2+ years.  I currently have 2 vehicles: a BMW 6 series convertible and Range Rover Sport.  I was in the market to upgrade my Rover and had seen an ad for a Range Rover Sport at Platinum Autohaus.  I have NEVER purchased a car from a “used car” lot as I’ve only heard horror stories, but Platinum Autohaus IS NOT just another “used car lot.” I’ve been referring them to friends as a “boutique” car lot as you feel appreciated and respected as you do in a “boutique” hotel environment.

I submitted my inquiry online, and Neil (the salesmen) immediately returned my call.  He was super polite and informed me that the Rover I was interested in was currently being serviced and that he would touch base with me when the car would become available.  That weekend I test drove over 10 Rovers at other dealerships and finally chose one that I had placed on hold at a major dealership.  I was on my way to purchase that vehicle but decided to call Platinum Autohaus one last time informing them that I had one Rover on hold but wanted to see their particular Rover before I made a final decision.  Neil was great and offered to bring their Rover back from service for me to see and test drive.

I arrived at the dealership, Neil was GREAT! We test drove the Range Rover Sport, and then one more full-size Range Rover that I had seen on the Platinum Autohaus website.  Finally, I decided on the full-size.  Alex, the owner WAS AWESOME! He appraised my trade in, gave me a great trade-in quote, and then worked on getting my financing EXACTLY where I was comfortable with.  He then proceeded on giving me a killer deal on a blackout trim and wheel package which he has delivered on as well.

All in all, I am a former Galpin Jaguar (5 Jags in 10 years) and Land Rover customer who NEVER thought of buying from a “boutique” dealer like Platinum Autohaus.  I will not only get my next vehicles with Alex and Neil, but I have already suggested them to numerous friends and colleagues.  It’s great to do business with an auto dealer that approaches you with respect and customer service and doesn’t speak to you like you are an uneducated neanderthal who is purchasing his/her first vehicle.  Thank you again Platinum Autohaus for an absolutely awesome experience overall!<//text>

Very pleasant car buying experience i have ever had buying a vehicle. I arranged a test drive with Neil I on a 2013 MBZ S550 and  told him i lived about 100 miles from the dealership and wanted to know the condition of paint dents and scratches etc and i was told it was a real beauty. I mentioned i had been to others and was told the same and left disappointed. I arrived at the dealer ship and was greeted by Neil and he took us to were the Mercedes was located and we looked it over wife and myself and fell in love with it. Jim moved it to the street and said take it for a ride I asked by our self's and he said yes i told him i did not know the area so he came with us and he said drive it as long as i wanted and we did.
I must add that the dealership was very clean and neat and very modern looking  first class.
I was a little apprehensive buying from a small independent dealer do to past experiences but after seeing the inventory and talking with Neil and Jim i realized this was a first class place and they had ultra clean and excellent vehicles.
I made the deal with Neil and the had it delivered to my home next day it was trucked in a closed transport and arrived in perfect condition and drive just as good as it looks.
I would highly recommend  Platinum Autohaus and in the future i will purchase another vehicle thru them. The team went so far beyond my expectations and great customer service.</text>

This was my first time purchasing a vehicle from Platinum and it will not be the last!!!! We had an exceptional experience from the first moment we were greeted by Andy. The entire team at Platinum  Alex, Andy, Neil, Kevin and Miguel were all hands down 5 stars across the board professional, kind, and listened to our needs. I just can’t say enough great things about the team here. I was so impressed. They all contributed to our transaction and made it the most pleasant experience for us. Buying a vehicle can be stressful and exhausting. Not from here. They made the whole transaction easy, quick and detailed our car before we picked it up. They really went above and beyond in every single way! I am so happy and so grateful to have the story I do to tell about our very painless and happy experience! I plan to share my experience as I have been already with everyone and to send more business to my new friends at Platinum! Thank you guys so so much for all you did to take good care of us!!! We appreciate you all!!!!<//Review>

<review>They made it easier then Toyota. I made an offer and they accepted it. I was out the door with a used BMW. I was very happy. They treated me with respect and dignity. No haggling; no tricks, no shady stuff.

Was interested in a 2016 S7 they had. Enquired via cargurus and got a call back from Andy. Seemed like a nice guy and we discussed about the overall car condition, warranty, delivery out of state etc since I live in Detroit.
Andy promised he was going to send me a detailed video of the car's interior/exterior within 30 mins of putting down the phone. Its been more than a week with no message and I just saw the car is sold.
Nothing against the dealership but their prompt response eitherways would have earned them my business and got me the car I really wanted.<//review>

<Review>Everyone that works here is amazing. They were all very attentive and provided great customer service. From the moment we walked into the dealership, my wife and I felt absolutely no pressure to buy. They answered all if our questions and took the time to hear our requests as well.
The car that we purchased was super clean and we love it.
We highly recommend this dealership to all of our friends and loved ones.

I recently had the pleasure of working with two people at Platinum Auto House in LA: the owner, Alex and his partner Andy.
I called them multiple times a day to ask them numerous questions about a car I was interested in and had them send me quite a few extra pictures.
They never seemed to get frustrated in dealing with me and were always honest in revealing the condition of car.
After Purchasing my beautiful McLaren I still needed to ask questions; they were always very efficient, easy to deal with and concerned that I was happy with car.
What a great experience they made this for me !!<//Review>

<text>I am completely thrilled by my experience at Platinum Autohaus! Neil, Alex, Kevin and Miguel are true gentlemen and provided the best experience I’ve ever had in a lifetime of buying cars. They know their cars and they understand their clients as well. I bought a beautiful Porsche 911 that was immaculate and they made the experience pleasant and easy. These guys will be my go-to guys for all future cars! I can hardly recommend them highly enough. Buy with total confidence and know you’re getting a car that is top-notch, otherwise it wouldn’t be on their lot. When I took my car to my specialist mechanic he was blown away by how good the car was. Their prices are super competitive; they are looking to make a customer for life and they’ve certainly succeeded with me!< /text>< Time>

Thank you Platinum Autohaus.  Most of our conversation was done over the phone and all we did was go in and sign the paperwork and walk out within an hour with our new car.  It was an fast and easy experience.  Everyone there is very nice and friendly and will help you the best way possible.  And they have a great selection of cars lined up.  Check them out.< /Text>

<text>Very skilled and knowledgeable. Their team also gave me a very fair price for my trade-in. The nearly new car I bought had low mileage, and was priced below market. I drove from Sherman Oaks for the great deal, and am very glad that I did!
I've purchased quite a few cars in my life before, and I can honestly say that this was the best experience I've had. I love the no hassle, relaxed environment of Auto Wholesale, and Platinum Autohaus car dealer is great to work with. Efficient, knowledgeable and friendly. Paperwork only took about 30 minutes which is astounding! Highly recommended if you in the market to buy pre owned luxury vehicles look no further they got everything you want for great prices.

Amazing, best ever car buying experience! I received the most outstanding customer service at Platinum Autohaus! Neil made the whole buying process so easy and stress free from start to end. With impressive professional manners, he is very knowledgeable, friendly, kind, patient and responsive. Thank you as well to Alex, Kevin, Miguel and the team for their help. I greatly recommend that you stop by Platinum Autohaus if you are looking for top-notch pre-owned vehicles at good pricing and amazing customer service. I'm so happy with my new car! I will definitely buy again from this dealership.</Text>

Andy took my call about a car they had posted on the Platinum website.  He described the car (as it turns out, accurately). I told him I wanted it subject to a pre-purchase inspection, and we agreed on a fair price promptly with no haggling.  He recommended an excellent Porsche shop to inspect it, and held the car for me until the results came back.  We addressed the minor issues from the inspection, Andy arranged financing and delivery, and the car was mine a few days later.  The car was absolutely as represented, no surprises.  Buying cars for me has previously been a very unpleasant experience, with me feeling like the dealer is trying to cheat me any way possible.  Platinum was honest and straightforward.  There was no hassle and no shenanigans.  I would not hesitate to send my daughter or son there alone to buy a car.<//Text>< name>

This has to be THE best car buying experience I've had to date. Alex and his team at PA (Andy, Neil and Miguel) are quite the staff. Very professional and accommodating to myself and my particular wants for my vehicle. I purchased a new Range Rover with all of my expectations exceeded. Below book pricing not to mention extensive modifications to match my unique style, all provided by these guys. Alex, Andy, Neil and Miguel are very personable so you make friends with them quickly. I loved the experience so much, it made me even think about investing in their company.

Very clean and top tier high end auto boutique.
You will NOT be disappointed. I definitely will be back.
Thanks team PA!<//Text>

We found Platinum online and they had the car we were looking for with mileage and condition that seemed too good to be true so we drove the 80 miles to get there.  The car was even better in person and they had a great selection of other luxury/sports vehicles as well.  Kevin and Neil were very attentive answering all our questions and letting us take the car out for a drive.  Neil made sure we were good with the car and the deal both before and after the transaction.  Very satisfied overall and would work with them again in the future.< /Review>

<time>1575807888358< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Alex and his staff were amazing! I’m forever grateful . This is the second car we bought from them. The first was for my husband years ago. I thought I wanted a Jaguar, this is after I paid off a car I didn’t ever really care for. I had gone to the jaguar dealer and was extremely disappointed in the staff, the cost and the care I received from the staff. My husband then took me tonPlatinum autohous. I met Alex and his staff. We were introduced to a car that was beautiful ( not a jag) and I was given a price that I could afford. I’m amazed , I would have never been able to drive this degree of luxury if it wasn’t for platinum autohaus! This is a car of my dreams at a cost I can afford! You won’t be disappointed!! They are very straight forward, no tricks, no haggling. When I came back with a couple of concerns they took care of them and gave me a rental for the day. I recieved a fair price on my trade. I promise you won’t walk away disappointed!!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>Alex and his team. Made our car buying the BEST ever. We drove 3 hours to go to his dealership and it was worth the trip. From the time we got there,  to the time we left with our new Z06 Corvette, the translation was flawless. His team was helpful and very knowledgeable. If you are looking for a higher end vehicle- your search is over. This is definitely the place to be.  Hands down.
Once again Thank you Alex and your team of experts. We love our car.<//Text>< pics>

Fiel’s and Kevin’s customer service was excellent. I discovered this private car dealer via website and I was overly amazed with the beautiful high end cars for a reasonable cost. I drove off with my new 2018 X6 with less than 4,000 miles. I’m very happy and satisfied with my purchase. I highly recommend this dealer to others.<//Review>

My experience with Platinum Auto Haus was nothing shy of phenomenal.  To date, I have purchased two cars from Platinum.  Each time, my experience has been outstanding.  Specifically, Alex, my salesman, is the consummate professional.  During the purchase of each car, Alex has demonstrated he is extremely professional, ethical and an absolute pleasure to deal with.  I highly recommend Platinum Auto Haus for the purchase of your car.  You will not be disappointed.  I promise you experience will be like mine; outstanding.< /review>

Again, I purchased a Range Rover Sport from Neil [Sales] and he was very knowledgeable on the make/model, updated me routinely during the sales cycle, and never once made me uncomfortable during the entire sales process. Moreover, the prices are very competitive, sales team is very professional & thorough on their fleet, and they truly care about a win/win or no deal atmosphere for the customer. I will highly recommend Platinum Autohaus to anyone in the market seeking to purchase a high-end luxury automobile.

<Review>Alex, Andy and Kevin provided an unbelievable car buying experience! I was looking to purchase a Mercedes G63AMG, and searched the internet only to find the best value in my own backyard in Redondo Beach. They literally gave me the keys and let me test drive the car for a full afternoon and put ZERO pressure on me to buy it, which is night and day difference to every other car buying experience I've ever had.

I wanted several modifications (blacking out wheels, grill, spare tire, front grill guard bull bar, etc) and they did everything for me at cost (I basically got about $6k in mods for under $2k!) They also gave me a great price on an extended warranty which I purchased directly through them.

After finally getting my totally tricked out to perfection ride, I noticed that there was a slight (barely noticeable) rattling noise that turned out to be a loose hood component. They took care of it at no cost to me, and while they did it they changed out the wiper blades because they weren't happy with them (I didn't really notice an issue); all the while they gave me a Porsche Cayenne Turbo to drive around in. Nobody provides a level of service like this, I was absolutely floored with my experience with them!!

This team went so far beyond my expectations that I had to give them a stellar review. It is no surprise that they have 100+ five star reviews, this is an extremely well run company that earns the business and love of their customers. If you are looking to purchase a car any time soon, I highly recommend you check them out- they have an insanely great inventory of cars, their prices are better than everyone else around, and they treat their customers like gold.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Neil and Kevin are down to earth guys. Fantastic customer service and one of the most relaxing experiences when purchasing a car. Took half the time at other dealerships to be in and out. Got a great deal on my BMW and will definitely do business with them again in the future.< /text>

My experience purchasing a vehicle from Platinum Autohaus was very easy and enjoyable. The vehicle that I was interested in was ready for me to view when I arrived and Neil was very accommodating, allowing me to take my time to look over the vehicle. The selection of vehicles was quite extensive and all the vehicles seemed to be high quality examples.<//review>

<review>If you're looking for a car, Platimun Autohaus is the place to go. Last month I bought a car while vacationing in California. Best car purchasing experience we've ever had. Not only did Neil make the purchase of my Range Rover insanely smooth, he also arranged for my other car to be shipped back to Colorado. Everyone at the dealership went above and beyond to get my new SUV ready for me.
Thanks!

My experience was absolutely terrible.  Find another dealership that respects their customers.

I bought a Mercedes SL500 convertible (paid cash) from here and they registered my car incorrectly, the mistake was never corrected.  Once they had my money they were useless.  For over 8 years, I went back and forth with DMV  and these  losers.  The owner did nothing to help my problem, he either wouldn't take my call or would say he was fixing the registration and never did...it actually never got registered.  I eventually moved out of state and sold the car at a huge loss.  $50,000 and hundreds of hours of wasted time down the drain.

My opinion is that they are a shady dealership that sells nicer cars.  I would not trust them, their word means nothing.

Worst car experience ever.<//Review>

<review>I came across a Matte Black G63 AMG they had online so I went to look at it. Neil-- the sales guy there-- showed me the car; Immediately I fell in love with it. I had a price in mind that i wanted for my trade in (14 Range Rover) and I went in there telling myself I would not go over the specific monthly payment that I had already come up with. Alex, who I think is the owner, showed up while we were discussing prices and got involved. We spent a few hours there and it didn’t seem to be working out (I didn’t want to go with the high payments that the bank was offering). I left and told them I would think about it over lunch. I didn’t have time to finish before they called to tell me they were able to work something out… the bank will finance it for the payments I wanted. Drove back and within 20 minutes the deal was done.

My point is that these people here are genuine. I told them what I had in mind in terms of price and they respected it. No arguing and none of that pushy car sales man stuff. The professionalism here is amazing and for that reason I will recommend these guys to all of my buddies. I will 100% be back for another toy…Gotta save up some money first. Cheers my friends.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Platinum Autohaus team was great!
I’m currently located in Las Vegas, and I was looking for a  BMW 4 series in 4 states. I found Platinum Autohaus online on a Wednesday afternoon. When I called I spoke to Neil and Alex ( the owner) over a course of 3 days. They were very helpful and informative.  I felt relieved when we reached an agreement on a fair price. I flew all the way out from LV to LA for this car on a Sunday  morning. Their experience was A1 service. I even want to thank their Financial Team for being open on Sunday to get my paperwork in. I would recommend my family and friends to them if they’re looking for a great pre-owned luxury car.
From start to finish 5 stars<//Review>

<text>I've never experienced service like this from a car dealership. I'm still in shock and I bought the car 3 days ago!  Alex, was truly committed to making sure I walked out with a great car that wouldn't break the bank. I never financed a car before in my life, so I didn't have good credit to finance. Alex, called around and worked out a deal, 4 hours later I financed my first car and drove home a fully loaded 2016 Ford Explorer. Walking into a dealership being a female is very intimidating, but I didn't feel that way at Platinum Autohaus. I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone and everyone. Thank you Alex!!</text>< Date>

You will get a great car at the best prices possible. But what sets them apart is their service. Trust me you will (eventually) buy multiple cars from them. I did. Three so far! Thanks Alex...

5 Plus stars always for the service I receive over at Platinum. Alex is a transparent guy who is honest and always willing to go the extra mile for all his customers.
If you haven’t bought a pre owed luxury car from Platinum Autohaus don’t ghesitate. You will never go anywhere else. A majority of the cars on their lot are certified pre owed lease returns unmolested with low miles. So if you are looking for a Acura a Rolls Royce or anything in between. Save yourself the trouble of any of these local sludge lots. Go see Alex and Andy at Platinum. They will treat you like family.<//Review>

<text>Alex the owner was absolutely wonderful to deal with. He let the deal flow smoothly with us both emerging very happy. I came down from out of town to pick up the car and it was mint condition. A very clean car. No issues or surprises. He took care of all details. Would definitely buy from Platinum Auto Haus again in a heartbeat. Even sight unseen from out of town. Full trust. A real gentleman. Thank you again Alex.<//text>< Rate>

< review>
I purchased a Maserati MC Stradale from Platinum Autohause and Neil and shipped it up to Toronto Canada. Buying a Maserati without driving or even seeing it was nerving but Neil's service is A+++. I am not an easy customer and even requested very specific pictures taken. Neil sent them all  immediately. The car arrived MINT. I took it immediately to the dealer to get checked over and they were surprised.
I would DEFINITELY buy from them again, and even ship another car up here from them.
Thanks!<//review>

< Review>
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE

I purchased a 2013 Porsche 911 from these people online.  I never received a copy of the title so i am unable to register the car over a month after purchase.

More importantly however, they are EXTREMELY dishonest.  They delivered my car damaged - two rims were bent so badly they could not be repaired and had to be replaced.   Platinum Auto Haus assured me that the car was in 100% perfect condition prior to my purchase.  They then refused to cover the cost of the replacement rims.  I am now forced to go through a lawyer.    DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.< /Review>

I purchased a Range Rover a while back and although I didn't have any problems with it mechanically, they charged me $4000 extra for the rims because they had promised another customer the ones that were already on there.

This is not a hotel any longer! If you work for Google please help in removing this listing including the "call for reservations" link. The phone line is for a private facility and staff will not be able to book you a room.<//Text>

Lovely except "disabled" rooms are not disabled except for wheelchair access to the bathroom and shower. The bed is 4 feet high and the toilet is very low. My elderly grandmother couldn't stay there long.<//Review>

This is the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. Where to start?

Incompetent and dishonest staff
Room not cleaned for second day
Forced to return to hotel, as the second night stay we were doing was not conveyed to another staff, requiring us to return to the hotel, as it “was easier to rebook the room,” rather than taking the information over the phone
To the haggard and meth addicted woman sitting on the edge of the parking lot smoking dope
To no clean towels
To COVID 19 bring blamed for the room NOT being cleaned
To having to get the room keys redone FOUR times to get into the room
To having to service our own towels, emptying our own garbage
To no lights in the hallways or ice maker room
To television not working
To coffee maker not working
To room windows in the back left open, causing the room temperature to be FREEZING
To the noisiest room heaters EVER

I want my money back. What a terrible hotel.....

Worst hotel ever, ever, ever. DO NOT STAY HERE.</Text>

<Review>This is the only hotel in this adorable small town, and it is just as adorable! Very clean, surprisingly modern rooms. Porch swings outside in the courtyard, and easily walkable to anything in town. There is a great coffee shop next door too. Highly recommend!<//Review>< GmapID>

<text>Won't be going back! The rooms are not as advertised! They are dismal and bare! The coffee maker didn't work so I asked for a new one but also told her that I had an appt in 30 mins..didn't bring it back. Came back from appointment to the lady in the office just passing by. Asked her about it and she made a point to tell me that she had to come back TWICE! Look I shouldn't even have to ask in the first place! Finally got one and the coffee was terrible! Frustrating! The pictures of the rooms online are not what you get at all! I was wanting bright and cheery like the pics and got dreary and dreadful! The ice machine was disgusting and not usable! No snack machine like the signs say! 2 stars ONLY because the bed was good. They advertise this huge bathtub and it does not have a bath tub like that..it is a bath shower combo with the commode in the room with a door. False advertisement!< /text><user_id>104254331337568248204</user_id>< Response>

Re- opened just two weeks ago. So ignore all the pictures and bad reviews. This is an old train dept redone. And the train rails have been redone to a biking/ walking trail that goes all the way to Santa Rosa. Beds are very comfortable and towels we're nice and fluffy. I highly recommend this place. The town is very walkable with bars and shops throughout. Don't miss cafe croissant ( a little out of town) delicious breakfast sandwiches and wonderful croissants.</review>

<Review>STAY AWAY!  this hotel is beginning to take in the homeless.  I was there with my family and my husband's family in September 2020 and was appalled by the dirty rooms, no towels, appliances missing nut advertised, smokers and shady looking people hanging around (residents) the Pool and jacuzzi were dirty and not functioning .  We heard two guys arguing about a 'gun' in the parking lot late one night...and we have children on this trip!  Top it off with a rude incompetent office and you've got good times!<//Review>< Resp>

My stay was extremely pleasant. I was only suppose to stay for 4 days however, my stay turned into two weeks.
Being that my reservations were for only 4 days they were able to find me a room for the remaining of my stay. The first room was big and roomy. Room 205. The second room had a balcony which the view was beautiful. Lush green trees, peaceful, Room 209.  What I really appreciated so much is that they allowed me to take care of my mom's service dog. My mom fractured her hip and could not take care of her pooch. I explained the situation and they allowed me to bring my mom's pooch to stay with me. They were so understanding, it was incredible, and meant so much to both my mom and myself. This really goes above and beyond. All of the staff are so nice. I would highly  recommend this hotel. This is the only hotel I will ever stay in when I am in Sebastopol.< /Text>

The phone wasn't plugged in and didn't work when plugged in. Coffee cup was dirty. No snack machine even though there is a sign for one. The price of 368.00 is definitely not worth it. Towels were kind of sparce. No do not disturb sign. It may be a cozy atmosphere but definitely not worth the price.</Text>

<Text>My wife and I got married this past June and had our families from out of town (and country) stay here for about 4-7 days. From start to finish, it was a very pleasant experience. What a relief to have a wedding where all of your family members are happy about their lodging. Thank you for being a positive part of our wedding experience!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< gmap_id>

They are in the process of fixing up the place - it should be nice in a few more months from July 2019. But no matter how much they fix it up - they need to work on customer service. Check In time is 3PM - room was not ready until 4:30. The deck off the room was never cleaned, the maid ( robes  in the rooms are nice) took the robes and towels and never put any back. The pool and hot tub are old.< /review>

Always love this little hotel when we are in Sebastopol.  Large rooms and pretty private pool area.  Walking distance to everything in town.  Highly recommend if you are in Sebastopol for any event.</review>

Nice place. The place kinda feels like home. Cozy place. It’s clean and well managed and comes with Keurig coffee machine and cups, plus all the usual soaps and stuff. I can’t remember if they had a breakfast buffet but there is plenty of nice restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was reasonable priced too. I would definitely stay here again.</Review>

This place was cute and nice 20 years ago. Now, the sheets are Kleenex weight, the grounds are unkempt, the rooms have virtually the same drapes from 20+ years ago. It feels unclean.
The location is great, and Sebastopol could use it to be updated and cared for again. It’s sad.<//review>

customers are not important to this hotel management. We wanted to check out and were told we couldn’t expect a refund because our room had been cleaned. That was ok but we returned to find our room not clean. The manager was no longer available to address the unclean room or check out question and  check in clerk was not able to help. No authority and no manger available. I think that is convenient for them. The hotel room is on line for 127-150.00 yet we were charged 200 and that was with a chambers of commerce coupon.  To many inconsistencies and no one of authority to make decisions. Poorly run place for 250.00 a night.  I hope your experience is better.  I suggest you check the room first. Our mattress is sinking in the middle.  It is convenient to town but it is a pretty small town to begin with.< /Text>

From carpet to ceiling the room was comfortable and clean, especially the bed. My wife wanted to take it home.  The motel is located in a good part of town and is very close to downtown.<//review>< Date>

Ask to see your room before giving them your card. The bathroom in ours was disgusting so we asked for a different room. They didn't have one available so we left. Still waiting for manager to refund (front desk crew can't issue refunds apparently). We'll cancel the charge from credit card if needed.</Review>

Stayed for 5 night in mid August. Great location to stay for our event in the area. The Inn is right across the street from the Community Market a local grocery store, and right near walking/biking trails.
Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The bed was on a platform (which made it quiet).
Though the Inn posts quiet time beginning at 10pm, on Friday during our stay some folks were hanging out on a shared porch talking and were easily heard in our room at 11:00pm. Also, about 12:30 to 1:00pm on a couple of nights, someone upstairs seemed to be walking around and perhaps rearranging furniture. I can easily sleep with earplugs so I did not lose too much sleep.
We did not use the pool and spa but these did look inviting.
I would stay at the Sebastopol Inn again, but hope my wife gets some fitted earplugs for herself.
This was our first time in Sebastopol and we loved it. We went to several restaurants that we would gladly visit again, yum!</Text>

Traveling through and stopped in for one night on a Monday. Very nice! Large rooms. Very comfortable beds. Great WIFI coverage throughout the area with high throughput. Quiet area. Loved the water flowing in the courtyard fountain at night, especially with the window open to my room. Pleasant to sit out on the benches in the courtyard in the cool evening. Nice service at the desk. I'd definitely be back.<//review>

Extremely good location and reasonably priced.
However, a good step below a Best Western in service. No breakfast. Just coffee in the rooms. No drinks for kids like hot chocolate. Tea bags looked like theyd been sitting out and played with for a long time.
Had a 2 bed room. Booked for 4 people and confirmed my reservation. But still only had 2 towels in my room.  WORSE the front desk woman at 7pm on 1-5-2017, hassled me about getting another towel.<//text>

<Text>I absolutely loved my stay, and will definitely be going back. I met the friendliest people, and had the nicest time. The hotel isn't really anything special, but it isn't dirty or gross in any way. The beds are soft, the atmosphere is great, and the location is perfect. Everything is in walking distance, and there are plenty of friendly people to help with directions! The hotel didn't earn 5 stars from me because it's just not super nice. Don't get me wrong, I loved the place. But I wouldn't award a 5 star review unless the thing was absolutely perfect.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Nice trellis out front, and pool.  Friendly staff.  I liked how the toilet and shower are not in the same room as the sink.  The location is ideal for walking to dozens of places downtown.< /Review>

The dishes were good but a tiny bit salty for my taste and what I thought the Shanghainess dishes taste in general.< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>We came hee for their xiao long boa aka soup dumplings.   The dumplings broke when trying to take them off the stream tray.  That's a big no no as the whole point is to get the soup first when eating the dumplings.   All the dishes where ok, but everything was in the pricy side.   No rice came with the dishes so you pay extra for that too. Service wasn't good and we were asked to pay before we finished eating so they could do their lunch tally.</Review>< user_id>

<text>This is a great spot if you have a short amount of time and you want some quality Shanghai food. Their dumplings are fair portions and made really well. It is very good but be cautious when biting into one because some of them are so juicy you could potentially get soup all over yourself. The service is fast and efficient and the staff is friendly. Parking can be tough so come early or come prepared.< /text><name>Yamami Studios</name><Rate>4< /Rate>< pictures>

<Review>I've lived in this area all my life and I only wish I came here sooner. Their xiaolongbao is made fresh and not frozen, tastes amazing with plenty of soup. It is also cheaper than most other stores. I only know a few places with non-frozen xiaolongbao and they are far or expensive, except for this place. Their sheng jian bao was also pretty good, but I wish there was more soup in them. The wonton soup was also one of the best i've had.< /Review>< Time>

<Text>The Xiao Long Bao's here live up to the restaurant's name. We have been coming here for years and the consistency is spot on.
They're always filled with a good amount of soup and the dough is just the right thickness, so they don't break open when picking them up. Closed on Tuesdays.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Used to come here often for lunch when worked around the area but not anymore so wanted to visit on the way driving from SF. Easy off highway, easy street parking. My first xiao long bao was here maybe 6ish years ago, so it's kind of a favorite for that. They are pretty good xiao long bao. Also like the bean curd sheet with pork, the beef with shitakes, hmm I can't think of the proper names of the dishes.... But good, you can order by photo for some tasty items.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<rate>3<//rate><Text>You can't go to a place called Xiao Long Bao Kitchen and not order the aforementioned dish, so of course I had the xiao long bao along with the Shanghai boiled dumplings with shrimp. The XLB were juicy and all in tact, but the pork and soup inside lacked some flavor. The complementing vinegar sauce was delicious, with pieces of shredded ginger. The boiled pork and shrimp dumplings were large, but as with the XLBs, lacked some flavor. The accompanying sauce had a red tint to it, which made me think it was spicy, but I was pleasantly surprised. The sauce was without spice and delicious with the boiled dumplings. As with other traditional Chinese places, you can expect complementary tea with the meal, which was pretty affordable. $8 for 8 XLBs or 10 boiled dumplings!

This place was okay, but my top choice for dumplings in SSF will still be Dumpling Empire. Gave this place a try because Dumpling Empire is closed on Wednesdays and Kingdom of Dumpling in the Sunset seemed too far for my dumpling cravings.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) For Latinos, the service does not work, because what you have left over you have to put in the boxes. And the waitress has to call her asta to pay. And the place did not have many people. The tables of the other Chinese customers with white tablecloths. And cloth napkins. And to us a paper napkin ... I will never return. ..

(Original)
Para los latinos no sirve el servicio.pues lo que sobra uno lo tiene que poner en las cajitas.y la mesera tienes que llamarla asta para pagar.y el lugar ni tenia muchagenten.las mesas de los demas clientes chinos con mantel blanco. Y servilletss de tela.y a nosotros una servilleta de papel..jamas vuelvo. ..</review>

<text>Clean, modern, on point, trendy Safeway with everything you could ever want and more.  Whether it's fresh seafood, hot freshly baked breads, crisp fresh fruit and vegetables, amazing floral department and so much more, this store had it.  This is a flagship store and it shows in spades, they get it and they work hard to create an experience better than most of not so grocery stores.  This is the new standard and high bar offering convenience and quality you can't find elsewhere.<//text><Time>1573495055938</Time>< GmapID>

Can't even give 1 star,and I shop this store all the time.I bought chicken tenders at in store counter granted it was $5.00 fri.this past wk.Iwas having a couple of people so I bought several lbs. When I went to serve ( 20 min.later) they were hard so much batting and so dry the people couldn't eat them.I had to put together a meat with the salads and sides I was serving.I will never buy them again there.Not to mention I had to tell them from Safeway on Hamilton in Campbell.I am hoping some one callsl me back or at least e-mails me.   In order to post this I had to give 1 star .< /text>

Safeway shops well.  The employees are good about wearing masks and keeping distance. They are also accurate in their shopping. I prefer the curbside pick up over delivery by the other guys.  Thank you!<//Text>

The Safeway on Hamilton is one of the nicer ones. It's a bit more spacious, making it better to navigate through the aisles. The only thing I don't like is the how the  produce area is laid out.<//Text>

Also, we requested "No Substitution" on many items but were substituted anyway.  $6.49 for Asian Celery when we ordered regular celery!  Come on man!!!

A lot of good deals, great gift card selection, greeting cards and floral designs.
Starbucks is conveniently located in the store where Kali is so nice and quick to serve coffee.
The bakery has a variety of cake slices, breads, brownies, etc that are so yummy.  The fresh strawberry filled white sheet cake is delicious too.

<Text>I always come to this Safeway for all my grocery and supply needs. The produce always seems pretty fresh which isn't the case for some other grocery chains.  There is also always a lot of checkout lanes open so it doesn't take too long to get through the lines.< /Text>< pictures>

This Safeway is very nicely kept and organized. I have never had any issues with employees but I can't say the same for the neighborhood shoppers. They are not very friendly and by the looks and vibes given by them they dislike outsiders.< /text>

If I could I would have given this safeway a -10 rating & zero stars.. went by to pick up a few things. Made it outside to my car. Had pulled up on the corner right next to the tables & chairs. Loaded my car & left the cart right on the corner (right on the other side of where they put collected carts)..then a short, dark haired employee aggressively grab the cart & with a very rude & Condescending Attitude said "couldn't have put the cart closer huh" while shaking their head. I was completely shocked. 1st of all I'm pretty sure its your job as a cart collector to grab the carts and if you're so miserable at doing your job then you shouldn't be in a customer service position. Then on top of that, they had the nerve to wave & say again with a very Snotty & rude Attitude "have a nice day" as I drove away. Will not be returning to this safeway</Review>

This Safeway is one of the biggest and cleanest stores that I have ever seen.  Their inventory is simply amazing with an incredible selection to choose from.  Not to  mention their great customer service.  Kudos to the management for having a superb staff.  This is why I don't patronize other similar companies.< /text>

I wasn't really able to get what I wanted cuz they only had part of the things I needed. Its just not like the Stevens Creek and Lawrence Expressway  store...that store is awesome.

I like this Safeway better because they have shopping baskets for me to use when I only need to buy a couple of things.
What is that you said? All grocery stores have shopping baskets? I have to disagree. The other Safeway store I used to go to consistently always never ever had shopping baskets. Ghetto. :/<//review>

Location is well-stilocked and clean. However, they are usually understaffed after 8:00 AM, so I would recommend using the self checkout line most times.
Covid-19: store has a good setup on place, offers curbside pick-up, and requires a mask for all customers. Senior Citizen hoirs every Tuesday and Thursday mornings.< /text>

It’s a ginormous grocery store that has almost everything you need.  Good sales, but a bit expensive if the item is not on sale.  And well stocked!  But good goddess it takes  foreeeeeever to check out.  Like, add 20 minutes to your trip because there is never enough check out people.  Ever.  We stop here a couple times a week at different hours and days, so there is plenty of time variation on our experiences. Well stocked stores don’t mean ish, if people can’t shop without taking a loan out from Father Time.  Don’t be so stingy Safeway, and put an extra cashier on the floor.<//text>

Our neighborhood store couldn't be more awesome. Employees are always friendly and available. The plus is the just for u prices which are a big bang around these holidays. I recently downloaded the app and the discounts are just killer 🤗</Text>

<Review>24 hours! Daytime shopping is excellent. Usually well stocked. Friendly service. Good parking! Has multiple fun "car" double carts for people with kids. Docked a star for evening shopping. 24 hour location, but starts restock at 9pm. Couldn't get around the store well, multiple aisles blocked to the point I couldn't fit my body through, let alone a cart.<//Review>< pics>

This Safeway is one of the nicest around.
Big and clean with a great selection.
This location has a bakery, deli, pharmacy, and floral department. There is an on site butcher and an in-store Starbucks and lounge area as well.
The produce, bakery and deli are always fresh. Customer service is Excellent.
Parking is abundant and there is also a large Safeway fueling gas station on the opposite end of the parking lot.<//Review>

Went to regular checkout at night and was told that I have to use self-service unless I buy alcohol. Lots of fun with several items of produce, machine complaining that I need assistance, usual. So I guess I need to start drinking to not have to be my own checker.< /text>

<text>They have a good selection of items here. Prices are not too bad. However they stopped carrying cake flour here so now I have to make multiple stops for my baking needs. The employees are always friendly and helpful.< /text>< rate>

But the worst part is it is excruciatingly difficult to check out. Every time I go there long lines clogging the checkout. Last time I went all self-checkout computers went down while I was in line.

Good Safeway.  Not as good as the other Safeway in town ( Hamilton Ave. ) and they are usually out of a lot of things.  I rarely shop here but when I do I go for the usual items which they usually have, but if you want  specific items definitely shop at the one on Hamilton Ave.< /review>

Customer service getting worse. No baggers. Checkers have to bag the groceries. Card swipe/chip reader times out due to checker having to bag groceries. If you like incompetence, then this is the store for you.< /review>

It has a fantastic selection of quality produce, an onsite butcher, nice selection of fish, and a wide array of general groceries and home sundries.  They also have a competitively priced gas station.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Avoid the seafood/meat department if you can. I asked if they could cut the fish into smaller pieces and they said the counter had bleach on it, so they couldn't cut it. Not to mention that the guy who packed my meat didn't have gloves on. Seriously? Rest of the place is fine, cashier was polite, but the seafood/meat department experience was abysmal. Not< /Review>

Your store Hamilton is a disaster.  No ad items on the shelves.   Ask a clerk if you can find one and they give you a rude answer.   This store has a lot of problems.  The problems  today are not the first time I have encountered problems in this store.   You better look at your help including the manager.</review>

At the time they supposed to deliver they called and told me that they cannot deliver due to a high demand (didn't they know the demand at the time I ordered?).

One of the rare Safeway locations with a Gas Station, new store format with a very large deli including a Starbucks and a sushi counter.  No bank inside, but there is a Citibank branch in the Plaza. Lots of parking.  The customer service is good and friendly.  But you may want to check expiration dates,  I found several packages in the lunch meats that were expired.<//review>

<Time>1516472744516</Time><response>None< /response><Rate>2</Rate><text>This paricular Safeway (Hamilton Ave) has gone seriously downhill over the last year. Stocking in all key areas  (produce, meats, dairy & eggs) has become horrible. Literally every week they come up short on 30 to 50% of items that are being advertised. In a recent visit looking for an advertised special on cage free eggs I came across a completely vacant egg display with about 1/2 dozen customers all wondering what the heck was going on. I got a senior store rep ( looked like the overall store manager ) and asked for help. He flat out said "sorry, I don't have anyone to help you right now". Not one to be shy about pressing, I did. He denied providing any help again, leaving an aisle full of customers with looks of confusion. I hate writing reviews but it's time this place started getting help to run right. Note: I have talked to MANY line level employees in all the areas I mentioned above and every one tells me they order what they need but that management and the warehouse routinely screw them. That leaves them making promises to customers that they have zero ability to ensure are kept.<//text></record>

<review>This place doesn't really carry what I want anymore and when I asked him to order it they told me they would but then it turned out that they decided not to and didn't bother to tell me. The night manager here is rather surly and unhelpful in fact I think she should be fired immediately or at least sent back for retraining.

The store has not improved at all. In fact it's actually managed to get worse. You go to the deli counter to get help and the employees just sit there and stare at you and ignore you. They never have what you want. this store is horrible and I do not understand anybody that gives it a good review these people must be lying<//review><user_name>Jim W.< /user_name>< pics>

< review>
Cashier lines are always waaaay too long and a lot more could be done to improve them and open up extra lanes to get lots of customers out more quickly.  The gas station machines need a lot of work as well and are slow if they happen to work so you can take advantage of your Safeway gas points.  Lines are confusing when they get too long as you need to circle around the back parking lot by the Consignment store to line up and you may be forced to parallel park or use a pump with the hose on the opposite side of where you gas tank is located even though you can stretch the hoses but a bit tougher for an SUV.  They also never seem to have the items listed on sale on the app even when this is marked as your home store.<//review>

I was very pleased with Safeway employees who helped find certain items. Especially, at the meat dept the employees very pleasant and helpful. They were courteous and friendly I appreciate they assisted me accordingly.
I as a customer am very concerned about what Wal-Mart's mass lay off which I think greed beyond comprehension so I am boycotting Wal-Mart! So it is very helpful when Safeway employees are friendly and courteous.</review>

This used to be a great safeway, but in the last year it has gone way downhill.  I went for flowers & what they had on display were wilted and dying.  Half the time lately they don't even have what I am looking for.  Just an empty spot where the item "was".< /Review>

My go-to local Safeway.
It's nicer and has a better selection than the one on Winchester, and the staff is usually pretty friendly.
I prefer to shop here after 9pm because I hate crowds 😊<//text>

Nice, newer large Safeway with a gas station.  However, the selection of organic fruits and vegetables is less than 25 percent of what is available at the Cottle Road location. They also do not have a section for organic dried fruits. Some other departments are also a bit thin for the size of the store. If you are in the area the Cottle Road location is where you want to shop.< /Text>

< review>
There are several Safeways and even more grocery stores to choose from in the Campbell area but I usually find myself at this location if I need groceries. As a newer development I think its generally cleaner and more organized them some of the other locations. Prices are comparable to any other big chain grocery store and there is a lot of floor space allowing for a a good selection of most common items. There is a lot of parking and even a gas station in the same lot so its a rather convenient stop.< /review>

The Safeway at Budd and Winchester is pathetic. No carts available at the entrance, produce looks like leftovers, sale items on shelves are always gone, deli is pathetic with no one there to ever help you, bakery never has anything but French bread. Butcher shop is top notch, the only part of the whole store that seems to know what they're doing. Then you go to check out. 15 people in both lines! BOTH lines! They never have more than 2 lines open. Disgusting waste of time to go there.< /text>

Two! Two checkout counters open during Thursday evening rush hours. Waited for 30 minutes to get my ice cream to the counter. What a disappointment!

Edit: management made an effort to make things right by offering $5 off the entire bill.< /Text>

Hamilton Ave Campbell used to be a very nice store but changed 1-2 years ago. Now Each time I ask myself Why should I keep coming when it is so frustrating to shop. I've been a customer of Safeway for about 40 years spending $150 - $200 per week. So disappointed and frustrated.< /text>

<review>The thing I really like about this Safeway is that they have a lot of great food and I will have a fresh food and you know the other thing is is that they have lots of great fruit that's been chopped up for you so you can just go and get a quick bite to eat and run out the door</review>< Date>

Safeway's (ALL) in general need more staff! It's ridiculously crowded at check out stands.
This is my local Safeway and I'd much rather travel to a different location to shop. The lines are ridiculously long, I mean the quality of professional staff is little to none. Not to mention, the staff members complaining of being "short staffed" to their customers. This of course is a personnal issue and should be fixed with management but sadly is not. They do "stocking" during odd hours which of course lead to packed isles. The butcher is ruud! The produce selection is scattered.
SIMPLY AVOID THIS SAFEWAY. That is all.</text>

<Text>Two! Two checkout counters open during Thursday evening rush hours. Waited for 30 minutes to get my ice cream to the counter. What a disappointment!

Edit: management made an effort to make things right by offering $5 off the entire bill.</Text><resp>None</resp>< user>

Do NOT use a debit card at the pump!!! Their new system will charge you for the gas *and* put a separate $125 hold on your account!!!< /Review>

The thing I really like about this Safeway is that they have a lot of great food and I will have a fresh food and you know the other thing is is that they have lots of great fruit that's been chopped up for you so you can just go and get a quick bite to eat and run out the door</text>

Terrible customer service at the deli. One employee behind the counter declined to help me, saying it was "not her job" to serve mac and cheese even though she was standing right next to it and no other employee was available. Meanwhile, I waited literally 20 minutes while another particularly inept employee struggled to make two sandwiches for the only other customer at the deli. I just moved to California from out-of-state last week and had never been in a Safeway before. I have no intention of visiting this location again.</Text>

Long lines. Cramped parking lot. Too much stuff in the aisles, creating traffic jams. Very erratic about availability of items. They put displays at the end of the checkout lanes so you can't pull your cart up to unload. It all makes for a miserable customer experience. Go elsewhere.</review>

Worst customer service by Angela. She  was rude and unprofessional.  She needs to get rid of her gum while she is taking to customer. And change her attitude. She should never work at guest service.</text>

They are way cheaper than safeway in terms of fruit and vegetables. Safeway has more options of course. Youncan still find cheap stuff in safeway too. It all depends what you are going to buy basically.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The aisles are constantly cluttered with DUMB displays that prevent accessing items or just having 2 way traffic. If not that then workers are stocking up or doing inventory. (This is between 9am and noon on weekends.) Prices are high too.

While some of the cashiers are great (fast and friendly) others just don't give a darn and are more concerned with their "shift ending in 10 minutes" or just look around instead bagging/checking. I even scolded one after her "put one item in a bag then look around" routine hit 5 times.

I didn't have this low opinion when the store was on winchester and payne.</review><rate>2< /rate>< name>

There is only ever two check stands open during rush hours and both lines end up pat the produce and into the isles. Safeway really needs to get their act together, this is ridiculous.< /text>

They have electrical problems. I get shocked at least 3-4 times every time I go there, especially in the produce area. This safeway is the closest grocery store to me but I will now be going out of my way to shop elsewhere.</text>

(Translated by Google) Safeway unmanned cash registers have poor performance. Moreover, the point of the male assistant who manages the unmanned cash register is also bad at this store.
