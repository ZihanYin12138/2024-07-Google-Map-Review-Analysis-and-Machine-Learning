That changed when I had an automobile injury and was referred to his practice to assist in the back, shoulder, neck and ankle pain.

First impression of Dr. Mark Dulberg is that of his thirty plus years in his practice, he has a fluid system in how he operates his business. In his approach I have confidence and trust in his method. He is prompt in communicating via text should you have questions or concerns and is flexible in scheduling appointments as first come first serve basis. Anna, his assistant is amazing; hablar espagnol y english.

Experiencing the unknown can be daunting; that’s how I walked into his facility. After fully putting trust in the process along with being consistent in following his recommended advice to practice at home, progress is attainable here.

Yet again, one month passed and Mark has still not stopped my spam. How lazy are you? just pick up the phone and call AT&T!

Well you see Mark! you've still not amended your emails! It's been a week again!
Why don't you answer?!
MARK!! you've been using my email for about 2 months now and I can't get in touch with you!
I know you've been to Europe, paid over $500 in phone charges to AT&T,  rented a car from Advantage and more.
You also stayed at Best Western Tours Center, Amboise FRANCE

Me and my daughter both came after our first car accident hurt and scared of what could be wrong . Dr.Dulberg made us feel comfortable and took time to make sure we understood our injuries the process to recovery and the need for stretches for a well recovery. He was very understanding with our schedule which helped with being able to complete our visits .  My daughter and I both are feeling great and have more knowledge on how to prevent any damage to our backs and how to stretch to keep everything strong . As soon as u walk in the door you are  greeted with a smile and such positive energy that assures you you are in great hands .</text>

DC Mark Dulburg was very attentive and helpful throughout the process of visiting him. He made sure I practiced the exercises that would help heal me in the estimated time along with the care he provided in the office. Sometimes I would go with my children and he would always give them treats at the end of the session. His secretary was also wonderful. She is always making great conversation and made sure the clients were well taken care of.< /Text>

I had never been to a chiropractor before I got in a serious car accident. I found Dr Dulberg on a referral from my attorney. I have had an excellent experience. He is extremely friendly and courteous and knowledgeable. I had to take off work for several weeks for my shoulder injury. Dr Dulberg was very supportive and kept me off work until I was ready to return. I recommend him very strongly.<//text>

I am a first time patient here and doctor Mark has met my expectations! He is very attentive and caring. I will definitely continue my treatment with him. I walked out feeling great, with less tension in my shoulder and upper back.</Text>

< review>
I rate Dr Dulberg 10 stars if I could! I have had nagging low back for 3 years. I have been prescribed 5 different medicines that never helped. I went to 2 other chiropractors and didn’t get any relief. Then I found Dr Dulberg had really good reviews so i thought I would try him. He was great from the first visit. He listens very carefully and had a totally different approach than any other doctor. He explained each visit what he was doing. He promised that if I came in for 8 treatments and followed his exercises I would feel better and he was right. I now stretch for 5 minutes twice s day and after a month i feel great!< /review>

I had a car accident 3 months ago. I saw my local MD 3 Times and got 3 different medications, which made me feel worse . Then my girlfriend referred me to Dr Dulberg .He explained I had to do a few specific exercises and follow his treatment and within 2 weeks I was starting to improve . Now 2 months later I saw him for the last time today and feel great .Dr Dulberg is very personable and made coming in for treatment fun and psinless .I recommend him very highly .<//Text>

< Review>
Dr. Dulberg is competent, compassionate ,and professional.   He will prescribe exercises for you to do to help relieve your pain, show you how to do them and has you follow along with him so that you do a competent job on your own. Dr. Dulberg came to my house when I was incapacitated  with a trimaleolar fracture of my ankle and was suffering from neck ,shoulder , and lower back pain as a result of my fall.
I have been to many chiropractors in my life , and Dr. Dulberg is at the top  of my list. I am so thankful that I found him in Richmond,CA.< /Review>

I had a great experience with Dr Dulberg. I was injured in an accident. He was very friendly and informative. He showed me exercises that at first I was skeptical about but after 4 or 5 visits they really helped. I still do them now if I feel some pain. He was always patient with me, and I felt he tested me like a family would treat someone they cared about. Very satisfied.< /Text>

Only went to this chiropractor 3 times before he talked to me very disrespectfully and I didn't appreciate that so now I go to another chiropractor now. "A real chiropractor" not a "let me crack your back and have a nice day chiropractor" smh I won't recommend anyone to go here<//text>

Dave Mitchell is an artist of his craft. Him and the other mechanics at this shop are committed, honest and knowledgable. It's so hard to find a mechanic that won't rip you off these days and Dave Mitchell and his crew are part of the rare breed that will not. It's not easy to operate a car shop for nearly half a century and to do it right and having the customers have a great experience. Definitely consider him and his shop for all your car maintenance needs.</text>

Dave is the most honest, hard-working car service we have ever used! My wife and her family have used
Dave’s service for around 20 years.

Do not waste your time and efforts with anybody else, he is the person you should go to get fixed what you need fixed.

He is quick and to the point in and out faster than any other service.

We love you Dave great job!!!< /text>

< Review>
Since I am not a novice in auto repair I will not give a 5 star. i.e. I do not know if I got a fair deal for my rear brake change.. I feel that I did, but I believe in the good of humanity.
I had great customer service, I was treated respectfully, I was able to make a same day appt, the customer waiting area was clean and did not stink, and I had some great conversations with a few people while I waited for my brakes to be replaced and my oil changed.</Review>

<Text>Extremely honest and knowledgeable staff. Dave (owner) cuts right through the fluff and gets you taken care of. Last time, my truck's lift gate was inoperable and Dave repaired the mechanism free of charge. Won't go anywhere else.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< userid>

I've been coming here for 7 years. I can't tell you how amazing it is to have a mechanic who's trustworthy and affordable. Dave will tell me what needs to be fixed and how urgent, or not, it is. He works quickly and his customer service and prices are better than any place I've been. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<//Review>

Mitchell Tire does a great job. The prices are good and they rotate tires with an oil change. They are always friendly and never pushy.< /Review>

<review>Dave Mitchell at Mitchell Tire Services provides excellent service EVERY time I bring my car in to him. This most recent trip happened to be a dead battery where the car had to be towed to his shop by AAA. Because  Dave is so honest and trustworthy, I know that I can just send my car off to be towed with the AAA mechanic and I know that Dave will handle everything on the other end. And that's exactly what happens every single visit. It's great having a mechanic that you can trust.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd2997b5302279:0xa95eabbe3eadabce</gmapID></record>

Got off work a little late and wanted to squeeze in to fix my flat but they let me know it was cutting it too close. Doug recommended another shop opened a little later so I wouldn't have to rush as much.

Just on customer service alone this place is great!  No wonder Google maps pinned this place for me. Definitely will update if I ever need service because they are now on my top choice place to go.< /Review>

Dave​ Mitchell and his crew are the best, most reliable, and definitely the most honest automotive repair shop to be found anywhere!  My family and I have relied on Mitchell's for tires and quality service for over 30 years.  If you're not going here you are going to the wrong place!</text>

<review>This is the best shop around! My whole family which includes Aunts, Uncles, Mother, Father, and cousins all take our cars here. I have been going here myself since 1991. I haven't found anyone more Honest and affordable. I now live in Irvine with children who are also now at driving age and I still drive back to take my vehicles to Dave. Their number is programmed in my cell phone. This is the best shop around! I truly believe it!

I have been taking our family cars, PT Cruiser and Toyota Corolla, to Mitchell Tire for several years now. It is always great to know that we can depend on an honest, reliable evaluation of whatever repairs our cars may need. From major repairs to minor maintenance we always can depend on good service and a fair price. I highly recommend them.</text>

Completely honest auto repair shop. Another customer asked about transmission fluid flush that he was told he needed from another place.  Owner explained to customer that for his vehicle the manufacturer recommended that it did not need to be flushed for the life of the transmission.<//review>

An honest mechanic.  No joke.  I have brought my car here on multiple occasions.  The staff is friendly, the work is good, and the prices are fair.</Text>

My dad went here in the 80's and 90's and i started going in the 90's, hes the HONEST mechanic. I wouldn't trust anyone else with my car. Many times he has sent me away without charging me. You don't find that anymore.</Text>

We have found a local mechanic !!!
I needed a battery and he had it installed in less then 1 hour. He is a neighborhood shop, who cares about his neighbors.
We will be back.<//Text>

<Text>Dave Mitchell has been my mechanic for over a decade. I now live in Murrieta and still take my cars to him in Anaheim down on Lincoln Avenue. Why?

Here are a few examples of the integrity at Mitchell Tire Service in conversations I remember:

"Dave, you don't need those front brakes yet, You've got a couple thousand miles left on them. Why don't you drive the car for a while and check with me in another month or so?"
"I was able to get that part for less than I estimated so you saved some money."
"No charge for that- we always cover our work on that."
Mitchell Tire Service has consistently looked out for the customer first. That's been my experience for as long as I've known them.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I went online to make appointment for passports renewal and website won’t let me make appointment for renewal only for new passport. I went to the post office the lady over she keep denying it’s renewal even though I’ve my kids old passport in my hand and she want me to make an appointment and explain her that i tried it’s won’t let me make it for renewal.

We as a parents waste our time. These people doesn’t understand that both parents have to come it’s not easy due to job schedule. It’s very easy for them to say no even it’s there website isn’t correct.

These people should have courtesy as they are working over there.<//text>< pics>

I was trying to get assistance with my passport application. There was a sign at a kiosk directing me to a website link to make an appointment. I went to the website link, and the page noted that the site was not available. So I stand in line to ask for assistance, that's when I proceeded to advise the postal clerk of the situation. First she interupted me  before I could all the details. After everything was said and done, she proceeded to make appointment for me, and I asked if she could change the sign, so other people can be advised of the problem with website, and just brushed it off.....I might find another place to go, I don't reward bad behavior.</text>

They have lost (2) priority mail packages in the last 30 days. Do not use this post office if you want your item to make it to it’s destination.
I have spoken to the post master there and only received excuses. No one wants to help locate your lost packages. Unacceptable!!!</review>

We like this postal office the most! Always receive the fast service and quick response.  All the clerks are super profession and handle for their job promptly. Really  organized facility with 24 hours self-service kiosk with AC on    | : =)  This is a most busy postal office around this area, with a fast pace workload,  they could arrange clerk to service as quick as they could when in the peak time. Thank you for all the services that you provided, US Post Office are the best, the personnel are SUPER HOT!!!<//Text>

Came in to ship a box that we had ready to go. Instead of being courteous and kind, there was one of these guys (named Henry) giving out stamps before the desk. He asks if we have tape, we said no. He then stated that they don't provide tape and that we have to buy it. I pointed out the guy at the counter, stating that he taped our package before. The oriental guy decided to make a fit and call the guy out asking if he ever gave tape to us all loud and in front of everyone.

This started a back and forth thing, with the guy claiming he never saw us before. Then saying "I don't care what they are saying! I didn't do that!" And the oriental guy laughs all loud and says "well she's saying you did!", Making everyone look at us and making us feel like we are some kind of thieves. Then the guy behind the counter decides to say "yeah well, you can't believe everything that someone says!".

All I said was that last time he taped it for us, in a very calm and respectable manner. But instead of politely saying they didn't, they make it a big freaking conversation/argument in front of us and everyone else treating us like liars and basically thieves.<//text>

Unbelievable! MELODY was just as awful as you can get.  She began to assist us with our passport renewal just fine, as some point she became irritated and told me in front of everyone else standing around that I needed to calm down with my attitude. She was so petty, she when as far as refusing to give my husband a paper clip.< /review>

<Text>Customer service varies. Sometimes I get people who are fairly patient and knowledgable, but often times I feel I'm denied very simple explanations, such as when I ask what type of shipping would be cheapest, or simple things, like having them tape a box shut for me because I ran out of tape at home.

Updated to 1 star: They put the wrong key in my locker for delivery and now I don’t have my package and the last two days have been a sunday and a holiday so I’m stuck flying out of town without my package. I thought keys were swapped but the other person did not have my key. Just kill me now honestly.</Text></record>

Worst Post Office ever!!!!
Their website says Passport hours are from 8:30 to :3:00pm, we have a 2 year old which requires both parents to come in together, my husband and I both took off work early to rush down to NPO to be there in time.
We get there at :2:30 and the lady at the Passport counter who I see there everyday is now selling stamps and tells me that Passport counter is Closed and to go see the Post Master “Tony” she tells me there’s nothing she can do she’ll get me a Supervisor the supervisor tells me that we should have gotten there by 2:45, when I tell her we’ve been there since 2:30 then she says oh well our Passport Clerk went home early, when I tell her no she didn’t she standing over there selling stamps! She’s oh you can go to Corona PO they’re open later...
So we rush to Corona P.O. all to be told that I bet we just came from Norco because they hear it all the time “, no one there to help us”
And that they lied to you all to get you out of their face. Corona P.O. has the same hours as everyone else. Norco Post Office supervisor will lie straight to your face!
Horrible horrible service!!!!
And the “Post Master Tony” is worthless and lied right along with her Supervisor.<//review>

I don't even know were to get started with this place. By far the worst customer service I've ever had in my life and it wasn't a 1 time occurance, its a everytime occurance. Today took the cake with the lazy ass supervisor Tenesha, pardon the spelling I'm not current with made up name spelling. I didn't get her last name because she ran off and some how none of the clerks know their supervisors last name (how convenient). If you don't have to go here don't you'll be much happier.< /text>

The mailbox at our shopping center was vandalized over 2 weeks ago and the post office will not deliver the mail to the 9 tenants onsite because the routes are timed, not sure how long they think that will take.  So all of the tenants have to go pick up the mail until the box is fixed until they can get their maintenance dept out there to handle it.   No one can tell you when it will be done, because they only have so many people and there has been a rash of vandalisms lately....The lack of service provided by the US postal service is unbelievable.  No wonder they are going broke, how do these people have jobs?< /Text>

If you need something from them you're better off finding the information anywhere else but here. constantly missing mail, getting other peoples mail in my po box, other people getting my mail in their po box. Packages delivered to the wrong people. I pay for a po box and half the time packages are put in the pacel lockers which is awesome. but usually im left with a note saying to come in during business hours to pick up. kind of hard to do when you start work before they open and get off after they close. Not to mention they have shorter hours than any post office ive ever been to.< /review><gmapID>0x80dcc9e7c1ef0e77:0x762e58e4377b69d0<//gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

Often my mail looks like it has been run over (tire tracks, dirt on the envelope).  I stopped mailing from the Norco post office and now drive to Corona when I have to mail something.</review>< Pics>

Not only that but they just sent everyone that was waiting in line home or to the next local office to finish their business.  Poor customer service.<//text>< Resp>

< review>
They lost my package. Depending on if they find it in the next 2 days like they said I'll probably change my review but like cmon ... package said it was on its way to my house and should be here by 8 pm . 2 days later I call and she tells me they might have lost it. How is that possible when it's on the way? Are they stealing?< /review>

I learned many years ago you can judge a Thai restaurant by the quality of their Larb salad. Just had the Larb salad number 6 spicy and it was perfect 👌. I also get fried rice there quite often and it never disappoints. I highly recommend this restaurant 👍👍👍<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>We called ahead to order takeaway and were told it would be about 20 minutes. We arrived 15 minutes later, paid and waited the additional 5 minutes or so for our food. The guy at the counter was very friendly and polite. We ordered Pad See Ew, Yellow Curry (not pictured), and Pineapple Fried Rice (without the shrimp). All three were delicious AND reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend Thai Chili House, and I will be going back the next time I’m craving Thai food.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I love this place I use to come here when I was a kid. This is the first Thai restaurant I've ever eaten at. Their curry is so good! The service is amazing still after all these years and I mean years! I'm close to my 30s now and I use to come here as a kid. Occasionally I make the 45 min drive here from Glendale to enjoy some good eats here. This place will not let you down. Also they give good portions I'm always asking for a togo box.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Best Thai Curry you'll get locally.
Yellow Curry is good with Chicken.
Red Curry is good with Duck (if you like duck).
Green Curry is good with beef.
Panang Curry is good with beef.

I regularly order the Shrimp Bacon or the Salt & Pepper Calamari for an advertiser.  Just damn good.

The rest of their food falls into what's normally good Thai food.<//text><response>None<//response><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>This place is pretty small and not too high end. They have been rude to me in the past and didn't get what I asked for. Asked for Thai iced tea and all they had was fresh hot brewed. So they instead added ice to it which doesn't work well with thai tea. They tried charging me for it and I told them I didn't get what I asked for so I refused. Last time I went there. The food's good though.< /Review><Name>Ryan Crane</Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>2</rating><Gmap_id>0x80c29a53da398ff7:0xc7cb49f2dd452217</Gmap_id>< date>

Hands down my favorite Thai place in the valley. Run by a family since its opening. Food is amazing from pad see ew, pad kee mao, pad prick king, even the salad dressing and Thai ice tea are amazing. They bring the heat But know when to scale it back and he knows his way with the wok. Perfect cook and slight char to the noodle dishes. I'm salivating...<//Review>

<review>Put in an order 1 hour 50 minutes ago.  Still waiting for my food.  I was told it would be 45 minutes.  I called after an hour, and they told me it was on its way.  I called again after 1 hour 45 minutes.  I was told it's on its way and that they person who took my order must have miscalculated the time.  I let her know that she took my order.
Not ordering from here again.
It's been 2 hours - the doorbell just rang.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Very bad customer service. No smile, no thanks & no apologies for being late. Instead the lady was mad on me for asking her twice how long it will take them to make the food. Had to wait an hour half for the food.  Once the guy who I believe is the owner of the Resturant yelled at me for not giving them enough tips for bad customer service & the was my last day in the restaurant. Request you guys to not go.< /review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>Not the best by far. I ordered the prick khing (a chicken with green beans and red peppers dish), I got only five pieces of bell pepper and about double chicken bites and about a pound of green beans! Some under cooked. Not worth the low price. Also the rice tasted like it'd been sitting there for hours uncovered. Won't be there again.< /Text>< pictures>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>It was utterly disgusting. The vegetables soggy, and on top of that, contaminated with hair in it.
It tastes nothing like thai food, and feels like they just throw packaged flavors together. I got the pad thai and it was so orange and tasted nothing like pad thai. By far the worst thai restaurant. .. actually the worst restaurant in general I've ever been to.< /Text>< Pictures>

i dont know what others are talking about. i've been going to this place for 5+ years now and it has not once failed me. The Pad Thai is the best i've ever tasted. i've tried several thai places and all their pad thai's are usually dry. This pad thai is full of sauce and goodness! My fav thai spot of all time. i drive 25 miles to eat here!</Review>

<Text>I wish I could give zero star. I called the customer service to schedule a delivery. They said it was done. One day later, I called again since there was no confirmation or something. Delivery was not scheduled. Waited for being transferred many times and disconnected 4 times. I spent 2 hours on the phone for NOTHING!!! Now, their phone line is dead. I am clearing my showroom: NO MORE COASTER products.

Packaging is awful. Too many damaged item. They are not getting them back now due to COVID-19. My money? Has to wait till everything gets back to NORMAL.< /Text>< Pictures>

<pics>None</pics><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I ordered a bunk bed about 6 or 7 weeks ago from Reeds Furniture. Coaster had it sitting in a truck for weeks because it wasn't convenient to send the bed out until the truck was full. Eventually after calling for weeks the bed was finally delivered to Reeds and they had to wait a few more days to schedule a delivery to me. The bed was supposed to be installed today, on a Sunday, but the box was missing the hardware. So now my kids have no bed to sleep on because we took them apart and disposed of them to make room for the new bed. Coaster is apparently unreachable on Sundays. So, Reeds left the bunk bed assembled in my daughters' room. All we needed to know was the hardware and we could've bought it. But they are slow, unreachable on weekends, and incompetent enough to not put the required hardware in with a piece of furniture. What if they put in the wrong hardware and the bed fell, injuring my daughters? I hope this hasn't happened to anyone.
To the company, I recommend you provide your retailers with 24/7 support for instances like this. My poor daughters, wife, and myself are all put out by this inconvenience. We had to move all of their clothes and toys into our room and have furniture waiting to be built and put in. Our whole house is waiting for this bunk bed installation before it can return to the room. And, I had to break a promise to them. A parent should never have to break a promise to their child(ren). I hold you,  Coaster Furniture (and Reed's Furniture... you should have checked the boxes if this is a known problem as well as known your manufacturers better), accountable for that broken promise to my daughters.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Date>1598547717937< /Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>This place is the jam. If you don’t know about it, your missing out. Great cuts by pretty much every barber(special shout out to Estrada)! Plus the look of the place is clean, and very modern. Usually they don’t do appointments and manage a first come first serve list method, but currently due to COVID it is a different story. While I love this place and have been coming for almost three years, language can be strong on any given day, and movies that may be played could be a bit mature. Buuuuuuttt doesn’t stop this place from being a bomb place to get your haircut. The barbers mean well, and it’s just a classic joint with a lot of flavor.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>My first time ever coming into this barbershop, I’m from out of town. They allowed me as a walk in without an appointment and the barber did a fine job cutting my hair. He paid extreme attention to detail and took his time to the cut looking perfect. This is not an in-and-out type shop. I would definitely recommend this place and I will certainly come back again another time.< /Text></record>

Got there early before they opened! Best time to get in! The service was great, the vibe in the shop was great, shop was clean,and well kept. All the guys were super quick to get set up and start the day! Conversation was great! But the attention to detail on THE CUT was outstanding!!! If I could give more stars I most definitely would! I have ultimately found the shop I will be going to for my CUT! Thank you guys for taking the time and pride in your work! It shows! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!<//text>

Took my 2 boys to get a haircut and upon entering i was greeted and told that my smaller son would not be able to get a haircut. The reason i was given was that he's small and would not cooperate. My 3 year old has regularly gotten haircuts and he does fine, they didn't even attempt to see if he would cooperate. Talk about customer discrimination. This place just lost 3 new customers, (my 2 sons and husband).<//Review>

<Review>Been coming here for 2 years, they cut my boyfriends and my sons hair,my son was 3 when we started coming here. They had great patience with him. They dont yell at children when they play with the pool table if your children aren't banging the balls into the table or messing up the sticks (have some respect).  They do cuss it says on the door for discretion, take your kids somewhere else if you dont want them to hear it,its a men's barber shop it's what they do. Once my baby is old enough they will do his hair too. Mauricio, Coltin, Jessica and Logan.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Cons....Kid that cut my hair was inexperienced.  He took close to an hour to do a fade.  He also had big headphones on while he was cutting my hair.  Everytime he asked me a question about how I wanted my hair and I would tell him he would say "huh?" because he couldn't hear me!  Fade lines were not good either.  Paid $20 for that cut.  Too overpriced and when I paid the kid handed me crumpled and waded up ones.  Pros...shop looks pretty cool inside.

Tried it once because it was close to my house.  Will not be going back.</text>

Waiting over 45 minutes with 4 people cutting hair and 3 people ahead of me.  Saw others walking in and order not followed.  Came in the next day in hopes to get in quick to see the same thing.  I walked in and was ignored with no one to help me.  Won't be giving them another chance.</review>

My boy isn't a fan of hair cuts but is totally ok with these guys. We have had a different barber everytime and happy with all of their work. Great price, good people and love the atmosphere. Thank you, The Cervantes family<//Review>

<rate>3</rate><review>I've been coming here a few times and so far I have not been very disappointed. The only things that I didn't really like was the closing times. Most days I'm pretty busy and by the end of the day I'd like to get a cut but you guys are already closed by then and it's not even that late, the sun is still out. The other thing is how unorganized it is, there's too much disorder that at times I've been skipped and had to wait about 2 hours to get my hair cut. Another problem is that out of all the guys that have cut my hair only one has asked me exactly what i wanted with detail and everything. Other times I get a cut that isn't really what I asked for but it looks nice so I run with it. I guess you guys can use more communication with your clients.</review><Time>1459030278252< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Cuts are kinda hit or miss. 1st cut was really good. 2nd wasn't what I asked for but it was ok-ish. Took all 3 of my boys on different days. 2 had good cuts, 1 was pretty good uip until he asked for the back to be squared off.  2 of my boys asked for squared on the back with 2 different barbers and ........... Let's just say I think we have different thoughts on "squared". So kind of a toss up. I'm going to try out the rest of the barbers there and hope for the best.<//text><Name>david rosales</Name>< Time>

I Like coming in to The Cut. Great guys and they get it right every time. Oscar and Eric andt the guys spend enough time to cut, shave and trim ear hairs,etc... and 'Manscape' you well.  They always do a great job and even my son enjoys coming here. This is a mens Barber lounge so Sometimes the language can be offensive and loud and music too, but that is to be expected. 'The Cut' is different from other shops. It Could use some kid friendly language -- when kids are around, but otherwise just fine. Keep it up guys. Great job.<//Review>

Me and my friend came in for a haircut and the barbers completely ignored what we wanted and gave us what they felt like giving us. Wasn't my first cut here with made me that much more disappointed. Now I have to grow out my hair to get rid of this haircut I didn't ask for.</text>

Horrible experienced! One of the barbers was talking crap in front of my child. Cursing and saying F words in front of a 6 year old child. What a disgusting human being. I used to take my boy here, but never again! Too unprofessional.< /Text>

States they close at 7:00 I show up at 6:36. They tell me they take the last customer at 6:30. I'm a new customer. How am I suppose to know that. They just lost 5 new customers. My four boys and my self.<//text>

<text>I have been a customer from the beginning because it was so close to home. I've tried alot of places, but I knew I found the right barber when I kept getting compliments on my haircut, on the regular. Eric (the owner) is a perfectionist when it comes to his craft, and in MY opinion one of the top barbers in the Inland Empire right now. It took me a long time to find the right barber, but now I won't let anyone touch my hair but The Cut MBL. Besides the actual haircut though, the atmosphere is the best part. Its a cool place to come with a couple friends and get a cut. I mean they have a line of shirts/hoodies/stickers, a pool table, flat screens all over, and even a shop chameleon lol. I definitely recommend this barber shop. Not to mention the Waba Grill, and liquor store right next door. Can't beat it.</text>< Gmap_id>

3 out of 10 times I've gotten sick almost immediately after eating there. I don't know if it was undercooked chicken or it was sitting too long. I am writing this while stuck in a restroom because of it. I will not be going back.< /text>

Good flame broiler in OC ! Employees are friendly and well trained. Place is clean and operates like a well oiled machine. Good (quality food ( relatively speaking here people,  $8 for beef plate ) and healthy if you can resist the secret sauce ! I always get the beef plate with vegetables.</review>

It gets really crowded when the high school gets out. Staff aren't as attentive and service could be better. I come here for the half and half bowl. Love their secret sauce.<//Review>

< Review>
The worst tasting chicken  from flame boiler ! The chicken was hard, like it was days old. Guys go to the one on Beach. The magic sauce was sooo salty. This is my first and will be my last time I go here .</Review>

Melissa J is very helpful. She took care of us quickly and efficiently. 5 stars for melissa!
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟... 3 stars for veronica's ins company for the 3 incompetent employees that dropped the ball numerous times and could not help us with a simple autopay card change. Melissa helped us in 5 mins.< /text>

<Text>I came to Veronica's Insurance not knowing I would leave with a great deal. Kassandra gave me the best help with excellent customer service. I tried getting quotes from other insurance companies, but Kassandra went above and beyond to help me get the best deal. Definitely recommend to friends and family.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I love Veronica's Insurance in this location. It has great discounts and options for my auto insurance. I love the customer service there a lot especially the employee named Alejandra Torres. Alejandra is very experienced on what she is doing. She is very friendly and nice to all customer. She helped me with extreme patience and kindness through out my problem from start to end. Furthermore, Alejandra also makes me with calm and confident by listening to my story on what was going on. I deeply appreciate Alejandra, the employee, a lot.</Text><username>Sengthay Kaing< /username>< response>

Had an amazing experience at this location. I didn't feel like I was just being pushed to buy because I was a sale but that the agent Kassadra actually cared about my concerns and heard what I had to say. She took the time to ask questions and found me great coverage and at a price that fit rite into my budget that I was looking for, Highly recommend Kassandra and her team at Veronica's insurance In Pomona. Great Customer service!!< /Review>

<text>They get you a cheap price but take forever to see you. There was only one person here at 5:26p.m. with 3 empty desks. Get here earlier than this time I guess.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I walked into there office and the agents welcomed me and my wife with great attitude. Alejandra Torres was our agent who assisted us with every questioned we had. We ended up getting a great insurance policy and was very satisfied with her service. Thank you for your help. Plus the oldies music they play feels very relaxing. Love it< /Review>< Pics>

For 2 months straight they have tried to charge me fees that were totally there fault. One lady tells me a certain amount for payment so i get that ready to send then i think everything is good until i get a notice of late payment now its almost double the cost because the lady gave me the wrong price. Very unprofessional and unreliable. Now im considering switching companies. If they cant do their regular everyday job what makes me think they can assist me when i have an accident.</text>

Terrific Service in this  location was greeted with respect and promptly by the Manager Patty Gonzalez she was very patient and courteous handling our situation I have noticed at the other places they treat customer like a every day thing with no respect Patty was really helpful to me, I have recommended family members to this store already .

<Name>Leslie Medina</Name><text>I went into this location yesterday & all I have to say is that this place is garbage, one of the girls doesn't even speak proper English & the manager (Jorge) acts like he owns this place when I'm sure he cant even afford his car note. I was helped by Jorge for an auto quote after having a horrible experience through Fred Loya & this place made my shopping experience even worse, Jorge kept engaging in a flitarious manner which was completely unacceptable since his the manager & has to lead by example also he offered for me to put a good comment on YELP & google & he would take me out for lunch ridiculous.

<rate>5< /rate><Text>went into their office a few days ago and I was automatically greeted and helped. The manager Jorge explained everything in detail, answered all my questions, and was super patient with me which I appreciated very much. Overall Im really happy with the price Im paying for my insurance compared to what I was paying before with Geico and State Farm. The great customer service that I recieved put the cherry on top. Thank you Jorge you definetly deserve manager of the year award.< /Text>< Resp>

They have I think 5 or 6 desks and only 2 people, and one of them only spent watching his computer and did not serve the people we were expecting.

Fui hacer un pago de mi aseguransa, y me tuvieron esperando más de 1 hora, les hace falta más personal, o tal vez mas capacitacion, se supone q abren a las 10 am, y me atendieron después de las 11. Tienen creo 5 o 6 escritorios y sólo 2 personas, y una de ellas sólo se la paso viendo su computadora y no atendía a las personas q estábamos esperando.</text></record></dataset><record>

I was a little apprehensive at the outset.  Lori helped to reassure me that although the process can take time she would be available to make sure that things would move along to a satisfactory conclusion.  She responded promptly to all my inquirers and helped to minimize the hurdles.  I felt that she was with me through this entire ordeal.  My wife loves our newly restored kitchen.< /text>

I’ve been with Allstate for about 4 years now. The service has always been excellent. Recently my account was placed in another office. I was nervous wondering will I still receive that excellent service. But once I talked to Anthony Souza. He ensured me that the level of service would not change but get even better. I tested his words and emailed him several times. He responded with prompt emails. I’m so happy with the service and  I give kodos to Anthony thanks again.< /Review>

They have been my insurance agent for many, many years.  I deal primarily with Corina Pliske. She is knowledgeable, responsive, professional and a pleasure to deal with. They handle virtually all of my insurance needs and I am very happy with their service. I highly recommend them.< /review>

Have used Bob Souza insurance services for quite a few years now.  Bob and Laurie, along with the office staff have always been very responsive to any questions I may have along with all my insurance needs.  I have been completely satisfied with the Allstate response to any claims I have had and drive with the confidence, that if and when needed, my insurance company and it's staff are there for me.< /text>

I have had nothing but top notch service from this Allstate office. Anytime I have a question Patty (whom I highly recommend) is always very quick to return my call or notify me of savings I could directly benefit from.
Bob is also very involved in the day to day which is always a good thing, I know things are being done right. I've been insured through this office for 3 years and plan on staying for much much longer.<//text>

For the past two years this place keeps adding rate hikes, Shop around there's better places. Unfortunately I won't be able to switch my home insurance in time for the new 6mo. policy term but this will be the last term with this place. If you like almost $20 rate hikes for no reason then this is the place for you.</text>

<review>We have been a customer of the Bob Souza, Jr. Allstate office for over 20 years now. We wouldn’t have stayed if the customer service wasn’t the best! Questions are answered immediately. If they need to do some research, then they reply quickly- with the correct answer or solution- so that you know you don’t have to worry that things weren’t done right. We highly recommend Bob Souza, Jr. and his wonderful staff.</review>< Pictures>

Me and 2 of my friends all got scammed by him.

<review>After multiple attempts, I have given up on how UNRELIABLE when their doors are open.

Don't get me wrong, their tarts are fantastic. But it's not worth your trouble if every attempt to visit, they're CLOSED.

Instead, I've been going to Cherry Blossom bakery on Clement St (Outer Richmond) for their egg tarts.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Highly overrated! I heard a lot of good things about this place, and they always have a long line! I was lucky enough that there was no line when I arrived. I bought an egg tart, which is what they are famous for! WOW, $2.5 for an egg tart (highly over priced)! If I pay for this price, the egg tart better be good! Unfortunately, I can tell that it was over baked by the way it looks! It is warm and fresh, but nothing worth $2.5!

I guess when you have nothing to compare, this is the best place for egg tarts (I am sorry to say that I am a baker. I am proud to say that I bake better egg tarts than this place, and I don't charge $2.5 per egg tart)!<//Text><resp>None</resp><rate>2</rate>< user_id>

Chinese pastry delights. The eggs tarts are really good. The soft and had a very smooth texture with a fluffy crust.

Ordered the sesame ball and the custard puff too. Sesame ball was okay, can give it a miss if you have tried it before. Custard puff was good but nothing to wow about.

Queue can be about 10 mins when at it extends to the next stall.</Text>

Very tasty treats can be found at this bakery. If visiting, expect a rather long line. Would highly recommend the egg custard tarts. Don't forget to eat while they're warm!</Review>

<review>Best egg tart in town. They increased the price by a quarter to $2.50 per egg tart, and $30 per dozen.

Moon cake is another popular item here. I personally like their pineapple moon cake with salty egg yolk.

They often takes months off, and if they open they usually open from noon to around 6 or 8pm, and off 2 days during weekdays.

Cash only!<//review>< Pics>

This place is known for their flaky, delicious egg tarts and baked pastries. The crust for all their baked goods is buttery and phenomenal!  The negatives of this place include: long lines (need to wait at least 15-20 minutes before it's your turn), inconsistent operating hours (even though the door sign says 10am, sometimes they don't open until 11am; same with closing hours, sometimes they close at 3pm, 4pm, 5pm, other times they are just not open at all), egg tarts and the other baked goods are now $2.50 each (more expensive than the other bakeries).  The AA bakery around the corner of Jackson and Stockton (1068 stockton) has great egg tarts too, and it's only $1.25. Rather go there than Golden Gate, you dont need to wait in line, and they are always open.<//Text>

<review>The line moves quickly and the ladies behind the counter were very sweet. The egg tarts must be of a superior quality as people stand in a long line for them. I expected them to taste  "custardy" or flan-like which they do not. The taste of egg is very strong if you have not tasted them before.< /review>< pictures>

Hands down from my own experience, this is the best egg tart. Their crust is one of a kind and the filling is balanced with egg yolks and the right amount of sweetness.< /Text>

<Text>Rule 1: Do not believe their opening hours posted online. They open and closed whenever they feel like it. On our first day they open at noon, the next day it was 1:30pm, the next day after was closed. 😱

Rule 2: If they are open expect to wait 30-60 minutes.

Rule3: Buy 1-2 extra egg tarts than you wanted, you will thank me later.

Their egg tarts are $2.50@, comparing to other bakery at $1.25. Not sure they are twice as tasty.

This place is a dump, they have not clean or update the place since the gold rush. They must be the most profitable place in all of Chinatown. 😎< /Text>< Pics>

This is part of my culinary tour with out of guests.  Great place for a sugar pick me up before hitting Chinatown.  I go for the dan tat (egg tart) but I also pick up the coconut pastry.

The line is always long so be prepared to wait.  I especially love it when the egg tarts come right out of the oven.<//Review>

If you're looking for the famous custard egg tarts, do NOT trust the open and close hours listed on Google. They also randomly close, so the best way to catch these scrumptious tarts is to check first thing in the morning on the store's door if they've posted when the egg tarts will be available. Be careful, they may sell out quickly so don't delay!

The flaky, lightly sweet egg tarts are heavenly and if you are lucky enough to try it fresh, you may end up eating a whole box in one sitting! The price is a little more expensive compared to other Chinatown bakeries, but it is well worth it! A dozen (one pink box) is $30 or $2.50 for each individual tart.< /review>

I can't believe they're open for once! I've been flying up to the Bay area from LA quite frequently and they're always conveniently on vacation when I visit. I swear they do it on purpose but I'm glad I got to experience their famous egg tarts for once. Hailing from LA, we've got a lot of Hong Kong dim sum restaurants in the 626 but they can't compare to those up in SF. Historically, Chinese immigrants settled up north for the railroads before coming down to LA and I feel like those ancestors established different Chinese cuisine than those down in LA. Not only does it taste different, the people who make them are different.

Enough with the history lesson, let's get down to business. The egg tarts here has a flaky crust all around and an extremely hot core when you take your first bite. I have never tasted any egg tart fresh off the oven and straight into my mouth. For a box of 12, $30 may seem steep but it's worth it. I can see why the business owners take so many vacations throughout the year. You must try this place out of your ever in SF and only if they're open, which usually is 50/50.</review>

Was walking through Chinatown on a Sunday and saw a queue, the head of which was outside the Golden Gate Bakery, I had heard of them and decided to join the queue as it was pure luck I was there when it was open as the opening times are random and they close up for months at a time for vacation. The 30 minutes wait was well worth it the egg tarts were amazing, the coconut cookies great, and the sesame seed bun good too. Egg tarts are $2.50 each but as a treat worth it. They only take cash but there are a couple of banks over the road so no big deal.< /text>

<text>Yes. This place is good. They're always closed because they don't need the money. BUT! If you catch them open, you better wait in line. These little flaky tarts are worth making a trip for. If I'm even sort of close by I'll go out of my way to check if they're open. They tend to be open close to Chinese holidays incase you're having trouble getting your hands on these tarts.</text></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I dropped by here to see why there was a line up in the bakery.  People were buying Golden Gate Bakery egg tarts.  Therefore, we bought couple as well as a cupcake at $2.75 each.  The egg tarts are warm and fresh.  The tart layer was crisp and flaky.  I do find the egg tarts to be pricey at $2.75 each.  There's not much difference between the egg tarts here and the ones I have in Vancouver or Hong Kong.<//review>

If you want tasty good egg tarts, this is the place to get them but you have to be patient enough to wait in a long line to buy them here. My friends recommended this place when I visited the Bay area. I gave only 3 stars for this visit because their customer service was not that good... the ladies who's serving there were not friendly, they seemed to argue over something all the while we were waiting to be served. Oh ya, no picture taken allowed inside the store.<//Text>

< Review>
I visited between lunch and dinner on a Wednesday afternoon. It wasn't very busy when I walked up and I lucked out because they still had warm egg tarts. At $2.50 apiece they're more expensive than I'm accustomed to but they are well worth the price. As far as I know, egg tarts typically have crusts similar to pie crusts or flaky crusts. The Golden Gate Bakery egg tarts have flaky crusts but the layers are so tightly packed I thought they were like a pie crust at first sight. The layers are buttery and savory which pairs well with the eggy, silky smooth custard. I only bought 2 but next time I'm in town, I'm buying many more.< /Review>

<Review>I love their patisserie and coffee. I was here right before going to labor for my baby#3. My baby seems like didn't wanna pop out of my tummy. Kept getting rejected by the hospital.

So I was craving for some chocolate and patisseries so we came across here. While enjoying my mocha and chocolate croissant I begin to feel my baby #3 wanna pop out! LOL. So quickly we ordered some Togo and went straight to the hospital. Baby popped out the next day'<//Review>< pictures>

This is a popular stop in Chinatown to buy freshly baked egg tarts. There is usually a queue and the shop is erratic in opening hours. So try your luck and charm with the lady boss !< /review>

Egg tarts. Flaky crispy crust, warm eggy filling. I'm drooling thinking about it. If you like the flaky crust style of egg tarts, you'll love golden gate bakery. The egg tarts cost about $2.15 each currently.<//Review>

The bakery is famous for being on vacation so I wasn't holding my breath when we showed up at the shop on a Friday morning.  Yelp listed opening at 8am, but they were still closed at 8:30am.  We were trying to figure out what to do next as a lady tried getting into the bakery and then a second lady showed up to open the doors.  We took the opp to ask when they would be open and she told us to come back at 12pm.

We were able to come back about 4pm and got in the line that had already formed out the door.  We waited about 30 minutes in anticipation.  We just didn't know how many egg tarts were left.  But luckily tray after tray arrived even with customers ordering dozens at a time.

Once we got our mitts on them, we ate one right outside the door.  They were amazing and sooooo good hot.  They are also really good cold.  Each tart sells for only $1.95.  They also offer jin dui, rice cakes, and other Chinese pastries.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKij-dvK7h6QMawMrYCc50jxGJFeY9_sFfu9Ps=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwogkCaS0OLcWuCt_bbBwfnUx4n0x23Dd65XEg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

<Text>Delicious Macau-style egg custard tarts! Not quite as caramelized as some I've had in Shanghai (e.g. at Lillian's) but creamy filling and deliciously crispy shells. Their hours are frustratingly inconsistent--it's hard to tell whether and when they'll be open other than dropping by physically (some Twitter accounts try to keep track but they're also inconsistent). Today we thought they'd be open at 11 but found a sign saying they'd be open at 12. We arrived back at 11:50 to find a line of at least a dozen people already...they finally opened about 12:10 and we got served around 12:30. They also have a number of other pastries. Tarts are $2.50 each.<//Text><user>111600326518812216057<//user>< date>

Words can't describe the egg tart. It was melt-in-your mouth, comfort food, dessert and a meal, soul-fulfilling good. The ladies running the shop were wonderful, and the line and impromptu hours added to the experience for me.</Review>

Be prepared to wait. Best egg tarts in SF, and they know it. The ladies take their sweet time and customers are willing to wait for it. We waited over 45 mins, when we finally got in side with two parties in front of us it still took them 5 mins per customer cause they like small talk.< /Review>

< Review>
I’ve been here three times. First time it was closed even though the posted hours suggested that it should be open. Second time it was open but waited in line for 40 minutes. The egg tarts were amazing but cost $2.50 each, $1 more than the ones at Yummy Bakery and Cafe two blocks away with no line that are arguably just as good. Third time I was hesitant, but decided to stop by since I was in the area, and then I saw this sign that says “THREE WEEKS VACATION”. The best part about this sign is that it doesn’t even tell you when the vacation started or when they expect to reopen. I’ve seen a lot of arrogant businesses before, but this one wins the crown.

Are their egg tarts good? Absolutely! Is it worth the 40-minute wait, the 67% higher cost and the fact that they close whenever they choose without letting you know? You be the judge.<//Review>

Came here since I saw egg tarts were popular here. When we arrived in the evening there wasn't a line! So we were lucky :) I got 2 egg tarts and white lotus seed moon cake (non egg yolk) and the total was around $15.  The egg tarts were fresh and nice and warm but was a little more egg-y than I'm used to, but still yummy.  The moon cake, though, was soooo yummy even though they were out at room temperature.<//Text>

<Text>We stopped by for some egg tarts because the line wasn’t too long and they were actually open! They tasted fine but i don’t get how they are supposedly better than other tarts?

<Review>Been coming here for many years - never once have I seen this place without a line. Okay, maybe once.. but that was because they were closed for vacation / holidays (rarely happens). There is a good reason for that - this is probably the best egg tart you're going to have, counting Asia. They are the best fresh so my recommendation is to eat right after you get it while they are still hot. They have other stuff as well (wife cakes, lotus seed buns, etc) but those are definitely less amazing than the egg tarts.

PSA: This place is cash only. Make sure you have some!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>Their egg tarts own the spotlight. The crust has similar characteristics to a croissant, flakey and buttery yet somehow light. The egg custard is not too sweet and delicious!

It’s better to come on a weekday as line gets very long on the weekends.< /text><gmapID>0x808580f49eea8c29:0xed441d49b092b257</gmapID>< Name>

We had a sesame ball and the famous egg tart. Both pastries are delicious, very fluffy and perfect amount of sweetness. They are however on the pricier side ($2.5 per tart). There is always a line but the line moves quickly so don't be discouraged by the line. It's cash only so make sure you have cash with you!< /Text>

There always seems to be a line, but I think it's worth it! I passed by the bakery about 10 minutes before it opened at noon on a Saturday, and the line was short enough at the time, so I thought to try it out. The custard tarts are $2.50 per piece ($30 per dozen in a box). They're freshly baked as some had to wait a few minutes as they were ordering a dozen (I only wanted to try two pieces, so they let me have the two). It's flaky, creamy and really delicious! Cash only at this place, like most places in Chinatown it seems.< /Text>

Everything is very tasty! The egg tarts  are the best. There will be a long line to wait through so you need to be patient. Parking is a huge issue as you'll need to hunt for street parking. This place is located in the heart of Chinatown. Lots of foot traffic and car traffic.< /Review>

Custard tarts weren't great, didn't know about the hype till we saw people standing in line. There warm warm and fresh but don't think it's worth the wait. I had to stand only about 7-10 mins but don't think I'd do that again.
Maybe it's just my taste so I'd still recommend folks go over there and form their own opinion<//review>

<review>One of the best egg tart place that I’ve been to. The egg tart they have is as good as what I had back in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Remember! Cash only! Now the price is $2.75 for one, $33 for a dozen. Better finish the tart right after you purchased it. It’s not that good when it get cold.< /review>< GmapID>

All of them will bring the different taste for you. Maybe it is difficult to look out the cakes like that in American. It recall the teenage cakes for old Asian living here. You might be wait for a long time in line to enter the shop in busy time. But it is worth to do that if you want to enjoy something different.
It is one of the place we should come as coming San Francisco.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Best eggtart in San Francisco hands down...if you're willing to wait. The line, on weekends, will run you about 45 minutes, but if you've never tried their eggtarts, or if you're in need for your eggtart fix, it's well worth it. They have the perfect blend of flakiness in their crust and milky creaminess in their filling. How do they do it??? I've never had another eggtart as good as GG Bakery...doesn't make sense! Well, that's why there is a line and that's why there is a wait. The server and cashier is pretty rude though, you can tell they don't want to be there. And that is true a lot of times. If you're making a trip out here specifically to get their eggtarts or other baked goods, make sure to call them, or find out someway somehow, if they are open. They tend to go on vacation PRETTY OFTEN. Not even kidding. I guess when you've made a transcending recipe like that and become rich you'd take as many vacations as them as well. Egg tarts are a little on the pricey side too, of course, at just about $2/pc and $24/dozen. Their red bean sesame balls are pretty legit as well and their wifey cookies are good if they have them available.</text>< pics>

Very unique egg tarts, we waited in line for 40 minutes to an hour. There were two elderly ladies serving us once we were inside and they were super cute and friendly. I’ve been wanting to come here for a while and I’m happy to be able to come and try their egg tarts. I think it’s definitely worth the hype.

Be aware that they are close a lot, so call before coming here.<//Text>

Delicious egg tarts. Unpredictable days/hours of operation. If they are open, expect long lines. Moon cakes available around Autumn Moon Festival.</Text>

I have seen many reviews and recommendations about Golden Gate Bakery in tourist guides
However, Golden Gate Bakery not a TOURIST TRAP who know how to fool tourists. Both San Francisco locals and tourists loveeeee their egg tarts!
Also, you gonna be lucky enough to taste the egg tarts, because the owner lady will close the store A LOT for vocation.< /text>< Pics>

The best custard I have ever had, and hands down the tastiest, flakiest, butteriest crust I have ever had. It was worth almost missing my flight home to have the egg tart. Honestly, I would have gladly missed my flight home for it!< /text>

<Text>Yet again, Yelp successfully led me to a business with exactly what I was looking for: exceptionally delicious, freshly baked egg tarts.

Buying a dozen of the egg tarts at Golden Gate Bakery will set you back $30 in cold, hard cash; they accept cash only! The cost is currently $2.50 per tart.

I stepped into a line with about 15 people ahead of me, thinking the wait should not take more than 30 minutes. I was very wrong.  I realized about a half an hour in that I had only moved up in line because some people had lost hope and abandoned their quest for egg tarts. Since I had waited for some time already, I continued to stand in line as people constantly stared quizzically at the line as they walked and drove by.  Many passersby asked what we were waiting for and asked if the business was even open.

I understood why people kept thinking the bakery was closed. They have an interesting set up: one lady unlocks the bakery entrance door, pokes her head out, takes your order and your cash, closes and locks the door behind her, places the egg tarts into a box, one at a time, and unlocks the door once more to hand you your order. It is as if those egg tarts are kept more secure than money in a bank (kidding, somewhat...I'm sure their huge profits must need to be guarded as well).

This really was the best egg tart I have ever had. At other bakeries, the crust can be flavorless, but the crust on these were flakey and buttery. The tradeoff for these freshly baked egg tarts is the large quantity of time it takes them to prep one person's order. It seems like they could only fill a couple of people's orders at a time before having to wait another 20 minutes for the next batch to be ready.< /Text>< Pictures>

I got here around 3 and the place appeared closed, but the lady inside was still distributing preorders. Was only able to get a couple tarts. Super tasty since it was still warm. It was funny because you basically just hand her money through the door and she gives you a bag with the only thing they had left.<//text>

This place was insanely unique. With the bread factory right next door to the restaurant and windows looking in to see the bakers at work. When you go up to the counter to order your food, you can see a conveyor belt with baskets hanging on the ceiling, carrying loaves of freshly baked bread throughout the place. There is a gift shop and a separate counter just for buying their bread creations. It is usually bustling with activity, being right next to the bay and in the center of a popular tourist area. A little pricey but nearly everything is a little more expensive in San Fran. Very enjoyable and good food< /Text>

They have some pretty good egg tarts! The egg tarts have a flaky shell and the egg custard is smooth and delicious! These are some good egg tarts but I don't know if it's worth the high price point of $1.35.  To avoid the lines I would suggest going during the off hours of the weekdays because there can be a long wait. Also do try their other pastries. Their sponge cake with wafer is really good!<//Text>

Another classic San Francisco wait in line for the good stuff sort of place but whatever it's totally worth it the egg Tarts are to-die-for if anything it's just sad that you can't really do anything aside from consult a website to see when they're going to be open

If you were one of the Poor Unfortunate Souls who are traveling trying to get here to get some good good egg tart goodness and you realize that once you've gotten here it's not open please look elsewhere in town there plenty of places that sell egg Tarts know in advance that they won't be this good but whatever what can you do

I'm sure they have other items on the menu I have no idea what they are I've never going to buy them I just buy boxes and boxes of egg Tarts at a time though even put them in the paint code box for you time up with a bow cut the little corner in them so you didn't expire on the way home

So yeah go get you some egg tart goodness< /review>

The hype is real. We arrived 2 minutes before they opened to find a line up with approximately 15 guests outside. We waited for 20 minutes to try the famous egg tart... we must admit, they exceeded our expectations. They were so crispy on the outside and so incredibly soft in the middle! Usually very popular places tend to disappoint, however this place didn’t. I’m also a pretty impatient person but I’m glad I waited, well worth it! Also, my friend told me after that they normally close for 3 weeks at a time to go on vacation, I’m glad I came at a good time and was able to try it out!<//text>

You will come here only for one thing, and that's their egg tarts. They are undeniably the best in the city. Why the low rating you ask? Because they are never open. Yup. They are always on vacation. Good luck trying to come when they are open. And if you do make it down there when they are open, be prepared for a long line. They have also raised their egg tarts from what I remember as 75 cents to almost $2 each (I think it's $1.90 now). Sure ingredients and rent goes up but I don't think any places have raised the price of food by this amount as well. I guess it would explain how they can always afford to go on vacation.</text>

I love the egg custard tarts from this bakery...they are just the right amount sweet and the pastry is good and tasty too..I usually buy a dozen whenever I'm here because of two reasons really: a) they are so freakin good and b) this place is open very rarely.
Like I dunno why they are closed so often..sometimes they are closed for like 2 months (last summer), there was a note against the glass saying they will be closed for the next two months and then very often when I'm in the city I have found them to be closed..u have to really be lucky to find them open.
I have tried their lotus sweet with black bean stuffing and like it too. Also tried but didn't like their sesame fried sweet ball!
I have wanted to buy their pineapple bread after I got a couple of recommendations but they were out of it when I wanted them.< /review>

You are taking a chance when you come here because they don't post anything about vacation time. They close as they please with no notice until you show up. That's my warning to anyone that is local or tourist, it doesn't matter, no special privilege of any here. Why this shop is so popular is because advertisement in SF brochure or magazine, the stuff you pick up at your hotel lobby. Back in the days it was .55¢ per egg tart. Now it's nearly two bucks each. Those that don't know any better will line up just to get a shot at them saying I've been there blah blah blah. Egg tart isn't hard to make at all and no difference from other bakery. You come because you want your friends back home to see that you stop by and had egg tart. There are other things that I see and know about this place being a local living 30+ years. However, I won't say just find out yourself.<//review>

They have the best egg tart in SF. The line is always long, but my husband is a huge fan! So he waits in the line for more than 45 minutes.

Moon cakes are pretty awesome too. Be aware of the long wait though! They close for vacations all the time. Call first.< /Text>

Egg tarts are hot. Way better than Eastern bakery, but not quite worth the hype or line.

Cash only, if you want black bean moon cakes get there earlier.<//text>

<Review>Are they finally open? Is there a crazy line? If you aren’t a local then you’ll have to get lucky to find this popular bakery open and not swarmed with customers.

Why the hype? This bakery has the best egg tarts in Chinatown, but the owners leave on trips whenever they feel like it. Their notices are simply a paper note stuck on their door with no online announcements.

The egg tarts are simply delicious with a flakey crust and buttery filling.

So try to get one if you’re in town (hopefully the owners are too) and pray there isn’t a long line.<//Review>< pics>

I went in again and yes I am now double addicted! The staff thinks I am as well. I got the red velvet cupcake and the cinnamon buns and they were better than the last times I had them. This is a great staff! I will try something else when I go next time, but keep up the great work Golden Gate.<//text>

Pleasantly surprised with the egg tart. I didn't think I would enjoy it, but it was very tasty! It probably helped that we got one fresh out of the oven. The line was long, but moved quickly. Cash only which stinks for us because we didn't have a lot, otherwise we would have gotten more items.<//text>

The egg tart is very very good.  So good that if you're not ordering some, the seller would give you a weird look since the line is so long.  Oh.. they can go on extended vacation leaving the shop closed too.<//Text>

<Review>I finally was able to visit this bakery on my third try. The first two times I tried, they happened to be closed for vacation! I was on vacation too, trying to go there! Anyway, the line may be long but it's worth the wait. Delicious egg custard tarts, fresh and hot from the oven,  Don't try to take pictures inside because that's not allowed!</Review><resp>None</resp></record>

Tip: Believe the praise.  These are the best egg tarts in all of Chinatown and probably beyond.  There is no seating, the hours are unpredictable (they close all the time, probably because they are doing so well) but if you're lucky enough to order some, consider yourself lucky and bring cash as it's cash only.< /text>

The custard tarts here are to die for! No other place even comes close. The only downside to this place is that the location is always difficult to drive in and parking is horrendous. If you're local and/or don't mind taking the bus, this place is great.

For me, I HAVE to eat these custard tarts on the spot. I don't like them after they have cooled down. So, I usually only just buy one or two. My other friends typically buy a dozen or so. The prices are slightly more expensive from what I remember as well. About $2/each.

And there is usually a line. So be prepared to not only struggle to find parking, but to wait for your yummy tarts.</text>

Egg tarts ($2) for days! Little whole in the wall of china town and usually there's at least an hour wait but i got lucky on a weekday and really had no wait. They sell out really quickly and their store is very old. Hours are not consistent and leave for "vacation" very often. Tarts were soft and very pudding like when warm. Not a crazy fan of tarts so i thought they were ok.</text>

<Text>So I have mixed feelings about Golden Gate Bakery and their Egg Custard Tarts. I think I just have too high expectations of the place. Everyone talks about it and I had it, it was really good. The pastry was crispy and the custard was perfectly done, tender not too runny and yet not too bouncy like gelatin texture either. Eat the tart when it comes out of the oven, I was lucky to get that, it's the perfect temperature and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I tried their other stuff like banana cake etc, they were decent, not spectacular but pretty good.

However, what I don't like about it, which I can't really put my hands on it but the flavor is different to what a traditional Hong Kong egg custard tart should taste. I can't explain it, it's just different. They're both very good but I think I just had an expectation that it would be more traditional.< /Text>< Pics>

I'd give this place five stars if it weren't so fickle about when it's open or closed. There are days when it closes early for no reason. There are days or weeks when it's closed for vacation but with no sign as to when it will be open again. And for 蛋撻 dan tat (Chinese egg tart), it's pricy. BUT it's so worth it. These are hands-down the best 蛋撻 in SF, if not the Bay Area. My friends did a 蛋撻 crawl through Chinatown one afternoon just to compare the most popular places, and Golden Gate Bakery is peerless. There's a reason why there's always such a long line.</Review>

<Text>Must eat!!! Best custard tarts I've ever had. Warm and right out of the oven. So fresh! It's a little hole in the wall place with no seating. So expect to grab, go and devour! I almost went back for a second tart, but was pressed for time.< /Text>< Name>

<review>Quite an unique egg tart. It's probably the lard. Anyway, constantly closed for any reason they can think of. Though maybe not really closed because  there are some hidden transactions of pink paper boxes with what I can only assume to be egg tarts to some secret society or just their pals. Expect a line and slow service if they are open. I don't even bother anymore and I've found a new go to place. I only eat these egg tarts when my friends buy them and share, which is often enough for me. Too much trouble to get them.<//review><UserId.>106741691368573657663<//UserId.>< Name>

Lives up to the reputation of best egg custard tarts in SF, and possible the world! If ever in the area, always be sure to stop in to grab some goodies. The line may seem daunting but it moves quickly and the line is justified. Beware they have random unusually long vacations so you could possibly make the trip all the way to Chinatown only to find scribbled Chinese on a piece of paper telling you they're closed for who knows how long.< /Text>

This place will not disappoint you - the best egg custard tarts I've ever had. The wait is ALWAYS long...be prepared to wait 30min-1hr. But once you get a taste of those fresh, piping hot, flaky egg custards, you'll be blinded by the deliciousness and will forget all about that long wait in the middle of Chinatown.<//text>

Best 'Dan Tat's in the entire city. Lines can be really long, but its worth the wait.

Yes, the egg tarts are a bit more expensive then the rest of the ones in the area or in the city, but its fresh right out of the oven when you buy it there. You can't go wrong with fresh.< /text>

CHINESE EGG TARTS are underrated here. It's huge and flavorful and will taste delish fresh or cold. You cannot go wrong in this bakery.

Don't be fooled by the look of the location. It doesn't seem like much baking happens here because of the lack of kitchen (from the outsiders point of view)  but deliciousness is sure made here someway, somehow. I have no idea but I am floored by the quality of the egg tarts here, which are their most popular item.

Be warned of a long line. There always seems to be one.</review>

Those little custard tarts are phenomenal. If you go during the weekend, there will be a line 20 people deep. But if you can go during the week during off hours, there may be only 1 or 2 people in line ahead of you.< /Review>

<Text>We, like many other, visited this place out of curiosity looking at the long lines outside. We have tried some really good Chinese bakeries back in Boston and compared to that this one is okay. Coconut macaroons were the best.

Was here October 24. For one reason or another the ladies in the counter kept saying the egg tarts will be ready in 1 hour or 45 minutes. So when we came back after 45, there were no tarts. It will be ready in another 45 minutes. Why didn’t they tell us to just wait in line for the tarts? This is a big disappointment because people used to wait in line for these tarts and hundreds of them come out as they are baked.<//Text>

<Review>My favorite Egg Tart place in San Francisco. However, expect long lines from tourists and foodies who love their Dan Tats (egg tart). I still wait in line though, because of the tasty flaky crust and the warm sweetened egg custard. This review is just for the egg tart. I don't buy the other pastries at the bakery. I would probably just go to a less crowded one if I needed them.<//Review>< response>

They have the best Dan Tat in SF. There is always a long line there. Least you know it is fresh then. The line moves relatively fast though. The workers work hard to speed up the proccess. Definitely worth the wait.< /Text>

This place is known for their egg tarts, people will stand in line waiting for them to come out of the oven.  The lines can be long and people will order boxes of these egg tarts.  The down side, they are very pricey compared to the other shops.  Yes the other shops may not be as good, but you won't have to wait in line.  They also have the standard BBQ pork buns and other sweets, but everyone comes here for the egg tar.  If you pick up a box and it's still very warm, make sure you leave a gap on the lid so the warm air can get out or you'll end up with soggy egg tarts and no one wants that.< /Review>

This bakery has the strangest operating hours ever. It doesn't matter because their egg tarts are so good that you'll be at their mercy anyway! The best you can do is to give them a call before going. At $2.25 for one egg tart and $27 for a dozen, I'd say prices are pretty fair given the quality and taste. One piece of helpful advice, rather than to struggle to find parking in SF's notoriously crowded small streets, have one person get dropped off to wait in line. It's pretty typical to see a long line in front of the bakery. I remember circling the block a few times and double parking on numerous occasions (with emergency lights on) while waiting for my friend to obtain the prized goods.< /Text>

There's always some long line coming out of Grant Street, and it's probably from Golden Gate!
Their moon cakes are amazingly delicious, but their egg custard tarts are OUTSTANDING! The egg custard is nice and smooth, while the tart is fresh, hot and flaky.
Unfortunately, this bakery is often closed for vacation, whether it's Chinese New Year, Christmas, or some random time in the middle of the month..< /text>

<review>Best chocolate cookie I've ever eaten FULL STOP!  Golden Gate lives up to the hype. Fresh from the oven the double dark chocolate cookie was an out of control bite of heaven.  I'm not sure calling it something so simple as a cookie is even on target. It's so much more than that. And the chocolate walnut cookie was divine as well. If you're close by, it's a must stop. The line is worth the wait, promise!!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>The egg tarts here are great but kind of getting really pricey. 1.95/each? And no one ever just buys one. And because people buy a lot, there could be a short wait while more come out. The line outside gets pretty ridiculous as well (if you are lucky enough to catch them when they are actually open). They have other things as well besides egg tarts, but meh.<//review>< user>

The ladies here open up whenever they feel like it. We stopped by around noon to find a closed shop, came back around 7 PM to find a 40 minute line. Really great egg tarts though.<//Review>

I don't understand the appeal of this place.  People rave about the egg custard tarts but I really wasn't a fan.  I was expecting more of a custard flavor, but instead it's got a sweet, VERY strong egg flavor, which just seemed out of place in a dessert.  In addition, there's often an hour plus wait for them.  I know people love this place, but I'm not a fan.  Make sure you like egg custard before braving the long lines here.< /text>

People hate the long line and unpredictable business hours. But there is a reason that the they open for business as they please - what they sell is so good. We wait in line for about 30 minutes, which is not bad and the line gets longer after us. To make the waiting worth, we had three egg tarts, three mini Niangao, and a big sesame ball. The service is very good. The lady behind the counter is very friendly and happy to help out with my selection. Come here for a local experience and gain boasting right.< /Text>

I've had egg tarts from a few Chinese places. These are the best. The custard still tastes like egg rather than cream.

The ladies behind the counter are brusque and speak little English, as it should be.

IT'S SO CHEAP!<//text>

A long line snaking out of the shop. Craning necks, eager eyes, drooling mouths. Feet getting sore. Where are the egg tarts. Are they really that good? Nah. You should skip the line and try another bakery.<//text>

<Text>This is a great place to get EGG TARTS!!! Price is horrible though. I get one egg tart for 1.85 a piece at this location but it's worth the wait and to die for. I always come get egg tarts at this location. I get as many as a dozen per visit. Line is always out the door and around down to the next shop on the weekends. Definitely a place to visit when you are in the city for some Asian Pastries!!=D< /Text><Rating>4< /Rating>< Time>

<text>There was a line that wrapped back and forth on the sidewalk in front of this bakery when we visited there during the Chinese New Year celebration. The place itself is not much to look at, and kind of a mess inside. It is cash only, so come prepared.

The pastries were very good. We tried a number of different things, I had the egg tart and a mini apple pie thing. The egg tart was excellent, and the mini apple pie was also excellent. Writing this now is making me want to go back and get more.< /text><UserId.>110693175237378228684<//UserId.><Time>1456592812783</Time>< rate>

Food is good but have absolutely no customer skills. People in front of us ordered 3 dozens and we only wanted 6. They were short for 10 and instead of giving us 6 so we can leave we waited for 10 mins for the new tarts.</review>

Hard to find this bakery open. When they are, they sell very expensive Moon Pies and other pastries. Always a long line to get anything and they will start to ration if supplies are low. Food was good though not worth how much I paid for it.</Text>

<pics>None</pics><Text>Their opening hours change daily depending on the wind.  Long lines make getting anything very frustrating.  Usually 4-5 starts if you're lucky enough to get to the front of the line.  3 stars or less if you wait so long that you had to skip out and go home.  Otherwise I heard the egg tarts are amazing.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Let me recommend something other than their egg tarts (which are good): their coconut macaroons. Nice and toasted on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, and in fact, better eating when left out for a day or two.<//Review>

<Text>So overrated!  When you are in line or walking by, there are locals.  Skip the wait and just go to Napoleon on Stockton.  The egg tarts there are just as good and half the price.  They are busy too, but no one published them in a magazine yet.  That's where the locals buy the egg tarts.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

If you grew up in the city like I did, then you already know this is one of the many spots to get good dan tat. Each custard cost $1.75 each and they only accept cash so don't come in here thinking they run square or shopify to support tech companies. This place is the original.< /Text>

<Review>Probably the best place for egg custard.  The long wait in line is worth it since the egg custard is fresh from the oven.  Try to eat them when there warm since this the best way to eat them.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>The egg tarts are a must get!!! Whenever I'm in the city, I try to make a trip to Chinatown just to get these addicting desserts. The shop is like most shops in Chinatown with an unattractive exterior to match its interior. There is only a small cramped space in front of the counter for you to place your order. The egg tarts are now $1.50 each (Cash only), which is a pricey. However, considering how I've very had egg tarts this delicious, the price is justified. The egg tarts are larger than your average egg tart and are always hot and fresh when I have ordered them. People say that there's always a long wait, but I've never experienced this since I probably come during off times. On the downside, Golden Gate Bakery often closes randomly for no reason, so I would suggest calling ahead of time to see if they are open.<//Text><rating>4<//rating><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None< /pics><Gmap_id>0x808580f49eea8c29:0xed441d49b092b257< /Gmap_id>< user>

Although the owners opened the bakery not for their wealth but for their health (they are on vacation from time to time), their egg tart is definitely a must-eat in SF. Especially, when it came right out of the oven, the custard is so tender that can just slip right through your tounge. And the layered crust (unlike usual pie crust) is the best to hold the custard filling and yet does not take away the custard texture, so you can enjoy it till the last bite!< /Text>

The BEST dan tats in the bay, for sure! (: There's usually a long line and sometimes they're closed unexpectedly, but when they are open be sure to stop by. If you're only getting one or two items, the employees always tell me that I shouldn't wait in line and skip to the front. But, normally I always buy at least half a dozen!<//Review>

Dropped by here around 12:30pm for some egg tarts after hitting up Good Mong Kok Bakery. Grabbed two tarts ($1.40 each). Only 2 people in line, so no wait.

The egg tarts were really good and probably the best I've had. Consistency was excellent, and a bit sweeter than typical ones I've had.<//review><Rate>4<//Rate></record>

This place way exceeded my expectations. With alllll the hype, I was pretty skeptical but now I see. I actually burned the inside of my mouth eating that egg tart, but I don't even care. If I could give 7 stars, I'd give that egg tart 7 stars out of 5.

I also got a wintermelon pastry to see if this place is just good for egg tarts. I bought it, didn't eat it (was too overwhelmed by egg tart), put it in the fridge, and took a bite the next morning. It was....amazing. The best wintermelon pastry I've had and I've had a lot of them. And this wasn't even fresh, and I was too lazy to microwave it so it was COLD. And it still tasted like heaven. There were wintermelon bits and almond bits in the filling that gave a really nice and fun texture. It was just perfect.
[EDIT] I microwaved the rest and it tasted even more amazing if that's even possible.

If I could create magical pastries like these, I'd take 5-6 months off every year too.</review>

<text>We came here with our friends on a Sat night. After knowing they don't take reservation and usually have a line, we came right before 5PM. Luckily, that turned out to be perfect timing. We only waited about 5 minutes before being seated. Strangely, a lot of people were already eating and I was not sure if they were eating dinner or a late lunch?

At any rate, we had buffet dinner at $24 a person. A child over 4 is charged like half of the price. They have an interesting rule of ordering no more than 4 meat at the same time. You can, however, order other dishes as often as you like including tofu soup, fried chicken, etc. Their beverage prices are quite reasonable too although I didn't waste my appetite on drinks. My favorite is their kalbi, bulgogi and beef tip. They have free bonchons (kimchi, potato salad, etc.) but no typical Korean steamed eggs or seafood pancake. I personally think that is a miss.

One thing to note and perhaps to improve is their fan system for seats by the windows. Essentially, there is no fan so those seats get a lot of smoke and that means your clothes will smell like Korean BBQ :)

Last but not the least is their customer service is very good and friendly. I actually lost my sunglasses at the seat because my son was going through my bag. Fortunately, I left them a message on FB and the manager was able to find it for me. Will be back for this place!<//text>< Pictures>

The best egg tarts anywhere, including possibly many places you will find in Hong Kong. The ladies behind the counter are pretty rude but that's just part of the deal. You don't eat their attitude, just the dreamy egg tarts.<//Review>

I love their egg tarts but they seem to always be on vacation! I'm not sure why. The egg tarts are super delicious and uber flakey! I can't wait to go back when they are finally open to buy some more!

If you happen to stop by and they are actually open, be prepared to wait in a line because people flock to Chinatown to have this awesome dessert.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<date>1383203869917<//date><Text>4 stars for the egg tarts here but after trying the over-priced moon cakes here, I had to give it just 3 stars.

Honestly, I don’t even know why I stood in that dreadful line at Golden Gate bakery because I absolutely hated moon cakes as a child and have stayed away from them ever since. The line was only exacerbated by the fact that Mid-Autumn Festival was coming up that weekend, and China Town was overflowing with festivities. For those not privy to Chinese holidays, Mid-Autumn Festival is a big deal. Back home in Taiwan, my parents, my little sister, and our whole extended family spend a whole weekend BBQing, eating moon cakes, peeling pomelos, and moon gazing together. Gifting beautifully designed boxes of moon cakes to friends and family was common, stealthily re-gifting these boxes was also not uncommon.

Out of nostalgia, I decided to give moon cakes another try. The fact that I just happened to be a few blocks away from the ever-so-popular Golden Gate Bakery that day gave me another reason to swing by.

I tried the taro, the white lotus seed, and the coconut mixed nuts moon cakes, the last being my favorite flavor out of all three. Let’s just say that the moon cakes from Golden Gate Bakery were good for what they were (I still don’t have a taste for moon cakes in general), but definitely not worth standing in line for over an hour for.</Text>< GmapID>

<Gmap_id>0x808580f49eea8c29:0xed441d49b092b257<//Gmap_id><text>over hyped egg tarts... Then again, lining up is a thing to do here in SF, it's not good unless you have to wait for it.

the crust is pressed too hard and not flaky
the insides is on point if your eat it right then and there. If you take it home it gets cold, if you heat it up it hardens and separates from the crust. Its not horrible, but it's not worth 1 hour wait.

I don't get why people line up to buy boxes and boxes of them because if you heat up any other decent egg tart and this one later on in the oven, the texture won't be too much of a difference.

If i pass by and theres no line, I'll grab a few to eat while walking. I would never buy a box togo to heat up in the oven later.< /text><Date>1473968696095<//Date>< pictures>

The egg tart is out of this world;  be ready top stand in long lines and sometimes they atre not open during their own set opening hours so I would suggest to always call ahead top confirm they ate open.   It is worth all the trouble to get it.< /Text>

Cute famouse spot in china town. Only dissapointment when i got there was that there werent much of any options ready for sell. But thats okay becaus what they did have was delicious. They may be famouse for their original egg tarts but i looooved their coconut egg tart pastries. It was way better in my opinion and i miss them ❤. Will definitely be back for more when im back in town<//Review>

Local tiny mom and pop bakery shop located in Chinatown serving up what people call the best "dan tat" or egg custard tarts around town. It has definitely become a tourist attraction but you'll find some locals here as well. I will say the egg tarts were pretty darn good one or two years ago but I've noticed either the recipe or baker has changed since the crust is not as flaky and buttery as before. It's a bit overpriced at over $1 per egg tart but is still a great snack for those who have never tried one before.

Be prepared for long lines and bundle up since the wait can be up to an hour long at times. There aren't any tables available to sit and eat at either. Workers here aren't the friendliest and they don't speak much English so if all fails just point to what you want through the glass case.<//Text>

We read a lot of good reviews about the egg tarte so we had to try one. To our luck they were just right out of the oven. We also had a lotus moon cake and some kind of a mochi like cake.

Unfortunately, the egg tarte wasn't to our taste. It is exactly like it sounds like, egg in a crust. I guess were were expecting something a little less eggy and more sweet (tart-y). But that's only my hubby and I opinion.

The mochi thingy was blend not much flavor... As for the moon cake it was really good !<//text>< Pics>

<userid>100249539677162904250< /userid><text>I guess Golden Gate Bakery doesn't really need my help in recommending them, but I have to say that their egg tarts are really good. You MUST eat them fresh to enjoy their flaky, eggy goodness. Otherwise, they get exponentially worse with every minute you wait to eat them.

That said, a fresh GGB egg tart has a delicate, flaky crust. Each layer is really thin and provides a very enjoyable light crisp as your teeth sink into it. The custard is smooth with a semi-gelatinous jiggly texture, and its flavor is pleasantly eggy and sweet but not overtly buttery or rich.  I like that it's not too rich, buttery, or heavy as the crust's relative lightness compliments the sweet egg custard perfectly! These delectable treats are the only reasons you need to take a trip to Chinatown. Yes, reasons, because you won't just eat one.

I also want to add that I only find these lighter, sweeter egg tarts around here. Whenever I've been to Hong Kong or Macau, they tend to be richer and heavier but still very delicious. If you want to try an egg tart that resembles that kind of style, order the Portuguese Tarts (Po Tat) from Koi Palace. They have a thicker, richer crust while the egg custard is more buttery and heavier. They're much more decadent if that's your thing. I can't get enough of either!</text>< user_name>

My favorite mooncake flavor is winter melon. Not too sweet. There is a lot of macadamia in it. You can order mooncakes with 1/2/3/4 yolks. I don't like yolks that much, so I had plain one. I must have spend over 40 bucks on their mooncakes this year.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I had Golden Gate Bakery in my bookmarks for a very long time but I'm from Miami and didn't know when I'd be back in San Francisco, CA so we could finally meet.I'm a fan of cookies but was skeptical about how great these could actually be, because hello they are just cookies.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It's delicious. If you stop by Chinatown, it's worth a try. I'm not interested in Chinatown, but I don't think you need to go there for this! You can stop by while visiting the pyramid building, bookstore, and Chinatown!

맛있어요 차이나타운 들린다면 먹어볼만합니다. 차이나타운 관심 없는데 굳이 이것땜에 가실필요는 없을 것 같아요! 피라미드 빌딩이랑 서점 구경하고, 차이나타운도 구경하면서 들릴 정도!</Text>

(Translated by Google) It's a shop I go to every time I go to San Francisco. Custard tart (egg tart) seems to be the most popular, and you can enjoy freshly baked warm egg tarts whenever you go. It seems that it may be sold out on Saturdays and Sundays, so it is recommended to visit early.

(Original)
サンフランシスコに行くたびに通ってしまうお店です。カスタードタルト（エッグタルト）は一番人気のようで、いつ行っても焼き立ての温かいエッグタルトを楽しむことができます。土日は売り切れることもあるようなので、早めに訪れることをお勧めします。< /Text>

(Translated by Google) For the crowd of egg towers, it feels normal, and the rice cakes are full, in a word, the traditional and smooth taste

(Translated by Google) Delicious! You do not need to try a cheaper alternative, that can not be done on this bakery. I deduct one star at a unit price of $ 2.75. You should try it anyway. Highly recommended 👍🏼

Sehr lecker! Man brauch gar keine günstigere Alternative ausprobieren, das kommt an diese Bäckerei nicht ran. Ich ziehen ein Stern ab bei einem Stückpreis von 2,75$. Man sollte es dennoch einmal probieren. Sehr empfehlenswert 👍🏼< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It's definitely different from the egg tart you usually ate. It's less sweet, more savory and um ... very affordable.

<gmap_id>0x808580f49eea8c29:0xed441d49b092b257<//gmap_id><Review>(Translated by Google) I haven't eaten a lot of egg tarts, so I can't compare them, but the taste is not bad. The tart dough was thin and crispy, and the eggs were soft and moderately sweet. However, the smell of eggs was not good.

(Original)
에그타르트를 많이 먹어본 편은 아니라서 비교는 못 하겠지만, 나쁘진 않은 맛. 타르트 반죽이 얇고 바삭한 것이 좋았고 계란은 부드럽고 적당히 달았음. 다만 계란 비린내가 나는게 별로였음.<//Review><userid>111562645089494624229< /userid>< response>
