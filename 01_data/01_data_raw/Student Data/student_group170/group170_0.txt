I finally cut my cable and am very pleased I did it. I was an Xfinity customer for 10 years, which was so much more expensive for less service. My neighbor kept recommending Starry. It was so easy to make the switch and Starry deserves all the credit. Victor Tam was my Starry Installation Technician. He was professional, courteous, fast, as well as, ready to answer my questions. It took less than an hour. Victor was great. I am a happy customer.< /review>

<date>1615830315290<//date><rate>4</rate><Review>Overall, the service is very good and affordable.
The reason it's only 4 stars is because it can be highly unreliable during rain and high winds.
I've had to contact support 5 times during the 2 and a half months I've had this service. Their customer support is VERY GOOD. They are quick and responsive. However, I would rather not have to message them every other week to get my internet to work.

Still, it's WAY better than AT&T, but they need to do something to improve their reliability because it's starting to get annoying.
I like that there is no cap on data usage and there doesn't seem to be any noticeable throttling like other main ISPs do.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Amazing internet service if you just want internet. Simple, fast, high quality, and amazing communication/response team (they respond to emails/chats VERY quick on the app and via email!). Highly recommend if you just want that high-quality, fast internet without the bundle charge-up and confusion from other providers.</Text>

Not only did they liberate my home from the bad service of Spectrum, the location of their router turned out to be more convenient, their app is easy to use, and the one time I had a question about the service they immediately got back to me.

<Review>I don't write reviews. But I adore starry, I tell all my friends if it is available to get it. I have only had an outage once and they took care of it quickly. I love that I can control my internet from an app. Also because I was the first to sign up in my building I got a hand delivered gift basket. So now I have some solid starry socks and sunglasses and I love them. Thanks starry!!!< /Review>< pics>

Starry is great!!! They are super responsive and proactive. The was one time where I was notified via the handy starry app that there was a potential outage in my building. The internet didn’t go out, but I really appreciate they gave me the heads up so I could save what I was doing and plan to move locations to finish work. Love the look of the router and that I can control everything from my phone. AND the speeds they offer at only $50 a month can’t be beat. I’m moving in a couple weeks and devastated I can’t use starry at my new building. Hoping they expand soon! 🤞🏻<//Review>

I really enjoy Starry internet service. You absolutely cannot beat the price! If we ever have issues with our internet going out, I usually receive an email letting me know they are working to fix the problem before I can even call it in. Very quick. There are a couple "Dead zones" in the apartment but they are very tiny areas. Like I said, cannot beat the price/value!< /review>

The service is fast and a very great price for the excellent service you get while on the internet and the great customer service support staff that is very helpful and knowledgeable about just about anything you might have a problem or questions about. IF ANYONE OUT THERE IS LOOKING FOR NEW OR A CHANCE OF INTERNET SERVICE, STARRY IS THE ONE YOU NEED. (SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?) PICK UP YOUR PHONE AND CALL THEM. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPONTED.

I love, love, love this service! When they became available in my building I immediately signed up to get away from Spectrum. $50/month forever? With more then twice the speed I was getting? YES PLEASE.

I set up my installation day, and they came right on time. The only reason the installation lasted so long is because my previous provider made a mess of all the old wires.

What I love most about this service is the touch pad router they give you. Super modern, slick, and cute. You can do everything from that thing which makes is extremely convenient. I like convenience.

I would recommend them to everyone.< /Text>

I've been with Starry for about 3 months now and it's such a blessing because my last internet service provider was extremely overpriced and they were always raising the prices. Starry is fast enough for streaming, works great with gaming and any other everyday tasks. I've played Overwatch and League, ran PS4 downloads, and used Nintendo Switch online play with no issues. It also works smoothly with my iPad and phone when I want to save on data costs. Definitely recommend Starry to anyone looking for a good deal on an internet plan!</text>

< review>
I've been with starry for about +2 years (I think) in the beginning there were hiccups, once I submitted a complaint throughout their app I had a reply that same day scheduling an appointment for one of their technicians to come over and fix the problem.
I had att before this was paying $55-60 for 24mb and I needed a landline so there were other costs involved. With start it's $50 all the way for 200 and often 300mb. That's nuts!!!
I recommend you to get it if they have it in your building.< /review>

I'm a video content professional working from home, so having dependable & fast internet is essential and the backbone of my livelihood.

As soon as I found out about Starry, did some research and saw that their customer service was absolutely second to none and their pricing was unbeatable.

Decided to sign-up that same day. Service tech was very nice and respectful, had me up and running in less than an hour.

Their router is super space-age, and you can request to have a customer service technician call you right on the vibrant & colorful touch screen.

Starry is the Internet Service Provider we need in our lives. Highly recommend.< /text>

Starry is one of the best value for speed ISP in Los Angeles. Customer service is top notch: quick, direct, and efficient. Download and Upload speeds are consistently over 200 Mbps each. The only thing I would wish they improved on is their router which is a bit faulty at times. I would highly recommend Starry if it’s an option in your area.<//Review>

<Review>Excellent experience so far! I was able to set up an installation within 24 hours and during the weekend, something other internet providers were not able to provide. The technician was friendly, on time, and walked me through any questions I had. Best of all, the customer service has been incredible. Anytime I had a question or needed to troubleshoot something, I have been able to talk to a representative within 2 minutes of calling. Overall, I appreciate the excellent customer service and hassle free set up. Great job Starry!< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Be aware of possible damages to your property caused by Starry. A few Starry technicians installed the internet in our apartment building and they damaged my car while working in the garage.

Unfortunately they didn’t ask the leasing office to move my car; nobody was aware of this situation. They drilled holes in the concrete ceiling, pulled cables and worked with equipment around/above my car. Rocks and drills fell all over my car and it was a mess as my car was completely covered by debris. In addition, they didn’t clean up after themselves…

A Starry technician told me somebody would call me the next day to resolve the issue but nobody called at all! I’ve made several attempts over the past few weeks to obtain their liability insurance information, however they did not provide it. No attempts on their side. They kept saying somebody would contact me.

As their field office failed to comply with the state law, I contacted their headquarters in Boston. A customer representative assured me that a manager would call me immediately to resolve this issue. So far no phone calls. I found this as an unfair practice.

Do I really want to subscribe to their internet services, have them come over to my apartment and maybe cause more damages? I’ll probably cancel an upcoming appointment with them and not use their internet services.

This is a nightmare and disappointment. It’s time consuming as I will probably have to file a lawsuit. One star rating for being ignored by Starry after the company damaged my car and didn't fix it. Shame on you, Starry!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I'm going to hate reviewing this because everyone will know the secret to hassle free, fast, reliable internet. I've only used Spectrum forever which is a damn shame. Overpriced, slow and don't get me started on customer service. I had major reservations about signing up with them. I didn't understand the technology and what the catches were. I'm so happy that I went with them, I was able to chat with some of their reps in person which was so helpful in making decisions. Don't even question. Know this company is solid and they have REAL PEOPLE who know what the hell is going on! GO! DO IT!<//Review>

I was apprehensive, but the people at Starry are all amazing - what a refreshing change !  The service has been very reliable and there has never been a time when it was offline. It is a lot faster than the Spectrum service I had. Spectrum speed was 115 Mbps Download and 12 Mbps Upload. Starry is about 360 Mbps Download and 400 Mbps upload. Yes !< /text>

<text>Starry is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stuffy internet service world.
I'm loving the service, the price is right & the company has been very hands on in their approach. In the past I have felt trapped in bundle deals with no other choice but to pay for services I didn't need at a premium price. I'm happy a new vibrant company is taking over the market!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Quick and easy setup, comes with an app where you can message a support member and they responded within minutes. The app also lets you see what devices are connected. Flat rate with no hidden fees and quick/reliable internet! A great alternative to bigger companies; they didn't try to nickel and dime me into buying a more expensive package that I didn't need.</review>

Simply the best. for $50 a month you get internet speeds upwards of 80Mbps!. Whats more is their customer service and service plans. No awkward promotions, no clueless contractors but just a smooth completely online customer support system. This truly is internet for the 21st century. Thank you Starry.< /text>

Everyone I have dealt with is extremely courteous and friendly and everything has worked exactly as promised. Since I have only been a customer for approximately two months (with absolutely NO problems, I might add), I will be updating this in the future; but I must say that if you are tired of the high prices and nonsense of "bundling" to get a decent price on your internet service I would highly recommend that you check out Starry.< /Text>< pictures>

We switched to Starry from Spectrum. Honestly the sexy looking router and two speeds of internet is what sold me.</text>

It’s the best internet service so far and I’ve  tried them all. Not only they let you try it out for a month free and if you don’t like it you can cancel anytime so you got nothing to lose...
This is a no brainer... !!< /text>

I look forward to only paying $50 a month. I guess the last straw with spectrum was when I over paid my bill by five dollars and they made up a charge called other rather than putting it towards my next month. I’m sure I’ll save a few thousand trees because I won’t get all of this junk mail that tends to not know what services I already have as well as The fact that my bill is due on the 17th if that really not until the 26th but I just received a phone call just now reminding me I’m sure I’ll get 5000 more times before the end of the week</Text>

I originally had a service with Spectrum from $45 @ 100mps. At first, I thought this was an excellent deal, until I found out that this price was for a 12 month period only. After finding out that the price of my internet would increase, I became very interested in Starry's internet service. They offer a 200mps @$50/month. Since I live really close to the antenna, which is how the connection occurs, I get anywhere from 250-350mps. At this insane speed and only for $50, why would I ever go back to spectrum? If your location is eligible for this internet service provider, please do change. You wont regret their customer service, tech support, and awesome incentives.< /Text>

<Name>Jennifer Bishop<//Name><gmap_id>0x80d959d2a848b841:0xdb82b9c01102d08a<//gmap_id><text>I’m conflicted with this review because we were paired with a great dog.  He’s amazing.  He was not the dog we selected but picked out for us in a line of alternatives.  Needless to say, it was love at first site.  We adopted and wouldn’t have our pup without Barking Lot.  The staff was fine and the well fair check of our home okay.  It did turn out our new family member wasn't good with cats but we were able to train him easily not to chase them.

The only issues Ive had is that we weren’t allowed inside, which seemed strange and despite having had a fresh bath, he was full of hair matts.  He was there for 4 months.  They also told us he was “food aggressive” — which is not the case.  They must not have been feeding him enough.  This is a dog who quickly and easily shares his food with our cats and other dogs, no issue.

Everyone was nice and responsive but in my opinion, they should open it up to the public so that you can easily see the dogs are clean, well cared for and not cramped into small cages.<//text>< pics>

MUST READ to PROTECT YOURSELF from STACY PALMER-PAY W/ CREDIT CARD. DON"T PAY W/ DEBIT CARD or CASH. Google Stacy Palmer/Elysa to read full review or see YELP. As a animal lover I am really conflicted on publishing this review, because its the poor dogs under her care that will ultimately suffer. I have no doubt dogs remain in her care for much longer than necessary because of 60+ negative reviews. I feel it necessary to inform the public after multiple unscrupulous interactions with Stacy. Read her reviews because she could repossess your best friend years later. I don’t want to discourage saving a dog from her deplorable conditions. IF YOUR PURCHASE GOES BAD USING A CREDIT CARD WILL HELP YOU HAVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME IN YOUR FAVOR. She has a sad 3.2 rating and believe it would be much lower but many pity the dogs and don’t post negative reviews. I am filing a court case against Stacy. Please contact me if you were forced to purchase or rent a GPS collar, forced to purchase a regular collar or leash, did not receive a refund on your GPS collar, unclear if you purchased your dog or paid a fee described as a donation, or boarded your dog.
When we purchased our first dog Ruby we rented a GPS collar which stopped working after the first week. Stacy demands a working GPS worn for 2 months and can repossess if not worn. We got Ruby because the previous owner did not have the GPS on her and Stacy repossessed her. I contacted Stacy immediately and she failed to supply a new collar which was not working because the bill was not paid. It then took 5 months to get a refund. I suspect the refund came thru because I told her I would be filing a credit card dispute.  We also boarded Ruby for 2 days. We went to pick her up and Stacy had her at a different location. We waited for 2.5 hours to meet Stacy at a Starbucks to get her back and the time had lapsed into 3 days. Stacy attempted to charge me for 3 days and I refused to pay extra. I had a uneasy feeling as if she thought of keeping her if I did not pay the extra. Looking back and having read many reviews I now realize Stacy could have decided to repossess our dog if she saw fit. She is a control freak and extremely defensive on everything.
A month ago we purchased Elysa. Stacy received Elysa 2 days prior from Thailand and did not have time to do a proper evaluation. Elysa was very jealous of Ruby and constantly fought her. Ruby is extremely passive, much larger and was terrified to be in the same house. After 5 days we had to make the heartbreaking decision to return her. We had bonded with her and a month later its still painful to think of her in Stacys deplorable 100+ degree kennels. If Elysa was our only dog we would have kept her as she was very sweet. We paid $400 cash (CRITICAL MISTAKE) for Elysa and Stacy made me purchase a USED GPS collar for $100. Upon returning her I kept the GPS collar to use on the next dog we get from Stacy. I was very emotional and forgot to remove the receipt when returning all Elysa’s critical paperwork. I have requested 5 times a copy of my receipt/contract, to choose another dog, or a refund with NO response. She disabled the GPS collar. What type of despicable person resells (double dips) a dog, refuses to give a refund, accepts no responsibility for properly evaluating a dog, or provide a receipt. If she treats you like this STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND TAKE HER TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT!
I am in the process of filing a small claims suit against Stacy and look forward to hearing her answers in court. As a expert in her field she was negligent in properly evaluating Elysa whom needs a home with no other pets.  I WILL NOT ALLOW STACY PALMER TO IMPOSE HER LAW ON ME AND WILL FORCE HER TO ANSWER BEFORE A JUDGE IN A COURT OF LAW. I have all the paperwork from our first purchase with specific amounts in which she sells and rents items and believe she is not following the State of California’s business requirements and is misclassifying purchases as donations. Please contact me if you have any pertinent info.</text>

<review>We tried to adopt somewhere else, but keep coming back to the Barking Lot. They let dogs be dogs. We just adopted the second dog after we had to put down one we adopted in 2016. Both times we were able to spend time with the dog, let them hang out with our dog, see them with other dogs and we trust them to help us find a dog that works for us. I also love that they don't give up on dogs that are hard or impossible to get adopted. In the end, it's not the dogs' fault that they got messed up by us humans. I love you guys and our pups.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1623971684850, 'text': "Thanks for being a repeat adopter.

<pics>None</pics><Text>Notice how they respond mostly to the positive comments in these reviews?
Don't be fooled by any of the photos of dogs running in green backgrounds. Try to find a photo of the actual place. It's filthy and cramped. Staff is rude, unresponsive, purely focused on pumping out dogs as fast as possible with very little welfare check.

The barking lot is TERRIBLE to their fosters. Their actions were deeply hurtful. You'll see their are tons of negative reviews, which shouldn't be ignored. There are consistent themes of unresponsive and rude service by management and filthy and inhumane conditions for the dogs. Absolutely accurate negative reviews.

First, they're pretty unresponsive because they're "too busy". They also take in far more dogs than they can handle, often cramping them in small spaces and cages. They were horrible in communication. Stacy was extremely rude on multiple occasions. Shannon straight up lied and ignored the messages when receipts were shown. They were simply too busy to check on the dogs that had been adopted, therefore having ZERO welfare process.

The place is filthy. They do not let you see the back. (wonder why)

Filthy place, ridiculous adoption fees (Other organizations have lower adoption fees and MUCH better facilities. It's obvious they're not reinvesting any of the money back into improving their shelter) and straight up dishonest staff.< /Text><user_name>Jessica Sanchez<//user_name>< time>

<rate>1< /rate><time>1604809852071</time><Review>This is an establishment that practices in "conversion" of stolen goods. My beloved dog Vaquera (AKA Rosebud, Rosie) was sold to me via another slimy rescue establishment, Mutts & Moms in Pasadena. After 4 years of undeniable love, care, training and companionship, my dog was recovered by Marina Batkis at Mutts & Moms when a worker at my house didn't secure the gate properly. We have all made mistakes in our life, but there was never a moment in 4 years that  I didn't spend trying to ensure this dogs safety, health, happiness and highest level of obedience. She restored so many peoples faith in the breed of Pit Bulls. She was a lover. All she wanted to do is see who was on the other side of the gate and for that she was hidden from me for 2 years! Then Stacy at the Barking Lot worked in concert with Marina to rehome my dog, with full knowledge of the anguish I endured and the great lengths I had gone to to recover my family member. This dog was listed as stolen property with the AVID chip company and a formal stolen property report was filed in Jan 2019.
"2020 Conversion in California is a civil cause of action that applies when a person unlawfully and without permission, took or interfered with someone else's possession of their property."  Might as well refer to it Dog Trafficking in this instance.</Review></record>

It's a wonderful rescue with great people. Our adoption went smoothly and if anything stuff and Stacy the owner was anything but patient with us. There's lot of negative reviews, all in my opinion from lack of understanding what adopting of a pet is really about. There should be commitment for better or worse and if you believe in re-homing after you adopt, in my personal opinion you should not adopt at all. Place doesn't smell roses? Well come and help them out to clean and walk dogs and become a volunteer. Otherwise you have no right to judge. Keeping that many doggies is messy, nothing else to talk about. We had wonderful experience, we absolutely love little girl Mabeline and thinking of adopting another dog as soon as Mae "sattled down" if you will. On a price note, it's really not expensive at all if you would look at what people at the Barking Lot are doing. My vet was very impressed with all the regular blood work and extensive care that has been done on my dog. She had deadly blood infection previously from tick and she was saved. My vet said it's extremely hard to do and his own dog died from same infection. Mae had lipoma that has been removed and her vaccine and deworming was all done in time. Considering all that adoption fee is really not expensive at all. When I came in I had a collar and a leash, but after I've been told why those are not best for my hight fly risk Soi dog, I purchased collar and leash from them, and actually it was cheaper then what I bought from Petco. I would highly recommend this rescue.</Text>

I wanted to add my review because there are a lot of one star reviews and while I definitely don't want to say they're wrong or not true to those reviewer's experiences I remember reading those and having some doubts about coming here. The Barking Lot really worked with me for a long time to schedule different things and find the perfect dog for my needs; on adoption day they were very nice and we brought home the sweetest dog I've ever met.

I'm so glad I went; the only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is that there's always room for improvement I suppose. There were also a few times I booked an appointment that The Barking Lot had to cancel (or times they offered an appointment then rescinded it later because of an issue/timing conflict) but they always emailed back and worked to get a new time. I'm so happy I went and found my sweet dog there :)<//Review>

<text>Extremely rude staff and difficult to work with. The dogs are not fostered in a loving home; they are in a big kennel-type facility. Was told the dog we were meeting was 10 months old and so the adoption fee was high because he was a puppy (much higher than most rescues). I do not believe he was that young. There was absolutely no puppy in this dog. He appeared to be several years old. Was told he had just had a bath and his fur was so matted and uncared for that I wanted to rescue the dog from the rescue. The woman I met with was very defensive when I asked questions about the dog, and so rude! I went with my gut and found a dog elsewhere. I have since thought of calling animal control to do a wellness check on the facility. I got the worst vibes from this place.< /text>< resp>

<gmapID>0x80d959d2a848b841:0xdb82b9c01102d08a< /gmapID><rate>1</rate><Review>the director is quite rude and didn't let us see the dog we initially requested. Not even a meet and greet. It seemed she was a bit possessive over the dog and wasn't quite ready to give them up since she fostered him. Once we found another dog we wanted, we asked to sit in the car to sign the paperwork since it was scorching hot outside. The director refused to let us leave the front steps. We ended up adopting a dog whom we love and adore in every way. However, once we said we wanted the dog, they just didn't tell us anything about the dog besides handing us vaccine records. We later discovered a few behavioral issues such as dog fearfulness and resource guarding which are things I am able to train and work with but it would have been nice to know some background so that we would be prepared. I emailed the adoption email AND the volunteer named Shannon who was in contact with me before the adoption asking for any behavioral issues to look out for and got zero response. It seems once a dog is out of their hands they have zero interest in contacting with us after. I love the fur baby we adopted but did not love my experience with the director and staff there.< /Review>< time>

Adoption process, good.
They make you leave a $100 deposit for a tracker, then after a month you take it or send it back for your money back. I returned it and have yet to see my money. It’s been about 1 and a half months since I have returned it. The person answering my questions says the director should’ve sent it, but that she is so busy that maybe she didn’t send it yet? That’s not my problem. You guys are more focused on getting money by sending dogs off then you are about taking care of your customers whom you owe money to. I keep getting the run around and it is getting old. I’ll update my review once this issue is resolved.<//review>

The process of adopting her went fairly well. Slightly disorganized but considering that they're mostly donation run that's to be expected. I really appreciated that they were able to answer my questions via email about some of my dog's behavioral traits and advice on how to get her to acclimate better. They really care about their dogs. Yes, the adoption price can be a bit steep but Willow has already been microchipped, spayed, and medical problems have been addressed. I got a extensive paperwork on her medical history. This might vary from dog to dog, but I feel like I got considerably good deal since all I had to do afterwards was register her with the county and renew her rabies vaccine.
I'm happy to have brought Willow into my home. She's a joy and a great little familiar. Thank you, Barking Lot!<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOjCyT_HfR-sr63zurk00b3pfze-x7OwoGOYcT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhQcyXHtKjNEu0lOMGKr4llaIcL3F2DQHYL8sj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Not a fan of this rescue! They are a money making business without caring about which home is best suited for a dog. Go to Retriever and Friends instead. They care so much about their animals and the people who adopt them. Barking lot is just a first come first serve with no good communication!<//text>

Their interview process is probably more intense than necessary. It seems they've had the same dogs available for months. I was denied adoption because I was the owner of an "unaltered" female dog. It didn't seem to matter that she was recently adopted AND scheduled for her spay surgery two days after The Barking Lot emailed the denial. My application included both details.</Review>

Been there earlier this year. I schedule an appointment before visiting and was informed as I got there that it was canceled through email. After checking my email to verify, I didn’t see any email about an appointment being canceled. The worker if used to serve my family and I. We watched as she served other customer is refusing to let my family see the puppy that we requested. Instead of coming and talk clearly to us but she let us wait for 3 hours until finally she came and said that the puppy we had chosen can’t be adopted today because the pup has a playdate with someone else tomorrow, even though on the site says that “Adoptions are on a first come/first served basis for qualified applicants that have completed ALL steps in our process.”  I have done every process and even got an appointment. After waiting for a couple hours without being seated my family and I left very upset and unsatisfied.< /Review>

We adopted the most precious Pittmaraner and could not be happier. Friendly attentive staff and seamlessly easy process. Highly recommended ❤️❤️❤️ Our sweet Lilly (barking lot renamed her Lotus, but we changed it back to her original name) is the center of our family.  She’s now officially a military fur-brat!<//Text>

<review>The process to adopt our Mercury was great! There are alot of questions and we had about two -3 interviews but I honestly liked that because the rescue needs to be assured that the puppy was going to a good home. We love our boy so much and he has brought nothing but joy to our family. The staff was awesome and we will be forever grateful! Thank you Barking Lot!< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>This place is not what it seems. We filled out all required paperwork. Up front about our schedule and home. It took awhile to hear back from them. But then we got an email that we could schedule an appointment to meet two puppies from the same litter. We emailed back when we were available from the days and times they indicated. That was on Thursday evening and we responded that same evening. We got an email Sunday morning that we were scheduled to meet them in a few hours. When we showed up we were only greeted with one of the two we were told about. Nonetheless we fell in love with the one we did meet. We hung out with her for quiet sometime. We paid our adoption fee of $550.00, received the puppy's paperwork and a gift bag. We spoke to one of the volunteers who told us we could pick up our puppy that following Tuesday after being spayed. She said everything looked perfect. Then she asked if we had our home visit, which we hadn't. That was scheduled for Tuesday morning on the Monday before. We went out the next few days and prepped for her arrival, about $500.00+. I did the home visit, answered all the same questions again and before I hung up with the volunteer she was congratulating us on our adoption. My boyfriend made sure to take time off work so we could pick her up. (Losing 2 hours of pay in the process.) We received a congratulations email and them shortly thereafter another email that said they were NOT going to allow us to adopt. They indicated it was because of our schedules. Which had not been an issue in the process at anytime. We were advised that we could still adopt but they would only allow us to adopt a puppy 6 months or older. There was no discussion and trying to reach ANYONE proves very difficult. When we finally heard from the owner she was very patronizing. Essentially they pulled a "bait and switch". We were there for a cute puppy we instantly bonded with, only to be told we couldn't have that one but they'd give us an older one. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PLACE!!!! There are plenty of other places that need adoptees.</text>< pictures>

<review>Do your own homework and ask the uncomfortable questions about the dogs from this place because they misrepresent them in their bios here and the owner claims to not be responsible for what’s written in them. Upon meeting our dog the only verbal discussion of his behavior was that he needed structure. Come to find out, Rocket is prone to fits of unprovoked aggression and will attack and bite (breaking the skin). It wasn’t until we did our research to get his rabies cert (that wasn’t provided by The Barking Lot) did anyone from his past mention the history of such behavior, as his antics were well known.

After speaking with numerous trainers we found ourselves unable to be liable for Rocket’s behavior. We brought him back to Barking Lot for surrender, only to be patronized and then yelled at by the owner Stacy. Thankfully we recorded the encounter once she became hostile. Never did she try to see what help Rocket needed or what his well-being was before or when we brought him back. She was simply concerned with this petty ego trip and seemed to be put off that we would return him after allowing him to be adopted under false pretenses. Stacy should not adopt dogs out if she’s not willing to be honest and vet the dogs appropriately. He’s going to be put down unnecessarily for biting someone else or God forbid a child, because she would release him to another home without disclosing his true issues just to get him off of her hands just like she did with us, because he was put back up for adoption again only a few days after his return, with no editing done to his bio to reflect his true behavior. Thankfully over a month later, it has been updated, but only with a warning about him needing a four legged sibling and not placing him in a home with children. Steer clear from here. There are so many other more reputable rescues that you should adopt from. This place is all about the money not about the dogs.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Love my new Banjo, a true SOI dog.   It's been 7 weeks, and we are getting slowly but surely closer to each other; although he still won't come when I call him, so the leash is the only answer at this time.  However, he is starting to trust me, sleeps next to my bed, etc.  Small tokens of love.  Adopting a SOI dog is not easy; it takes a lot of patience, and I'm happy I work from home so I could see him many times during the day.  The first 3 weeks, he spent outside in the yard where he made himself a bed under a tree, now he likes his bed better.  The Barking Lot gave it to me straight when I adopted this dog; it could take 4-6 months, which was the most honest answer I could have hoped for.  My German Shepard, Deedee is loving and patient and a good sister.  In my opinion, yes, the place stinks of urine, but the process was thorough, the ladies who I encountered, friendly, and home inspection properly.   Maybe one item missing is follow up by management.  Just a thought.< /text>

<Text>I really tried with The Barking Lot. I did. I applied to foster a dog that had been there for over a year. The application states that I would receive a response in 1 business day. I never received a response but saw on the TBL Instagram page that he had been placed in a foster home so I was content and let it go. About a month later I got an email from Shannon regarding fostering the dog. The virtual home visit was scheduled within a week with Elise and I was ready to take the dog as long as it was a good fit. For the next month Shannon and I went back and forth trying to find a good time for me to meet the dog and see if he was a good fit for my home. Even though there were times when I wouldn’t receive a response and I would have to follow up-which I found strange given that the dog had been at the kennel for over a year and I would think they would be eager to get him into a foster home-I was understanding because I know things are tough due to the pandemic. Finally, we found a time that worked for both of us and I went to meet the dog yesterday. As soon as I opened the door, Stacy sternly told me to wait outside. Ok, no problem. But there is no sign on the door that says to wait outside and she made no attempts to communicate with me that she will be right with me or even ask what I was there for. 15 minutes pass and she still has not come out. I peek my head in the window and she gives me an annoyed look and says “I know!” She then comes out and tells me to wait on the sidewalk. She helps someone that had been there before me and then finally comes up to me. She begins to ask me question that I had already been asked by Elise and Shannon and very rudely tells me that it is not up to me to determine if the dog is a good fit, but it is up to her. She goes to get the dog and brings him out. The interaction lasted but 5 minutes and was very uncomfortable as we were in the middle of the sidewalk and my dog was already anxious after waiting for almost 30 minutes. I found this strange, as the other 2 people who were there were sitting down and had had at least 30 minutes to interact with the dogs that they were interested in. She was very short with her answers to questions and seemed that she had already made the decision that he wasn’t a good fit prior to even bringing him out. She then says she has to go help someone else out but has a dog that she feels would be a better fit. She goes to help the other person and goes back inside and never comes back out with another dog. After waiting another 15 minutes we decide to leave. I understand that maybe customer service is maybe not the priority when running a dog rescue but maybe putting out a little kindness and treating people decently especially when they are trying to do something good in this world. I feel sad that the dog will remain in the shelter and feel that with a little more time to interact we would have gotten a better idea if it was a good fit, but that is on them. I really tried. Thanks to Shannon and Elise and good luck!<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>I decided to read the google reviews on our way to our appointment. Big mistake. It put a bad taste in my mouth and had me second guessing my choice to try them. The reviews tell you how bad Stacy, the owner is, and yeah I saw that she can get an attitude, but I think she just can’t stand stupid people or ones who have attitude themselves. She was a little rough around the edges but definitely opened up and was quite lovely the more we talked to her. She knows a lot about the dogs and cares for them like her own. The “loud music” that people refer to was in the office area and seemed pretty mellow and calming to the maybe 6-8 dogs she had in there lounging. She also had a diffuser with essential oils. It didn’t seem overly dirty. I didn’t see any dogs “covered” in pee or poop except maybe one that was being adopted that day-it did have wet legs but maybe that was post bath or something?? It didn’t smell like flowers and candy but it certainly didn’t smell like poop, it smelled like dog and being that there are a ton of dogs on site-we asked and she said 80-100 at any given time-I’d assume it can’t be sparkling every moment. And yeah, you’ll hear barking, they are dogs, that’s what they do, duh!

I’m just so happy and thankful that we finally found our forever pup! Extra thanks to The Barking Lot for having your K9ers walks on the weekends! If you haven’t heard of it, go to Facebook and join one! They are one Saturday a month and you sign up to walk a dog in nature for an hour, it’s great! This place seriously cares about where the dogs go for their forever homes so expect to be put through an interview and get a house inspection before even considering a dog. We walked a dog one of the times and fell in love, put an application in right after the walk and found out later that the dog had already been adopted. Our adoption coordinator left little to be desired but she did get us an appointment on the books and that is all we wanted/needed to find the furpup of our dreams! I must say, the volunteers at K9ers are the real reason we have such a positive outlook on The Barking Lot plus the appointment day went great! Do expect to spend a few hours there and that it may be busy so your appointment time may be pushed back. Have patience and you will be rewarded. They give you plenty of time to walk dogs so use it to get to know each one and see who fits you! To top it all off, they also give you a goody bag full of toys, treats and food that is quite full and has some really great stuff!<//Text>< pics>

<text>Did not have a good experience. Filled out a lengthy application only to be asked the same questions again when we went in for our appointment, her response was "well I didn't look at your application." You have to make an appointment but there is only one person actually helping you and we had to wait 40 minutes past our appointment time to even be talked to. The lady was very condescending and continually questioned our ability as dog owners, even though we had a dog with us we already own, and I gave all the answers in the application. They were very pushy and didn't really care if their dog was meshing with ours. There is nowhere to actually lets the dogs off the leash and interact with them so you don't really have a good interaction. Also the dogs are very expensive for unknown reasons. We were given little to no information about the process and the dog we were interested in until we were there. The information on their website about the dog we were interested in was inaccurate, and more information should have been disclosed before we went.</text>< UserId.>

My husband and I had a wonderful experience with the Barking Lot. Their staff were extremely helpful and courteous throughout the adoption process. We adopted a sweet pup and gave her a forever home. We found them to be organized and very dedicated in finding forever homes for their dogs. They truly care for their dogs and ensure the dogs go to good homes. We had only positive experience with them.< /Review>

<Review>-READ THE LOW RATING REVIEWS BEFORE YOU ADOPT FROM THIS LOCATION. THERE IS A PATTERN ON HOW THEY CONDUCT POOR SERVICE AND LACKLUSTER PROCESSING DOG ADOPTION. THE OWNER ONLY REPLIES WHEN SHE THINKS SHE CAN JUSTIFY THE COMPLAINT. FOR THE RECORD, YOU CONTINUED TO PROCESS MY ADOPTION EVEN WITH OVERDUE VACCINES. STOP DEFENDING YOUR CASE AND SIMPLY ADMIT THAT YOU MAKE MISTAKES. PLEASE CORRECT YOUR BUSINESS PRACTICE AND ACTUALLY GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER.

-mandatory collar and gps tracker needs to be purchased from this place. Courtesy by Stacy.
-unreliable missing medical records and overdue vaccines
-extra fees and etc

THIS PLACE IS NOT IN A GOOD SHAPE. I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED TO TAKE THE DOG HOME BUT I'D RATHER DEAL WITH A DIFFERENT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. THEY BASICALLY DROP ALL THE LOAD ON YOU.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I feel the need to defend myself and my family. We adopted a dog (gumtree was his given name and currently up for adoption) as a 11 weeks old puppy right before New Years this year. It was love at first sight and what we felt was a perfect match for our family of four plus one fur baby already. We brought him into our home and within days found him to be food/treat aggressive. He bit both of my children and myself, not bad enough to seek medical attention, but I do have photo proof. I personally asked a behavior veterinarian what steps to take to train him out of this behavior and followed through. Remington, what we named him, had come to us with Neospora caninum that had gone untreated and also spread to our other dog. We treated that and vaccinated him on time. We treated Remi as part of the family and worked hard on training him, that’s why the barking lot is able to say he is a good pup, but, as I was told by an animal medical professional, some food aggression can not be fixed. Sadly as Remi grew he became more aggressive with food, treats, toys, and even attention and the safety of our small children and other dog became an issue. There was no need to say that his aggression went unnoticed and unattended to. We did everything we could and kept him in our house, despite his behavior, for longer than we should have. He should not be placed with a family with small children, or really other animals. Yes he gets along with dogs, but add food, treats, or even affection and he could do major harm.  The whole experience with this faculty has been less than mediocre. From watching Stacy make customers cry, talking poorly about her volunteers, to putting our family on blast in a description of our former dog. It’s all really unprofessional. We hope and pray that Gumtree/Remington finds a good home, but we also hope that families are made aware of the real reason he had to be brought back.<//text>

<review>Objectively: they take those dog who would likely otherwise die and give them opportunities.

Subjectively: these dogs generally have issues either genetically or from life experience. Think very carefully about the breed and history. Dog adoption is like a roughly 10 year marriage. Be very honest with yourself about what you want.<//review>< pictures>

<review>My husband and I had a really bad experience here that had me nearly swearing off dogs completely. The dog was supposedly good with people and other dogs. He snapped at my office manager after growling and barking at her previously and muzzle punched the Vet. He couldn’t enter the dog park because his hackles were raised and he was growling at the dogs through the fence. $500 down the drain as our apartment does not allow aggressive dogs. Upon driving 2 hours to return him due to their policy of returning him where we got him or paying $1000, with myself in tears, I was told it was probably my fault as the owner. So, I felt horrible about myself while giving up This dog that had started to bond with my husband and I.

Fast forward to now, where we have an adorable puppy from the humane society that was a mere $117 as compared to a full grown dog for $500 (unheard of!) and he is doing wonderful with us. Socializing perfectly and loving everyone and everything he meets.

You don’t get your money back people... just adopt from the humane society.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

Owner (Stacy) was very rude and condescending. Place is filthy and seems like it hasn't been cleaned in years, dogs don't look happy 😔 good luck if you have any questions or want to go see multiple dogs that you're interested in, the owner made us feel like we were taking up her precious time! Horrible experience. We put in an application for a  Wheaton Terrier and they kept pushing the appointment back, come to find out the dog went missing for weeks, and when they finally got him back they let the first person through the door adopt him, even though we already had an appointment to meet him for over a month, but they lost him and wanted to give him up in case he flees again 🙄< /Text>

Adopted Sadie a yellow lab in 2007.  She was 6.  Had been at a breeding facility.  She was very shy.  Did not bark for at least 6 months.  She is the love of our aged lives.  She is outgoing.  Very good with all dogs.  She trully brings joy to our lives.<//review>

Horrible, horrible communication. Our adoption coordinator would only send one reply every 24-48 hours. Then she mixed up the process, and *first* had us meet the pup we wanted to adopt (fell in love with him) before the home inspection.

We passed our interview with the owner, but I was never more uncomfortable in my life. She treated us like we were violent criminals. Because we didn’t have the home inspection first, she had to take the pup from us at the end of the play date. And you know, it was sad to see him be led into the back. It was extremely dark and dingy. It sounded like dogs were fighting, with LOUD music trying to drown them out... super weird and just depressing.

And in the end, the pup that was originally listed as good with children was denied to us. Apparently his brother had a bad experience with little ones. We were so disappointed  to hear this. I understand how careful they need to be, but they were overboard and denied this dog to a family who would have loved him for the rest of his life.

We were told we could look at other dogs, but when our coordinator failed to make us an appointment (because she is too busy to volunteer—actually, why volunteer, Kelly?) we decided to adopt elsewhere. I couldn’t put my family though anymore heartache. :(<//review>

<user_name>Beth Gajewski< /user_name><Review>We adopted our puppy from here in November of 2018. She was the last to be adopted from a litter because she was very “shy” and standoffish. Well...she wasn’t shy, she was sick. For a place that insists on seeing your home before they give you a dog they charge you over $500 for, they don’t take very good care of them. Our puppy was at The Barking Lot from when she was two days old to when we adopted her at 12.5 weeks old. We did a fecal test after bringing her home and she had both hookworm and giardia. Furthermore, her spay surgery healed wrong and her intestine was twisted up against itself and she nearly died and had to have emergency surgery.

These people should not be in the business of caring for dogs. We love our puppy and she’s fine now, no thanks to The Barking Lot. There are agencies in San Diego that adopt out healthy dogs for less than $100. We paid over $500 for a sick one from people who treated us like suspicious people until they got our credit card. Frauds.</Review><userid>111323654773679307341<//userid><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The facility is old and  badly needs upgrades and just general maintenence. They rescue and adopt out dogs from US, Mexico, Thailand and China. They boast of adopting out 715 dog in 2018, which is amazing! They are entirely donation run-and so I would assume the $$ all goes back into caring for the dogs and not maintaining the facility. Really have mixed feelings about it.</Review>< Pics>

The reason why I am rating a 1 star is because so me and my mom were going to the barking lot and it’s raining and we’re cold so one of the ladies sees us and ignores us and yes they have to take care of the dogs but can you at least put up the umbrella and so we wait and someone opens the door now we had a appointment with a specific dog and we meet some other dog than we ask if we can meet the dog we had an appointment with and they say no because if she doesn’t have a friend with her she will be shy but all shelter dogs are like that so we give a dog a chance and the dog we just met was going to be our new dog then so my mom was just doing the paperwork and so I was waiting and the dog goes under the chair with the leash and I didn’t want my new dog to be stuck to chair so I get the leash put it gently on the floor and put my foot on it and one of the ladies sees this and she thinks I just left the leash on the ground so she starts talking to my mom and says “Are you going to take this seriously!!” And then they take the dog and just put it with the other dogs and so there was my story of why the stupid barking lot wont let us get our dog.

A wonderful rescue that truly cares about their dogs, and goes to great lengths to ensure that a pup is going into a good home. Yes, there are a few hoops to jump through (detailed application, home check, and an appointment must be made in order to meet dogs) but this is all for the sake of the dogs. My experience was extremely positive: My coordinator was very responsive (answered all questions I had before adopting, made recommendations of dogs that might be a good fit for me, and helped me with questions post-adoption, too), the process was streamlined, and I was truly impressed that The Barking Lot is able to accomplish so much with a 100% volunteer staff. Plus, they matched me up with the furry little love of my life, Scooter. I loved my experience so much that I became a volunteer for TBL, which has also been a truly rewarding experience.< /review>

I'm not in the habit of writing negative reviews but after I visited the Barking Lot I knew I wanted to warn people about this place. For weeks I was emailing back and forth with a representative about a certain dog I wanted to see. When I arrive I was told the dog had already been adopted. The dogs they brought out for me to see were filthy, covered in dirt and god knows what. The facility smelled horrible and the adoption fees were way too high for a shelter that should really be run much better. My advice is to steer clear of the Barking Lot and find other places to find your dog.< /text>

<review>Applied to look at a puppy and they denied the application without giving a reason...none of my answers should have been red flags. It seems they only let you look at dogs if you lie on your application, even though I cant imagine what I would need to change. We own a condo and take long walks with our dog every day, but they didn't even give us a chance or a home inspection. It's complete nonsense...a good owner comes along and they don't let them have a dog. It should always be face to face, and even then I've heard they've discriminated against people even after approving their online application. I've always taken great care of my dog and this organization slammed the door in my face without even meeting me. I've never put a dog down or taken a dog to the shelter...if you don't have a huge yard or never leave your house then good luck getting them to give you a dog.</review><UserId.>100412735682131661524<//UserId.>< response>

Very poor customer service. The dogs seemed nice but the woman forced me and my grandmother outside. Before we left she told us not to try and pet any dogs, even though we weren’t (they all lay around the store together). We will not be going back.

< review>
We had a great experience with the Barking Lot. We submitted our application online, scheduled a home visit within a week, and went to meet dogs a couple days after that. The dog we originally had our eye on was being adopted when we arrived, so they listened to what we were looking for and introduced us to several other dogs who fit the bill. They give you as much time as you need with each dog and let you take them for a little walk to get to know them. We fell in love with one and picked her up the next day after she had been spayed. Every dog we met was healthy, happy, and well cared for. The volunteers clearly love the dogs and care deeply about matching them with great homes. As other reviews have mentioned, communication isn't always immediate, and it's not the most organized place on earth. I imagine this is because they are a donation-based, volunteer-run organization rescuing dogs from literally all over the world. They have a lot going on, and what they do is not easy. Be patient and follow their process, and you won't have any issues.< /review>

The Barking lot is a shelter that gets absolutely no county or city funds. We used to volunteer there and, yes it is a bit dirty and smelly because they don’t have the funds like the Humane Society or other county shelters. However, if you can get beyond these exteriors of abruptness, and appearance I’d the shelter, You can experience what we did: everyone at the Barking Lot, working and volunteering, has a very big and good heart.

Stacey saved our beautiful dog, Big Boy aka Biggy.  A beautiful, pure white, American Bulldog/pit bull mix.
He was dragged behind a car, had broken and missing teeth from being hit, and appeared he could have died from starvation alone. He had twine tucked deeply into his skin around his mouth so as not to eat.  Biggie was in line to be euthanized.  Stacey saved him.

And by doing this, the Barking Lot gave my family the most unbelievably warm, gentle, intuitive, and lovable dog I have ever had or seen in my life.  As our adopted 2 year old grew, who also had physical issues of her own, Big Boy and she became tightly bonded.  Big Boy has been the love of our lives, especially our daughter’s, who is now 6 years old.
Big Boy got cancer a few months ago in the leg that they dragged him by, and which he never recovered.  A few weeks ago, Big Boy passed away.  He hung on for all of us as we were all so close.  Prior to us knowing he had cancer, my husband ran into Stacey with Big Boy.  My husband said that Biggie immediately knew Stacey and gave her his gratitude, in his special way.

So, perhaps the Barking Lot smells, isn’t that clean, and I have also experienced a bit of abruptness by the staff. However,  when it comes to rescuing and saving thousands of dogs on small amount of funds, these folks know what they’re doing.  Please trust me. You may be missing the dog of your lifetime, as we had with Big Boy.

All my gratitude to the Barking Lot-

Terrible communication... they can’t even seem to tell you that they don’t want you to adopt the dog. They just don’t reply back. One worker was friendly... the rest had some sort of god complex to them. It was strange. One of the older women working was super judgey of my husband and I for being a young military couple. They said the next step would be a home check, I just mentioned that it would be a little difficult since we like on a military base.. the whole conversation went downwards from there. She didn’t seem to believe that we could be capable of caring for a dog, even though we’ve had a cat together for 6 years. She kept giving us gross looks. Basically my husband and I drove 3 hours to get our hopes up about a dog and they never got back to us. Not sure how they want to find homes for all these rescues if they keep denying decent people capable of caring for a pet. I wouldn’t recommend going here to anyone. The place was dirty and smelled of urine. Poor dogs were dehydrated and dirty. Bless the animals.</Text>

<Response>None</Response><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Poor communication between each other and adopters. Also, not an honest and forthright business. My family was denied the ability to adopt twice even though they continued to set up appointments and would even suggest dogs that might be a good fit. The reason? We never actually received a reason even though we had the dog picked out and setup an appointment to pick her up. When my husband took work off early to go get her, they told him “she isn’t spayed, yet”. They stopped replying to emails after that so we couldn’t figure out what was going on. Eventually, if they still aren’t answering, just tell them you’ll stop wasting your time with unanswered emails and phone calls and you’ll just show up there during business hours without an appointment to get your answer. They’ll answer your emails then. Dishonest and shady. Not to mention, the place is extremely dirty.

Go somewhere decent that cares about where their dogs end up and is forthright and honest with adopters. Go somewhere where the volunteers and staff aren’t afraid to talk to you in person and don’t have a chip on their shoulder. Let’s be honest, TBL, you’re not doing anything “better” than any of the other pet rescues in San Diego. You disguise a dirty environment and unprofessional attitudes with professional pictures of the dogs you have available. Why don’t you use the high price you charge for the adoption fee to clean the place up a little and get some people in there that take pride in their work and volunteer work. Take some intiative.< /Text></record>

We love the Barking Lot! They bring a personal experience to adopting an animal. Prior to adopting out their dogs, they have you fill out an application and do a home visit. After the adoption, they follow up with you and encourage you to keep in touch and send pictures. They also do walks with their dogs at various locations to spread the word about their rescue and give their dogs some much needed exercise and love. We've adopted two dogs from them and had a great experience both times. The only reason I gave them a 4/5 is because they're more expensive than the local county animal shelter and the last time we were there we had to wait a bit to finish the adoption process, but honestly those things are minuscule.  Go here!</text>

Denied my application with no explanation... Had dogs all my life. Have pet sit for the last two years and have over 45 5 star reviews... work from home... fully fenced yard... my dogs have never been mistreated. Lived out their lives and passed of old age... I don't return dogs based on issues... I get help and solve them... can't understand why I was denied... Seems to me they base their qualifications on appearances, not who will love their pet more then most do thier children... This place blows hard.< /review>

< Review>
I met my sweetie, Cubbie, at The Barking Lot a little more than a year ago. I was impressed with how much the mostly volunteer staff loves the dogs and wants to find them good homes. I like that they operate by appointment only, to ensure each potential parent is given the necessary attention. The dogs seem happy, a far cry from those in shelters.</Review>

< Review>
Finally getting around to this review after several months. The place is horrid, smells strongly of urine and feces. The other potential adopters there complained about it as well. The 4 dogs I met were all EXTREMELY dirty to the point my hands were grey with dirt and grease. Only way of interacting with dogs is through walking them, no way to tell how they do off leash. Very little seating. Also needed their nails trimmed. I felt so sorry for them. Lots of dogs barking and humans yelling. Took an hour to get anyone to help me. Extremely high adoption fees. I get it, rescues run on donations only but with what I've mentioned above among other things, they make their rescue very undesirable. Appointment only. Would never set foot there again nor adopt from them.
I would a million times over go through the Humane Society.<//Review>

Medication is not always done regularly due to her inability to manage time well and give employees notice of which animals need what medications. She tends to give a noticeable idea that the money made from adoptions is more important than the dogs themselves. She also does not pay employees on time sometimes going far beyond the STATE LAW REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO PAY EMPLOYEES WITHIN 72 HOURS AFTER THEIR RESIGNATION. Would strongly recommend anyone thinking about adopting from The Barking Lot, volunteering, or working for The Barking Lot to completely avoid.

<review>I was also denied, but I know why. She saw that I was a smoker and said "you smoke in your house" even though I had passed a home inspection. I rent my house and am not allowed to smoke it in, but I have never smoked in my houses in over 40 years, but there was no point in arguing with her.
The poor dog named Brenner, who had been there for 8 months and is still there now, is probably kept in a crate in that small building which I hear does not smell too good. She did not want me going inside when I went for my visit, and poor Brenner was stressed out. They brought him out wet and handed him to me. The poor guy was scared to death and even tried biting her when she took him back from me. I could not believe what was happening. That poor dog would be so much better off with me then being abused by those judgmental people who care more about their power over other humans then they do about the poor animals they are supposed to be taking care of. I love animals, but some people are sick.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<response>None< /response><Text>Filling out the application and making an appointment makes sure you and your family think it all through and do not make an impulsive decision that you might regret. Thank you to everyone in The Barking Lot team for doing the hard and emotionally challenging work of taking these dogs out of critical conditions and getting them ready to be best friend!
I've been looking into different rescues for over a year now. The first one was a sight hound rescue. We were looking for an Ibizan Hound because they are amazing dogs and we heard of the plight that they are suffering in Spain. These dogs are really rare and adopting them is way expensive, and then you have to be on a list. So, now to see you guys doing similar work really makes me want to be a part of your effort!
With so many loving and worthy dogs to learn about,  (I was told up to 80 in the care of TBL at any point) it makes the adoption process fun and educational.
We were able to find what we believe to be a little sight hound mix after all, and she came from Mexico. She was very healthy with their care, is such a sweetie, and very smart girl! She learned how to sit, lay down, fetch, and even comes when called already! She is so much fun to play ball and hike with, and the other older dogs around our place are truly enjoying her playfulness.
There are so many awesome pups in there waiting for a loving home, and the staff have built up their relationships with each dog to help make the best match.</Text>< user>

<review>This is a Rescue place for dogs. They deal  with dogs that are Shiba Inu, So I. Dogsfrom Asia. I had a great time picking out a dog and he is wonderful. Couldn't be happier. Levi is a gem.The rescue is open on certain days. They do have standards about who they deal with because they want to be sure that their dogs get the best match and a great home.I commend them for what they do. I think its a great place for choosing great dogs.< /review></record>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Adopted a great dog from here. When we brought him home, we noticed he had a limp. We got x-rays done and it turns out he had broken his leg as a puppy and it healed on its own since he was a stray. Unfortunately, the bone stopped growing so his leg is shorter than the other one. When we got him, he was only 8 months so he was still growing and we're worried his bad leg is going to cause issues down the line especially if he gets tall enough that the leg won't reach the ground. We called the barking lot and told them our concerns. After a few calls and emails, they stopped taking our calls and won't respond to our emails. The last email we received was them telling us they talked to their orthopedic surgeon and he said our dog would have no issues. How does he know this without even looking at our dog? All we asked of them was to get us an appointment with their surgeon and then maybe help with some of the medical costs if something needed to be done. They never disclosed his injury to us at adoption so I think they should pay for some of the medical bills especially when they're charging almost $500 for a stray dog. This place is a total scam. They're just interested in making money. They don't care about the dogs they care for.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>The employees are great.  I will say we have been trying to adopt a dog is not easy.  There is so much miscommunication that happens that makes you want to give up. I looked at the shelter, humane society, second chance rescue & The Barking Lot.  I was ready to give up.  We were going to just go through a breeder. When after a couple of months I saw Tarth the dog I had been wanting to look for our family.  I decide to contact The barking lot directly via email.  I finally got a response.   I let them know I had put in 3 applications for a dog and didn't hear back.  I said I still see the dog is avaible on the website. Finally things started moving forward.  They gave me a link that work for the application and with in 4 days we were able to adopted our dog.  I would go back to them again.</review><gmap_id>0x80d959d2a848b841:0xdb82b9c01102d08a<//gmap_id><name>Michelle Mitchell< /name><time>1472160169575< /time><response>None<//response><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>4< /Rating></record>

Dreadful communication policy(?). Talk with 4 different people, get 4 completely different answers. Totally disorganized.

Basically, it was communication whiplash.

I'm glad that they are rescuing dogs, so don't get me wrong. But I will never go back to this place.< /review>

Must have an appointment before you go. They dont have kennels to walk through and look at dogs. You have to pick a dog you want to see and make the appointment. All and I mean ALL the dogs are super attached to the owner. They charge around $300 for each dog. Your allowed to take them for a walk around the street but aren't allowed to get near other dogs.
During our appointment a couple took a dog for a walk. A few moments later they came running back saying the dog escaped. We had another appointment the next day to introduce our cat to one of the dogs we were interested in. They said due to the dog still missing we had to reschedule. They said come back at 2. Good thing we told ourselves nevermind, because 30 minutes prior to 2 they cancelled. I understand a lost dog is worrying but to shut down a whole rescue is ridiculous. This place has no good communication and is very unorganized.
Afterwards we went to the San Diego Humane Society (which we've always gotten our animals in the past) and found a beautiful 1 year and 2 month old red husky for $60. Spayed, chip, everything  $60 total.
I really recommend to check out the Humane Society instead! 👌<//text>

While there are times where you may have to wait longer than you want for a response you have to remember these are all volunteers running a non-profit rescue program.  I found 2 of my 3 furkids at The Barking Lot and couldn't be happier.  Thank you for bringing me my Sonoma girl and my Dobby....they are wonderful members of our family.< /text>

Very poor communication and customer service. My memory was triggered by a movie and I realized I did not share my experience. Not knowing they only took appointments we stopped by to check on a litter they had in. The dogs were covered in urine and the place stunk. We asked to see one of the dogs and the woman who was there (who was not the bad experience, she was nice) let us take the pup outside and pet it. We decided we wanted the dog and filled out the application and sent it in. They told us the dog was no longer available, so I asked about the others and got a blast in the face. Here’s the emails, X’s are fillers.
From me

We went by and saw tri tip. I would like to set up a home inspection. I live at xxxxxxx. San diego. Please call me. Xxxxxxxxx

From them
Hello Frederick,

I spoke with Stacy after your visit.  After discussion and circumstances of having others in line for the puppies determined that we will not proceed with a home check in this instance.  I say it that way, because you are welcome to reapply in the future.

Respectfully,
Jill
Barking Lot volunteer

From me
I am not sure if I understood your email. Does that mean that all of the puppies in that litter are reserved? Thanks

Rick

From them

Sorry, Rick, for being unclear.  I was beating around the bush, in order to save feelings.  It means we aren't willing to adopt a puppy to you at this time.  I apologize for my indirectness.

Jill

And then from me,

Wow, no hard feelings. This is just a little shocking to me that you would deny my request for a dog based on your judgement of what? You have a kennel full of piss covered puppies in a building that smells like a rotting porta potty and by some great judgement you somehow found my family unfit to pay $350 for a rescue. You guys are doing a great thing, but I have to express how highly offended I am. So in closing, yeah, there are hard feelings... I will not be reapplying.

Very Respectfuly

Rick

As you can tell I was angry because I was 30 years old (past tense) with a good stable home and job, no record, nothing in that I could imagine they would deny me to adopt a dog.

God bless em for helping these dogs, but I immediately went a paid for a German Shepard who I am currently watching beg my 6 year old son for his food. This dog is a valued member of the family, much like the dog we got denied would have been.

Hopefully they have new staff, maybe when I move back to San Diego in 2018 I will reapply and fit the bill this time around 😂😂😂😂<//Review>

There might be some misunderstadings about the low adoption rate. Howerver, do note that the rescue really cares about their dogs and have responsibility and heart to find them a loving home. To be a good candiate to adopt a dog, it Is very important that you are showing responsibity and commitment. Thousands of dogs are abandoned yearly due to various reasons. :(

Overall, I'd say that the process is worth it and I have successfully adopted an adorable Lab from TCL!<//review><Name>Zoey Xu</Name><Gmap_id>0x80d959d2a848b841:0xdb82b9c01102d08a</Gmap_id><date>1500065159411</date>< pics>

I am so confused as to why they denied our application. The only reasoning that I can conclude, since I asked and got no response, is that we rehomed our last pet instead of our daughter. Chester our 5 year old Chihuahua was biting our daughter, who was 12 months at the time, so we rehomed him to friends that we go to church with. If our daughter got close to him he would snip at her. No we did not take him for proffesional training. We felt best to let him live with our friends. That is the nature of small dogs. And at 5 yrs old it is highly doubtful that he would be able to be trained to like small children. So when we seen a puppy on the Barking lot website we filled out the apication. Unlike Chester this puppy could grow up around children. We even carried a Wellness Plan for Chester, which we plan to do for the next pet, that is basically pet health insurance. So my question is why do we not meet the criteria?!?!?!?! Loving home, gated yard, and I'm a stay at home mom. That means I would have plenty to of time to train a puppy! Makes me wonder if they are just collecting data from the applications!!!!!</Text>

I understand the appointment only process they have benefits the way they operates and the pets. but during my recent visit i had a very disappointing experience due to the way they treated me. I have spent the last week looking at many different avenues of adoption and considered this location. I was in the area and wanted to stop by to schedule an appointment. They choose to speak to me through a crack in a window, Im hoping for a good reason like dogs were out and they didn't want any to get free. because if that was not the reason then she did it because she thought that would be a great way to communicate with someone outside. Im sure hoping there was a reasonable justification, eather way a very weird and uncomfortable expereance<//Review>

<Review>Had the most disappointing experience.  Felt we were totally misled during a two week process.  No ability to communicate as they won't speak with you.  After jumping through hoops came to learn we were at least 3rd in line and had virtually no chance to get the dog.<//Review>< pics>

The place reeks of urine, Lots of dogs in confined spaces(office)  They blast the stereo which cant be good for the dogs hearing all day. Very unprofessionally run. I am going to report this business to officials since they refuse to turn down the music and the awful smell of urine permeating from this so called Dog Rescue</review>

We picked up our pet from there and was told 2 weeks before that he had been neutered a week prior. When we picked him up, he had been neutered the day before we picked him up. They did not tell us this or have a cone on him so he would not lick the area. It got infected and had to put him on antibiotics and take him in every 3 days to the vet for them to check him. We had to do this until we had him for almost a month. Their process is not a great one for sure. I have not recommended them to anyone because of the process (not disclosing, will not talk on the phone, emails not explaining everything, not getting answers to our questions). We fell in love with our baby and was hooked so couldn't back away after we met him, that's how they hook you!< /review>

< Review>
We have found and bought some real deals here.    Helpful staff.   You have to check it out.  Here is our last buy.   A hand made gold men’s chain.   One of a kind.   This is a great place to buy stuff.

Even found this for a Christmas present.

Lots of tools, games, tv’s some surprisingly nice jewelry and other items you would expect to find.

<text>I was thinking of a local place that may have cameras in site that im interested in purchasing and thought of pawn shops. So as i am browsing at some local places on the 209 area i came apon Mid Valley Pawn. On there web site gives you an option to mesage with one of there staff if needed. So i used that option and was sent a response very quickly and thero. The next few days following, i made a trip to there store and purchased my now newly owned T6 canon eos rebel.  Im very pleased with it and am glad to have made the decision of choosing them. Will definitely
go there for further shopping.< /text>< rate>

A major shout out to the crew at Mid Valley Pawn, especially my dude Zach! I've been a customer at MVP for the past few years and these guys have always treated me right; fair prices when both buying and selling and a willingness to find a solution that best fits all parties involved. Thanks again boys!< /Review>

<Review>These guys are the best! This is not your run of the mill pawn shop. Josh, Zach and now Mike are a bunch of pros. They treat you with respect and very hospitable. Super clean, well stocked and merchandised cleanly. I make the trip from Modesto to visit fairly often lately bc these guys are great to do business with!< /Review></record>

Mid Valley pawn is my new go to store. Continually, time after time I’m always amazed at the unique collection of merchandise they have for sale. Everything from New and used tools, to music equipment, sports memorabilia, precious coins and bullion, Their large displays of jewelry, electronics and awesome collection of certified high end designer hand bags. I always rave to my friends and relatives about this fine little gem of a store. All I can say is do yourself a favor and check them out . The staff goes above and beyond with customer service and they really do help people out in a pinch with the most fare loans payed anywhere.<//review>

Mid Valley Pawn in Turlock is my go to place for collectibles. They are honest, fair and just good people. I've only purchased from them but have been in when people are looking to sell or get a loan. They made very reasonable offers each time. I've heard people say on more than 1 occasion, "That is way more than the other place offered". The store is clean, well lit & has a great selection. I highly recommend these guys. Go check them out!<//Text>

Do not go here!!  I pawned a ring and when I got it back, it was obviously nicked.  For sure the nick was not there when I gave it to them because I inspected it before I pawned it.  I should have known better than to bring a beautiful ring to hateful classless strangers.  The young guy (I don’t think he’s the owner) who took it must be hating that I had such a nice ring, something that he couldn’t afford maybe.  What a sick jerk!   Do not leave your valuables here, folks!   Don’t even let them touch your jewelry unless you don’t value them.  The classless rude employee should be fired.</Text>

For the first time ever, I decided to sell a few items at a pawnshop.  I chose Mid Valley based on their outstanding reviews.  Now that I have first hand experience, I am happy to give my own review.  The staff is professional, courteous and helpful.
Because I ended up selling a few items from straight forward to rare, valuable, and quirky, it was crystal clear they are genuinely fair and down to Earth people and a truly honest business.
Thank you Mid Valley !</text>

This place was great time they took care of my needs and we're friendly through the whole process. I recommend this place over other pawn shops in the area. I would drive from Modesto to here rather than using closer places to you. I promise they r worth the drive.<//review>

<review>Purchased a high performance gaming laptop from this team. More than a fair price and the customer service was steller. They went out of their way to help me find the gear I was looking for and they were accommodating in working with me to make the sale. Couldn’t be more pleased and will continue doing business with them in the future.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Highly recommended!  I was very hesitant about walking into a pawn shop for the first time. I can say that both guys I have dealt with (family owned) have made me feel very welcome,  and offered me a fair price on my items both times I needed a loan. While I was in the last time, I ended up getting a great deal on some tools and bracelet.  Lots of cool stuff to buy at this shop.< /Review>

<Review>Josh and his staff will treat you with up most respect. You can count on Mid Valley Pawn to help you in your time of need. My husband is dealing with Prostate Cancer, and Josh helped us a little more, by purchasing some items from us when he really didn’t need the items. I absolutely recommend everyone to stop by and see all the great items they have for sale. You truly won’t be disappointed. Thank you Josh and staff for helping us one more time. We will definitely be back. Cj and Shawn B.< /Review>< user_id>

Everyone was very friendly! I went in just needing a short term loan and was very satisfied with the service I received. Employees are very down to earth and made me feel very comfortable. The person I was dealing with was awesome and very professional. I'd definitely recommend this business to friends/family and will be the first place I go if I ever need another loan in the future!< /text>

My buddy Lewis needed some extra cash for the winter break so we brought practically everything that he had that was worth something down to mid valley pawn. The guys there were respectable and fair. I would recommend this place to anyone who is in need of some cash and are looking for a fair cash swap.<//text>

Just got a GORGEOUS white gold, diamond engagement ring and wedding band from there. Customer service? AMAZING. Now let me tell you about prices. my fiance and I searched several local jewelry stores and were almost persuaded to buy a couple thousand ring when we decided to check out this pawn shop and needless to say, i found the ring of my dreams! We got an out of this world deal for my perfect ring. I even spent some time just checkin out the store and having good conversation with the employees. I recommend Mid Valley Pawn to ANYONE and EVERYONE's jewelry needs. (Plus got a great deal on resizing my ring!) they have a huuuge selection and much, much more than jewelry. So on a Saturday or any day off, go check this store out. It will definately be worth your while. Thanks Mid Valley Pawn!< /Text>

He was obviously mad he didnt get it at the price he wanted, i see most good reviews come from "white people" which is okay, i get it, give a fair price to the people you choose, but you will get caller out on it.

Highly recommend! Josh and Zack are so easy going and make everything so simple! I sold 2 Michael Kors bags and a Louis Vuitton clutch. I did not have a box or receipt for my Louis Vuitton since it was about a year or so old but they were able to clearly see the authenticity. Gave me a good price for all 3 items and they were fun to chat with too. Thanks guys!</review>

< Review>
I haven't needed a pawn shop many times so when I do I usually feel uncomfortable, and a little leary of dealing with them. I went to Mid Valley Pawn today in need of a small loan. I was treated with respect and exseptional customer service. I recommend the pawn shop if your in need of a loan or just shopping for a good and fair deal. Cuddo's to them for a wonderful experience.
I'll defiantly be back.

Many thanks,
Angelika< /Review>

We pawn, buy and sell newer smartphones frequently.\nCome on down and see what we have in the shop, and if it was on our end we certainly apologize.\nTry us by phone again or better yet come in and see us in person ..\nAs the majority of the reviews here on Google and the rest of the web say we are pretty chill and reasonable guys. Let us make you a fan too.'}< /Resp>
<text>As soon as they answered the phone a man said hello loudly twice because I guess I took too long to say good morning. Garbage customer service they shouldn't have people working if they have a ungly attitude< /text>< Name>

<Review>Wow fake reviews, they will only loan 20% of the items value, the best in Turlock because it's the only.  Other shops will do 50% of value maybe even better,  why would you come here.  buy prices are also higher then online prices. I don't see this place in business for long, you can't rob the seller and the buyer.  Not a good place to pawn or buy,  They want to pay 20% of value and sell for full price, you are better off going to atwater pawn or ebay to buy.  I'm probably the only person to go to Vegas and skip the casinos and try to hit all the pawn shops, I know my pricing well.  for a macbook pro worth $1700 on ebay they will try to give you $400 everybody else would give you atleast $750 - 900</Review>< pictures>

{'time': 1498154066538, 'text': "Hey Devin,\nThanks for visiting our shop!\n\nYou're absolutely right we are the only pawn shop in Turlock, and still pretty new.\nWe are reminded daily as new faces come through our door that people are still just learning we're here, and thats great because we plan to be around for a long time.\nSo far the Turlock and valley community has welcomed us enthusiastically and with open arms.\nA quick read through of the other reviews here on Google show people describe us as fair,  pretty down to earth and always up for making a deal!\nThese are honest and accurate reviews. So allow us to respond to the concerns in your review.\n\nWe use many online resources when setting our prices to make absolutely sure that we have the best prices around! We encourage people to bring cash and make an offer. No prices are set in stone so if you really did see something in our shop that was priced higher than online it's better to just bring it to our attention and make an offer.\n\nWe also know that the flip side of bringing an item in to sell or get a loan on can be a little vexatious for both customers and our staff as we go through the negotiation process.\nFirst and foremost customers can always expect us to be transparent and honest in our assessment of items and in our business practice.\nThat said sometimes with certain items we have a level of comfort and expertise as to what we are willing to invest and risk on particular items. These are challenging business decisions with a delicate balance between being fair and just and making sure that we can keep our business growing to help more members of the community.\n\nCertainly there are less expeditious ways to sell your items that may yield a more profitable transaction such as selling your items directly to another consumer who intends to use it themselves.\nIt's important to understand we are not consumers, we are brokers with cash on hand to make an immediate purchase on items for the opportunity to resell for a profit ourselves.\nOften people don't want to do the additional legwork or take the time to find another consumer so it's an easier faster process to sell it to a pawnshop.\n\nThis response is getting long but we do want to speak to your last point regarding percentages on loans. While your review doesn't speak to the item you attempted to get a loan on and since we do our best to maintain customer confidentially I will just speak in broad terms.\nWe loan on array of items, jewlery, musical instruments, coins, collectibles, tools, and even some electronics if they're in fantastic shape and still moderately new.\nCertain items like jewlery and collectibles typically maintain their value for a much longer period of time and are easily resold compared to electronics and inexpensive musical instruments which begin to depreciate immediately after their purchase at a retail store.\nIn California loans are good for 130 days. that's over four (4) months an item is just sitting in a pawnbrokers storage room depreciating. That said all pawnbrokers write loans on a sliding scale percentage based on the merits of the  item. I.e. type, condition, performance, upgrades, length of life, and perceived depreciation. We certainly take a look at customers who have established a solid reputation and rapport with us as well to try to help our customers meet their needs but in the end it's only an offer that one must agree to. Sometimes negotiations don't work out and we hope to shake hands and make a deal on a different item next time.\n\nI hope this clears things up for you and you will reconsider visiting our store with your newly furnished knowledge of how our pawn shop operates.\nIf not at least give us a wave as you drive by to your next review of a fast food joint or cheap motel."}<//Response>

Decided to come for lunch.  Food was delicious and fresh.  Service was quick, friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed a milk tea boba drink with our food.  My husband got a noodle dish and I got a rice bowl dish called bibimbap.  We also got some delicious desserts to go.  I would like to come back and try some of their other desserts.  I just wish the parking was better here.  We found a parking spot easily this visit but sometimes it's hard to find a spot.  Plus all spaces are tiny.< /Text>

<Review>I love the desserts here! But the lady there was not much help I asked her about this dessert and wats it like when it's hot and she kept saying "Americans like it cold Hong Kong ppl like it hot" I mean okay. What does it taste like is it like carnation milky or shaved ice cream? I dnt wanna hear about how the Americans like it just the taste of the dessert I give this place a 4 because of the fact that she kept sayings "THE AMERICANS" she's in america right? But hey the food here is great!! So must try guys!! Probley will get a better first time experience T_^ #lmao #yummy #omgosh #AMERICANS<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809ad1c95fa38117:0x824a4a1780537d03<//GmapID></record>

<text>4/5 for the flower pot tiramisu: a unique take on the trend of potted plant boba. It comes with a shovel spoon and a cute little pot. I tried the green tea and a bit of the classic tiramisu and both had good flavor and were also nice and fluffy. The Oreo was a good complement and finely crushed. It is a pretty small dessert.

On the other hand, the other dessert and boba I tried weren't that great. I tried a normal milk tea with crystal boba and the tea was just ok, a little too much milk in proportion. The boba was too chewy and not that tasty. I also tried the lychee jasmine milk tea pudding and it was disappointing. For one it seems reasonable to assume that you can take the jar home but it costs an additional $.50. They should have put that on the menu at least. The jelly wasn't that good, although the pudding was delicious. It was a split dessert.

I'd only suggest getting the tiramisu pot here.< /text><rate>3< /rate><Name>Steven Vong< /Name><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The food is mediocre. And it's very expensive for what you getting. I wouldn't come back here personally again.< /review>

<Text>Panera in Beverly Hills is the same as Panera out in B.F.E. Oregon, and that's a good thing.  Need some food you are familiar with, something you know will sit well with you while walking around seeing the sites?  Hit up Panera.  The staff was friendly and the food was normal.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2bbfbf2b831fd:0x55b0817074ab6940< /gmap_id>< user>

It's got a big dining room in the back and is support affordable for the area. It can be pretty cold, so I'd suggest bringing a jacket or sweater.</review>

I ordered ahead and my meal was not ready. Generally not a problem, but parking is crazy on the street so it's a real pain. When I got back to my office to eat, the bread was so burnt I could only eat the sandwich without bread, which is not a sandwich at all. I contacted corporate offices with a complaint and never heard back.</text>

I like to get the half mac n cheese, half green goddess cobb usually. It's so good! The breakfast sandwiches are also yummy! The drinks are yummy, too! Everything is yummy! Also, they have free WiFi, which I take advantage of to do work as well as to play pokemon go....<//Text>

Terrible. Came here for breakfast with my girlfriend. Her food was handed to her instantly while my food was prepared. She was finished eating by the time my food was finally ready.

When I asked for a pastry to be heated, I was directed to a microwave which was on the floor.

Edit: last time I went back, they didn't have any soufflés and didn't plan to at all that day. What a lousy place to eat.<//Review>

<resp>None< /resp><text>COOLEST Panera Bread store I've ever experienced! I walked in and immediately fell in love with the space. It's got a warm industrial-modern feel with high ceilings, rustic wood tables and exposed brick walls. I'm so excited that we now have a store in Beverly Hills. The Hot Turkey Panini w/ a cup of Tomato soup is my all-time favorite. Today I tried the LENTIL QUINOA BOWL WITH CHICKEN and it was DELICIOUS. It had fresh kale and spinach, quinoa and lentils, antibiotic-free chicken, all in a flavorful soy-miso broth. You have to try it!!!

Overall: There is such a unique vibe in the store that I've never experienced at any other Panera. Plus, the food is incredible. There's free wifi, staff is attentive yet knows when to leave you alone. I see it as a great working space to go/hang out on the computer writing and relaxing.

Loved it. Proud to be the first to share this awesome cafe with everyone on Yelp. So glad I finally have a Panera in Beverly Hills, Beverly blvd is now complete!< /text>< Time>

Extremely disappointed. I ordered the chicken panini and what they brought me was very sad looking. Looked and tasted like canned chicken that was drowned in cheese.<//Review>

Poor service. Had to literally ask someone if I could place my order (she was standing there not doing anything either). Then they changed my favorite salad (Asian Chicken) with an awful replacement. Why???< /Text>

(Translated by Google) We enjoyed a very tasty fresh salad (strawberry and something ...). Price-performance ratio just great. When I think of the salad, my mouth is watering. If you want healthy, fresh food quickly, Panera Bread is in very good hands!

I went to the subway rather meet in the evening and the food was just not taste good at all nor did it taste fresh. The meat that I received for my sandwich had Gristle in the meat I thought it was roast beef but apparently it was not That along with another sandwich tuna sandwich it was OK but the soup was not fresh either and we were the last ones to get the end of the suit so I am done I am not gonna go to the subway anymore< /text>

<review>Me & my husband went to subway on 03/05 Friday , located on woodman & Nordhoff in arleta calif. The Indian lady was so rude.  Ordered 2 sandwiches & gave her the coupons,  she said they had already been used & took them away from us. Made me very upset.  We left & left the sandwiches as well. I will never go back to that subway.  We went to the subway on Roscoe & van nuys Blvd.  Excellent service. Leslie, has great customer service 👏  she even let me sample the vinegrett,  unlike that Indian lady.  So I highly don't recommend subway on woodman & nordhoff st. In Aleta.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c290d80b9d9169:0xd4d684b916a2ad6f<//gmap_id></record>

This is the most ridiculous, incompetent place ever. I come in to purchase a veggie wrap with a veggie patty. Well, the lady refused to make me one. Her excuse was, their veggie wraps are sold with regular meat only. It is the most stupid excuse ever. It says on the menu " customize your own wrap." I had to drive to a different location when this one is only 1minute away from me. Never going there again! 😡 And the only reason I gave them  one star is to leave a comment, otherwise they don't even deserve that.</review>

I came in at 9:42 on a Saturday I had a bad day and I couldn't eat inside since they close at 10:00 and they had about 6-8 customers eating inside the two females spoke in some Arabic language gave me a bit attitude this never happened to me at any other subway location and it sucks when I can't eat in after a bad day which I almost lost it.  I will never recommend this location and the food was so so<//text>

< Review>
So on Sunday October 14 around 5pm I walked into this subway I get greeted since I have lost my voice I show the lady my phone to read my order she then  proceeds to snatch my phone away from my hand and placed it   Where they prepare the sandwiches as she was reading my order from my phone I felt hopeless as I couldn’t talk and tell her how  unsanitary &  disgusting it was that she placed my phone and literally slide it as she was making my sandwich I just  made a sign for her to give my phone back to me she handed me my phone I walked out of there never to return what she did was  extremely unsanitary!<//Review>

Subway always meets the need for a reasonably priced sub that won't make you cheat on your diet.  4 stars because nothing beats Brent's in Northridge.< /review>

<Review>I went and bought a set of used tires. The one on my driverside was rotten and broke apart while on the freeway. I went back to get a new tire and said hes not going to do anything about it. How is it legal to swll dry rotted tires. Ive been going here for awhile. They also lost my valve cap to my tires. I bought a set online and 2 went missing. So be careful they sell bad products, take your stuff and sell dangerous tires. 1 start is giving them too much. In my opinion.< /Review>< pics>

negative experience, when I pointed out to the technician tha one of the tires  the mounted was mounted backwards, and needs remounting, I got a hostile response , lost my original stem caps so I left with 4 different stem caps, what a guy, made me feel like I did something wrong,, the service was for mounting/ balancing  of 4 new tires, for $100.</Text>

I bought two 205/70/15R tires and they were great. Affordable, quality tires and excellent service and the best part - it only took them 15 minutes. I went to Big-O first and they told me that I’d have to wait for 3 hours but the guys at Eagle Tires had me to work on time.</Review>

<Text>I like doing business with honest people and honest businesses.

I didn't like doing business here. I called ahead and asked how much it would be to patch a tire. They told me $20 on the phone.

When I walked in, one of their workers told me it was $30. I told him that I was previously informed it was $20. He said "I think you want to give me $30". I don't appreciate heavy handed business tactics or veiled threats, I couldn't tell which this was.

Either way, I paid $20. The only reason I went here was because Les Schwab was closed. It was out of desperation, this is the only reason I would ever come here again. Hopefully I never have to.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<user_id>112242227826703678187<//user_id><rate>4</rate><resp>None</resp><Text>Place looks sketchy with a capital S, but they did it. Swapped four new tires on while I waited (albeit sitting on the curb), for half the price and twice as fast as a normal shop. Just did it right outside with a jack; I don't think they have a normal lift inside. The guy didn't torque the lug nuts at all, he just used an impact gun, and didn't even tighten them in a star pattern, just in a circle. I'll have to loosen and retighten properly (safely) them at home, but that's tolerable. I'm recommending them because they installed my tires (which are T rated when my car calls for Z rated, even though it's still safe) when no one else would because of some vague liability.

These guys don't care about liability. If it's black and round and you want it, it goes on the car. Quick and cheap, but don't expect perfection or a comfy waiting room.</Text></record></dataset><record>

So I tried calling first no answer, i showed up instead because of previous buisness done with them. I was greeted by a gentleman and was told $45 for 1 used tire, so I agreed and proceeded to allow the work, I was then asked by another guy what i needed to be done and i told him, and then asked can he do a deal for 2 tires? He then tells me $50 each and I said that 1st guy told me $45, he said "oh no hes the new guy it's $50 each" and then a 3rd "tough guy" jumps in asking about the other tire I was inquiring about that was a spare moving torwards my trunk pushing to start working and get involved with my car, not to mention they're starting to talk over each other, so I just told the  1st guy to drop my car and that they're not working on my car, so here I am at solano tires on sonoma don't know the mangers name yet but if you want straight business go to solano tires on sonoma, it's a shame because I used to get all my tires done at eagles tires and used to send them business while working in the mechanic shop down the street, but it's ok won't be going there ever again< /text>

After a flat she went to them asking for her 4 used tires to be replaced they sold her 2 leaky tires and stole her barely used spare tire and damaged her front end. When she went back and explained this to them she was met with nothing but disregard and disrespect. Only getting anything done by them after being unable to leave because the tire they sold her was flat and not having the spare tire they took from her to replace it with.

Went there hoping they will replace it as warranty since it hardly even 10K miles on it.They say there is not warranty because I paid discounted price and not full price....its faulty tires, or should I say they sell cheap tire..never going back.< /review>< username>

Okay doing business prior to the last time, but asked for 2 used front tires, the worker asked if the Michelins were okay, owner said yes.
WRONG!
Within a weeks time and hardly driving at all but to work, 1 1/2 miles a day, I noticed hitting a small pothole my wheels were slamming in to them, and the air pressure showed leaking from them,  I went back on day 8, the same worker was extremely rude so went to the owner and explained these tires are the wrong size and what was happening.
He would not swap them for the correct size at all, I even said I'd be okay with crediting half the cost towards the right tires, nope, he said I'd have to pay for the next pair full price.....
I was stuck with these tires and today, several months later and damaged rims and badly needing my front end aligned, I am headed to replace these tires that, as it turned out are old and disintegrated terribly.

Low profile tires don't work on a Cadillac.....
Eagle tires it's clear that it's all about the sale, poor business ethics.
Never again.<//Text>

<review>Stopped to get gas and noticed this hole in the wall, so I decided to stop and get a breakfast burrito with bacon. I was pleasantly surprised, bacon was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I'll be back!<//review>< Pics>

It's okay. Sometimes it's better and sometimes not so much. Stick with burritos and the taco salad.< /text>

The food is decent. A little disappointed that they raised the prices on their meals during the covid crisis. I walked in and mentioned that he asked for more money than the menu had suggested for a meal. I was told the prices are "different right now".
Perhaps update your website to reflect the change?< /review>

This place is good - they have gotten our order wrong a few times so that is why the 3 stars. Otherwise - really good tacos</text>

We eat here often, commonly getting take out. Friendly people. Fast service, good food, decent prices.  If you are in a hurry and want a good (big) burrito, try the chicken fajita burrito.  Good stuff and more than a meal in itself, and you can eat it in the road if you are in a time crunch.   Nice!< /text>

<Review>Best Mexican food in the area, but really the only Mexican food in the area. The food is authentic and decent quality but nothing to rave about. The prices are a bit high but again...

We eat at El Agave Taqueria quite frequently. The business is family-owned, and they are wonderful and charming people. The food is excellent, and is definitely the best Mexican food choice in the area. Even if you are in the Grass Valley or Nevada City area, make the drive to El Agave Taqueria. You will not be disappointed. P.S... try the El Agave tacos!</Text>

<Review>This just happened a few minutes ago.  I walked in to buy some tamales.  They are about 18.00 a dozen and there is a sign on the cash register that says so.  I said i will take a dozen.  The young man walks back go get them and says there are only 6.  Ok i will take the 6.  The high school girl behind the counter says that will be 18.00.  I said that can't be right as it is 12 for 18.00 and I am only getting 6. She says it is only 18.00 if you buy 12, as she looks at me and points to the special sign on the counter.  I tried to explain the complicated math involved in figuring out the correct amount only to be glared at and again told it is only a special if I buy 12 of which they do not have.  I told her I will take it up with the owner as they have several restaurant.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

After living in San Diego for six years I have developed a taste for the mom and pop taquerias, however, the Grass Valley area did not have anything close. Until, that is, El Agave came along! This is in my opinion our most authentic typical Mexico style restaurant in the area. If you like it spicy try the Diabla sauce it's a sweet and spicy delicacy.</text>

<text>Mexican food in a limited food option area. One star for the location, so if you don't want fried chicken or Starbucks, you have options. One star for the menu, which is pretty 'taqueria' typical. $8 and change for a breakfast burrito the size of my forearm earns a third star. The staff is there and does their job and they do not have events, entertainment or much else besides the decor and typical Mexican tunes coming out of the speakers. An outside dining area is also available if you grabbed a coffee next door and have a few minutes to waste. All in all, I go here often and recommend it. The place is about food, not thrills or 'the experience'.<//text><user>100402794727297713536<//user>< Rate>

This is the only Taqueria we have found that compares to our Taqueria in Santa Rosa.  When I told my son about it we had to try it out.< /Review>

<Review>The service is not great. The waitresses are very young and inexperienced. I was not greeted when I approached the register and sat there awkwardly for about ten minutes, waiting for service. During this time, three of the wait staff wandered around past me several times without acknowledging that I had walked in... Their nachos are good, though.</Review>< response>

<Text>So coming from work and about 10minutes away from the restaurant, I decided to call my order in ahead of time. After 45 seconds of dial tone, someone picks up and asks me to hold. I replied okay and he set the phone done but not on hold (I could hear everything thing in the back ground).

As I'm driving to the restaurant, I hear communication in the back ground, and then a few orders being taken. Patiently waiting for my turn, I hear a few employee talking in the back ground (mistake 1). I finally arrive at the restaurant and park, still on hold, and enter the restaurant. I wait my turn in line, and wait for the cashier to finish. I approached the cashier, which is the man who put me on hold, and he just asks me (here or to go) not making eye contact or remotely caring that I'm trying to have a good conversation. I said "here, I am the guy that's been on hold for about 8:30 minutes."

He corrects me to say it's only been 7:30 minutes... I ask if I could have a carne asada super nacho and he tells me they were out of asada. I then walk out the door with utter loss for words over the incident that had just occurred.

Not only was the cashier very rude and put the phone down while I was on the line to hear all the opportunities that he could have taken my order, he also corrected me on how long I was on hold, and the fact that they were out of what they should be serving.

They lost my buisness and it will be a long time before I think about going back to this restaurant....< /Text>< pics>

I can't rate their food because I can't eat what they gave me. But I can rate my experience.

I'm on a low carb diet, so I ordered a bowl w/chicken, cheese, lettuce, and sour cream to go. The guy taking my order offered guac, so I got that too.

Unfortunately, I ended up with a high-carb burrito with a ton of rice & beans and no guac. I didn't notice this until I got home and ended up just giving the burrito to someone who wasn't on a diet. Honestly, I know I should've gone back, but it was a long ride home and a long, tiring day at work.

I'll say that the food looks delicious and give them a benefit of a doubt. My friend enjoyed the tacos they got and I'm sure they'll enjoy the burrito as well. I'll try going back in another time, but I'm hoping to get the right order so I can give a higher rating.</text>

They need to pay attention to people when they're placing their orders. Got my order wrong again, how can you confuse a jelly doughnut with a classic doughnut tell me.</Text>

This is my go-to place as far as Donuts, if you want a donut where you don't taste the grease this is your place. And I know Starbucks is across the street but don't sleep on their coffee just as strong. Love there Ice coffee. The English language is not strong here so just point to your Donuts....lol<//Text>

Great service. Friendly staff. Great prices.  Have been bringing my dog here since she was 8 weeks old, from getting her vaccines to surgery, she's not a fan, always a workout for them, but they always treat her. They don't judge.<//text>

Please stay away! Vet was unprofessional and condescending; offered me unsolicited advice on how to positive reinforcement my new dog for vet visits, which is not new for me; wrote a prescription for a spray that was not necessary nor did he talked about in the treatment room. Front desk receptionist was very rude and angry, not helpful. She was annoyed and angry that my dog was barking at another dog and told me to leave her in the car, which I did. I paid and came back to my car and found out my dog had pooped inside. Dealing with receptionist was a really painful experience and she should not be working with customers with that attitude and telling customers to put their dogs inside cars when she can't work with that much noise and normal vet offices. I have told all my friends not to go to this horrible place.< /Review>

First time here after our regular veterinarian office couldn't see our pet until 2nd week of January for a situation we were not sure was an emergency but wanted to get her in right away. Shirley got me an appointment first thing the next morning and we will be making this our new veterinarian clinic for both kitties. The whole staff was amazing and for a first time visit and medication was very well priced.<//text>

<Text>Top-notch vet and staff providing a superlative level of service!
My organization helps people access reasonably priced medical care for their pets, and Dr. Naqvi has soothed a giant American bulldog's skin allergies and drawn blood from a 17 year old kitty so gently that the kitty was still his friend afterward. If cats could do Google reviews, this senior boy would give five stars - or would that be five mackerels? ;)

The staff works tremendously hard to ensure the best quality of service for all, and they take every precaution to keep COVID-19 at bay! From vet tech to front desk, each person at this practice works from the best possible place - their hearts! to keep furry family members feeling good.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I genuinely appreciate ALL the Staff working at E.C.P.H.
The Doctor is Amazingly knowledgeable, helpful, and nice 👌.
I will always bring my fur family to be taken care of by the E.C.P.H.Staff because they will accommodate you EVEN during your appointment mix up 🤪.
I also LOVE the fact the staff does not bend, or flex the rules for Covid. They will make sure that your fur baby is protected as well!!</text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>The doctor we saw was very unprofessional and rude to me and my dog. We had seen this doctor several times before and he knows that you need to use a muzzle with him because he gets very nervous and agitated when he gets examined, before putting on the mussel he proceeded to grab my dog from behind on the back of the neck! He claimed my dog almost bit him when he did not and tried to tell me how to handle my dog! From now on I will go back to my previous veterinarians office.The only reason I went to this vet  in the first place was because where I adopted my dog from, the vet was on the list for a free exam . Do not go to this vet the doctor is very rude! When I initially made my appointment I was hung up on!</text>< pictures>

Such great quality care here. i’ve taken 3 cats and 2 rescue dogs and a litter of street kittens and they have proven to be very affordable and kind every visit. I always make sure to recommend them to those of us that can’t afford 500$+ every visit and they are so efficient once the animals are seen. Thanks guys keep up the great work!< /review>

Was not very thrilled with my experience there. The front desk gave the vet the wrong information about my pet when I literally just told her what was wrong with them. So she clearly wasn't listening or she just didn't care. and don't even get me started on the fact that they still use mercury thermometers when they had a digital right there. I don't know about your pets but mine doesn't like caffeine shoved up his but especially for long periods of time. And run the risk of it breaking and putting poison into my animal's body. I was told the vet didn't believe in digital thermometers then I said but they exist. I paid them $60 to make my dog uncomfortable and then tell me they couldn't help me because they didn't know what was wrong. And didn't want to even try anything other then just looking at him. No tests or labs. Nothing but a bill and a couple of hours wasted. I would take your pet anywhere else. then they continue to call me to check up on the dog that they had no idea what was wrong with and I had to go to another vet to get the diagnosis.< /Text>

We went back to them several nice they were so great with our other dog. We  Loco 2yrs old dog  to have his Dew Claws removed, he had 2 on each back leg that were attached to the bone, they removed them all, neutered and gave him  a shot that was due. They were very reasonable priced and was great with Loco. I can not imagine going to another Vet and getting the same great  treatment. Would recommend this Vet to anyone that wants great  care for their pet.</Text>

There's a reason why this Vet has the lowest reviews in the area.  Go to the two others within walking distance.  I was looking for a new vet since my old one retired - had an appointment for a simple health certificate that they couldn't keep because they mis-booked and don't know what they're doing!  This is the Bay Area - don't you know anything about lifetime customer value?</Text>

<Text>I will NEVER take my fur-baby here again. This place failed to properly diagnose my pup. The doctor focused more about raising her than actually paying attention to what was wrong and gave her medicine she didnt need. I took her to banfield, which is wonderful, and they properly diagnosed her, gave her exactly what she needed, and were most helpful!

PLEASE NOTE:
I had come here with the person I got the pup from, lets say "Emily", who had given a negative review. I was so-so with the service, would have given 3 stars. BUT, the doctor had his front desk, and himself, harass me to give them a high star rating AND talk to "Emily" to get her to raise her stars too! That is completely uncalled for and unprofessional!<//Text>< Rating>

<Text>We have been coming to this pet hospital with Dr. Naqvi for the last 11 years. We’ve brought animals in from strays, to loved family pets. Dr. Naqvi is a straight forward, highly intelligent veterinarian who has worked tirelessly to help us with our animals. He often makes us feel like his only patients, through his genuine care and love for our pets. He always listens to everything we have to say whether it’s a concern or a theory we have about what may be going on. He has been extremely exceptional with my 20 year old cat who has kidney failure and gastrointestinal issues. He has supported us every step of the way, through good times and bad. I 100% trust his opinion, and love that he is willing to admit when something isn’t working. He doesn’t sugarcoat and tells you exactly what is going on with your animals and proper ways to go about fixing it. Between him and his amazing staff, we get phone calls checking in on our animals after visits regularly. If you are looking for a place to take your animals, especially for intense care, this is the place to go!<//Text>< name>

<rate>1</rate><text>DO NOT GO HERE!! Do not board your pets here. They have no idea what they are doing, and are very cruel to their boarded animals. I boarded my dog there for 12 days and they only took my dog outside one time. ONE TIME. I called to check in to see how my dog was while I was away, and they told me he was doing great. When I went to pick up my dog, I saw that they had just let sit in his own poop and pee for days. Their excuse for doing this was that he almost nipped the sweatshirt of the employee. Part of their job is to know how to handle dogs. WORST PLACE EVER. Go to Metro Pets down the street.< /text>< pictures>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Front desk was very polite and helpful- however, that ‘doctor’ is incredibly rude. As soon as he walked into the examination room, he had an air of arrogance. He starts checking out my cat, and he tells me to “scruff” my cat (hold my cat by the scruff). I told him TWO times that I had never done that before, and that I didn’t know if I could do it. He completely ignored me and told me to do it. I tried my best, but I couldn’t seem to do it right. He was picking my cat up by her hind paws and checking her out, and of course she felt uncomfortable so she swipes at his hand and it leaves a scratch. He gets up immediately, and irritatedly says, “I told you to hold her. I thought you were holding her.” He was so rude, acting like it was my fault. I then said, “I told you I didn’t know how to do that because I’ve never done this before.” ONCE AGAIN, he ignores me and he steps out of the room.
When he came back, he tried to joke around and say “I left to get my hammer.” Damage was done by then. The only reason I stayed was because my poor cat has a fever and we don’t know what to do.
They give my cat injections and prescribe medication.
When my cat returns with the nurse, she immediately puts my cat in the carrier, and tells us there may be fluid in her side but that it would go away in 1-2 hours. We get home, and my cat is bleeding profusely from the injections site. She’s been bleeding since we brought her home, and it’s already the next day. I pray that she’s bleeding because she’s scratched, and that it wasn’t due to negligence from this vet.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Horrible customer service. Call for a new client appt.  Get told by someone 11:45am.  Get put on hold and someone else gets on tells me that appt is taken and go to go somewhere else. I have never heard of hospital going this before.  Lost my business. Didn’t even care about my cat.  Horrible people and service stay away.<//review>

Do not go there, the vet spent 30 min talked about how to train the dog, didn't check the dog completely. No actual diagnostic, just said maybe this, maybe that,  He really didn't know what he was doing. In the end, he didn't tell what his diagnostic was, just gave antibiotic, that's it!<//text>

They said is a little surgery but when I get the call later that day, they said my dog died there and they don't know why! My dog's eye and noise were bleeding when he died! They must do something wrong to my dog! They don't admit but evade. I am so angry with them!

I have been going here for years and have found the care and prices to be very good. I love my dogs and would not take them any place that was not great. I can also just pay vet tech for shots or nail clippings if that is what I need. Great place!</Review>

Excellent doctor. Very knowledgeable and took the time to explain. Our dog became very sick. I found this hospital through a friend of mine.  The doctor did not give undue hope nor scare me into a spending spree. Just gave his straight forward opinion. Dedicated and very competent. We drive 40 miles to visit him and will continue to do so in the future.< /Review>

I couldn’t get in to see my regular vet at Richmond Vet Hospital (❤️), so they recommended I take my cats to El Cerrito Pet Hospital.  My cats are 17 years old and litter mates. They had both lost a lot of weight at the same time, but I only took the thinnest one in at first.

After waiting a VERY long time, Dr. Naqvi came in and was certain of a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and reduced kidney function. He kept my cat overnight to run tests that confirmed his diagnosis, then requested I bring my other cat information the same testing (remember, 17 year old litter mates).

WELL OVER $2,000 LATER, I was sent home with cat #2, outrageously expensive cat food, and a bunch of compounded medications. I was told I needed to contact the office several days before picking up any refills, since it takes a while to make (to combine two ingredients ?!?).

A few weeks later I received a postcard reminding me to bring JUST ONE of my cats in for a 2nd dose of FPV vaccine. WHAT???  Why would the cat need ANY FPV vaccine when he’s SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND INDOOR ONLY???

In the meantime I tried to get a refill of generic medication he prescribed from Chewy, which would cost considerably less than what Naqvi charges. His office refused.

His staff is nice, but he’s a crook.< /text>

<text>Vet assistance staff and front desk staff are very warm and thoughtful. Prices for anesthesia are double the amount of other vets I’ve been to. I was going to be charged $600 to put my dog under anesthesia so he could do X rays.... The vet I usually go to does not need to put my dog under anesthesia for an x-ray, which made me wonder about this doctor’s bedside manner...This doctor almost always needs to redo urine and blood test multiple times and charges You for each time they get an unclear test result....On yelp reviews, it appears that 8 out of 10 pets that have come in for a crisis ended up dying.  The Vets Doctor doesn’t seem to be as warm towards animals as his staff members that assist him.

The Campus Veterinary Clinic in Berkeley has much better reviews and prices...<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I’ve been taking dogs and cats to Dr. Naqvi at El Cerrito Pet Hospital for years. He and his staff are really terrific and very knowledgeable.

One of my dogs had a food allergy which gave him awful skin problems. Dr. Naqvi showed me how to find exactly what the allergy was by testing Hugo’s reaction to a single food at a time. He also gave me medicine that knocked out his flare-up really quickly. Within a month, we’d figured out what his allergy was, so his skin is generally in great shape. I have accidentally given him wheat since then and caused another bad flare up. Dr. Naqvi gave me a spray and a prescription that stopped the flare up in a couple of days, and kept Hugo comfortable while the itchy redness was going away.

He knows his stuff. I have tested this out. One time he told me that my friend’s dog was coughing primarily due to her just being really fat. I thought there had to be something else going on. So I took her to a different veterinarian, and they examined her, did blood tests, and even took x-rays because I wanted them to be as thorough as possible. Their diagnosis? Her weight was the reason for the terrible cough.

Aside from being really good at treating animals, El Cerrito Pet is even more excellent in the warm heart area. You can see it in how everyone engages with the animals being brought to them for care, and also in how they take care of the humans who bring them in.

My friends is disabled, and can’t get to the vet without a ride for her and for her wheelchair. I was amazed when I visited her about a year ago and she told me that she didn’t need me to take her to the vet. Shirley, who runs the front desk, had realized that it was a hassle for her to get there, and had been taking her animals back and forth and also bringing their prescriptions to my friend.

When my friend was in the ICU and desperately ill, each time I would stop by for a free weigh-in for the old, overweight dog (who became normal-sized and spunky by following Dr. Naqvi’s program of weight loss for her), Dr. Naqvi and all the staff wanted to know how my friend was doing, and asked me to pass on their good wishes for a speedy and full recovery. I know that they prayed for her, too, especially Dr. Naqvi, who is a spiritual man.

I highly recommend El Cerrito Pet Hospital. Dr. Naqvi and his staff are talented and knowledgeable people, and their hearts are wide open for us and for our pets.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We brought our beloved family dog in for what we thought was a cut in his mouth that actually turned out to be a serious auto-immune condition that required a blood transfusion and a 5 night vet stay.  Shortly into the initial appointment, it became clear that something was seriously wrong with our dog and very quickly and methodically, Dr. Naqvi began to rule out various causes.  Throughout the entire process, both he and his staff were extremely practical and realistic, keeping us informed about our choices and about cost.  During his 5 night stay, I received regular phone updates from Dr. Naqvi, as well as his staff who cared for our dog.  He encouraged us to visit our dog whenever we wanted!  On a Sunday morning, I received a call from a staff member who cared for the pet patients over the weekend, just to tell me he received his treatments that day, ate well, and was wagging his tail.  Even after our dog came home, I received calls from Dr. Naqvi and his staff, checking in on him.

While we were able to bring our dog home and his outlook is very good, about a year and a half ago, we had a cat who become very ill, very quickly.  We received the same level of compassion and practicality which ultimately led to a very different outcome for our cat.  At the time, Dr. Naqvi explained what needed to be done to attempt to save our cat, but even still, there were no guarantees for her.  We ended up putting her down.

We are truly grateful for Dr. Naqvi and his entire staff – from the vet technicians, to the caregivers, to the front desk folks – for their patience and their compassion, most recently with our dog, and with our cat previously.  Our pets will be life-long patients at El Cerrito Pet Hospital.<//Text>

<review>Dr. Naqvi is so good! I can't thank this hospital enough for how wonderful they've been. I go to Abbey Pet a lot and see Dr Judd and Dr Schlegel, but also go here if the other clinic doesn't have an opening. Dr. Navqi is one of the best and I feel lucky to have such wonderful vets in my area. To all the people complaining about prices, you need to realize that Vet clinics have a big over head with a lot of staff to pay, rent, supplies, the doctors, and so on. I am a financial analyst and I know how much money it takes to run a business. They are not trying to rip you off. Their prices are more than fair and what they charge is for covering expenses. people have to live and if they did everything at cost, the doctors wouldn't have any money to live. Vets do not make a lot of money, so please stop complaining about the price. If you don't like to pay vet bills, then don't own a pet. This is a good clinic. Would recommend< /review>< GmapID>

Best Vet in our area, Shirley and the staff are great, always go the extra mile for us, Dr Naqvi has taken care of our dogs last 15years. They always try to work with you financially!< /Text>

< Review>
I had appointment at 3:30 for my dog because she had a swollen eye to make a long story short the way that doctor Naqvi talks to you is very  condescending he cuts the rolls his eyes up why you’re trying to talk to him and it’s the attitude like he doesn’t have time for you. He asked me what kind of food I fed my dogs and I said I cook them fresh chicken with peas and carrots and I put it on top of dry food which is blue brand and he told me well if you don’t care what you’re feeding your dogs I don’t care either what kind response is this a vet you had just met for the first time. He says little things to make you feel like you should feel guilty or bad  taking care of your pet he did a good eye exam with my dog but a little bit on the Roughside I supposed to do a follow up appointment with him on Monday by the way I’m canceling at three I’m going to go to my vet that has an opening on Monday the staff is great I’ve only usually went there for boarding at shots but I thought hey you know I’ll try it out to see if I how the doctor was well I’m never going back there again so if you want to go to a place where you feel belittled By the doctor not the staff in my opinion this is the place to go</Review>

Worst experience ever. Brought my dog in thinking he had a lodge bone in his teeth. The doc gave me a $1000 quote and told me it would take a few hours. 6 hours later I showed up and he has been done for 4 hours. The lady tells me that there wasn't a bone and it was just an inflame jaw but since it was under budget so the proceed to draw blood and do these other things.</review>

What a tremendous first visit to ECPH! Thank you to Dr Syed Naqvi and administrative assistants Shirley and Lauren. Our two recently adopted cats even had a great visit, didn't seem to want to leave after their weigh-in and check-up. I am impressed by the professional courtesy of the staff and the knowledge of the veterinarian, especially today on tooth development and care. This business cares about its community, as evidenced by the public service announcements and information abundantly available in the waiting areas - one side accessed from the corner entrance for dogs and one on the Wall Street side for cats, so you know! Shirley knew a lot about the neighboring businesses and showed she is a caring neighbor. Dr Naqvi is a warm and genuine person, and really has great care for the animals who I witnessed come into El Cerrito Pet Hospital. I am sure if there is ever an emergency care situation the doctor and staff here will provide A+ care based on the dedication shown today. Best wishes to pets in our community and thanks, again, to the good people at El Cerrito Pet Hospital.</Text>

<review>This is one of the best parks in Palm springs that I have taken my family to. It is not swamped with homeless people or covered in graffiti. There is wide sprawling fields of green a very well cared for playground and it's honestly just beautiful. I meant picnic tables were very nice and they're in the shade. The sprinklers were on when we were there and my children loved running through them and it was just warm enough to be able to be dry by the time we left. I would say that this park is amazing and definitely worth taking your children too it feels very safe and is located next to an elementary school.< /review>< Pictures>

Love to take my family to this park. Most beautiful views in palm springs  for sure. Great vibes. Only gave 4 stars instead of 5 bc there are some creeps that come around every once awhile and after dark it seems to be a hook up area so beware of the tables in the back by playground after sun goes down.< /Review>

<Text>I like to visit this park with my family & dogs when we visit Palm Springs.  Its conveniently located close to downtown Palm Springs.

The park is very well manicured
and maintained.  My kids enjoyed the playground when they were younger.  Now, we just walk our dogs around the park.  There's plenty of tennis & and basketball courts also.

The only thing I don't care for are the homeless folks that hang out outside the restrooms.  But, I must say that I've never been harassed.<//Text>< resp>

<name>Ron Venezia< /name><review>Park is clean and safe, we don't go very frequently,  but I pass it often as I work in that area a lot and it always looks maintained. Playset is good for the kids. Wish my kids could experience the giant slide that was there when I was little. My wife and I remember it as a 10 story tall steel tower of death, that you had to get up and down quick so your skin didn't burn burn off in the summer. Great fun.<//review>< Resp>

<Review>Very nice and shady park/recreation area with a bit of something for everyone. Grassy areas for picnicking or strolling around. Our doggy loved it. On a somewhat humorous note I'd check with the dept. Of recreation to make sure your picnic lunch/dinner doesn't get rained on by the park's sprinklers  as we witnessed this while there.</Review>< resp>

<Review>Ruth Hardy Park is a great park overall.  It offers a lot of space where one can engage in all types of activities.  Basketball, tennis courts, play ground, dog area, outdoor fitness machines (very basic) and several picnic tables with outdoor grills.  Plenty of parking. Large perimeter to walk.  Its not a loud park with cars pumping out loud music. Its kept very clean and tidy.   There is a larger elder community who enjoy this park.  Sometimes you'll see company picnics and the occasional flag football games being enjoyed.  There are a tiny bank of bleachers at the tennis courts. I do recommend this park for anyone who seeks a simple outdoor fix.</Review>< pics>

<text>Very nice park right in the middle of the Movie Colony neighborhood. I have toured through a few other areas/neighborhoods in the PS area and the MC is def my favorite. Most of the homes are secluded and not visible from the streets. The homes you can see though are beautiful and maintained. The park does have BBQs and seating areas but not a lot of shade. I would imagine the park is not used very much during the summer heat. Unless it's between 5am to 10am and then again after sunset.</text>< pics>

My 18 month old daughter would give this park 5 stars.  Lots of swings, only 2 infant swings though, and plenty of slides and things to climb on.  Seemed to be well maintained and free of any litter.< /Review>

Since Covid-19 I started walking when my gym closed. Hardy Park paramiter is about 1 mile.  I walk this in the mornings and have met a nice group of people. It helps in feeling less isolated during these uncharted times.
The park is well kept and has a wide varitey of venues. Tennis, meditation gardens, outdoor excerise gym. Great park to visit anytime.< /Text>

<Text>Our extended family came together for a week this spring in a large home near Ruth Hardy Park for the second time. It was a big part of a wonderful experience for all of us-eight adults and seven kids. We played tennis and bocce ball, chased each other around on the grass, hung out and took daily walks in and around it. It’s a Palm Springs treasure.</Text>< name>

< review>
Pet friendly,  but some people allow there dogs to run freely. It's a great place to walk in the summer around dusk,  but sometimes there are coyotes,  be aware. The basketball court seems to always be busy,  also the playground seems to really delight the children.  It's nice to have a park close by,  it really just needs a dog park.  That would be my idea of perfection.< /review>

<Review>Ruth Hardy Park was a delightful experience for my dog and myself. There were several other dogs they're all friendly and most dogs are leashed although you can let them run but you just need to be aware of community police driving through. Sometimes you will be given a warning but generally it's just a verbal warning if it's the first time they've seen you with a dog off-leash. I like to let my dachshund run just for a few minutes just to get some exercise and the rest of the time we spend on the leash. It's a good place for kids to go they have a lot of great slides and things to climb on and all different types of things that are enjoyed by children so it's also the location of the City Community picnic Every Spring and it's it's great for Gatherings picnics reunions that type of thing.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80db1bbe49015a25:0xd322eb15ac10bbd7< /GmapID></record>

I remember playing football with friends on Saturdays,  we would turn the big open area south of the  tennis courts into a field and it was on! Everyone would come out , some to play and some to watch ! I even proposed to my (now ex-wife ) here at the park , mostly great memories from the old days!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80db1bbe49015a25:0xd322eb15ac10bbd7< /Gmap_id></record>

RHP and the adjacent Wellness Park are in my 'hood and I do my 3-4 mile fast-walk through them 3-4 times a week. They are both very nice parks; they're well maintained, there's usually plenty of easy going people, often with their dogs, occasional events - overall very nice public outdoor spaces... my only gripe, and this would hold true in most public parks anywhere, the restrooms are kinda nasty...<//Text>

Nice tennis courts at a lovely public park. The tradition is, when players are waiting they get to play whoever wins the last set. It's a great way to meet people and enjoy fun tennis.<//text>

<Text>This park is spacious, clean and beautiful. There's something for everyone. Jungle jams and large play area for childten. There's volleyball courts, basketball courts,  tennis courts, water turtles (not sure if the waters on), plenty of shade trees, picnic tables and grill s.  The wellness park is incredible. There are different exercise stations as you walk along beautiful meandering walkways...saw an out door yoga class there and lots of dog's.<//Text>< pics>

<text>This is a nice park with a lot of parking. I came here to walk my dogs on leash. There is no fenced area specifically for dogs, but it's big enough that you can let them off leash if they have good recall and are well socialized (I'm not sure what the official rules of the park are in that regard so YMMV). There's also tennis courts, basketball hoops, and a children's playground. The wellness park in the northwest corner of the park is really beautiful and peaceful, a great place to bring a book and a sit a while.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80db1bbe49015a25:0xd322eb15ac10bbd7<//gmapID><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

Nice park. We were there at noon in July and the picnic benches did not have any shade but there were shared grass areas.<//Text>

Best place in Palm Springs to get a pick-up tennis match. Come early because the locals know to get finished before the heat sets in.</Review>

<Review>Lovely park in central Palm Springs.  There are several tennis courts that are moderately used and large open areas for other activities. For children there is an extensive playground and sand lot.  The health park in the northwest corner has nice plantings, work out areas and a labyrinth.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Fix the lighting and tennis court nets. Please put more lighting down the paths and on the field. People smoke anyway which is terrible and they have unleashed dogs. Please reinforce NO smoking and ALWAYS leash your pets. Otherwise, conveniently located, generally clean, good parking, no pool though, I love the bags for pet waste. Great place to exercise!< /text>

The locals who think they own the tennis courts are a bunch of weasles. After my 11 y.o. daughter and I waited our turn to take over a court during our short winter getaway, a group of them waltzed in after we’d been playing all of three minutes & lectured me on how foursomes have precedent over doubles. I get it if we’d been playing for 30+ mins (like all the other courts), but really?! You’re gonna kick a Serena-loving aspiring player off the court?! Go join a country club if you jerks are so important and unable to wait. Welcome to stuffy Palm Springs!</Text>

The strangest thing happened, the lights went out at 8 on the basketball court and playground. While the tennis courts stayed on. Curious why that happened?</Review>
