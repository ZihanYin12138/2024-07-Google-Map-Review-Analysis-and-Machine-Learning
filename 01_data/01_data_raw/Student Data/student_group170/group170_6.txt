He was super patient, nice and made you comfortable with what you want as a customer. 11/10 for being extremely clean when handling everything. He was very knowledgeable about explaining the piercing process and after care. I've been wanting to get a helix piercing for a long time and ended up leaving the shop with more! Will be back for more piercings in the future after I'm all healed up. Thank you Jared!!<//review><username>Lorraine Weaver<//username><date>1627078483148<//date></record>

Went in for a large back tattoo by Steve. And came out happy and feeling proud. The details and the tattoo itself is so satisfying to look at. Even my family can't stop being impressed by it. Definitely recommend Steve for tattoo. Also price was reasonable with him.<//review>

<Review>I was so scared to get my nose pierced and Jared was just absolutely amazing!! Talked us through the whole thing and was so professional and nice. When my friend got dizzy after her piercing he even left the shop to go get her some water! This dude is amazing! Highly recommend 1000%. We will be back for Jared!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Honestly this place was pretty cool; nice, clean, and well-maintained. The atmosphere was pretty inviting too. I came in to get an industrial piercing and the piercer (Jared) did such an amazing job, he 100% took his time and carefully planned out exactly how he believed it would look best on my ear. He was professional while maintaining a friendly attitude. Pretty happy with the results. My ONE and only complaint is the pricing; it seems to be a bit pricier here and it’s borderline fine for the service I received, BUT the problem is that I contacted the piercer directly and was told it would cost $50 PLUS an extra $10 off, just for me. Now, it was my fault for not remembering to check if he replied back until after I went to go get it pierced. So, I decided to call the shop directly as well in hopes of getting an answer quicker. They told me it would be $60. Pricey, but I was fine with it. When I went in, they gave me the same price and that’s what’s I paid. Later that day I checked my messages and saw that he told me it would be $40. So, I’m pretty bummed out that the piercer told me it would be $40, yet charged me an extra $20. I enjoyed my experience but didn’t appreciate that at all, so unfortunately gonna have to second-guess if I want to come back here again.< /Review>< Name>

I am here in Visalia on a business trip and had just recently lost my grandpa.  I wanted to get a little script in memory of him so I walked over and they got me right in. Brian and the entire staff are very nice. They are reasonably priced and very located in a very nice area downtown. I would recommend them to anyone! Thank you for the beautiful tattoo!<//text>

The stencil of my tattoo was perfect, however, it was horrible after it was tatted on. I was a little bummed out considering I paid for something I didn’t like. The workers are extremely friendly and the environment was comfortable.</review>

<Review>I was discriminated against, for having darker ton skin. I was told because i have a darker ton i cant get color tattoos. I have already three tattoos with color. I can understand if he said sorry i dont know how to, but he blammed the color of my skin. This guy may have 16 years in experience in tattooing but he has 0 experience in respect. I served this country to come home an be disrespected by some small fry that cant even try an attempt to do a good job an perfect his skills. I wont ever go back.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Steve did a cover up on me with koi fish..i loved it but when i went back for him to add to it he totally did his own thing and didnt listen to the color scheme i wanted then when i told him i didnt like he freaked out on me and told me i didnt know what i was talking about and said he would finish the piece for more money. Total egocentric who honestly doesnt keep his word....decent tattoo artist but his attitude isnt worth dealing with him.</Review><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

I celebrated my graduation earlier this evening in this fine place. happy to tell that it was a incredible evening and the place was definitely one of the reasons for this fruitful meeting. The crew  collaborated in a sweet way, the food was great and my friends were extremely  overjoyed. We shall surely visit again for more events. Thank you very much.< /review>

It's pretty good. Just realize it's lunch meat and a lot of sugar they pass off as bread. It's fast food. Do not mistake it as healthy. Otherwise it's good, if a little overpriced once you realize it's lunch meat and sugar.< /Review>

Very nice large Subway sandwich store. This one is the only one that’s open early enough for you to grab a sandwich to take to work before 8 AM. I think they open at seven. I grabbed a sandwich in the sandwich master was a very nice young gentleman thank you<//Review>

Normal Subway restaurant. Always clean, always fresh, and most of the time very friendly staff, even when it's busy at lunch. I've never used the restrooms, neither have I gotten soda so can't speak of that. Cookies are good!<//text>

Make your own sandwich, what could go wrong? The "ask about this sauce" are really good. Especially the bbq looking one. Southwest sauce is my fav.<//review>

<Review>Really love this little store, they take time to learn your name and when the line seems daunting they keep with the positive even though most of the people in Ridgecrest act entitled and arrogant these guys are troopers and make it how you want it, they give nice handfuls of ingredients and sample out the sauces just Incase you might want some. Love the energy and will say of the three locations in town this is my favorite one.</Review><resp>None</resp>< time>

<review>Fairly extensive range of Mini related items which can be grouped by particular car, so as Clubman owner, I needed only search items for F54.  Of course there are numerous items suitable for all Mini enthusiasts as well.  Items arrived promptly after shipping.  Promotions regularly run so would encourage email alerts.  All in all a 5 star experience.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Extremely poor service. I had ordered an oxygen sensor from their website on 11/6/2020 and since I needed it immediately I opted for the FedEx second day shipping. As soon as the order was placed I received a confirmation email that said that the order may not be shipped due to product not being in stock ( this by the way was not indicated on the website at the time of purchase) when I called to see why the order was taken if the product is not in stock the lady on the phone told me that they order the parts from a third party company and the part should be on the way within a week. I then asked her if I can be refunded for the second day shipping since that clearly was not going to be the case she told me that if I did that it would be even slower to get the part. On 11/10/2020 I placed a second follow up call and was told that someone would call me soon to let me know when the part would be shipped. No one called. I called back and after a few holds Lisa assured me that the part would ship today or tomorrow. I asked again if the second day shipping would be refunded and she told me that it was "only $20" and it is a standard shipping charge, even though it clearly states that the $20 is for a second day FedEx shipping on my invoice. At this point I asked to be refunded the entire order plus $20 since it seemed to me $20 didn't seem much to Lisa when it came to me paying it but she met the proposal with such a disbelief when I asked for an extra $20 at my return. You guys can complain all you want about Amazon and other online retailers but I have never been treated in such manner by Amazon. I am not a fan of their might either but the bottom line is that they provide goods and services that meet people's expectations. And until you do, they will dominate and continue to drive businesses like yours down. Off to Amazon to get my parts less the shipping and aggravation of Lisa telling that I should not worry about a $20 shipping charge.< /text>

<Text>The part I needed was easy to find using general descriptors, and then narrowing it down to the specific part. The photo illustration was useful to confirm the part was the right replacement. Shipping was quick, packaging was secure, and the part was of the same quality as the original. Very pleased!< /Text>< gmapID>

I love my Mini bike rack.   It works great and it came much earlier than expected.   The only draw back is that my daughter and I both ride 50 inch road bikes and they don't fit quite right - good enough that I'm not afraid of losing the bikes.   The bottom rack adjustments on the inside could use another inch of adjustment.< /Review>

< review>
The windshield wipers are perfect and just what was needed for my car. We looked all over town and online and couldn’t find the right ones until we found them on Mini Mania. We know where to go the next time I need new blades. The communication via email was great as well.<//review>

Everything i bought was as described except for the adaptor to connect iphone 8 to usb and jack, apparently i only works for older model iphones maybe, i could have returned it but was not worth the hassle , delivery was fast and would buy again in the future, I’m new to mini’s and not familiar with some things so it would be nice to have better explanation on things but great site none the less.</Text>

ONE thing: The oil filter drainage screw varies: its either a T55 (torx) or 13-14mm; would have helped me to know which as the T55 did not screw in properly with the oil filter housing.

I purchased an exhaust system with cold air intake kit; and, head lamp covers online. Mini Mania site was easy to navigate, and product costs were competitive. The product was quickly shipped and received within 5 business days. Plus, their customer service is great. No disappointments.<//Review>

<Text>`Ordered parts for brake adjuster. 2 parts required for both rear wheels. I found them available from an overseas source but thought I could save some time ordering from a U.S. based company. Over a week after I received my order confirmation I received an email stating that ALL parts were in stock and should ship in the next 1 to 3 days.
Fast forward 16 days after first confirmation.  I receive an email stating that 2 of the parts I had ordered were not in stock and they had no idea when they would be available. The other 2 (worthless without the missing 2 ) would ship in 1 to 3 days. OVER 2 WEEKS AFTER CONFIRMATION!  Now, after losing 16 days with the car sitting apart I'm still going to have to order from overseas. What a wreck of a company. AVOID THESE GUYS!!!</Text>< UserId.>

Really need to edit the images on their website. Ordered an axle for my 2003 Mini Cooper and on the image for the product, it showed the bracket on the axle. When the axle arrived, there was no bracket. The axle worked fine, and they answered the calls, so it was just kinda a luke warm experience.< /text>

<Text>The general speed of the shipping and selection available are nice, unfortunately it needs to add more details about the products it sells. I bought the magnetic stripes hoping for a shorter term fix to replace the cracking vinyl on my R56 hatch but they're about an inch narrower than the original bands are for the car so I'll have to just go buy the oem instead.< /Text><userid>114559958139055157313</userid></record></dataset><record>

The Mini Mania team AND their supplier pulled out all the stops and got my parts to me with the speed required to keep my production on schedule.  "Poor Little Red" will ride again and MM has earned my business until the day I'm too goofy to drive.  THANKS TO ALL OF YOU!< /Text>

It does what it is intended to do. I had hope that it would pop out as easily as it went in. Since this is used to cover a trailer hitch, it would be convenient to remove with ease when needed.<//Review>

<Review>The last part I purchased was technically complete, however it was a hydraulic clutch line with quick disconnects to the slave and up stream tubing, however the clips that hold the QD coupling from falling apart were completely rusted and unusable, I hade to make some from stainless steel wire to complete the job, the clips are insignificant compared to the huge mark-up of the price and it would be proper for these to be included with that part< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I bought a mirror and couple of lamps for a 1976 mini classic. I had ordered a left side mirror but got a right side one. When I told them they shipped the correct one promptly without any issue. Didn't have to ship the other mirror back or anything. Also the online chat available is very helpful if you have questions. Excellent company, great service!< /Text>

At first I was thinking "Wow these guys are great!  They've got all the parts I need and they are at really good prices"  But after I ordered a few things I started to get turned off from them.  My first order was tires, they had them in stock and got them shipped out no problem.  Then I ordered something else, they didn't have it in stock and gave me a new date.  Several weeks after the new date went by and no word.  I called and asked what was going on, they told me another new date.  Now I am waiting almost 2 months for the parts I ordered.  I found them overseas in Britain so I cancelled my order with them.

The last thing I ordered I needed ASAP so I put in for 2 day shipping.  On the 2nd day, Friday, when my order should have arrived (ordered Tuesday night, shipped Wed, arrive Fri) I got an email saying my order had shipped.......  I didn't pay for one week shipping, I paid for 2 DAY shipping.  Now my part was late and not worth the extra money I paid.

All that said, I would give 1 star for the slow shipping services.  But calling and emailing the staff, they are all very nice and easy to deal with.  They send you to the right person and can help you out with questions to make sure you get the right parts.  Unfortunately the few bad purchase services I got and the fact that they charge double for the same parts I can buy from Britain means I will be ordering direct from Britain from now on.<//text>

I received my order quickly, but I received the wrong parts (4 spark plugs).  The part package were labeled as for my MINI, but nothing like the parts that are currently in my MINI.  The received parts were too short & was hex rather that bi-hex.  I intend to return parts for refund, & I may not order from them again (we'll see).< /text>

I have been buying from Mini Mania for a few years, for my 2011 Countryman All 4, my previous mini, a 2004 CooperS, and a 1976 Austin Mini I got late in 2016. My experience with Mini Mania is that they are not perfect, but neither am I. They are consistently prompt and responsive to my emails and phone calls. I have had all sorts of issues nailing down exactly what i need for the 1976 Mini (not the original engine and it was an Italian-made version). I have ordered the wrong part on occasion and have not had any issues with returns and refunds/credit. They have also made a mistake in what was sent once, and they made it right, quickly and with no excuses. I would not hesitate to recommend this company and I would take the negative reviews on here with a big grain of salt.<//review>

Received in great time from Minimania but disappointed with the price of the tool and delivery Cost $100.00 Australian to get it with no real instructions on how it works effectively. I have downloaded the instructions from the web site - clear as mud</Review>

I ordered an A pillar trim piece for my Mini.  The original had blown off after a windshield install.  The part arrived sooner than I had expected.  I was satisfied with the service.

I failed to notice that the little trim piece where the A pillar meets the roof had also blown off.  I could not find that piece on the web site so I'll need to call them to see if they have it.</review>

<Review>Arden Park Florist always does an amazing job! In the past I have ordered bouquets for my daughter's theater productions, corsages for my daughter's homecoming and my son's homecoming boutonnieres. Recently, my son and his finance decided to get married at the last minute and Arden Park Florist did another awesome job! With less than 24 hours, they created a beautiful bouquet that my new daughter-in-law held and a simple, yet elegant boutonniere for my son. The flowers were exactly what we envisioned and added just the right color.
Also, the staff is simply the best. Kind, considerate and provides the best in customer service.< /Review><response>None<//response><name>Crystelle Turlo<//name>< gmap_id>

<Text>The bouquet was delivered late on Sunday afternoon. The bouquet consisted of 6 roses and filler. The roses were already drooping and looking tired. It would have been Better to have waited a day or two to send out fresh flowers than the tired ones that were delivered. I understand that it was mother's day and it's probably one of the busiest times of the year but the floral arrangement should definitely should have been fresh and not have petals look wilted.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Our florist we have used for years went out of business so we thought we would try Arden Park Florist.  We ordered 2 Mothers Day bouquets, mine was delivered and the next day the flowers were droopy and wilted, and a couple of the roses had dark spots on them. We immediately called the shop, the lady who answered the phone asked if we followed  the care directions, which we did.  She put us on hold when she got back on line said they will deliver another bouquet to me on Monday.  Here it is Wednesday have not received a delivery or a return call back.  Very disappointed and will not buy from them again!  Horrible customer service!!  Wish I read the reviews before we went in, could have gotten a better bouquet from Walmart!!!</text>< rate>

<text>This was my first time ordering from Arden Park Florist. The online ordering was simple, clear and quick. The email notifications were helpful but what I really appreciated is the service of the driver. Unbeknownst to me there was a gate at the recipient's complex. The driver called the recipient, who ended up not being home. Between the driver and recipient they determined that delivery the next day would be best.  I appreciate the driver taking the initiative to determine a better delivery time.</text>< GmapID>

<Review>The driver showed up the viewing three hours late.  Walked in on the family who was viewing their loved one, moved other flower arrangement around and set his arrangement up front and center.  THEN had the gall to ask the grieving family to sign stating the flower arrangement was delivered.<//Review>< username>

We have used this florist four times now and were very pleased.  They have made up some beautiful bouquets for us for a reasonable price.  They make a very nice gift and are so much nicer than the bouquets in the grocery stores.  The shop is charming and the staff friendly. Feels good to support a family owned local shop.  We will be back.</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>The floral arrangements Nykole made for our wedding were absolutely stunning.  In every picture posted of me so far on social media, yes, everyone of course is like, "Oh, you look so beautiful!" but it is almost immediately proceeded or followed by, "But your bouquet!!"

Nykole also made our Chuppah for our wedding, and when I say made...I MEAN SHE MADE IT.  She and her family constructed the Chuppah from scratch out of birch branches and gorgeous blooms.  It was unbelievable.  Nykole designed the Chuppah to be deconstructed so they could set up the top of it behind Jeffrey and I at our head table, and the bottom part to stand behind the cake.  Amazing.

Nykole and her team really worked their butts off for our big day.  Everything was stunning and beautiful.  Expect a bigger price tag, but do know that they are putting their heart and souls into your event to match that price tag.   Frankly with the amount of work Nykole puts into the event, she is probably undercharging.  But I don't know, I'm not in the industry, haha!  I just know I've rarely met a woman so dedicated to making our event so special.  Thank you so much, Nykole, and to your family!</Text><gmap_id>0x809adb0c1b33c755:0x36ca1a00cbcf0ad8<//gmap_id><time>1576955619704</time>< Rating>

<Review>I have been a certified florist for over 20 years. I was hired as a designer by this shop for Valentine's Day of 2014. I was absolutely horrified by their standards and practices. They had moldy flowers in their cooler, which I was told to pick off the moldy petals. The flowers were not processed correctly giving the flowers a much shorter life span. Their backroom and tools were filthy, which introduces bacteria into the flowers' stems causing them to wilt and die within a day or two. They did not keep enough inventory in stock to meet the wired flower orders and more times than not, substituted with less expensive and sub-par flowers. They took approximately five times more orders for Valentine's Day than they had product or labor in which to fulfill the orders. Valentine's Day was a nightmare! My heart broke for the customers, and I quit that night.<//Review>< Pictures>

I ordered flowers to be delivered. The photo showed 6 beautifully arranged sunflowers. I paid extra for the premium arrangement which was supposed to have even more flowers. They delivered 4 sunflower with hardly any fill at all. TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!! I paid 80 dollars for 4 sunflowers that I could of picked up at the store for 5!< /Review>

<Date>1550608855339<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>My husband ordered a plant for an anniversary a week in advance. On the day of our anniversary they called him at 10:30 to tell him they did not have the plant he wanted.  They told him they could send something similar. I received my flowers at 3:00. The day is almost over. It was cut flowers and the pot had a crack. Could not get a hold of anyone on the phone their mailbox was full so I had to stop at their store. I went in to the new building, which why you would have it open when it is plywood and a mess. I waited for my turn (there were 2 people in front of me). The girl behind the counter asked if she could help me. I said yes, please. I told her I received a plant and the pot was cracked. I was frustrated how I could not get through on the phone. She said sorry as she was looking down wrapping some flowers. I asked her if she was still talking to me. She said yes, she was multi tasking helping the man before me. I told he to take care of him and I would wait. I said she did not seem engaged in our conversation. She said they were very busy. The man behind the counter took is hand from over his head and banged in on the counter and told me I was rude. very angry and aggressive. The owner said DAD its OK. He proceeded to say its not ok and to just give me my money back and they did not need customers like me. He told her to get me the Fing out of the store. He kept pacing just making comments and making me unconformable.  I explained to him this is not personal it is business. I also asked does he treat all customers like this and does he normally treat women like this. Some one did not raise him right. It was a very bad experience and I will not go back in there. Not sure if he is always there, but makes me nervous.
The father left and the young woman said that I could come Monday and get the plant my husband ordered and bring back the other one.  Well they were not there on Monday as I found out when I drove over there. They are working out of their warehouse and not there all week. Now they told me they would get back to me. You would think knowing that they told me Monday, the owner would have taken the call.  we will see.....
I think they take care of their old time customers and anyone they know and any one else gets whatever.

I would not recommend using them.<//review>< pics>

This family owned shop has always taken great care of my family and friends for special occasions as well as (my favorite service) being able to get loose wrapped bouquets for any amount I'm looking to spend. I don't usually review a store but I just googled the shop to place an order for Valentines Day and want Arden Park Florist Florist to be recognized for the service they've given over the years.< /text>

Oh I'd TOTALLY recommend Arden Park Florist & Gift gallery﻿ to you (if I hated you and wanted you to be sad).

They're GREAT at taking your money and talking about how flowers will get delivered.  Oh they'll do that all day long baby!  They're basically the floral equivalent to Kobe Bryant or LeBron James when it comes to taking your money and promising you flowers.  But the part where they actually make the arrangement, put them it on a truck, and drive it to a specific location... they don't excel at that.  You wanted FLOWERS?!  Take your weak ass expectations and check them at the door loser!

More or less you will call them, place your order, give them your money and that's it. It's a weird business model, I know.  Some might even call it stealing. But those people are jerks!  This is high concept stuff here!

You might even try to call them to ask when/if your flowers will ever be delivered and they'll reply "I don't know" or "Probably." Honestly it's a refreshing change of pace.  I spend too much time knowing that when i give a business my money I'll actually get what I paid for.  It's so cliche!!! I like surprises... especially bad ones!  And really guys... your wife will have a ton of great Valentine's Days. If you really want to surprise her this year, toss in an awful one!

If you hate good customer service and getting what you paid for, call Arden Park Florist today!!</Text>

<Review>HORRIBLE! I ordered flowers for my wife via Teleflora. I ordered 24 long stem roses in a glass vase. What did she receive? Eff-ing carnations and one rose in a wicker basket. I am FURIOUS!!! My wife HATES carnations!!! This florist RUINED Valentine’s Day!!! I can’t believe what a piece of junk arrangement they sent!! Carnations are not substitute for roses!!! A florist that thinks that would be okay SHOULDN’T BE A FLORIST!

Please see my attached picture!

I think this florist intentionally sends out junk bouquets! Example, the bouquet I ordered was $120. The one they actually sent is worth $10. I’ll call to complain about not getting the correct bouquet, then Teleflora will have to refund me at least 50%, which is $60. They made $50!!! Get it? Such a terrible business practice! I hope Teleflora is reading this and they stop doing business with this terrible florist.

The email I received said the flowers were delivered. NOT!! I called 1-800-flowers to confirm the delivery. He said "yes, they were delivered and ____ signed for them". Well, That was impossible because ____ and I were out to dinner at that time!  NEVER got my flowers from ARDEN PARK. NOT recommending them at all!!!   When you call to get information NO-ONE answers, no matter how many times you call. NO-WAY !!!!<//Review>

I ordered flowers for my mother-in-law through 1800Flowers for her birthday. The pitcher/vase was as shown in the photo but the flowers were HORRIBLE! They were cheap and weak and dying when they were delivered. They looked NOTHING like the photo. So after 2 hours of trying to get through to 1800Flowers, they apologized and said they would send another bouquet at no charge the next day. They sent out the same florist, who demanded the original vase to be returned immediately. Not to mention that the second arrangement was even worse than the first one. 1800Flowers did refund our money but this review is for Arden Park Florist. I would STAY AWAY from this place.< /review>

So mad cause what's the purpose of it if she got it before going home. I could just brought some from the store and gave it to her myself and save $80. Never again will I order from them. Always have an excuse every time I call tok see where the driver was at.<//text>< Pictures>

Arden Park florist provided beautiful bouquets, table decorations, boutonnieres and wrist bands for my daughter's September wedding.
It's been a week and I still have one of the bridesmaid's bouquets blooming on my kitchen table.</Text>

<date>1392402897195<//date><rate>1<//rate><text>Who in the world delivers flower arrangement until 10 pm???  I received a call on 2/13/14 at past 9 pm (which I'm already asleep) and left a message as the driver has flower delivery for me. Left a message to call the shop. It took me so many tries before I can even get someone to answer the phone. Unfortunately, I can't get my flowers rerouted to work since delivery was already mapped out for the day. That they can deliver it on monday.. What's the purpose of delivering on monday when Valentine's day is past already. I mentioned also that I will be out of town and won't be back until monday night but I guess they don't offer to bend over and backwards for their customers and make an exception. If you can't deliver flowers on time, don't take so much orders .. that's all I can say. 3 years in a row that the deliveries were screwed up and the flowers doesn't even look it's best for $100+ charge. Thanks for nothing.<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
I'm so upset to have to do a negative review of Arden Park Florist(APF).  I've been using them for over 12 years now and never have had any issues.  I would be the first to speak up and recommend them to friends and work associates.  However, now that I've had to deal with a mistake they've made I've seen the true colors of how these people operate.

This was a simple order for flowers to be delivered to my mother on 5/7/16 for Mother's Day.  I ordered the flowers on the 2nd, my personal bank account was charged for them on the 4th and they arrived on the 8th.  (yes, a day late....and they were rotten!)

I get to work on the 9th and notice that there is a charge from APF in my business's account.  How did this happen???  I didn't even use that card for this purchase.  I looked at my personal account again and confirmed that APF had now been paid twice for these rotten flowers.  Once by me and once by my business.

I call APF and a younger girl answers.  I explain that I've been double charged and need a refund.  She proceeds to tell me that the system shows that I've only paid once.  She tells me that "she'll have Laura call me back...maybe there's another computer screen that Laura can look at and confirm my claim."  So, I wait 24 hours...no call back.

I find their email address on their website and send them an email with copies of both bank account statements, with the debits circled.  I hear nothing.  So, I call APF and Laura answers.  Apparently she didn't even know about my problem...but then quickly told me that she can't help me, only the owner can.  So I tell her, "Please have Nykole call me.  I've sent her an email with back-up and need this resolved ASAP".  She seemed surprised that I knew the owner's name.  Like I said, I've been their customer for over 12 years.  However, I get no phone call back from Nykole.

I do get an order confirmation email that shows that they're sending my mother replacement flowers.  Well, okay...that part is fixed, but I've still not heard anything regarding a refund for the second charge.  So, I send another email.  I get no response.  I come in to work the next day and see that they have now charged my business's account again!  So...they were paid THREE times for these flowers!!  Two times out of an account they were never authorized to charge!  Ugh......so I threaten legal action.  Finally get a response from Nykole.  Below is a copy of the email I received from her:

"I am currently not in the shop and I could only find one  currwnt active charge on your account last week and sent you a copy of all charges in your name.
I will double check on the 10th for you. I am sorry you feel the need to be so hasty in this matter.
As I would never intentionally steal from a client.
The reason your bank could not do a charge back is because there is no orginal charge against your card it was declined with an error.
I will have someone in my shop contact you as soon as possible."

...again, no apology.  No acknowledgement of the fact that I've sent copies of the bank statements that prove they've been paid three times for these flowers.  No one from her shop contacts me.  All I get is some lame response about how their computer system is apparently faulty since they only see one payment from me.  I checked with my bank.  There were no "errors" on their end and the charges were in fact true debits from the accounts and I no longer had access to said funds.

They did finally refund the second charge on my business account, but have yet to refund the first charge.  They've chosen to ignore me an hope I go away.  This morning I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  If there's no response to that, I will hire an attorney and get this resolved.

Be careful if you give APF a credit card number!  You never know when it'll come back to haunt you!!!<//review>

My mom ordered flowers to be sent to my work, they never arrived. The store then says that I live too far away for them to be delivered to my house (I live 15 mins from the shop) but I can pick then up. Absolutely ridiculous.<//Review>

The Valentine's Day flowers I received from this place were wilted and lifeless, not to mention they weren't even the flowers that my boyfriend ordered and upgraded. I called in and was told that I would be receiving a new delivery with a new bouquet on Friday...5:00 came and went so I decided to go to the shop myself. As soon as I went in with the bouquet that I received the day before that looked like it was about a week old on day two, I was treated like I was crazy. I explained the situation and I was told that I didn't speak to anybody in the shop, I was informed that the answering service answered and shouldn't have told me that I would be getting a new bouquet without checking with the shop first. I'm sorry, I didn't know that when I call the number that is listed on your page and someone answers and tells me that I will be getting a new bouquet that I should have verified that I was speaking with somebody in the shop...Are you kidding me??? As I was waiting for my new bouquet, somebody else came in with the same issue and was treated about the same as I was being treated. The worst customer service that I have ever encountered! I wish there was a button that just said, POOR on it and not Poor - Fair, because there is nothing fair about this place!<//Review>

We changed the water... added nutrients that they sent and three days later all but three rose stems have crimped and fallen over...

Paige and Kaitlyn  went above and beyond  for  multiple customers  as my wife and I walked into the store. Kaitlyn  took the time to help a customer with transferring the photos to pictures  due to them being transferred as files over to the new phone. While Paige  helped us purchase our s21+phones and set them up. Paige set up my wife's phone just in time for closing whole my phone transfer was being  a snail. The whole time I was treated with kindness and respect  the whole time. Best experience in years I have had getting a new phone. Thank you!<//Text>

Over the past couple years I've purchased 4 or 5 phones with accessories from this store. Why? Because Saydee knows your products. The last 3 phones w/ accessories I bought for me were what she personally has. She's always able to answer my questions. If I visit your store and she's not working, I leave and come back when she's there. I've had workers (yes, yours) guess. SAYDEE don't guess, she knows. You keep her working....you keep me and my family coming back. You should have her train all your employees.<//Text>

Customer service is always great. The only thing that I’d recommend is keep better stock on accessories(screen protector/Phone cases). Other then that everything was great<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>My experience at Russell Cellular was excellent  I am not tech savvy and Savannah was the person that took care of me. Her professionalism, understanding of the products, ability to explain, broad knowledge of all cell phones and her kindness was staggering. She was so patient with me and there was not a question I had that was not answered. I felt confident when I left I would be able to operate my phone. I am a 67 yr old Grandmother and Savannah really took time with me. I highly recommend Russell Cellular.< /review>< Pics>

The employees at this location handled a very difficult customer in a calm and professional manner. I was highly impressed. Not to mention, they helped me out with my purchase with no issue. They were clear and concise with listing out details of my transaction, which helped me understand what I was purchasing. I would highly recommend using this location for cell phone service!< /text>

Paige at Russell Cellular in Oakhurst CA was extremely helpful to me when I was trying to figure out my new iPhone 12 pro. I was very frustrated with it because I had been on the phone literally hours to try and get tech help. They tried but couldn't help. Paige was welcoming, and fixed my issue in a very short time. No frustration involved. Thanks Paige<//Review>

<text>I was really without a phone due to Spyware that just took it over and shut it down. I needed a new carrier and a new phone. I was very brain dead with all the stress. Both customer service techs worked very efficently and between them made the correct decision and found the best deal. I was gonna make a rediculas choice. They completely setup new email and advised me on what to do with the hack. I was there a short period of time and with their calm intelligent help I walked out peaceful and happy with the money they saved me.  Very good experience.</text><gmap_id>0x809427b836e41c79:0x2a147e93cb47c5ac</gmap_id></record>

Couple miles down the road I remembered. Went back and found my tablet and my phone shattered like falling apart broken. Got my phone replaced through the insurance. I took my tablet in to your shop. I do believe it was Christina to help me. I caught her at your Oakhurst shop on the last day you were open up here. I was very shocked that it could be repaired. So a week later I pick my tablet up at your Fresno office. And it looked brand new. Works well and all my information came back onto my tablet. Was much easier than trying to reprogram my phone.Thank you so much for all the help and information I will definitely come back if I have any more problems.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I just got my new cellphone through Russell Cellular in Oakhurst.  I couldn’t be more pleased!  They ordered my phone and it came in a day earlier than quoted.  The service was great.  Savannah was patient, explained everything, and answered all my questions.  I will buy my next phone from them..... I’ll never go to A Verizon store in Fresno ever again.<//Text>

Walked into store frustrated with poor service from original vendor and Saydee Bennett in the Oakhurst Verizon store immediately greeted me and addressed my issues. She discussed my options and I selected a Samsung A21 with accessories. Saydee made the whole transaction a breeze! And I especially appreciate that she and Paige another employee skillfully transferred all my data to the new cell and I completely relaxed during that process. They were friendly and professional. I knew I was in good hands and very glad to bring them my business. Highly recommend that store for excellent customer service.</text>

<review>My husband and I went into the Verizon Oakhurst CA store because I wanted to switch my husband from AT&T over to Verizon because his phone was paid off and we wanted to save some money by combining our plan. Kris helped us out, got our new account all set up and set us up with the correct cell phone plan for us.

We ran into a problem with AT&T and them not releasing my husband’s phone. After my husband and I actually WENT to the AT&T location in Oakhurst to have them release his phone, they refused to help us and basically told us it was our problem to fix. We went back to Verizon, back to Kris and Kris called 5 numbers for AT&T to help us out and get my husbands phone unlocked. His customer service is excellent and I trust him with all my Verizon questions and needs. He is an excellent employee and goes above and beyond his job. He deserves a raise!</review>< Pictures>

Service is excellent, product is quality. I love being able to do prepaid. I do wish it was unlimited data, but that’s ok. I recommend switching to Verizon prepaid over any other company.<//Review>

Good service. They will try and sell you a lot of different programs. Be prepared and know what you want before you go in.< /Review>

<text>No one at the store when it was supposed to be open, no sign to suggest when they'd return nor the times they are open (had to listen to an annoying voice mail to figure out the times, was supposed to be open). Wanted to buy my dad a new phone case for fathers day, can't do that now. Thanks Verizon.< /text>< rating>

< Review>
I went in got my Samsung s10. I love the phone it's great. But they told me my plan would be $75 it's actually $80. Its 5 bucks I wasnt really concerned. But I've paid my bill everytime.. a little late cause of payday. But still played it. And now they are saying I'm 276.73. Of course I paid in cash. So they were able to screw me over. The employees are nice but half the time they dont seem to know what they are talking about. One tells you on one thing and another tells you something else<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>This store was a delight to be a patron of. The salesperson who helped me  was extremely polite and very knowledgeable in the whole process and made sure to find me the right plan and every possible promo that I was entitled to. Her name is Sadie. She had a smile the entire time and made the process go as smoothly as possible. Even though she was the person who helped me directly, everyone who worked there was happy and inviting. I would  definitely recommend not only Verivion as a whole but the Oakhurst location in the Rayleys shopping center personaly. I won't do business anywhere else ever again.</text>< Name>

I also stopped paying more version service and year ago putting me in a little debt... but Arthur who works here helped me review all options very fast and easy and now I have phone service and will forever be going back to ensignal for the awesome service!

<text>Service was poor due to wrong information given causing a lot of waiting .. hours...and waste of money. Not to mention inconvenience. A new employee quoted wrong price for upgrade.  After ordering phone, we waited 2 weeks and no phone arrived.  We went to office, and it took 3.. yes 3 hours for employee to hook up our phone while she had friends in office and her and manager kept talking to friend.  Manager didn't assist new employee who kept talking and texting on her phone to friend as we waited for upgrade, to find out she quoted us only a $40 per month increase for new note 8 to find out it would be $100 more per month.  In the meantime manager is outside on her cell smoking and chatting and new employee had to call district manager for help.  We decided to cancel the whole thing and many people kept coming into store and leaving.  After 3 hours, we left and spoke to the manager aND told her she lost customers and we were unhappy with the way things were handled and she said she was on PTO. ?...paid time off.  Is thus the way to run a business?  Poor girl in store alone with no help, customers inconvenienced and ready to stop Verizon altogether if this is how they operate.<//text>< Pictures>

I went in there for some technical things with my phone. Shelby the girl who helped me was amazing. But the man Arthur was just very rude. He was rude to the customers and made me feel uncomfortable. Other than that this store is great.</Review>

Pretty bad when you take your Verizon phone to an actual Verizon store and they're absolutely clueless when it comes to helping you get your issue resolved. But you can take it across the street to a Verizon authorized dealer and not only either get your issue resolved there or told how to get it resolved in another manner, but you get fantastic customer service!  Take your phones to the authorized dealer across the street.  You won't be sorry.<//Text>

Went into the store looking for a hotspot that would give us more GB.
Salesperson told us we would have a total of 45 GB -  up from 10 GB.
However, this does not apply to an old 10 GB plan which we currently have.  We are NOW locked into a 2 year contract on a hotspot device that is of no use to us.  It appears the salesperson is not only ignorant about the plans, but did not even look at our plan to determine whether or not the hotspot would be of any benefit to us.  We will never shop at this store again.<//text>

<Text>I went in because I have been paying too much, I was going to quit Verizon, I was greeted by a professional gentalman named Arthur from Fresno,  he provided me with an intense review of my bill and assisted me in gaining more value, and more knowledge, I feel he set me up for success.  He not only lowered my bill we upgraded are 3 lines and still are saving $60 a year. I also found out that verizon is a carrier that helps in natural disasters.  Arthur and the rest of the team are great at what they do,  Arthur has knowledge, and provided me with white glove service. Was a bit busy but worth the time I spent. Thank you Arthur, Saydie, Jennalee.  Give em a raise.</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><gmap_id>0x809427b836e41c79:0x2a147e93cb47c5ac<//gmap_id>< date>

<Text>This quiet little bar/snack shack used to be lake earl market. An end-of-the-road Oasis that I used to frequent as a kid. It was confusing at first when I walked in because I was expecting a market. Was happy to get a cold drink and hot food!
This would also be a good place to play Vr!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

It the little places, the "hole in the wall" that has the best food and service. We have been going here so long now, that Mama knows what we order every time. She greets us with a huge smile, and says, "tres y tres con pepperjack?!" To which we reply, "Si! Si! Port favor! Gracias!!" We always leave with the "itus," the same feeling you get from the tryptophan in Turkey. So full, slow, and sloth-like, a high need to unbutton the top button on your pants. Get the pork tacos.</review>

Got the asada burrito and 2 tacos with pepper Jack cheese. They make their own tortillas and have a nice seating area. It's a little difficult to spot if you havent been there before but it's well worth finding.<//Review>

Stop here!  Delicious, real homemade Mexican food.  We had the albondigas soup, a carnitas burrito,  and a side of beans. The most delicious beans in a long time! Don't miss this place.< /text>

Salsa isn't the typical tomatoes, cilantro, jalapenos, garlic, lime and salt and pepper, more of a dried chili kind, the kind my grandma made from Mexico. It wasn't as good though, and the Verde type salsa was a little oily, left a film on my tongue. All in all it was good, minus the "hot sauce "</text>< userid>

Gross setting, feel like the place hasn't been clean ever. Good food but the atmosphere ruins it by making you wonder if you can get botulism or dysentery off their silverware or table settings.</Text>

<Review>I was referred here by my niece.  Oh my goodness...this place is amazing. I got the Dragon Roll and the Tempura California Roll. Absolutely delicious.. My sister got the Popcorn Crab and the Bento Bix with teriyaki steak and tempura shrimp and veggies. Everything was fresh hot and again, delicious. I live in Rialto and it so good I travel to Ontario to get it!<//Review>< pictures>

The young ladies that work there are almost family now. They go above and beyond to make sure we enjoy our meal. The Bento Fried Rice is delicious and a must if you enjoy fried rice. Great food and great service! Bento Box offers a variety of sushi and 'cooked' rolls and rice paper instead of seaweed for people like me. There are many other items on the menu as well. Always a good meal!< /Review><GmapID>0x80dccad4e2e796b1:0x2f4fc88e87b8aefe< /GmapID>< user>

Service was a little slow but its because they only had one person taken orders and ringing people up.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5ZLnsb5u_DD_MtRTk9jbR2_pzfYwSSGV6flyA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dccad4e2e796b1:0x2f4fc88e87b8aefe</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Astonishingly fantastic. Despite it being a small restaurant, I personally find the area as a favorite on my list.
The food is delicious, the service is generally good, I can almost mark this as my favorite place to go to for any time of the day when I crave sushi.
Nothing there regarding their flaws don’t bother me a lot, though one thing that I notice is that the food can take a while at times. It doesn’t bother me, again, knowing it’s worth it at the end, but it’s mandatory to point out. Overall,
a solid 10/10. Great place.< /review>< pictures>

The sushi is tasty and fresh.Well worth the time to try it,small and cozy location. I loved this place. It is a cute little Japanese fast food restaurant. I had a combo box. It comes with Mazso soup, salad, rice and a great choice of 2 other items. We were surprised at the large serving for the reasonable price. Good sushi and a very clean establishment. What more would you want.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Small hole in the wall sushi restaurant in Ontario. Not a bad place to eat and take out the fam for dinner. Sushi rolls are good and tasty. The chicken ramen is delicious too. I don’t like their loyalty rewards tho, it took me a while to earn a $10 credit. Other than that, the food and service is quite good.</Text><Rating>4< /Rating>< Pics>

I use to come here regularly. Service was always bad. Young tall waitress always talking to coworkers and forgetting about us customers. So I came in for an order to go. Another girl took my order and missed an item. Had to go back after I got home to get my order. Never again. They always have a help wanted sign. Perhaps management should be there to supervise the waitresses< /Review>

Fantastic place.
One of my go to sushi places.
I love the variety of the menu.
The staff is lovely.
It's Cozy and the plum tea is divine.

However, they don't offer too many fried rolls. Which Is my preferred roll style.
But overall fantastic place :)< /review>

I give the front of house staff five stars for their friendliness and helpfulness.

The food I ordered, however, was poor quality. I ordered two baked rolls. The fish topping my rolls was noticeably overcooked. One of the rolls, the "Dynamite Roll", was served underneath a handful of tortilla chips which confused me; I didn't think it worked at all. My husband ordered a roll and he was equally dissatisfied.

For 3 rolls and a can of green tea, we paid $45 (not including a tip), so the price for the quality didn't balance out for us.< /Text>

<review>Wow!!!!! This place looks the same but the food quality has gone down tremendously. I was served tempura which tasted like dirt...literally!!! This used to be my favorite spot but I'm going to have to look elsewhere in the future. we finished eating like 20 minutes ago and are still waiting for the bill.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Service was mediocre at best, felt like we were an inconvenience and we were the only people in the place.  Food wasn't very good, had a weird taste to it.  Won't be back.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Ordered the chicken katsu and shrimp tempura lunch.  The cutlet was over cooked chicken breast that was cooked in old oil.  The katsu was covered in old debris in the oil, leaving the katsu covered in a black, bitter tasting breading.  The gyoza was store bought and the tempura batter lacked rice flour, creating a bisquick like batter.  Miso was good as was the salad, can't screw that up.  All for $15.00< /Review><Name>Tim Osmond</Name>< pictures>

This bar is so nice and drinks are great. Characters Sportsbar is a lovely member of the staff and always takes excellent care of my friends and I. This place is very inviting. Great place for cocktail and a photo op.<//Text>

Fun...fun...fun! That's what "Characters" is all about. It's hoping with a lively crowd.
TV's blazing in every corner...drinks from a full bar...and yummy food (served uniquely) all go toward making this a 5☆ "hang-out"... worth the drive to enjoy.
Wait staff is delightful. Prompt, professional and with a great since of humor, your taken care of properly. They are happy and it shows in the quality of service!
Delightful experience!</text>

<Review>A great Dive Bar. Dorothy is the best bartender, always a delightful smile and she makes the tastiest Sunday brunch.

4 different football games on. Multiple screens. Great beer selection and smoking patio on the side.

No better place to chill.<//Review>< Rating>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>A dive bar with a band or dj. Nothing fancy. But basically where you go to get a beer that's good and not over priced because they have a dance toilet. No you come here to drink or drink to much, maybe mosh or listen to loud bands. Not a place for snobs.</review>< Pictures>

It I could I would give it a 0 stars. I tried to walk in but the bouncer wouldn't let me. I told him I would dispose of my alcoholic beverage beforehand but he still would not let me in. I was not even close to being intoxicated but he refused. Some guy with a beard so beware! I would recommend odonavens before this place without a doubt<//text>

Went there last night.  Great food.  Great drinks.  Amazing.  They have a hip hop show here that brings out the best artists in Southern Cali, which is the best place in the world.  So basically they bring I. The best artists in the world. Shout out to them.  Saw @messykidsofficial (follow them on Instagram) perform, they’re a great rap group. Check out all of their songs.  They have videos on YouTube too.  Subscribe to their channel Messy Kids TV.  They have a dope live show and music with soul and purpose.   If you get messy then you know what’s up.<//text>

Liked it...cool spot..fair prices...but a level pool table and a real throwing line for darts is important to me- but ' What the hell...it's just the rules'.  I do appreciate the steel tip boards and there is a 2ed pool table to play on which may be level...3 stars...ill definitely be back to test the other table, and test that cold 805 on tap again.

Pretty decent bar. I've only been here on nights I'm playing in a band, so I don't know what it's like for regulars. Beer is reasonably priced, and they have a pretty good selection of macro and micro breweries. Sound is actually pretty decent for the small spaces inside and outside. Plenty of room on the patio, and last time I was there it was winter and instead of a band there was a food cart on the patio. We had a burger, it was good. Some people really hate this joint, I think it's just fine. Too far for me to go just to go, it's not really a destination bar.<//Text>

I can't say enough positive about this place.  It's a neighborhood dive for sure, but not filled with depressing drunks.  Instead it's filled with a combination of Bucktown young professionals, and some blue collar workers having an after work drink.

The staff is beyond amazing, and it takes all of two orders with a nice tip to be getting free drinks.  Never once had a bad time going here.  It truly is a place where everybody knows your name.</review>

Great atmosphere, awesome music, service is always good. The bands are badass, the people who are locals are good folks. Beers cheap and there's a smoking patio.</Text>

<review>Nice dive bar. Most people are friendly. Two Billiard tables and a juke box. Prices are alright and there is a barbecue area just outside the bar were they sell food and have live performances. But I don't think this place is the kinda place you wanna go to the bathroom lol<//review>< Name>

WORSE BAR EXPERIENCE EVER, ONLY went for Ca$H Flow$, big white security guard with long hair is super un-professional and super rude, big chunky guy bartender was rude to me after asking if hes allowed to be taking shots with my fiance (on the job) bathrooms are horid well at least the men's bathroom was absolutely disgusting, I'd rather use a port-a-potty, I am currently reaching out to the Better Business Bureau....</review>

<date>1620078153760< /date><Text>Terrible experience. I’m actually embarrassed for what this place has become. Waited 20 min for a seat. Hostess then placed us at the bar. Tender ignored us for 5 min. Served us cola’s in the bottle and made us uncap the drinks ourselves. Yes, a bartender didn’t even open our drinks! I had three tacos two of which where terrible. Carnitas was just boiled to death bland and the fish taco was bland as well. The best thing about it was our food took one hour to come to us. Bartender never checked on it, never inquired, didn’t do anything. Our order consisted of one hamburger, Three tacos. Start to finish we were there for lunch nearly two hours. Completely unacceptable. Covid seems to be code for $&@? Show where prices are high, standards are low but you better support us and tip well! I’m tired of it.</Text>< Rate>

Absolutely delicious. Dined here during their DRK Festival which was a 5-course dinner & beer pairing event. It was incredible. All the food was delicious, and let me tell you there was a lot of it! The photo included in my review was the main course. Each course came with 2 ounce pours of craft beer from Stone Brewing and other local breweries. Each course followed a specific taste theme and was paired with like-beers. Just like there was a lot of food, there was also a lot of beer. Those 2 ounce pours ADD up... so if you ever attend one of these tasting festivals be sure to pace yourself or just taste the beer with the food. Otherwise, you'll walk out feeling... 🥴

Overall, value was great for the quality of food and beer. Definitely recommend checking it out!< /review>

<review>Wow, what a terrible all around experience. My husband loves Stone so I figured it was the perfect place to get his family together for his birthday. Because we were a party larger than 5 I had to call to make a reservation. I called, no one picked up, so I left a message, but no one called me back. 3 days later I called again and someone finally made me a reservation. When it came to the day of, I approached the hostess stand but no one acknowledged me for over a minute. They completely ignored my presence, not even a “I’ll be right with you.” Once we were finally sat, we were placed at a table with a bench. While this is fine for people in their 20’s, I had my 60 year old in laws with me who do not need to be hopping over a bench and eating at a picnic table. Additionally, our table only had one heater but we were at a large table. With only outdoor seating available, I tried to call wave down a waitress to get another heater since one heater obviously did not warm the whole table. However, no one ever came to check on us, so I tried to wave someone down. One waitress completely made eye contact with me while I waived my hand and she ignored me and just walked away. Talk about a slap in the face. Wow! Once I flagged down another staff member, I was told each table could only have one heater. This meant my table of 9 had 1 heater while a 2 person table also got 1. More importantly, there were heaters 50 feet away not in use that could have been brought over. To make matters worse, the food was way too salty for almost everyone’s meal. At the end, my brother in law asked for a box for food and after 10 minutes we finally left with a makeshift wrap for his burger with the wax paper it came in because no one ever came. Lastly, the entire time we were there no one came to check on us or ask how we were. The only time we saw someone was when they were bringing our food and drinks. We used to come here regularly and I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. The worst dining experience and on my husbands birthday. Just pathetic.< /review>< Pictures>

Just went there for lunch yesterday. First, I arrived 5 mins early of my reservation time and was not seated till 20 mins after my reservation time. The table I was seated at had crumps, food and sticky stuff all over it. I asked a waiter for a rag to wipe the table myself, but the waiter never came back. And the beer bottle I received had some kind of dirty paste on the top so I had to request a new one twice because the first waiter forgot to bring a new one. This place used to be one of my favorite places to eat, but now it is severely dropping in quality and is extremely under staffed. I have no problem paying for a nice lunch but I would at least expect the table to be cleaned especially during covid times.</Text>

Best brewery I've ever been to.. We've been to Pasadena Stone and Liberty Station, and although nice, This is our favorite spot.. We even take the kids and the entire family, or sometimes it'll just be for date night or couples night. The atmoshphere here is the best, (not to mention, the beer selection and the amazing food!)we can truly say we have made so much history and memories here. We love Stone Brewing so much, we named our baby, Stone(his middle name). 😎 If you decide to visit, which you should, pace yourself, drink responsibly, relax and enjoy!< /Review>

This is a beautiful place to enjoy a meal with family and friends.  It is too bad the service is horrendous from the moment you walk in the door to when you leave. The onion rings are cold, soggy and overbattered. The hamburger was a little bit warm, not at all as described on the menu. Majority of the toppings on this $17+ burger were missing and the worst part is everything has to be ordered and requested online by you, why go out when you can get better food and service from yourself?!!!< /text>

Stone Brewery, what Happened?  Used to my favorite go to place. Now the food is awful - really bad. The venue and beer are excellent, but  over the last 6 months or so,  the food has gone steadily downhill -  from culinary delights to stale, recooked  and rock hard. My ribs yesterday were uneatable. Did you change your chef? Covid is no excuse for bad food. Hoping for a change.<//review>

We didn't have one heater on, it was FREEZING!! Everyone in the front had two or THREE heaters around their tables and they sat us ALL the way in the back by trees even though there were plenty of tables that were empty closer to the front. There was a FULL cold breeze going through our table and we asked three different waiters to help us light even ONE heater. One rude waitress told to just order more alcohol and we would warm up. *seriously?!*  I had to eat in a huddled position and because I was being treated to dinner I did not want to be rude to my date and keep complaining. He touched my hand a few times and asked me if I wanted to leave because I was THAT cold. We stayed but what a horrible experience. I should also mention that we had made reservations.</text>

Couldn't get a simple napkin or side of ketchup unless you get up and find them. Too make it even better you have to pay and tip prior to getting your food. Not fun typing my credit card number into my phone while other customers walked around looking. Not sure who I tipped 18% for the lack of servers.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf4e41d99764f:0x1570d59d24a1b814< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Beautiful facility attached to the brewery. I agree it can feel touristy but we had a great time regardless. Their kitchen is solid And we enjoyed our meal. I had iron noodles and they were tasty. Food is a little pricy for the portion size. They have a great beer selection with some unique small batch brews that you won’t find anywhere else. All in all this place was fun.< /Text>< user>

It’s a beautiful area but the concept of no servers I find really strange. There were plenty of people working and I think we would’ve had a better experience with a human than the phone. Bring back your servers please!</review>

Beautiful place, great beer, average food, TERRIBLE service.  All our plates were still on the table when they brought desert, grumpy, over-burdened wait staff.  Management needs to get their scene together.<//text>

Beautiful interior, have yet to enjoy the gardens. Food and drinks a little on the pricier side but great pairing options. Beer flights are a great way to taste a variety of what they have. We also tried the Mac n Cheese with Bacon (could have used a litte more bacon) and the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. The sandwich was delicious but honestly could do without the cilantro. I tried a bite and ended up picking them all out. The chips served with it were so amazing that I ended up ordering an extra bowl of it on the side. Overall, service was great and we will definitely be back!</text>

<text>They have a beautiful and expansive outdoor seating area so people are well spaced, and you can even keep some distance within your own party. Ordering is done by scanning a QR code, and while the website is a little finicky, it worked to reduce the traffic and ordering and payment was all contactless. Service was exceptionally fast. Don't expect to walk in and mill around. You're restricted to your table and they do a good job reducing any crowding.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dbf4e41d99764f:0x1570d59d24a1b814</GmapID></record>

I'm from out of town (Minnesota) and I wasn't aware of the reservation rules so when I found out I was a bit heartbroken. The hosts went out of their way to help me to see if I could get a seat. I loved your beer way before I ever came to visit and I wanted to enjoy your garden. Thank you for making this a wonderful experience!

Their food is just as tasty as the beer! I will always recommend Stone!< /review>

<UserId.>111399572952755943659<//UserId.><Review>This place is a ghost of what it used to be.

Sure, I get Covid has forced some changes to all businesses, but this place takes the cake for mediocrity and nonsense.

Went there yesterday: "sorry, it is now by reservation only." "Without reserve, the earliest I can something available is 9:15" - I went there at 5ish.

On a prior trip, about a month ago, I had spent at least 20 mins. setting up my personal information to order the one single beer I ordered along with a new veggan, despicable Indian food.

Selection of beers are no where near where it just to be.

Food changes are horrid.

Someone needs to, in a hurry, change the dynamics of this place and bring it back to where it was.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Time>

Really cool place.  Awesome atmosphere and good food.
There are tons of beers to try and the food is amazing.  The burgers and smashed potatoes are delicious.</review>

< review>
I've been here a handful of times & it's been great each time. They have just the right amount of it all going on here for a brewery. Lots to see & explore here. It is located a little off the beaten path but that makes it feel more exclusive in my opinion. Also, a lot of really great selections for beer of course! The quail legs are SO delicious, & the menu has plenty more choices too. Thx y'all</review>

<Review>I generally love the experience Stone and have dined here many times. The menu has consistently improved in the 5 years we have lived in the area and I am glad to see them coming back after C-19. However, the new web based self-ordering system, gotab.io, is a disaster on several levels. First, it takes too long to create an account. 2nd, they are an unknown entity to me and I don't like giving my credit card and mobile phone number out to unknown parties who do not have a well known security record. 3rd, you cannot easily make special requests on the order because the comment box is limited to about 20 characters; 4th, I had a coupon that could not be applied automatically - fortunately the manager, Liz, was very helpful and got it processed. 5th and most importantly - it is a BAD look for a quality place like Stone to use a 3rd party app that charges each user a $0.25 'convenience fee' - not a lot of money, just feels cheap and it is was for THEIR convenience, not mine. While I understand the need to be creative in the post C-19 world, I fear apps like this are really taking jobs away from wait staff (although the app still defaults to a 20% gratuity to simply bring food to me) and takes away from the experience. I can't talk to a server, get recommendations, hear about specials, make special requests, or have any human experience. If I want fast food, I can go elsewhere. Oh by the way gotab.io also has a review and rating section, so they are a threat to OpenTable as well. Bring back human servers please! Finally, I have to comment on the policing of guests. We unfortunately sat next to a table of 4 women and 2 young children, the latter of which ran around the grounds with no supervision, yelling all the while. A restaurant is not a playground, and I think the staff should be allowed to ask parents to monitor their children so that others can enjoy their meals.<//Review>< Time>

Most of their beers are IPAs, so if you don't like IPAs this isn't the place for you. Sat at the bar and customer service could definitely use some improvement. Souvenir pint glasses were also under $4 which was nice.< /text>< Date>

This is a favorite place for my wife and I. Last time we went I tried The impossible burger and it was fantastic! If you want to try a vegetarian option then I would highly recommend it! The texture of the "burger" was similar to one done medium rare and the flavor was great. I will say that any bite with a pepper in it was about twice as good as one without. Another person in our party ordered it with the recommended beer pairing and said that they really did complement each other. In any case, you can't go wrong with the options here!< /text>

Nice restaurant but nothing special, even felt too touristy, not a brewery. And pricey. Beer was good but leaning toward the average. Among those seven or so we tried, Mosaic was 👍 good. In short I would prefer some places like Unsung in Anaheim or Institution Ales in Camarillo over this bistro.<//review>

Was excited to visit from Seattle to experience a proper California brewery. What a disappointment. The Good: The property was beautiful with a huge garden. The beer was good but not exceptional.I had a sampler of the IPA's... The Bad: The prices are exorbitant. A beer for nine dollars at the brewery is not expected. When you drink at a brewery you expect that you’re buying your beer from the manufacture and the cost will be lower than a third-party bar or restaurant. The food prices were expensive as well. We left the restaurant with my wife still hungry. We will never come again. We have much better expectations from breweries where we live. Stone brewery is definitely a tourist trap.< /text>

Be ready for alot of kids out in the garden on the weekends but it is a well put together place.  Food is a little pricy but yummy.  Beer selection always on point and be careful of the merch shop, it is dangerous on the wallet Haha. Layout is very well thought out, the noise cancelling is on point in the main restaurant and tours are always fun.  My wife complained about the heavy door in the women's bathroom not letting you tell if someone is actually in the stall or not.< /Review>

Been here twice. First time was fine.  Came second time for lunch and receptionist let another customer cut in front of me when I literally was standing in front of her.  Other customer apologized after talking for almost 5 minutes.  Receptionist and manager apologized but no table since 45 minute wait. Needless to say, will never go back</Text>

<Text>I already loved this beer, (it's the best) but I will get an extra point for their tour guide Alex, thank you very much I enjoyed the tour very much...the food was very good buuuut Stone already had reservations and let other people take those reserved tables and then they have to move the people to another free table... That's not necessary, the only thing you have to do is put a sign of "reserved" or something like that in those tables and the problem will be solve<//Text>< time>

<Text>You'll need to make reservations, otherwise you'll be waiting a long time for a table, and if they're really busy there's a possibility of not being seated at all. This place is beautiful! The food is amazing, (try the brussel sprouts, you'll love them!) the service is outstanding, and the prices are great! They grow and source all of their food locally (making for the freshest ingredients) and their food is GMO free and/or organic. They update their menu often and theres something for every taste. You can choose to dine inside or out...if you choose to dine outside the views of their garden are very pretty. If you get the chance, walk the garden. It's very charming, their Coi pond is enchanting, plus there are many little nooks and crannies to sit and have a romantic conversation.</Text>< response>

<Text>Parking is terrible.  Then you get inside and the girl at the counter is not very helpful, like worthless.  The food was average, the kids menu better.  The charcuterie board was so disappointing.  For $21.00 you could see more board than food.  What a mistake to order.  The garden and the koi were beautiful.  This place is definitely overpriced.  I will not be returning.  One big issue is not having reservations.  Forget it if you don't have them.  They could not accommodate a group of 9 although only one half of the place was being used.  The rest was reserved.  Out of the 3 tables around us being reserved: 3 people showed up for a table of 6 and 2 people showed up for a table of 4.  The other one remained vacant.  If they would have accommodated us we would have been together instead of being split.  Such a huge disappointment.  Too bad the garden and koi didn't make up for this experience.  On a good note, the wait staff were great.</Text>< Pics>

A bit pricey, but you can't get better beer in San Diego county. The atmosphere is also amazing,  and the food is generally good too.</Text>

In other words, it is cheaper and more delicious than Hanta,
Above all, the staff are so very friendly. I need to get more out of these shops. ^^ I ordered 4 out of 3 people and ate them well and came out with a tip of 80 $.
Besides, the advantage of being able to take a walk is .. !!!!
Best!!!!!!!!!!!

The staff are friendly and the food is sooooooo delicious. perfect :)

여기 진짜 좋아요!!!!
까 놓고 말해서 한타보다 저렴하고 맛있고,
무엇보다 직원들이 너무너무너무 친절합니다. 이런 가게는 더 더 흥해야 돼요.^^ 3명이서 4개 시켜서 배부르게 잘 먹고 팁 포함해서 80$ 나왔어요.
거기다가 산책도 할 수 있다는 장점이..!!!!
최고!!!!!!!!!!!

There is also a vegetarian menu, and my favorite pretzel was authentic and delicious ~ ♪

First of all this place is AMAZING! I really don’t understand why this has a rating of 3.7 like their drinks are bomb. The people there are so nice and their cups and straws are so detailed! I give this a 5/5!</review>

<Review>Nope. Don't go here. Both my friend and myself came here for the first time and the drinks were horribly made. Mine didn't even get mixed well (and wouldn't mix in) since they put too much brown sugar. Even at 100% (regular) sweetness, they probably put in 3x the amount needed. The boba texture and taste was really bad too. I wouldn't recommend going here at all.</Review><time>1573677343851<//time>< pictures>

< review>
Went to the store at 9:40pm and the store hours are until 10:00pm but the girl inside will not open the door or even bother telling customers that she decided to close it early. There were other customers waiting outside too. If the store sign says open until 10:00 pm customers would be think that you are open to customers until 10 not that the employee closes 30 minutes before the closing time. This is so unprofessional. Maybe store should specify that the store is open until 10 but service only provided until 9:30. Website has a closing time of 11pm and there is a had written sign posted right below showing new times but I think management made a mistake. The new closing time should be 9:30pm instead of 10.</review>

<Text>Stood in line for over 20 minutes to get a smoothie and finally got to the register to be told they were out of smoothies that day. They couldn't post a sign? Or announce that to make sure customers weren't wasting their time in that long line. I actually ordered food before attempting to order the smoothies. And had them cancel the whole order because the only reason we went was it was my daughters birthday and she really wanted a smoothie from there. If they don't respect their customers time they won't get any of my business.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>most of the experiences I've had here have been good. The boba tea is good and for a good price. One thing I do not like is that they sometimes allow a homeless man to come in and harass the customers. Other than that, the service is quick and the food tastes good.</Review>< pictures>

This place is pretty good from my personal experience so far. I haven't ever had a bad experience with the drinks, service, or food. The food is decent, but the drinks in my opinion are amazing. So far, I've had the Apple slush, lemon slush, and cookies n cream milkshake and they've all been amazing.</review>

Ordered a honey dew rose tea, received a honey rose tea. I didn’t complain because I understand how that could get mixed up. However the drink turned out to be wayyy to sweet and not enjoyable. Unfortunately, I didn’t like anything else about the experience to merit a second chance.</review>

I come here for the convenient location and reasonable prices. Boba milk tea is a basic and I give it a 7.5 out of 10. The matcha green tea gets a 6. It had an akward flavor and the powder was actually in  clumps. I took a swig and found out the hard way how bitter it can be. If you're looking for boba on a budget I would recommend.</Text>

Their drinks aren't that great since they are a syrup based place. With only one person working behind the counter and another working in the kitchen, there is always a long wait time. The only redeeming thing about Quickly is their popcorn chicken, but that isn't enough to get me to come here. This is coming from a person who only lives 4 blocks away from here. Just go to a Union City for milk tea. Many more options.< /review>

This place is the home of my comfort food and drinks. They're not the best in town, they don't seem to be aiming for that, but they are reliable when it comes to taste. It reminds me of the times when I was in middle school, broke, and hungry. And there was nothing better than a sugar-filled jasmine milk tea that you bought with the $3 you had left. This place always lifts my spirits after a long day and the craving for boba is real. And here in Hayward this is the place. No frills, just good drinks and warm food. Anything fancier than that really doesn't fit the Hayward scene that I know.<//text>

<Text>First and last time going here. I love boba tea and was excited to try Quickly, but no, just NO!! Everyone was so rude and the tea wasn’t even what I ordered. I regret coming here and wish I could get the last 30 minutes of my life back. The tea is bad and the “customer service” is even worse! Do yourself a favor and don’t even bother stopping here. You’ll thank me later.< /Text>< pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>This Quickly has the best tasting drinks vs other Quicklys I've been to, but they are always out of the large Tapioca!! How can a Tapioca place run out?? They have poor service as well, they don't care to leave you standing in line, they wont tell you they run out until you order. I've witness many people walk out angry because they waited for nothing. Twice they have been out on large and small tapioca, that's ridiculous considering it's a Tapioca place! And the worst is that they said various times they don't recommend the small tapioca, but they offer it when they run out the large (most asked for tapioca). It just doesn't make sense! They don't apologize either! I don't get it! That was the last time I am going! After 5 consecutive times I went when I was craving them this happened!<//text><Name>Jully Marquez< /Name>< Time>

<Text>Most cringy customer service and experience ever. While we were in line the worker(female) was helping another customer and was providing them free drinks ‘on her’. The worker also took an awful long time assisting them with just 2 drinks and had a loud nonstop conversation with them as well (as it was her friend). 10 awkward minutes later she finally greeted us and helped us. A couple minutes after, there came more of her friends which she also provided free drinks too. She told them the drinks would be free and to ‘text her’ what they wanted. While making our drinks she also had an awkward conversation with the boys about how one girl just quit because she was always calling in at quicklys and how a new girl they know is about to be hired. The new girl was apparently fu***d by one of their friends: “yeah her the one that got f***** by *****” were her words to the boys in front of us. She also kept saying bruh this bruh that out loud, non stop. Never have I felt so uncomfortable and awkward in my life. She also used a lot of bad words in Spanish, which I don’t know why she would in a work place? Calling the boys in there after us “mierda” and a bunch of other bad words and laughing at it(however the boys seemed to like it, since they knew each other). Overall very unprofessional  experience where the people there before us and after us got free drinks. I should’ve got a free drink too after hearing who had sex with who! Not professional at all👎🏻 My visit at this quicklys across Chabot College was on Friday June 8th around 9:30 pm<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I just can't wrap my mind around that excuse! I mean okay if it happens once or twice but so many times i go here they are out of this and that and its kind of a dread because every other quicklys is fully stock no matter what day or how busy it is.
That is just downright unappealing and brings a damp over quicklys name.

Yeah the place is nice and all but it doesn't deter the fact that they are always giving excuses of what they are out of.

Hopefully they can turn this place around because everything else is fine except for that particular detail. But how can everything be great when they are out of it?!

Good luck and i wish the best for this business but they have to keep up their standards in how they do business and always be on top of things to keep their customers from being disappointed majority of the time<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808f91498dd6ec07:0x3f8ffc53dbdc47ad</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Cashier was sassy and rude towards customers. Ordered lychee milk tea, gave me sesame milk tea. Gave it back, showed them the receipt, and they gave me lychee jelly instead of boba, and had to pay 50 cents to add boba. Would not recommend. Drinks are okay...</Review>

It is just awful! Compared to tapioca express and itea, their popcorn chicken lacks flavor! Their milk teas aren't as good either! There's long wait times, and only one cashier register along with one kitchen worker!<//Review>

I was pleasantly surprised that this location carried what I was looking for, namely Raised and Rooted brand and Beyond Breakfast Sausage. It was well maintained and cleaned too. Quick and plenty self-checkout lanes.<//Text>

Fairly clean place. Has everything you may need but it's a small store so it doesn't have everything a store can offer. Good service, polite workers.</review>

<text>Seriously ... whose bright idea was it to build a Walmart with only two cash registers? The self checkout lanes are no better. Lines are always so long. God help you if you need liquor or toiletries as many of the items are locked. You push a button for a sales associate to open the case for you and it takes them forever to get there. That is if they even bother to show up at all. A good place to shop if you have all the time in the world. Otherwise, I suggest you shop elsewhere.<//text><UserId.>117703783152140933230< /UserId.><response>None</response><Pics>None< /Pics>< rate>

I like this store for groceries. Its closer to my house than the super walmart is so when I just need to pick up items like food and cleaning supplies, I choose to go there. It always seems to be really busy. But even when the line is long, their self checkout is pretty quick.<//Review>

Im not a Big Fan of this store but the location is convenient. They never have the items or products I'm looking for. But I have to remember this is not a Super Center it's just a grocery store with very little essentials that One may need ib</review>

<Text>1 half asleep customer service employee.  Loooong line of people.
Tried two different days. Finally just stood in line for 1 HOUR

Walmart work on your customer service...for goodness sake, just pull that half asleep person stocking the shelves when there's a surge.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I had no mask and I asked if I can have one and the worker by the door had no problem taking his time and brought me a mask from the back cause there was no more in the front. Customer service was great 👍< /text>

Stepped up with keeping shelves stocked. Frequently the public restrooms are up to clean standards. A few months back they added more self-checkout stations. So the cashier power was reduced...creating long lines at those registers. All and all a good place to shop. If you like to be RIPPED OFF BY SAM WALTON AND COMPANY!!!< /review>

It's ok,  lots of people wearing masks, jus does not have lots of offerings. Low stock, small choice of wat brand, and the women's shoes are very ugly, not a big selection, never my size which is eight and half. Then the woman's clothing section needs improvement. Cuter choice of clothing for plus size women..........and then there is checkout and check cashing sigh......it takes forever</Review>

Usually over crowded since there aren't many grocery stores in the area. Or possibly, its the lower prices that draw in the crowds. Either way, be ready to wait in a long line.

<Text>Its the lines that get me. I waste more time waiting in line than I do the shopping. Whether that is self check out or someone ringing me out. Usually I'm in and out and only need a few things, but I wait at least 10 or more minutes. either a machine is down or they have 2 cashiers.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Nice employees and helpful. So cool inside I could shop and breathe. Thank you. Line's way too long to check out 6-9 people in line each lane 1 checker. Not enough. Plenty on the floor to stock not enough at check out to help. Had to run back to get another item due to the sku number incomplete. Line waited etc. Sad. Other wise great! Clean also except bathroom.< /Review><Time>1597529743330</Time></record>

Was in line for over a half hour- must have been at least 30 people in line for the customer service desk. They only had one lady working the counter but numerous other employee's were just bee- boppin' around with seemingly nothing to do- ya think one of them would have come and helped that poor woman all by herself at the customer service desk. Will nev
er go again if I can help it.< /text>

This is the dirtiest walmart I have ever visited. They are severely understaffed and the lines to checkout are frequently all the way to the back of the store. I have tried many times to give this walmart my support  and after yesterday I will never step inside this store again.</Text>

< review>
I am writing to commend the amazing customer service provided by the store manager at Walmart on Marconi. I work for an organization that supports people with disabilities and was informed that when one of our clients was there recently, they found themselves in the unfortunate circumstance of not having the funds to fully pay for their purchase.  The manager of the store paid for the purchaser out of his own pocket much to the surprise and delight of the customer. I would like to personally thank and commend the management of Walmart for their outstanding  customer service.< /review>

Hard to find help, but usually stocked and I can find what I need. I was waiting for over 30 minutes for an associate to assist me, with four other people waiting at the same place as I. Went to three different people before I had to interrupt someone helping someone else to get what I needed.<//Review>

Last night was my last stop I had a fad a fabulous day
The checker was the rudest by far i have experienced at this location and she was in the management team.
Very desturbing.
I do multiple shopping for our Seniors. Duly note my business will not be at this Walmart Neighborhood Market on Marconi.
All the Walmart stories heard about Customers
Everyone has one
The Service recieved shouldn't be the source. Bad service should be fired so they really can be rude.<//Review>< Pictures>

The Wal-Mart on Marconi near Howl avenue  is a no-frills store. I've been going to this Wal-Mart for 10 years or more. On occasion I've shopped at Safeway and Raileys stores and was blown away at how different and nice they looked compared to my ol" Wal-Mart. Don't get me wrong! I like different and nice as much as the next shopper. But I've worked so hard to know where every item I could possibly want or need is. I even look forward to saving some other shoppers day by telling them exactly where what their looking for is. I still catch myself visiting they're competitors stores from time to time.< /text>

Great go-to for groceries, but there are limited  checkstands and the self checkout stations are faulty. Prepare to spend 10-minutes checking out once you have found what you are looking for.< /text>

It's the closest to my home. Shelves are never fully stocked. My favorite checkout lady has got a job at this one. She's the only one I allow to check me out. She's friendly and very responsible in what should be packed together. Love her and she's the best thing about this store. Please stock your shelves fully.< /Review>

<user>104117687854905629302<//user><Text>Convenient local. Try to get in early to beat the crowd before noon or at least before 3. Not the biggest so they have a smaller selection here, so beware that. If you like to do most of your monthly shopping though I would suggest a different Walmart Grocery location with a bigger store, but its great if you forgot that little something for dinner.<//Text></record>

Just went in for a birthday card and some scratcher tickets. Found the perfect card, but the ticket machine was out of all the inexpensive tickets. Got what I needed, though.< /Text>

Always overcrowded and understaffed!

Every time I have been here there has been some extreme delay (10-30 minutes) due to the lack of enough employees.<//review>

This place is awful. Seriously. I avoid it at all costs. It is always so busy, but it wouldn't be so bad if it were a bigger place...but it is not. The lines go through the aisles do you can barely move around in the store at all.
Everything is locked up, so you constantly need to ask for help to get items. The employees are nice, but that's about the only good thing that I can say. The only reason that I have recently been there is to pick up a medication from the pharmacy. And even that was an adventure.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Needed to find my daughters fiance who worked here. Went to customer service counter to ask where he was. Stood at the counter for a good 5 minutes or more watching 4 employees talking to each other. Not one said anything to me, no "hello, we will be right with you", each of them looked at me, saw me standing, obviously needing service, and completely ignored me. No customer service what so ever. Worst Walmart, and thats saying something.  Will NOT shop at Walmart ever again<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The first thing that I noticed was the automatic gate that is installed at the entrance, it only opens one way so I soon gathered that it was to prevent people from exiting in that direction. I brought my friend here to find a couple of items and was disturbed by what I can best describe as a prison atmosphere. The gate that opens one way, the excessively large monitor hovering above the checkout area that surveys the entire store, and the men guarding the check out area and exit. It is not welcoming at all, and I would not recommend this particular store for the reasons that I shared.< /review>

most of the self checkout stands for closed, only three cashiers working in a huge line of customers. Cashiers were moving slow at best.</review>

<Review>Crowded. Full of dirtballs. And based on the number of people in the customer service line trying to pay their bills, I will assume these people don't have any sort of bank account in which they can make electronic payments or they are in danger of getting something turned off, like their power, cable or getting a vehicle repossessed or something of that nature.

if you want to just pick up a few items and use self-checkout, then it is not so bad. But remember, it is Walmart.... Need I say more?<//Review>< pics>

The customer service line is regularly backed up and around in front of the pharmacy. Ive been in the line for 25 minutes and no one is clued into the customer service element that is absent from this line. Not sure why the reps at the counter have no idea how to expeditiously conduct business for the sake the customer service line.</text>

90% of the time they have what I need & I can go in & get out pretty fast with self checkout. Absolutely love the fact they have a Pharmacy! VERY convenient!<//text>

Convenient , close to home , but  self checkout is the way to go under a certain amount of groceries. Seems prices are lower , maybe obsevation. Not as stock as supercenter walmart but has mostly what I need.<//review>

3.o stars...If not for the long check out lanes, getting assistance out on the floor due to several items listed on shelves at one price but skd tag at another(higher)price.It would give the rating 3.5 or almost a 4.0 The customer service of those who came to help when they did show up it made all the difference in how frustrated i was.. #1store leaders need to make sure products on shelves match the price on the shelves and is in the right spot. #2continue to be friendly,curtious,and timley when a customer needs help on floor.The attitudes and their smiles make a big difference.#3Get customer service counter more efficient.Once you reach the cashier its quick.Its getting to the cashier that is "BAD."Spending 20-30min in line is crazy</Text>

I go here all the time cuz they shut down the one closest to me. The money center line is almost always at least a half hour wait. Everything else is decent, if your using self checkout it is suprisingky fast believe it or not. Will be back but if there was one closer I'd go there, this one is used only out of necessity<//Review>

< review>
I shop here once or twice a month. Store is usually well stocked but been there a few times that it wasn't. Could use a couple more mobility scooters ASAP. Men's bathroom could use a bit more attention and one of the sinks needs fixing. I need to use  one of those scooters  from time to time too. I have found the employees to be very friendly and helpful in finding items or getting the right price of something. I appreciate the employees personal attention they give to me even when they're busy. Overall I am very satisfied every time I visit  this store and have made this store my home store now for the last 4 years. 👍👍< /review>

This store is a smaller size of the bigger Wal-Marts. Its mostly a grocery store with some non food items included. Give it a try you may like it.<//Review>

Wouldn't cash my money order, waited in line 25 minutes for them to deny me. Because I had proof of where the money order came from and the date of purchase and the former purchase. Now if I did not have that how would the situation would have went?< /text>

Never again! I'd tell you what is wrong but dont have that much patience to go into detail. You would think it would be cleaner, faster, better selection as they are competing with 4 other grocery stores within walking distance but bad.... REALLY BAD!<//Text>

The staff does its best to provide good shopping experience,  but this location has obstacles in this area. High theft,and the lines are long as Walmart appears to be phasing out real people to check out groceries and push self checkout. Because of the abundance of people shopping here, they frequently are out of stock of many basic items and or have large pallets of food on the sales floor being restocked or moving from one area to another. I try to avoid this location as much as possible. Clearly not the employees doing but a Corporate issue within Walmart that needs to be reassessed.</text>

Worst Walmart ever.. people fighting in the parking lot, people asking you to buy their food stamps inside the store, never any carts or hand baskets, bare shelves most of the time.. They're always out of essentials & I'm always left wishing I went to the winco down the road.. don't waste your time or money..<//text>

Getting better, healthier choices and products in, thank you for that.... but so much of the shelves are empty! Why? I wish the employees were more friendly. This is the least friendly cashier bunch I've ever encountered. 😟</Text>

Shoppers do not maintain safe distance,  and no Walmart recordings to warn customers,  and certain disreputable  types get upset when you ask them  to maintain  6 feet appart, and respect your personal space.</Review>

Why are so many products locked up these days? I wanted a diabetic related item, but had to track down an employee, who had to go get the key to unlock the case. Once the items were removed, I was told they would be held at a certain register until I was ready to check out. The check out area is a nightmare. There are two registers to the lane where my items were, one self check out, one regular, but there isn't enough room to pass the first one to get to the second one, especially if you're in an electric cart, like I was. You can't even tell which register the people are waiting for. While I was driving around, looking for a way to get to the register where my items were, a nice employee offered to help me, but even that got confusing as to where she wanted me to go, and how to get there. In all the confusion, I had to leave my 92 year old aunt (whom I was supposed to be helping) in her line, so I could purchase my items at a different register. Too much hassle. Don't plan on returning any time soon.</text>

I like their selection. I accidentally forgot a bag of groceries and the guy behind me was nice enough to run out and tell me just as I was about to take off. Was really grateful, it had my most expensive purchases in it.<//Review>

<text>I shop here twice a month or more. The price is reasonable, but there is usually a wait for the lines for both self checkout and regular checkout. Customer service line is extremely long if you go during the afternoon. Some items I’m not able to return because I purchased it in a regular Walmart store and they don’t carry the item. I would have to visit the Walmart elsewhere. This place is small, but you get what you need in the store.
You have to call someone to get the cosmetic for you since it is locked. I don’t think the button next to the cosmetic works at all. I pressed more than five times and no one comes to grab the item. The employees are usually busy with other customer and take a long time to come and grab the cosmetics. Also after the employee grabs the item, they put it in the register. You will get your item when you checkout.<//text>< Pics>

Never enough staff.Long lines to checkout.Shelves are never stocked.Its called SUPPLY AND DEMAND ! Heavy customer traffic(demand) yet they cannot keep the products available.
Customer service area always has a very long line.Only 1 employee ???? Why ??
From peak time "10am -8 pm
two employee's is absoutley necessary.
Save yourself a headache.....do not visit this location.<//review>< pics>

Few weeks ago my mother locked herself out of her van. I came to help but I wasn’t able to do much. That’s when Alberto showed up, mind you he was in the middle of doing something else, he helped us open the van within minutes. All the while talking on walkytalky doing his actual job. I appreciate this dude he is a great selfless employee!</text>

It's nice to be able to get things at Walmart prices. However , the disgusting cigarette smoke that comes in while waiting in line is horrible. The store could be a little cleaner. The employees are almost ALWAYS yelling from across the store talking about how drunk or high they got the night before. Most of the cashiers are super nice and very patient. I appreciate that.<//review>

<review>I bought something online. It didn't worl. I took it today and the staff is not trained well to handle a simple task as putting store credit on a gift card. I was there 40 minutes 2 leads or in charge people later and still could not figure it out. I was told to go to a Supercenter to get it returned. I am disabled and when I was able to purchase onlineband pick up at my neighborhood Walmart I was happy. Its hard for me to get around.

This used to be a neighborhood store  before the store on El Camino closed. The store was not built nor are item's stocked for the amount of traffic that shops there. Its either a hit or miss experience with this store.  Sometimes items are stocked that I  need, most times not, sometimes handicapped parking is available most times not. I try to avoid shopping there like a plague and before I do, I pray and hope. The employees do the best they can while working under staffed, its not their fault for the long wait in line.< /Review>

Omg... this place is the worst.  Every "the people of Walmart" meme you've ever seen is brought to reality here.  The checkers are rude and the producer is sub par.  I definitely would not gamble on the meat products here either.  The milk is gross, like it was allowed to get too warm.  The prices are good, but only at great cost to quality and environment and customer service.  I am definitely not a fan.<//review>

<Review>DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!!!! I was at register 1 last night around 1045ish and I ASSUME that there was a loss prevention staff that wanted to accuse publicly a customer that was behind me with her basket of stealing.  this sorry employee was so loud and disrespectful that he blocked my movement from putting my food on the conveyor belt and walking up to pay for my items!!! he was so disgusting that he was yelling at the top of his voice accusing the woman of stealing and HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK ME TO JOIN IN SHAMING THIS WOMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT GOT WORSE WHERE HE ATTEMPTED TO BLOCK HER FROM LEAVING WHICH IN TURN BLOCKED OTHER CUSTOMERS FROM LEAVING THE STORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE LATER DECIDED TO ALLOW AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS TO ASK THEM TO CONTINUE TO SHAME THIS WOMAN FROM STEALING!!!!!!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO LOSS PREVENTION QUIETLY ASKING A PERSON ACCUSED TO COME WITH THEM????? THIS IDIOT BLOCKED THE EXIT SO MUCH UNTIL I WENT THROUGH THE ENTER DOOR!!!! OTHER CUSTOMERS STOPPED AND WAS WATCHING THIS DEBACLE!!!!!! I WILL NEVER EVER EVER SHOP WITH WALMART AGAIN!!!!!! OH AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, I JUST SPOKE TO THE MANAGER, SHE STATED THAT SHE WILL LET THE STORE MANAGER KNOW HOWEVER SHE DID NOT ASK FOR MY CONTACT INFORMATION, NOTHING TO COMPENSATE FOR MY EXPERIENCE AT THIS LOCATION.  THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED?!???<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x809ad97f430d01db:0xd0a7b7b4b8d17393<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Waited for assistance with a locked cell phone charger display almost 25 minutes. This was after asking two different supervisors for help. Then spent another ten minutes to check out. We actually could use a larger neighborhood Walmart, this location often runs out of items. It's convenient but customer service gets two stars, but hey... it's Walmart!
The store has the basic supermarket amenities. Not much for speed of service... the parking lot is well lit, and they do have a small customer service counter.< /review>

Shelves are never stocked properly. Has gone from being a decent place to pick up groceries to my least favorite place to go.  They have some very helpful employees but also have some employees that need lessons in customer service.</Text>

It's the neighborhood market part if Walmart.  Fast in and out if you self-check, but if you don't, or if you have beer or wine, California makes it illegal to self-check.  Funny thing -- hard liquor has its own checkout off away from the other checkouts.<//Review>

Since the location at Watt and El Camino has closed this is now my go to Walmart. The staff is nice and shelves are in pretty good shape. Some areas like household cleaners tend to be sparse. But as a whole I enjoy shopping at this location.< /review>

<name>andrea perkins</name><review>I went to the Walmart Neighborhood Market because the Walmart I usually go to was closed permanently. I like the flavored water brand that Walmart carries. Specifically the Fuji Apple flavor. On the day I went there weren't any of the Fuji Apple flavor. In addition the twelve packs of strawberry flavor were also not on the shelves. It was a disappointment.< /review><time>1527317215824<//time><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< Rate>

<Text>This "neighborhood Walmart" is nice and convenient especially for quick in and out matters. There's not a lot of traffic here compared to the "Super Walmart's", naturally there's way more to choose from, but it's nice to be able to quickly go into a grocery store and get out and on your way. Also there's a strip mall right across the street with Ross, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Trader Joe's, and more!<//Text>< Pics>

<Name>andrea perkins< /Name><Text>I went to the Walmart Neighborhood Market because the Walmart I usually go to was closed permanently. I like the flavored water brand that Walmart carries. Specifically the Fuji Apple flavor. On the day I went there weren't any of the Fuji Apple flavor. In addition the twelve packs of strawberry flavor were also not on the shelves. It was a disappointment.</Text><UserId.>111751662517950873410< /UserId.>< GmapID>

Since the location at Watt and El Camino has closed this is now my go to Walmart. The staff is nice and shelves are in pretty good shape. Some areas like household cleaners tend to be sparse. But as a whole I enjoy shopping at this location.< /review>

One cashier for a line that spread back to the freezer isle.  Their solution was pulling people from said line over to the self checkstands. I was quite offended by the stockers using foul language with children clearly in the immediate area.  Repeated foul language...discusting.   One stocker made it clear to me with heavy sigh and body language that I annoyed him trying to go into the isle he was working on.<//review>

< Review>
Today I was in the neighborhood market on Marconi Ave. One of the employees signaled to another employee pointing at me as to say keep your eyes on that guy. Like I was going to steal something. That kind of thing has happened before in the same store. I know people do steal from that store, because I've seen them do it. But I'm not a thief, and there isn't anything that I have to steal. It's very insulting. I guess I'll have to let him, the employee, know the next time I'm in that store that I'm not the thief he obviously assumes that I am. Not all black people are criminals and thieves.<//Review>

It's Walmart which means a Love/Hate relationship. Its nice to go to a store that has everything you have ever wanted, but didnt need. It's over crowded...lines are always a nightmare and the staff do not want to be there; but it does have exactly what you dont need< /review>

< Review>
Why do I always see them stoking the shelves but every single time they are always out of 90% of what I want. They are always way too busey with lines going to the back of the store and half the time I can't even get to what I want to becsuse They have their box's in the way. Also half the store is locked up and the last thing I want to do is ask some guy to unlock the case so I can get my feminine wipes< /Review>

<Text>Usually a quick check out even if there are a lot of people.  Parking lot often messy, but that is more about the neighborhood.  Wal Mart prices in a smaller store that is an easier in and out.< /Text>< Pics>

It's always dirty here and busy. Just sweap up some garbage please and thank you especially in the parking lot! Make your store inviting and make it clean. Just because the products are cheaper here does not mean your store has to look cheap too. Also, smile to your customers. Nobody smiles anymore now a days.<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>This walmart is one of the places that i hate most. I shopped here for almost 2 hours and when i was checking out the guy cashier rang me up and i told him to split my transactions coz i have coupons. Ended up calling a CSM which this  Customer service leader came up and doesnt wanna override the coupons i totally understand. So they cancelled the whole transaction and we had to begin again but when she was ringing me up you can tell she hated coupons the way shes slowly ringing up 1 by 1. Very slow.. i told her nicely maam i dont have enough time coz ive been here pretty much 3 hrs already. She just suddenly cancelled the transaction and it was embarrassing coz i was there already quite long. I asked them to call the manager and this other guy kept telling me that she was the manager but shes not coz it says on her name tag customer service leader. Obviously they dont want to call the manager, the feeling when i left here is not right i cried coz of humiliation. I was couponing for food and ended up going home wd none. I hope this wouldn't happen to anyone. The Cs leader here is a RACIST! Very rude and very not appropriate. Hate this place everytime i drove by it i can feel the same feeling i had that day.<//review>< Pictures>

This store is run very poorly...the customer service is horrible...their food items are expired & out of date...the fruit is bitter...& everytime I come to this store to cash my check...it's always a wait...they are always extremely super slow...& the workers move like they hate their job...but yet they're so quick to get in everyone's else's business when it comes to gossip...smh its like this store is full of drama...with no sense of real motivation...</Review>

<Text>I like this place. It's not that everything is great nor that everything is super cheap, but they have some things here that are really really good. And in many cases prices that are really hard to beat. Plus it's fast -- easy to get into -- easy to get out of.</Text><resp>None<//resp><Name>Harry Littell<//Name><userid>114516904608212246870</userid>< pictures>

I usually go to this store first thing in the morning because I don't like crowds. I realize not everyone can do that, but early morning...staff is always friendly and busy. Today though, I had to go here around noon to get some stamps, and it was crazy packed. Anyway, I was waiting in customer service when I observed a customer berating and speaking abusively to an employee because she had to wait in line.😑 The employee continued to respond professionally and with class, even after the threats. Please tell me Sharon is getting paid more than minimum wage. My 5 star is because she handled the situation better than I think most would. Keep it up Sharon.</text>

<Review>I actually like the store the only problem I have is that it's always too busy and there aren't enough people checking out the customers. Plus they usually end up putting long time locals out of business an individual really liked the Save Mart that closed down after they couldn't beat their prices.. Sad:(</Review>< gmap_id>

Its always well stocked and clean but mostly the variety of gender and age is a plus it seems to work extremely well at this corner store Walmart and everyone in the store plays a professional yet cheerful friendly manner .they all have a smile and always there to assist customers making shopping at walmart a pleasant experience .<//text>

The store is a mess, they almost never have any carts near the doors and you have to go into the parking lot to get one. The cashier's are slow and there's usually only two cashier's open so the lines back up down the isles. Even self check out. If at all possible stay away from this store!!!<//review>

Horrible everytime. Workers are so slow moving they show they don't care. 3 employees in the parking lot and one in her car on break while the only 2 registers are having back to back issues with pricing and customers. They need quicker moving employees who actually want to help.</Text>

This Walmart Store is for grocery only. Very slow lines at register. It look 30 minutes to get to the register, with only three people in front of me. All the registers were open, but all of them were going very slow. Customer service on sales floor was excellent, as prices are very good. Store was clean. Parking lot was problamatic with security that seems oblivious to happenings in the parking lot.</review>

<review>I like this place. It's not that everything is great nor that everything is super cheap, but they have some things here that are really really good. And in many cases prices that are really hard to beat. Plus it's fast -- easy to get into -- easy to get out of.<//review><Name>Harry Littell< /Name>< pictures>

Lacking inventory and quality of fresh products most days along with enough cashiers and cleanliness of facilities and grounds. Taylor Center has not been maintained well in the past 2 years since this store has been put in. Transients loitering in front of store and panhandling.</text>

<Review>Worst "neighborhood" market in town. Bathrooms are either filled with junkies locked in a stall for hours or "closed" constantly. EVERY customer is treated like a criminal. Had security "notified" about me scanning green onions at self check out. Got yelled at for using the barcode, even though there was NO plu to enter. Highly disappointed in this walmart.< /Review>< resp>

Rudest employees. One register open while 5 other employees are standing around. One cashier actually yelled at me that she is closed AFTER I put ALL my groceries on the counter. Said her sign is out but it wasnt it had fallen, and she didnt apologize. Rude Rude Rude.</text>

Horrible place! Always out of stock, the worst customer service I have ever dealt with and when I worked for Walmart if we EVER treated customers the way this place does WE WERE FIRED ON THE SPOT!! I Won't ever shop there again! Also, I found SEVERAL packages of OBVIOUS ROTTEN MEAT in meat department right on top and more buried under good meat. HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING PLACE!!<//text>

The worst Walmart in Sacramento. Nothing on the shelves for Christ sakes they didn't have bell peppers zucchini they did not have garlic it was a hot mess I won't be returning. Don't waste your time if you want to complete your grocery list go somewhere else.<//review>

Tired of the pharmacists pushing vaccines on me. They lied and said their registry said I didn't have a tetanus shot when in fact, I got one in 2013. Those shots are good for 10 years. Second, I'm pregnant and told the pharmacist I was pregnant and he didn't seem to care that I didn't want a flu vaccine.
My choice, my body. Stop trying to kill more ppl, wal mart. You already overwork those poor ppl in the sweatshops!< /Text>

I go to the neighborhood store because of the prices.  But it seems everytime I go there  is something I want that the shelves are empty.  Last night it was regular Hormel chili and Tyson 4.4lb frozen chicken nuggets.
The nuggets are normally not in the freezer and I normally buy a brand I don't prefer. Last nite I was ticked and came home without nuggets (and only one can of turkey chili). They had lots of hotttt chili.<//review>

Was good. Way overcrowded, not well stocked all the time now ever since The El Camino and Watt store closed. If you're Disabled and need the eleslctric shopping cart, good luck. They only have one.</Text>

I stopped going here over a year ago.  Was driving by and needed a few things. Even worse than it was. Literally empty shelves at 9:00 on a Saturday morning. Now they have some items locked up just to make it even more ghetto<//Review>

I never come here cause we grocery shop at winco BUT I needed a box of gloves for my caregiving job . One item . I did self checkout and thanked the self checkout Walmart lady for her help , she saw me make my perchase. On my way out the guy stopped me of all people to check my receipt. I asked him “you really going to check my receipt for a box of gloves?” He said yeah . When I got my receipt back I left , and with an attitude he told me bye . Rude and unprofessional.<//Review>

<rating>3</rating><Review>I gave this store 3 stars because it doesn't carry as many of the items I was use to buying at the Watt Ave & El Camino Ave location before they closed it. They stopped carrying my favorite UV Brand Blue Raspberry Flavored Vodka at this location & they don't always have my favorite 98 cents bag of 3 White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut Cookies, my favorite red colored Hawaiian Punch Fruit Punch flavored drink, my favorite Gouda Cheddar mix Cheese or my Mike's Hard Lemonade Black Cherry. The staff is nicer & more knowledgeable & helpful here than the North Highlands location as well. I miss the El Camino Ave staff's friendliness cashiers, customer service, stock clerks & pharmacy staff. However the stock clerk Paul, all of the pharmacy staff & Dave/David and Wayne both awesome & knowledgeable older gentlemen cashiers are all the wonderful employees at this Fulton & Marconi Neighborhood Market location, but the managers are not as knowledgeable as those staff members I mentioned. I don't like the discusting cigarette smoke smell when I walk into the store, am waiting in line or walk out of the store.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x809ad97f430d01db:0xd0a7b7b4b8d17393< /gmapID></record>

<review>The service the last 2 hrs of operation are terrible, almost no carts available because the staff uses them for stocking the few employees there at night are pretty rude across the board and the cashiers can be very rude without any provocation. All in all if I didn't get off work so late I would never shop at this location.<//review>< Pictures>

HORRIBLE employees!!! Store aisles are a hazardous maze of abandoned carts (by both customers and employees), rolling 2-level ladders, stepladders, and other obstacles. Employees couldn't care less! I took pics of all the mess, which I will be sending to the corporate office along with a LONG letter of complaint. If I could give this store a negative rating, I would.< /text>

EDITED 06/24/20 , store is trying hard to keep  stocking regularly and they added more self checkouts, it's improving,  hopefully they'll maintain that.<//Review>< Pics>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>It’s just not Walmart Store 5230!!! It is missed in the neighborhood. Every time I’ve been to the Neighborhood Market, the selection wasn’t great, like they can’t keep the shelves stocked. But it’s Walmart product and price, and you know what to expect. It’s just a much smaller scale with some depts having minimal items. Will go back because I don’t want to drive all the way up Watt Ave!</Review>< response>

Disrespectful  Employees, Walmart should train Employees appropriately, and inform them that certain things can lead to a store being shut down. I called in to bring something to the stores attention. I was then treated as if i was lying. I don't care about the money. Now I will be going to the FDA. ILL ADD SOME PHOTOS OF COCKROACHES ON MY rotisserie chicken. Ill stick to Safeway or Railys. 🤢🤢🤢<//text>

HORRIBLE employees!!! Store aisles are a hazardous maze of abandoned carts (by both customers and employees), rolling 2-level ladders, stepladders, and other obstacles. Employees couldn't care less! I took pics of all the mess, which I will be sending to the corporate office along with a LONG letter of complaint. If I could give this store a negative rating, I would.<//Review>

I have top agree with a  lot of the reviews.  This store always has empty shelves. I usually don't shop here more than twice a month with my EBT. It never fails every time I've gone there in the last 3 months there's always they are lot of on my shopping list.  Very disappointed as I love the savings catcher of Wal-Mart and the other benefits of shopping at Wal-Mart. It's convenient for me so I'll be back.</Review>

I will spend the extra money to go to real grocery store next time! This Walmart Neighborhood Market is a joke! They act like the things they're selling there are Fort Knox Worthy... So many Security checks, too much hassle for not enough product! And their prices are not that much cheaper than the real grocery stores! ... Raley's, Bel Air, Safeway! I will be shopping at the aforementioned grocery stores in the future!<//review>

<Review>Small neighborhood store..needs more staff..more inventory.I like good customer service and these'are difficult times'right now but yesterday we'waited a long long time in aisle 1'while the cashier picked all the overripe strawberries from a customer's container. Then she ran to produce dept to get customer another container. We just want to get in and out quickly.< /Review>< user_name>

It's ok because that specific Walmart wasn't ALL THAT.... lol.

It's smaller than the other Walmarts I've been to and plus they have NO electronics and no home supplies there such as coffee makers and blenders.

Overall.... That Walmart kinda sucks<//text>

I live close by, but I rather go to Winco because they never re stock items on shelves, they never have baskets when I go, and they barely have bags, the carts are hard to push, they don't stock their produce plastics, and their produce section is always messy. The employees are not friendly and their rude. They always ignore me when I ask for a bag.</text>

Love it great alternative since losing the El Camino location.  However,  I
do like the Super Walmarts, but for just food and toiletries this location serves the purpose.<//Text>

<text>Walmart should be ashamed of this store. Yesterday I went there to get produce. They were out of vegetables. Many shelves were empty throughout the store. I asked if they were closing this site. The answer was “no we just don’t have enough inventory”. Hmmmm not good.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The selection is old merchandise and the prices are higher than Raleys. I recommend filling your prescriptions next door at CVS and doing your shopping up the street at Raleys.< /Review>

It is Wal Mart, yeaaa. But no, it is way too small. Always crowded, closes at 12- good and bad. Just groceries- limited items. Cust. Service desk is getting more and more congested.< /text>

Employees are rude and assume you are there to steal from them. At least that was my experience at the neighborhood Walmart on Marconi Ave in the self checkout.</text>

<text>Ive been living a stones throw away from this Walmart for all most 4 years now and after tonights experience i will go out of my way and go up the street to the other Walmart. I went in there and grabbed a couple things as usual. I tell the girl at the checkout that i needed some ciggerates. When she comes back there is another employee standing there waiting to relieve her. She asks for my ID. The other employee says out loud ' why are you IDing him? He's old'. I have never been so disrespected like that ever in a customer service environment. If that isnt the definition of discrimination then i dont know what is. Believe it or not that is the second time in the past 2 years an employee of this store has insulted my age. The first time wasnt that bad but still unprofessional. But this time it had my blood boiling. I was shaking. I went back in the store and spoke with the manager. I explained to her that basically if he had done that in a different setting he wouldn't be pleased with the results of his actions. If you are an employee of this store i want you to understand something. The laws that protect you from discrimination and harassment in the work place are the same laws that protect the consumer. What im saying is think before you speak to a customer. If your not sure what to say then dont say anything. Not a single one of us wants to be there in the first place and that includes you so the entire situation is already socially awkward and frustrating. I look forward to speaking with customer service about this because nobody should be treated like this especially when 40% of the times i open my wallet im doing it in a Walmart checkout line.</text>< Pictures>

Only giving 3 stars for this location. Employees hard at work, but store has suffered in recent months trying to keep food on shelves as they have absorbed the closure of Watt Ave Wal-Mart unfortunate demise.<//Review>

< Review>
I have paid my pg&e bill here multiple times with old bills bc all they need is my account  number on the paper. Today the girl tells me she will not let me pay it bc it's not my current  bill showing current  due date.  In the past its been made clear smude can not be late. Only pg&e whenI've goneto rancho or elcamino/watt locatons. I'm going to shop at the watt and elcamino one from now on.</Review>

This little Walmart is always busy, long lines and slow cashiers. Especially at the customer service counter. Have to repeatedly ask for more bags even after telling them I want everything bagged. I'm paying for them so I don't know why they are stingy with them. Only market in the area.<//text>
