good place to play badminton. I just had a really bad experience, feel very disappointed, should never fix your string at here. After a long time wait, I got my rocket back and I found the rocket itself bended. I have to go anther place to fix the rocket. there is no zero star otherwise I will give 0 stars to the personnel who fix the string of m< /Review>

<Review>Really great place to play badminton if you live anywhere east of Pomona. It is the closest one. The courts are well taken care of and the gym is nice and neat. Although the only draw back is the amount of people that show up. It is packed during the weekday after 6pm until 9pm.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7YYQUW7TMepN-715LZ5YnNfMFvqWpfou3APfW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4JrCXc6TkmkaCXlg6eUL4SjYBHfL70ic9MZoH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbGnjiXuNd2RySLQFMv3-w5d942GutyJ3I5INF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNrQ6fbPP8GVv7DLaShsc5mEQCg3FrboI1tRPS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcFzuUAuzmflFVMiuoAXLtKxvqqfdvDlB7xYEA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpwqAnx-vFVTb2yQNR6u40M2aKapWDC8H_519Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0YvN6WgSySZx40cFhKF9kVTXa3cHzuR1Rc_hi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWBLg2LFHSOkyTJFedtpT3xvWvEMA8AusWQFR-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c333b1ebaecb01:0x61a5b96610fbfa2c< /Gmap_id></record>

This is a pretty new badminton/ table tennis (ping pong) gym. It switched ownership once since it was opened. The gym is well maintained. It was very cleaned, especially the bathroom! The mats for badminton were in great condition that my friends did not complain about having pain on their knees after their games!

They have a sauna room that is shared by both male and female. It was on timer, so it will take a little while to warm the room up. There were simple gym equipments upstairs for people who wants to workout!

The only thing I want to complain is that this place is cold during winter! What I did was going to the sauna room to keep myself warm in between my badminton games!</review>

The only problem is that they don't open the air conditioner, so the air is always hot and stuffy. There are a few courts open for people who are going to be playing there without reserving a court, though they usually only leave three. They should fix that. Overall, though, it's a nice place to play.</Text><Name>shelly< /Name>< gmap_id>

I was told they are originally sgvbc and they move to his location. I will say this an upgrade comparing with their previous location. Although space between each court is close, and there isn't too many seat to place personal belongs and bottle water,  I personally think the lighting is better here and I dont feel that hot. Restroom is a definitely upgrade. There is shower room and even sauna room!<//review>

This badminton arena is super clean. Staff is friendly and it's sort of empty (which is a great thing for me, bad thing for the business). I really encourage people to come and play. The gym still needs a bit more work and hopefully they'll add more to the front of the ppace.< /Text>

< Review>
When I first walked into Arena Badminton some months ago it was a sparkling clean attractive new facility. It had air conditioning, a sauna, a separate gym and bright lights. There’s a water fountain for drinks and/or filling your water bottle with filtered water. It was actually exciting to see such a nice place for badminton lovers. Some players liked the new badminton courts but others complained the playing surface was too hard. But nonetheless it was a major improvement over the old dilapidated and  seriously neglected facilities nearby at SGVBC.
However as lately it seems the management and or owners have become overwhelmed by the upkeep of the place. The air conditioning isn’t working well and the entire building is very warm even before the hot spell. But at least there seems to be some cooling which was way better than SGVBC where one risked themselves and their children to heat stroke. Arena is not there yet but still it can be stifling and uncomfortable. The courts themselves seem to be well maintained but not other areas in the building. It seems the other parts of the building are suffering the same neglect as the building at SGVBC. The toilets in bathrooms are already having problems with getting back up and broken and it seems it takes quite a while to get them repaired. There haven’t been any paper towels on the dispenser for weeks. And the windows in the lobby haven’t been cleaned for a long time the same as the mirrors in the bathroom. There is no cafe like the wonderful Indonesian/Chinese place they had at SGVBC. They had the best nasi goreng I’ve ever tasted.  But unfortunately it appears the owners did not consider their plight at all when they closed shop there. Rumor has it that they were given extremely short notice, like maybe a week or two, before their livelihood was ripped from them. At any rate there seems to be enough room at Arena for a small cafe like this but of course that would take some investment and time. There is a vending machine in the lobby but that hasn’t worked for weeks now. And they also had frozen juice bars but the freezer is just sitting in the corner now also out of service for weeks.
The parking is ample here. They had beautiful shade baring trees throughout the lot but a few weeks ago the tree trimmers butchered them and they no longer produce the same shade and look stunted and sick. There are still talk trees on the perimeters however if you’re concerned about sap and dew dripping onto your car you might not want to park near them. Also beware that the road and the 60 freeway is right there and both are heavily travelled by trucks. It is extremely dusty. Your car will actually be covered in oily dust within ten minutes so consider parking at the side of the building rather than near the street.
This is such a new and beautiful place. I truly hope it can be kept up and not fall into the rot that became SGVBC, for the sake of all the players and all the children who are also training here.<//Review>

Amazing , All in one Club, I was there last week on  Dec 8, 2018 Saturday to play Table Tennis, It was amazing , International Standard Tables and court , i have not seen such a Nice Sports Club locally in Southern California. I was given a Tour by the Club Management, no wonder why this Club is one of a Kind in the country.

Pro: very spacious, high ceiling, convenient location, exercise area, wash / shower facilities, about 10 pingpong quality tables ( enough space for few more), membership fees are acceptable.

Conclusion: Not 100% operational. Will visit again mid February 2019. Very promising.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>Interior of this place is really neat and brand new as expected of a place that just opening up. I came after I saw there shop saying they moved. I accidentally interrupted their lunch, but they still strung my racket for me and was very kind to do so. I heard they are really good and professional status at restringing rackets which is why I came. I will be coming back even if it's a farther drive for me. I say in terms of stringing and service they beat san gabriel valley ii by a big margin.<//Text>< user>

Coach Dan is a goat'}< /Response><review>Perform for Life is really the best. The second you walk into this community, you’re greeted with open arms from everyone. All movement specialists have a uniqueness to them with their own niches, and are all extremely knowledgeable in their craft. These coaches will go above and beyond to get you where you want to be. I've worked with Coach Dan and he is one of the realest you’ll ever meet. He’s honest about what he sees that needs improvement and will work diligently with you to reach your goals and then some. He isn’t hesitant to tell it like it is. During this time, he’s making sure all his athletes are out there and putting in the work with socially distanced 1:1 sessions in the park! 10/10 would recommend.</review></record>

I had a virtual session with Coach Dan that was wonderful! I got a great workout that helped me feel strong and more aware of what my body is capable of. Coach Dan made it possible to do everything from home without the need to buy any equipment - making this the most accessible and enjoyable workout I have a had in the last few months! I highly recommend Coach Dan and Perform For Life!< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I trained with Anthony N. for 6 months and had the best experience at Perform For Life. Prior to starting, I had been recovering from a series of injuries to both my lower and upper half of my body, so I was a out of shape and had only finished my Physical Therapy a few months prior. After completing the assessment, I was paired up with Anthony N. who had also suffered from a shoulder injury before - and was well equipped with in his expertise on how to get my mobility and strength back. Anthony took his time with me, and was careful to not overwork certain problem areas until my body could handle it. This is not to say Anthony went easy on me when I did have the strength, but I appreciate Anthony's patience in allowing my body to grow at a safe pace. I highly recommend Perform For Life (regardless of the location) if you are somehow who is looking for an intimate training session with a knowledgeable fitness specialist, or looking for a small group training class that is not 30+ people piled into a room.

Lastly, the gym plays great music! I know music is subjective, but it's not just top 100s on repeat every single day. Some gyms in the city will just play the same station every single week, and it gets tiring to hear. Good music does wonders for a workout session.

Thanks for all the hard work Anthony! You've made me a stronger person because of it. Thank You P4L!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I had a virtual session with Coach Dan that was absolutely awesome - I was able to get a great workout! I have a fused ankle and the best part was feeling safe and comfortable doing exercises while knowing Coach Dan knows his stuff. I have already recommended Coach Dan and Perform For Life to others!</Review>

<text>Where do I start, this P4L gym is amazing! I've been to this location a few times and would rate my experience 5 stars each visit. Clean bathrooms, sanitized equipment, and new weights!

Awesome energy and knowledgable trainers ~ they are extremely eager to help and will take time to teach you fundamentals if you've never seen the exercise before.

They take time to listen and understand what you are striving for ~ WILL help you meet and exceed your goals, while having fun!

The classes are the right amount of intensity for everyone, and you'll love the workout supersets. I'll be back again, next time I choose the music! THANK YOU COACH DAN!< /text>< Pictures>

<username>Kristina Perlas</username><review>Small Group classes here are excellent!  The 7:10pm HIIT-Strength Monday and Thursday classes are great!   I’ve been taking the classes for almost a year now, started with Coach Becca and now Coach Jon.  He’s personable and keeps the motivation up after a long day!  You can make it as challenging as you need, with a max 8 people he’ll guide you to do the exercises correctly.  There are regulars to the class, and seeing the great fun people in my classes makes working out something to look forward to!   The other group classes are great too when I get a chance to do them, but I’m glad P4L has a 7:10pm class as that works best with my schedule!</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>It was my second time taking a group exercise class with Perform For Life, but my first time taking a Small Group Class at this location. I took the class with Coach Jon and it was definitely one of the sweatiest classes that I've been to. He went through all of the exercises clearly before we began each circuit. The exercises made my muscles burn-in a good way, and by the end of the class I was ready to just lie on the floor. Coach Jon is funny and engaging with the rest of the class and encourages each person to do their best. While I haven't taken many classes at P4L, it's clear that he wants us to know that everybody at P4L is a part of the family.</review>< pictures>

Been doing small group classes and I love it. Very challenging in a great way. The coaches pay a lot of attention and adjust the exercise for your skill level (both easier and harder). I love that there are different workouts with different coaches to change it up as well! Everyone has been so nice. It definitely has more of a community feel that I haven't seen at most gyms. Would highly recommend P4L!</text>

<review>I live between P4L gyms on Mission|Castro and FIDI. I like this one better because of coach Garrett. I change my schedule to make sure that I can attend his class. He is new coach but he goes extra mile to make sure that you perform exercise correctly. He also experiments with routine to find what will fit better for specific group. I definitely recommend P4L gyms to anyone who wants to stay fit and healthy.< /review>< rate>

By far the best small group class I have taken in SF! I am always traveling so it is hard to find a gym with classes that run all day. The location is a nice size and has a nostalgic feel to it. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a personal training studio that feels like home.<//review>

i LOVE this place! The owners are the best part because they created such an awesome environment to work out in..but it is more than just a gym it's a place to grow and learn what your body is capable of doing! My coach Charles is worth every penny and more! He has been gentle yet firm to push me to do the best i can! I highly recommend!

Almost 4 years later this is my second home. With my continuous struggle of scoliosis I decided to enhance my life with adding one on one trainings at P4L. I avidly did the shared personal training sessions which was and still is exhilarating, effective, and powerful. My choice to get one to one personal training was to hone in on getting a better quality of life and really getting the help to find exercises to enhance my performance. Cheri has been my personal trainer for almost a year now and I am extremely fascinated by her technique and ability to scientifically find exercises that have really enhanced my life. She is extremely educated, present, & filled with knowledge. Every session I feel stronger, challenged, and supported. She is tactful and really takes the time to curate the best movements and techniques to make me stronger. Best decision I have made to take care of myself more.<//Text>

I did group exercise classes for a few months here. The gym was too small for me. The size really limited the amount of different exercises one could do so you were doing pretty much the same workouts every week. The classes were also too crowded when they were full and often the classes you wanted would fill up before you could get a spot. The coaching was ok given their constraints though.<//Review>

<Review>The P4L staff go out of their way to make the complex, simple. Over a year ago I walked in with a complex goal of losing weight, getting stronger, being more flexible, and finding a regular routine I would commit to. That's a pretty complex ask. They simplified it, into a series of personal and group tasks. My coach, Austin, made our 1 on 1 sessions a place to mark incremental progress, tracking gradual increases in weights and reps to keep me motivated. Taking classes between sessions kept the momentum up while bringing a lot cardio into the strength building. And with so many different instructors with different styles--Melissa, Charles, Amber, Anthony--it stays fresh and different. In six months P4L has met and exceeded my expectations. I'm very thankful for such a engaged and dedicated staff</Review><date>1548630115539<//date>< name>

Walking in, this place has a great energy and you can tell that there is a personal relationship with the trainers and their clients. I worked with Pita and Maddie during the 2 hour labs that we did which included checking flexibility, stabilizer muscles, analyzing my gate and VO2 max amongst other things.  They use cutting edge technology and video to help provide you with visuals. They are easy to work with and we laughed the whole time. At the end of the session, I left feeling happy and uplifted even though these were people that I had just met.  Even if you are just starting to get into sports/exercise, this is a great test to get your baseline fitness and help identify goals moving forward.

The entire staff at P4L is so welcoming and awesome to work with! Small Group training is always challenging and fun!

I trained with Charles for three months to prep for my wedding and it was the best choice I could have made!  Charles has a great way of pushing me to do things that I would never do working out on my own, while also helping to understand the mechanics and the reason why I am doing the exercises.  Charles' laid back attitude and calming presence makes workouts fly by.   He consistently listened to the exercises I enjoyed and helped to tailor my workouts to the things I enjoyed.

Most importantly, I can see a huge difference in my strength and body composition since starting to work with Charles.  I had particular areas that I wanted to target for my wedding dress - Charles not only improved those areas but also improved my entire body.  He paid attention to my body composition and my strengths and weaknesses and worked to improve those.<//Text>

<Review>Coaches at P4L are really knowledgeable when it comes to treating your body right, conditioning, training etc...  I love the gym atmosphere, everyone is really supportive. I’ve taken boxing and strength/conditioning classes. Coach B instructs you through rigorous boxing workouts, I would recommend this class to anyone. Coach Charles instructed me through one of the hardest workouts after a long day at work. If you want to relieve some stress take one or both of these classes, they will not disappoint. Keep up the good work P4L Coaches!✌🏾<//Review><gmap_id>0x8085809ff89c7e1d:0x68a7acd3a3e45dc6< /gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

They are both extremely knowledgeable and push me to achieve things I thought I could not do; however, if I am having a low day due to fatigue or stress they meet me where I am and provide encouragement to help me achieve my goals. The entire group at P4L is awesome and very accommodating!<//review>

<time>1516731058321< /time><Review>Hands down, P4L is the best gym & personal training experience I've ever had. Not only are the classes fun and challenging, but they are small enough to where you still get individualized attention. The coaches truly do care about their clients and helping them meet their fitness goals. My trainer, Brandon, really pushed me to show up. In fact, I don't think he EVER missed 1 day in the 9 months we trained together! The owners, Bryan and Justine, have really set such a high industry standard that I've yet to see in any other gym. Not only are all of the coaches knowledgable and constantly learning about topics in their industry, but it's evident that they are passionate about their work. This isn't just "a job" that they show up to (sadly, like most gym trainers I've had). It's a lifestyle that they are excited and committed to, and they're passionate about getting other people to love fitness. My favorite thing about Perform for Life is the community that they've built - Bryant and Justine, along with all of the coaches and even the clients!, are all so kind and genuine. Look no further - THIS is IT!< /Review>< user>

<Text>As a former college baseball player and avid activity thrill seeker, P4L’s softball league was exactly what I needed. I felt a little apprehensive at first when I got the invite, due to the fact that I didn’t know anyone involved with P4L, but as soon as I was surrounded by the community built by P4L I was sold! It was such a great season! The people were amazing! No judgment! No trash talk! No bullies! A space to be comfortable in your own skin while enjoying the practice of life long healthy living ... Thank you, P4L!<//Text>< pics>

<review>I've been doing the group training classes for about a month now at P4L and I wish I had started earlier!  I already feel and look way more fit and I've noticed I'm more energetic and focused throughout the day.

I've had group training classes with Charles, Nathan, Amber, and Anthony so far.  They all are very welcoming and they bring their own individual personality and fitness background to their classes. The group sessions offer a HIIT interval training style with a combination of body weight exercises, free weights, and stretching.

If you're looking for a fun and rewarding way to jump-start your  physical activity level, I highly recommend trying this place out!

Best. Gym. Ever. I've been training at Perform for Life on and off for nearly three years. Recently, I've been working with trainer Michael Phillips, trying to improve my weight lifting numbers. Michael has done an amazing job of providing structure to my workouts and helping me see major gains in all of the big lifts (deadlift, squat, bench press). Everyone at the gym is incredibly knowledgeable in all things fitness, and they apply this knowledge in practical ways to help improve your form, prevent injuries, and see big gains. I'd recommend personal training at P4L without reservation for anyone who has hit a plateau in their fitness journey and need that extra push to take things to the next level.<//Review>

While P4L is not my primary gym, I still look to their faculties for my training and health approach. Appreciate you guys!< /Text>< rating>

My fiance and I have been doing the small group classes here for a few months and it is awesome! I used to do crossfit, but this is a much more sustainable approach to working out (and life). They focus a lot on the core, which is great for someone like me with lower back problems. Coach Charles is the man and coach Melissa will kick your butt! Enjoy!<//text>

< review>
Overall an excellent gym. Great coaches all around. I want to single out Coach Eva, she’s awesome. She started an Olympic lifting program from the ground up at this gym that is definitely the reason I keep coming. We have a cool mini-community with people on the same wavelength wanting to move more weight around and do more explosive movements than the small group classes allow with how many people are in them. It’s an awesome way to be able to track measured progress of performance in a way that’s more engaging for me than worrying about numbers on a scale. Only reason for the loss of the star is because it seems like management is getting a little dicey with the scheduling of the oly classes. Built out a new location that’s perfect for it with platforms and everything, put oly classes on the schedule then cut them a couple days later with no notice. Seems like it’s short circuiting a really cool aspect of this gym that was starting to grow. These classes are literally the reason I come and it’s rough to see them deprioritized like this.<//review>

Their workouts also target muscles I don't usually focus on when I'm by myself and improve on everyday movements.  They have a great team who are friendly, professional, and FUN FUN FUN!!!

It's been exactly one year since I started personal training sessions at Perform For Life and I'm so happy I found this place! I started out seeing Amber 2x a week and now see her only 1x a week. Amber goes above and beyond and makes sure I'm also exercising and maintaining a healthy lifestyle out of our sessions. She'll even go so far as creating workouts for me on days I am not at P4L. The P4L fam is the best. Thanks!<//text>

P4L is a family.  There is an amazing relationship between customers, owners, and staff.  I feel like my trainers listen and respect me.  I feel they listen and adjust the planned routine (in real time) to any pain I feel.  They also know when I am just whining or killing time.  My trainer even bought me wedding gifts (a miniature foam roller and lacrosse ball to take on my honeymoon).</Text>

I've been attending small group fitness classes for 5 months and I am the strongest I've ever been. All the coaches are motivating and genuinely kind people. The weekday morning classes are a great mix of body weight, dumbbell, kettle bell, and TRX training - with some HIIT thrown in.

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I absolutely love Perform For Life!! The best decision I made to further my boxing career was to step inside of this amazing gym.

The energy once you step inside is GREAT and very WELCOMING. The entire staff as a whole makes it a very comfortable and great place to be. I've been going to a cooperate gym since 2005 and I got use to seeing personal trainers usually just sitting there on their phones while watching the client work, looking very uninterested, not engaged and basically the trainer just looks like he/she is going through things out of a book. Not here at Perform for Life. The specialist here not only look the part but they are fully engaged with their individual client. That goes for the group classes as well. I usually go to Charles's Friday morning group session and it's best group fitness class I've ever taken. With it being a small group setting it makes itnintimate to where you would get lost in the shuffle within those super huge fitneas classes and would be doing an exercise completely wrong and might even hurt yourself in the process.

Outside of the fitness spectrum, I love the fact that Perform for Life GIVES BACK. They volunteer their time at Glide Memorial, I see that they give back to the youth and they are for the community. The shows a lot of integrity and who they are not just as a gym but as a people. A place like that will always have my business and support.</text>< pictures>

<review>Originally I came to P4L to get my body in shape to look my best for my wedding this Fall; but I think I'm getting a lot more than that...not only a smokin' bod, (can't believe I just said that) but also a network of incredible people that want nothing more for you than to succeed in the gym and also in life. Really cool people, really cool gym. TRY IT!!!</review>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I can full full-hardheartedly say that Perform for Life opened my eyes to a whole new world of not only exercise but an all encompassing work out. For years I became a creature of habit and continued to do exercises that were not producing results and in the end unfortunately creating injuries & discomfort to no end where I felt I was going to give up. Through training with Bryant & Justine not only have I become stronger, leaner, and got my groove back, I was given the confidence that I can do anything. My body has seen results that I never thought was possible because the founders have the capability & intuition to provide an all encompassing workout that will make you the best version of yourself. Their amount of knowledge is insane and their ability to be personable makes you feel like you have known them for ever. Every time I walk into P4L I am filled with such high energy and every time I walk out I feel like I achieved a new milestone.</Text>< Pictures>

I have been working out at P4L for about a year,
first with Anthony Pitsch and currently with Taylor Kennon,
both excellent trainers and pleasures to work with.
I feel better and have more energy,
and I like to think I look better too.
I'm 76 years old, and I would recommend P4L training
to anyone, but especially to those of us getting older.
It's a pleasure with a lot of rewards,
and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.< /text>

<text>During 2016 I had four gyms, Perform For Life is the best! PFL is a unique combination of talent and community that combines to make it the best experience in SF.

All of the trainers teaching all of the classes and doing private sessions have kinesiology degrees. You won't find this background at your other local gyms. The owners work hard to provide the best product wrapped in awesome customer service, love, and community. This is a great place to meet and foster friendships while achieving your personal best. I cannot recommend them enough. I've worked with almost all of the trainers and all are amazing. I think you'll be impressed.<//text>< Pictures>

Recently I told Amber how pleased I was with our work together.  Through my work with her over the months, I have begun to make the transition from a person who had to go to exercise to help improve the odds of keeping my cancer in check, to a person who is beginning to think of exercise as a part of my personality and a valued lifestyle choice.
Amber shows unusual skill in gauging the exercises to my ability.  It often seems as if she starts a set of exercises with a low-ball warm-up resistance.  In subsequent sets I get to request more weight.  That experience of wanting to do more, to work harder is, for me, a unique experience around exercise.   By low-balling resistance and working up, Amber models and teaches a kind of patience that I had never associated with exercise and allows me to experience a quite novel experience in myself of eagerness around exercise combined with patience about the results.  Despite my impatience with her cautious approach, I often wind up feeling manageable muscle soreness after workouts which makes me feel just a bit of the self-righteous and heroic warrior.

Amber shows unexpected inventiveness in hitting the same basic muscle groups in novel ways as well as a consistency of attention to proper form which is unaccustomed to me.  This keeps my workouts interesting and also works all possible associated peripheral muscles. It also contributes to the impression that she really thinks hard about how to make the workouts interesting and entertaining.  She is also so consistent about monitoring the basics of good body mechanics that I now anticipate the corrections she is about to make.  This makes it easier to integrate our training into my daily activity.  For example, I now experience brisk walking as an exercise in awareness in balancing the demands on my legs and calves with my buttocks and back chain.  When lifting, I remind myself to anchor my lats and pay attention to not over-stressing my shoulder joints.  Over the months, my posture has greatly improved, and friends tell me that I am looking much stronger.

Amber is unexpectedly organized in the way that she presents her exercises. She typically starts with warm-ups, presents the main core of our workouts in in sets of 2 or 3 exercises targeting opposing muscle groups, each set repeated three times before moving on to the next set.  She finishes with some playful cool-downs and balance exercises.  This gives me a way to think about the structure of a workout session which has been very helpful to me in beginning to explore working out at home.

Amber's personality and attitudes present a good fit with my personality needs, which has been very helpful in encouraging me to think of exercise as an enjoyable part of my lifestyle.  She is professional about maintaining some distance between her needs and mine, yet not so distant that I don't feel that I have come to know her as a person and feel a sense of her genuine caring and playfulness.  She has skillfully managed all the negative personality traits and unproductive attitudes that I brought to exercise.  For example, each workout she cheerfully and genuinely encourages me to complain about whatever is interfering with my desire to exercise - and then tells me to get going.  She models using one's body with all its limitations as best as one can at the time.  Again and again, I have had the experience of coming in grumpy and unmotivated and leaving feeling energized and successful.  An experienced exerciser may take this for granted, but believe me, this experience is unaccustomed in my life, especially as I have aged and since my cancer treatment.

To the extent possible, I think that Amber brings a quality of broad knowledge, professional attitudes, consistent effort, and playfulness  to our workouts that encourages me to think about my daily activities as potential opportunities to reinforce my workouts and to gladly integrate exercise more deeply into my life.  And that is what Perform for Life is all about.<//text>

<Text>I started my fitness journey here at P4L in 2014.They made working out fun for me. Their trainers were great and very knowledgeable, made me feel at ease and safe. I had to leave due to personal reasons but the health and fitness seed that P4L planted in me kept growing. Now I’m finally back, YAY!!!The atmosphere is still the same, warm and inviting. The trainers, there’s more!! Which means different workout routines because no trainer trains the same and I personally love that!! The fact that P4L was always in the back of my mind no matter where I was doing Fitness or falling off, lol, says a lot about P4L. They left a great impression on me and I’m so happy to be back!<//Text>< pics>

My gf initially dragged me here for personal training sessions and the whole experience from signup to actual sessions was well above my expectations. Bryant and Justine listened to my hesitations about "gym life" and reiterated that P4L fosters a extremely open and non-judgmental culture and is most importantly, fun.

Charles is our PT and is great. He listens to your fitness goals and constructs something that is realistic and challenging, but also enjoyable. So far it's been a great experience and couldn't recommend both P4L and Charles enough. Thanks guys!<//Text>< Pictures>

Perform for Life has changed my life with their dedication to overall health and wellness. I've been going for three years now and it's hands-down the best place for fitness in SF. I've tried everything from muay thai, to big-box gyms, barre, spinning...you name it - and Perform for Life has been the only place that I'm excited to go back to. In three years, I have not done one same workout, I'm constantly challenged and I'm part of a community/family there that I love!< /text>

<review>I currently reside in LA, but when I visit SF I always make an effort to work out at P4L w/ Coach Bryant. Bryant conducts full body assessments and suggests helpful modifications for my bilateral tendinitis in my arms. His specialized workouts cater to what my body needs, and I feel safe that I will not further injure myself. I have gained a lot of strength and mobility during our sessions and have continued to follow his regimen here in LA. I would also like to mention that Bryant referred me to Bob, who’s speciality is in Clinical Body Work. Bob helped me tremendously when I had an acute flare up of tendinitis in my achilles. After a session with Bob, I was no longer limping, and my pain decreased drastically. The next time I am in town, I will definitely be training with Coach Bryant! 💪🏻</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Having been to many different gyms, P4L has definitely been the best. Feeling comfortable and confident that your trainers really know what they're doing is so important. I have had injury problems for years and have often had issues with trainers at other gyms not giving me the correct exercises based on those injuries. But at P4L, I know that I can trust that they are giving me exercises tailored to me that will only help improve my health and not aggravate my injuries. The few corrective exercises that they've given me thus far have been very helpful for my chronic back pain! Furthermore, going to P4L is always an enjoyable experience because every person is outgoing and friendly. They all make a point to learn your name and ask you about your day. Being a part of P4L is like being a part of a community rather than just being a member of a gym. Perform for Life is 100% deserving of it's #1 rating and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to go to a gym with top notch service and quality!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I have been working out here for a year, i started for post baby body recovery (which i achieved quickly) with the help of trainer Amber... she understood how i was feeling and adjusted each time based on how wiped out of a mom i was each week! With her help i am in better shape than before my daughter! and now that i have surpassed my goals we have expanded into strengthening and i come 2 days a week now! And i hope to continue to grow with thier help! #lovethisgym #p4lforlife</Text>

<review>My experience with P4L has been exceptional & rewarding so far. I Found out about p4l threw my girlfriend , she  is friends with coach charels, & they went to Sf state together! He had reached out to her trying to get intouch with me cause he had known I compete in mixed martial arts. Finally  I got in contact with coach charels, & I came down one day did my assessment, automatically felt comfortable with everyone, & it was a  good environment to work in. I was able to meet coach Bryant , coach Justine and coach Brandon that same day as well! These guys down here are professionals at what they do!!! They obtain the knowledge to help you with your personal needs, being a professional athlete or even someone who just wants to get in shape. I've never felt more stronger, faster and sharper than I do right now! They really do care for there ppl down here! They assist you in the areas you want to focous on & also make sure your work ethic is up to par. They are there to not only help you, but push you to do better! You come down here it's like one big family everyone working real hard day in day out, everyone says hi to you and bye when they leave, this stuck out to me because I come from traditional martial art school, and this is what they teach respect all your coachs and training partners! This is hands down the best gym in the Bay Area! I been here for 2 fight camps and pulled 2 spectacular performances of my Career thus far, and will be part of the P4L family for a very long time! Coach  Charles Armstrong  and coach Brandon are some beasts foreal! The whole staff are!!! I highly recommend this gym for everyone!!!!<//review>< pictures>

<Text>I've come to this gym for the small group classes and I absolutely love them.  One class was led by a resident boxer so we worked on throwing different punches with a partner and boxing-oriented training exercises.  I go here to get a great all-around workout with these small classes.  The different instructors keep things interesting and fresh every time.  They keep a close eye on you ask well to make sure you're doing the exercise right so you don't injure yourself (something the instructors at my climbing gym could learn from since I guess I'm the only one who's not a ripped adonis there).  The atmosphere is SUPER friendly, helpful, and welcoming to all skill and fitness levels.  They have all the equipment and very nice ammenities like a  couple of changing rooms in the back and a full on showah for those of you who get extra Sweaty McSweats before a day at the office. Charles is a pretty dope trainer, too!</Text>< date>

Every single small group fitness classes is taught by expert trainers who are also available for 1:1 sessions. Once you've hurt yourself at Crossfit or your wallet at Equinox you should come and meet the gorgeous and talented team and local community patrons at PFL. You won't regret it.< /review>< Rating>

< Review>
Took my mom to golden valley in Ceres. Waited about an hour before being seen but i understand that there was only one doctor working. However, when we seen the dr, he was great. Such good service & friendly. Good doctors are hard to find and he was one of them. We would definitely go back.< /Review>

<Review>I went in for a full examine but also told them I had an issue with my knee.  They did look at my knee but didn't even both with the full physical examine just checked blood pressure and temp and heart, the normal things a doctor would do. Not saying their practices are bad but I sat there for a good 2 hours to be seen for less than 10 min to get my knee looked at for 2minutes. I'm sure they are good but I did come in for more than just my knee which I had stated.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Great place! The provider was super & staff was just as great. I was told to be there 15 minutes early but office did not open till 8am. The only improvement I suggest is that opening time & appointment center should be coordinated. And office staff should be ready to go at opening time. Social distancing was in place. Office had a good plan for keeping pens & such other items wipes down. Hand sanitizer being used. Masks being worn. All precautions were being used. I will ask to be sent back to this provider in the future.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

DOCTOR KAUR PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE STAFF DOES.
People there don't know what they're doing. They have changed my appointment time 3 times with no notification then upon arrival they argue with me that I made the mistake when I have the printed appointment sheet. As if that wasn't bad enough now they have told me I went to the wrong clinic for my appointment after it was a hard task for me to get there. I was told that my appointment was somewhere else which is a big mistake on their part because again, I have the printed appointment sheet with doctor's name, time, date and address! I was told that the doctor was not at the clinic this day, well that's not my problem, I should have been called with a notification and an apology about it. Apparently once more my appointment was moved with no call to me. This place needs to hire competent personnel and stop inconviniencing  patients!<//text>

If you're an addict looking for a nice shop? it takes only 10 minutes for the Doctor to prescribe you a Drug. Your background doesn't matter,  don't worry.  That's all they do "for your health". They won't fix you.<//text>

Horrible place. Daughter never seen her primary doctor because he is always hours late or never showed up. Daniel diep. Wait hours to be see and damn near the same time in the room. There is one female doctor there that is the only one that's worth seeing. She's kind and takes her time with you. Not like the others. See u for 5mins and pushes you out of the room< /Text>

This is Jeri, I called looking for My old professor Dennis Anderson. He is a wonderful teacher. The skills and confidence that I gained from his classes have always helped me in all ways. I am hoping he will get my message and call.⁸</text>

This was my first time attending a concert at this location it was like an old fashioned theater it has been upgraded but still seems to need some work in the seats other than that the concert that I went to see was a tribute band to ACDC called La bonfire they were awesome we had a great time the beers were really reasonable prices and as soon as you walk in you smell the popcorn cooking it was amazing to smell that cuz I like popcorn from the movie theater I'm definitely going back they are going to have more concerts in the month to come and the people that work there are very friendly there are a lot of older folks who attended the concert but it doesn't matter because it's made it a cool environment didn't have to worry about all the younger crazy crowds u get at other venues.</text>

The Theatre is a work in progress but the acoustics were great and we are really looking forward to some new seats.

<Text>It was a fun concert BUT the seat are past terrible. One lady almost hit the floor it fell back so far anther one did n they came and taped it off. They served alcohol and several people were getting drunk. I will most likely not return there. It got bad. I felt sorry for the people who were near the intoxicated one. I saw one man laugh and he had beer in his mouth and 3 of the people in front of him got sprayed. Other were obnoxious. If they stop serving  booz, which they don't need to do if good programs, and fix the seating. One day I would go back n tell other a good place to go. But as it is I would not recommend it to the local drunk. Just Saying ! ! !. 👌👍✌😁😎<//Text>< pictures>

<GmapID>0x80db6f4585e343e5:0x7a4ab656afbe6407<//GmapID><Rating>4<//Rating><Text>I'm giving this four stars, honestly, out of nostalgia. And hope.  This was, at one point, a lovely theater. That time has long since passed.  There's been a few changing of hands in the last couple decades and it's now owned by what I believe is a non-profit preservation society.  Which is for the best. This isn't an IMAX theater.  It's an ooold theater. But old in the best way, with velvet curtains around the screen, crazy comfortable seats and bathrooms so old the lettering is in an art deco font.

I've seen some great movies here: Pulp Fiction, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Dark Knight, and the greatest movie ever made: Raiders of the Lost Ark.  (It even had a teaser trailer for REVENGE of the Jedi!) The side building even used to be my favorite comic book shop!  So yeah, nostalgia plays a big part here.  But it is lovely. And I honestly believe that some day it'll be the five stars I want it to be.<//Text>< UserId.>

It's a lovely old theatre with wonderful people working there, who provide a variety of venues.  They have the typical popcorn, candy and sodas. As well as a bar set up in the lobby.  It's a great place!</Text>

<Review>The man there is a sweetheart. He didn't have the popcorn machine on when I came in wanting popcorn so he said next time I come in he will give me some and not charge me for it. He is very kind. I love the big theater with the big comfortable old seats.<//Review>< response>

This is a fabulous venue for any kind of music that you may want to hear. It is a historic theater it's been part of our landscape for many many years. Try it out if you're ever interested in seeing a great concert</Review>

Theater needs love and care.  Sad to see it in such bad shape. I was there for a school awards ceremony and play. The microphones didn't work and it was hard, even impossible at times to hear the kids. I hope next year they either fix problems or find a new venue.  The one bright spot was the pop corn and the man who was so nice to my 2yr. old.</text>

The theatre has great acoustics, and dance floor to rock the night away to all your faves from Led Zep Again to The Bee Gee's.  I love it!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I had found a cup that goes to the bullet mini blender on a shelf there with no price tag so I asked a employee and was directed to a tall white gentleman that was able to give me a price of 50 cents. He was helpful and friendly. During check out I had a few items that did not have price tags on them and was told they could not sell them that way. when I ask for the employee that helped me get pricing earlier they said they had no idea who he was and that nobody worked there with that description. She proceeded to take my 50 cent cup and keep it saying it went with a juicer and I cant have it because nothing in the store cost 50 cents. there was no juicer she wanted the cup for herself. she let me have all the other things with not price tags. The woman said she was the manager.she was white, over weight and had various tattoos and was very rude to me. I hope she losses her job for this. I cant believe anyone would put here job at risk for a 50 cent cup!<//Review><user>117800076427176450780<//user>< gmap_id>

Went there because a friend told me they had a Hermes hand bag.  Knock off they wanted 399.00 for a knock off... What is their problem, who ever gets to price there stuff needs to do more research. Although rescue mission stands true to the hungry homeless and addicted people of Ventura county. they put all that money right in there programs. God bless their souls<//Text>

<Text>There's a good amount of stock available here for most things. But remember the super thrift store has a bigger range of products, mission only has bigger range of furniture products.

This is the first thrift store in Oxnard that I found out of many that had TV's and a large variety of furniture for sale.

Definitely worth a visit.

Getting Here might be a bit tough because the only entrance is from within a residential area.< /Text>< pictures>

An excellent thrift store! The place is kept spotlessly clean and impeccably organized.  The inventory ranges in quality from low-end to the best of the best and the prices are consistently fair and occasionally unbelievaby good. I highly recommend checking this place out.<//Review>

<text>4 stars for service.  Thanks for getting me and 4 others in quickly.... however I feel like the quality of the manicure was lacking.  I could have done this at home. Staff was nice though.<//text>< pics>

I have gone a few times. They have made updates for covid. The work is pretty good.  They listen, they don't give attitude. They allow for different type of payments.  Only thing is that the nails easily comes off so i have to tell them to use more glue. But really nice ppl.</text>

They did a really good job. Me and my sisters called after hours and they were willing to wait for us. When we got there they did an amazing job, they didnt rush it even though they were past closing time. Highly recommend them< /review>

<rate>3< /rate><review>This nail place is right up the street from my house so whenever I can't get in somewhere else it's basically like my last resort the work that they do is decent sometimes they do Rush but I think it just depends on who you get with now there is one or two people that do nails really good that have been there for a long time but I can't remember their name but I do know what they look like and you usually have to make an appointment with them the other thing that I don't like which I'm sure goes on and every nail shop or majority of nail shops is there always talking about people and of course you know they're talking about folks because they speak in their language and the way that they're looking at the end of visual I feel like you don't have to speak that language to know when someone is talking about you but other than that it's cool I guess</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x809ac6beb5c9ef5d:0x6c8006a7f36d663f</Gmap_id></record>

Nails look like my 12 year old daughter did them. Lady cut my finger while tryna get the glue from underneath my nails. Only reason I gave them 2 stars is because there was no waiting. Got my toes done at the same time and they cut the nails uneven. Will never go back there. Plus they dont even talk to you except about the prices.<//Text>

I just recently returned since the the AMAZING WOMAN who has been doing my nails for the past 10+ yrs. is working there now. I used to go there before to Peter, until I found Kim who was across the street at Venus Nails. So far the new owners have made everything seem pretty good! They're all very nice! The shop is very clean. The reason I gave it a 3 is have't been going< /review>< Rate>

Sacto Nails is my favorite place to get my pedicures. The staff is friendly and good at what they do. They just updated the salon with new chairs, stations, and decor. It's gorgeous!<//text>

Highly NOT recommend this place to anyone.

First day 2 my pinky nail chipped, then less then 2 weeks; in a week and half my middle finger nail broke/ came off.
Went to fix it, the lady was very rude and she was keep talking in her own language. Felt very uncomfortable. While she was fixing my nail she told me  I need filling done on all my nails, so I agree. Charged me $30. Little pricey but I was rush so had no choice. And while she was doing my nails I try to tell her you are hurt me but it seems like she did not care. Felt she was ignoring me and was counting talking in her own language to other employees.  Very bad customer service.
Will NEVER go back again.

<Time>1598752631485</Time><rating>5< /rating><review>Update... today was the first time I’ve been since they had to move their operations outside. I was a bit apprehensive that it wouldn’t be the same relaxing experience, but it was amazing! Obviously, they can’t move all those big massage chairs outside, but I was sat in a very comfortable chair that had been sanitized. They have portable foot baths so I still enjoyed all of the warm and bubbly foot spa experience. It was the first time I saw Py for my pedi and he was very thorough with cuticles and smoothing rough spots as well as giving the most amazing scrub/lotion/hot rock massage. There was a gentle breeze out and I enjoyed being outdoors! I saw lots of sanitizing and social distancing and safety precautions. I have to rephrase my previous comment to state the ladies and gentlemen here are the best!

Original:  Great salon! Very relaxing atmosphere. The ladies are always friendly and professional. My mani/pedi never feels rushed and comes out looking beautiful!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I've been there 3 times, each time a disappointment. They've hurt me, the nail polish is bumpy (expired), they are dirty, I can keep going... run for the hills!!!</review>

< review>
I should have left when I felt the unpleasant vibe with the afternoon visit to supercuts. I waited an hour before my turn and was given a 15-minute haircut. However, everybody before me got at least a 30-minute hair cut. Eventually, I realized my sideburns were uneven and untapered, and the back neck area was off too. Call that same evening to discuss my dissatisfaction. I was invited to return and fix the problem. They did a better job the second time. I do plan on returning either way.</review>

Multiple reasons why I disliked my times here but coming down to two reasons

I came on a Saturday a few months back and it's around 1130 noon and multiple families were waiting outside, we waited a hour until 12:30 and the doors weren't open. No employees were even on site! Why have "Store hours" if you're not going to abide by them?!?

The second is I went to this store at 7 pm. And a few customers were ahead of me, which is fine obviously. The stylist took my name down and I waited 30 minutes.  Once all the customers were done and it's 7:30 the stylist rudely told me that there "will be no more cutting for today as its getting late"
So I waited 30 minutes.  Gave got my name for a place to get my hair cut just for you to tell me you can't service a customer...

Better service is definitely appreciated.< /Text>

Very bad hair cut. The worst that I need to wait for hair to grow up as is too short can't be fix right away.  Not going there again.</text>

(Translated by Google) Pesimo service, call yesterday to make an appointment for a hair brushing, the young lady who attended me very kindly told me to call an hour before arriving .... now that I call I'm told that they can not that informality .... and for trusting me I could not find another room ... hurts and I thought and cut me and paint my hair there ... his attention leaves much to be desired ...

Refused to give a quote for mounting a tire. That’s about as straight fwd a quote one can ask for. So that’s pretty sketch. Expects you to come in, obviously once there he knows you wont go elsewhere and will pay whatever he comes up with based on no other metric.</Text>

Went to other tire repair shops like pep boys and Just tires. Either they were closed or said a patch job couldn't be done. Rey's said because of where the nail was a patch job was needed. Can't trust large businesses.</review>

Terrible service, bad business practice they took my tire to the back in a sneaky manor didn’t show me the thread and I ended up not purchasing ... I felt very uneasy about how they went about selling me a product I didn’t see ... to make matters worse then owners son was in a bad mood I asked for air in my tire he said yes then proceeded to take a break no explanation by the time they brought out the tire I was done sneaky business practice over priced and the owners son got in an altercation with me after I called out all the bad habits I noticed ... I went to Harbour tire on Vermont Down The street and was treated with respect and service. I also mentioned I had just come from Rey’s expressed my concerns and the worker at Harbor Tire mentioned so many of Rey’s guest come to them for better prices and mention how bad the place actually is. Do yourself a favor skip this place and go to Harbour on Vermont behind the gas station ! They will take care of you.< /review>

Not only that have many used tires in their stock but they are very professional and quick to replace them. It only took them 15 min to got through entire replacement process.

Beware.   I went in asking how much to patch a tire. I was told $15.  I told them ok I need  2 fixed. When completed I go to pay and he asks for cash and raised the price to $35. He eventually took my card. Seems kinda crooked they only want cash when they have a card terminal on the counter< /text>

Had a nail in my back tire and Rey fixed it himself for a really good price. He noticed that tread on my front right tire was very low and dangerous. Replaced my tire with an excellent used tire for a great price, fast & friendly.  Will definitely come back. Note that if you come on a Sunday, however it is cash only.<//review>

They ordered me the best tires that I requested in one day and it cost me hundreds less than most tire stores and shops. I will buy all of my tires from Rey's and tell everyone about their fast, friendly, affordable, and professional service.
Thank you Rey's Tires!< /text>< pics>

Tried to charge me $49 to change 2 tires. That's $24.50 a tire. His reason for this was because of the disposal fee, I told him I would take the old tires. He told me I couldn't, which is BS, I'm not require to leave the old tires there. Don't recommend this place. No wonder it was empty. No customers....< /text>

Been using Rey's Tires for approx. 6-7 years now... I've always been treated #1 while there. Always fair prices always excellent customer service... from the guys doing the actual work to his daughter that sometimes runs the office part of his family owned business. I give his card to everyone I know that needs new or the occasional used tires...</text>

Went here to get my tire checked and got looked at like they had no time for me. I'm a black woman. A white woman came in while I was leaving a man rushed to her attention. Maybe my skin color didn't click. Won't be going back to rey!!!! 😒😶< /Review>

Got a used tire for 35 dollars with tire installed. For my 2010  s10 pickup. Still solid.  They also only take cash or you can go to the liquor store next door and use the ATM.</Review>

Very expensive, and one of the fuel doors that fuel trucks use to put fuel into the pumps is so high off the ground that I've damaged my car going over it. Never coming back here!</review>

<Review>Car was on empty. Paid for a full tank of gas AND a car wash and the guy working at the station was totally rude. Bitched at me for washing off my windows before I went through the wash. I'm a paying customer! Have a little respect! Plus the reason I washed off my windows before going through the wash is because I needed them totally clean, which is something the car wash machine does not provide. Not worth the money.< /Review>< Pictures>

Had a long hard day at work and decided to head to this gas station because it is in a quieter neighborhood than mine.  Gas pump had a note to pay inside.  When I went in I asked the Hispanic man at the cash register if I could get gas on pump #4.  He just stared at me like an idiot.  I asked 3 times after finally which he finally spoke and rudely/sarcastically said: "What do you do when you pay for gas?"  Obviously I understood he wanted me to say how much I wanted on pump 4, but after my hectic day I wasn't thinking straight, plus I didn't think asking: "can I get gas on pump 4" to be such a strange request.  Last thing I needed in my day was a rude and unprofessional response from someone I was trying to do business with.  Based on others reviews I can see this man has issues because it seems like he treats others with disrespect as well.  Won't ever come back here.<//text>

<review>The cashier and the manager( I believe ) here are useless. The cashier does not know how to return my stuffs. And the manager( the shortest one in this location) always has a childish attitude, she never says hello to clients and always make clients uncomfortable. They forced me to get the gift card instead of money back to my bank account. Even though I did not agreed, they still did it :) I don’t feel good in here anymore. Bye bye. I shopped at around 2pm 07/02/2019</review></record></dataset><record>

I went to the store to buy there Halloween Sport Bra and hipster but they said they already ran out everything is sold out but saw their employees paying for it so that means they reserve it for the employees instead of their customers?? This is not right all the employees should be fired because first of all they shouldn't be saving that for themselves because other people wants to buy also!! I use to love VS but now is very disappointed! I should give them no stars because they don't deserve even one!!</Text>

I was very disappointed with the staff here today it was really insulting this was my first time shopping here nobody helped me I was in changing room trying on the bras because my size was not perfect the girl over there told me she'll be back with new one and I was  standing on bra in front of the mirror I waited like 10 minutes and nobody came I put on my dress and went to the same girl she told me she will send someone else and asked me to wait I spent another 10 minutes standing there like a fool then I went to another girl and asked about other bra so that they can help me she did the same thing she sent me in and told me to wait and she'll get another one and then again abandoned me there for like 15 minutes I was waiting for her wheny I came  out she told me that her manager asked her not to leave that room
Was like  am I looking you like a fool to stand in there and wait for a bra to come I just got off from that place and never going back very poor customer service<//review>

I normally shop at other Pink stores and have no problem but this store was making up their own rules because I never had an issues in other stores. Cashier was rude and didn't smile when helping me but the customer behind me was greeted with a smile and greeting.<//review>

This particular secret, is extremely unorganized but  it's also hard to get someone who works threre to help.  The only thing they do is ring you up. And be snobby about doing it too. There has to still be stores out there that give a shot about the customer.</Review>

I went to this store to return a swimwear top today. When I purchased it last week, it did not have a tag. I told them I want to try it at home and if not a good fit to return it and they told me absolutely it's ok to return without a tag. Today In this store they first refused the return. Then they try to refund it underprice! I asked for manager and she said their online system is down. I asked her to call customer service or online catalog and she refused. I asked for her name and she refused. Then she told me to leave and called the security!!!!! Wtf?

I love VS but they should train their personnel better. The security guy told me the girl name is amber (African American, very thin and around 20 years old with black long hairs) and the store main manger name is Nousin (was not there today). I'm very angry and disappointed. They ruined my day.

The security guy name was Daniel jack and his boss Rick Gutierrez. There were few other costumer present there and I did not think at the time to get their name as my witnesses for this malpractice by VS employees.<//review>

<text>Joseph Y. customer service was fantastic and he was very helpful and knowledgeable of the product. I gave it 4 stars because the blue lights are really bright and maybe should have been turned down to the floor. The products is made really well, but one of the headrest was slightly larger on one side than the other side, which is noticeable, other than that I would have rated 5 stars. But, I would recommend this product to friends and I would definitely recommend Joseph Y. for his great customer service.</text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Joseph has been extraordinary to work with. He helped design what I needed in my Theater Room and it looks amazing! He’s very easy to work with as well as contact. I would give more than 5 stars if I could.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dd2abf22c6692b:0x3701429ce3591218</gmap_id>< username>

<Review>We ordered 3 theater seats in black leather/white stitching. We had trouble ordering online so called to make the order. Service could not have been better. I spoke with Zach and he made the process pleasant as well as easy as he completed the order. Our seats were delivered in 7 days!! The delivery took 45minuted or less from time they arrived, set up and explained the functions on the seats and made sure everything was working properly. Good customer service is hard to come but we got it for sure with this company.  Enjoying our seats almost every night!<//Review>< pics>

My sofa came in a week later like I was told. Unfortunately a forklift went threw the box and damaged the arm. Customer service seemed awesome at first and the replacement arm/ not whole chair was submitted. 3 weeks later, never heard from anyone so we called. Angela Smith told me Replace arm won’t ship until Oct. That’s 5 MONTHS after we received it. They said they don’t have replacement arms in stock. REALLY??? Then send me the whole chair and take this one back. After I responded back to her with my frustration, never heard back from her.
I’m sorry but after spending 4k on a sofa sight unseen I’m very disappointed and frustrated!! After this company gets your money, they don’t care about you!! Sofa is awesome but customer service for damage done prior to delivery is horrible!</Review>

<Text>Amazing customer service from start to finish. Based on the details I gave Zach back in October about the gaming/movie room I was trying to create, he helped me choose the perfect chairs to fit my needs. Chairs arrived in plenty of time for the Christmas room reveal and they were so simple to put together, just click in the seat back to the chair base. Very comfortable and I highly recommend. We've been using these chairs for 2 months now and I have zero complaints. Money well spent!!< /Text>< Pictures>

I started speaking with Alex months before deciding to purchase from 4seating. I did a lot of research before buying and by comparison the other companies just kept coming up short. Alex took his time explaining every quality detail of the Helos chairs we purchased. He was patient and extremely knowledgeable about all the products and answered every question I may have had. I highly recommend Alex to any person thinking of buying from 4seating. In addition, absolutely do the White Glove delivery. The team was courteous, professional and very neat— totally cleaning up.  Happy Buyer Bob</Text>

I must say. I like to see and feel a product before I purchase. But after seeing the reviews I've decided to take a chance. Boy oh boy I didn't miss. Great product. Firm, well stitched and great overall. I ordered 3 days before the storm here in NY 1/29/21 so of course it was a delay. The delivery took about 17 days. Well worth it tho. I will say if you are able or have help skip the white glove service you can do-it-yourself very simple to put together. Some seating models do not attach together but with a $5 draw grip liner from home depot that immediately stopped all movement of the seating.< /Review>

On September 16th, 2020, I ordered SoundRight Surround Curtains, and a SoundRight Two-Toned Diamond (a wall accent).  At the time I placed the order, the estimated shipping time was 6-8 weeks.  A long time, I thought, but OK.  In November, when nothing arrived, I called and was told that it would take them an additional 8 weeks!  I figured with the pandemic, maybe that was to be expected.  Still, 4 months to ship from the time of my order seemed like a lot.

I don’t recall the exact delivery date, but I would guess it was around late January (within the revised delivery period).  The curtains came and were perfect!  Exactly as they looked on the website and as I ordered.  However, the diamond wall accent came in the wrong color.  I called them to report the problem.  They asked for photos, which I provided (along with the color swatches that I’d sent for prior to my order).  They acknowledged the error and promised to send me a replacement in the correct color.

That part was all great customer service.  The part that went off the rails was the expected delivery date was JUNE!!!  I got the confirmation of the correction order on February 2, 2021 and it arrived in June!

Better customer service would have prioritized the correction a customer had already waited 16 weeks for, especially for this little thing, which couldn’t take very long to make.

THE BEST PART: The replacement I received in June, was the same wrong color they originally sent!

When I called to complain, they again acknowledged the screw up.  They now promise that this time, they’ll get the replacement sent correctly.  However, having waited roughly 8 months at this point, I asked for my money back.  That request was completely ignored.  If their track record holds, I suppose I'll see the replacement sometime in October (11 months after I originally ordered).

The right thing to do would be to refund my money and send the correct replacement anyway.  Especially since the thing is made out of corrugated plastic, some foam, fabric, staples and glue.  It couldn’t cost much to produce.

Bottom line: I would not purchase anything from these guys in the future.  Mistakes happen.  It’s how you handle them, or don’t that separates you from everyone else. At this point, I feel I got lucky with the curtains.</Text>

I have been online looking for theater seating for months and came to this website and thought I'm going to call to order instead of doing it online.  I am so glad I did.  Zach took care of us and explained in detail the warranty, white glove service, the different types of leather and the delivery process.  We received the 4 seatcraft serenity back row chairs and they are so comfortable and very high quality.I would recommend with this specific seat, to order a couple head rest cushions for when you recline.
The customer service Zach provided was amazing. So much, I am calling him to order more for the front row. . I will be recommending this company to friends that are looking.
Thank you Zach and 4seating< /review>

Ordered these chairs on line mid-January.  They arrived this past Monday and they are GREAT! The accent lighting and power recline are perfect for our newly created home theater.  Great price, great service (white glove delivery was top notch), and Bob, the sales agent that helped me through the sale was OUTSTANDING!  I was concerned about the chairs fitting through the doorways in our home and Bob talked me through the entire process!!!  Thanks, Bob! and Thanks 4-Seating!<//Review>

< Review>
Waiting for our seats but those are going to be amazing, this review is about my experience with 4seating and specifically Zach Falcon (epic name bro!) with 4seating. He was EXCELLENT. I've done customer service for years at my job and Zach was outstanding! Excellent at helping answer all of my wife's and my questions and didn't put ANY pressure to make the sale happen, just politely guided us to our perfect sofa and answered all questions along the way! Great guy and DEFINITELY a good person to work with for your purchase!</Review>

<Review>Just ordered a custom Kodiak recliner in Midnight Blue leather and while I don't have the chair yet (I will update when it arrives)... if the chair is half as good as Zack Falcon's (awesome real name) customer service then I will be more than happy. I spoke with Zack over a month ago and asked for multiple specs on chairs because I have a certain size I need to stay within in my area. Zack sent all of them with no pressure and each with their own quote. Amazing customer service. So, I finally had the time to set down with the wife and figure out which chair would fit our area best and it came down to two. I was going back and forth and asked Zack to help me make a decision and based on his feedback and great detail I placed the order. I feel really good ordering something over the phone that I've never sat in because Zack walked me through it. Thanks Zack for the great customer service!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
I spoke with Zack Falcon when ordering this Vienna Sofa from Seatcraft.  He was very helpful and answered all my questions and concerns.  I was hesitate to order a couch online as I am short and worried if my head and neck would be comfortable with the headrest.  Zach assured me that my height would be fine with this couch. Today we received the couch, and all my worries disappeared.  The couch is beautiful; better than pictures online.  The brown color is perfect in our living room.  Assembly was easy, quality is terrific, and everything works great.  Couch is very comfortable!  Thanks Zack for your help!  We love the Vienna Sofa and would not hesitate ordering from Seatcraft again.<//Review>

I recommend Mr Joseph to any one that is looking for a professional movie room setup. He streamlined the process and followed the product all the way till delivery. Again thank you Joseph

We have been looking at chairs for quite a while now, and trying to decide which one was most appropriate for our needs. We decided to call during the Memorial Day sale to see if we could get some more information. Zach was our representative and he was very pleasant and patient with us as we walked him through our concerns. We finally narrowed things down to three items, and he was very good at pointing out the pluses and minuses of each so that we could make an informed decision. Ultimately we chose one, with the only drawback that the item was not in stock; so we had to wait 3 weeks for it to be in and then it would have to ship out to us. Unfortunately at this time we do not have photos of our installation - that will have to wait for a second post. We’re still waiting on a call from the Shipping Agent to make arrangements and we will also make a post/comment at that time as I consider that a separate portion of the total order.<//review>

<review>We ordered a row of 3 Diamante seats, and two individual recliners. The ordering process, delivery and setup were excellent and the chairs are highly functional. Clara was very helpful to work with and help pick the right seats. The seats look fantastic, are solidly built, and the motor mechanism seem to be reliable. My only issue - we set up our family room as our entertainment room so these chairs get used daily. The cushioning isn't as thick/luxurious as you might expect for a conventional recliner for your family room. They are kind of skimpy on cushioning. I notice this because I'm getting old & grumpy and my lower back sometimes feels it.  If I could knock a half star for this I would but its not worth knocking a whole star. They look and work great for our home theater setup.Oh and don't let your phone fall through the sides of the cushions. The powerful recline mechanism will totally crush your phone! Well, now I have a new phone.<//review>< pictures>

Our sales rep was Bob Wheelan, and Bob did an incredible job before the sale of explaining all the options and different chairs and sofas. Bob answered every question and knew everything about the different kinds of seating they offer.  Not only was Bob great before the sale, but there was a snow storm that caused our seating to take 17 days to get to us.  During that time Bob contacted the shipping company several times and helped get the shipment moving again after it had been sitting in Philly for almost a week.

For our theaters front row we went with a row of 3 Mantra sofa, that has 3 recliners, then added 2 removable  slide arm armrest so we could have a sofa when we wanted and separate seating for movie nights. For our back row we went with a row of 2 Mantra seats.

The Mantra seats are very well built with finished backs and full leather all around.  The seats have powered headrest, powered lumbar, and power recline, and also have base lighting, lighted cupholders, and sound shakers.  The quality and attention to detail in the seats is just great. The seats are incredibly comfortable and I'd say the seats are a medium firmness  and have completely change movie nights.

The seats came in 5 boxes on 2 pallets and the boxes are huge and the seats are heavy so get a buddy to help.  Seriously each seat weighed about 140lbs and the double arm recliner that makes up half of our row of 2 weighed even more.

I can't say enough about my experience before, during or after buying the seats except ask for Bob.  He'll take care of you and you won't regret your purchase.<//Review>< Pics>

I was skeptical about calling 4seating.com because people will over sell you a product tell you how great and wonderful it is and when you get it its a piece of junk. Finally I made the call after looking at the seats for months online and to my surprise the customer service representative wasn't trying to sell me actually I was so nervous I don't think I allowed him an opportunity to say much from all of the rattling that I was doing, Joseph Yarra was the representative he listened to me ramble and when I was done he touched on everyone of my concerns putting my mind at ease making such a large purchase without seeing it first I purchased the Pantheon recliners Big and Tall 400lb capacity and that was one of my concerns was it truly for big and tall after speaking with Joseph he was real knowledgeable about the product he mentioned that some of their clients were from the NFL & NBA that put my mind at ease needless to say I'm enjoying my chairs I would like to add that Joseph was great he was patient took time to listen and was genuinely trying to answer my concerns anytime I had a concern I was able to call and leave a message Joseph called me back I think he even called me back once or twice on his off days< /Text>

I originally called your company to get details of cost of in-house delivery and assembly if I were to purchase a Republic Sofa through Amazon.com.

Joseph not only provided the information requested and, it a very relaxed, non-pressured manner got me to order directly from your company, use your whit glove delivery service, AND  your Guardian 5 Year Extended Warranty!

In short, Joseph provided excellent ,expedient service that surpassed my expectations significantly!

Thank you, Joseph!</text>

<review>If you're on the fence about whether or not you should buy home theater seats you've never sat on, let me help you. Buy them!!! I had the same dilemma and I'm so glad I chose to trust my instincts and purchase these beautiful seats from 4seating. I had visited a couple of high-end furniture stores in my area looking for something nice and within my budget. I found the perfect set, but the price was astronomical. ONE row of 3 seats was more than what I paid for TWO rows of 3 seats from 4seating (when you include the furniture store's cost of delivery and set up)!

So after I concluded that 4seating's price was right, my next concern was quality. I searched the internet for all of the information I could find about Seatcraft as a manufacturer and specifically the Venetian seats I wanted to buy. Everything I read was positive with the exception of the LED lights underneath being a bit too bright. That's a small problem with a few easy solutions. So my wife and I did the unthinkable. We ordered seats we never sat on based only on reviews like the one you're reading now. The end result is me being such a satisfied customer I felt compelled to tell the world. My seats arrived early and in excellent condition. Everything was well wrapped and there were no missing parts. The instructions couldn't have been easier. It's literally ONE step to assemble.

I can't describe how happy my wife and I were when we put the seats together and sat on them for the first time. Wouldn't you know, these seats feel EXACTLY like the seats we sat on at the high-end furniture store I mentioned earlier. And it's the same top grain leather. I assume the price difference is a result of furniture stores having to pay for showroom space, salespeople, TV and radio advertising, delivery and setup staff, etc. If you're looking to save money, order your seats from 4seating and have a neighbor, a friend, or anyone you can pay in beer help you carry the boxes into your home. You'll literally save thousands!

Our sales rep Zack was super easy to work with and very honest. He gave us excellent suggestions! I highly recommend 4seating!< /review><Name>H Balmer</Name><resp>{'time': 1620017763530, 'text': 'Thank You For Choosing 4seating H Balmer.'}</resp>< rating>

Zack, the customer service rep, was awesome. He helped us find the right theater sofa for our family, was friendly, honest, patient and knowledgeable. Woot! Can't wait to get the sofas! Update. Sofas received and in place. These are brilliant. No one leaves my basement now. And not for a weird reason like I’ve locked them down there or something. But no one leaves because they are all sitting on Zack’s sofas in the theater room. These are super comfortable, I love the lighting on the base so we don’t trip. A+.</Review>

Awesome seats!!! Best value for money!!! Alex was very helpful in my decision making process.  I had kinda narrowed down to these 4 row seats.  Alex explained the features and answered all my questions.  I ordered it on Saturday, it got shipped on Monday and I received it on Thursday.  It was very easy to put together.  Very simple process.  We watched the Super Bowl in the new seats.  The lights under the seats give it a elegant look.  Thank your 4Seating!!!<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I wanted to post a quick review on our Apex seats we recently ordered from 4Seating.com.   My wife and I recently converted a spare bedroom to a theater room and I spent quite a bit of time researching seats and  and I finally decided to take a chance on the Seatcraft Apex recliner.  We wanted to get two individual recliners and I called 4Seating and Joseph Ybarra helped me and spent quite a bit of time explaining the various features of the different models and pros and cons of things like the lumbar support etc.   Joseph was super helpful and helped me narrow my choice down to the Apex model.   We love the chairs and the quality has exceeded my expectations, the pictures don't do the quality of the leather justice.   These are super comfy and you power movement is quiet and we love kicking back and watching movies!  Thanks 4Seating and thanks Joseph to turning us on to these seats.  The guys that installed our equipment were also super impressed by the seats and wanted to know where we purchased them.</text>< pics>

I was honestly pretty nervous about buying a seat from here after reading through reddit and other locations. The biggest complaint I read was the delivery time. It did take about two weeks or so, but man was it worth it. I love the sofa I have. One of the customer representatives, Clara, contacted me right after purchasing and wow did that give me the peace of mind I so wanted. She is legitimately the reason I didn't cancel my order and I am so thankful she was there to talk me through everything because WOW I love this couch. It's incredibly comfortable and feels like luxury. I will say that I'm having an electronic issue with one of my headrests, but Clara once again called me up right when I was having the issue and told me they would take care of it right away. I have no regrets and if you are at all on edge, call their customer service - they are top notch people. Clara literally talked to me for an hour about the couch, her thoughts on the delivery process, the quality, and if my dogs would damage it. Truly one of the best customer service reps I've ever talked to. It makes me want to use 4seating for all my home theater needs and you better believe I'll be looking to them first now before going to any competitor. :)< /review>

Service was exemplary!!  Delivery was amazing, and white glove service well worth the money - these sofas are complex to install/assemble, and JP Hunt did an amazing job, tested everything, and left no mess!!  We are blown away by the quality of the furniture, and watching TV in total comfort.<//review>

Great quality as Bob had stated during our sales call.

<Review>My Seatcraft Venetian Theater Seats arrived yesterday and I couldn't be happier. My sales associate Zack Falcon was very professional, patient, informative and helpful answering all of my questions and helping me choose the correct seats for my Theater room and budget. My Theater is not finished yet, but it is fully functional now that I have my seats!<//Review>< pictures>

We bought our theater seats from 4seating.com and were delighted that Zack was our customer service representative. Not only does he know the product inside and out, all his responses were timely and informative. It was our first time buying from this company and he couldn’t have walked us through the process any better. The product arrived within the time frame he said it would, and it arrived undamaged. Zack made it a pleasant experience from start to finish!

<Review>Just wanted to do a quick review for anyone who was a little leery of buying furniture sight unseen.  We could not be happier with our purchase.  Andrew Singas was the rep who helped us order and he made the whole experience effortless.  We let him know the colors of our media room and he recommended the color scheme below.  It matched perfectly!  We went with the Diamante Leather 7000 and the Brown w the Tan Oak. We are looking forward to years of use.  One of the best purchases we have made.<//Review>< Pictures>

It was refreshing to call a company and have a knowledgeable person pick up right away without having to go through automated systems. Joseph was able to answer every question and set me up with the right chairs for our family’s needs. Ended up with the Serenity Tiered and they were exactly as described. Excellent experience.< /Text>

Before I ordered my sectional from 4Seating, Zack Falcon was very helpful and efficient. He thoroughly explained the difference between the different fabrics offered, and immediately sent samples of the fabrics I requested. I recently relocated from New York to Tennessee and Zack understood the problems of receiving mail at a new address that is an area still under construction. So when I didn't receive the first set of samples, he quickly sent another set.  Also, Zack didn't flinch when I changed my original order after I arrived in Tennessee and saw the size of my new living room and the colors used. As a retired technical support technician, I know excellent customer service when I see it, and that's the kind of service that Zack gave to me. Thanks, Zack. I can't wait to see and enjoy my new Seatcraft sectional!< /Text>

Love our new Sienna theater seats!  I called with a few questions before ordering, and Joseph was extremely helpful in explaining how the seats are modular, locations of buttons on the loveseat, and most importantly the lifespan of the different grades of leather. Their customer support is also excellent as they've quickly responded when we received one fewer tray table than expected.< /text>

<text>I am tremendously happy with our chairs.  They are better than what I imagined.  They were easy to bring in and assemble.  Our representative Jesse Valderrama was awesome and realized I had reservations about the delivery.  He assured me that I would be able to handle it and he was right.

I even called him upset about the chairs thinking that there was an error. He was still  very patient  and walked me through the process.  He even didn't laugh at me when I laughed at myself because I placed the chairs in the wrong order.  He probably laughed when I got off the phone, I know I would have.  Sorry about that Jessie.

My wife and I will definitely be using 4seating.com again soon.</text>< Pics>

I did have a small delivery hiccup, but she took the time to contact the carrier and resolve.

I ordered the Vienna three seat couch and a single chair single chair. The products suggested by Clara turned out to be a perfect fit for my space. All of the chairs work perfectly as designed. The product was as advertised as well (the 7000 grade leather). The "White Glove" service was well worth it. So far so good. I'm very picky, but this online purchase actually lived up to the advertisement.< /Text>< Pics>

This is the second theater that I have built using 4seating.com.  The wall acoustic panels, carpet, bass shakers, and theater seats are top quality and by far the best prices you will find.  Joseph took excellent care of me and returned call after-hours and on the weekend.  I look forward to working with these folks on my next project!< /text>

Was delivered just 7 days after ordering!

My expectations were high and my new couch exceeded all my expectations. From interactions with the sales team, to the leather covering, to the steel frame and the comfort! I have never sat on such a great quality piece of home furniture. I would also like to say how wonderful the delivery driver was. At 495 pounds shipping weight, there was little chance my wife & I would get it inside with much ease. The driver helped us get it inside our front door, this was hugely appreciated by both of us!< /text>

Alex was my A+ salesman representative great job in communicating and keeping me posted on product details.    Well-built Recliner chairs and high-quality material. Chair are a bit firm for my taste, I would have loved the chair to be softer on the comfort scale.  Overall these recliners are beautiful and look great in my Theater room.</Review>

(Andrew Singas) is my guy and if you get luck enough to get him to help you with your order you will be that far ahead of the rest. I first started off with Andrew on a order several months ago and wasn't ready to order but the way Andrew helped me understand the different products they offer. I finally push the go button and place my order. He ordered it just like we talked about and it was delivered perfectly.  I would highly recommend going with a product from 4Seating. And try and ask for (Andrew Singas) he will take very good care of you.</text>

I was a little skeptical about buying a sofa online without sitting in it first, but we couldn’t find anything like it at any of our local stores.  After talking with Bob who went over everything in great detail and assured us we were make a good choice we took a chance on the anthem sofa and we love it. Super comfy and we love the power headrests.  We’re very pleased with our purchase.<//review>

I was recently shopping for theatre seating for a screening room but was reluctant to make a large purchase over the internet.  After speaking with Joseph "Joe" Ybarra, he addressed all my issues and answered all my questions.  I mentioned Joe by name because he was extremely professional, knowledgeable and patient.  I ended up purchasing Apex by by Seatcraft along with SoundShaker.

I recently received the theater seats followed by the SoundShaker units a week later.  The quality of the seats exceeded my expectations, and I found the SoundShaker easy to install and setup.

Definitely pleased with the service and the quality of the product!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

My experience in dealing with Mr. Zack Falcon was great! It was like speaking with someone I had known for years. He assisted me in obtaining the exact pieces of furniture I needed, even though they were not specifically listed on the website. Shipping was performed within 24 hours as promised, although it did take several weeks to be delivered.
The "white glove" delivery was as promised with all trash and packing material being removed and furniture set up where instructed. I would (and have) purchased from Zack again.</Text>

Love our new Sienna theater seats!  I called with a few questions before ordering, and Joseph was extremely helpful in explaining how the seats are modular, locations of buttons on the loveseat, and most importantly the lifespan of the different grades of leather. Their customer support is also excellent as they've quickly responded when we received one fewer tray table than expected.< /Review>

Our experience with 4Seating and particularly with our rep, Bob Wheelan, was outstanding. Bob helped me multiple times over the phone to select the right theater chairs for our renovation and was extremely responsive to any questions or concerns.The chairs arrived last week and they are SO comfortable. I may never sit in any other chair in the house again!< /review>

<review>Stay away from this company. All these “5 Star” reviews are bought. This company will basically take your money, deliver a substandard product and not want to send out a replacement part. But they will advertise the same exact product to be shipped out in 24 hours for new orders. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.<//review>< Pics>

I have completed 3 orders within 6 months with Joseph Ybarra and he was EXCELLENT!! He answered all my questions prior to completing my orders and making changes after order was placed. He also showed me how to finance through AFFIRM, which is not advertised on the web site. These orders would have never been placed without that info.< /text>

Zack was great in helping me order the furniture I wanted and also I’m walking me through for qualifying for credit with Affirm. I am greatly appreciative of his knowledge and how personable he was. I will write a review once I receive our furniture in July. I give Zack 5 stars!<//Review>

Professional and trustworthy
What a great shopping experience! Joseph surpassed my expectations during these challenging times. I work for a manufacturer in the .com industry that provides exceptional customer service, answering phones by the second ring. I know what good customer service looks and feels like. I’m happy to say that it has been a joy, working with Joseph at 4seating.
Joseph was professional, courteous, answered my questions to my satisfaction, and followed up when he said he would. My Kodiak chairs shipped within 24 hours and I recieved white glove service delivery within the committed time frame. Joseph made me feel as though my satisfaction as a customer, was of the utmost importance to him. I would definitely shop with Joseph again, and recommend him to others. I would love to have him on my team!

Clara was awesome and so far, we really like the furniture.  The only issue is being 6'-2" tall, we probably should have gone with the Big & Tall line.</Review>

<text>4 Seats and Seacraft was awesome with their service and Clara my representative was great as well. I did have a small delivery hiccup, but she took the time to contact the carrier and resolve.

I ordered the Vienna three seat couch and a single chair single chair. The products suggested by Clara turned out to be a perfect fit for my space. All of the chairs work perfectly as designed. The product was as advertised as well (the 7000 grade leather). The "White Glove" service was well worth it. So far so good. I'm very picky, but this online purchase actually lived up to the advertisement.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Received my Kodiak 4 chair set recently, could not be any happier.  One of the AC transformers was missing, understandable in light of the fact I bought so many gadgets to enjoy the chairs (lights, wine and ipad holders).   Alex was fantastic and had the AC unit shipped to me within a few days.  The chairs are super comfortable and construction is very high quality.   This was the last piece for my home theater, and wow, what a difference having the right chairs makes.  Highly recommended.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dd2abf22c6692b:0x3701429ce3591218< /gmapID>< Date>

<text>Working with Chris Pool was easy. We got the chairs we wanted and they were exactly what we hoped for.  It’s really hard many times to buy things online, but Chris took the time to give detailed explanations on the Stadium seating and quality level of each type.

We are thrilled with our Theatre seating!

< Review>
Bought 4 Equinox theater seats through 4seating recently. Initially, was nervous buying them online. After reading reviews, decided to give it a shot. Whole process was painless. Joseph at 4seating was very helpful and answered all my questions.
Seats showed up good 2 weeks earlier than originally thought. I got the 4 boxes delivered to the garage (standard delivery). Getting them unboxed, moved and assembled was a breeze. Chairs look great and awesomely comfortable. Definitely buy from 4seating again.</Review>

Outstanding experience with 4 seating, and the sales representative was a pleasure to communicate with due to her pleasant mannerism and knowledge level! I definitely would purchase this love seat again because of the quality of the seat, ordering experience, accurate shipping and the white glove experience, and the positive follow-on communication with Clara. Thank you!< /Review>

It's very challenging and somewhat concerning making such a large purchase virtually.  Zack was very helpful, informative and quite patient.  I not sure if I would have made this purchase had it not been for Zack's exemplary customer service.  The sofa is exactly what I expected, high quality, solid construction, great features, and very plush/luxurious.  I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy this sofa for years to come.</Review>< pics>

<Text>We recently purchased four seats from 4Seating.  Everything to this point has been very good.  We worked with Zach ... who did a great job in talking us through a number of options, including delivery, fabrics, arrangements, etc.  If the reviews on the product itself are an accurate reflection of what we will get ... this will be a good experience.  Our ship date has come way sooner than expected.  Not sure if this is a matter of underpromising and over delivering intentionally ... but who cares?  We’re excited to receive these earlier than expected.

It has now been over a month since we have been using our seats.  We still love them ... and continue to learn more and more about them.<//Text>< Name>

<review>We love the sofa; it a one of a kind piece of furniture. It can be two recliners with a table or a couch to lay down on. The insertable tables are a great addition.  We purchase the Seatcraft Vienna Brown Leather 7000 Power Row of 3 Sofa with Drop-Down Table, and this product is of high quality. The customer service was outstanding, from ordering the couch from Clara Hinojosa to using the white glove to assemble it.</review>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Text>My experience in dealing with Mr. Zack Falcon was great! It was like speaking with someone I had known for years. He assisted me in obtaining the exact pieces of furniture I needed, even though they were not specifically listed on the website. Shipping was performed within 24 hours as promised, although it did take several weeks to be delivered.
The "white glove" delivery was as promised with all trash and packing material being removed and furniture set up where instructed. I would (and have) purchased from Zack again.<//Text>< Pics>

I have completed 3 orders within 6 months with Joseph Ybarra and he was EXCELLENT!! He answered all my questions prior to completing my orders and making changes after order was placed. He also showed me how to finance through AFFIRM, which is not advertised on the web site. These orders would have never been placed without that info.< /text>

My experience was amazing and easy going. Andrew helped me make the right choice in seats for our family and guests. Between the sound shakers and the comfortable features the Equinox seats are the best we have ever sat in. Movies are definitely more fun! Thank you 4Seating and thank you Andrew Singas. : )</review>

Our experience with 4Seating and particularly with our rep, Bob Wheelan, was outstanding. Bob helped me multiple times over the phone to select the right theater chairs for our renovation and was extremely responsive to any questions or concerns.The chairs arrived last week and they are SO comfortable. I may never sit in any other chair in the house again!< /Review>

< Review>
Bob, our sales rep, was super helpful. He made really astute suggestions and made sure we understood how the loveseat functioned and the features/limitations so there were no surprises. We really love the loveseat. It's super comfortable. It was the perfect size for our limited loft space. And those snap in snack trays are awesome. They are much nicer than I expected and quite sturdy.<//Review>

Really good experience ordering online from 4seating! Talked to and ordered from Zack on September 16 and he was very helpful with product information and quite candid - and accurate - about shipping dates. He said that our theater seating would not ship until approximately October 21st (but actually shipped a week earlier) and we received it today - on October 21st. (In this "order today and your stuff will arrive tomorrow"-type of online buying many of us are used to - the shipping date initially seemed a bit far out, but it turns our we needed those weeks to get our space organized and ready for the seating.) The shipping company was also friendly, prompt, and careful in delivering to the curbside. Our chairs were very safely boxed/packaged and were as easy to set up as Zach told us. All of the electrical components seem to work just fine (and there's a surprise USB port on the chairs!) and the chairs are very comfortable. We will have to see how the "gel leather" holds up, but it looks good and hopefully will be easy to wipe clean. We originally thought about choosing the manual controls, but are very glad we went with the power recline - so great to have a huge range of possible reclining positions. No hesitation about ordering again in the future from this company - we're happy customers!<//review>

We chose the Seatcraft Diamante chairs in two-tone leather and couldn't be happier.  The service and attention to detail at 4seating is first class.  Our customer service rep, Joseph Y, was wonderful to work with and made the experience very pleasant.  He was professional, responsive,  and very knowledgeable.  We highly recommend 4seating and recommend you ask for Joseph Y.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrmXOEUF9FkPBQyHnA7TAosj7Zy0CqTiXEM0gC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzG8GHTsXjTE6P0a8cgOGKbEuvWBNbf_8FPVDn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYCznmqTXxwMptaHPA6pDKrtVi5SPOQmOxmo3S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1592221170097, 'text': 'Hi Tracy, thank you for your feedback and thanks for endorsing 4Seating.com'}</resp>< GmapID>

<text>First and foremost I want to give a huge shout out to Zack for all his expertise in helping me pick out the perfect chair. With all the different styles and options offered I have to admit I was really confused as to what would fit my needs. Zack was able to ask me questions as to what I wanted and by the end of our in depth conversation, we had decided on the perfect chair for me. We then discussed options to add or not to add and as far as I am concerned, we hit a home run. I have used the chairs for a couple days now and although it may be a bit early to assess the chairs, I just couldn't wait to tell you how happy I am with them. I find it hard to believe there is any disappointment coming my way so I am just going to give the 5 star rating right now. Even the guys that delivered and set up the chairs were top notch. Thank you Zack for an incredible experience and thank you for all your help!

Sincerely,

Shawn<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1609226754181, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing 4seating.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

Chris Pool was very helpful. We wanted a set of couches that would get here in a hurry. He helped us with the diamond print couches and they were in my living room within a week and a half. Thanks Chris for the help. These couches are comfortable and we love them.< /review>

Our Seatcraft Vienna theater sofa was delivered today. The quality of the sofa is excellent and the optional white glove delivery service is very much worth it. Customer service from 4Seating was excellent when we had questions about the shipping/delivery schedule, and we were also able to get tracking updates from the freight carrier as it made its way across country to our home.  Super happy with this purchase!<//text>

There were numerous discussions with virtual website touring (during Covid environment). In the end we were very pleased with our decision. The chairs are wonderful and ideal for our bonus room. The delivery and set up crew was very meticulous and had everything set up in our special room within 20 minutes. Overall it was a great experience. Highly recommend for 4seating to everyone.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>We purchased a row of 4 of the Seatcraft Equinox for our new theater room. Bob Wheelan was our sales representative. The seats are awesome and so was Bob! He was extremely professional and helpful along the way and was quick to assure us that a little issue upon delivery would be taken care of. (It ended up not being an issue at all, but it was assuring to know that Bob would’ve done everything necessary to make it right). We highly recommend 4seating and Bob!!< /Review>< pictures>

Recently purchased Monterey theater seats. My wife and I were looking to purchase new theater seating replacing the cloth seats we had for about 15 years. My wife found 4Seating online and saw that they had a large selection and were seemingly reasonably priced.
When we called to get some questions answered, we started working with Alex. He was very helpful, yet not pushy at all. Very much appreciated! Over the course of a few weeks and a couple of calls, Alex gave us pros and cons on the models we were looking at and some alternative options. Eventually Alex helped us identify the right seats for us at the right price. We bought 6 units of the Monterey model. We selected the dark brown leather that works wonderfully in our theater room. Love the way they look and feel. Definitely recommend the Monterey, Alex, and 4Seating for your theater seating purchases.<//review>

Bob from 4seating was an incredible help. He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful the whole process.  I am glad my wife and I spoke with him before ordering.  Bob helped us order exactly what we wanted and the product did not disappoint.  We opted for four individual chairs instead of getting a loveseat or sofa.  This gave us versatility in our small living room area.  The chairs are amazing and are exactly how Bob had described them.  Customer service gets five stars. Product gets five stars.  I would highly recommend this company and Bob to anyone in the furniture hunt!< /Review>

We absolutely love our new sectional from 4Seating.  We were a little skeptical with marking a purchase this large and not seeing the product in person but we received great help from Jessie Valderrama.  He answered all of our questions and made us feel at ease with the purchase.  We got the Seatcraft Entrada model with the Soundshaker package.  The furniture is very well made and the leather is very comfortable.  The Soundshaker upgrade puts it over the top.  We’re very happy with everything about the furniture. Highly recommend Jessie and the folks over at 4Seating.

Beware the loveseat configuration does not have the advertised recline/usb port on one if the seats in the loveseat config, its a single seat with no attached armrest and small controls way below seat onside.  There is no usb as advertised and the buttons which are show on the armrest for easy access are actually 6 inches below the seat level on the side between the seats. Have to shove your hand far down between the seats to access and can’t see so very hard to find and select button you desire. Have to separate chairs to even access the controls at all leaving a gap between chairs. Trying to return the one seat with no side for one with a side with the advertised controls. So far told no as I’m at 34 days past receipt... didn’t set up chairs right away due to room being under construction. Hoping manufacturers warrenty will cover or company will ship corrected chair. For now removed the chair and using in a 3 seat configuration  so I have waisted $1000 on this one impossible to recline seat seat. Ordered the Monterey back row, 4 seat, loveseat configuration. Will update rating if chair is exchanged to meet advertised product.<//Text>

Great experience with 4seating.  Andrew Singas was especially helpful in assisting me figure out the exact chair I wanted and needed.  Nice that someone cares about me getting the right chair vs a quick sale!  Definitely would order from them again.< /Review>

<text>Chris Pool and 4Seating are wonderful! Chris made sure I was informed about my purchase, warranty, and shipping protocol. And these seats...DIVINE!! I got the Seacraft Cuddle seats with ottomans and they’re well made, impressively sized, and cozy as heck!!! I assumed the pillow that came with it would be dinky, but I was wrong! It’s a gorgeous and quality pillow. All in all, we’re VERY happy with our experience!!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>We have nothing but good things to say about our experience with 4seating. Our Seatcraft Helios seats are super comfortable. Bob helped us select the best fit for our home theatre. We love the power headrests. The order arrived quickly. We paid the extra fee to have the units set up and it was money well spent.<//Text>< Pictures>

Horrible customer service. I paid extra for the white glove delivery which promised that the local agent will contact me within 2 business days of receiving the product to set up a delivery date. 1 week later and 4 frustrating phone calls to 4seating, still nothing from the delivery agent or any information on the delay. I was told today that most likely the item has “just been sitting in the warehouse for a week” and was never checked in. When asked if I could receive a discount on the high delivery cost for the mistake, was told that wasn’t possible. Will definitely not order from this site again. The same items can be found all over the web so don’t waste your time or money with 4seating.< /review>

<review>Great customer service.  I worked with Bob who was knowledgeable and genuinely helpful with great advice.  Excellent product - we love our theater seats!  We ordered one row of them for our theater and after just a few weeks we've enjoyed them so much we are ordering another row.  It really makes movie night feel special with our family and friends.  We have the Seatcraft Venetian chairs.  They fit our space perfectly, the leather is nice and comfortable and the power recline is way fun.  These don't have the power headrest which would be nice but that is more expensive and we find that neck pillows work great if you want to recline further back and keep your head comfortably forward.  The led lights are fun too, but not really practical in a theater room because they are so bright.  I wish they were much dimmer or had a dimmer control as simple as low/medium/high/off setting when you push the button.  That would be practical and probably easy to implement. Something for Seatcraft to think about if they ever read this.    That's a minor complaint and not enough to take away any stars.  If you are looking for theater chairs I highly recommend this company and their products and their great service.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZSNXXeq4qS0uk9YeL27-DU-yLwY7eaKnubwrS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIBEGS8UbO2iCtCemp83WjLHoJllq6-A7BAJrt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3EtvpMY108CRRcd4_xuqh8uBInGHG-EWSUOCO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Joseph Ybara was excellent to work with.  When I originally purchased we were looking at a delivery time of mid May but they came first week of May.  The packaging was excellent and the delivery company put the boxes in my driveway and they were very courteous and careful.  Set up was easy and the best part of this purchase was my wife saying we need to buy a bigger TV!  :). Thank you 4Seating and Joseph for an excellent experience!<//review>

<Review>Love our new chairs (we got the Pantheon model). They are super comfy and really high quality. The soundshaker is a really nice feature. Chris Pool was the guy I worked with at 4Seating, and he was super responsive and great to work with.  They forgot a reading light in my order, I emailed Chris and he responded within a few minutes to say he will send it out.

< review>
We wanted a quality leather recliner for my husband's Man Cave.  He found your site and decided on a chair.  Clara was extremely helpful and recommended a different chair than the one we were going to buy, because my husband is 6'4".  We took her advice and he LOVES his chair.  Delivery and putting the chair together was problem free. He really loves the adjustable headrest.  The leather is beautiful.  Now he says we need to buy a couch for the family room.  Thank You Clara!</review>

Purchased four Seatcraft 7000s with middle loveseat configuration.  These chairs are excellent for not only just relaxing, but for watching a screen.  The power recline and power headrest help to situate your head and body at an optimal viewing angle.  The 4Seating representative, Alex Osorio, made the selection and ordering process very smooth.</text>

We are extremely satisfied with our sofa and love seat from 4seating!! Prior to our purchase, we didn’t see any specific reviews of the set we were interested in: the Seatcraft Cavalry set in the Big & Tall section, so we hope this helps the next customer. Our representative, Andrew Singas, was there for us the entire time as we contemplated making this large purchase, sight unseen. He answered all of our questions, concerns, multiple calls & emails to assure us that we were completely satisfied with our decision. Now on to the sofa & loveseat: WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! It’s solidly made, high quality leather and other materials, the powered lumbar feature is outstanding! It’s incredibly comfortable and the functionality of the tray tables is something that we didn’t even realize we needed as much as we did. We use them for our laptops, snacks, and eating while watching movies. I wished I would have also ordered the wine glass caddy because this is my favorite place to relax at the end of a long day. We are a family who uses their furniture and I am sure this will last us a long time.< /Text>

<Review>buyer beware, purchased two rows of 4 sienna seatcraft 7000 in november 2019. the seams on 2 of the seats have completely come apart in a little over a year with minimal use. 4seating not interested in dealing with situation as the "one year warranty" has expired...expected much better quality for the price paid.

in response to the reply below, we did call customer service and we were told there was nothing they could do.  we called the manufacturer and were told the same thing. the chairs received were clearly defective to have this happen to 2 of them in the same exact spot while barely a year old and hardly used. if you would like to discuss to try and work something out, please provide a proper contact number for me to call, as we didnt get anywhere with the customer service number</Review>< pictures>

We are delighted with the quality, comfort, appearance and features of our black leather Seatcraft Vienna Sofa. Jesse from 4Seating provided excellent customer service. He promptly answered our questions by email and telephone, both before and after out purchase.

Note that it is possible to set your preferred footrest, back support and headrest combination using the middle button in each set of controls. We use a power strip for the 5 plugs that power the sofa's many features. Because the base was very heavy, we wish that the $99 delivery and set-up service had been available.</text>

The chairs themselves are great, couldn't be happier with them, but the delivery process was a cluster.   I was told mis-information by multiple parties throughout the process.  I ended up cancelling delivery and arranging to pick-up the chairs myself because delivery was delayed 6 weeks longer than my set expectations.</review>

4seating customer service team exceeded my expectations when trying to find a resolution to problems from the manufacturer.

Wrong orders were filled from the manufacturer, but 4seating reps reordered the correct chairs and offered me a discount for the delay in getting the correct order.

I purchased the Seatcraft Diamante chairs.  The chairs are very comfortable and the controls for the power seating and lighting are easy to use.  Very happy with the product!</review>

I found this place online while looking for a four seater sofa with recliners. I called and spoke with Jesse Valderama and he emailed me several options that met my criteria. Jesse was awesome and I would rate him 5 stars for his customer service. The four seats arrived in extra large boxes on a horribly dilapidated pallet that needed several blocks to stay upright. The product has a lot of room for improvement and therefore I believe it is highly overpriced. The swivel tray tables don't allow for a glass to be in the cupholders at the same time. The controls (lumbar, headrest, etc.) are not in an ideal location on some chairs. The placement and location of both of these items could have been much better. Some of the seats arrived with some scuffs and blemishes. Lastly, they are made in Vietnam so take that into consideration when considering craftsmanship and quality control. I would rate the product a 3 out of 5.

Update: 3/25/21
Customer service reached out to me and made things right. They are sending me several leather repair patch kits and a new arm rest to replace the defective one. They are definitely committed to customer satisfaction. The one downside is that I have to wait quite a while to receive the replacement items.<//text>

My 4 Seatcraft Monterey Home Theater Seats arrived today as promised.  I ordered them via Clara, an excellent customer service representative from 4Seating.  She was courteous, informative, low-pressure, friendly, and was able to reduce my white glove delivery and set-up charge by 75%.  The delivery company received the chairs within about 4 days, and emailed me to set up a delivery date.  They arrived on the agreed upon date, and the install went perfectly.  All 4 chairs were in perfect condition, and are very comfortable and fit exactly as I expected within the space available.  If I have any more home theater furniture/accessory needs, I will not hesitate using 4SEATING.COM because they have a very wide selection and many price points to choose from. Their prices are reasonable for the quality of seating options they provide.  Thank you.<//Text>

<text>Just ordered a custom power reclining sofa from 4seating and the sales agent I worked with, Zack, was so helpful by email and then phone to finalize the details.  He is friendly and happy to answer any questions and explain product options. He also follow through on every detail.   Crucially, he is familiar with the details of the actual product and has used them himself.  The experience was light years better than ordering from your typical call center where the person answering the phone doesn't know anything about the actual product.  Now just waiting 8-10 weeks for the custom couch to be made and delivered, but the ordering process was as painless as it can be!<//text>< UserId.>

Here's the deal. The company messed up my first order. I wasn't very happy. However, they did fix the issue and the seats I received are amazing! I did have to wait an extra couple weeks but in the grand scheme fo things,  I was more than satisfied with their supplied resolution. I'd recommend them to a friend.< /text>

Probably one of the easiest purchases I have ever made.  I spoke with Joseph and told him what I was looking for.  He made several recommendations and I decided to go with the Veloce. I had the chairs in my home theatre a week later.  The chairs look awesome, quality is top notch.</Review>

< review>
UPDATE 25AUG20: So we got the brackets today 25AUG20. No instructions. No video, and again, we paid for the installation and no time set up. We have been waiting since the day it was delivered originally on the 14th of August so.......that's been 11 extra days. NOT GOOD!

--------------------------------------------------------

Great couch! The best part is that you can pick and choose what layout you want and what best suits your style/needs. All the items we chose is what we wanted and it is fantastic. My brother called it the RV of couches meaning it is just super comfy and has all the amenities you need for that long trip of binge watching Netflix, reading a good book, or gaming.

Biggest issue I had was delivery. It was good but they didn't bracket the couch together so for now the pieces are sliding apart. I even asked the delivery team and they said, "It doesn't bracket together". This was odd because I was told it was supposed to. I paid for this service to be installed and delivered and feel that I definitely did not get my money's worth seeing that I have to now wait for the brackets and most likely have to do it myself.

Zack was very helpful and I have been counting on him to make all the support throughout the process.<//review>

<review>I called 4seating after browsing there website and talked to Chris Pool. He helped me with the ordering process and selected the right chairs that where instock and would arrive before Christmas. My initial selection was vanican and with calling to talk to Chris over the phone he told me the shipping date would be late January. I'm glad he mentioned the upgrade to the Serenity because not only were they were instock and shipped next day but also the chairs are very comfortable and cushy. I'm happy with my experience with 4seating and Chris Pools customer service. I will order from them again.<//review>< user>

I recently purchased seats from 4seating. I called with questions about the seats, the size of the seats and various other questions about the seats which the sales agent Joseph was very helpful addressing. I was able to get the right seats for our setup. It was a truly easy process and Joseph was a big help. THANKS! Photos to come soon!</Review>

Joseph at 4seating was incredibly helpful in discussing and getting us into the right theater chairs that were best for us, our home and our situation. There were numerous discussions with virtual website touring (during Covid environment). In the end we were very pleased with our decision. The chairs are wonderful and ideal for our bonus room. The delivery and set up crew was very meticulous and had everything set up in our special room within 20 minutes. Overall it was a great experience. Highly recommend for 4seating to everyone.< /text>

Just ordered my 2 rows of Seatcraft Rialto theater seats from Zack.  Very courteous, professional, answered all my questions.  Service is expeditious. I received an email with the quote while on the phone as well as emails confirming my order and explaining the shipping process before our call ended.  Can't wait to add the seats to my home theater!   Zack is The Man!</text>

Outstanding! The quality of their seats are outstanding. The seats we purchased were durable, beautiful and well made. It completely changed our living room theater. Everyone comments on how beautiful and comfortable our seats are. We did a ton of research before purchasing and are so happy we went with 4seating. Dario helped us pick the proper seats and configuration. We went with the Enigma seats and they are so comfortable and beautiful. Relaxing reading a book, watching a movie or enjoying time with friends, we can sit on these seats all day and be comfortable.</text>

<text>Bob was a fantastic, customer oriented Salesman.  I appreciated his professionalism and recommendations when asked.  He was concise and when the seats arrived, they were everything he said they would be.  The quality of the seats were better than expected and have made a wonderful addition to our home theater.  I was, at first, wondering if red would be an eyesore.  However, once in place, I believe they provide the perfect offset to complete the room.  2 Thumbs Up Seatcraft!!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9_drqSHsc1i6asbhktW505KmN4mpu9KWF2Shp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm2hP20spMXAoCeyCPegt2Gv8cQbxj8DoWfQQj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

Bob, our sales rep, was super helpful. He made really astute suggestions and made sure we understood how the loveseat functioned and the features/limitations so there were no surprises. We really love the loveseat. It's super comfortable. It was the perfect size for our limited loft space. And those snap in snack trays are awesome. They are much nicer than I expected and quite sturdy.<//Text>

Alex Osorio of 4Seating.com sold us the Equinox Cream theatre seats and we love them. They arrived yesterday with white glove delivery and were set up in less than 30 minutes, replacing a 5-year old set of Seatcraft seats still in condition but a different color.

These seats are well built, with adjustable headrests and lumbar supports. They include USB plugins in each seat. The lighter color makes our room brighter-the other seats were black, and we added a fourth seat. We use these daily for casual viewing, although we have a dedicated home theatre room with overhead projector for serious stuff. It is hard to go back to a sofa once you get used to home theatre seats. And Alex is a goldmine. He really knows which seats have which features-don’t spend endless hours on the website without talking with him.

I LOVE the seats--very comfortable and luxurious. Great experience and great product. Cannot recommend more highly from start to finish.

<text>Absolutely love our new theater seating. Bob Wheelan was wonderful to work with. Would definitely buy from 4seating again and would recommend them to everyone. Bob made sure all the details we needed covered were taken care of and followed up to make sure delivery was smooth. If the rest of the room went together as easily as the seating I would definitely post a picture.<//text>< Time>

I have been looking for movie seating for some time and found 4seating.com online.  I was very skeptical in ordering seating online without the ability to test out the seats.  However, after talking with Joseph Ybarra from 4seating, and reading several reviews, I decided to move forward.  Working with Joseph was awesome!  His customer service and responsiveness were top notch! He was very helpful and knowledgeable and made the entire experience a breeze.  As for the chairs, I purchased a row of 4 and a row of 3, of the Seatcraft Venetian Black Leather.  I could not be more pleased with the quality and comfort of these seats.  Definitely exceeded my expectations!  If you are thinking of making a purchase, please give Joseph a call at 4seating.com, you will not be disappointed.  Thank you Joseph!</text>

<Review>RIDICULOUSLY POOR SERVICE!  1st issue was shipping to HI but I can accept that as I often hv similar problems when buying from CA.  Jesse calls me & needs to revise the estimate with additional shipping.  No prob.  However, I specifically ask if he processed original order on my credit card & ASSURES me he did not. He then sends me email with revised estimate to which I give him my credit card information.  Then he calls me back & says he didn't realize there is no white glove service in HI so he has to send me a 3rd estimate. Guess they have never shipped to HI. I again ask if he processed the 2nd order on my credit card & ASSURES me he did not.  I finally get correct order submitted on 3/10, with a 3/24 ship date.  Chairs are in stock but the small 60"x 70" by 7" riser needs to be fabricated & he can't send the chairs ahead of time as that would be a separate shipping charge (to which I decline). I will wait for the 3/24 shipping.  Then he calls back & tells me my credit card won't go thru, so have to give him a different credit card.   Come to find out he DID charge my credit card on the 1st order (but not the 2nd order) & the 3rd order put me above my limit.  Now I have to work with Jesse to get the 1st order charges reversed.  Fast forward to 24th I do not get an email so I email Jesse.  No reply.  Email again on 25th.  No reply.  I call on 25th and speak to Angela.  I explain the situation & she tells me she doesn't know why my order says it will be shipped by 24th & Jesse should know better.  Someone should have called me if my order was going to be delayed or at VERY least Jesse should reply to my email.  I ask if there something she can do.  She says no, the fabricator who is located in the same bldg is backed up.  She tells me the order she is looking at says shipping date will be 4/2. I ask her to send me an email to document the 4/2 date which she sent immediately.  She doesn't offer a discount for my troubles, doesn't offer to send the chairs ahead of time, nothing.  Perhaps better customer service training would help and/or elevate problem orders to a Manager who might be able to be more helpful.  DISAPPOINTED!!!

UPDATE 3/25/2021 101PM HST:  Jesse sends email reply "It looks as though your order will be shipping out on Monday.  I apologize for the late response."

UPDATE 3/29/2021 7:04PM HST:  Did NOT get a call or email or any other notification that my order shipped. I sent an email requesting a status update.  No reply

UPDATE 4/2/2021 4:30PM HST: Did not get an email notifying me my order shipped today (4/2). So assume it wasn't.   I sent an email earlier today to Jesse asking for update.  No reply

UPDATE 4/5/2021 10:50AM HST: No response from Jesse, so I call & was able to again speak to Angela.  She remembered  my case & I reminded her she told me on 3/25 it would be shipped on 4/2.  She informed me the order was STILL waiting on the riser but will be shipped by end of business tomorrow (4/6, 4PM PST).  I asked for her Mgr's name but she would not give the Mgr's ext#.  If I do not get an email by tomorrow EOB informing me that my order was shipped, then I can call back & ask to be transferred to her Mgr.  (Lyn). At 12:13PM HST I get an email stating my order shipped

UPDATE 4/12/2021 9AM HST: Did not get tracking info that it shipped.  I call & speak to Brittney.  She agrees that there is no link for the tracking and needs to speak to shipping coordinator who is out to lunch but will call and or email be by EOB.  No reply

UPDATE 4/14 9:20AM HST: Called & spoke to Megan.  She agrees there is no link for the tracking, and spoke to shipping coordinator & gets me a tracking link that works with Aloha Freight.  ETA 4/20

UPDATE 4/20: Received my complete order.  Found 1 smallish blemish in backrest but otherwise the chairs were packaged nicely and in great condition.  The chairs themselves are great quality and look beautiful

SUMMARY: Seatcraft chairs are high quality.  Customer Svc was about the poorest quality I have ever experienced.  If you can buy Seatcraft from somewhere else, do it< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This is the second time I order the Rialto series seats from 4seating.com.  Again I was not dissappointed.  I will also add that my Salesman, Joseph Ybarra exceeded my expectations and handle all my questions beyond the sale.  I had a different ship date post to what we agreed to and Joseph worked and got it resolved within the hour.  Great work!<//Text>

< Review>
First, I am particular and expect excellent customer service from anyone I am ordering goods from.  Zachary Falcon exceeded all my expectations.  I called to get answers and help as we were ready to order chairs for our new media room. Zack knew the product well, gave me options, answered all my questions and added information I had not considered. My intention was to obtain information but I felt so comfortable I ordered all the chairs, paid for them, and can not wait for the delivery. Zachary listened and we laughed and discussed my options.  Do you know how hard it is to get anybody to listen? I am retired but IF I was still working I would steal this employee away from you! When the conversation ended and he scheduled the delivery, I felt I had a new friend. I wanted the chairs by August 8 when that wasn’t possible, he was so gracious, I was willing to wait.  Please tell Zachary thank you from our whole family!!  And thank you for making my ordering experience the BEST!</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I began looking for a replacement recliner and came across the 4seating.com website and the theater seating recliners. I was very impressed with the look of the Seatcraft Diamante recliner from the moment I saw it and the features that were included. I called 4seating.com and spoke to Zack, who was very helpful. I was a little reluctant to buy a piece of furniture without actually sitting on it but Zack assured me that it was a very comfortable recliner and very well made. He also said if I wasn't happy with it that I could return it within 30 days. I decided to make the purchase and I am more that happy with this recliner. I like the fact that it has a powered adjustable head rest that allows you to recline and adjust your eyes to the optimum level. The Diamante has met all my expectations and I would recommend this to anyone that has an inclination for a quality theater seating recliner.< /Text>< pics>

Zack was great at handling a lot of my questions pre-buy and then made the purchase and delivery process very clear. Couldn't have gone smoother between research and final buy. Theater seats yet to be delivered, so only grading the buying experience.<//text>

WE bought 8 chairs for our home theater from Zack Falcon @ 4SEATING.COM.
Zack provided outstanding service.  When we had a  minor hiccup with the delivery of 4 of the chairs he immediately  jumped in and found a solution that eliminated  the issue.    The chairs look great and are very comfortable.
WE highly recommend Zack Falcon @ 4SEATING.COM.
5 stars!

It's always a pleasure to talk to a salesperson who goes to that place where you don't feel like you're being sold. We are all consumers especially here in America. But I can say without a shadow of a doubt I was most pleased with this company. Zack, thank you so much for your patience and helping me find what I needed at a reasonable price. I look forward to my delivery but I will say you made this experience very pleasurable and honest. And I know I was probably a pain but your patience and then a whole lot and helping me find what I wanted.<//text>

The chairs themselves are great, couldn't be happier with them, but the delivery process was a cluster.   I was told mis-information by multiple parties throughout the process.  I ended up cancelling delivery and arranging to pick-up the chairs myself because delivery was delayed 6 weeks longer than my set expectations.< /Review>

I researched theater reclining couches before contacting Jesse Valderrama. I was very surprised and completely satisfied with my purchase. I bought the Seatcraft Octavius big and tall sofa 🛋.  It was delivered faster than I expected. It was simple to assemble.  4 large pieces, and very easy wiring connections.  This was more than I wanted to spend, but I have no complaints.  This sofa is great, I would definitely 👍 purchase again.< /Review>

<Text>Just ordered a custom power reclining sofa from 4seating and the sales agent I worked with, Zack, was so helpful by email and then phone to finalize the details.  He is friendly and happy to answer any questions and explain product options. He also follow through on every detail.   Crucially, he is familiar with the details of the actual product and has used them himself.  The experience was light years better than ordering from your typical call center where the person answering the phone doesn't know anything about the actual product.  Now just waiting 8-10 weeks for the custom couch to be made and delivered, but the ordering process was as painless as it can be!< /Text>< pictures>

The process and phone call was seamless.  Andrew Singas walked me through every aspect of my room and gave me a thorough & honest opinion based off of my wants and what I was envisioning.  In times where good customer service is difficult to find, I would give Andrew 6 stars if I had the ability.<//review>

< review>
I have been searching for a pair of theater seats for over two months. I did lot of home work and finally decided to go with 4 seating. When called, I was referred to the sales person Andrew Singas. Andrew was very knowledgeable and helpful in finalizing the chairs I am looking for. Following Andrew’s recommendation, I decided to go with a pair of Seatcraft Diamante Black Leather 7000 Power. The delivery and set up was no brainier. Both chairs are of exceptional quality and very comfortable. We are planning on buying a set of 5 theater seats for our home theater from 4 Seating. Of course, I will definitely ask for Andrew as my sales rep. Kudos to Andrew!< /review>

<review>Here's the deal. The company messed up my first order. I wasn't very happy. However, they did fix the issue and the seats I received are amazing! I did have to wait an extra couple weeks but in the grand scheme fo things,  I was more than satisfied with their supplied resolution. I'd recommend them to a friend.<//review>< user_name>

<time>1617721188272<//time><Rating>3<//Rating><Text>I found this place online while looking for a four seater sofa with recliners. I called and spoke with Jesse Valderama and he emailed me several options that met my criteria. Jesse was awesome and I would rate him 5 stars for his customer service. The four seats arrived in extra large boxes on a horribly dilapidated pallet that needed several blocks to stay upright. The product has a lot of room for improvement and therefore I believe it is highly overpriced. The swivel tray tables don't allow for a glass to be in the cupholders at the same time. The controls (lumbar, headrest, etc.) are not in an ideal location on some chairs. The placement and location of both of these items could have been much better. Some of the seats arrived with some scuffs and blemishes. Lastly, they are made in Vietnam so take that into consideration when considering craftsmanship and quality control. I would rate the product a 3 out of 5.

Update: 3/25/21
Customer service reached out to me and made things right. They are sending me several leather repair patch kits and a new arm rest to replace the defective one. They are definitely committed to customer satisfaction. The one downside is that I have to wait quite a while to receive the replacement items.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1615846138112, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.

<text>Andrew Singas was highly knowledgeable about all the seating options and a pleasure to work with!   Seating should be here is 2 weeks!!!

Update - Seating arrived in 3+ weeks.  White glove delivery was deficient in that they sent only 0ne person to move the seats upstairs.  4 hours later two movers arrived and all went well except what appears to be silver ink lines in many places on the leather.   I have left three messages over the last week for the salesman with no answer!   Actually got an answer a couple days ago via email which went to spam for some reason.

I am supposed to buy some leather cleaner to remove the marks that were "for shipping"  !! ??

Seats are very firm and I am hopeful they will soften up with use.
The tray design sucks!!!  It is not possible to put a soda can in the same arm as a tray!  All would be OK if you have separate seats (not attached)
I may have to fabricate some new ones.

If I had been able to try these out before purchase I would not have forked over big bucks< /text>< rate>

Needed a quality set of home theater chairs on a tight budget with quick delivery and was about to give up when I found 4Seating.  Spoke to Bob who was probably the most knowledgeable sales person I ever spoke to and he recommended the SeatCraft Venetian.  They were exactly what we needed, comfortable, stylish, and well made, everything he said they would be and more, thanks Bob.</Text>

My husband called to get information on products available. Alex was extremely knowledgeable about all the seating you had to offer. He explained the differences between styles, the difference in quality and pricing and helped us make a decision that would suit our needs the best. We are very pleased with what we have received thus far, and are awaiting our final piece. Everything Alex explained to us has happened as far as shipping notifications and deliveries. We couldn’t be more pleased with your products or his help, knowledge, and service.< /review>

<review>I called 4seating after browsing there website and talked to Chris Pool. He helped me with the ordering process and selected the right chairs that where instock and would arrive before Christmas. My initial selection was vanican and with calling to talk to Chris over the phone he told me the shipping date would be late January. I'm glad he mentioned the upgrade to the Serenity because not only were they were instock and shipped next day but also the chairs are very comfortable and cushy. I'm happy with my experience with 4seating and Chris Pools customer service.

Bought 4 Napa home theatre seats with some great help from Alex of the customer service team back in Jan 2018.  These seats are super comfy and of great quality.  Alex convinced me to buy extended warranties on the seats, which I intend to use for a very long time.  But with the seats still in such great condition - almost new, I kinda regret that I spent the extra money.</Text>

Thanks again Joseph..< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>4seating is a great company I purchased my 1st set of theatre seats from 4seatings and they are great My Salesman was Joseph he handled everything He helped me with the  Seat configuration I purchase 2 sets of 3 seats with love seat on the right He also help me with the overall length of the seats to fit in my particular area I ordered the Diamanti seats They were special order I change the colours to black and grey, The seats are nice and firm It has the blue lights in the cupholder and underneath  It has the power head rest which is a must for anyone to get that looks fabulous. Joseph was there with me anytime I called him if he wasn't there he will call me back and let me know the status of my seats They look  and feel fabulous only thing about special order it takes a while to receive your seats I live on the East Coast the seats were shipped from the West Coast in California only thing I can think of that was bad was the delivery service from California to Ohio When they were delivered to JB hunt  Delivery service here in Ohio everything was fine  JB hunt delivery service call me and told me what day and time they would deliver my furniture and they were right on time, But again 4seating is a great company Joseph is the (MAN) And I will recommend them to anyone who are looking for theatre seating.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjhLQtOpLX5V9lxpTxrVMBO1KxsdMsijzZCKLO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnMzGgtCLYfxBSlzJJ-ONiV8O2sXwTF6g2uYqv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLuFskpoAleS-6jtZ8I-JhLBTJMPLZDifZBKFy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

I just completed my order with 4seating and it wouldn't have been possible with out Josephs grade A customer service. I had items in my cart but utilizing his knowledge of their various products he was able to set me up with a better layout for my desired project. Many thanks to Joseph and to 4seating for making my dream home theatre possible!<//text>

We bought a Calvary, big and tall sofa from Seatcraft and salesperson Andrew Singas.  The sofa is everything it was advertised as and more.  It appears to be a very high quality product and we hope to enjoy many years of use.  Andrew is one of the most pleasant phone salespersons I have encountered.   He answered all my questions and made the process very easy.  We had an issue with the timing of the delivery with the carrier because of Covid19 problems and Andrew and Seatcraft customer service responded immediately and resolved the problem.  I highly recommend both Andrew Singas and Seatcraft.< /review>

I ordered my first sofa from 4seating about 3 years ago. I got it within a few weeks was soo easy to put together. It is still currently in our living room and in amazing condition. Between dogs, kids, food, and all kinds of other things, the leather has held up amazingly. I love it so much that we just order a new sectional for the living room and will be moving the one we have to our game room. Great company, they have been very helpful through the ordering to assure we got good measurements for our area.</text>

The overall experience with 4seating was great. Jesse was very helpful with all of my questions. I've had my new sofa for a week now and love it. It is quality made. The accessory integration is seamless. I ordered the wireless phone charging holder but it did not come with the sofa. I called and they had it in the mail that same day. I will be using 4 seating for my future purchases.</Review>

< review>
I had been shopping for theater chairs for the past 4 months until I ran across the Seatcraft Serenity chairs.  They seemed too good to be true so I was a little worried about them not being high quality or comfortable but after speaking with Bob at 4Seating (who was super helpful) I was pretty sure they were the ones and took a chance.  When they arrived I could not believe the quality and comfort, the leather is soft and the chair is even better than I expected. I highly recommend them, you won’t be sorry.</review>

Alex was very helpful in getting us pictures, information and quotes. He also showed a lot of concern to be sure we got the correct pieces of furniture for our particular needs. With his help we selected the Equinox 3 seater sofa with all power. We are thrilled with it and all its amenities. The color Bordeaux is beautiful.</text>

<Name>Demerius Ware</Name><review>Zack was wonderful assisting in every way possible to make sure we got just he right furniture at as agreed. We have not received the furniture, so I can not comment on that. He gave us a final shipping date which is far better that Value City Furniture which was less than cordial and unresponsive. Thank Zack. Can't wait to get the furniture.< /review>< gmapID>

Jesse Valderrama, my salesperson was extremely helpful in the ordering process and even help place an order for 2 additional chairs that we found we had room for.

Again, from start to finish it was a 5 star experience!

<text>Bought 4 Napa home theatre seats with some great help from Alex of the customer service team back in Jan 2018.  These seats are super comfy and of great quality.  Alex convinced me to buy extended warranties on the seats, which I intend to use for a very long time.  But with the seats still in such great condition - almost new, I kinda regret that I spent the extra money.< /text>< Rating>

I just completed my order with 4seating and it wouldn't have been possible with out Josephs grade A customer service. I had items in my cart but utilizing his knowledge of their various products he was able to set me up with a better layout for my desired project. Many thanks to Joseph and to 4seating for making my dream home theatre possible!< /text>

It appears to be a very high quality product and we hope to enjoy many years of use.  Andrew is one of the most pleasant phone salespersons I have encountered.   He answered all my questions and made the process very easy.  We had an issue with the timing of the delivery with the carrier because of Covid19 problems and Andrew and Seatcraft customer service responded immediately and resolved the problem.

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I bought a straight set of two Equinox and the sound shaker amp from Alex. They were delivered within 3 days! Alex was awesome, very helpful. He eased my concern about the weight of the chairs and how to best get them in the basement.

The Equinox are very comfortable, the leather is rich with high end stitching. I was blown away by the sound shaker, the effect is awesome, with my 135 inch projection it’s better than going to the movie!

Thanks Alex!< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I love my two new Equinox chairs in red. They came about 4 weeks earlier than estimated.  Because i live in an apartment building i requested White Glove delivery. The delivery company was spot on with the time 8:50 am for a 9 -12 delivery window. The two men were courteous and fast.

Unfortunately the USB port on one chair stopped working on the first day. The following day, i called my Sales Agent, Clara Hinijosa from 4Seating. She was her usual cheery self and told me a service agent will call me within 24 hours. Great customer service!</Review>< Pics>

It was a great experience to purchase 6 home theater Seatcraft chairs with the help of Bob Wheelan. We got additional accessories with the help and assistance of Alex Osorio. This is an outstanding company dedicated to making sure their customers get the right product and they enjoy the experience of watching movies at home. I did end up spending more money than initially budgeted, but I applied the all saying of "buy once, but right". The Apex leather 7000 in brown color is like a business class seat, or I should say it is even better than those, even the flat beds. Besides the recliner part, it has neck and lumbar support. Both features are really worth it as you can adjust your view to the screen for all body sizes and shapes. An added feature is the sound shaker subwoofer that comes with the unit. You will need to purchase a separate receiver that works with up to 4 chairs, so in my case I had to buy two for the 6 units. A 7-2 home theater with vibrating chairs gives you the ultimate experience. All my friends want to come over to watch movies. You should see their faces when the action starts to kick in and the chair starts to vibrate. They all say the same ”I need to get a similar set up in my house”. I never write reviews, but I think it is worth putting a good word for the quality products sold by 4seating.com, and their excellent customer service. Both Bob and Alex were extremely knowledgeable about all their products and their features. They will be able to supply you with a great product that fits your needs and budget. My home theater is still a work in progress, as I have only installed the chairs and the movie pictures on the walls. I need to paint the walls and install sound panels to minimize the reverb. You will be hard pressed to find a better product, they seem to be the gold standard and the only game in town. Drop them a call and let them help you.<//review>

Excellent overall experience!!! When I contacted 4SEATING.COM , I had the pleasure of dealing with Customer Service Representative Alex Osorio who is a true asset to his company. He was a wealth of knowledge, knew the answers to all my questions with no hesitation and gave me the honest pros & cons of numerous different media seatings.  Alex was very patient, and did not pressure me at any time. At the end, Alex recommended the Seatcraft Venetian
Brown Leather 7000 Power Curved Row of 5 Media Recliners. I waited  a few weeks to write the review to be sure that everything was as promised. I received my Seatcraft Venetian recliners as I was told. I purchased the extended warranty and white glove delivery and it was well worth the money , the delivery experience was perfect with no issues .
Alex was totally spot on,  the recliners are solid , the Italian leather is quality , electronic reclining  mechanisms work great , very comfortable and are overall an excellent purchase. My family and I have been really enjoying the recliners  in the media room . Alex went above and beyond to make sure that my experience and needs with 4SEATING.COM were met and I must say they definitely exceeded my expectations.  Thank you Alex !!< /Text>

We loves these seats!  Have had them for about two years now. The leather has held up really well through our daughters sleepovers, movie nights and football Sundays!  Most comfortable seating we have and love the headrests!  4seating has the best selection. We looked for months trying to find chairs that would fit in the space we needed. I wanted 4 chairs with cup holders but wasn’t having any luck with the length.  Finally I found 4seating which had the perfect fit.  When you buy your chairs make sure to get the trays we use them everyday. Attached picture isn’t when they were brand new it’s today. That’s how good they still look. I didn’t get the sound shakers when I bought them so I called today and Alex explained in detail how to instal them and talked me through it all over the phone. Great seat! Great service! Can’t wait to add the shakers.< /Text>

Great customer service!  I just placed an order for 2 rows of premium theater seating, and the process could not have been easier.  Zack answered every question I had, and at one point he showed me another website where I could get a better look at the color options. No putting me on hold, no running to ask a manager. He knew everything. That is what I call top-notch customer service.  I wish other companies were as forthcoming.</Review>

<Review>This company is phenomenal, particularly Bob who walked me through the ordering process! The quality of these chairs is unbelievable, I ordered Seatcraft Monaco in brown with cherry wood trim. Matches the new woodwork perfectly!!! I pinch myself every time I walk past our New theater room, it’s just beautiful!
Thank you Bob and 4SEATING.com!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

The Seatcraft Omega sofa arrived, in perfect shape, earlier than expected & was an absolute breeze to put together. It's really beautiful!

One of the best and easiest purchases that I ever have made.  My sales representative Zack, was very informative and knowledgeable about the products and assisted me from the initial order to the final delivery.  I couldn’t have been more pleased when my chairs arrived with quality and the easy assembly, I highly recommend this company for all your theatre seating needs. A+++++</text>

<review>11/23/20 update - after posting the review below I received a call from Lynn in customer services. She was extremely kind and understanding and worked with me to find a solution that made me feel fully heard and appreciated as a customer. Thank you Lynn for being so helpful!!

I took a risk in ordering a Seatcraft theater sofa from 4Seating.com without being able to try out the sofa first. The sofa looked nice upon arrival but we immediately realized it was too firm and uncomfortable to use daily. We were really disappointed. Fortunately, we could contact 4seating to take advantage of their satisfaction guarantee. Right? Wrong. I discovered that buried in the fine print on our receipt is verbiage stating there is a 30% restocking fee plus we must pay for packaging and shipping. Cost to us? Almost $1,000 to return an uncomfortable piece of furniture. All because I took the risk to order it online. My bad. Lesson learned. Don't be like me. DO NOT order furniture online from so-called reputable furniture companies. They are not. They will take advantage of you like they did me. Go to a local furniture store and buy from someone you trust. Even if it costs more. In the long run it will be much, much cheaper.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>We received our chairs in late April and we absolutely LOVE them!!
We spoke with Andrew Singas, one of their customer service representatives and he was extremely helpful.
He answered all of our questions and he was very patient.
He also knew all the details of each model so he was able to help us select the model that fit all of our needs!
I would definitely recommend this company!
Thanks again!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1592415817374, 'text': 'Hi Marc, thank your for endorsing 4seating.'}</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Jesse was very patient and helpful.  We took about 3 months to make a decision, comparing various different chairs from Seatcraft and other companies.  We selected the Equinox line and are very happy with our choice.  Jesse kept in contact during our decision process answering any and all our questions.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I love my two new Equinox chairs in red. They came about 4 weeks earlier than estimated.  Because i live in an apartment building i requested White Glove delivery. The delivery company was spot on with the time 8:50 am for a 9 -12 delivery window. The two men were courteous and fast.

Unfortunately the USB port on one chair stopped working on the first day. The following day, i called my Sales Agent, Clara Hinijosa from 4Seating. She was her usual cheery self and told me a service agent will call me within 24 hours. Great customer service!< /review>< Rate>

Zack helped me with my order.  He was very knowledgeable about the products available and which one suited my limited space situation best.
He provided a detailed quote showing two options immediately and had the quote available quickly when I called back to place the order.  He was very courteous and helpful with delivery times as well.<//review>

<Review>It is my pleasure to write about my experience with Zack Falcon at “4 seating.” I have been looking for a couch for several months now.  I spotted your Aspen chairs and knew my looking for a couch was over.  I have to say, it wasn’t the chairs that won me over.  When I heard they wouldn’t be in until Sept.  I  had to think twice about purchasing the chairs.  It was Zack that sealed the deal for me.  Here is why.  Right from the get go, he was friendly, had a positive attitude, was informative and answered all my questions.  He then said he would check back in two days. Which he did.  I couldn’t have been happier with my experience and can’t wait for our chairs to arrive.  You are lucky to have someone with such high caliber.

After getting a new 65" TV I started researching home theater seating options. I came across 4seating.com and was immediately hooked! So many models, options and configurations. The website was very easy to navigate and browse. My girlfriend and I decided on a Vienna sofa and put it in the cart. We were waiting on our stimulus and unemployment money in the meantime. I received a very friendly call and voicemail and email from Clara a few days later.  She offered her help and wanted to know if I had any questions. I emailed her back once we received our stimulus monies and inquired into a few things. Clara promptly replied and gave me all the info I needed to make my selection.  We actually ended up upgrading our selection to the Omega sofa! Power recline, power headrests, super cool stitching, fold down middle table with USB ports, AC outlet and wireless charging! I must say the Omega was an awesome purchase...worth every dollar! it has completely transformed our entertainment experience! We love the look, the comfort and convenience of the Omega. We don't call it a couch...we say its our Multimedia Sofa! We will surely enjoy the Omega for years to come! Sheltering in place during this Covid19 pandemic has never been so comfy! I highly recommend 4seating.com for your home theater seating needs. Thank you Clara for all of your help. Stay safe everyone!<//text>

Very good at his job and was there every time I had a question. And helped me at getting the right seating for my cigar lounge. I’m pretty sure I will be happy when I get them. Thanks again and I look forward to ordering from your company again.

Thank you Chris Patterson

These seats are amazing and at a really good price !  The perfect touch to any home theatre . My family and friends all love it . My buddy has the best home theatre system with an outstanding projector but he is like a kid at the candy store when he comes to my house . Those seats make all the difference . Alex Osorio was a pleasure to work with . He guided me in choosing the right seats and was always available to answer any of my questions even had his repair team contact me when I needed a part that was defective . They couldn’t be more apologetic and even offered to have a tech come replace it  . I wanted to get the back row that they offer where you don’t need a riser but instead of just selling it he asked me how wide my doorway was to my basement and immediately told me it would not fit . That’s great that he wasn’t just being an order taker it saved me from a huge mistake . I couldn’t imagine having to send those back as they are heavy due to being well built . If you’re thinking of getting theatre seating ask for Alex !<//text>

<date>1587689446323</date><review>Outstanding experience...wonderful products and a superb salesman, Joseph Ybarra.

We were looking for stadium seating for
our media room.  We connected w Joseph at 4Seating thanks to the recommendations of our decorator.  We were sold when Joseph explained the outstanding functionality on the seating.  He suggested we visit a local show room to try the seats out.  Remarkable!

My wife and I were sold immediately when we saw and gave the seats a try.  For $6300, we have a host of outstanding new furniture to enjoy our new big screen projection TV.  Their white glove delivery service was also wonderful placing and setting up the seats and we bought the extended warranty offered at a reasonable price.

Only issue that marred the experience for my wife and me, was the indifference and difficult to work w customer service department.  We had the unfortunate experience of working w Richard Valdez and seriously thought of canceling the sale because of our poor experience w him.  His unhelpful and uncaring attitude was disgraceful for a store offering such fine products.  While we never connected to Lynn, the manager, we decided to keep the product despite Mr. Valdez’s poor people skills.

The product is awesome and so too is Joseph!  If you’re in the market for some outstanding seating, go visit Joseph who knows how to work w customers, meet a customers needs and cultivate good will.

Thank you 4Seating for having Joseph on your team and having superior products to sell.</review><Rate>5<//Rate>< pictures>

<Name>Awookiee< /Name><Review>I purchased 3 of the Seatcraft Diamante line of seating and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  I was skeptical ordering online having never seen or sat in them before but their associate Alex Osorio was extremely helpful and answered every question I had.  I first contacted him about a year and a half prior to purchasing the seats asking some initial questions and he was extremely helpful even though I told him it would be about 2 years before I was ready to buy.  He never once pressured me into buying them before I was ready and I am very appreciative of that.

The seating itself is extremely comfortable and to begin with I questioned  whether powered headrests were necessary but ended up getting seating with them.  Very thankful I did as it makes all the difference in the world when you recline in the chairs.  The 7000 series leather is very high quality and I know these chairs will last a long time.

I also purchased the add on Soundshaker amplifier as the seats have the seatshakers preinstalled.  It's something that takes a little fine tuning but adds a lot to the experience.  If you've ever gone to an AMC Dolby theater, this is very similar to what the seating there uses to shake slightly anytime the frequency (Hz) hits the point you have it set at with the amplifier.

All in all I would highly recommend 4seating to anybody lookin for theater style seating.  I obviously can't attest to the longevity of the chairs as I've only had them a couple weeks now but I know these are built to last.  Alex Osorio was a pleasure to work with and I already have 2 neighbors jealous of my chairs and will likely be purchasing some in the near future.  I will definitely recommend they talk with Alex specifically.</Review>< Pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>The worst experience I have had buying furniture online. I purchased 2 rows of seating over the phone from Joseph. I thought he was great and seemed to be knowledgeable and was even giving me some extra accessories for free. I made my order on 5/06/20. They claim they will ship the furniture out the next day. I got a shipping notification with tracking information, but here we are on May 28th and I still have not received any furniture and no one seems to know where the shipment is. Now they are saying they must have lost the furniture and it would be at least another 10 days to get new ones if they shipped them out. What a waste of time! I wouldn't buy from this company at this point. They haven't been helpful or informative. I have called and emailed many many times with little to no answers. The only person I feel bad for in this is Joseph because he was helpful and probably makes commission.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Horrible customer service! I placed an order a month ago and it was shipped next day from California to Las Vegas. I believe the shipment of the chairs are lost and no one from the company has told me anything. I’ve been asking for weeks for them to check the status because the tracking information shows it was never received from the carrier. I’ve reached out to the sales person, management, and customer service. Someone will respond periodically saying they will look into it and never get back to me. This is ridiculous, they are quick to take over $6,000 but cannot check on your order. I really don’t know what else to do to get my chairs or my money back. There is another company that sells same products with same prices so look elsewhere< /review><name>Jennifer L<//name><date>1601962489212<//date>< Rate>

Ordered these chairs with the help of an extremely nice fellow named Alex. We ordered 8 Bonita chairs.  They are fully electrically adjustable, usb port, lighted cup holders and chairs, and 8 trays that can be stored in the under arm storage area.  The price was fantastic, quality exceptional and service spectacular.  Thank you Alex!<//Text>

Let me start by saying I shopped around for the perfect theater seats and 4 seating surpassed my expectations. I dealt with Joseph Y a true professional and very knowledgeable with his product. After doing extensive research we purchased the Venetian power recliner seats with LED lighting and tables.  We received our seats today and inspected everyone. The packing of these seats was outstanding. The leather seats are beautiful and soft. We are extremely happy with our seats and can’t wait to watch movies/football games in our theater. We are almost finished with our theater  and will send pictures when we are done. Joseph we would like to thank you for being honest and sincere with your product and we can’t wait to receive our carpet in a couple of weeks.
I would highly recommend Joseph Y and 4 seating to all my friends and family.

Regards,

The seats are so comfortable and easy to adjust to our individual liking's, and my wife really loves the color combination I selected, so I'm getting lots of praise from her.  And as you know, we love our theater seating so much, we decided to add an additional storage unit for better relaxing capability for our guests.

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I found 4seating by doing a google search on Movie Room Chairs, and this was the first place I started looking.  Good thing is because this place provided all the support and good prices I needed.  I read some reviews really quick and all reviews were very good (they mentioned Joseph Ybarra).  I don't base my preferences off other reviews, but I was in unfamiliar territory, and needed some advise at the minimum.

I have a smaller movie room that cannot accommodate normal seating.  So I shot an email to the customer service email, and happened to get a very quick reply from Joseph Ybarra.  Joseph sent me several options that would fit my movie room, and answered all my questions.   At this time, I was still unsure of my purchase.   I now fired up the ole google search engine, and compared what Joseph sent me (just for my own sanity).   It wasn't long till I realized I initially contacted the right company (4seating).   Now I was ready for the purchase.

I called and spoke with Joseph on the phone, and we went through all the details needed.   Nothing at all (not even the seats) were pressured, Joseph just provided the information I needed.  I happened to see an option regarding SoundShakers, so I asked Joseph.   Joseph advised that this provides a great movie experience by enhancing the base from within the seats.  Since I don't have a large movie room, I thought this would be a great addition, so I included those on every seat.

Only "issue" I had was it took a little over a month to get the seats (which is totally understandable, and they installed the SoundShakers on all the seats).  I was just being impatient.

Got the seats and had the delivery install same, again, great service.   The instll took about 2 hours and they went through everything with me (expept the SoundShakers, as they hook up to my receiver, and they cannot be responsible).   Again, totally understandable, and this gives me a little pride in part of the installation.

The seats are more than expected.  I got the Seatcraft Napa.   These are very comfortable seats that have electric head rest, which I initially thought was a waste, but completely not, once I was able to experience different head rest positions.    The chairs also come with great accessories, such as the table and cup holders (I didn't have cup holders in my previous seating - because of the size of the room).  The lights in the seat are also an awesome feature.

Anyhow, summary - 4seating is a superb place to shop for movie room seating.  The customer service is top notch and something that is hard to find now-a-days.   The customer service alone would want me to purchase from them, but then you add on the great prices, comfortable selection, and massive options, you cannot go wrong with 4seating.</Review>< pics>

I have been searching for a pair of theater seats for over two months. I did lot of home work and finally decided to go with 4 seating. When called, I was referred to the sales person Andrew Singas. Andrew was very knowledgeable and helpful in finalizing the chairs I am looking for. Following Andrew’s recommendation, I decided to go with a pair of Seatcraft Diamante Black Leather 7000 Power. The delivery and set up was no brainier. Both chairs are of exceptional quality and very comfortable. We are planning on buying a set of 5 theater seats for our home theater from 4 Seating. Of course, I will definitely ask for Andrew as my sales rep. Kudos to Andrew!<//text>

<Review>Just got my theater seats a month ago from 4seating. We love them.  Exactly what we wanted.  A month in, noticed one of the Tray mount holders  was loose and not working properly.  Called them after hours, immediately got a person to talk to and walk me through the options. Took some photos, they called me back the next day with options for a fix.  It was such a simple fix, they walked me through it on the phone and I did myself in less than 5 minutes.  Thanks so much for the personal assistance. Very responsive and easy to contact for any reason. No recordings or run around.  Excellent customer service.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>UPDATE 25AUG20: So we got the brackets today 25AUG20. No instructions. No video, and again, we paid for the installation and no time set up. We have been waiting since the day it was delivered originally on the 14th of August so.......that's been 11 extra days. NOT GOOD!

--------------------------------------------------------

Great couch! The best part is that you can pick and choose what layout you want and what best suits your style/needs. All the items we chose is what we wanted and it is fantastic. My brother called it the RV of couches meaning it is just super comfy and has all the amenities you need for that long trip of binge watching Netflix, reading a good book, or gaming.

Biggest issue I had was delivery. It was good but they didn't bracket the couch together so for now the pieces are sliding apart. I even asked the delivery team and they said, "It doesn't bracket together". This was odd because I was told it was supposed to. I paid for this service to be installed and delivered and feel that I definitely did not get my money's worth seeing that I have to now wait for the brackets and most likely have to do it myself.

Zack was very helpful and I have been counting on him to make all the support throughout the process.< /review>< Date>

The Omega couch is extremely comfortable. I had a problem with the headrest staying up, but I called Alex, and he took care of the problem immediately. The couch is amazingly comfortable and has excellent lumbar support. I am a short person, so my legs don't reach the floor. however, that doesn't matter because I prefer the reclined position. Very comfortable!.<//Text>

<username>power88kenny<//username><Text>We were looking to turn our living room into a home theater and discovered this couch through 4seating.com.  I called and talked to Jessie and he was very helpful in explaining all about it and we decided to get it.  It's rather heavy to get in, but two or three people should be able to get it out of box and assembled (don't try with just one person).  The couch was even better than we had hoped and we're considering getting the loveseat that matches. Here's a pic in our house where we built some custom framed boxes for movie posters and we think it turned out great!  We also added a popcorn machine.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd2abf22c6692b:0x3701429ce3591218</gmapID>< Time>

I ordered 2 sofas from 4seating. There is a delay in shipping due to COVID. We were informed about the delay and have been very satisfied with the customer service at 4 seating. Our salesman was Zack Falcon. He answered every question and ensured we were given the proper attention to satisfy our needs. Can't wait to get our new furniture!<//Review>

<text>Chairs themselves are great.  When ordering, initially wanted one certain set of chairs. Was told was on back order.  So instead of waiting months for it to come in, ordered a more expensive and what we were told was an IN STOCK alternate set. Paid for it and waited. Never got email saying it was sent. Called the company back and was told it was ALSO on back order. Frustrated since we only chose that one at that point due to the fact that it was in stock and we wouldn't have to wait. Customer service was very nice. And upgraded us to yet another version of the chairs that was actually in stock, but sadly had to forego the lumbar function that we had wanted instead of waiting for months.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>We received our home theater chairs and all I can say is WOW!!!! The entire process from ordering to setup took less than two weeks! Joseph Y was the rep who answered our call to initially inquire about 4seating chairs and he answered all of our questions with such professionalism and had lots of patience for all of our questions. He guided us to purchase the Seatcraft Grenada series which is exactly what we needed for our party room in our barn. Joseph Y is a top notch rep!!!! The chairs arrived and are put together. They were easy to assemble and are of super high quality. We will be purchasing more in the near future for our game room. I give 4seating, Joseph Y, and this entire process a double thumbs up 👍🏻 👍🏻< /text>< Pictures>

I've never ordered a sofa on line before.  Ordering was easy, the delivery date was spot on,even came earlier than expected. The shipping box was almost bulletproof.  This sofa is more than I thought it would be. Fit, finish,quality all rolled up in one package. I probably will order another soon. Thanks for the help from Joseph.</review>

<Review>Bob Wheelan is remarkable!  He is the best sales guy I've ever worked with... And that's saying alot as I'm a sales guy myself for over 15 years.  His follow up, follow through and patience shows.  His passion also shows and you can tell he is the authority in the theater seating world.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! :)</Review>< Time>

Joseph Y has been such a pleasure to work with.  I purchased the Seacraft Venetian 7000 Grain Leather and I cannot wait until they arrive!  Joseph was patient with my initial indecisiveness, answered all of my questions, and even made recommendations for exactly what I was looking for.  I will re-post once the chairs are delivered!< /Review>

OMG!!!!! My experience with 4seating customer servicer Alex Osorio, was so awesome!!!
Alex Osorio,  who works for customer services was so patient with me, he took out so much time and effortlessly to help me.
By sharing with me as we brows the 4seating website together. Which made  my shopping experience a lot more easier to choose the right home theater chairs to fit my budget and living space. I was so impressed with all of his help and knowledge on my choices, The Monterey home theater chairs were my final selection. I am extremely excited. Alex, thank you again for being so helpful and patient with me. You definitely get 5 stars from me. Whenever I decide to make another purchase from 4 seating again,  I am going to request for you and your help again. Customer services means a whole lot to me. I hope that this 5 star review goes to upper management, and that Alex,  is giving something special for such a well done job. Happy customer that I am. Thanks Alex Osorio. KUDOS!!!!< /text>

<text>I’d like you to know that I”m a very happy and satisfied customer of 4Seating coz Clara has rendered an “Excellent Service.”
She has provided the special features of all the sofas in a 7000 grade leather that I requested.
I’m so glad that she attached a 5-year Extended  Warranty of the sofa for my review.
We decided to purchase the Seatcraft Anthem
Sofa with the warranty.
You’re the Best Professional Sales Person I spoke with.

Buy locally!!
Purchasing from 4seating was a big mistake for us.  We wanted to and were willing to pay for high quality furniture.  Our first love seat arrived with the armrest bent and out of line.  The center console was built on an leaning forward angle.  Drinks fell out and fell over due to the center console being on a forward leaning angle.

4seating was great, they apologized and told us to keep the poorly build original love seat and they sent us a brand new one at NO COST.

We received the 2nd love seat.  However, to our dismay, the 2nd couch had the exact same problems as the first.  We made contact with 4seating, however, after several attempts, they ignored our emails.  I believe their attitude was you paid $2800 for two love seats, we are done with you and screw you.

We tried to sell the love seats for $1200 a piece to somewhat recoup our investment and purchase quality love seats but unable to get any takers.  So, we are stuck with 2 love seats that you would buy from the "clearance center" or "slightly damaged" or "scratch and dent" section of a store.

We just wanted a quality comfortable love seat and were willing to pay the price for this as you typically get want you pay for.

Disappointed, we should have stuck with LazyBoy.  Also, the seatcrafts are made in wonderful China so beware of the quality.</Review>

<Review>I was pleasantly surprised at the terrific customer service from 4seating and in particular Bob Wheelan.  Bob was very cordial and informative and took extra effort to research questions and provide answers.   I purchased the APEX in a curved configuration, and the soundshaker was a nice addition for our movie experience.   High grades for Bob and 4seating.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Very frustrating experience thus far. Received a call after 7pm for a delivery scheduled for 8am the next morning canceling.  Next available appointment was 1.5 weeks out. I called 4seating to see if I could get standard delivery faster as I have upgraded to white delivery and no one from customer service was available today and the sales person couldn’t help.< /Review>< pics>

Great seats and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

Very happy with my purchase and the white glove service that I opted for to set them up.  One seat did arrive damaged, but accidents happen.  I can say that because of the outstanding customer service (Thanks  Richard!!!) they provided, with a replacement that shipped out the next day!!!

Great job - I highly recommend this company!!!< /text>

Using her personal experience to help me  choose. Our choice arrived in top condition and we Love our Red Anthem Loveseat with Center Console.

Tracking  on Echo was right on but one shipping Company dropped the Ball so tracking was halted because scanning was not done. Customer service with 4SEATING an ORBO  Corp. namely Angela made it all right with a manager getting  involved!

<review>I was very skeptical about purchasing site unseen a leather sectional. After researching other options I decided to take the risk and ordered with the Seacraft Entrada brown leather 7000 power configuration  with Chaise, 2 consoles and additional recliner. Joseph did an excellent job and answered all my question and follow up questions after the order was placed. I was pleasantly surprised when the product was ready for delivery way ahead of schedule.  I used the White glove service who  delivered on time, setup, and removed all packaging.  The quality, comfort, thickness and softness of the leather exceeds my expectation. I highly recommend this company and product.< /review><username>Sean P<//username>< GmapID>

I have been researching for a home theater seating for a while and so I decided to stop by their warehouse showroom. I went in with a seat style in mind and left loving another one. Dario there was very great showed me around and was very knowledgeable about features and chair characteristics. While I did like the one I had in mind going in a lot, Dario's expertise and taking my height and body (6'2 250lbs) into account left me loving a different model entirely. The drive down and visit was definitely worth it to make the right choice for home theater seating (firmness, features, extension length, etc).

I highly suggest anyone considering a chair give them a call to get to a feel of what we can only see online through specs.</review>

I recently purchased the Seatcraft Vienna Sofa 7000.  Andrew Singas was our representative who guided us through the process  He was very knowledgeable and patient with me on the phone, answering my questions and concerns.  Thank you, Andrew 1st class service.  The delivery and setup were the most critical part of this process for me as I live in the Midwest, far away from their manufacturing center.  I'm happy to report that because of how the couch was shipped, protected padding and in a box, there was no damage what-so-ever.  All of the mechanisms and electronics worked out of the box, no complaints.  This is by far the best furniture purchase I've made.  Thank you to 4seating.com and Seatcraft for a wonderful experience.< /Text>

<Text>We bought the Vienna from Alex at 4seating.com.  It is very adjustable which makes it comfortable for my 6' 2" husband and for my 5' 5" self. The middle section with  the extra cup holders, lighting, power and USB ports, and wireless  charger works well for us because we are both working from home.  I love the arm storage because I can store the accessories (light and small table) along with some odd items like a box of klneex and nail file out of site but still close at hand.  There is an additional USB port in each arm along with individual adjustments for  head, lumbar and feet. I like that the foot adjustment can be set any where from completely down to straight out and anywhere in-between. This seating unit also possibility of using a memory preset so once you find the perfect settings you set the preset and then you can get the setting you like by only pressing one button.  The leather and stitching look substantial but because we have only had it a few weeks l can't speak to the durability yet. My only problem is with the cup holders. They don't accommodate a regular coffee cup because of the handle on a coffee cup.  Easily fixed by putting a piece of fabric in the bottom of the cup holder. We use this as our regular sofa and are very happy with it. Alex was very easy to work with, answered all our questions and responded to any of our calls. Buy this you will enjoy it. And it is do easy to care for.</Text><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>113190971552875942329</UserId.>< gmapID>

However, one just had what seemed to be a mechanical issue and the frame seemed to be broken.  Definitely wasn't neglect as we baby the chairs.  Maybe I'm too fat😁.  However, I contacted customer service and spoke with Richard.  Richard forwarded my video and pics of the damage on to his supervisors.  They will now be shipping out a new chair!  I have to say I am highly impressed with their proactive effort.  Richard was a great help and took care of us.  I highly recommend and will use again if needed in the future.<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
UPDATE: We had to return the SeatCraft beautiful power reclining loveseat TWICE, due to damage in shipment. Now after 4 months since we placed the order, we have cancelled it. NOTE, my assessment is this is NOT 4Seating's fault. It is clear in both cases that the long-distance trucking company removed some protective packaging and the pallet, and very poorly handled this very heavy (and expensive) couch. I am leaving the 5-star rating, as I want to acknowledge the truly GREAT customer service and support by 4Seating's supervisor, Ms. Lynn Meza. I do suggest however, that 4Seating reevaluate its shipping partners and find ones that will properly handle their beautiful products. We lost getting a great product, and 4Seating (and SeatCraft) lost a large order.
I want to acknowledge the excellent experience I had with 4SEATING.com, and ESPECIALLY with their customer service agent, Joseph Ybarra. With Joseph's help, I purchased the Seatcraft Colosseum Loveseat. I highly recommend 4SEATING.com and Joseph Ybarra.< /review>

<text>Joseph Ybarra, the sales agent, has been great to work with.  He helped me find exactly what we were looking for.  A theater loveseat without a center console. We are looking forward to receiving our new Seatcraft Pantheon seats.  I will post photos upon arrival of the furniture.  :)

This is an update on the Theater seats purchased from 4Seating.  We were fooled by the promise of "Ready to Ship".  It took six weeks for the seats to arrive.  When they finally did, we realized that a "row of two loveseat" is in fact two separate chairs pushed together, not a loveseat at all. Then, one of the seats was defective.  The "white glove" delivery team had us accept the delivery and referred us to 4seating. I promptly contacted Joseph, who referred me to Customer Service.  I sent an email, describing  the problem and was contacted 24 hours later.  I was asked to send a bunch of photos and video of the issue and after two days of discussions we were told a replacement chair would be sent.

Another six weeks later, the "white glove" delivery team picked up the defective chair and proceded to set up the replacement chair, which -  was defective as well.   Still no lumbar support, still no working lights.

In order to connect the light strip, the 'white glove deliver team' fully reclined the chair that had been working until then, connected the light strip, which shorted out the light strips and the cup holder lights on both chairs, AND the chair that was working until then, is now NOT WORKING at all. In fact, it remains in a fully reclined position with the headrest fully extended.  We did not want to accept delivery of yet another defective chair, but the "white glove" delivery team simply left without our signatures.

I promptly contacted Joseph again, who again referred me to customer support.  I again emailed photos, described what happened and ... NO RESPONSE for days.   It took a second inquiry regarding the status of my email for a customer service rep by the name of Lynn to call.  Lynn was very kind and empathetic and told me that they would have to order replacement parts...  Why do I have to wait for replacement parts on a purchase of NEW CHAIRS??   She assured me that replacement parts will resolve the issues and I was to call as soon as the parts arrived so she could schedule someone to come do the repairs.

I have since received an email announcing delivery of replacement parts sometime in January of 2021.

In the meantime, we have two defective theater seats sitting in our media room, one of which cannot be used at all.  I have not been able to receive any feedback from a person since I have voiced my dissatisfaction about the lack of customer support.

I have purchased two NEW theater seats in Septemeber 2020, and to date, I have received two defective chairs and one chair that failed - and still we wait.< /text>< Rating>

Very positive experience with my Seatcraft Bonita in a chocolate microfiber. Zack was very helpful in helping me narrow down the selection and giving a lot of useful guidance.
We had a little delay with the final shipper, but that was out of 4Seating’s control. When they did arrive we found the white-glove service to be well worth the expense in getting 6 seats to our 2nd floor theater room.
We had a disastrous experience with our previous theater seating. It was bonded-leather which is well known for self-destruction.  We wanted something that would stand the rest of time.
Even though 4Seating offered top-grain leather options, we wanted to stay away from leather in its entirety this time. The microfiber cloth was an interesting option. We’ve only had it a few days, but find it very comfortable and a great match to our decor. The reclining functions all operate smoothly and the blue LEDs perfectly compliment the other lighting we’d already had installed.<//review>

Well, little you know, these chairs started peeling off, I thought it was just the kids scratching it but nope, not even close.

Very happy with the exceptional customer service provided by John Jasso.   John went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure we were taken care of after having issues with a console and arm rest on our love seat.  He was very responsive and reliable.  His word was golden.  He did what he said he would do and we are thankful for his top notch service!< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Totally unsatisfied! Ordered a row of 3 recliners, then decided to purchase 2 cuddler seats which ship out within 24 hours. I also attached comments in my purchase, advising my first order so they can be shipped out together. They replied saying “Got it.” Shipping day came and only the row of 3 recliners came. We called about the 2 cuddlers. The rep stated there was a note to ship all items together. His excuse was the rep put the comment in but left home for the night, “so no one saw it.” The next morning no one cared to look at the comments. On the website it clearly states...” Order by 2pm Sunday - Thursday and we will ship your home theater seating within 24 hours. Orders placed on Friday or Saturday will be processed the following business day. Orders placed the day prior to a national holiday will be processed the following business day.” I placed my second order at midnight Wednesday into Thursday. So there was enough time to have it shipped out within the 24 hour period. They tried to ship my cuddlers out 5 days later. I cancelled my order. What is the point of the 24 hour flash shipping, if it will come 5 days after estimated delivery date? They tried nothing to have my cuddlers delivered to me on time, even though someone on the companies side dropped the ball. Horrible customer service! A $4,000 order you would think they would at least try to satisfy their customer.  They did absolutely nothing to try to accommodate me.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1595620060407, 'text': 'Hello Manny. Thank you for your feedback.

<rate>3</rate><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Review>It’s been not a very good experience with 4 Seating and my order placed end of Nov as it is still not delivered. Estimated delivery was for 1st week of Feb and today is April 23rd.
I am hopeful that order will be delivered in the first week of May.
Customer service did not do any proactive calls as I have to be the one chasing my order.
One of the customer service managers told me “we do not live in a perfect world and delays can happen”. Delays can happen but 3 months delay should not be called just delays in an imperfect world... I wish I was able to talk to someone that could have done more than what they have offered to minimize the issue...
I will get back with more updates when I get the order finally delivered... 5/6/19 UPDATE: my seats got delivered on May 1st. I am a feeling a little better now. Customer service got in contact with me after this review, with a more reasonable approach to help me with the issue. Delivery was great. Seats came packed nicely. Very easy to put together and I love how it looks in our theater room. I am improving this review from a 1 star to a 3 star.<//Review>< GmapID>

I have sat on and reviewed numerous seating manufactures.  I have exhausted Google and other search engines. My bottom has been on more cowhide than I care to admit.  Then.....a AMAZING man named Alex Osorio at 4seating in La Habra, Ca introduced himself, made me feel welcome into what I can describe as Theater Seating HEAVEN.  He took the time to qualify me on what I wanted in a chair.  He didn't try to under or over sell me.  After narrowing my search to (3) chairs, the Seatcraft Mantra won our hearts.  We special ordered a custom Bordeaux(wine) color.  12 weeks later with a "white glove" delivery, by (2) AMAZING young men.....Pure JOY and EXCITEMENT has overcome us.  These chairs are the most comfortable chairs EVER.  They are the creme de la creme...featuring power recline, lumbar, head rests and SOUND SHAKER!!! Thank you!!! for Seating for employing Alex Osorio, he is MAGNIFICENT at what he does and an asset to the company.

HAPPY CUSTOMERS...

<Review>Both Angela and Joseph were extremely helpful! I ordered two Cuddle Seats with Jospeh and had an random issue with one of the cushions. Joseph was off the day I called in, so Angela stepped in to help. Angela went above and beyond to help me get the issue corrected. She was kind, gave great service and had prompt follow-up. Overall, I am so pleased with my Cuddle Seats and I absolutely would buy more seating from this company!</Review>< GmapID>

Josep Yabarra recommended this brand & style because after he inquired about my height & weight. Theses chairs are so comfortable because of the taller backrest & longer recline. In addition, the leather is beautiful and blends in nicely with the decor of my home theatre. His recommendation to purchase the "White Glove" service was well worth the cost. The delivery company was right on time and very professional & respectful of my home and the issues with Covet-19 protocals.

<review>I contacted the sales team a few times about a replacement part for a theatre seat (Grenada 7000), i purchased about 5 years back and they were unable to help. Fortunately, I only live about an hour away from the corporate office so I decided to take the trip and speak to someone directly. I was greeted well by the staff and connected with Dario for my need. After explaining my situation, he stated that they had never done what I was asking but would try to help in any way he could. He was an expert on the product I purchased and knew exactly would I needed but wasn’t sure if I would be able to get the items I needed. He connected me with Richard after explaining to him the details of what I needed. Since this was not an ordinary request, Richard needed to research and price the items. After about 2 weeks, Richard had found all the information and pricing for the items I needed. As it turns out, there was a spare part at the facility that matched the part I needed. The company was kind enough to offer me the spare part and connection pieces free of charge and only charged me for the shipping. Overall, a buying experience far exceeding what I could have expected. I would like to personally thank Dario an Richard for there assistance and excellent customer service.

<review>Horrible customer service, very rude!

Delivered damaged theater chairs, I refused the delivery.

Speaking with customer service rep (Angela) was told that “even if I send you another order, there is no guarantee they will not be damaged”. Really ? that is how you handle a customers almost $4,000 purchase and dismiss it as OH WELL!  Totally unsatisfactory customer service!

Definitely not happy! Initially spoke with Andrew to get some questions answered when I wanted to move forward I emailed him back, he did not reply because he said he was off for several days. When I tried to check out myself through their website the $200 discount for Memorial Day was being dropped down to $100 at checkout SO MAKE SURE YOU PAY ATTENTION! I ended up buying somewhere else because there was a time crunch and being stuck in the house more due to covid 19. My other order did not go through because they ran out of my item. I emailed Andrew back again that I wanted to move fast and in case they work on commission to call me ASAP- Again no reply. And again self check out was not honoring $200 discount for Father’s Day sale. I decided to call and spoke to Zach The only good experience I’ve had in this whole thing. Ended up paying more and getting a better real leather seat sofa. Zach showed me the value in the upgrade but only set back was that the Republic from Seatcraft was not one of their ships in 24 hr items. Zach told me I should have sofa in my home no later than 4 weeks. And I paid the extra $200 for White Glove delivery BIG MISTAKE! 1st sales rep Andrew called me a week later- and said to just check out myself online and he would tag himself for the credit (felt like he wanted to do as little as possible-he had been out sick understandable during these times, but definitely did not deserve any commissions if any over Zach. Had I spoken to Zach from the beginning I would have had my couches a long time Ago. Live in NJ and they used JB HUNT for their white glove -when scheduling apt for white glove delivery which was an extra 2 week process. I let them know I had 2 items that I wanted to be delivered together. Rep said they already had all my items. I double Checked with them again before delivery date they again said yes. Driver showed up passed delivery window with only 1 recliner Which took 2 seconds to connect 2 wires together and that was it -that simply. And hand me confused with someone else that needed to return an item????? Currently theirs confusion back and forth with 4seating as to where my sofa is located. I still do not have my sofa after already throwing away our old couch and family of 4 having no place to sit/eat. Which I would not have done if they didn’t confirm twice that I would get all my items- JB Hunt said it must be on another truck- then -apparently they didn’t even have it at all to begin with -And by the time they get it- it will be another 2 weeks to schedule delivery. 4seating customer service said they did not have any control of JB Hunt& washed their hands-offered no solution other then just wait for JB to call and schedule. Even though it is the company they chose to do business with. If I had not paid the extra $200 for white glove my sofa would probably already be here. Customer service rep said it was too late to cancel it and get money my back and would only delay it further. So if you are shopping online with no discount, don’t mind waiting all the time it takes for your item to get to you then sure. Don’t count on all your items Being there at delivery so don’t be hasty throwing anything out until you have everything finally at your home. The only Seatcraft Delta chair I have received so far is beautiful, so I would recommend buying them from another company and don’t bother with white glove unless you don’t mind extra delays. It’s really not that complicated to put together. There’s just too many cooks in the kitchen- from Seatcraft shipping items to 4seating to them mailing it to delivery company from them sending it to another company for white glove installation. So many ways it could go wrong. Seatcraft would sell a lot more but removing all the middle men. But lesson learned so -I would not recommend or will be purchasing form 4seating in the future. Only thing I have control over is sharing my experience through online platforms to save the next person the trouble.<//review>

I did some research on theater room seating, and everything was pointing to 4seating.com. I always order online for sites like these, but I decided to call, and I’m glad I did. Jesse picked up the phone and helped us out so much, and steered us in the right direction and also got us a GREAT deal. The theater seating came in, and it is soooo comfy. I was worried about ordering seating online, but it really great build quality and comfort.

<Name>lionel gottschalk</Name><Review>What a great experience. As good customer service as I can remember.
My wife and I flew out from Denver - wanting to try out the seats before making such a large purchase. We were given one on one attention for several hours by extremely knowledgeable salesmen. After showing us the chairs we came in to look at and listening to the features we were most interested in, they pointed us to several more chairs on the floor, and then took us to see a few more in the back that they thought we might like even more. Sure enough, our two favorites were the chairs they showed us in the back.
To top it all off we were able to meet with one of their lead designers who, at no cost, is helping us design the layout for not only the chairs but our entire theatre room based on the theatre room specs.
We were very impressed with our visit and thought it was well worth the flight out there.
Five stars only because we can't give ten.</Review>< rate>

Needed a replacement part for one of my theater chairs that I purchased 5 years ago.  They knew the model, part and recommended the solution.  Whole call took less than 5 minutes.</review>

After-sales support is what distinguishes a company that truly care about their customers from others.

I contacted 4Seating for support with a replacement part and Richard promptly and courteously attended to my call. He was quick to understand the problem and provide a solution.

This approach towards customer satisfaction, will definitely bring back repeat customers and also I feel comfortable referring this company to my friends and relatives.<//text>

I bought the 4 row seating from 4seating. Nice chairs and nice leather. Very comfortable and fit my upstairs game room really well.

We had an issue with one of the seats being damaged on delivery(part of the frame was bent and twisted). I promptly contacted them and sent them pics. They were quick in addressing the issue and promptly sent me out a replacement chair.

Many thanks. I am enjoying my set of chairs!<//review>

<Text>We were looking to upgrade the seating in our home theater, after doing a quick internet search 4seating came up with tons of good reviews. We decided to do our due diligence and called them up. Alex answered and was very knowledgable on the various product lines. He asked some basic questions and steered us to a line different from the one we had identified, seeing as we actually had the space. We settled on the seatcraft sienna line paid for our order and Alex confirmed they would ship within 24 hours. 48 hours later the shipper called to confirm delivery. The seating came and was as advertised, easy to assemble and fit perfectly. We couldn't be more satisfied,  the kids have been in the theater every night since we set things up. You can't go wrong with 4seating.com< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
I had excellent customer service from John Jasso of 4Seating. We had a power supply for our power seating go bad, and John went above and beyond to get me a new power supply part to get our power seating up and running again. I would definitely buy from 4Seating again!!!! Thanks John<//Review>

We were looking for a theater seating unit to replace the one in our RV, which  was not comfortable or designed well.  4seating had a large selection in the showroom, and John or salesman was knowledgeable and friendly.  We settled on a 3 seat power reclining couch with power headrests.  We paid about half what we paid for the one that came in the RV.  I can highly recommend this company for your seating needs.</text>

<username>Robert</username><review>Ordered this on Monday 4/20 after speaking with Zachary from Seatcraft. Wife and I originally had our sights set on the Europa, but Zachary suggested the Anthem as its made of top grain leather where as the Europa is made of gel leather. Same features on both and not much difference in price for a much better material. It was great advice which we followed.

I placed the order and Zachary told me the item will ship on 4/21 to a local mover near me and they would contact me in a day or two after they received it to schedule delivery.  I opted not to do the white glove service as I’m handy with assembling furniture, and Zachary said that although the couch was heavy, the backrests were not attached and could be carried individually, two people should be able to manage carrying the base. Based on that guidance, I went with curbside drop. If I can offer advice: For the love of God and all that is holy, do NOT do curbside delivery. The couch is incredibly heavy. If your situation requires carrying the couch up or down stairs, pay the 199 bucks and have them do the heavy work. I wound up hiring local movers last minute to come and move it. Also, the love seat comes wrapped in lots of cardboard and is placed on a large wooden pallet.  The driver did not take the pallet, so I had the fun of breaking down the pallet into a whole bunch of pieces to ensure it fit inside the trash bins (we have strict trash/recycling requirements here).  Had I done the white glove service I would not have had to mess with all of that.  So again - buy the white glove service, totally worth it.

About the delivery schedule itself, remember I said Zachary told me to expect a call from the delivery company? That never happened. Dude just arrived on Wednesday 4/22 and I was totally unprepared. It made for a long and inconvenient afternoon sitting outside guarding my new couch chillin on the sidewalk while waiting for last minute hired movers to arrive. So not very happy about the delivery experience.

Couch itself: Pretty comfortable and enjoy it a lot. But some annoying small defects. 1. Seam on back of couch has a two inch defect where the threads are frayed/missing. 2. The leather is sagging where it should sit flush and tight under the center power console (on fold out middle table). 3. The post that secures the armrest table into the armrest kept popping out, making the table unusable.

Warranty support and customer service is great.  They answered the phone on the first call and kept in close communication with my by e-mail.  For issue 1, they are sending me a new seat back (will take  few weeks but I'm ok with that).  For issues 2 and 3, they provided me guidance by e-mail on how to fix myself.  Very simple and quick fixes.  If you can use a screw driver, you can fix these issues in under 5 minutes.

Also, if buying made in the USA is important to you, then you may be unhappy.  Although Seatcraft appears to be a U.S. owned and operated company, it appears my recliner couch was made in Vietnam (as per the manufacturer label affixed to the bottom of my couch).  Not a show stopper for me.

Overall, its a very good product, quite comfortable and the accessories are very nice.  Some shoddy workmanship on the finishing touches are frustrating, but their warranty support and quick response has been very good. The delivery service could have been better, but I realize they outsource that part. Had the delivery experience been better, I would have rated at 5 stars.  Overall, this is a great company to do business with, and I would buy furniture from them again.< /review></record>

Excellent product and service.  Have had the Argonaut theatre seating for two years and love the quality and how well it has held up.  Had a minor self inflicted accident that damaged the recliner switch and 4seating helped address the issue immediately.  Will not hesitate to purchase new product from them in the future.<//review>

Bought the Seatcraft Sigma which I love. Wireless charger started messing up, flashing blue and green. 5 emails later, over a course of 24hrs (started it late one night). I have a replacement piece coming in by tomorrow night. Great product, great service.</Review>

<Text>YOU WANT TO READ THIS REVIEW!
I just had such an awesome experience with these guys, and I wanted to share so you know what type of business owners are behind this business.
I have been shopping for a recliner for months because I'm a quadriplegic and have chronic pain, and it's more complicated to find the perfect chair. The owner and his brother who works with them both helped us the moment we got there and ended up encouraging us to feel free to stay and keep looking as long as we want. They ended up happily staying for over an hour and a half late to make sure we could transfer and sit on every chair that we wanted. They were super friendly, patient, and we did not feel pressured at all to hurry or to make a purchase. We found the perfect recliner couch, and they gave us a great deal on it, and he even threw in white glove delivery because obviously I can't help move the couch. The couch we bought was one that they manufacture, and the quality plus all of the features have my friends blown away.
Thank you guys so much for all the help and we are loving the couch!<//Text>< pics>

Angela, thank you very much for your expert handling of my furniture exchange. From the moment I contacted your company with an issue, you owned the process and assured me that everything would be taken care of... and it was. Thanks for your assistance, guidance, and happy attitude throughout the interaction. You are terrific, and I would rate you higher than 5-stars, if I could!< /review>

I was having trouble tracking my order. I called John and he immediately found the issue. Gave me the number for the carrier and the carrier’s order number, which was different than 4seating’s order and tracking number. I called the carrier and expect my delivery in a couple of days!  Very pleased with all the customer service we have received with 4seating. John was friendly and helpful. Thanks!< /Text>

<Review>We were a little nervous ordering our theater seating without seeing it first, just trusting others reviews.  We received our furniture exactly when they said that we would, and we couldn't be happier with the quality of the seating and the customer service that we received!  We had a couple of chairs that were damaged in the shipping and worked with John Jasso to get them replaced.  John responded immediately to our email and offered to get them replaced for us quickly!  We really appreciate the friendly customer service that we've received and would recommend this company to anyone who is considering purchasing theater seating.  We couldn't be happier with the furniture that we have received, and the excellent customer service we've received from John is much appreciated!!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>We were going to buy some home theater seats and after looking online saw that this company had a showroom in La Habra Ca. After telling the sales person what we were looking for he showed us several options. We had a few questions and he was very knowledgeable about lumbar support,warranties,seat construction and shipping times . We even changed our minds a couple times and he was very patient.
This was a great shopping experience and we will definitely recommend this company to all of our friends and family.</review><Rating>5<//Rating>< username>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>This experience was absolutely abysmal. I ordered a 5 piece home theater set on March 22,  2019. The item arrived on 4/5/2019 incomplete and damaged, 2 pieces out of 5 showed and 1 out of those 2 were damaged.

The customer service reps were not helpful at all in finding out where the remaining 3 items of my order went! It was not until 4/18/2019 when they finally contacted me to send me a new 5 piece set, not in the color I originally ordered. I like to think I’m a reasonable consumer so I agreed to the color change, but requested that the item be delivered no more than 12 days from the date I agreed to accept the offer because I will be out of the country for two weeks. Considering the grief the company and its representatives put me through, I did not think that was too much to ask. Of course, they could not comply.

When all is said and done it will have taken nearly two months from when I ordered the items to when I actually receive them, with no discounted or credit from the company.

To sum up, DO NOT ORDER from this company. Absolutely terrible customer service, terrible communication, terrible delivery time. Save yourself the grief.< /text>< user>

Clarissa and John have been tremendously helpful, in not only my decision making process but the type of fabric, colors, options and even had the color swatch panel out to me right away.

They have been respectful, responsive, and courteous through the entire process.

I received my custom, hand-stitched, truck seats and these have exceeded my expectations! I could not be happier with the seats, customer service and opportunity to work with such a wonderful team.

I will definitely be coming back to Clarissa and John for my next row of seats and ANY future projects!< /review>

<Review>My order had an error, the person I talked to could not resolve the issue. But the sales associate that I originally worked with called me back and resolved it.  Delivery was on time an within a week of ordering and very professional.  Only issue was the bracket to hold the love seat portion together was not included in the shipment and had to be reordered.<//Review>< Pics>

We purchased three Seatcraft Diamante chairs for my son's room to create a mini-theater. The chairs are absolutely beautiful and top quality leather, just stunning! We paid extra for setup since these were going on the 2nd floor - the delivery and setup service was top-notch. Everyone we talked to at 4seating was professional and polite. They KNOW their product! I highly recommend this company and will definitely purchase from them again. It has been a wonderful experience from start to finish.</Text>

<Review>I purchased a seating set a couple years ago and was having issues with one of the headrests. I called customer support and spoke with John Jasso. He was very friendly and helpful with assisting me in troubleshooting my problem. It was an easy fix and John walked me through what I needed to do. He stayed on the phone with me while I fixed the problem. Very helpful!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The purchase process was seamless. Best prices on the internet and even locally. Customer service was extremely friendly and helpful. White Glove service was top notch and the whole delivery and setup process took less than thirty minutes. Buy with confidence from this vendor.</text>

<Review>Although I have not yet received my chairs as of yet (eta Mid-January), so far, so good! The website is easy to use, and when I went down to the showroom to see the chairs for themselves,  I felt very taken care of. John and his crew were very attentive and knowledgeable. They took their time and I didn't feel rushed. Well done!< /Review><Name>Jordan Rockwell< /Name>< GmapID>

Initially there were some issues with our order that required follow up. When I called up for help, Angela, Zack, and Anna worked to figure out the problem and helped solve it to our satisfaction. We appreciated their diligence in making things right. Now we have beautiful seats in our theater room and we really like them!< /review>

I had been looking online and 4Seating always had the best selection and pricing. I was hesitant to buy theater seats online without trying them out, even though I think 4Seating could have guided me well on the phone. I happened to be nearby visiting family and went to the showroom. John J was the salesman and did a really great job giving me information about the seats. He is very knowledgeable, professional, courteous. A real pleasure to work with. Priced out what I wanted in a timely manner. I bought the theater seats while I was there. They even have a quick delivery date. Everyone was very friendly there. The showroom has a good selection. I would highly recommend both 4Seating and John J!<//Text>

<Text>Ordered 6 seats, but unfortunately one came with some technical issues. Upon making 4seating aware of the problem, they immediately offered to send a new replacement at no cost while permitting me to keep the defective chair for replacement parts. The seats exceeded my expectations and were very comfortable. I especially liked the power recline and headrest features. Very solid and excellent quality. Would definitely recommend and the price is great for the quality received.</Text>< gmap_id>

3 Chairs came with small leather tear and it has been over 4 months and they yet have to it exchanged. I paid around $4500 and specially wanted higher quality chairs. They said that chairs is discontinued and they can only offer $300 as compensation but I do not want compensation. I want what I paid for or refund my money and take the chairs back.</review>

<Review>This is the best furniture buying experience we had!! period!!
We were looking at many furniture store (Both online and instore) for our new home. Most them ignored and behave like used car sales people, after the sale on issues/questions. But with 4seating when we had questions about the theater seating the customer service personnel patiently answered all our questions. When the furniture arrived, we decided to change the configuration. Again the customer service made suggestions and helped us ordering the additional parts and explained how to install. They were very responsive in emails too!!

And coming to the quality of the furniture. It is great, that too for this price!! Definitely recommend them.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Out of all the online sites, they were cheaper and often had discounts available.   I did all my ordering online.   Customer service was fantastic as I had a couple of accessory items that were either missing or broken-resolved the issue expeditiously and sent out replacements.  I am really glad I chose them as it could be a bit of a crapshoot.  I spent >5k for more home theater room that seats 11.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dd2abf22c6692b:0x3701429ce3591218</gmap_id>< Time>

John was more than patient while helping me to figure out how to install the armrests on our new captain chairs. It would have been helpful if the shipment included instructions saying to install the armrests BEFORE mounting the seats. It was very difficult afterwards. If not for John, I probably would have removed the seats to mount the armrests. He is to commended for his attention to duty.<//Text>

I had the unfortunate situation of one seat arriving damaged (bent metal footing - the quality of the metal made it such that I couldn't bend it back to normal shape) during shipment, but all it took was one call to Customer Service and John Jasso had a new one shipped within 2 days.

I love the recliner. There were a couple of issues with the  recliner. The bracket at the bottom of the recliner was loose and held by one screw. One of the screw broke off and the threaded section was in the hole. Good thing the bracket had another hole that I was able to use to put in a new screw to attach the bracket. The biggest issue I had was the electrical wiring was inside the center console. Without having fear of breaking something on the center console I didn't know how to get access to the wires. I started to feel inside the seam of the backrest and felt something between the backrest and the top of the console. I pulled on it and the top of the console lifted up. Behold there were the wires. There was a strap that bedded inside the console. It would have been nice to either have the strap expose outside the console and or put a tag on the recliner with instruction. Otherwise the recliner is comfortable, sturdy, and looks great.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dd2abf22c6692b:0x3701429ce3591218< /gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

This company is wonderful! I searched for months for the best seats to put into our newly constructed theater room. I found 4Seating and Patricia especially incredibly helpful during the order process. I had quite a large number of questions that were answered fast and beyond expectations. My 6 seats arrived securely packaged and in great shape. Unfortunately, two backrests got damaged during shipment. I called, spoke to Richard, and was quickly provided with the replacements. Thank you for this great experience. We will certainly recommend to all our friends.<//review>

<text>We ordered a set of chairs and upon delivery, noticed one of the legs was damaged.  After a quick phone call, Richard sent us a followup email with instructions on how to report the damage.  Within 30 minutes of sending all the information requested, he had reviewed the information and ordered the replacement.

<Review>It's not easy picking out a couch, and with the selection that 4Seating has, there is a good choice for everyone. After visiting 4Seating and their helpful sales staff, I picked out a great recliner with all the bells and whistles, but when it came in there were some issues with the stitching in the back.
Angela in Customer Service handled my return, and it went very smoothly, and they continued to work with me until I was 100% satisfied. I was informed throughout the replacement process, and they went above and beyond to make sure my recliner was perfect.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1549352995365, 'text': 'We really appreciate your feedback I would like to request you if you can publish your product photos with review ! it can really help us for reference. for any further help and assistance please let us know always happy to serve you :)'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Everyone at 4seating has been great to deal with - I came in to check out the chairs and spent a couple of hours there, then left - called back 3 weeks later to order, and they were all very gracious and helpful. Never rushed or pressured. Looking forward to quick delivery and set up this week. Special thanks to John.< /Review>< Pictures>

My room has the feel of an actual movie Cinema! The the products are upscale and customizable to any home theater. The staff and help of the customer service representatives insure that you get exactly what you're looking for with 3D renderings. I will certainly refer them to anybody looking to create unique room in their home.<//review>

I received excellent service from John Jasso.  He was great in answering my questions, timely in his response, and had excellent follow-up.  He was also very well informed about the products and showed flexibility and attention to detail in his discussions with me.  He has also promised to follow up in future with me when the seats I ordered are shipped.< /text>

I found this place online and found the seating I wanted. Ordering was easy and I anticipated an estimated delivery time that was at least 2 months. It arrived on time and I set them up myself. My wife and I love them. I would surely buy from them again. My guests really like them as well.< /Review>

<Review>Had such a great experience dealing with this company from start to finish. Zack Falcon gave me such great advice  on choosing the most suitable motion furniture for a very difficult room layout. The sofas we ordered are beautiful. Great quality leather with nice features.  Upon delivery we noticed that there were a couple of defective or missing parts. I called customer service and spoke with two different people, John Jasso and Angela Allen. Both took fantastic care of us. Replacement parts were sent out immediately.

Great product, great customer service. I would highly recommend this company.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Awesome customer service. The company’s representative Richard Valdez answered my questions accurately, and promptly. The theater sofa I’ve  got is bar-none the most comfortable, versatile, and best made piece of furniture I’ve ever owned. My only problem is staying awake through a whole movie! I guess that’s just a problem I’ll have to deal with. Thanks Richard!

ordered a three piece recliner couch set from Amazon, I recieved it damaged and contacted Angela Allen
concerning my issues .
I had little faith that the unit would be replaced and I was stuck with a repaired unit at best.
well not the outcome at all ,after a few emails to Angela the decision was to replace my couch immediately and delivery was less then two weeks .
five star treatment from Angela Allen and 4 seating policies.
highly recommended.< /Text>

Phenomenal customer service, quick shipping, competitive pricing. When we redid our home theater, I was a bit nervous about ordering seats online, especially since they were one of the most expensive pieces of the project.  I decided on 4Seating because they had the best price on the seats we wanted.  I was surprised to see just how good their shipping process was, and every time I had questions, my calls were answered very by Americans who spoke fluent English.  Although we will likely never need theater seats again; if we did, I wouldn't even consider another company.< /text>

Service with 4 Seating has been great.  I’m not as happy with the delivery company only showing 1 day for my delivery and it’s 2 weeks out.  I paid for white glove delivery and I’m not feeling it as of yet.  We will see how it goes on delivery day and I will give them the benefit of the doubt for now.</review>

Showroom hard to find but highly recommend checking out largest selection seen anywhere we could find.  We bought three leather chairs w/ electrical /power package.  Sweet!  Their service knowledge was great and we're happy with our purchase and delivery/set-up.  If you can't find what you want/need here -- it probably doesn't exist.<//review>

We could not be happier with the RV furniture and our experience with 4seating! The furniture came exactly as we ordered! In fact, they are even more beautiful than we imagined! My husband installed all of the furniture, himself! Even after never installing RV furniture before, he did it within a few hours! The shipping was on time! The customer service staff was so helpful and a pleasure to work with! Don’t let the bad reviews deter you from ordering from this company, because they are the BEST! I’m so glad that we ignored the bad reviews, and took a chance! Worth every penny!</text>

<Review>I have purchased the Seatcraft Helios row of 3 and I'm quite pleased with quality of the leather and power recliners. I'm definitely glad I went for the powered headrests. They definitely help when fully reclined and watching a movie, otherwise you'd be staring at the ceiling. There was an issue with receiving a dark brown section instead of black. However, Richard Valdez took care of the issue. If you need customer service, then the staff is responsive and will take care of the issue promptly. I'm happy with my purchase from 4seating and would definitely recommend them again.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I ordered 8 leather reclining theater seats. They arrived on time and the white glove delivery was outstanding! The chairs are beautiful and obviously well made. The leather feels very durable, yet comfortable, and the smell of new leather fills the room!
I did have trouble with one of the recliner motors, however, I called John Jasso at customer service and he had a new motor in the mail within a day and is arranging for a local technician to come to the house and make the repair.Overall, OUTSTANDING products, delivery, and service. I would definitely buy from 4Seating again!< /Text>< rate>

A wooden support board broke on one chair. I sent 4Seating a picture and they have ordered me a replacement chair at no charge.

Great place to shop for Theater seats and recliners! John Jasso was a great customer rep who helped me from beginning to end. He was very nice and courteous. At no point did he try to pressure me into buying or anything like that. He answered all questions that he could and went the extra mile where he can in order to make me happy with the purchase. The delivery process was very smooth as well. They came and installed everything very professionally and was very respectful of my house. Overall I was really happy with my purchase and would love to come back if I ever needed any more chairs.<//text>

Our chairs arrived and they are wonderful, very comfortable. We had a little issue with our order as we received one chair that was not what we ordered. I emailed John J at 4seating and our issue was resolved quickly and to my satisfaction. Thank you, John J.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
We purchased stadium seating from this company four years agio. The upgraded bonded leather has disintegrated !!!  We were assured by Anna, our sales person, this material would wear well.  We would not have spent $3,000 on furniture that would only last for two to four years as we are being told presently. Why would a company sell furniture with such poor lasting fabric???  We also invested in the five year extended warranty. Why would we purchase this if we were told the furniture would only last 2-4 years???  Warning !!! Do not use bonded leather. We wish some eiuld have given us correct information regarding bonded leather. Anna says she told us but I guarantee we would not invest $3,000 for furniture that was disposable in two years time. Also, the furniture was only used by my husband and I maybe once every two weeks since it was in our basement. I am also disappointed the company will not stand behind their furniture.

I love it San Diego and need seats for our home theater. My wife and I took a drive up to Anaheim to check out their show room and were not disappointed. They had a great selection of seats, and were extremely curtious. The seats they had on display are all hooked up, so you can try out all of them.

The person there wasn't pushing for us to buy seats, he just answered all of our questions. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for high quality theater seats.</text>

Very pleased with the experience. John in customer service was professional and provided prompt and accurate responses to my questions about my order.

We received our RV captains chairs three days earlier than expected. That was a nice surprise especially since they are on the west coast and we are on the east coast. They look beautiful and will be installed today!</text>

<review>After looking at several other companies for home Theater seats 4seating was the very best hands down that dealt I with Alex and John was very Professional and very easy to work with. These guy's made the process very easy and explained the product in detail to me also I got follow up calls and return call's when I had a question. I am very pleased with the service and the product and would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for home theater seating.
Thank you Alex and John for all your help.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I love a company that stands behind their products when something goes wrong. I purchased six leather theater chairs about eight months ago. A wooden support board broke on one chair. I sent 4Seating a picture and they have ordered me a replacement chair at no charge. Unlike many other companies I have dealt with, 4Seating was responsive and hassle-free.< /Review>< pics>

He's been great to work with.  The 4 seats we bought work well for our situation.  I gave 4 stars because 1) one of the recliners was built crooked (John is quickly repacking it, been very helpful), 2) one recliner has a very minor quality issue with the sewing, 3) their show room can be a bit tricky to find / park / get to (my wife uses a walker, but John made sure we had a path), and 4) they have different names for their company / website, which can be a bit confusing.

But after looking at all the usual retail stores for months, finding this place was a real find.  I HIGHLY recommend checking out their showroom, if in SoCal.  John ordered us exactly what we needed.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I couldn't be happier!  My girlfriend and I came down to the La Habra showroom last month. They definitely have lots to choose from... I'd say at least 50 different designs in a wide array of colors. The employees were super nice, especially our sales rep Dario who patiently went over their product line and color options with us. We knew we had the space for home theater seats and we had some basic ideas on what to choose. Dario diligently helped us narrow it down to exactly what we needed. Delivery happened about a week later. They brought the furniture to my home theater room and set it all up.  These seats are amazing.  The arm rests are so beefy compared to the ones on those generic home theater chairs out there.  I highly recommend this place!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Darian, was very knowledgeable and professional.  He took time to understand our needs and recommended the best option for our home theater need.

Same exact model by Seacraft was about $600 more on amazon.  So, pricing is competitive and service from Darian is excellent.  What more can anyone ask for?</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Just purchased 2 new captain chairs for our RV. We had the opportunity to see the production warehouse and how the seats were made. All the materials and products are high quality. It was nice to see manufacturing site where products are made in the USA. We had issue with a defective seat which was quickly remediated and the company sent us a replacement. Shipping was fast too! Highly recommend their product and their great customer service!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dd2abf22c6692b:0x3701429ce3591218< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Excellent showroom service. Sales representative, John Jasso handled all of our questions expertly and the selection on the floor was just right. Very accommodating and no hard sell. Anyone looking for home theater seating will miss out if they don't shop here, FIRST! We found just what we wanted - PERFECT :-)</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This showroom in La Habra, CA is worth visiting for reclining sofas and various configurations of theatre and media seating. Our experience with Dario was stellar and made us feel valued as a customer. He listened to our needs in reclining sofa seating and spent quite a bit of time finding just the right one with all the features we wanted at a fair and reasonable price. Dario made this a very pleasant experience, especially when compared to the chain furniture stores and sales people who just don't listen. While most of their business is online, this showroom is worth a visit to check out the quality of the product and get a feel when sitting on it. Again, Dario was superb in his customer service.</Review>< pictures>

<pics>None</pics><Text>A cupholder light went out which controlled the light or both the cupholder and LED bar underneath my Seatcraft movie theater seating. Of course. I hadn't used the lights in...well over a year. I try to turn it on: nothing. The seats are three years old. This made me sad. We rarely used it, but, of course, didn't work. I contacted the customer care team from Seatcraft because I was unable to find the discontinued part I needed to light up my world (okay...light up my chair). Richard responded the same day and said he would send me a new one after ensuring the part was in from the parts manager. We exchanged a couple emails (he wanted to make sure he sent me the right part). The next day I contacted him to make sure they were able to locate it. He sent me an order summary. Hopefully the part goes out tomorrow (fingers crossed, which does absolutely nothing). 5 stars for excellent customer service. Very pleased with the speed of getting ahold of someone and finding resolution. I will definitely be a returning customer to 4seating.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate><Time>1569392169734</Time><Gmap_id>0x80dd2abf22c6692b:0x3701429ce3591218</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Recently bought a “SoundRight 27x40 Poster Frame - Illuminated Backlit - LED Light Box Display - For Home Theater Movie Posters - Easy Front Snap Open Clips - Wall Mounting - Black.” Very happy with the way it looks hanging on my wall. The LED light makes the poster come to life, and adds a “theater” feel to my home home theater. Very satisfied with there customer service also.</Text>< pics>

I bought my chairs about a month ago and received 2 weeks ago.  They are awesome!!!  The service received when they had a small glitch is incredible.  John Jasso was both professional and ensured that I was completely satisfied.  Cudos to 4seating to having a top notch customer focused staff!
Thank you!!!</Review>

Shipping issues that didn't work out with YRC shipping company led to an apology and some store credit to try to make it right.

I will shop there again, but will only order if they can use a different shipping company.

The seats are fantastic and the quality is amazing.  If it was not for the shipping problem it would be a 5 star review.  But because the shipper that they use is totally incompetent and pathetic I can only give them a 4 star review.</text>

We traveled from Michigan and were staying in LA just to get home theater seats. Customer service was excellent. They were patient while we tried all the seats and ultimately we found what we wanted at a great value. If your thinking of driving or traveling to this store it will pay off in having nice people help you get the best seating for your home!!<//text>

< review>
So my chairs are pretty nice but they're configured as a loveseat and there's a big gap between the chairs - locked that way with a connector.  I tried to work with customer service to get it fixed and they told me to buy an alternate connector from Amazon and fix it myself.  This was after paying extra for "white glove" delivery service.  I recommend you try someone else for your chairs because they are "not into details".< /review>

Carla was great.  Richard stepped in and helped me when Francisco left made hanging and went to lunch.  Problem resolved.  Anthem products need to come with a manual on how to connect electrical since important connection is hidden under the motor.< /text>

<Text>We purchased 4 Helios seats from Anna at 4Seating.  We compared the Seatcraft brands to comparable seats from Palliser and other brands.  It is quite difficult choosing furniture online with no local showroom to test and evaluate the products.  Anna made the process painless, with informative advice and a high level of product knowledge.  When the seats arrived we did have some minor issues, Angela at 4Seating helped rectify the issues with professionalism and diligence, resulting in an overall excellent experience.  The seats are certainly higher end and we look forward to years of use.  We would certainly order from 4seating again.   I have faith that the seats will last but time will tell.<//Text><resp>None< /resp><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Date>1565895779921<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I've never bought a piece of furniture online before. It seems crazy to buy a couch without sitting in it. However, we had a specific need for a couch that swiveled on its base and was big enough for two people. The cuddle couch by 4seating exactly matched our specifications, so we took the risk.

Anna Hernandez dealt with our order and she was really great. She sent us cloth samples to choose from. We chose our colors and material and called her back to place the order. She had a direct line, so it was easy to do. We received an email confirmation of our order.

It took several weeks to manufacture the couch and ottoman, but we were in no hurry. Since we live in a high rise condo, deliveries have to be scheduled and elevators padded in preparation, so we ordered the white glove delivery service. Before the promised date, we received an email stating the couch was at the delivery agent and we should call to schedule. It was easy to do. My wife talked to a person and explained the restrictions. The delivery company was very accommodating. On the day of delivery, I was unavailable, but my wife accepted delivery. She said it went smoothly and the delivery guys were helpful.

Ok, nothing is perfect. 4Seating does business online and like all of us, rely on partners. Things occasionally go wrong and what separates great companies from ones you regret doing business with is how they deal with problems. When I got home I saw the couch. It looked great, but I immediately noticed a large scrape that my wife had totally missed. I have no idea if it was done in manufacture, storage, or delivery, but there it was and my wife had signed the delivery notice saying everything was in order. I immediately called and emailed Anna and left a message, but then I looked at the couch thinking, "This just doesn't seem right. Im not sure I'd have ordered this color, though I must say it goes well with the cherry floors and other furniture." I looked at the original order and yes, the color was wrong.

Next morning, I received a call back and an email from Anna saying she'd passed my information and photos to John Jasso in customer service. Part of me was thinking, "Oh no, here we go." But, almost immediately my phone rang and it was John. The only question he asked was whether the box was damaged. I told him I wasn't there, but my wife said the box was gone when they brought it through the door of our unit. He said he would email a resolution in a few minutes. Within a few minutes he told me they were sending a replacement. The only question he asked was did we want them to make the original choice and replace the couch and ottoman or make just the couch in the delivered color. We went with the delivered color. He explained without asking that it would match the ottoman because the material maker always sent advance notice of a dye batch change. Lastly, he said they were expediting manufacture to two or three weeks and the delivery company would remove the old one.

Right now, I'm relaxing on this luxurious furniture item writing this review and sipping a scotch. The only reason I have not giving the review 5 stars is we have yet to resolve the issue, but when done I'll revise the review to five stars. I don't know where the mix up in color occurred, but guess we were lucky in that what we have is better than what we specified. Anna and John were excellent and I would assume from their attitude that 4seating is an ethical company throughout.

Edited to 5 stars after successfully replaced. Thanks!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Purchased furniture for our Motorhome approximately 7 months ago. We are highly recommending this company for its service from the production department to the sales staff. Dario, Charissa and others make this company a place you want to come back to and purchase more. Guess what that is what we did 😎. We decided we needed a new living room sectional due to the great service and price we went back. Need I say more. Darryl and Bobette.< /Review>

I live in the Bay Area and actually flew to LA for a day to sit in the various home theater seats and talk to their designers before ordering. It was totally worth it and my conversations changed my plan for my theater. There's really no store like it where I live and the sales people and designers were great and super helpful.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Alex was very helpful in helping me decide which chair to purchase.  There was a long waiting period for the chair, however this was explained to me in advance.  I am happy with the chair.  There was some minor issue with one of the cables.  This had nothing to do with 4seating.  It was a manufacturing defect and John Jasso promptly shipped me a replacement cable.<//Review>< pictures>

I have been waiting for 10 months for delivery of a home theater stage which houses the movie screen. John Jasso has baited me to keep waiting, continuing with lies about the theater stage being under construction and delivery within weeks.  As far as the Theater seating goes, actually top notch.<//Text>

Our interactions with this company have not been positive. First off, they sent us the wrong chaise. We called and arranged to have the chaise replaced. When the new chaise arrived, they told us that we had to place the incorrect chaise into the box to ship back to them. This was no small feat as the chaise is quite heavy and maneuvering it into the box was not easy. We called 4seating back to arrange pick up of the incorrect chaise. The operator stated that we do not need to be home for the pick up, that we needed to just leave it in the front. I specifically asked a second time to confirm that we did not need to be present for the pick up. Of course they change their mind later and required a different result.additionally  they were rude and disrespectful Throughout the process.</text>

Great experience, called customer service (Fernando Reyes) was very nice and resolved my problem. I'd ordered rv furniture, upon installing the furniture I discovered a flaw on a chair arm, I sent photos of the flaw and am being sent a replacement. The whole experience with Shop4seating has been very easy and I would recommend them and use them again myself.< /text>

We would like to thank John Jasso  for his outstanding customer service with ensuring we receive the proper size  couch bed topper after receiving the incorrect one originally.  Our order  418727  was not the most smooth  purchase we’ve made.   I am sure if you go back and look at our order that started on 25 September you will realize what we’ve been through to  finally  receive our order.  So having John Jasso there to help us and communicate with us has been wonderful.  We are looking forward to receiving the correct size bed topper. Thank you John< /Text>

<Review>Only buy your seats from 4seating, simply the best. I purchased 7 Seatcraft Grenada movie theater seats. Everything came in perfect condition, I paid extra for white glove service and extra warranty. I had one small issue which was I was missing one cup holder insert. I called and spoke to Fernando Reyes and he was so great and apologetic. Fernando is the epitome of what a customer service person should be. Thank you Fernando!<//Review><username>Brad Scheckner</username>< rating>

I went to their showroom and was greated by John Sasso who was not only very knowledgeable but also friendly and helpful. He also answered any questions I had via e-mail and telephone until I was ready to order my reclining love seat. This experience left me satisfied and I would recommend 4seating to family, friends and anyone else looking for a home theater recliner!< /Review>< Pics>

Joseph Ybarra and Angela was great!   I recently purchased the Moneray Seats and billboard marquees... I got a great deal...

I had a set that was delivered and damaged.  Very slow to fix the problem.  The salesperson was Zach he was good.  I am still waiting on pieces that are on back order.  It’s been 3 months.  My theater room has chairs that are damaged and missing pieces.  It could have been handled better especially since, I have spent over 6k for a damaged set.</Text>

We would like to thank John Jasso  for his outstanding customer service with ensuring we receive the proper size  couch bed topper after receiving the incorrect one originally.  Our order  418727  was not the most smooth  purchase we’ve made.   I am sure if you go back and look at our order that started on 25 September you will realize what we’ve been through to  finally  receive our order.  So having John Jasso there to help us and communicate with us has been wonderful.  We are looking forward to receiving the correct size bed topper. Thank you John</Text>

At the beginning I looked in rv magazine and found your shop in southern Ca. It was perfect to go down  for my wife’s family lives down there.  We picked out dinette set and a sofa for our Rv. When arrived I proceeded to install. I am very happy 5 star quality of your merchandise.   I would diffently recommend your place of business along with staff.  As for current issue I don’t blame you or the dinette itself.  If I didn’t have to remove the draw to secure the seat it would been just fine but after completing the repairs I could not get the drawer back. Bearings all over 😩. Being the main body is welded I call you folks to get same glide for I need same one to put inside glides into old frame. Will let you know when work is completed,  Joe Jasso  gets a five star rating  he was very helpful and pleasant.  Hope what I have mind todo works otherwise it’s going to be a lot of work cutting the old out and putting new in.   Again many thanks 😄</review>

<time>1549779062319</time><rating>1</rating><Review>This is absolutely a horrible place and any positive review has to be fake. I spent two hours having the most horrible experience on the phone with Ana the sales person in La Habra when I first called up to place an order. After her very unprofessional display of having to fight with me on every word,, and my very politely keep trying to move forward on every unanswered question, I was basically doing her job for her to decide which chairs were best for me.  She was not knowledgeable of her products, it was very frustrating trying to talk to her, and she had a very uppity and overall annoying attitude. She also seemed very shady and some of her comments simply weren’t matching up. I finally found a row of chairs to go with and I spent over $3,500, on the spot, sight unseen, and told her I would be regularly buying more in the future for other locations. I rearranged my whole schedule to receive the chairs and then they come completely damaged. They were cut up, scratched, dented, the whole deal. When I called up Ana tells me she’s out to lunch and can’t deal with this now.  Wow! Could it get worse? She then saiid “next time they’ll make sure they inspect the product first”. She didn’t say why they didn’t inspect it this first time. Another line she must be used to slinging at disgruntled customers. The driver said that I should just cut off some of the imperfections on the sofa myself with a scissors. He also added that this happens constantly. When I put light on the damaged part you could see the entire leather was literally 100% scuffed up I won’t get into all the details but I think this is the shadiest and most unprofessional company Ivhave ever seen that basically sells defective merchandise and tries to get you to settle for receiving it that way. And apparently on a regular basis nonetheless. I asked who the owner is and they said he is a man name Oscar and that he not only doesn’t ever show up to work, or take calls, but he could care less and I should just be happy that I’m getting my money back. Such a horrible experience and the worst part is these are very very rude people who clearly could care less about their customers.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1549996328385, 'text': '4Seating has been in business for more than 20 years and is dedicated to building quality furniture and providing excellent customer service. It is unfortunate when a seat has damage or a defect. When this happens, we always do our best to offer a solution to correct the problem, just as we did with the damaged chair that was delivered. When replacing the seat was not an acceptable option, we immediately returned all seats and issued a credit in full on the same day.

<Review>We went to 4seating on Saturday to look for replacement theater seating.  We were met by John Jasso.  We told John what we were looking for and he immediately recommended 4-5 models that met our criteria.

We spent about 30 minutes trying them out.  At that point we had a number of questions for John.   John is extremely knowledgeable about the products and patiently answered all of our questions without once pressuring us to buy.

We did end up purchasing 3 seats on Saturday and it looks like they will be delivered on Friday.

Would not hesitate to recommend John and 4seating for home theater seating. It was a pleasure workkng with him.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1549352234477, 'text': 'We really appreciate your feedback I would like to request you if you can publish your product photos with review ! it can really help us for reference. for any further help and assistance please let us know always happy to serve you :)'}<//response>< GmapID>

4 Seating is an amazing company with amazing products and even better service. Received the Madera theatre seats in perfect condition, they couldn't be more comfortable. When I discovered the Led Reading light wasn't working correctly, I called the company and they shipped one out overnight. John Jasso , Couldn't have had better service! Thanks!</review>

<Text>John Jasso a d his staff helped to make my stair panel a reality.  I spoke about all my concerns and they worked hard to correct it.  I'm 100% Happy with my order and seating is next...😀😀😀

Joseph Ybarra and Angela was great!   I recently purchased the Moneray Seats and billboard marquees... I got a great deal... I was a little disappointed for the delays due to Covid 19, the staff made everything worth the wait and I love my items, especially the value.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1596436346591, 'text': 'Hello Bobbie, thank you for your feedback.'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

One month after receiving our row of 2 with console seat, we noticed a dent in the armrest and realized that something had broken inside it.  2 emails were exchanged between myself and John & Alec and a replacement armrest will be shipped b out tomorrow!  And they're sending a tech to do the replacement!  5* service 4seating!!  Thank you. :)</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>This is absolutely a horrible place and any positive review has to be fake. I spent two hours having the most horrible experience on the phone with Ana the sales person in La Habra when I first called up to place an order. After her very unprofessional display of having to fight with me on every word,, and my very politely keep trying to move forward on every unanswered question, I was basically doing her job for her to decide which chairs were best for me.  She was not knowledgeable of her products, it was very frustrating trying to talk to her, and she had a very uppity and overall annoying attitude. She also seemed very shady and some of her comments simply weren’t matching up. I finally found a row of chairs to go with and I spent over $3,500, on the spot, sight unseen, and told her I would be regularly buying more in the future for other locations. I rearranged my whole schedule to receive the chairs and then they come completely damaged. They were cut up, scratched, dented, the whole deal. When I called up Ana tells me she’s out to lunch and can’t deal with this now.  Wow! Could it get worse? She then saiid “next time they’ll make sure they inspect the product first”. She didn’t say why they didn’t inspect it this first time. Another line she must be used to slinging at disgruntled customers. The driver said that I should just cut off some of the imperfections on the sofa myself with a scissors. He also added that this happens constantly. When I put light on the damaged part you could see the entire leather was literally 100% scuffed up I won’t get into all the details but I think this is the shadiest and most unprofessional company Ivhave ever seen that basically sells defective merchandise and tries to get you to settle for receiving it that way. And apparently on a regular basis nonetheless. I asked who the owner is and they said he is a man name Oscar and that he not only doesn’t ever show up to work, or take calls, but he could care less and I should just be happy that I’m getting my money back. Such a horrible experience and the worst part is these are very very rude people who clearly could care less about their customers.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1549996328385, 'text': '4Seating has been in business for more than 20 years and is dedicated to building quality furniture and providing excellent customer service.

After weeks of searching online, going into showrooms locally of companies that specialize in Home Theater rooms and making a poor purchase at a local furniture store, I finally settled on 4seating. What made my initial experience at 4seating so amazing was the customer service that John Jasso gave. He was able to assist me in the proper selection of seating both my wife and I wanted. John went above and beyond to answer my questions and work through my request. My wife really wanted a Chaise on the end of our Theater Seating area and I wanted electronic headrests along with lumbar support. John was able to build up a custom seating to meet all our needs at a more then reasonable pricing option. I'm giving John Jasso 5 STARS, but I have to give 4seating a 4 star experience, because they should offer some sort of Financing option i.e. Synchrony, which a lot of major stores now partner with.<//review>

When installing some beautiful furniture that I purchased for my motorhome, I had a problem installing one of the captain's chairs arm.
A representative sent me a YouTube instructional video on how to do it.But I  was still unable to install the armrest. I was referred to John Jasso of customer support who after determining that my problem was due to a manufacturing problem, authorized a free replacement seat with free shipping.How about that for standing behind a product!< /review>

Be warned that many of these reviews are fake. This company struggles greatly in providing any kind of service. They are focused on making money and don't care at all about the customer. Watch out for Richard Valdez. He has no desire to help anyone and doesn't care who you are.

I purchased home theater chairs and while the site advertises many features they don't tell you all the parts you need. They will charge you for the chairs and even deliver them without all the parts. Then when they show up they act like it's a shipping or packaging issue. When you call in they tell you that you didn't buy all the right parts and make you go to their website to figure it out. They won't tell you what's missing they just send you a link to their site and make you get and figure it out.

Since the chairs are already delivered you're stuck paying for shipping to return the order and any additional fees they add on our you are forced to go online and buy the missing parts, if you can figure it out.

On top of all this nightmare the accessories are cheap and don't work. You pay $50 for an LED light and it's cheap plastic that is non functional. You're then stuck fighting with the poor customer service department to try and get a replacement. It took me 5-6 different emails to try to make any progress.

As if this wasn't bad enough, once I figured out what to buy I ordered the extra parts. I then received a notice that everything I previously ordered plus the missing parts is being shipped. The invoice only had the missing parts but now it says I have four new chairs coming. I REFUSE to pay for the new chairs and dread the hassle I'll have trying to figure it out. I tried to call in and their support staff told me they don't know what is going on and that I should call in tomorrow and see if someone else answers the phone as maybe they can figure it out. Once again this company doesnt care at all about customers.

While the chairs seem nice, the experience, horrific customer service, poor ordering system, crappy website, and general catastrophic business processes have made this a nightmare experience.

Thank you "4 seating" for ruining my birthday / Father's day present and something I've saved up for for a long time.

DO NOT BUY HERE! If you do, good luck and consider yourself warned!</Text>

I ordered my first chairs from 4Seating last Summer and and my delivery was late a couple weeks. Customer support was pretty lackluster.

I gave them a 2nd chance recently when I needed to add an extra seat to my theater in December and was given a delivery date of Feb 2. Called them up and was told it wouldn't deliver until March! Unbelievable. No warning. No help.

They do have a large selection of seating with a lot of options. Showroom is nice, but don't expect to get your order on time or for them to care after the sale.<//Text>

I just purchased a 2-seat (loveseat) from 4seating. John Jasso is the salesman who helped me. He was very helpful, very knowledgeable and very patient. I am extremely glad that I went to their showroom in La Habra (1000 S Euclid St, La Habra, CA 90631), which was 35 minutes from where I live (Irvine), because there were a lot of chairs and loveseats to choose from, and I ended up picking a different loveseat than what I thought that I wanted based on what I saw online. (I thought that I wanted one with an adjustable lumbar support, but I chose one without this feature, but which I found to be more comfortable for me.) I spent more than an hour sitting on all of the loveseats and the chairs -- sitting on each one multiple times, until it became obvious which one that I wanted -- the Seatcraft Monterey loveseat in the brown leather. He gave me a great deal as well as including a tablet/phone holder, which slides into the arm of the chair, for free. And because I live within 50 miles of their showroom, he was able to include shipping and setup (normally $199) for free. Thank you very much for your help, John. I appreciate it.</Text>

< review>
I bought the Seatcraft Venetian Love Console Recliner.  It is a row of 3 chairs, separated by 2 consoles that drop down; this way I can lay across the couch if I want, but I can also have arm rests inbetween each seat as well if desired.  I also purchased a 5 year warranty ($177) and got $300 off for memorial day weekend.  It was delivered promptly and the gentleman was very nice about getting the couch right up to my door (I did not purchase white glove delivery but had friends bring it in for me).  The couch is great, apart for not coming with brackets to link the couches together.  They are currently on standby but the customer service (I had Fernando) was very responsive and willing to work through the minor issues I had.  Very good customer service.  I also didn't have light across the console seats, so those are going to be sent to me as well.< /review>

The entire experience of purchasing a 3 seater has been a pleasure. The only reason to reduce a star is that the steel cup holders did not arrive, however the customer service agent on call was quick to understand, apologized and created a new order to deliver the accessory - thanks for the excellent service</text>

Great theather seats.  They have a really nice showroom where you can actually try all their models out.  The asssociates showed us the products and never once applied any sales pressure, which was very refreshing.  We explained that we were building a new home and wouldn’t need them for several months.  They said just call us about a month in advance to get the chairs set for delivery.  We dealt with John Jasso on the phone and he was very helpful and accommodating in meeting our needs.  I highly recommend them.< /review>

<text>Production took much longer than I expected on my first movie room and Andrew guided me through the process and even allowed me to delay the shipment after my purchase which prevented a storage headache for me. He got THE BEST DEAL on my seats compared to five other theater seat companies. The seats came well packaged and in almost flawless condition. One seat came with damage, origin of damage on the hinge is unknown. But customer service took care of that immediately. I can't remember a time with any company that the customer service took care of an issue on a high dollar item as fast as these guys. Even though my seats are not the most expensive on the site the overall quality and detail is superb. The seating is so comfortable, I've fallin asleep on 3 nonstop action movies. Overall I'm extremely pleased with my experience with 4SEATING and would suggest them to anyone looking for a theater setup.</text></record>

Dario is nothing short of OUTSTANDING and he’s to be commended for High Quality Services, Strong Committment to the organization and exceeding Customer’s Expectstuon.    I plan to inform ALL about the Great Seatings and Professional Quality Of Committed Services!!!!!1< /review>

One of the boxes was delivered in damaged condition. One of the chair corner leather was scraped. That was the delivery company problem, not the store's fault. However, 4Seating store promised me 10 weeks to replace the damage part. 10 weeks! That was Nov 21, 2015. I have contacted the store once on Jan 29. Today, Feb 28, 2016, and I still haven't gotten my replacement part. Horrible customer service. Btw, I even bought their extension  warranty.</text>

I spent over $3,000 on seats I never sat in but after talking to Jesse and going over the different model seats, and his recommendations I purchased the Seatcraft Millenia’s. I did have two issues one seat didn’t have power, which it needed a new switch and one of the seat brackets was not attaching. Jesse routed me to John Jasso and he helped fixed both issues, and even though I wanted the one seat replaced. I know how much it could cost them with shipping and taking the chair back. John made it right and because of the quality of the chair minus the small issues and their customer service.

We had a thoroughly enjoyable experience selecting and purchasing home theater seating from John at 4seating.  We diverted many miles off our intended trip in order to visit the La Habra showroom, which had a large selection of seating options from many brands.  John Jasso helped us tremendously in our selection, providing both comprehensive knowledge and honest opinions.  There is no substitute to actually sitting in furniture to choose the best option for your requirements.  We highly recommend visiting the La Habra showroom and working with John!< /text>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>The Seatcraft Napa seats are comfortable. The love seat is not a love seat but one chair with one arm and the other chair with no arms. The seat with no arms has the recliner controls on the side and when the chairs are next to each other, as pictured on their site, you can barely reach them by wedging your hand down the side. The USB is unusable due to the location. There is nothing to connect the chairs together. So, they are rarely aligned. The company recommends looking on EBAY for brackets that might work. After three phone calls, we were able to exchange the love seat chair with no arms for one with an arm. Chris was very polite during all of the calls. If you are looking for separate chairs, I would give it 4 stars. Lumbar support would bring it to 5.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<user>110549425916298346914< /user><Text>After spending weeks researching theater seating both online and in person/from stores national and local, I checked promo codes and clearances/sale day items, wanting to push my tush in the seat and see and touch the product I buy, my choice was to visit the 4 seating /La Habra CA showroom in person. I'm from N.Y., live in CA and shipping seating to AZ ..... I had a million questions and concerns. But their pricing was the best and 24 hour FREE shipping, showroom theater in-house and thousands of stock items won me over. .......... I didn't want to leave. I was in my element ........... I chose a 3 seat recliner setup with lumbar support, tray and more.

Timing for my visit turned out to be a lucky one, our salesman Dario Galvez is also their designer; courteous, patient, knowledgeable ... he was a wealth of information on every leather, fabric, accessory and feature on their stock.

On a follow up call to include their "White Glove" delivery option, speaking to John Jasso was an easy and comfortable experience. I highly recommend this vendor and suggest you take advantage of their Holiday sales.</Text>< Rate>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Extremely happy with our chairs!! We ordered 6 movie chairs and 2 risers. These chairs are very well made and the brown leather is very nice. I spoke with Alex on several occasions and he answered all my questions and was very knowledgeable and took the time to figure out which chairs best suited our needs.
I have had 2 spinal surgeries and currently awaiting my third spinal surgery, so Alex directed me on which chairs would be most comfortable for me. I would have given a 5 star rating except the delivery time was very misleading. Their site says 24 hr delivery and it took about 2 wks to arrive to their warehouse and another 3 wks to the Eastcoast. Alex did give me a tracking # when I called for it. I had several questions after the white glove company left and Alex was still of great help! He talks with us as if he is family. Granted we had a pretty large order but Alex was just first class with all of our concerns. I was very nervous about placing an order this large via online but I am very please and glad I took the leap of faith and ordered. I highly recommend this company!! I would gladly do it again!! Love our chairs!!!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

An outstanding experience with 4Seating!

I was lucky enough to be on a business trip only 15 minutes away from their location.  I stopped by and met  Alex.  He was terrific.  Took his time, let me sit in every chair, answered all my questions and gave me a great deal.

I wound up ordering 2x front row Seatcraft Monterey Black Leather Power LAF Recliners and 2x back row of the same.

These seats are wonderful.  I'm coming from Berkline powered recliners and these are every bit as comfortable and the powered headrest is awesome.  They are also faster to recline than the Berkline's and quieter as well.   I just wished there was a way to have my Media Room continue to smell like the leather from these seats.  It's wonderful!

The seats came packaged very well and in perfect condition.  There was a small issue with the phone/tablet holder which was quickly resolved by 4Seating with a replacement on it's way.

Can't say enough about this company, the service, Alex, and the seats themselves.

Looking forward to adding more!<//review>

Not knowing how comfortable it would be etc. Spoke to their customer service before placing my order. Firstly,  i was impressed that they answer the phone right away and i wasnt on hold listening to a machine. Spoke with their representative John Jasso who was amaazing and very knowlegable about their products. Answered each and every question till i felt comfortable going ahead with my order. He was really helpful during our shipment time as well as after our order was delivered to us. Would highly recommend this site. And customer service is excellent.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Buying Furniture Online....are you kidding......NO

While many people are SO QUICK to respond with negative experiences, I wanted to respond with the opposite!  John Jasso has been great to work with!  He's been professional, (easy to skirt around professionalism when your purchase is "invisible" because it's an internet transaction).  Additionally, all my questions, concerns and/or problems have been met with timely (if not immediate) and helpful communications and left me feeling IMPORTANT.  When my husband and I considered buying furniture online, it was met with a great deal of intrepidation.  All of the things that could go wrong we thought of, product quality, customer service, delivery, how it would fit our body types, trueness of color, fill the room, and more.  To date, we have had absolutely NO REGRETS.  We have a special thank you to John Jasso and to the whole team that has made our trust in your company unwavering and worth our time to PAUSE and share this message!  Thank you!</review>< pictures>

Ordered row of four Barcalounger Solaris seats - excellent seats, highly recommended. Found a small tear on the back on an armrest, 4Seating was quick to respond without fuss, and has shipped out a replacement.  Customer service was excellent.  Pulled one star for misleading sales practices - Seats are prominently advertised as being equipped with Sound Shaker technology that " vibrates the chair in sync with the on-screen action!"  - except that it doesn't, because you need additional Sound Shaker equipment to make it work. In other words, the seats are equipped with only one part of the sound shaker system, parts that do absolutely nothing on their own - you need to buy the additional Sound Shaker amplifier (several hundred dollars) and nowhere, anywhere, can I find anything that says so.  The site lists the seats as equipped with "Sound Shaker", and gives you every indication (including a video)  that the sound shaker system is a complete functioning feature, when in reality, the seats are only equipped with the traducers,  useless items on their own that will not work without additional costly parts. This is deceptive and unnecessary -  having the transducers is worthwhile if you plan to have the sound shaker system, but 4Seating should be more upfront and forthcoming with what you are actually getting.<//Text>

In April 2017 we purchased the Seatcraft Sierra Cream Leather 7000 Power Straight Row of 3 theater seating. When they arrived, the boxes were a little beat up but once unpacked and set up in our room they are beautiful. We absolutely love them. However a couple weeks ago one of the chairs stopped power reclining and we were initially a bit upset due to the cost of the chairs and the quick malfunction. We placed a call to 4seating and have been in contact with account representative John Jasso who has been amazing to work with. Not only did he try to help get the chair fixed quickly via helpful instructions, but once he realized it was a not fixable, he sent out the replacement part quickly and apologetically. Mr. Jasso also followed up with us not only by email but follow up phone calls as well. Being in Customer Service for many years, I am extremely satisfied with Mr. Jasso and 4seating for fixing the malfunction in my chair. I strongly suggest purchasing the warranty for piece of mind and also if ordering the Soundshaker kit, make sure you ask for the install instructions. We have not been able to install our kit as we are still waiting for the instructions to be mailed to us as they were inadvertently left out of the original order.<//text>
