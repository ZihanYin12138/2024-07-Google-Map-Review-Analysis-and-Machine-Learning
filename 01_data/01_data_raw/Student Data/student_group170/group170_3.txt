Fastest smog check ever! No need for appointment. Even with 3 customers in front of you, you are in and out fast. Highly recommend. I've been coming for years. Prices are also great.< /review>

<text>I have a habit of returning to places that I'm happy with and I am very happy with this place. I will need to get my vehicle smogged every so often and when I do, I come here. The guy that works here is always hustling to get the customers in and out as fast as he can. Hard working and professional, I appreciate him and I'm confident you will too!< /text>< Time>

<Text>I have a 2004 Ford that my wife never drives, but it is in great shape and I love it, but I took it to smog and it failed. The owner, asked how we use it, and when I told him, he helped me get it to pass LEGALLY! Really. His name is Greg. Not every car will pass.depends on age and circumstances.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

The guy running this place is incredibly friendly. Had some good conversation while the test was going on and he's been working on cars in some capacity since he was a teen. Had some feedback on a car I just bought and even tighten down the battery terminal connections when he found they were loose. The shop isn't in my area but I'll drive out here again to visit this guy.</Review>

Greg helped me out with my smog today and made the process very quick and easy. As a first time patron he was able to give me $10 dollars off his regular $61.75  pricing. The entire process took less than 15 minutes and I couldn't be happier with his service.

Ask about the other services around him since it looked like they are all supporting each other.<//Text>

I needed a smog done last min. Didn't realize my car needed it before I could get my registration. Called around and found Vista smog. Thought it was part of the car wash next door but its separate. No appointments taken but there wasn't much of a wait. There was a car right before us and when it was our turn it was so quick and easy. The man did it all him self and submitted all paper work needed to DMV through there system. Great friendly fast service. Great reasonable price. Definitely will be returning here for all my future smog needs. Thank you<//text>

A+ the guy there is cool and friendly. Took my truck there 3 times in one day cuz my oxygen sensor wasn't reading for a smog. The guy was very cool every time he check it and on the 3rd try it passed. He was as happy as I was that it passed. Very fast service. Definitely going back to smog my other cars..... And there open on Sunday!!!!</Review>

Anyone in need of a Smog? I highly recommend this place! As a girl I always fear being swindled into paying more or for extra stuff that  I really don't need... Greg was extremely professional and generous and charged me a lot less than other places I had called. So glad I came here, thank you so much Greg for an awesome first time Smog check experience 😊< /Text>

<Text>This place is conveniently located right off the 10 freeway,  and exit Vincent Avenue, right next to the car wash.   The owner: Greg,  is a very friendly guy with a warm and helping attitude.   You can sit comfortably inside of the shop and wait for about 10 minutes to have him performing the smog check with no stress!

Even though I'm frustrated that my car isn't passing smog, this guy was very nice and calming. He even let me have a freebie!!! He does have a thick accent and he is very assertive, but that's because he gets it done fast!< /review>

The  guy barely spoke English. I took an old car to him and he refused to test it because he thought it would "break the machine." He didn't even test my car and I had to take it somewhere else. If he doesn't want to test old cars, he should have a sign up somewhere saying that he doesn't know what he's doing. I will NEVER take any more cars to him NOR do I recommend him, especially if you have an older car.</text>

I love the thrift store Angel View! I've been shopping the Palm Desert location whenever I am in town.
Now for 8 years! I always find a little treasure there! Or a big one lol
Once I found  2 Queen Anne chairs and had them recovered! My family loves them! I hope they don't get rid of the furniture section.< /Text>

<review>I really enjoyed this place. Was looking for books to give as a gift, and this place had a great selection. The best part was though, definitely Karen. She greeted everyone when they walked in and was very sweet to me. I went to two other stores before this and the customer service was very different between Karen and those other people. If I ever need to come back, I will only go to this location because of how nice Karen was.<//review>< username>

Very rude people. If I could, I would give them a Zero Star. Not helpful at all. I was asking if they had something to put underneath furniture so I wouldn't scratch it and one lady (the meanest of all) told me they couldn't give anything for free. I never asked for free stuff.. just to give me something that would work..I would pay for it. Worst customer service, ask me when I am buying there again? NEVER!< /review>

Way overpriced. Bought a pair of capris. Looked wrinkled. $5.99.  Brought home, laundered. Ironed with a medium iron. That's when I realized all the elastic shot. Looked on could have purchased new $25.</review>

<time>1551348321150<//time><rate>4< /rate><review>#1  I just left Nordstrom Rack and Angel View had darling things at a 1/4 of the price while NR looked like it should be the thrift store.
#2 Its organized by style and then displayed by color - SO much easier! (we don't always know what size we wear but we DO know the colors we like)
#3 It's clean
#4 The staff were really helpful & pleasant!
#5  I like to have choices and Angel View happened to be a better choice over Nordstrom Rack!!!
Thanks Angel View!
P.S. We need an Angel View to open in Santa Cruz where I reside!</review>< Pics>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>The problem with Angel view is over price items! They need not to forget that items were donated and items sold is is to help and reach out for the lower income families! I've seen multiple items way more expensive that the retail stores prices. Some are decent but some are ridiculous over price

Ive also pointed many times in different stores about knockoff items on display! Not being original and selling like if it was original at almost retail price! Be aware in spending high cash in believing its original do your homework first!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) I often go to this store for pastry items and something that I find extra, I don't buy clothes because they give it at almost the same price as new, what I don't understand is because they charge tax if all the items that are sold there already paid tax (no they are new)? 🤔
I had an experience that had come out of there with an article that I tried to get home and it didn't work. I left home in 5 minutes. The same boy attended me and didn't want to return the money because he had forgotten the ticket, he had just sold it to me I live very close to it and I really couldn't find the ticket. It was very difficult to get my money back when my card and payment were registered, they are very inaccessible for returns.

(Original)
Voy seguido a esta tienda por artículos de repostería y algo que me encuentre extra, ropa no compro porque la dan casi al mismo precio que nueva, lo que no entiendo es porque cobran tax si todos los artículos que ahí se venden ya pagaron tax (no son nuevos)? 🤔
Tuve una experiencia que había salido de ahí con un artículo que llegando a casa probé y no funcionaba salí de casa en 5 minutos llegue el mismo muchacho me atendió y no quería regresarme el dinero xq había olvidado el ticket, el me lo acababa de vender, vivo muy cerca de ahí y realmente no encontraba el ticket fue muy difícil hacer que me regresarán mi dinero cuando ahí se registró mi tarjeta y mi pago, son muy inaccesibles para devoluciones.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) To this store do not vallan.mi people there are well razistas the employees are Latinas and the truth q speak badly of the Latinos being that they are also Latinas .. they are good despotas .. another thing grabs something and has a price and the cashier he thinks it's not fair, they do not sell it to you ... they grab you, pass on shame ... I do not recommend it ...

<date>1619886602671<//date><rating>2</rating><Text>Overall the place has a lot to offer. Especially if you like tennis or swimming. The weight room is average but they are updating some equipment so that’s nice. My dissatisfaction with this gym comes more from the management rather than the facility itself. Upon signing up we given some 3 day passes and verbatim told “Give these passes to your friends and family and if they use them and sign up we will give you a month for free!” Awesome right? So we did exactly that began telling friends and family finally we found some friends who were interest and what did they do? They used the 3 day passes and liked the gym and it’s location so they signed up! Sweet so we should be receiving our free month we were promised right? Wrong. They lied. Or I guess forgot to mention you have to be with them when they sign up... pretty ridiculous if you ask me, considering we did our part. People have lives, you know like work, family time, ext. you’d like me to coordinate with every family I recommend to your gym? Like I said overall the gym isn’t bad and the staff is friendly. But just don’t fall for that like I did. I won’t be recommending any friends or family from here on out.</Text>< Pics>

Do NOT come here. They randomly charged me for 3 months while they were closed, and I already cancelled my account. Only refunded the months they were closed for, but still stole around $100 from me. The manager had horrible customer service did not try to make our experience better in any way. Coming here you would think customer service is dead but I know of other places that would refund you and give you a free month or at least something to compensate the mistake they made. I'm already poor and cannot afford to to sue or even come here and now I am even more so. Just go to the y it's better anyways.</Text>

< Review>
I received zero help when I called before my next billing cycle and needed to cancel my membership for the upcoming month due to coronavirus affecting my business. I stuck with the gym and paid my membership when they had to be closed down due to the virus. As a local nonprofit  founder and a disabled veteran - I expect the same consideration and honor given to me.< /Review>

All accounts were frozen until we were able to open and offer services again.   Unfortunately we cannot cancel memberships over the phone for security reasons, so we do ask that all status changes are in writing so we can ensure that the person cancelling is in fact the person on the account.'}<//response><Gmap_id>0x54d294b7b1702191:0x2d57fa4b4cd024eb</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have been a member of Sun Oaks for a few years, off and on.  I always come back to Sun Oaks!  I love the group classes, especially Group Active.  Kama is my favorite instructor.  Always with a smile and warm demeanor, she welcomes the class to perform at varying levels according to what feels comfortable and right.  Sun Oaks has a lot of class offerings and a lot of times to choose from.  They're awesome!<//review><gmap_id>0x54d294b7b1702191:0x2d57fa4b4cd024eb<//gmap_id>< Resp>

The staff is very unprofessional and rude at times. The staff is disorganized, unable to answer questions in a timely manner... and present themselves in a condescending manner. One of them actually told me I was wasting their time at one point! The daycare requires reservations, in which they will charge you if you are late. The daycare is also open for a few hours on weekends. The gym in whole is stuck up and doesn’t help the community in the same way the YMCA does. The rates are outrageous and they don’t offer nearly as many classes as the Y does. Went here for eight months... worst gym I have ever been to.<//review>

Pretty okay cool place. The water is really hard to swim in and I don’t know why, but it sure does give you a workout. Especially doing laps, the way they have the lanes set delivers an extreme challenge for swimming. Amazing workout. Would recommend</text>

Sun Oaks is an amazing fitness club! My wife and I have been going for almost a year now, and we are so glad that we made the decision to join!

They have extremely friendly and helpful staff, and as far as activities go, they have something for everyone. Indoor and outdoor tennis courts, basketball courts, swimming pools, and even a racquetball court! They have enough classes to keep someone occupied for years - and new classes all the time. They even host community events and barbecues! They serve everyone from families, to professional athletes, and everywhere in between.

Some other reviewers have said that their equipment is old - but that's just not the case. My wife and I see new equipment coming in all the time. And to top it all off? If you've never seen the sunrise over the lawn surrounding the tennis courts - you don't know what you're missing. It is the absolute BEST way to start out the day! We cannot recommend Sun Oaks enough!< /Text>

<Review>I have been a member just under a year and my life has been bettered in so many ways. I am...ahem...60 something and needed weight and cardio. The choices were abundant. I tried a few classes and loved each one so much! I am a regular in the Group Power and Ride 30 classes and did my first Group Fight class today. All of the instructors are quick to help me figure out what is best for me. And after all these months, I am doing so well that I lift more weight than many of those younger than me. (Not that we are into competing.) Sun Oaks is such a great family. Come join us!<//Review>< pictures>

Great gym! has awesome customer service, and provides many group fitness classes, multiple pools (heated lap pool), sauna, tennis courts, and even has a protein shake, and beer tap for post workout. Never felt so motivated to go to the gym.
Keep up the good work.<//Review>

I love Sun Oaks! I joined just to swim laps in their outdoor covered pool but they have tons of exercise classes, workout rooms, indoor and outdoor tennis and basketball, etc... It's also affordable and family-friendly.<//text>

My family was a big part of the club since the day it was built. Non stop support from my family. Big in the tennis community. I have gone there since I was a small child and now I’m 23. Recently my family’s membership was canceled by the owners for reasons that are childish. I am currently a service member in the armed forces and my family gets treated poorly by the people who run this establishment. If possible I recommend giving your business to another sports club. If you want to go there for the tennis program, don’t. The person who runs it is Jeremiah and is not that good of a person. He’s a liar and a cheat who uses and abuses his power when he doesn’t get his way. So please, if you can avoid giving them business that would be spectacular.<//review>

<Time>1518123648702< /Time><Review>Child Care: You have to schedule child care ahead of time because they want one staff per three children.  Seems nice at first, sounds like your child will get enough supervision.  But getting approval to get your kid into child care is half the battle.  If you do get approval then you have one hour to complete your workout.  And what is the point of the 3:1child-to-adult ratio if they're going to plop the kids in front of the TV?  First 2-3 times we took our 3-yr old he got into trouble and were asked to leave.  Again what is the point of the supervision ratio if they're not going to be supervised?

Group Classes: Get there 5-10 minutes early and push your way through the doors to get a spot.  Then spend the first 5-10 minutes setting up your station, now you're already 10-20 minutes in.  That is, of course, if the class before gets out on time.  If you're attending Group Power then 15-20% of the class is changing out weights or adjusting your station.  Depending on your instructor you might get guidance on how to do the moves or else try to keep up, and you might hear music with rated R language</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

Sun Oaks is a very friendly place to go workout. Myself being handicapped I have found the other gyms kind of shrug me off, but Sun Oaks has a program setup for seniors whether you're disabled or not and they are extremely wonderful with us. I would highly recommend them to anyone. My husband also likes their regular gym and weight room</text>

Great Tennis facility and coaching. I started out knowing nothing about Tennis except that European people played it and made a bunch of grunting noises while swinging their racquets. Their free beginners classes on Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings built me up to be competitive in the USTA leagues that are hosted at the club!< /review>

The people here were very rude and snooty. Not good hospitality at all and very unfriendly. No signs saying 'NO DOGS' so no reason to be rude when someone brings a dog. I would never come back here because of how I was treated. Maybe instead of yelling at clients and swearing at them, they can learn how to use some manners. I only used one stare because the website wouldn't let me put zero stars.<//Text>

<review>I've been a member at Sun Oaks for over ten years now. I've had my ups and downs with the place but the staff is friendly and helpful. The negative is often the pool can be really busy and it is not helped by the amount of activities they book at the pool. You learn the times to go and times to avoid.<//review><response>None< /response></record>

Dont use this place for body comp tests.  Their machine doesnt weigh you.  They have a bathroom scale to weigh you.  When I went, the scale was broken.  So the lady running it asked me to guess ny weight. Lol!! You cant do that.  Further...i know the body fat percentage was wrong.  So she asked me to guess another weight.  Its funny because the exact same body fat percentage came out with another weight.  That didnt seem to be a red flag to her at all. I was bummed at first.   Went somewhere else and got the right numbers.  I cant believe what a shitshow that was.</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) An athletic center with tennis, swimming, gym and group sports. There's a lot of training for kids as well as adults, and you can leave the facility for kids two hours a day.

(Original)
테니스와 수영, 짐과 그룹운동이 모두 가능한 운동센터. 어른만 아니라 아이들을 위한 트레이닝도 많고 아이들을 위한 놀이시설에 하루 2시간 맡길 수도 있어요.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I haven't been inside this store I visit someone next to the store so my gps shows   I visited, I will eventually but from the looks of the place is very nice and kept up on the outside parking lot is always clean and well kept. I can't rate this a 5 star which I'm sure it is until I go inside I'm gonna give it a 3 star.</Review>

I grew up going here. I wantwd a lotto ticket where they would punch in my numbers but the man told me I had to do it even I had a ticket with numbers I wanted. The store looks nicer but prices are too high and Ill never go back after 50 years.</text>

DO NOT COME HERE. If the older gentleman and older woman are here. I tried to get a melt and add veggies on it. Apparently that is a violation of sandwich protocol lol that CAN NOT be done. It does not follow the rules of sandwich making lol. Plus I tried to add mayo... my fault. I had no idea you were only allowed one sauce ? Lol I will be going to my other sandwich places more often AND tipping them more when I get an extra sauce lol. Thanks for the dry melt Subway.< /text>

<text>Subway is my go to sandwich place. Affordable healthy food. I suppose you can call it fast food, I just call it good food. I was surprised to learn that the chain is even larger then McDonald's. The only minor drawback, is that they generally have coffee available. That a bummer for a caffeine freak like me.< /text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The Manager has a very bad attitude with customers. When my family and I  stepped into the store,  in hand was a coupon, she said store do not accept coupons.  Then we ordered 4, 6-inch meat balls at regular price, she only added a little lecture and 2 small slices tomato in our first 2 sandwiches.  We then asked to add other different vegetables onto the sandwiches, we were very surprised and said;  “meatball don’t go with that” and wrapped our sandwiches, I’m very disappointed and frustrated. She then raised her voice and yelled at me “here or to-go” then I said be “polite and be nice with your customers”. She refused to sell foods to us.  She also said to us “this is not China” as she recognized us as an Asian family,.  Finally, she refused to sell foods to us.  I tried to remain  calm as my family and I walked out.

5 minutes later I waited until no more customers inline, I walked in and I said be polite and asked to give her name out, store number, and phone number of the customer service.  She refused and said “no name” and said “go to subway online” , “go away”, and she immediately pulled her phone out and called police, I really don’t think I am doing anything wrong.  My son (16 years old) and I are the people in-line to order foods, he very surprised with this kind of customer service that he has ever experienced with this before.  He told me if he could do ratings he wished we have “zero” star or negative for this store that he can try the best to give out.  Moreover, please be careful of what she said to the customer “this is not in China”.  Very very bad customer services< /Review>

<review>I would give zero if possible. I pointed out a cockroach in the bell peppers, did not make a large deal about it. Turned into the lady aggressively yelling at me and telling me I could no longer eat at her store. Which is fine, cause that's disgusting, but she was a complete wacko. Eat here at your own risk.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808fec0aba491903:0x83ff50c6c0dedfa9<//Gmap_id></record>

Don’t eat at Stoneridge Subway. My kids got the juice they forgot to charge and the owner started yelling saying my 4 years old stole the juice, and they are little thieves. Very hostile behaviors towards the kids. We had to call the police to calm her down. Horrible services. I will never ever eat or recommend my friends or family.</text>

My son ordered a chop salad and he had asked for creamy siracha and south west chipotle sauce as a dressing instead the manager put caeser salad dressing which contained anchovies and he did not want admit it. My son asked him to remake the salad because he is vegetarian and does not eat seafood. He refused it and made us pay for it. Don’t order your sandwiches from here. Bad customer service.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Writing this review, while being at the subway. I have eaten at Subway thousands of times, in multiple cities and multiple countries and I can confidently say that this is the worst Subway I have ever been too.

I visited this place a couple of months ago and while making my sandwich I asked for more peppers(I had only few veggies) and the guy was like No. I said what?? He replied they have a formula and will only add that much, surprised? Apparently, he was scared of the owners, who is a huge Cheapooo and arrogant too. She started arguing with me, I just kept my calm and moved on.

Today again, they we're putting so little veggies, I did not bother to ask for more as I remembered they are the cheapest people. This time my sandwich had Guac in it. While billing, she first did not add that and guy pointed it to her to add cost for that. Now she looks at me and says "Isne dasya nahi mainu--He did not tell me (with annoyed look)". This was extremely rude. I was not being asked anything. I would never eat at this Subway again.

Meanwhile, she was complaining of less business. What an irony!<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Geez dude (the unsmiling angry son) needs to get out and travel. Have some fun.  See the world, go to the beach and play frisbee or something cuz you are a terrible shop keeper.
This family should NOT  be in  retail or food service.

<Review>The customer service was awful. I didn't realize at first that there was a specific system  for the order in which you order the toppings, so I asked for lettuce and tomato, and the lady at the counter raised her voice saying "NO! NO Lettuce! CHEESE FIRST. What kind of CHEESE?" It was very rude and disrespectful. Never coming here again.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808fec0aba491903:0x83ff50c6c0dedfa9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I don't usually make bad reviews, sometimes I prefer to ignore that I was in the place, but this SUBWAY is the worst. The employees seem that they do not have a salary, they serve you obliged, it is a bad image for the Mall where it is located. Sorry, but I ask you to improve its quality or it would be better if you closed it.

(Original)
No suelo hacer malos reviews, en ocasiones prefiero ignorar que estuve en el lugar, pero este SUBWAY es el peor. Los empleados pareciese que no tienen un sueldo, te atienden obligado, es una mala imagen para el Mall donde se encuentra ubicado. Lo siento, pero les pido que mejoren su calidad o sería mejor que lo cerraran.< /text>

Good enclosed park, but hard to find parking. It's in the middle of a neighborhood. There are courts and a baseball diamond.</review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Great place for kids or adult baseball games.  The baseball field has a pretty deep backstop, pretty small dugouts but it has a fence, built in batting cage (beyond he fence) and great scenery in background for a fielder (except at sundown which can be extremely difficult to see).  During evening games you have to be prepared both for heat and cold, once the fog rolls in.  Overall one of the best fields that are just outside San Francisco.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f7c3f950b419f:0xf40a01911d85fcde</gmap_id></record>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>Located in a poorer suburb area, this little park seemed safe and familial. The woodchips were brand new and the lawn was immaculate. 3 basketball courts. No public restrooms, though, and pets are not allowed, although it doesn't seem to be strictly enforced. Also, the upstairs fountain doesn't work, though the downstairs one does. 1 star off for these small faults.< /Text><Rate>4< /Rate><Time>1314128154281</Time><UserId.>102588582260636161072</UserId.>< GmapID>

This place is great! Not too busy, great atmosphere and prices. We tried Pork Ramen, Steak Udon, Gyoza, fried calamari, and tempura green tea ice cream for dessert. Everything exceeded my expectations. Friendly staff and little Japanese-ee touches throughout. Will be coming back soon.</Review>

Rolls were ok at best. Cheaper ingredients used. No sauces offered or included in takeout bag. Even got my order wrong. SHOBU sushi is awesome but they were closed today so I tried this place.</Text>

Went here with my husband tonight and we both loved it! Amazing customer service and their sushi was delicious. I had the popcorn lobster roll and he had a baked roll (don’t remember the name) prices are reasonable. Planning to come back soon during their happy hour.</text>

Jono's is the place for delicious, fresh sushi in the Corona/Norco. The restaurant is small, cozy, and relaxed with some of the friendliest staff you'll find anywhere. The spicy edamame is a garlicky delight and the Hidden Valley, Johnny Lucas and Lemon rolls were outstanding.

This is not an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, which makes me happy, but it is reasonably priced for the quality. If you are looking for smaller bites at a discount they do have happy hours at various times of day.

Jono's is a true find and we're lucky to have them in the area!<//Text>

My fiancé, son & I  came for the happy hour rolls, and they were so good! They had great service. The manager (I believe it was the manager, the male server) made sure to make my son was happy! (2yr old) we will be back again soon.< /Review>

Ono’s is for sure worth 5 stars! We went for Mother’s Day and they were booked with reservations thru 7:45pm, however, they were also taking walk ins, and the wait is 100% worth it. They will offer you drinks while you wait and the service was quick and attentive! They do not cook in front of you, but the food is even better than Shogun! My husband and I both ordered the combination and added lobster tail. The prices were perfect, and the food amazing! We also shared jalapeno bombs (similar to a heart attack) and a Philadelphia roll. We were seated and done in less than an hour! We placed our order thinking we would have to wait, but the food started coming! I am amazed with this place and the food, I can’t say it enough, AMAZING! I can’t wait to go back! Oh and if you like cold flavored Sake, the Mango was to die for! Yum!</text>

We love it here for Monday date nights.  We always get out chicken fried rice because it's the best.  Ono and his wife are great people always happy to walk to and always serve great food.  Our only Concern is the waiter that we have to deal with.  Maybe he is family skme how but he isn't very pleasant nor does he get your order correct.  Kinda a bummer when your trying to enjoy a nice meal<//text>

japanese food, so good. Entered near eleven, it wasn't packed. Will surely make a return trip. The bill was good for what you get. Food is similar to a cafe in Indianapolis I liked.< /text>

Delicious food!! Tried the tiger sushi roll and the salmon crunch roll both were fantastic! Hands down the best fried rice ive ever tasted. Very tasty! Also tried the caramel apple dessert and it was fantastic!!! I give them 4 stars because our table was ignored a bit. They took forever to bring out an extra side bowl of fried rice and didnt include any wasabi with the rolls. Had to ask for some and the girl forgot to bring it. Got to have it with the last piece of the salmon crunch roll. I definitelt will go again and hope the service is a little better.<//Review>

Sushi rice was below average.
The Teppan option is a good value.</Review>

Only can comment on ramen.

Service was excellent and very accommodating. Even though they stopped serving ramen at lunch they still made it for us for dinner. The owner was very generous to us and friendly. 5 stars for service.

Ramen was basic and nothing special. It was a decent ramen for the price. So more of 3 stars for ramen.< /Text>

I eat here a at least twice a month. Service is good. Happy hour deals are great. Their bento meals are so filing! My mom loves their teriyaki beef. Their sushi is fresh. I'm super weird about raw fish but trust this place enough to eat raw fish even when its hot out. I would reccomended this place to anyone who wants good sushi and a bonus is it won't break the bank!<//Review>

<text>Pretty good food. Went there for Mothers Day. Not sure if the entire menu was available but we ordered off the much smaller menu they gave us. Each mother was given a rose which was a very nice touch. 5 star not given for small reasons. The Mother Trucker omelotte and potatoes needed a little more taste.....like maybe adding bell peppers to it. Ketchup handed out in packets.....we like it out of a bottle. Coffee came in a paper cup......we prefer a real ceramic mug. Definitely worth a visit. Black Bear Diner still number 1 around here.</text>< Rate>

This is a great place to eat.  The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed with plenty of TRUCK parking.  Prices are reasonable.  I would give here 5 stars but my only complaint is their opening hours on Mondays...10am?  And the rest of the week is 7:30am?  Overall a great place to eat.< /Review>

When you first come in to the parking lot of the diner you're welcomed by the singing sheriff. He's a great guy. When you get inside there's a big menu with amazing food. The prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly.<//Text>

<response>None</response><username>Daren Barbo< /username><Review>Had to pick up a load down the street and stopped in because I saw all the reviews and it was convenient location because there is truck parking. Got the Bandit breakfast sandwich, came with country potatoes. Was hardly worth the price, similar to a grand slam sandwich from Dennys but twice the price and the potatoes were mushy, not even fried like they're supposed to be. Don't waste ur time, only good thing is the convenience factor for truckers.</Review><Gmap_id>0x809207ee82532169:0xcc112bebf4de452</Gmap_id><time>1556346496568< /time><pictures>None</pictures>< user>

<review>Truck Stop Cafe located inside large T&A Produce Company location in Spreckels, Ca. Plenty of food. Breakfast today was disappointing. The food has always been good in the past but I haven't been there in quite awhile. Owners, Don & Cherl Ferch, are usually hands on & Don is a Cordon Bleu chef. They weren't there today.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Hubby is a truck driver so everytime we're in the area we come here! The food is always soooo good and the bathrooms are always clean (if you live a trucker life you know what I mean) lol....My 3 year old ordered a pancake and he was given one in the shape of Mickey mouse which he loved :)< /Text>

I'm a truck driver and this cafe is in the parking area for the produce shipper Timara & Antle. They are a little pricey but well worth every penny! Great food, large portions, reminds me of a waffle house only cleaner! They cook the food right out in front.<//Text>

Food is ok. Overpriced in my opinion.  Fries shouldn't be $1.50 extra with the sandwich.  Who wants to pay over $10 for fries and a plain old burger. Need more variety such as chopped steak, or spaghetti.  Even hot turkey or roast beef sandwich would do the trick.  The breakfast is not too bad. Pancakes are overpriced.  Dennys has better priced and tasty pancakes</review>

Dr. Chung is extremely kind and caring. He was genuinely interested in me and my teeth. He cleaned my teeth very well and gave me tips on how to better take care of my teeth. I’m so glad I found him!<//Text>

I would recommend this dentist and his staff any day! They are very friendly and make you feel comfortable. They explain everything you need done and the charges so your not surprised if you get a bill. Did not hurt me at all which is a plus!!</text>

<Time>1621026557582<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>This was our first visit to see Dr Chung after changing dentists so the visit was referring to a comprehensive questionnaire, X-rays and an initial analysis of of any dental issues revealed in the X-rays. Dr .Chung’s first question to me was “ what are your concerns?”He listens  and explains everything without being an alarmist. He provides alternative ways to best solve the dental issue. His staff is also top notch.... welcoming, professional, and just lovely to deal with. Four stars only because we are just beginning our “journey “ with Dr Chung. But my wife and I left the office feeling great relief that we at last  had found the right dentist.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

🦷 💯 I’m terrified of dental work. Let me repeat that... I’M TERRIFIED OF DENTAL WORK!!!! I had met Dr. Chung & his staff a week or so ago to have them check out a painful tooth. He was willing to extract it right there & then but I chickened out & asked to be rescheduled. You know, so I can “prepare” for the upcoming event of having a tooth pulled as a grown woman. The day came. I was unable to find a driver & that meant zero medications for my anxiety. I almost chickened out. But I went for it anyhow. They made me feel so comfortable at the previous visit and I felt I was in good hands. I get there nervous & ready to run. LOL. They called me back & I explained how nervous & flat out scared I was. Dr. Chung literally sat there, explained everything in layman’s term, put the numbing gel in & I waited for the injection soon to come. When he came in to do it my heart was racing. I asked if he could tell me what he was doing & walk me through it since my eyes were slammed shut. He did & I honestly didn’t believe him! I didn’t feel a damn thing! Not even the medication. You know that burning, painful feeling? Yeah...non of that. I. Didn’t. Feel. A. Thing! Perfection! So after being numb he decided to let it get to where he could numb me more. He then started his work. I felt slight pressure, heard the slightest crack & no joke after a few minutes I asked if it was out & it had been out! He was doing the after care, bone graft, & suturing. I’m never going ANYWHERE else! EVER! Between him & his staff I was very well taken care of, they are very down to earth people, and just overall exceptional professionals.♥️Them!!!!</Review>

My first visit to see Dr. Chung went very well. The staff and Dr. were professional, reassuring, and friendly.  I received care and information that was new to me and very helpful. They informed me about the care plan for me, gave me clear reasons for it and informed me of what   my costs will be.<//Review>

My first visit was a pleasant surprise! The staff and Dr. Chung were so friendly and caring. They took time to explain procedures and options and made sure I was comfortable and pain free. As a nervous dental patient with bad past experiences this was so important to me. I can say I have found my new dentist.< /text>

<review>I have to start by saying it was such a BLESSING to have my dental work done by DR. JOHN W. CHUNG! His office is soo reassuring in every way you can imagine! Its super sanitized and he even has air purifiers everywhere u look, from the waitting room lobby all the way through to the patient exam/procedure room! DR. JOHN W. CHUNG level of patience, compassion, dental knowledge and quality of care is the best i've ever encountered period! He takes his time to fully convey short term and long term options in detail and answer all my questions I had.... Typically dental work and pain go hand in hand with all my prior experiences ...but that wasn't the case with DR. JOHN W. CHUNG , he diligently addressed my pulsing broken tooth and my experience was completely pain-free, hence my anxiety evaporated in full!! DR. JOHN W. CHUNG and his staff TERESA(front office) & SWAN (om/back office) displayed the highest caliber of professionalism and genuine care possible!!❤ This dental office Glows with INTEGRITY from the moment you walk in to the very last second your discharged! My appointment was phenomenal! Thank you a million DR. JOHN W. CHUNG and staff and God bless you for all you do!!</review>< pics>

Very informative, professional and friendly:) Dr. Danny and his team took great care of my son during his sedation dental procedure. Of course at first I was very nervous but all my worries were quickly laid to rest by the care and treatment he showed my son, even after the procedure his follow up care is exceptional:) would highly recommend to anyone who has kids whom are difficult when it comes to the dentist.

I saw Dr.Chung for my dental issues and had a great experience. Very calming and informative, the staff is friendly and very helpful, you generally feel that they care for each and every patient. Im so grateful my children and I have a trusted dentist to go too:)</Text>

The staff was extremely professional and helpful. I came in on the wrong day and they did everything in their power to make it so I could be seen by the doctor. Every single member of the team made the experience so positive. Dr Chung really cares and makes you feel taken care of. He's gentle and talks you through each step. I feel very thankful to have him as a dentist. I travel 2 hours to see him. Dentists that you can trust are hard to come by.< /text>

The office is very knowledgeable kind and work excellent as a team. The approach that they take to explain it to my little granddaughter age 5, was really a great pleasant experience for her.  As far as it goes for me they listened, they explained it and took the time with my granddaughter and I.  I would highly recommend this dental office to anyone and everyone.

Dr. Danny is the best dentist he’s really good with children and he answers parents’ questions with all this great information and details. I give him 4 stars only because the wait to see him is too long. We were there exactly a week ago, our appointment was at 12:30pm and they brought us in at 1:20pm. They did the cleaning on my son and then we had to wait for Dr. Danny for the exam until 2:10pm. We were out of there exactly at 2:30pm. All this wait for a simple cleaning. I hope they improve their waiting time because we love Dr. Danny.<//Review>

I was pleasantly surprised with my visit with Dr. Chung since my previous dental experience was disappointing. Dr. Chung and his staff were very cordial and made me feel comfortable. The exam and explanations I received were thorough. I am very happy that I discovered this dental office.<//text>

I felt comfortable with him and did not feel as if he was just trying to pad the bill.  I appreciate kindness and honesty.   He did a fantastic job cleaning my teeth!

<rate>5< /rate><review>My son got seen by Dr. Chung yesterday for the first time and it’s been the best experience for him so far . He isn’t a happy camper when he has to get treatment for his teeth but the staff and the doctor made him feel so comfortable that he walked out happy .Dr Chung was very professional and very patient, thank you. It was a huge relief seeing him not scared and instead walking out happy.

You guys are awesome . I would give more than 5 stars if I could .<//review>< GmapID>

Dr. Chung is the most personable dentist. He genuinely seems to care about your well-being - taking the time to sit with you and explain the diagnosis and alternatives. His office staff are equally friendly and caring. I never feel as though I’m ‘upsold’ on a service or treatment.< /Review>

I had an estimate of cost and recommended procedures from 2 other highly reviewed dentists.

I do not recommend it, everything is very badly organized, they meet you at an hour and they attend you 2 hours later, they are not professional because they do not know how to organize their time and people have jobs to do</Review>

Dr. Danny is a wonderful pediatric dentist and takes such great care of his young patients and their families. We would highly recommend him to parents seeking a kind, caring dentist. Dr. Danny’s front staff is also very professional, kind and caring.</review>

Dr. Chung is not only the best dentist I've ever met, but one of the best men. Unmatched. He's truly kind, and genuinely views the well being of his patients as paramount. Suhan (of Dr. Chung's staff) was absolutely incredible to work with, dedicated and compassionate. You could not possibly regret coming to this place, and I will be returning for years to come.<//Text>

<Review>DR. CHUNG IS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST DENTISTS THAT YOU CAN TRUST IN ANY SITUATION THAT YOU AND I ARE IN...HE DOESN'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH AND SPEAKS WHAT HIS PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND HIS ADVICE TOWARDS ALL HIS PATIENTS IN WHAT WE FACE WHEN WE NEED HIS HELP...HE IS UP TO UP WHEN GIVING US THE HEADS UP TRUTH IN WHATEVER WE ARE FACING AND I AM THINKFUL AND GREATFUL FOR HIS LOVE AND RESPECT FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL EACH OF YOU THAT I HAVE FELT SECURE AND BELIEVE WHAT OPTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE...IN KNOWING WHAT REALITY THAT WE HAVE TO FACE...
DR. CHUNG GETS 5 STARS CAUSE ALL OF HIS STAFF ARE TRAINED AND PROFESSIONAL WITHOUT THE BEST OUT LOOK FOR US...IN ORDER FOR US TO SMILE ONCE AGAIN...
I WOULD RECOMMEND DR. CHUNG TO ANYONE IN THIS COUNTY OF VENTURA CALIFORNIA...
THANKS AGAIN...

Dr. Chung is the perfect dentist. He is very friendly and personable. His office staff likewise.  He has all the most modern and cutting-edge equipment. He takes the time to explain precisely what your teeth need and why.  He doesn’t hard-sell any of services, and if you do need major dental work, he explains whatever options are recommended for it and helps you decide what is best.  He also has financing available through an outside vendor offering very reasonable terms, for those lacking adequate insurance or cash-on-hand.  Dr. Chung does regular teeth cleaning more thoroughly than any other dentist I’ve ever seen, and does so surprisingly gently.  When I come in, there’s always so much plaque and tarter and general icky ness between my teeth that you can’t see where one ends and another begins, teeth lodged against each other so tightly they look like the stone blocks at Machu Picchu!  - But when he’s done with them, I can see the spaces between them again. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Chung for all your dental needs.  He cares about his patients and its genuine.  Other than that, he’s just a way rad kewel and bitchin’ dude!<//Text>

This is an amazing doctor. He has a sweet demeanor and is kind and is genuinely interested in how you are feeling and doing during treatment. I have been working with Dr Chung for over 2 yrs now and have personally seen the amazing doctor that he is and what a great chair side manner he has. I would highly recommend him to everyone that needs a dentist. Come in for an appointment or if you want to stop by to meet him first that is ok too. He is always available to shake your hand or give a hug. We accept PPO and HMO insurances and if you don’t have dental insurance we offer great payment plans. Call us today !!< /Text>

<user_id>108089040833253700409</user_id><review>This office is horrible. We were referred to Dr  Nguyen & located his new office. My 5yr old daughter has a deep cavity that was said to need anesthesia to fill. We were there waiting for 1hr 45mins until we walked out!!!! I had my 2yr old and my 5yr old.  They have nothing kid friendly for the kids & with wait times so long you can not expect kids to just sit and wait with nothing to do. Before we made our appt I asked how long I should plan for the appt to be, the receptionist said it shouldn't take too long as it was just a consultation and shouldn't take more than 45mins total. We were there for 1hr 45mins and still didn't see the dentist. I asked one of the ladies at about 1hr 30min into the waiting when we were going to be seen, my son needed his nap and daughter was hungry and had gymnastics class in 1hr. They said at least another 15-20mins more of waiting as there were 2 ppl in front of us. I was so frustrated. They said this is typically for him b/c he likes to take his time with his patients. I totally get that especially with kids but they totally OVER booked. I read great things about this doctor but didn't even get to meet him. Unfortunately we will not be going back,especially since they said this is typical wait time for this office. What a waste of almost 2 hours. Please do something about your scheduling and schedule LESS patience in a day... if it takes this long to see someone you are obviously are over booking and booking too close. Everyone was nice just didn't have there stuff together.<//review>< GmapID>

My cup running over about this Dentist. I was new to the area needed to find a new D.D.S and boy did I luck out! I couldn't be more pleased. Dr. Chung chair side mannerism surpasses any dental experience I have ever had, and I've had a few - good and bad. Dr Chung is very pacient, very caring, and very good at explaning everything. He simply melted my anxiety away over getting dental work done. The minute I walked into the office the staff there was welcoming, friendly, resourceful, and just a joy to chat with. I really like this place. This is my first time -ever- writing a review for a D.D.S., you gotta understand, I hated going to the dentist - Not anymore 😁 Thank you John W. Chung D.D.S. and your amazing staff.< /review>

< Review>
The employees here are not friendly and or people persons. I went in for a return and they said i needed my debit card and then gossip about me and my return like a pair of unprofessional teenage girls. Please act your age and professional.. you ladies are or at least look really old and you get paid to be helpful not rude.</Review>

<review>Juan the manager was great he not only help me out but went above and beyond. I bought a ratchet set weeks ago and it broke at the first use. I hadnt had the chance to be in the area to exchange it but today I was able to. He tried to help me as much as he could he helped me locate my purchase because I didnt have the receipt with me. He gave me a store credit and told me which set was the best. Thank you Juan 👍.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c3529c74f81c8b:0xc4ab95b47cff2ecc<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

Terrible customer service this worker went outside to check our battery and once he got done checking he goes its bad and walk back in the store. You are suppose to explain to us and offer to sell a battery not just walk away. I literally had to go back in store and get back in line when he could have easily helped us. Minding you the lines are long and slow. I always shop at auto zone but not ever again to this one.<//Review>

<review>A budget place for Auto parts but always get new parts and NOT rebuilt parts like a master cylinder. I went thru 3 of those and they all leaked. $500 dollars later at the dealer, they said the problem was installing rebuilt parts. So learn from me, avoid the high dealer costs and get NEW parts!!!< /review>< Time>

Terrible service and help. Will nevee shop there again. They gave me the wrong parts and when i tried to exchanged them they wouldn't take them back because I opened them. I had do open them and thats how I had to figure out that they didn't fit and not even a part to the make ans model of my vehicle. Instead od being treated like a loyal customer I was treated like I was trying to come up on them. Worthless. Never again.< /review>

< Review>
Clutch! My 14 Mazda3 S Grand Touring wouldn't start recently, had to get jumped a few times throughout the day so I got fed up and took it to my local autozone. They tested it, sure enough it was bad. Luckily I replaced the battery at autozone a couple years back in Rancho and before you know it, ASE certified Eric swapped the bad for a new good one at no charge and put some new wipers on in no time. Polite dude, professional guy and all around good experience tonight. Thanks E! ✌🏽😎<//Review>

So disappointed smh. Returned back to this store and the customer service is a joke again the workers fail to help customers who need help and pick people who simply walk up to the counter. I stood in line and they skipped me to help and charge one of their friends im so upset. This is the second time I have a horrible experience and I advise everyone to shop elsewhere for products.
Worst customer service in Rialto!<//Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>Pretty bad customer service, Got to the register and the guy just starred at me without saying a thing. so then I tell him the thing I'm looking for and he cuts me off and says "what car do you have" and I'm thinking...why the hell didn't he ask me that instead of just starring at me awkwardly for 20 seconds. The rest of the interaction was pretty bad as well. It seems like they hardly know anything about the parts either

I guess they assume that everyone knows the process you have to go through and they don't put in any effort to direct the flow of the interaction at all. I think ill be sticking to O'reilly's on Pepper Ave, they are much much better at customer interaction.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This Autozone store is the nearest to where I live. I am at this store spending money almost every weekend!! Sadly to say they have some of the worse customer service I've experienced. Most of the staff is not knowledgeable of the products they are selling or offering. The line at the parts counter and register are always backed up with angry costumers having to wait so long! Sometimes I try to avoid multiple trips here on one day because I know it might set me back at least an hour on the job I am working on. Sometimes employees take personal phone calls while helping costumers. The one thing I hate is when I see employees walking around on the "side-lines" seen the costumer back up they have yet they fail to give their fellow team members a hand. Not professional at all overall. Its sad because Autozone has great parts, prices, and have a highly advanced parts search engine compared to other parts stores. Yet this particular store doesn't reflect that. I feel sorry for the employees at this store that really do their job well.</Review>

I would honestly give no Stars to this place. There's a Hispanic man that works there(I don't remember his name)that acts like he doesn't speak or understand Spanish. He was rude towards Spanish speaking customers. Screaming "You don't speak English too or what!?! You want somebody that speaks Spanish!?!"  That's so unprofessional and embarrassing for those customers.<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) It was a fatal experience. The man who helped me was 45 years old and older, the Hispanic man treated me very badly, never turned to see me. I had to look for what I needed. I just do not go back and I can not put a star because they do not deserve it. . I own a business and do what I can to make the client feel at home. The worst experience of my life

They did a great job! Quick, efficient and polite. I got the full truckload and they took everything I wanted them to take. Less expensive than renting a dumpster and doing it myself<//Text>

<text>Junk King were so fast and easy to use. I expected to get voicemail and have to get a callback, but someone answered right away and got me to the right person for a quote. I was able to schedule a delivery for the very same day. They called to let me know when they were 20 minutes out, and were right on time. I am very impressed and happy with their service. 10/10 would highly recommend.<//text>< UserId.>

Called and got an appt the next day.  Very prompt.  Came during time I was given.  In and out for an extremely heavy old desk in 15 minutes.  Professional, friendly.  Service from scheduling appt to job completed was beyond my expectations.  Communication with main office was great!  Kept me up to date on everything.<//review>

Great job!   Got rid of an old washing machine stored in the garage a very large console TV and a treadmill along with miscellaneous electric devises.  Thank you so much. You made it so easy for me.  I was contacted before your arrival and two individuals removed all the items requested.  I will be using you again in my next spring cleaning day .</text>

Needed to get rid of my mattress. I hate lugging it anywhere- so I didn’t want to drag it down my stairs and into a car to make the trip somewhere. I found Junk King online. Every person I spoke with through call, text, and in person was polite, helpful, and communicative. Junk King employee arrived within the time frame I booked, grabbed my mattress, and left! Payment was easy too. It was hassle free and well worth my money. Thanks Junk King!</review>

I called on a Monday and was able to have someone come out on a Tuesday during a time that  accommodated my work schedule. The movers were courteous, polite, efficient, and professional. The cost was reasonable with several options for payment method.
I highly recommend Junk King-Fresno!< /review>

<Review>I ordered a new bed frame not thinking what I would do with my old box spring and metal frame. I looked at different options, but found Junk King had best prices and reviews.  When I called them a very nice lady named Christina answer the phone, walk me through the process, I chose a no-contact service. The two gentlemen that picked up the merchandise were quick  also very
professional. They called me before arriving, just like they said they would and after leaving.  Shortly after I got a call from Megan to receive payment via phone. Overall, very convenient, very pleasant experience, would 100% recommend them to anyone. My service was $75, and I booked them the day before at 4pm. They were here at 8:30am.  Combined  process time 30 minutes.< /Review>< Pictures>

All the employees I spoke to on the phone were polite and helpful, and the gentlemen who came to our home to pick up the furniture items were fast  in getting the job done, and were friendly. The whole experience with customer service performed by this company was refreshing - they do what they say they will do!< /Review>

I have used Junk King twice and have loved the service they provide. The entire process was so easy and hassle free. I was able to book online for a time that was convenient for me. The haulers were very professional. They were prompt, quick, efficient, and respectful. I will use Junk King again in the future.< /Text>

I was calling for estimates for an appliance removal.  My first call to another company was answered by a grumpy voice. My second call was to Junk King, and I was kindly greeted by Meghan.  The estimate was reasonable, but it was Meghan that sealed the deal.
This company is highly recommended.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

The crew had shown up to the residence earlier than scheduled.  They arrived around 11:15am when the schedule time was from 1pm - 3pm.  I called multiple times to ask the crew to return but did not receive status until my 3rd call to the central number.  The rep (Alicia?) was able to secure time the following day.  The crew called and showed up around 10am vs. the 1pm - 3pm scheduled time.  The crew said that sometimes their schedule changes.  If a crew would be arriving earlier than the scheduled time, it would be good to advise customers that this could happen either on the website or when I scheduled the pick-up.< /Text>

The company removed my spa. Anthony and his team member did a great job. No damage to anything. The guys were polite and professional. They finished within an hour and hauled everything away. Highly recommend this company.< /Text>

<review>2 men came on time, were very polite and courteous. They gave me my quote which was very reasonable, gave me a $20 discount for booking online and then were  just awesome and knocked the price down by another $30. They removed everything in about 10 minutes and I was able to pay with a debit card. I would definitely use them again.< /review>< username>

We’ve been collecting things that needed to go to the dump for too long and with three little kids at home and no truck, we finally realized that hiring someone to do the job was completely worth it— and it is! This is not the cheapest way to get rid of your junk, but money well spent. We should’ve done it sooner! Booking was so simple and the guys came right when we needed them. They were quick and courteous.< /Text>

<Review>My daughters cleaned out my garage & set up appointment with Junk King. Initial contact was very professional, pleasant, & reassuring for me. The men who cleaned up were great: courteous & pleasant. I can’t express how quick & efficient this service was. I will most definitely return to them when needed.

<Review>The price was good, $98 for removal of queen mattress and queen bed box spring frame. Additional $20 off for booking online. A star taken off for removal. Although the removers were in and out quickly, I did not receive a phone call letting me know they were 15 minutes away. Instead the call was to let me know they were here at the gate. Good service overall, will use again.< /Review><gmapID>0x80945eaca3d25b47:0x48a4a48f26cbffd1</gmapID></record>

<Text>I couldn't be happier with Junk King. Wes and crew resolved a problem that I'd been avoiding for 15 years. They removed an ancient swimming pool filter--a large steel tank filled with sand and gravel--that was in a position that couldn't be reached by a crane and was surrounded by newer pool equipment. Wes took on the challenge and resolved the issue to my total satisfaction!  And at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend Junk King and would definitely use them again.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

We had a ton of branches and foliage needing picked up around our yard; after trimming several trees. Junk King’s came and removed all of it in one load! (we thought it may take more than one) The two gentlemen who came to our home worked quickly, efficiently, and excellently. Both were kind and did their best to fit all of our “junk”  in one load, keeping our cost down. I was truly grateful for their service, and highly recommend this company!< /Text>

On-time and quick removal of all items we asked. I would have appreciated if they had informed me that there would have been an extra cost for large appliances like washers, dryers and small freezers but it does make sense why the extra charge. Overall I was pleased with the work.< /Text>

Junk Kings was AMAZING! They came out quickly and were able to get my hot tub taken away! I feel like a 500lb weight has been lifted from my shoulders (or at least my yard)! Thank you for your friendly service, it was a pleasure!</Text>

JUNG KING WAS AWESOME! I set up an appointment time online which was a two hour window and said they’d call me on the day of my appointment, 20 mins before arriving to my house to let me know they’re coming. They came and took my two large couches within 5 minutes. So fast, efficient, and friendly. Will definitely them again for furniture/ junk removal.  Thanks again guys, it was a pleasure!

P.S. It was $50 cheaper than what I expected to pay.< /Text>

<Review>I contacted JunkKings via their website the night before in order to have a cal king mattress and some box springs removed from my home. Not only did these guys show up, professionally remove my furniture (while following COVID guidelines), they chose to give me a courtesy call 4 hours prior to our scheduled time to inform me that they could come by earlier if it was okay with me. By far exceeded my expectations, thank you Junk Kings. I highly recommend this business for the removal of your junk.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I was able to book the pickup for my used over-the-range microwave on a Sunday. They were all booked up for Monday but came out to my condominium on Tuesday morning. I had it packed up in the shipping carton the new microwave came in. It was ready for the two man crew in the parking lot. I was waiting for them at the front gate and let them in with my clicker. They were right on time and I paid the negotiated fee by CC over the phone to a staff person. “Fast, efficient, and friendly” is my satisfaction summary.< /Text><Response>None<//Response>< user>

<text>The people answering the phones were especially nice and very helpful. There were some challenges for the drivers so the time window was not kept, but the rescheduled drivers the next day called to keep me informed of their estimated arrival. They were very courteous and respectful of my property while achieving the task at hand. Even with the one unfortunate circumstance, overall they made it right and provided quality service and a reasonable price.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80945eaca3d25b47:0x48a4a48f26cbffd1<//gmapID></record>

<text>We had the best experience with Junk King today. They hauled our hot tub out for us on short notice. I really wish I got their names, but the two gentlemen who did the job were very kind and professional with great customer service. I really appreciated them offering to take more of our junk that was lying around. I would definitely recommend this business!</text>< Pics>

Quick and easy! I called yesterday to set up appointment for this morning. They called 20 minutes out. Upon arrival they assessed my junk and gave me a quote for its removal. I was happy with the quote and they loaded up my junk and took it away. Couldn’t be happier with this service!</Text>

They were in and out in 5 minutes (all I had was a mattress and box spring) and very friendly! I would highly recommend this service.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>The appointment process was quick and easy. The guys came right in time, and called 20 minutes before they arrived.
They were professional and very kind.  They gave us a quote, and loaded things up quickly.
I would say that the end price was quite a bit more than I wanted to spend, but the fact that they came out for the free estimate with not obligation made me WANT to use their service. I probably paid $50 more than I wanted to, buy oh well. They were very nice guys. I would use them again, despite the price.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I set up my pick up on their website the night before, love how easy that was. I set a time window of 10-12.

They called and gave me a time estimate from their GPS when they were on their way, and they were here and done before 12.

They found my place easily, three men came up, got my mattress and box spring out the door super fast. All friendly, and the one who seemed to be the lead of the group shook my hand after I handed him the check. (I’m a woman and I notice when men treat me with business respect). They take cash, check, and credit.

It was $98 for removal of a queen mattress and box spring. Was I supposed to tip? I didn’t, and now I’m not sure. Gah! Someone let me know what’s the standard for next time please?

Definitely recommend.</Review><user_name>Charlie Moore< /user_name>< GmapID>

I requested a quote through the Yelp messages feature on the Junk King Fresno page and they replied within minutes. After a few messages about details of the what I needed removed they gave me a quote. Two days later, two gentlemen showed up within the quoted timeframe and removed our items. They were quick and professional. I would recommend them to family and friends.< /Text>

<text>From start to finish I highly recommend this company! From the beginning on figuring out price, which Manny was great to talk to. The drivers that came were very nice and respectful. And then paying by card was easy. Again I highly recommend this company. I called 2 others before Junk King and Junk King stood out the most to me.</text>< pics>

Moving my mother out of her apartment in with me was already and emotional and exhausting time . Having them come in and remove the things during COVID 19 that I did not know what to do with, was an awesome feeling. I am forever grateful for them coming in and literally taking this load off my hands.<//text>

Worked like clockwork which is what I like. Scheduled the appointment online and they called me 30 minutes before my service window opened which was great! They even let me add 1 item to my pick up order. Everything was done and taken care in less than 15 minutes. Junk companies can be expensive because they have a lot of bills to pay themselves so if you complain about $238 being high to dispose of a couch, old 16-17yr old 1080i tube TV and a power recliner with a lift then good luck finding an easier way to dispose of your stuff. I will do business with this company again.< /Text>

<Review>The service was excellent and Michael was extremely polite!  The boys worked quickly and got everything loaded and cleaned up.  It was less expensive for me to use Junk King than it would be to order a bin and do it myself.  I will definitely use Junk King again and highly recommend their service.

This is a great company. The were
more than prompt. The price was a bargain. My usual trash pickup was cancelled and my curb was full. The city wanted me to take the trash and put it back in the yard. I was very happy with the professional way my request was handeled. I will definitly call them again.<//review>

Great communication, fast response to my initial inquiry and the gentlemen that showed up were professional, friendly, cognizant of surrounding objects to be careful of while in the process of removing our item. Good experience!<//review>

They picked up 2 queen size mattresses which I paid 158 dollars for pick up and then the next day I saw one of my mattresses on the side of the freeway. It must of blown out of their truck. They should of secured it in their truck. I let them know but I haven’t received a response.< /Text>

The fact that they are insured, bonded, and licensed which are all very important (none of the others I checked had these).  The people who assisted were professional and friendly.  They were quick in getting the job done.  The pricing is not exorbitant.  It is just about where it should be.  Will definitely recommend.<//Text>

The team from Junk King cleaned up and hauled off a pile of debris that filled up there truck to the max for a very reasonable price which was cheaper than me renting a roll off container and having to load it myself.
Would highly recommend Junk King for your next clean up project.
Thanks again Junk King ,
Scot.</Text>

< Review>
The team that came to my home were professional and very efficient. I was very impressed at how they communicated with each other, they were organized and when the truck was loaded they cleaned up the area very neatly and thoroughly.  I was as if they were never parked there. This is my second time using Junk King.  I would highly recommend them. Thank you Junk King.</Review>

I recently bought a fixer upper property that was literally waist deep in junk. I called Junk King and they came the same day and removed 9000 pounds of garbage/furniture/appliances/etc. The staff was professional and friendly and the price was very fair. I highly recommend Junk King! 5 STARS!!!</Review>

Really close to on time - delayed by long line at the dump.  Took 2 hours to accomplish what it would have taken me 3 days+.  Highly recommend especially if you get Michael as one of the drivers.  Michael and his sidekick worked their rears off.  Made me tired just watching them.  Once again HIGHLY RECOMMEND - would give them 10 stars if that were an option.</Review>

I had Junk King remove an old refrigerator. I set up the appointment online and was able to text then a picture of the refrigerator. They arrived on time and were extremely polite. The only little hiccup was the price. I sent a picture of the refrigerator to be removed and received a price of $98 to remove. When they arrived, I was told it would be $108.  It wasn’t a difficult item to move so I was a bit surprised by the extra cost.</Text>

Isaiah showed up three minutes early. He was patient and so careful with my things as he helped me sort junk from important pieces. He made it easy to plow through two intimidating storage units in a short time and with no stress. I have a lot more to get rid of and there is no doubt that I will call Junk King. I’ll also recommend their services to anyone who asks. Five stars AND thumbs up!<//review>

<text>While they made the 10 AM to Noon window by about 30 seconds, the first call I got was at 9:30 AM saying they’d be there in 25 minutes. From there it was a string of calls saying just 20 more minutes.

Once they got there though, they were professional, respectful, and fast.< /text>< Pics>

Really enjoyed the guys picking up (Mike and crew).  They were friendly, efficient, clean, and kept professional demeanor. They even cleaned up after it was all done. In addition, they were quite fair with the add-ons I had after the initial bid. I would definitely use they again if needed.</review>

I’m very satisfied with the service. We had about 1.5 truck loads worth of trash that needed to be taken away after a four day party at home. Two guys showed up after giving us a 20 minutes warning through call. They got all the trash out in about 10 minutes. They were very professional.< /Text>

Company is great! We had to empty a house that was a total disaster. Pricing was very competitive. The guys that came out were on time, honest, friendly, and fast! They even questioned some items they thought could be of importance before just tossing them. I would recommend them for any size job. We are remodeling our house and I will be calling them again.< /Review>

These guys that came today did a great job!  I was happy finally after 3 appts that it could be completed! The first appt I was told that the estimate and haul away would happen. Only the estimate happened so another appt was made but no one said it had to be disconnected so the third appt it was finally done after I had someone out to disconnect! I was very disappointed! Today these guys were great!! I feel I should have had a discount for all the times I waited and the inconvenience!<//Text>

The whole crew was very friendly and respectful.  They kept me updated about their arrival time, they loaded up a full truck & cleaned up the area in half the time I thought it would take them.  The time and cost savings were awesome for the price.  I would have spend many hours and truck load trips to do it on my own.

Awesome service, quote was reasonable and easy (just text a pic of items needing pickup!) and service men were on time  for pickup appointment - what more could you ask for?
Recommend you combine pickup w a neighbor if you don't have much to pick up, since there is a minimum pickup fee. Very pleased!</Text>

We always strive to take care of each and every one of our customers and leave them smiling when our job is completed. To clarify, 0 of the reviews have been paid for. They are all genuine and from customers that have used Junk-King’s service. We filled each Junk-King truck to full capacity and showed you it was full before leaving the job site. We attempted to accommodate you and your husband’s requests as much as possible. By your review, it’s apparent you feel we came up short and I apologize for that. If there is anything I can do to assist you please let me know. You can reach me through our company phone number at 559-205-7118.\n\nThank you,\nWes Burgess\nOwner\nJunk-King'}< /resp>

< review>
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Their high reviews must have been bought. Companies do that. This is a horribly run company. They do not have the equipment needed to do the job properly. If you hire them, the first thing you'll discover is that they over book all their jobs. So they will be several hours late getting to your job and will not take the time needed to do your job because they need to go to the next one. The guys that come to do the job are great. I had Mike and Zaite. Great guys but they have to do everything by hand which puts them at great risk and takes a long time. Since they have to do it all by hand and are constantly running behind, they can't/don't/won't load the truck in an efficient manner. You will pay for a full load when the truck could have easily held twice as much. So that is a little scam they run. Since they won't get your whole load in, they sell you another work day. So you end up paying twice as much as you should have if loaded properly. If they quote you $500, be fully prepared to pay $1000 to actually get it  done.They wanted to take 3 days to do what a proper hauling company did in one day for me. (See pictures in my review for Kevin Moya Junk Hauling in Visalia). This clown Isaiah that runs that Fresno location of Junk King is the one that double books these boys. I had furniture as well as yard waste. These guys have to try to bust up stuff by hand. It's rediculous. If you like to waste a lot of money and spend several days to get your stuff hauled, this is the company for you. Katie Smith in Lemon Cove< /review>

I had an estimate of $800 to remove to gardening trailers with some green waste and to golf carts when your guys showed up they said they would be back in a few days to remove the two trailers they took some green waste and some boards out of each one of the gardening trailers they left in the meantime I found someone to haul those trailers off there was still green waste and
boards in  left on them I called someone at your office told her I didn't need them to come back and take the two two trailers  that person told me I had to pay $400 just for the little green waste and boards that they removed I'm very unhappy I don't think I should be charged $400 since your estimate was $800 for the two trailers what was inside them and the two golf carts the two golf carts are still here so plz I don't mind paying I feel that that $400 is way too much thank you for your time</review>
