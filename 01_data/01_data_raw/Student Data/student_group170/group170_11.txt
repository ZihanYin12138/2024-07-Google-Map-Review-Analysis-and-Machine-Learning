Hands down the best dealership experience I've ever had. Staff was friendly and helpful, with a very relaxed atmosphere overall that made me very comfortable. They weren't pushy or spouting stuff to try to force a sale. Stephanie, our saleswoman, was delightful and engaging. I came home with a fabulous car and a very satisfying experience.<//Text>

Extremely satisfied with my experience from beginning to end with these guys. Sam was a joy to work with, he was super patient with my indecision and multitude of questions. He took the time to listen to what I was looking for and really helped me in getting there at a very fair price and terms. Brett was a great help as well. Highly recommend this spot and Sam if you’re looking for a new car!

This is my first mini and absolutely loving it, I can’t see myself going to any other brand until I get a Tesla.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Before buying our 2022 electric Mini, we compared many of the SoCal Mini dealerships. We settled on Mini of Santa Monic thanks to Sam Markovich's excellent sales efforts, and we're very happy that we did. Today we returned to Mini of Santa Monica for what is called something like a "second visit," where an expert technician goes over any questions about any of the car's features and equipment that may not be clear. We met with Anita, who did a just stellar job of addressing our long list of outstanding questions, and thanks to her knowledge and patience, we left with a much better acquaintance with our wonderful new car.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>“ Great experience from start to finish. ”
The minute we walked into the Mini Cooper Dealership in Santa Monica we were greeted by Anita Lee.  I was debating on what vehicle to select and she was very knowledgeable of what the cars each had to offer. Anita kept me informed of progress and helped answer any questions I had. From selection to signing paperwork, it was a very smooth process. I will be back and I will refer my friends here. Extraordinary job!</review>< Pics>

<Text>I had the timely opportunity to rent a Mini Countryman and I fell in love and had to get one. I am very lucky that both Sam and Stephanie could commiserate and my friend and I spent a very informative day with them resulting in a fair and transparent trade in and a new Countryman!! They were professional, fun and very much willing to answer any and all questions and concerns. I felt very much taken care of and never left in the dark during our pricing, etc. discussions. If you are in the market for a MINI (which I recommend!) this is the place to come as the staff are wonderful!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I cannot say enough wonderful things about my experience with Nikki, Charles, and Dean at Mini Santa Monica.

I came in because I wanted a mini convertible. I've had Toyotas my entire life, and was ready for an upgrade!

The process was seamless and the facilities are clean and chic. Everything was so quick, and I felt like I was in wonderful hands there. Thank you Nikki, Charles, and Dean!!!!!!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rating>

< Review>
This is my first and only Google review, which should be a ZERO.

I've been a MINI loyalist since 2016 and have had incredible service from MINI dealers in three other states until attempting to lease a vehicle from MINI Santa Monica.  I was talking with Sam in Sales for a couple weeks about finding and leasing a vehicle in what should have been a straight-forward transaction with very little guess work.  I was in the process of relocating and splitting my time between two locations and unfortunately could not meet in person, which of course is ideal.

Nevertheless, Sam set the expectation that the dealer would run my financing, make me an offer and, if agreed, I would come to the dealer to sign paperwork as soon as I could, which was in 5 days.  He arrogantly proclaimed, "I've put vehicles on hold for people for up to 2 weeks; it's no problem at all."  He also promised he would FedEx my lease paperwork due to the long distance so I anticipated the hard part would be over before I arrived to the dealer to pick up my vehicle in 5 days ... WRONG.

Sam sent me an application via email and when I decided on a vehicle, I returned my completed application with a copy of my drivers license PER HIS REQUEST.  I waited almost 5 hours before calling the dealership back trying to track down Sam and ask for status on his promises.  Nothing but the run-around from other staff and direct to his voicemail.

Why on Earth would a car salesman dodge a buyer's phone calls??

After getting a sudden cold shoulder from Sam after submitting my application, I left an urgent message with Seth, the Sales manager, stating it was almost the end of the day on a Friday before a holiday weekend and MINI Financial Services was already closed for consumers. I mean, who wants to drag out car buying any longer than absolutely necessary? Sam then FINALLY returned my call and ACTED LIKE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON.

He reneged on running my electronic credit application, which made it completely unethical for him to ask for it in the first place.  He reneged on holding the vehicle until I could physically be at the dealer to sign paperwork.  Not only did he renege on every single promise, he became UNHINGED when I held him accountable.  He literally began SCREAMING at me like it was a domestic dispute.  He went from professional and accommodating to taking everything personally and becoming abusive toward me when his gaslighting tactics didn't work.

Sadly, when I asked Seth to step in, it was more chauvinistic behavior, an outright denial of wrong-doing, and a blatant refusal to make this process seamless for me in any way possible.  He even called me by another woman's name ... WHO IS ELIZABETH??  I later received a half-a$$ apology from Seth followed by, "Can we just move on?," without even letting me express my concerns.  I had to rearrange my busy holiday weekend to ACCOMODATE THEM.  I was lured, baited, switched, then swiftly discarded even when I held my end of the deal, which ultimately led to a complete violation of my privacy and unethical business practices.  If the dealer asserts one cannot purchase a vehicle electronically in CA, then stop asking for personal information like SSN and drivers license VIA EMAIL and making fake promises to "see if the customer is committed" then not follow through with the sale.

The way these guys talk to women and people of color is absolutely horrific.  Clearly the promises that were broken for me were previously honored for "other customers."  While I still love the MINI brand, I will never forget this humiliating experience as long as I live and will never return to or recommend this dealer.</Review>

I was thrown into the car buying market when the car I had owned for many years was totaled in an accident. I was considering a few brands and had already looked at a couple when I walked into Mini Of Santa Monica. I was instantly impressed by the beautiful and spotless showroom and warm and friendly staff who made me feel welcome! I had the absolute pleasure of meeting Anita, who was friendly, knowledgeable, informative, helpful and just a real kick in the pants! As soon as she took me downstairs to see some additional cars, to sit in them, and to explain some of the features, my decision was made! It was a Mini for me! Anita’s follow-up and customer service skills throughout the process were exemplary and she was an utter joy to work with! Sam was also a delight! Super friendly, and most helpful in answering some of my questions! Seth, the General Sales Manager, was most kind, helpful and eager to please! He answered all of my additional questions and put forth a valiant effort in finding the exact car that would meet my desire! ...And then there was Dean, the General Manager. I don’t know how he did it but he actually located the exact car of my dreams (color, trim package, etc) and he was able to get it for me within a few days! He also made the final paperwork and payment process quick, easy, and painless! When I tried to express my profuse gratitude to him, he simply (and very humbly) said, “Well this is what we do.” Wow! A lovely man and a very special person! I picked up my new Mini yesterday, at which point Anita helped me connect my iPhone to it and ran through all of the features with me! I couldn’t be more excited and the icing on the cake is that they all genuinely shared in my joy and excitement! I can’t say enough about Mini Of Santa Monica (obviously, I’m rambling!) and I would highly recommend them! From the bottom of my heart, thank you to all of you!!<//Text>

I want to shout out Mini of Santa Monica for their incredibly helpful and kind service. My old 2012 mini got totaled while it was parked and had to scramble to find a new one. I was really hoping to get a honda or a toyota really hoping to keep cost of repairs down...but once I've driven a mini I just couldn't.
Stephanie was so calm, so kind, and helpful. Her vibe really helped me be less overwhelmed by the whole process since it was my first time.
Dean helped me sign the deal and figure out loan stuff which was amazing because I was so new to all of it!
Also, Bryan in service was ON IT!!
I highly highly recommend Mini of Santa Monica to buy a car. They've got great deals, great people, and a great ocean breeze!</review>

I want to thank MINI of SM for their great service and honesty. When my car's brake light was on during COVID-19, Mini of SM was closed so I decided to go to another MINI dealership and they wanted to charge me a super unreasonable price, they wanted to charge me this charge that, I know they were being dishonest so I called Mini SM, luckily they are opened, they did inspection on my car, and it turns out that my car didn't need more service. Then I told the other Mini dealership about that, they offered to decrease $300 immediately to go back to them, I will never go back to that dealership. Brain did a great job, he's very professional, dedicated to his work. Richard is super nice and he's professional at customer service. Great experience!<//review>

I had a really wonderful purchase experience at Mini of Santa Monica. I was in a bit of an odd position trying to purchase a car while moving cross country from NYC to SoCal. I reached out to several dealerships trying to get  the process started remotely and the majority of them completely brushed me off.

However! Mauricio at Santa Monica, found me the perfect Mini for my budget and worked really hard to get all the paperwork done remotely. He was proactive, responsive, and made the process completely painless. By the time I landed in California my Mini was ready to go! I picked it up, he kindly showed me all the bells and whistles and I was on my way. Now I'm zipping around in my dream car!

Couldn't ask for better service!< /Review>

<Review>Extremely rude, to the point of bullying. No flexibility in helping the customer find the car they are looking for that actually  meets their need and budget, instead  this dealer and it’s manager only think about their profit. We had  at most been looking to buy a mini for 2 weeks, we inquired online the prices were so off and expensive we decided to look elsewhere and everyday these from mini of Santa Monica would call us to the point of harassment to come make a deal, when we got their and realized we didn’t like the car they gave us attitude and were not open to help us find a better car and the manger and sales associate Cindy were irate at why we “changed the car on them” worst experience. Beware of the manger and sales person Cindy, they are sneaky, rude and have attitudes. The manger uses outdated sales techniques and guilt psychology to try to coax you into buying a car with them. Do not buy your car from here! Cindy seems like she needs a couple weeks of rest, she is worn out, without patience and has major attitude issues.<//Review>< date>

I had a great experience working with Mauricio Ortega to buy my electric MINI last week.  He was both super knowledgeable and genuinely friendly,  while efficiently facilitating the paperwork to get us on our way.  Thank you, Mauricio!

Having just moved back to CA from overseas, my family and I were in need of a car quickly. I contacted MINI of Santa Monica and was immediately introduced to Mike. Mike was extremely knowledgeable and professional; he showed me every car I asked about. He had no hidden agenda - he was simply there to help, answering all questions with thoughtful and detailed answers. I told Mike I'd discuss the options with my wife and Mike NEVER asked for my phone number or email before I left the dealership. This, in itself, was incredibly telling as every other dealership I'd been to had jumped me for my personal details as if I had the word "lead" tattooed to my forehead. I called Mike the next day and unfortunately he was out sick. Instead of asking if I could come in a day or two later, he put me in immediate contact with Rich, who Mike said was "equally or even more knowledgeable about Minis than I am." Sure enough, when I met with Rich that day, he had the same professional and low key manner. Like Mike, he was most interested in making sure my questions were answered, and less interested in whether or not I purchased a vehicle from him. And like Mike, he loves these cars - so everything he showed me felt extremely personal to him. At the risk of sounding overly corny, it was like Rich owned Mini, the company, and was proud of what he'd created. Needless to say, within two hours of walking in, I was driving away in my new car. The next day I received an excited call from Rich, asking me about my drive back to Malibu in my new Mini. You see, I had never requested a test drive which says it all....<//Text>

Just sold my 2016 mini last week and it was an great experience. Their appraisal value is much higher than Carmax. Art Echeverria came a few minutes earlier than the scheduled appointment and we did the paperworks and that was it. I'm just wating for the $100 amazon referal from them. Highly recommended.</Review>

Recently worked with Sam M to find a mini, and though we didn’t end up getting one in the end, our experience w him was phenomenal. Very down-to-earth and never felt salesy - he put up graciously and kindly with our evolving opinion and gave us a very honest and great service. Really wish the stars had aligned for us to have given him our business - ask for him if you’re ever interested in a mini!<//Review>

<user>106152174048774413075< /user><Review>Was in Santa Monica for a couple of days to help my daughter lease a new car.  We were looking at various makes, and last minute stopped in at Mini of Santa Monica as driving past.  Sam Markovich, helped us and within a couple of hours, we ended up purchasing a used Mini with low miles at a rate comparable to a lease.  Sam was very helpful and worked with us to figure out something that would fit her budget as a new college grad.  Highly recommend them - something don't often say about dealerships!</Review></record>

I was in the market for a 4-door MINI and searching everywhere. My MINI 2-door had been being serviced by MINI of Santa Monica for the past two years and I have always been a huge fan of the people who work there. I found some great deals on 4-doors but I really wanted to give my business to Santa Monica. Mauricio called me and they had the perfect car! Yes, a tiny bit out of my price range but so worth it! The MINI is absolutely incredible and I couldn't be happier; however, beyond that,
the entire experience of working with Mauricio made it that much more awesome. From start to finish he was so genuine, friendly, thoughtful, and really invested in what I was looking for and what my budget could handle. Plus, he makes an amazing hot chocolate! Everyone at MINI Cooper of Santa Monica is top notch! It's a wonderful environment and definitely THE place to go if you are shopping for a new and/or pre-owned vehicle. If you didn't want a MINI before, you will once you visit MINI of SM! I am so grateful to Mauricio and the MINI Cooper team!<//Text>

<Review>A big shout out to Rich of Mini of Santa Monica for making my car buying experience super delightful. Up until I met Rich, I had been "car shopping" for two years...TWO! He was so helpful and responsive - answered all my questions (even the ridiculous ones) and helped me through the entire process of buying a new car and then some. With Rich invovled, the process went from daunting to enjoyable! The rest of the team at Mini was great, such a sense of community and I am happy to be a part of it! Highly recommend Rich and this dealership.</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I couldn't have had a more positive experience selecting and leasing my new MINI than I did at MINI of Santa Monica, largely due to my incredibly personable and refreshingly straightforward salesman, Mauricio Ortega. Mauricio was an absolute pleasure to deal with from the moment I walked in to the moment I drove away in my awesome 2019 Starlight Blue MINI. I've never met a car salesman I liked so much -- Mauricio is smart, caring and interested in making sure his customers are happy. He never uses any of the high-pressure techniques car salesmen are notorious for, and talking with him felt like having a conversation with a friend. After he patiently showed me the cars in the dealership and went through my options with me, he found the exact car I was looking for (which was not at the dealership -- he actually found me two options, a 2019 and a 2020) and even called me on his day off to let me know the car was mine. This exemplifies the kind of attentive service that goes above and beyond that I got from Mauricio at every step of the process. When it was time to negotiate and sign my lease, Mauricio didn't subject me to the typical back and forth but went straight to the best offer, which was actually hard to believe. This is my third MINI but my first time at MINI of Santa Monica, and the first time I enjoyed the process of getting the car as much as driving it.<//Review>

I took my car in July to get my entertainment console inspected, and ask why my steering wheel was peeling. They did not write what was the appointment was for, and when I got there, I had to pay a lift to come back home and back, as they had to keep the car and they did not have a rental.
They told me they will call me by the end of the week( it was Tuesday) to get the new parts installed, but they never called. Today is October and I am still waiting for them to call me. I also spoke with someone in the dealer to talk to the GM, and it has been 3 days and I am still waiting. Brian the service advisor dropped the ball, but the whole dealer did.  Almost 4 months waiting for a call back!!

e service advisor dropped the ball, but the whole dealer did.  Almost 4 months waiting for a call back!!

Update; they tell you here in yelp they will help, they tell you on the phone the GM will call, but no help when you call the dealer, they tell you to wait even more. the GM still has not called. My husband called the dealer yesterday, neither the service Manager or Brian was there and told him to wait until Tuesday for someone to be able to help. So no one in the dealer is willing and able to help with a customer that has been waiting for 4 months for a repair. This dealership does not care about the customers. The team is not accountable for their jobs, the GM does not get involved, to me that shows poor management reflecting to the bottom. SO SO DISAPPOINTED. This was my first Mini and you are making me regret my decision! I have received outstanding service service from Audi and VW before, yeah, for sure they have made mistakes, but the way they care to fix it and make sure you are satisfied, is what make me respect them and value them again....no wonder why Audi and VW lead the market<//Review>

Rip off in  the service dept!   my new car under warranty wouldn't start all of a sudden because of a bad battery. I took the vehicle in for service to replace the battery and they refused to replace a battey that was under warranty and gave me a awfully BOGUS reason why my warranty wouldn't cover my battery. I contacted another dealership and was told that the batteries for my year vehicle have been faulty. The service manager still charged me for a battery, and refused to offer good customer service.. Honestly would give 0 stars ...

He also began asking questions about how I purchased vehicle, and how he did a history check on my vehicle. WHY?  I AM only here for a battery that should have been covered under warranty!<//text>

Regarding the coverage of your battery; it appears the diagnostic reading indicated the ignition switch (auxiliary power) was left on, causing battery drain. Unfortunately, this caused the repairs to be ineligible for coverage according to MINI's warranty guidelines. However, our service department always attempts to cover some of the costs associated with repairs when warranty has declined coverage.

Service above and beyond!  I hemmed and hawed over getting a Mini for years.  Finally got one and less than 2 weeks later, had an unlucky break with a bad tire.  Their service manager Bob went above and beyond to take care of me and the crew got me out the same day.  I'm loving my car but Mini of Santa Monica has earned my loyalty for all service trips and my next Mini!  Thanks again!<//Review>

We had a great car-buying experience at Mini Santa Monica. Sam, our salesman, was very knowledgeable and helpful at every step of the process. He even recommended a great nearby café for us to get a snack and kill some time while we waited for paperwork to process. The finance team reps we worked with were also friendly and on-point. As a nice bonus, the owners are very dog-friendly, so we got some treats and a Mini-branded dog-bag dispenser. Overall, the people and perks and Mini SanMo make, what would be a stressful experience, fun and memorable.< /text>

<review>I was on the fence about getting another Mini due to some bad experiences with another dealership. But, I was so happy when this dealership opened in Santa Monica and I never looked back at the other one.

Mauricio helped me out with the lease end process, and found me another comparable Mini.  I prefer manual transmission, so not easy to find. He ended up picking it up from another dealer in Calabasas and drove it down - in traffic! Now that's amazing. Not to mention, he's great to work with and made everything very simple.

Everyone I have interacted with from finance to service have been so nice, and really helped change my experience with Mini Cooper. Which is a win for me because I love driving them!<//review>< Pics>

<text>I grew up in the Southern California area and later in life, I moved to San Antonio, Texas where I eventually purchased my first Mini at Mini of San Antonio. I absolutely loved the car (a 2012 Clubman S), but after a while, I found myself moving back to California and in making the move, I reluctantly made the decision to sell the Mini (less stuff to bring back with me). Fast forward about six years later, and I find myself in California engaged to a girl who I had a major crush on in college (thank you, Facebook). My fiancée was recently in the market for a car, and I couldn’t help but mention how cool the Mini line is. Since we live in the Culver City area, we decided to take a ride over to Mini of Santa Monica “just to have a look.” We were greeted by and eventually established a contact with a salesman named Mauricio. Mauricio is fantastic, by the way! We had informed him of my 2012 Mini, and Mauricio took over from that point filling us in on all the performance and technological developments that have evolved through the Mini brand over the past several years. We felt relaxed, we felt informed and we felt confident, all without any sales pressure. Mauricio really made the entire experience a very positive one. We didn’t buy on that day, but we left our name and number because we’re we’re actually shopping other makers as well. Our search wasn’t really going anywhere, but we kept thinking about a Mini. Mauricio would call and text every so often to let us know that he was available should we have questions and/or second thoughts. This all in a very subtle and non-invasive manner. Mauricio had been such a pleasure to deal with that we decided finally to take one more look to see if we could maybe find a fit in a Mini. We saw Mauricio again at the dealership, still as helpful and charming as ever. We combed through some inventory downstairs, and we stumbled across a 2017, certified pre-owned Clubman S Black with Black wheels with just about 10,000 miles on the odometer. We took a test drive and that sealed the deal. We love the car, we love the dealership and we thoroughly enjoyed our buying experience made possible by Mauricio. A great all around experience; two thumbs up! Happy Motoring! 😃<//text>< date>

< review>
All service chargers are over the top. And wait time was long even though supposedly i had an appointment. Also, paid to have keys made and they never even called me to let me know they were ready. Waited nearly two weeks and then when I call, i was put on hold for almost 20 minutes just to be told...”oh yeah, they are ready.” Great, but guys you were supposed to call me. Terrible customer service, while they brag on their website about the opposite being true.</review>

Worst Experience. Go to Firestone, Midas, or anywhere else.

Booked an 8:30 AM appointment. Was told that I just needed an oil change, air filter replaced, and tires rotated. They told me to come back at 12:00 PM and that the service would be ~$427.

My brother owns 8 car dealerships back east. I relayed this information to him and he said that’s absolutely ridiculous. He said that type of service should only take 1 hour and should be half the price. Dealers have high service prices because it’s where they have the best margin and make most of their money. Also, rotating tires should be a free service as a courtesy.

I was already there and just wanted the car serviced so I just went with it. By 1:00 PM, I still had not received a call that my car was done. I called to ask why and they said they’d been swamped and hadn’t gotten to my car yet. They told me they’d maybe have it by the end of the day but weren’t sure. In short, they literally just forgot to service my car…

I said this was ridiculous and wanted my car back. When I got there, they conveniently said that I was up next. I said no and took my car elsewhere.

I had my service done at Firestone on Lincoln Blvd. They did all of this for me in less than an hour, FOR $68 and the tire rotation was free as a courtesy. They also found my rear light wasn't working, and fixed it FOR FREE.

DO NOT GET YOU CAR SERVICED HERE. They will try to overcharge you and then forget to even service your car.

Worst experience.</text>

<Response>{'time': 1536601926694, 'text': "Hi Zac,\n\nI am sorry to hear you had a less than enjoyable experience. I looked into the charges associated with your work order acknowledgement as to ensure that there wasn't any discrepancies. To clarify, the oil service was $79.95, Brake Fluid flush $169, Tire rotation $39, as well there was a diagnostic charge of $129 regarding a cracked driver side tail light concern. With every work order we also complete a complimentary multi point inspection to provide customers with our recommendation for necessary or future services.  As a brick and mortar business, we have no intention of price gauging customers or over charging, as it doesn't serve us any benefit, being in the retail business. Our prices, though high, are competitive to the Santa Monica area, and are what enable us to provide auxiliary services to our customer base.\n\nHowever, I did address the issue of the promise time with my service team, and though the work order states 5:00pm, clearly our advisor was negligent in ensuring you had an accurate time on the repairs. While most maintenance work takes about 60 -90 minutes, the inclusion of the break lamp repair would have made this repair job slightly longer. Though, that is not an excuse to keep customers in the dark or drop the ball in maintaining a consistent line of communication with the customer. We stress the importance of keeping customers informed, regardless of the status of the repair work as we understand that customers need to plan their time accordingly.\n\nHopefully I was able to provide some clarity, and perhaps one day earn your business back. However, I respect your choice to take your business elsewhere and wish you the best moving forward.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out directly, 424-581-6464"}<//Response>< gmap_id>

When dealing with repeat issues, we typically do not charge any additional diagnostic fees, so if there is a discrepancy in the matter we would be happy to look into it. For simple bulb replacements, like brake lamp bulbs or licence plate bracket bulbs, we typically waive any labor charges as the repairs are non-extensive.

This MINI is the worst. The worst. My gf has been in two Saturdays in a row for a taillight. Each time she has to pay an additional 129 for a diagnosis and 200 for a new socket set. Seriously? For a brake-light. They should be investigated for gauging. Not honest. Not competent.</Text>

< Review>
I just recently moved to LA  and decided to stopped by this new Dealership. I have always been a MINI Fan. I entered the showroom and started taking photos of the MINI's they had to share them with my family. The first dialog I received was "There is plenty of photos you can get at mini US website."  with an attitude. At first, I thought it was a joke. So I told him I was a Fan and had one before. Then he told me that if I was just going to take photos , I should just go on a computer and visit the MINI website. I felt uncomfortable and stopped snapping photos of the dealership and  started leaving. Just prior to leaving , another advisor treated me decent and at least asked me if I had any questions , I started feeling at least there is some decency.  But just that one bad experience made me see other MINI dealerships.</Review>

Asked about constant engine light problem and was then told (when we picked up the car NOT when we brought it in) that that would be another $205 to investigate. We called their customer service supervisor who said he'd get back to us. Never did. Called Mini USA who sent them a request to contact us. They never did. Called Mini USA again and they have apologized profusely and said the should call us but so far not a word. Car is shaking and dying at stop lights, large engine icon is now appearing and something is most definitely wrong. We feel ripped off and so poorly treated. It's a 2009 mini not a new one. I wonder if they just don't want to bother if it's an older car. Very disappointing.<//text>< pics>

I have nothing but nice things to say about this dealership. The service and the sales.
I bought my Mini from them by trading my falling apart fiat. They not only gave an honest price for my old car- I compared with KBB-but they also added some extra floor mats with no charge for my new cooper.
Not long ago I had an issue with my brake pads that needed replacement sooner than I expected. The managers when I approach the issue scheduled my appointment in no time. I had my car fixed in less than 2 hours, washed and ready for me to pick it up. I would definitely recommend them.<//Review>

Was just checking out Minis for my girl and Danny was on the job! After offering me refreshments, he showed me some very cool minis and told me about one I didn't know Mini was going to sell...the Mini E! A hybrid mini! Although hybrid won't be the car for my girl, I'll definitely be coming to see Danny too when I'm ready for my first electric/hybrid  car. We are probably going to wait a couple months before pulling the trigger on a convertible, but thank you Danny for a wonderful experience, I don't plan on going anywhere else!!  If you're looking for a mini and a salesperson who actually cares about his customers, go see Danny right now!!!

For all the negative reviews...not sure how you even had a bad experience...even the receptionists were awesome!<//review>

<Text>I'd like to issue a big warning about this dealership. Their service people are nice guys, but completely overwhelmed. I had a confirmed appointment for a simple inspection. I was told when I made the appointment it would just a take couple of hours. When I dropped the car I had to learn that it will take until the rest of the day (some 5+ hours). Further, they agreed on the phone to charge the credit card of a potential buyer of my car, who is at the East Coast. When I dropped the car, they backed out and told me I have to pay because they’re unable to charge a credit card from someone out of state. I tried to resolve the dispute with the manager, who flatly lied by denying any agreement and turned out to be the rudest car dealer person I have ever met in my life.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I have a very beloved sister who wanted to replace her over 15-yr old Honda CRV.  She does not want much in a car but color that will fit in her budget.  As a single mom, I tried to help her as much as I can, so I made calls, scower the internet looking for the car [color only] at the price she can afford.  I figured out the total out the door price and finally saw a couple in Monrovia which is a ways drive from where we live.  Called the dealership and turns out that the only (2) cars available that are being offered are not the ones in the 3 color choices she & her daughter likes.  But since it was an affordable price, and no other dealerships (southbay, long beach & santa monica) had called, we are pretty much settling to what was on the table.  Oh, southbay responded but felt like they are not being straight forward on the financing numbers that were given to me. We are set to see the cars Sunday, and if Monrovia was able to give us the color, we would have gone there on a Thursday. Then that same Thursday, an e-mail response from "Mike Latkin" came in and needed info for the car we initially inquired about that was more [after taxes & stuff] than what we need to be.  I responded to Mike and told him where we are on the search and how much car it needs to be.  After a few back & forth calls, and some adjustments, wholla!!! my sister is getting the car that she wants that she can afford and does not have to settle for something else.  MIKE IS THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL!!! Hmmm, Larry, the finance guy, not so much but he's ok.  Definitely will recommend this dealership to someone looking for a great fun mini to drive with people who will do what they can to make deal work.  Don't really care about how the place looks [not saying it looks bad].  What really matters are the ones in it.  You ROCK, Mike!  ;-)<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Name>

< Review>
Sam Markowitz is responsible for helping me get my car.  I didn't expect to lease or buy anything.  I just walked into the dealership to simply get an extra key for my [then] 2011 Mini Clubman.  He was so accommodating and charming and sort of distracted me from my key issues, and showed me the NEW Clubman.  I have a dog and grandchildren, and between the dog's crate and the child's safety seat, and other personal needs, he helped us to figure out (in and out with the crate in all models!) that the 2017 Clubman I leased was, indeed, the right one.  Most of all, Sam is pleasant and kind.  And that, from a car salesman, is the most important thing!  Highly recommend!!< /Review>

Quaint little park with a decent amount of space for some physical activity. Came here to play tennis with some friends. Despite only having two full courts, the park had concrete walls in another fenced area that allowed other people to practice/play without needing the full court.<//review>

<Text>This is not a crazy cool park or anything but it's pretty quiet and there is a big area of grass for your pup to run and play. There is also some low hanging trees for climbing and a picnic area with a small playground. The only thing that is unfortunate is the lack of a restroom. I assume the reason for this is to keep out homeless people, which in my opinion is incredibly inhumane. However, if you're looking for a quick stop to let your dog out it's perfect for that.< /Text>< Rating>

Didn't even know this place had a name! Seems like not many people know about the two tennis courts here. Perhaps I shouldn't advertise this because I may not get the courts anymore!< /text>

<user_name>Tim Herrin<//user_name><Text>I have getting my taxes prepared by H&R Block, and specifically Brian Cohn, for more than 2 decades.  He provides a terrific service with a smile, while also closely attending to details of preparing my taxes.  We have built a rapport over the years and I always consider tax season as an opportunity to both visit and work with a friend and colleague.  As a part of the H&R Block team, Brian provides a very appreciated personal touch that will continue to bring me back as a customer in future years.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_id>

<text>I set up an appointment about figuring out what I need from the IRS to fix a taxing issue because I figured they are professionals they would understand. After speaking with the staff member I later sat with, she seemed to have a complete understanding of my issue. During the appointment she had zero recollection of my case nor what I needed help with, after explaining again she proceeded to look through her IRS documentation request forms and repeat “I don’t know what these are for.” At that moment I knew I couldn't be helped and reached for my papers so I could leave. This woman slapped down her hand  over my papers and pulled them towards her saying she wasn’t trying to kick me out. After moments of her just shaking her head and repeating that she didn’t know what to do, I was finally able to leave. I will NEVER consider H &R block staff members any type of professionals again. Accept for the receptionist, honestly they were exceptional.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>Every time I get a letter saying i qualfiy for their emerald advance, and the last 3 years, the bank denyed me. I used to get it very year. Now they never approve me for anything. My suggestion to you is to save your money and do your own taxes because its way easy and costs 10 times less than paying one of these places.</review>< Time>

I wish I could give negative stars. Never in my life have I ever had a nail place mess up my nails so bad! I will post pics to show im not lying. Super horrible work! They also charged me 28 bucks for this! I was literally crying on my way home. HORRIBLE</review>

<review>Second time I come in and everyone is always so rude. The first time a heavy set girl did my nails and she saw she left a bubble in of them and didnt fix it  the bubble was about the size of a small marble and she left it that way anyway. It later peeled and looked horrible.  . She didnt care.  She acted like she didnt notice it. The second time the lady cut me twice.  She didnt apologize and didnt seem to care either.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  This place is just negative.  You come to relax not be on edge.   This is why I stick to my nail place in diamond bar.<//review><pics>None<//pics><time>1548956545988<//time><GmapID>0x80c32df62359e485:0xbf6a33bc81240b0a<//GmapID>< Resp>

Jordan was on time, answered all our questions, even when we would call or text he will/would answer immediately.  Jordan made our experience very comfortable, we really didn't have to do anything, he took care of setting everything up.  Jordan added enough panels so we do not have a true up with PG&E.  The true up's are outrageous.  We are very happy and have recommended Jordan to family and friends.   Make sure you ask for Jordan Garza when you are looking for solar.< /Text>< pics>

<text>After yrs and months of searching and researching, my family and I feel like we made the right decision with Stockdale solar. Kyle was beyond helpful, not only did he address ALL of my concerns but he was extremely patient and supportive. Not once did I feel pressure,  I actually felt like family. He is definitely one hell of a guy to have on your side, I wouldn't trust anyone else!! Thank you Kyle.
Shawn (door man) and everyone at Stockdale solar.< /text><GmapID>0x80ea6825cd5d4a49:0xb659e53e090dc853< /GmapID>< date>

Another victim of their pushy salesman that wouldn't take no for an answer. Came @ dinner time on literally the hottest day of the year & kept asking me personal questions.  After telling him 4 times no, we aren't interested, while holding my dogs back, I had to just shut the door on him... to which he just told me he'd be back... no please dont return. I wont answer the door next time.<//Text>

Working with Aristeo Alvarez from Stockdale solar was a great experience. He answered all my questions with such great knowledge and patience. Always willing to work with my schedule. Stockdale solar has been great so far. I got different quotes from other companies but decided to go with Stockdale. They are family owned have great customer service and so far have been on top of things specially Aristeo. Before buying solar do your research as I did and compare companies. I really recommend Stockdale Solar. Ask for Aristeo he will answer all your questions.

A bit late on posting, but we’ll deserved. I decided to go solar few months ago and wanted a local company, I had reached out before to other companies, but would not hear from any immediately or wanted to set up many appointments to discuss plans and options. I had contacted Stockdale Solar and they quickly responded. I was helped by a gentleman named David who was very knowledgeable and had a lot of great information and education about all the questions we had. David was able to quickly give us information on our options and a quote, I was also very happy that I was able to incorporate a new roof with me going solar. They took care of everything for the roof side of things and the company they used to install our new roof were very quick, professionals and hard workers. They went the extra mile every time after they completed the their work day with cleaning up everything around the house. If you’re looking to get solar I would highly recommend Stockdale Solar and ask for David although I’m sure everyone who works there would be great too.</Text>

<Text>Jordan was very helpful with providing me the right information for getting solar. He set me up with enough panels to avoid a tru up at an extremely affordable price that will never increase. I recommend going with stockdale solar. If your bill is high and worried about solar panels being expensive. Go with stockdale solar they will do there research right in front of you and let you know how much you’ll save.< /Text>< pictures>

David is super friendly, professional, patient, and responsive. There was no pressure on purchasing the system. All my questions were answered. Stockdale Solar was able to get installation done within a short period of time after signing the contract. Very happy with the purchase!! Highly recommended!< /review>

I don't have solar from them but the salesman came to our door at 10am which is really strange for a salesman at that time a day especially around our neighbor hood. I naicely told him three times that I would check for my self when I'm ready and he repeatedly kept on talking and wouldn't leave. So then relentlessly had to tell him to leave. Very direspectful salesman.<//Text>

Very professional.
Tyler Patterson was always available by phone to answer any questions.

Tyler explained the entire program to us, and the company followed through exactly.

Installation was done quickly, the guys kept the area clean, and even through we had a few broken roof tiles, they were replaced by end of installation.

Thank you Stockdale/Solar for a great experience.< /Review>

We added new solar panels to our home through Stockdale Solar. We were pleased with the communication from Stockdale, keeping us up to date with the progress of the project. They were also very good at accommodating our specific request during the installation process. It’s was a great experience working with the good people at Stockdale Solar.< /review>

We hear spiel feel after spiel from young men and women seeking to sell us their respective products.  Stockdale solar got my attention because they are a local company as opposed to some huge corporation that has set up shop in our community. They are a smaller company and do not carry the overhead that the other leading company’s do and therefore the savings get passed to do their customers. We have heard lots of promises but when it came down to it it just did not make sense, until we listened to Stockdale Solar. Everything went down just as they said it would. No tricks or surprises just a nice product handled by a great team that genuinely seemed to care.

Thank you Stockdale Solar

I did my research and chose Stockdale Solar, they exceeded my expectations from start to finish. The micro inverter and solar panels are the best and most efficient in the industry. The footprint is smaller than other systems I see around town. A different company designed a system at my home and theirs needed 34 panels, Stockdale Solar's are more efficient and only needed 24 panels, and the operating system on my wall is a fraction of the size of others I have seen.
I signed the contract on 7/20/17 and by 8/18/17 it was totally finished. Only 21 working days to have an engineer stop by and draw the plans, request the building permits, order the materials, and do the install. I'm very happy with the service I received from Stockdale Solar.</Text>

I was excited to get solar on my house so I went to stockdale solar because I wanted to support “local business” the loan they gave me put a Lean on my home and can’t transfer the loan now that I’m selling my house it’s been a headache I’m basically just going to pay the loan off in full to sell my house ohhh and there is a penalty for paying them off early so my 31k dollar system is costing me 36k, also don’t believe them when they tell you they will pay you 500.00 for having a friend sign up. After I got a neighbor to sign up with them after I bought mine they kept saying they were going to send me a check but it’s been about 8 months now still no check so it’s cool keep your 500 bucks Im I’m escrow right now getting a new house and guess who I won’t be calling for solar....  on a good note the panels did look good, but customer service is bad<//text>

Stockdale Solar is a local company that offers options that are affordable and perfect for my budget. The other solar companies have high pressure salespeople that seem to be more interested in closing a deal then meeting my needs, thats not the case with Stockdale Solar as they were relaxed and come across as very genuine, highly recommend!</Review>

After four separate times of being visited by door to door sales people, I’ve had enough. I have no idea why they came four times in 7 days, but we ALREADY HAVE SOLAR. Stockdale solar is pushy and annoying and canvassing the same  neighborhood over and over.< /review>

I got my estate planing done with the help of Singh law firm. Right from beginning, when I contacted them ,to executing the estate plan, all the staffs has been very pro-active , courteous and very professional. When we arrived at Mr sign's office for the signing, he has already all the documents prepared and we didn't have to wait for any time. He immediately took us through the singing formalities. Mr Singh is very knowledgable and  well trusted estate planning attorney. He explained everything very nicely and made it look so simple. He answered all our questions. Our end to end experience with Singh law firm is pleasant and very professional.</Review>

We engaged the firm for drawing out our Estate Planning. Kern and his team were prompt and kept you updated on the upcoming appointment and what we should expect. Kern and team explains the entire process and every aspect of the bulk document and are patient to answer the questions. Also its pretty safe as they maintain social distancing and mask requirements. All in all a great experience..< /review>

The Singh Law Firm has mastered the process, they are very well planned and professional in their approach. Even though wait for initial meeting was long but it was worth and the process thereafter was completed quickly and to the satisfaction.

Had a great experience with Mr Singh and his team, they are through, to the mark and responsive. Would highly recommend it, plus they don't try to sell you more than what you absolutely need it, in-fact in my case they even gave recommendation to not spend more than its was absolutely required. I like this honesty.< /text>

I went to Singh Law firm for my estate planning needs after I read about their Yelp and Google reviews. While some aspects of it is true, there are many aspects where they fell short with my expectations.

The Positives:

1. They are very responsive , professional and courteous.
2. Mr Singh took the time to walk us thru' the process and what to expect in the same.
3. The front desk can assist with most queries and advice.
4. They are well organized and follow up promptly via email when you have questions.

The Negatives:

1. They are extremely inflexible and can be perceived as rude when you have situations that need them to tailor their approach. As you are aware, the process requires that you notarize documents. Given the current CoVID situation, I was hesitant to visit their offices (I live with elderly folks in my home). So I asked them if there were other options. All I was told there was none. I spent a multiple hours researching online and found that California allows online notarizations if you are able to get it done from notaries in states that recognize online notarizations. When I asked them about it, I was told that their policy is that I sign in their offices. After exchanging half a dozen or more emails on this topic wherein I cited links to multiple sites that indicated that this was acceptable did the firm acknowledge the availability of the same but still strongly recommended I visit their offices. After a few more emails, on the topic Mr Singh agreed to take a phone call. He said while this is allowed, he wasn't in a position to provide any guidance on the topic and that I would be doing it assuming all the risk. I later learnt that this idea of getting notarized online is being recommended and followed by every other firm that does this kind of work except them. To me this wasn't what I expected from a law firm if they care for the well being of the customer.

2. This is yet another example how rigid the firm gets when unanticipated things occur in the process. Soon after I got my documents completed, I decided to take advantage of the low interest rates to refinance my home. In all transparency, I had no plans of refinancing the home at the time I was going through this process. Neither was it made clear AT ANY POINT in the process (documents or such) that I should hold off on any kind of refinancing till the process completes. When the question of  title holder on the property came up, I called them to see what I should use since I was told during the signing process that the update to the county records would take 12-15 weeks. The front desk person said that it was OK to go ahead with the refinancing process with the name on the title to be what it is currently since the county processing is going to be longer than closing. I called them again a few weeks later since the refinancing company wanted some clarifications. During the second call, I was told that I should have notified them "before" they started the name transfer and now it is out of their hands and that they have no "advice" for me to provide at this time.  I felt like I was out on a limb. This process is being played out as we speak and I hope it doesn't get things complicated.

In summary, I think the firm may be good if you are able to stick to their rigid guidelines and aren't expecting any flexibility in the process. Also try to use email to communicate with them since you will need if for your "records".<//review>

I’m glad we were able to handle your Estate Planning remotely for your parent’s safety considering the COVID pandemic.\n\nI’d like to address the issues you've brought up to bring some clarity to you.\n\n1. California DOES NOT allow for online notarization. Please review the Secretary of State’s website and analysis on this here:\n\nhttps://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/bizfile/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions/\n\nWe did instruct that we cannot comment on another’s state’s online notary, as we’re not notaries of another state (only California). We did instruct you that so long as the online notary you were going to get done (from another state) was done following the rules and regulations of that state’s notary rules, then the documents would be executed properly for purposes of California.\n\n2. Our staff correctly instructed you that when we submit your deed for recordation with the county recorder’s office, it could take 10-12 weeks.  Also, if we knew you were going to refinance prior to us submitting your deed, we would have held the deed in our office and let your refi complete prior to submitting. Once a deed is mailed for recording, we have no control over it.\n\nWe’ve been there by your side through the entire process and will continue to only provide you the best service and guidance as you’ve outlined above."}</Response>< GmapID>

The Singh Law Firm made estate planning very simple and hassle free. Also was very effective and their questionnaire was simple and easy to process and digest. Even the appointment was very safely done taking into account the covid situation and completed gracefully. Would definitely recommend them to friends for estate planning</Text>

Singh Law Firm is excellent for Estate Planning. We set up a Family Revocable trust and Estate Plan by them. Their process is very streamlined. Kern had a teleconference with us and answered all our questions. Later we filled in a questionnaire and sent them our wish list. Sharmila was extremely knowledgeable, responded to all our questions and guided us through the process efficiently. They were meticulously prepared and our in-person signing appointment with Kern went very smoothly. Gavin in their office also helped us to set up appointments, questionnaire etc. We are happy to recommend Singh Law Firm team for any estate planning requirements.<//Text>

<text>We recently got our Living Trust and Will done by the Singh Law Firm. There is no doubt that Mr. Singh is very professional and answers all your tricky questions with clarity.  Being an engineer, I had many many of these. Once, he even took time to call me back.

The most flabbergasting part of the whole process was the meticulous preparation that the firm did before our visit to the office. For example, they had already procured all the necessary details from the county. Other businesses should learn the depth of heavy-lifting Singh Law Firm does for their clients.< /text>< Gmap_id>

The Singh Law Firm has been very professional and knowledgeable. I grew up in Mission San Jose since I was 2 years old and continue to live in Fremont. Yes I went to Chadbourne, Hopkins and Mission schools. My Mom had found the Singh Law firm and after visiting with her decided to, very recently, creat a trust and will. The initial contact was through emails and the process was finished in person with distancing and masks. From stepping in to his professional office to leaving was a pleasure. Everything we went over was perfect and well explained and there were no surprises. I highly recommend Kern Singh law firm.< /text>

<Text>Attorney Kern Singh is amazing! He explained all the details to us at our grade-6 understanding of facts, and also gave us an annotated list of action items to follow up on.

It took a while to get our appointment (not difficult, just booked well in advance) but it was totally worth it.< /Text>< pics>

Excellent service!  I had a 30 minute discussions on phone with Kern where he answered all my questions and provided a guidance on how to fill out an estate planning questionnaire which was due before the appointment date.  On the day of the appointment, all the documents were ready and we were done in 30 minutes!  Overall a great experience. I highly recommend him.</Text>

<Text>I was introduced to The Singh Law Firm by a friend of mine whom I regard highly.   From the very first time I met Kern Singh, I found him and his firm to be very professional, thorough and easy to get along.   Kern's knowledge for estate planning is really deep and he did a wonderful job for us.   At times I have had to call on Kern for advise on estate matters and he always returned my call promptly.  I had also introduced Kern to other friends of mine and their experience with him have all been great.  I wish the best to The Singh Law Firm.</Text>< Name>

<review>Singh Law Firm was suggested by my company through LegalEASE for my Estate Planning purposes. Here is how the process went:

1. We had a 15 minute phone session with Attorney Kern Singh. The phone question was really brief, I didn’t get to ask any real questions, and was promised detailed explanations on the day of signing.

2.They sent an email questionnaire that had questions about our preferences, which we filled out.

3. Astonishingly, the next step in the process was the actual signing process, which was scheduled a couple of weeks after.

I don’t see how one can go from #2 to #3, without any other steps in between!

We had so many questions about the estate planning process and the kind of plan would be best for us.

I would have expected a couple of rounds of back and forth to decide what kind of plan we would need. I would have expected a preview of the plan to be sent to us so that I and my wife could go over it, and if necessary, make modifications.

On the first (and only) first phone call, Attorney Kern Singh promised that all would be explained on the day of signing. Being very new to the process, I agreed to go to the third step of the signing process. I was expecting, based on the phone conversation, some set amount of time on the day of signing, that would be the “education” process. In retrospect, I don’t see how this would have even worked. If we were expecting to sign on that day, how would I even be able to discuss any of this with my wife?

On the day of signing, we found the Attorney ready with a stack of papers for us to sign. They started the process of notarizing us with thumbprints and driver’s licenses. At this point it became clear that we were just going to go through the signing process! How did they even prepare the documents?? When I pointed out to the Attorney that I was expecting some kind of an education process first, where we will go through what kind of plan we needed, Attorney Kern Singh said that that conversation already happened in the first phone call! I found him to be rude and dismissive.

Again, in retrospect, I am not sure how this process would even have worked. We decided not to sign on that day.

I found another Attorney to do the Estate Plan. This process was everything I had hoped for. Multiple email and phone conversations, early preview of the document, subsequent fine tuning and changing things to our preferences, and then, finally, signing.

I had decided to go to Singh Law Firm seeing all the glowing reviews. But my experience does not match those reviews. Maybe if you need simpler documents, they would do a good job. Maybe the whole Covid-19 situation meant they were too busy. But I don’t see how something as complex as an Estate Planning process can be done the way they proposed to do it. I didn’t work for us.</review>< userid>

Estate planning can be an overwhelming action item for most. We certainly weren't thinking this was going to be easy-peasy.

Now that we're done with ours, having used Singh Law Firm, we wish we could have told our earlier selves to relax! This firm really has it down to a science.

From engagement to close, they tell you what to expect, anticipate most questions, and really know their stuff to get you your trust.

We worked with Sharmila, and she was great. She expertly, patiently, and efficiently walked us through all sections so we understood what everything meant. We ended up having a very particular set of requirements involving overseas family; she understood our situation and worked it into our trust. She also responded quickly and thoroughly in the few instances we had questions.

While simple, just be aware that this will probably take many months to complete from first contact - biggest wait is the first appointment. They're busy so appointments are booked far ahead, and there was a time or two it was hard to get in touch with the staff. However, aside from allowing sufficient time, my wife and I couldn't be more satisfied.< /Text>

It was a wonderful experience getting Kern of the Singh Law Firm to do a restatement of our Trust. From the initial consultation to getting the document completed, we were impressed with Kern's knowledge, his professionalism and responsiveness. We had several questions even after we had signed the document and were impressed with Kern's  prompt and complete responses.
Awesome!!!

Let me start by saying me and my wife were new at understanding the will and trust process. Singh Law Firm (Mr. and Mrs. Singh) were both methodical and took baby steps with us to help us understand the process. They were detailed at each step and full of advice throughout. All our documents were prompt and ready during our appointment time. Everything went as planned and was smooth. Thank you Kern and Sharmila for helping us get this important document through.< /review>

CAUTION : Get everything in writing from this firm else you would see a demand for new charge when you approach them to honor the commitment they had made.
In my case, I was told that new home, whenever we buy, will get added to living trust at no cost and now we are being asked for more $$$...WTH

Stay away OR get everything in writing....<//Review>

A little over a month ago, I had the previledge to meet Mr. Kern Singh and his staff regarding creating my Family Trust. The meeting was very educative and productive. He thoroughly explained the entire process and answered all my questions. He is a very cordial and warm personality who has indepth knowledge of field of his expertise. In nut shell, it was indeed a very rewading experience to be a client of The Singh Law Firm.  I will strongly recomend Singh Law Firm to anyone and everyone!</Review>

The firm appointment system is very great. The admin/receptionist keep dodging on the dates and requires a lot of push. They gave me appointment for a date of five months. Very rude ..</text>

<text>Recently I worked with Singh Law Firm to create a WILL and associated documents. It was a great experience. Very smooth. Kern and his team were well organized and did everything in a timely manner. I would whole heartedly recommend Singh Law Firm to anyone looking for similar services. Thanks Kern.</text>< pics>

<Text>Kern is not only a great attorney but also a very humble person. I reached out to Kern after getting referral from my brother for getting my estate setup. Kern was always very prompt in getting back to me. He was very thorough in explaining all aspects of estate planning and helped us every step along the way in making the right decisions. He never shied away from giving his opinion/recommendation, when asked. He was also very accommodating. My wife and I live over an hour away from his office and could not come during the weekdays, but Kern made special arrangements for us to come on the weekend to go over the documents with him. I have worked with over half a dozen attorneys in my life and Kern, by far, is the best I have every worked with.</Text></record>

I had my trust prepared through another local attorney and was very disappointed with him. But meeting Kern and getting it done through his office was like a breath of fresh air. He is completely professional and a gentleman.I recommend his services to everyone who needs it.< /text>

<Text>My wife and I completed our Estate Planning from The Singh Law Firm. we were thinking about having our estate planning done from last couple of years and it's all done .. Thanks to Kern !!

I usually never give a five star rating, because, really who is that good!  WELL, after our 2 sessions with Singh Law Firm I just couldn't help myself!  He, Kern, was thorough and right on top of every detail, he gave us his phone and email address so that we could contact him anytime & with anything that could possibly come up during this process. Which was perfect since we had few follow-up questions & sent multiple emails with questions & clarification. we got replies in timely manner and all questions were answered. we've also learned quite a bit about estate planning process, rules and regulations just by talking to him. he was right with us throughout the entire process. we almost feel as if we made a friend as he was so kind. Kern and supporting staff members are amazing.

we couldn't have been more pleased with our experience. It's sometimes hard and difficult to find a law firm that you can trust and depend on. At " The Singh Law Firm" they take pride in their work & really communicate with their clients.  I highly recommend The Singh Law Firm, to my family, friends and to all the googlers  reading this.

<Text>They have now started a drive thru timer system. The staff are now asking customers to move to parking lot and wait for food. Happened to me the last two times at two different locations. I asked what had changed and I was told about new system. I do not like waiting in parking lots, do not feel safe,, so I won't be returning.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dca50dfd762219:0xea6612ed87819aaa< /gmap_id><UserId.>116427125740802769391</UserId.><Rate>3</Rate><Pics>None<//Pics><user_name>KM Sanchez</user_name>< Date>

Great service and quality products. It may take a few minutes to get the order but it's a small wait for food made correct and served fresh. The staff look to be doing a great job keeping the place clean and sticking to a quality covid protocol.</text>

I would recommend the farmer boys in Woodcrest. This place has horrible service with the cashiers only concerned about their drive thru customers. I waited 5 minutes just to order then 15 minutes for my food. I was relieved when I received my food but that feeling was gone in seconds. They messed up my order!</Review>

<review>Usually very good but tried to give me a tablespoon spoon of soup through the drive thru. Instead of telling me they were out, the gave me gloppy dried out soup that they scrapped from the bottom. Thank God I checked the bag after the girl did. So disappointed.<//review>< pics>

<Review>Maybe it's because the location is brand new? But our order was totally botched. They forgot our utensils despite us double checking it was there. They forgot our sides even though it came with our meal. And the food honestly was really bland. I think we'll stick with the Famer Boys in downtown Riverside< /Review>< Date>

This place is definitely a step (or2) above fast food quality,  a bit more expensive than the typical fast food place but well worth the extra
$$$.< /Text>

Every time I go to iSmile it’s such a pleasant experience. I am always greeted and welcomed, the office space is big and immaculately clean, and the staff is friendly and comforting! Teddy was the sweet assistant who took care of me to start, and then the dentist (forget his name) who saw me was really funny and personable. He gave good advice.</Review>

It’s cool they have an extra oral suction for aerosol issues during dental treatment so I felt very comfortable and safe during my teeth cleaning and fillings. They are always kind, professional and up to dated, very state of the art facility I love visiting iSmile. Due to virus issues I was hesitating to visit dentist but iSmile have prepared very well on disinfectant control and social distant management in the office. Very good job iSmile and thank you so much for taking care of my teeth!< /Text>

Front desk Peter was very nice and on top of things. The assistant was great too, prompt to help and making sure I was comfortable. Dr. Park did a great job. I had a delicated situation with a tooth and she went the extra mile. She was very patient and I felt comfortable all the time. I will complete my treatment at this office.

In my past experience of dental cleaning, usually a dental hygienist cleaned my teeth followed by a cursory exam by a dentist. At ISmile  Dental, a dentist dis a very thorough exam first using X-rays and cleaned my teeth followed by a hygienist polishing and flossing. The doctor did not immediately recommend any major procedure at this time. My teeth look great. Thank you!</text>

This morning I had my appointment with Dr. Kim for my two dental implants.  As always, Dr. Kim and all of her staff at iSmile Dental were super kind, courteous and professional and made me feel very comfortable for my implant surgery.  My implant surgery went better than I had anticipated...I was in at 10am and it was done by 10:30am!!  Dr. Kim is the absolute BEST!!  A big THANK YOU to Dr. Kim and her wonderful staff 😊!!!

This dental clinic is really good. I have had an extreme good experience with them to be the first time coming here. The lobby is quite spacious waiting area appropriately marked to accommodate patients (following Covid-19 protocols) and the staff is really polite and professional. This is my story: I’m covered by my new dental insurance until December 31, 2020. Therefore if I don’t use it, I loose it. Due to my job duties I only had Christmas weekend off and found that this clinic is open 7 days a week and not only that: They were able to set up an appointment for me to be treated right at way within the next half hour which I gladly took. The nurse personnel was amiable, and personalized;  the doctor was one of the best I’ve ever had as well as the treatment he provided. I’m really glad I’ve found this clinic and coming back tomorrow to complete a pending deep cleaning. I’m very satisfied with everything done for me here and will continue using their services throughout the next year 2021.< /Review>

<Review>My first time here to get my teeth cleaned and everyone provided great customer service. Even though they were very busy, I was able to be seen earlier than my appointment time.  Also, I had another request about my teeth and they were able to provide an additional service in a timely manner. They are organized, efficient, and friendly!

I have a bit complicated situation for dental care. After few second opinions with other doctors. I cautiously decided to go with Dr. Kim. So far I am at 1/3 of my final target and everything is great.
I would provide more complete review by end of next year.
However if you are wondering which doctor to go with your implant care, I  will suggest Dr. Kim as a strong candidate.</Text>

Came in for a teeth cleaning after getting a post card in the mail. They are conveniently located in my neighborhood, was easy to set everything up with my insurance, professional job done, and even gave me a grand opening gift! Also love that you can watch a movie while getting your dental work to distract you a bit (in case you feel anxious). Glad to have found my new dentist!</Review>

Very professional and careful re-design of the spacious "front office" to protect from Covid-19. Wear your mask. Co-Visitors remain outside.
Friendly and comforting trio handle you and the paperwork smoothly to get you into the chair pretty promptly.

I was there today to have a crown re-cemented. Including some fine adjustments, I was out the door in just 45 minutes.

Dr. Kimberly Kim is a very good organizer, a true professional.

The dental hygienists are doing excellent job on cleaning our teeth.  Special Thanks to Asami, she always goes out of her way to make us feel they care.  That's why we are willing to drive more than an hour to be Dr. Kim's patient.< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Kim is wonderful prosthodontist and implant specialist in the bay area I every met. I have full mouth implant restorations and no longer struggle with dentures. their new office is top notch in this area. Very friendly staffs and Dr. Kim is very experienced and precise too. No pain at all I had for my implants snuggery. I actually went several other dentists who provide dental implants but the service quality-wise, budget-wise, location convenience-wise, etc. I decided to go with Dr. Kim and I am now totally satisfied and recommended Dr. Kim to my friends who are considering dental implants.
Dr. Kim is the best of the best implant specialist in the bay area.
Highly recommended.

New review from today visit!

Dr kim is the none to the second implant dentist best ever I have worked with I am still very satisfied with what they have changed for COVID pandemics They are always very clean and well updated sanitization all over the office Their sterilizations look more updated all staffs with PPE as well as doctor kim Even this pandemic if someone urgently needs dental works This is the right place to visit Thank you so much dr kim what you have done on my implants and I am still very satisfied Highly recommended dr kim to anyone looking for dental implants

My old review from previous visit
Very clean and beautiful dental office. You feel like you might be lost in office! really big!  Compared to outside building appearance, you will meet  surprisingly well equipped modern space the further you go in. I got cleaning done and later I brought my kid for braces consultation. They have so many dental chairs and each has theme! Very bright and pleasant! You feel less nervous here and relieved!  Once you try this one, you might not want to go back to the small old dingy office anymore!
Friendly staffs and nice service!< /review>

I now moved to Washington State. There was an X-ray (full mouth) thats allowed once per 5 years by insurance coverage, and I was not aware that the clinic did and claimed from my insurance until my current dentist staff told me. So I called to request my patient records sent to my email.
I was asked to fill a form, give them my credit card info including card back digits over the phone, and they charge $5 for sending my records to my email.
Feel it doesnt make sense to pay for requesting my own info sent to myself, and so weird to give credit card information over the phone.

If I move back to California, definitely not heading here again.< /text><gmapID>0x808fb12a4e9f25c5:0x3103c5c307337104<//gmapID><Rating>2< /Rating>< Pictures>

<Review>This place is one of the worst. The customer service is ok. But I had a really bad experience and I regret Spending my money for their ortho service. They wanted me to pay for something that they messed up on. I paid the full balance before I started my Ortho treatment. Now that I am almost done with the treatment they want to charge me again for retainers replacement. I told them I can’t pay because one of the dentist assistant accidentally pulled the retainer off while he was doing an impression of my teeth for the new set of Invisalign tray. So it wasn’t my fault that the retainer has to be replace. They insisted on saying that it was part of their policy. and they wouldn’t do it unless I paid. So this place is good at ripping people off. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.< /Review>< pics>

The experience for my implanting in iSmile dental  is really good. Dr. Kimberly H. Kim has the very experienced technique in implanting the tooth. Also she is very kind and nice. The office lady,  Heida,  (don't know exactly the name from china maybe) is very kind to explain me every question and give me more instruction after my implanting, which are all good experience for me . I highly recommend the iSmile dental for your tooth problem and they can do really help for you.<//text>

<Review>I’m a doctor and I would not recommend this place.
I’m very disappointed with this office. I’ve been a patient here for years. I prepaid for a dental plan which included 2 cleanings per year. My plan expired during the COVID-19 shelter in place order and they will not extend my plan. They were closed for cleanings so I couldn’t even make an appointment. I believe this is unethical and I will be making a formal complaint with the board. When I called to discuss all I got was “that’s our policy” and an “I don’t care” tone. It’s hard to believe a doctor’s office would not care about their patients. I would never treat my patients this way.< /Review><date>1589746954895<//date>< user_name>

iSmile came to the bay area last year with a different approach to dentistry & orthodontics. Open office space with huge flat screens in the 20-30 oratories, the whir of hepa - fans in the background give patients the progressive & proactive atmosphere that this is a CLEAN clinic. Well designed & managed with pro-modern investment in cleanliness including 03 or UC-V sterilization & LED lighting, training & professionalism. Their DSP dental savings program saves money annually. At 60 I have 20 teeth left bc parents didn't take kids to dentists in the 70s. After a gentle scaling & cleaning by 1 of their many hygienists, they scan your smile & offer solutions. I decided to invest 5K in a couple implants so I can eat meals in a timely manner. Bc of bone loss I was not eligible for full quadrant implants. But 1 here & 1 there installed expertly by Dr Kim & staff and I enjoy eating again. Life changer! With DSP I saved over 1K this year catching up on my dental health. And got appointments within days. Dont wait, Go for it!<//Review>

I highly recommend Dr. Kim
It's such a relief to find a dentist who's equal parts competent and caring.  In fact, it's something to smile about. Ok, I have to admit, I haven't been to the dentist in a long time, and I am a total fraidy cat.
Dr. Kim is totally sweet, down to earth and just plain NICE. This is how you want a doctor or a dentist to be Knowledgeable, caring and REAL about what you can afford and the best course of action to take. The cleaning was done really thoroughly, the discomfort was completely minimal. She is extremely patient, and went over every little detail with me. I've found my dentist home. Thank you so much, Dr. Kim!  I wholeheartedly endorse this superb clinician and I urge anyone in need of a new dentist to consider Dr. Kim.  I have been to many, many dentists, and I submit that she is the best around here. Moreover, she did Ph.D. on top of D.D.S. In a word, Dr. Kim is awesome!
I hadn't been to the dentist in about a year and a half but she made my cleaning seem as if I go regularly every six months.  Awesome: she's totally upfront and realistic. She makes sure you understand the possible costs before going ahead with procedures and doesn't push you at all. Also, god blesses those tiny hands! When they're in your mouth for 30 mins, it makes a difference.< /text>

I had two molar tooth 30 and 31 implanted by dr Kim, it has been a pain from beginning, more than 6 times went back for loose screws, and one time for broken implant. I Found  out she chose a wrong size(4.3 mm) instead of 5 or 6 mm. She changed #30 but not #31, saying is out of warranty. Also she says they made my abutment(the thing that goes on top of implant) in house, which it failed multiple times, I do not trust her work at all.< /review>

<Review>New review from today visit!

Dr kim is the none to the second implant dentist best ever I have worked with I am still very satisfied with what they have changed for COVID pandemics They are always very clean and well updated sanitization all over the office Their sterilizations look more updated all staffs with PPE as well as doctor kim Even this pandemic if someone urgently needs dental works This is the right place to visit Thank you so much dr kim what you have done on my implants and I am still very satisfied Highly recommended dr kim to anyone looking for dental implants

My old review from previous visit
Very clean and beautiful dental office. You feel like you might be lost in office! really big!  Compared to outside building appearance, you will meet  surprisingly well equipped modern space the further you go in. I got cleaning done and later I brought my kid for braces consultation. They have so many dental chairs and each has theme! Very bright and pleasant! You feel less nervous here and relieved!  Once you try this one, you might not want to go back to the small old dingy office anymore!
Friendly staffs and nice service!< /Review>< Pics>

I have been a patient since 2019. Today is the 1st time I visited the clinic since Covid-19 Shelter-in-place. I felt comfortable and safe. When you walked in they checked your temperature and you need to fill in one page Covid-19 questionnaire about your health. Staff all wear PPE. Patient has to wear face mask and no other than patient allows in lobby.
Noticed there is some sort of eCertificate posted on wall about healthcare meeting covid-19 compliances.< /review>

Very friendly front staff and i was a bit surprised how friendly the dentists were. Most importantly I had good quality work done and transparency on insurance and deductible information prior to any procedures. The staff also offered to watch my baby so I didn't have to ask my spouse to take a couple of hours away from work. All in all a great dental group with a solid business model in my opinion.</Text>

My initial visit was wonderful. Dr. Kim has a great chairside manner, she is technically astute, fast, yet kind and gentle. She has a support person named Asami who really helped me understand my treatment and financial options that was fun to work with,. I mean she is so joyfully kawaii she made me smile as I agreed to pay. Ha ha!
Today is the day after I had three implants and there is no pain! I used ice packs as prescribed immediately following treatment and 1 Ibuprofen in the evening and another late this AM today and no pain, truly amazing! What can I say, I made a 2 hour trip to Sunnyvale from San Rafael because of Dr Kim's reputation and pricing, and it was worth it!<//review>

<review>Dr. Kimberly Kim is a very professional and experienced doctor. She took the time to go over all of the procedures before I had my dental implants. In addition, she was also very patient and answered all of my questions and concerns throughout the entire process.

The staffs in the office were very polite and accommodating. I also like their appointment system.  They send reminder frequently.  I highly recommend Dr. Kim and this office to others.< /review></record>

I had deep cleaning service on Sat & Sun. On sat, I was satisfied but on sunday, service was so terrible. The dentist didn't numb enough. It was so painful. During deep cleaning, the dentist removed the filling by mistake and refilled. but I have to pay that one too. I think that is definite unfair.
Filling is removed by misoperation of dentist. Then i-smile should compensate for that. Next time I will never select i-smile.<//review>

< review>
Fast and super affordable! Called in an emergency teeth extraction with no insurance (first timer here). They were able to fit me in their schedule same day I called - (You may not always be as lucky to get same-day appointments, it depends I'm sure) -Their prices do vary, however given the condition of the 2 teeth, they surprisingly beat every other dentist I've called before this! Had two cavities in the 2 teeth and still managed to spend at least $300 less than what others had offered.
They offer a lot of teeth services, so I made sure to leave with a few brochures. I am definitely coming here regularly now.
I have no complains of the extraction, fast and almost pain free...almost.
Also, their place is kept neat and clean, with cute interior designing! Couldn't help but notice the elegance, very professional.
I recommend them!!<//review>

This is a very clean and modern dental office. The staffs are very friendly and accommodating, I was able to get an appointment on a Saturday which was a definite plus with my crazy work schedule. Dr. Kim took the time to fully explain everything in a way that I could understand. I haven't seen a dentist in several years and was extremely nervous, but they helped me to quickly feel at ease.
Dr. Kim takes a conservative approach, prioritizing what needs to be fixed first and what can wait. I found this to be a refreshing change from other experiences I've had in NY with doctors trying to maximize invoice amounts instead of addressing patient needs. These are good people.

If your 'on the fence' about which dentist to choose like I was, do yourself a favor and check this place out!</review>

iSmile is a level above any other dentists we've tried in the area. The professionalism and quality of dental care is simply superb. The doctors and hygienists are always on time, the reception staff are warm and courteous and the premises are top class and are continuously improving (during my last visit I've noticed the addition of tv screens on the ceilings of the exam rooms - great when you need to bring in your kids!). Location is also quite convenient wether your driving or taking public transport and there is always parking on site. Most importantly they take the time and care to figure out treatment in the best interests of the patient and are completely transparent in explaining why they are or aren't doing something - in my case I had two wisdom teeth extractions, Dr Kim suggested that we do them a month apart (would've been easier for her to do both at the same time), turned out she was right, one of the surgeries took a lot longer to heal, would have been much more difficult for me to have to deal with both at the same time.
Our whole family are iSmile patients and couldn't be happier with our dental care :)!
Thanks iSmile!<//Text>

I love how quick Dr. Kim and her staff work together to give me the best dentist visit, I've ever experienced. Finding a dentist one feels comfortable with, is essential. I appreciate how much concern Dr. Kim has in my families health, reminding us to brush and floss :)

GREAT JOB!!!! I am still mind boggled about why I didn't come to this dentist office fist.< /Review>

The people here are all very nice and professional.  The place is very clean with enough space and no crouding.  Adequate silence,comfortable entertainment in lobby.  Excellent professional service.  There is usually no wait at all and they attend one at the time of their appointment.  There is adequate tolerance when it comes to making appointment, and they are flexible too.  They explain everything that they are going to do before they do it.  Also, the dentists here just make you feel very welcome and at home.  The process almost feels like a walk in because it all goes by so fast.  I'm very thankful for their attention.</Text>

I got my wisdom tooth out today and Dr. Kim did a great job! It was painless and quick! Everything was clean and clam. Front ladies were friendly.  I would like to give it a 5 stars but had to take a star out. I guess the assistant I had was new so she did not know how to use the Xray machine. So she asked another assistant for help. The person who helped the new assistant was rude! First, she told her to "get out" then told me to "step outside" and told the new assistant to "Look what I am doing" "Fix that!" "Come here!"  I just stood there watching both of them trying to figure out a machine for more than good 5 mins.< /Text>

Absolutely disgusted with our experience. I'm surprised it's rated so high on Google, if you check other review sites, they will show a different picture.

In sum:
Unacceptable services (can't speak about the dentist, but the hygienist and office staff were very unskilled and unprofessional), deceptive and misleading advertisement, poor communication and follow-up, and failure to send copies of x-rays when asked initially, and then later demanding a fee of $100 for a copy which had never been mentioned in previous communication.

The full story is below.

We got an ad for them for a promotional combination package including cleaning and x-rays and evaluation. My husband was due for a cleaning but we had just moved, so we didn't have local dental insurance, so we decided to give it a try. When my husband got there they did a full x-ray that took over 40 min, doing way more shots and angles in the mouth than we have ever done at any other dentist office. Not only that, they were very rough and made it uncomfortable, and we're rude to my husband when he asked for a break to close his jaw.

They  then did a very superficial and basic cleaning, which was nothing approaching what we have had done elsewhere, and told my husband that the full cleaning wasn't included in the package. (If we'd known that we would have gone elsewhere for a proper thorough cleaning.)

Needless to say we did not go back but went to a new dentist. So we sent an email asking for a copy of the xrays. No one answered the email. We called, and they said they would send them, "oh, I'm sorry we forgot, we'll get them over to you", but did not. We sent multiple emails (none of which were ever answered) and called multiple times and they were never sent. Now when we spoke to them most recently, they said that we would need to pay $100 for a copy of the xray.

Do not recommend this office to anyone.</Review>

I made two trips from Oahu to Mountain View to have four lower implants done by Dr. Kim, and am very happy with the results. The entire staff was friendly, professional, and well trained. Even after my work was completed in June, iSmile's insurance expert continued her efforts on my behalf, resulting in a successful claim after the fact. iSmile Dental is a gem!< /text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><rating>4< /rating><user>115156622308011667289</user><Review>I really enjoy this dentist. Already had a few visits last year and this year. They have their own kids room and it seems presentable to the kids and also have TVs the kids can watch on the ceiling.

The first dentist my kids had didn’t really leave much of an impression for me however today’s visit did leave an impression.

I called and they were able to fit me in right away/same day! My son Julian got to meet with Dr. Stevens Ko. He was very quick, detailed but also straight to the point and made me feel we were finally going to do with something about Julians teeth.

Last year I came to get another consultation with a different doctor and even signed a treatment plan of about $6,000. I told them cost wasn’t really much of an issue and they told me they will give me a call to book an appt for the procedure because they had to talk with the physician etc however I never received a call from them about the procedure and I kind of forgot about it, which is why I minused 1 Star from this review. Working for a hospital myself and being in charge of procedure appointments i know how important it is for me to stay on top of the schedule for my clinic and for my clients convenience, and this is the same expectation I have for other businesses too.

Today, Dr. Stevens made me feel that this was important to him and urgent and that it needs to be done ASAP which I felt too! So I like that he made me felt he really cared!

At the end of the appointment I spoke with the receptionist and she is very sweet, professional and nice but she did not make me feel confident that they would make the effort to update and call me when they find out a set date for me. I kept asking her what’s the time frame of when I’ll hear from her and she really couldn’t give me answer which made me feel that this could possibly take longer than a month and that’s what I’m trying to avoid.

Overall I’m very satisfied with this dentist and the little toy section they have for kids and it’s always clean and really nice and big for a dentist. I will definitely recommend this place to family and friends!</Review></record>

I went back recheck on one cavity that was done by Dr.Kim as it has constantly pain.  I double checked with Rafael while make appointment that this shall be a non charge visit (takes only few minutes to recheck and did nothing on teeth).  End up that I received a bill today.  What's wrong with ismile dental billing????  It's horrible!<//Text>

I've been coming to iSmile Dental for years now, and I've pretty much always had a pleasant experience. One thing (from my recent routine dental appointment visit) that I was NOT happy about was the fact that AFTER I left the office (after my appointment was done), I received a text message informing me of my next scheduled visit (which I did not schedule). I specifically told the front desk receptionist as I was leaving that I would like to wait to call in to schedule my next appointment due to my work schedule, but the system still went ahead and scheduled a random date and time as "my next visit". When I went back to the office to ask what that was about, the girls informed me that the "system automatically schedules the next appointment for 6 months out". In my opinion, that is inefficient and a waste of everyone's time since I have to call back to cancel an appointment I never made. Please fix this! Staff should be able to disable the automatic scheduling feature on the computer system.</Text>

The doctors and staff are friendly,  the place is efficient like a manufacture with a production line . But the retainers are extremely uncomfortable and torturing . I dreaded of putting mine on every time for over a year. It was a nightmare.  I have mentioned my " misery"  many times to doctors ,  unfortunately they could not do much to help.  .I have had friends who never had any complains about the quality of their retainers. There is a difference as to where you get your Invisalign done. Choose a good dental office and doctors are extremely important to avoid the suffering of getting your teeth corrected .< /Text>

I really enjoy my doctor and team. I feel confident in my treatment plan and also love how well things are progressing with my braces so far. There are pains associated with braces that are out of all our control. This time even though I didn't feel any poking before I left my last appt,  I do now. Easily though I will be able to see one of the ortho assistants for some relief. I plan to call to be seen after work. In the meantime I use some wax to cover the pokey wire.

Personally my only concern was not being introduced to a new assistant (to me). I like to be involved every step of the way in my care. Everyone is covered in mask so even a quick hello would have been nice for me.

Overall very happy with ismile.< /text>

I am scheduled my next implants and very satisfied with what she has done for me. Highly recommended anybody needs dental implants She is the best of the best in the Bay Area dental implants, full mouth restorations I no longer use dentures, my smiles and food chewing give me confidence on my dental implant decision going with her, I was the person very scared about any dental procedures but due to Dr. Kimberly Kim, my dental phobia disappeared any more Frankly ISmile Dental price is not that really budget but with the high quality I got this is very reasonable for me They use straumann and Nobel I think is the #1 worldwide market share European brand made me assured I did not want other non reliable implants brand They use straumann implant for me and it's very reliable so for I do not have any problems and issues and planning to have remaining parts as with implants soon Her surgery time is very quick and accurate as well as painless I felt she is very experienced implant dentist I am very satisfied with my decision with this office Recently I visited their office I can they have heavenly prepared for more protecting patients during this COVID situation Of course very clean office airways< /review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Dr. Kimberly Kim is the most horrible dentist I have ever known. I was there on September 9, 2015 to get my implant surgery. Dr. Kim ignored the most fundamental but very important protocols of dental implant to measure the gum bone depth to begin with. But she omit this process and start to drill and insert the implant anchor way deeper than my bone depth and hit my nerve hard. I felt serious pain right after she finish the surgery and I made strong complain about the pain. Then she took a X-Ray to find out she drilled and inserted the anchor way too deep that she had to take the anchor out. It took more than 2 hours to nullify the operation which damaged my nerve.

I am seriously injured and still having severe acute pain and 70% of my mouth area is still numb. I had to see a neurosurgeon for treatment. I have to miss my work many days. And I have to take medicine for more than 10 pills each days.

As of today, there are 3 weeks already has been passed but my injury does not get better, and I do not know how long I have to go through this horrible pains and discomfort. My neurosurgeon told me my nerve may be permanently damaged but I have to wait a couple of months to be sure.

I am writing this review to protect other patients who may go through same horrible experiences I have been through now that please do not go to this dental office for your own sake. Dr. Kimberley left the operation room a couple of times to see other patients while she was on my implant operation and made serious mistake on my implant surgery.<//Text>< Pictures>

Like you, we have been to numerous dentists over the years and we have seen the good, the bad, and the evil. Dr. Romero is by far the most gracious, grateful, modest, considerate and HONEST of all. Especially, his wonderful staff are truly a blessing-from the front office, to assistants and dental hygienists. This review is for you and it is meant to benefit you. I wanted to let everyone know that with him you will not lose your money or dignity by being cheated of thousands of dollars. He is truly an awesome decent professional with big hearts.< /text>

Excellent from the front office staff, to hygienist, to dentist. Everyone is very friendly and explained each step throughly. Best cleaning I've ever had and incredibly gentle. So grateful to have found Dr. Romero. Will definitely be sticking with this office from now on and referring family and friends.</Review>

< review>
I’m so happy with Doctor Romero’s dentistry.  He’s very caring and he knows what he’s doing.  It’s really hard to find a dentist who you feel comfortable with, but you feel very safe at this dentist office.  His staff is friendly and I even have my niece going to see him all the way from Beverly Hills!  I would highly recommend Dr Romero!< /review>

This office has earned their 5 star reputation. Every member of the staff went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. They explained everything in detail, squeezed me in as an emergency patient (broken tooth), and got me in and out fast. I would (and already have) recommend!<//review>

Great staff and Dr. Romero is very professional. He saved a tooth that I was told by another dentist would have to be pulled. Annette the hygienist did a very thorough cleaning on my teeth which I appreciated very much and was very kind. It is a great office!< /text>

I have been terrified to go to the dentist for a long time. This experience was a good experience. I had a tooth ache and did not know exactly what was going on. Dr. Romero was able to diagnose and identify really quickly what was going on. He explained everything very well. The whole staff from the assistants, to the receptionist were great to deal with. I felt sincerely cared for. Being new to the area I am glad I found a great dentist.<//review>

<text>My crown popped up while flossing today!  New to the area I was definitely aprehensive about finding a new dentist right away. Sigh
I call Dr Romero’s office (during lunch and they answered right away!) and the girls on the phone were super nice and got me in within a few hours.
Dr Romero was great!  Fixed my crown without issue and got on with my life.

I must say I’m so very thankful to all the participants of J.C Romero DDS from the front desk to the doctor dentists they all go above and beyond for their patient’s. I found them one day on google and based on their 5 star out of over 200 reviews and blessedly I choose one of the very few best out there for sure. They are amazingly awesome!! Very friendly and actually care for you. Thank you guys.

This was my first visit to J.C Romero DDS dental office and I must say I walked out very satisfied. Everything I must get done was absolutely well explained by both dentist Romero as well from Shelby I think that’s her name, she’s amazing she makes sure to re explain everything in full detail, very caring and kind of a person! Romero and her will make you feel welcome and definitely make you feel beyond comfortable🙏. I am thankful I came across their office on goggle they have nothing but 5stars, can’t go wrong with that🙂<//text>< pics>

I had to give a 5 star because the dentist I forgot her name but shes was the best she asked me " Am I hurting you" she made sure if i was okay. Best dentist I ever went to. They are always welcoming you and say "how's your day" that's shows that they are the best dentist to go to.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Went to Dr. Romero today to have a cavity filling replaced. It was a very old cavity and its filling fell out. Dr. Romero found I had a bigger problem as two of my teeth needed a root cannel and caps. I am so happy he found these before I get on the airplane to fly home.
Anyway, he and his staff were the friendliest group of people I have come across. They made me feel comfortable, and not like a stranger. I highly recommend if you need a dentist,  you go to Dr. Romero. He and his staff will take great care of you.</review>< pictures>

From the moment we called the first time to Dr. Romero 's D.D. S  office the receptionist Mariah was kind and courteous, our questions were answered with clarity and professionalism. Dr. Romero and his staff are informative, kind, and professional. We are thankful for his excellent work and reasonable cost for Dental Care.</review>

Going to Dr. Romero's office is always a pleasure.  Friendly staff and atmosphere. Dr. Romero is very friendly and a good dentist.  I have been going to this office for 20yrs. now.  No plans to change.  Was given a new hygienist, Annette and she was friendly and did a good job cleaning my teeth.< /Review>

Overall, my first visit here was great.  They were accommodating to my schedule when making the appointment.  All of the staff and Dr. Romero here are very nice and personable - it's nice to find a dentist like this again.  They explained everything they were doing and any issues they found, the front office explained what insurance covered/costs for the work they recommended.  The office is very clean and setup so social distancing can be done within the office due to the Covid19 thing.  Every interaction with the different staff here was a pleasant experience which made it very comfortable for me.  I don't really have anything bad to say as it was a good experience even for going to the dentist.  Is it weird that i'm somewhat excited to go back for my next appointment?!?!</review>

I could not be happier.  The office staff was genuine, caring, helpful and friendly.  Dr. Romero was very cordial, efficient and straight forward.  He did NOT up-sell or push procedures.  He listened to me, to my concerns. and to my financial situation.  I felt like he was very competent.  I will return to him for further evaluation and for dental crowns.</Text>< Pictures>

Doctor Romero is very nice and does a great job. He always explains what needs to be done in detail so you can understand what is happening. Also all of the staff are amazing and kind, taking the time to talk to you and make you feel comfortable.Especially Gina who is the sweetest thing in existence.
They also have snacks and drinks in the waiting room.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Dr Romero is so honest. Older crown popped out and I thought I would need the whole works - new filling and crown. But he took an X-ray and all was well so he re-cemented it and I was good to go. He’s very careful to make sure it fits too. Explains everything as he goes so you know what’s going on. Highly recommend him.< /review>< Pics>

I am lucky to have found Mr Romero and his staff. I came in with a broken tooth which unfortunately could not be saved. Mr Romero explained what needed to happen and answered all of my concerns. He made sure throughout the procedure I was comfortable and ok with no pain just small pinching from the numbing shot. My experiences with the dentist in the past have always been horrible. Mr Romero is the first dentist I’ve come across that is skillful, knowledgeable and caring in his profession. I feel such relief when I come to his office. I am truly in good hands with Mr Romero and his wonderful staff. Thank you.</text>

I can’t say enough on how I appreciate,  Dr Romero and his staff. I had a mouth full of bad teeth and was petrified to even go to a dentist.
I have been having dental work done  consistently since the beginning of the year, I no longer have fear, and look forward to my visits knowing his work has been top notch.
Each and every one of his staff that works for him is wonderfully pleasant. I highly recommend their services.<//text>

<Review>Friendly staff and Dentist.  Dr Romero was prompt with a comprehensive examination to identify the source of my tooth pain.  Dr. Romero reviewed x-ray results and photographs with he and explained the procedure, in detail, that I would need to resolve my problem.  Insurance biller was friendly and patient while explaining my insurance coverage.  I plan on recommending this Dentist to all of my friends, family, and co-workers.<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< resp>

Dr. Romero and his staff are patient friendly and very thorough at explaining steps through out the "chair" visit.

Dr. Romero is the best dentist I ever had! He is very pleasant, understanding, and does excellent work. Terry is wonderful, kind, and takes good care of me when I call in either to schedule or if I have an emergency. I definitely recommend anyone looking for a new dentist to go see Terry and Dr. Romero ❤<//Text>

I have gone to Dr. Romero for over five years and would recommend him highly.  His hygienist, Bree, is warm, efficient and helpful.  As are all of his  staff, including his assistant, Karen.  I don't believe you could find a better dentist in the area.<//text>

<Text>Had my first visit today and i must say it was a great experience. Very friendly welcoming staff, no long waiting in the waiting room, awesome dentist. Dr Romero reviewed my xrays and gave me a detail breakdown of what is needed to be done on my next visit. Then had a detail explanation of insurance fees/co-pays so i know what to expect to pay. The fees are definitely much more reasonable here than Menifee Dental. I now look forward to my next visit.< /Text>< user_id>

Very satisfactory, everyone is pleasant & Brein (Dental Hygenist) is excellent at what she does. Was not  seen by Dr. Romero this visit but he is very professional & has a pleasant demeanor. I recommended him to my father who plans to make an appt. I am very happy with your facility & staff.</text>

<review>Midway car rentals offers great cars at great prices with an exceptional service. We booked an Volvo S60 but were upgraded to a BMW 3 series. The car was great and rode for 3000 miles in 14 days. The car pickup and drop off were super smooth. Highly recommended 👍🏻< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpoExRbSwpzi-GmZXf-c1Mn6pegTFADnMj0MO2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiC8KvtqI0npgf_xCRiG7MM7UWLHCSfyJinQci=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Awful, disheartening.  My son rented a Nissan Altima and then was taken very ill to St. John's Hospital where he is still a patient.   The car was at his residence and he asked his sister and I to return it on time Friday the 30th. I called the midway SM branch to explain that I was returning the car and to check the details.  "Oscar" looked up the contract and told me that the car wasn’t due until Monday.  Since getting the keys and car wasn't easy, we decided maybe Monday would be easier.  I specifically told Oscar that my son had said Friday. He looked at whatever he was misreading and assured me that it was Monday. He also never mentioned Beverly Hills and said, "See you Monday" (Santa Monica.) Then when we returned it, my son, who hadn't even driven the car, got charged for a 3 day extension. What?????   Dave, the SM manager said, well, if you got an extension, we have to charge you.  We neither asked for or wanted an extension, this "Oscar" character said it was due Monday. We have enough troubles this week, with my son in the hospital, and it feels awful to be treated with such incompetence.  Arbi, manager at the BH location said he'd credit two of the three days overcharged, and mentioned that "Oscar" is new. But my son shouldn't pay for Oscar's error.  If the company had any decency,  they'd give him a break and a credit for when he's well again.  Life is hard enough but when you have to deal with such awful service and be overcharged as well, it just makes life sad and more difficult. Cathy Crosby, SM</Text>

Great experience! My man and I decided to go for a dream car rental for the weekend and they did not disappoint! I’ve been a long time customer of the Enterprise, Avis, Hertz places and had unfortunate experiences with most of them, this was NOT like that at all! super easy and quick. We made our reservation online and were in and out in about 30 minutes.

I also saw some people had issues with gas charges after returning, but they are very clear about it when you’re renting, so if you aren’t listening or don’t read your contract, it makes sense 🤷🏼‍♀️< /text>

My experience was extremely unpleasant. Arby was the associate who assisted us, he made us feel uncomfortable and discriminated against. He aggressively told us they don’t take the payment method we provided, so we gave him a different credit card. Upon asking us where we were going we answered to San Diego for medical procedures, he then asked if we will be crossing the boarder which I found to be extremely offensive. He kept looking at us in a belittling manner. Very disappointed since we rented a car from this location in the past without any problems.<//Text>

<Review>Ivan helped me today and he explained everything on the paperwork crystal clear. Im so glad I went with midway the customer service is beyond. They had my car ready to go and Ivan even spent time to explain to me the features of the car! I was in and out in less than 30mins.

<text>I really needed a car, and when I arrived they would not let me have the car I booked. Please note: THEY DO NOT ALLOW RENTALS WITH A DEBIT CARD!!!

Really good customer service. They show great care in their products and customers. Their prices are high due to the smaller amount of cars they have on their fleet, but they make it up by having an amazing and welcoming service.

Rented their 100D and gave me a discount on the P90D Model X due to a mistake in their model advertising on the website (wrong model listed).

Couldn't be happier with those two cars.< /text>

If you are in the Beverly Hill California area rent a car from Midway they are the best. You can return the rental to Lax! I only use Midway and they have exotic cars!👌👋👋</Review>

While they might seem like a smaller rental shop, their customer service is top notch and better than any other place I've been to. It wasn't just the fact that they gave me a free upgrade but their attention to detail and helpfulness stood out.</review>

<review>I've rented from M Car exclusively for the last 2 years. Not only do they have a pristine fleet of new vehicles, their customer service is always on POINT!! The people there bend over backwards to help you and make sure you walk out the door a happy customer.

<text>Worst car company. I had a reservation with them, I called to postpone my pick up for the next day, and the lady on the phone said it was fine, and rescheduled my pick up. When I call them next day, they say they cannot postpone it, and that I should have picked it up yesterday, and refused to rent me the car or any other car whatsoever to replace the car they promised me and didn't have anymore. Ridiculous. Be aware that you might not be able to pick up your car whenever they tell you, and they will refuse to help you in that case.< /text>< userid>

< Review>
Came into LA from Canada for work last minute and needed a rental vehicle. If you’re not familiar with this kind of circumstance it can be a massive complication.

Juan and his team at Midway in Beverly Hills we’re not only accommodating but also professional, personable, smart, and so kind. We must have jumped over 10 different hurdles to get me into a vehicle in a timely fashion.

I will not use another establishment to rent from solely based on the fact that I know they will do what it takes to treat their customers exactly how they derserve... regardless of the complications.

6 out of 5 stars for these rockstars.

Thanks team,

... Dennis<//Review>

I was charged $59 for a 1 day rental on a Nissan Versa...I rented the car on the 18th, turned it in on the 19th...and It came out to be $34 more than the $25 estimated price...Their agent even told me that my usage would only come up to $25 with tax included and ended up being 136% more than what I was told. Seriously?....

I am not doing business with such a dishonest company ever again. No thanks.< /review>< pics>

It's McDonald's. I don't really like it. I eat it out of habit and convenience. As far as quality is concerned, this particular location always makes food fresh. I don't know why, but they come correct no matter what time of day..m< /text>

<review>Worst place to go eat near by! I ordered a number 5 medium, special iCal y said with hot mustard for nuggets, after I paid i get my order just friends and drink no nuggets, after paying 5 bucks I told the woman on windows and she says is 6 dollars more! You are asking me to pay more because of your mistake and lack of care to your customers???? Never going back again this place is trash, and still no dinning room open when everyone is, trash<//review>< user>

You know that this is a REALLY good McDonald's to eat at when you go BEFORE lunch, and get some of the BEST freshest, saltiest fries AND they give you extra sweet and sour sauce without you having to ask🤗<//text>

It is a McDonalds, the criteria to see if the McDonalds is any good is if the soft serve machine works. It does, the food tastes like any other McDonalds, the service is good. If you want McDonalds, this is a strong option.</review>

It's a place I grew up with in name and this store I lived near a few years back. It was well staffed and at lunch time I didn't have to wait too long to place my order. It's Part of America's History For Many Adults and Children. Gotta love there collectible happy meal Toys that come along with a child's meal.<//Text>

My 5 is for my addiction to Mocha Frappuccinos. LOL These had the perfect blend and NICE amount of drizzle inside so as you drink, you get little microburst of chocolate, yum.

Everything is still drive-thru, and will be for me, except the RARE times I get an egg & sausage patty, because I am allergic to wheat so have to worry about cross-contaminates at a lot of places, that cook fries with wheat products, or flip my eggs using a pancake turner, either of which would lock me in their bathroom, till 911 could get there.<//review>

Waited for 10 minutes for them just to take my order in the drive thru. Nobody ended up taking my order. It took me less time to go to a different McDonald’s and get my order. It’s sad how easy there job is and still can’t do it right.</Review>

Woow ZERROOOO STARS. Ordered a large fries and mocha frappuccino. Had the fries right, then deleted like an idot and put two quarerpunders with cheese.....

The wouldn't change back and ignored me in the drive through, while helping other two vehicles. McDonald's all together almost lost a customer, permanently. Considering I go to three McDonald's four times a week. Not good.< /review>

Had to pull over to the side and wait for my order. Only car in drive thru and 2 customers inside. Only ordered a #2 with sweet tea. Young lady at 1st window who took order was awesome. Very good customer service on her part. 2nd window, was getting frustrated because she gave me unsweetened tea. I asked for sweet tea. All good, never know how a person's day is going.</review>

<review>Manager in charge today was obviously very ill. She coughed at the drive thru window 4 times as she waited for my food to be handed to her. When she realized it was taking longer than usual to pack up a small fry and hamburger she proceeded to bag it herself and I refused to take it from her knowing it has germs. I got my refund and she wasn’t very happy about that, the look on her face said it all.</review>< pics>

They leave the fries sitting there forever. They make sure they only fill up the fry container half way, so when you order your fries they top the old fries with the new ones. So half of the fries you eat are old. One time they threw old fries back in the oil and gave them to me. This McDonald's is always trying to give people old fries.<//review>

< Review>
This McDonald's has poor service when you have an issue and terrible food. My daughter (luckily) took a sip of her milk and said it tasted funny. The expiration said April 26, 2019 and this incident occurred on April 20, 2019. By date, the milk was not expired, but after smelling it, it was absolutely spoiled. I let the lady know and suggested she smell it, but she just said she didn't want to because she's lactose intolerant. She handed me a second milk, which I opened and smelled; it didn't smell very bad, but smelled just off enough for me to consider it spoiled also. The lady called over 2 people who seemed like managers and no one seemed to know what to do. I was offered another milk (after 2 spoiled? Ummm, no thanks). The 2nd lady (a manager, I believe) literally TOOK A SIP OUT OF BOTH MILKS!!! Who does that? Have you seriously been scammed about spoiled milk enough times that you feel the need to taste them to make sure my child and I aren't lying? I was offered a large drink, which I declined. Finally, I offered to pay the upcharge to make it a small strawberry banana smoothie. I was told "A dollar or a dollar fifty. I don't know". I pulled out my receipt as I had just ordered 3 happy meals (2 cheeseburger and 1 6 pc nugget) and a mcchicken, and had upgraded the drink on the chicken nugget kids meal to a small strawberry banana smoothie, and it showed the upcharge as 41 cents. They finally just made a smoothie and seemed very displeased as they said "you're fine. Sorry for the trouble". When I got home, I also saw I was charged 22 cents for the one dipping sauce I asked for, but I had a chicken nugget kids meal... All around poor customer service, spoiled milk, inaccurate charges and my mcchicken and nuggets were tough and barely warm (which may have just been due to how long it took me to simply replace a spoiled milk as I literally live 2 blocks away). I will drive out of my way to go elsewhere despite living a literal 3 minute drive from this location!< /Review>

This drive through is always busy, full of cars but that is because locals know that the drive through is always fast fast fast. Go ahead and drive through, you will have your food quicker than parking and running in. They also handle a pretty good size walk in crowd. You'll see everyone sooner or later.</text>< Pics>

Awful, just awful
I've been to many McDonald's locations and I've never had as bad of an experience as I had here
Took me 20-30 minutes to get through the drive through (with only one car in front of me) because of numerous issues including the guy taking orders in the drive thru having a heavy accent and we couldn't understand each other. I spoke to the manager at the window and I thought we cleared things up but it turns out she also got my order wrong, which I suspected when I saw the total but she waived me off. I double-checked my food at the second window and it was indeed wrong so I spoke  with a different manager, she said she would fix the order and "charge me the difference" but she overcharged me by approximately 40 cents. So then I got into an argument with another manager about how much I would have paid if the order was correct and how many cents they actually owed me.
I ended up accepting the offer of 22 cents (they tried to give me 15 first, then 20 cents, but they owed me 43 cents if I did the math right)
I now have 2 receipts which were both for wrong amounts and I will be using both to give them a bad review through their internal feedback system.
DO NOT GO HERE, THERE ARE OTHER MCDONALDS LOCATIONS CLOSE-BY!!!!</text>

< review>
The Golden Arches has been a great foundation as a start up charity work.  I myself think it ok , and especially if your in a hurry or don't have means of cooking.  But I truly like still having enough food at home.  And nothing like true guilt spending money when you do not feel that your meeting your own needs. But I still am glad it has went to teaching children and young adults customer service and the fact that their pay.check comes from those that need their service.</review>
