Little to no beans in the “bean” burritos, asked for no cheese for specific items (all items had cheese), order was missing one item completely.

Ordered 3 quesalupas. 2 chicken and 1 black bean. Chalupa shell was not fresh at all and chicken was hard like few days old. I think we should just stop coming here. Because this is the 3rd time it happened. When you get home 3-4  miles away, you don't want to come back all the way to return. If you charge full money then your food should be fresh.</Review>

The staff here is always so kind and welcoming. On multiple occasions staff members have gone out of their way for my family and I , making sure we left happy ( which we always do) Seriously though everyone there should get a raise or a bonus because they are all amazing employees and I will continue to go there any time I am craving taco bell. Their food is bomb as f*** as well.<//text>

Always someone friendly in the drive thru, place is fast and friendly for most part. Only issue is they kinda skimp you on your meats when they are busy. Usually have no issues when I go through mobile app but do when I order in person.</text>

Every time we order food from the Shaw/Peach location, whether it's 20+ or 5 items.. there's always something missing or decimated and shoved into one bag. Taco's were all broken with stale shells, burritos were leaking, chips/ cheese and gordita missing, and crunch wrap supreme was thin and tasted rotten. This location is garbage, and employees like to give attitude when you bring your order in to correct their mistake. Who ever the manager is here needs to be fired. Restaff this whole location, they don't care about their jobs, so find someone who does.< /Review>

There is a young female employ a couple days ago, who went out of her way to make sure we had everything we ordered. More than enough sauce, and even bags and drink holders to carry the food to the car with. I was honestly blown away with how much of an effort she put in to help us. She deserves 5 stars.

Unfortunately me and my wife ordered again tonight, mainly because we were so impressed with the previous employees work ethic.  However upon  entering the store I was helped by a young-ish male "shift lead" who made absolutely no effort, in any way, to make our experience pleasant, let alone barrable. We had two online orders, I explained to him that my wife had forgot to upgrade the standard medium drinks to large drinks. Before I could even finish asking to pay the difference he threw his hands in the air and said "sorry I have no control over the app there's nothing I can do."

I then offered to pay the difference so that we could upgrade the drinks and he flat out said no, then walked away when I told him I wanted to place a separate order. He ignored me, and made me wait to order until our online orders were already ready. So our food just sat there getting cold while I finally ordered, than waited another 5 more minutes for a taco and a bean burrito.

I asked if there was anyone that I could speak to about paying to upgrade the drinks and he again just said "I am the manager, there's nothing I can do." He made no effort to try to make something work. I wasn't asking for free upgrades I asked multiple times if I could pay. I hope the 40 cents that he wouldn't let me pay to upgrade our drinks was worth losing out on a faithful customers business.< /Text>

<text>For what ever reason it took 30min to get too drive up window. Speaker at this location to take orders sounds terrible.  I asked loudly and politely please plenty of sause. After finally getting my food ,I drive 15 minutes back to my house to find no dam sause in bag. Too who it may concern regarding these employees that work at taco bell, maybe instead of just handing food off to customers on a tray due to this covid  Epidemic, maybe employee should double check order is correct and that sause is in bag😠</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>Hey Taco Bell franchise owner.

Around 11:30pm on December 26th, 2020 the customer service was MONUMENTALLY horrible. It was so bad that I have been convinced to not have Taco Bell ever again.

Best estimate is it took 10-16 minutes to fill 3 orders. None of which were large, if you see this review please check the purchases, I swear they’re small.

After waiting in line for the 10-16 minute time I was frustrated but all I wanted to know was why, this recounts my conversation with whoever was working the window.

“Your total is 7.01.”

“Okay, I’ll pay by Apple Pay...what happened?”

“What do you mean?”

“We were in line for like 15 minutes, what happened?”

the gentleman working the window scoffed at my question and replied

“You can’t see the line.”

He closed the window and continued taking orders as I waited some more, he opened the window and just handed me the food and that was it.

The worst customer service experience I’ve had in any setting.< /review>< gmapID>

Four employees ignored me including the PIC.  Was asked to order on the kiosk when they did come.  Took 9 minutes to get my food after ordering(ordering involved a 5 plus minute wait) while they were slow.

They smashed my God putting it into the bag. The tables were dirty and half the floor was wet without so much of a sign.

Speed is among their 2020 goals.  Never having Taco Bell here again.<//text>

They have changed their menu which is fine but they sure don't put much meat in a crunchy taco anymore I purchased three of them and none of them had much meat in them.There was a lot of lettuce and there really wasn't much cheese either. Very disappointed for taco Bell.<//Text>

Worst place ever! Came threw there drive threw last night at 11:24! All my taco shells where broken! The beans where dried and burnt! Called to ask what I could do and the lady said bring in and we’ll replace it! Came back in to replace it all she gave me was 10 tacos! Take my order last night came out to 35$! And told me that was all she was giving back!< /Review>

My actual visit they were busy but well trained they did things in a professional manner and were well stocked up on everything taco bell offers.  The three downfalls are usually a haven for the homeless to go use the restroom so the restrooms are often dirty and nasty.  Two ever since I started going there their soda machines don't seem to work right.  Last the eating area was kinda messy.  Overall the few downsides of the trip weren't enough to prevent me from rating it as high as I did< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

THE OTHER BATHROOM WAS OBVIOUSLY OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER HOMELESS PERSON WHO NEVER CAME OUT AFTER BEING HERE FOR 30 MIN..< /Review>

Horribly slow and inaccurate service. Before yesterday I would have chopped up there inability to take a order properly to a malfunctioning speaker and microphone, but I found out that the employees and the manager are completely incompetent. Not only can they not spell my wife's name which is a common 3 letter name, but they also had trouble spelling the very common Mike. The interior was of the restaurant was disgusting and poorly managed. I will now always go out of my way to avoid going to this Taco Bell. I'm willing to drive the extra miles just to avoid this one Taco Bell. Also No, NO I do not want your crappy cinnamon twist!!!</Review>

Sometimes as convenient as this Taco Bell might be, it is not popular enough to support the freshness and quickness at this particular location countless times I've had either stale shell or hard beans here.</text>

Ordered on the app and waited 20 minutes for one taco. Heard the staff talking about my order and they still didn't make it. No apology or anything given. Incompetent fools at this taco baco bell.

Edit:Just checked they also didn't make it supreme like I ordered so I also paid extra for nothing.< /text>

<Review>If I could give in 0 stars I would, the drive through employee was the worst racist person ever and messed up the order cause my husband had no interest in her, they need to hire someone that doesn't try to hit on every guy that comes through and is a lot better customer service.< /Review>< rate>

Very friendly place the only complaint I have about this Taco Bell is that the Brito that I ordered wasn't rolled as tight as it could have been or should've been it fell apart in the last 3 to 4 bytes and was a struggle to keep together for the last half of the burrito<//review>

Waited almost 20 min line. Could've been bad timing, could've been bad shift leader, but that was ridiculous. Finally made it to window, got my drink, and it was off. Just a bad experience unfortunately.</review>

<Time>1621740485429</Time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>Ordered the NBA party pack today. Most of the food was okay but couldn't remove items on the order. I was excited about the twists but they taste like chemicals. Got a coffee and tried to wash it down but it just tastes like water. I'd understand if the ice got to melt but I ordered it on the way out the door. Got two orders of the twists and both just tastes like chems so tossed them. It's taco bell tho so shouldn't have had my hopes up.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80945c5df5d2e287:0x90b814c7292e970f<//Gmap_id></record>

I have been a Mytee customer for over 5 years straight now.  I am an owner operator of a successful carpet cleaning business located in Los Angeles, Ca.
When I first started out my business I purchased a Mytee M5, and soon added an Air Hog, Air Hog Plus, T Rex, Stair wands, wands, burnisher, and many more Mytee Products.
I chose Mytee because of the looks and price point. Till this day I still use my Mytee M5 portable in my Rug Shop.  It still has the original motors in it too after all these years.
Over the 5 years I've been doing business with Mytee they have continually updated their equipment.  When they do they notify me and send me the updated parts at no cost.
Any time I've had any problems or questions Mytee has stepped up to the place and immediately remedied the situation.  Even when it was not their  fault but mine due to abuse or ignorance.
Mytee has the best customer service of any company out there that I've dealt with and I have dealt with many. Which is the reason why I am writing this review.  I noticed how some have claimed the opposite.  I can only assume the posters have ulterior motives.  Because if anything, Mytee is all about customer service.  No one can hold a candle to them and that is the truth.  Thanks Mytee for the many years of great service.< /Text>

Excellent customer service!!! If I could give more stars  I would! Allison Garcia is exceptionally courteous and understanding. She resolved an issue I had. I now feel 100% confident in purchasing more Mytee equipment in the future.< /text>

<text>Been hearing a lot of noise about the new 6.6 lx vac motors so much that I decided to find out what the buzz was all about. To be honest I Couldn't ask for a better experience.Mytee may have outdid themselves on this one. This machine is amazing. Took me a little time to get used to the luxury of not having to dump and fill buckets numerous times during jobs. I'm loving the auto dump and auto filling features that's for sure.Oh! And Don't get me started on the suction. My arm is sore right now. The suction is unbelievable. There's got to be at least 40% more suction if not more. I was currently running two 3 stage vac motors and the Mytee put it to shame. No exaggeration, This thing is a beast. Last but not least.  Customer service. Mr.LaBarbera was extremely helpful. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy with our purchase. Answered any and all questions in a timely manner. Top of the line equipment. Reasonably priced, five star customer service. What more could you ask for. Got to say I'm extremely impressed. Thank you Mytee an Mr LaBarbera for everything.<//text>< pics>

Been using a mytee product for a few years now and one of the motors went bad, couldn't really find the motor I was looking for so I gave mytee a call. That's when Carmellia Haymes answer the phone and probably gave me the best customer service I've ever had over the phone. Miss Haymes didn't just help me find the motor I was looking for but went above and beyond to make sure 100% that the motor I was getting was right for my product. Thank you.</Review>

To Mytee Products,
Wanted to let You know how an service employee of yours handled
a mix up in part ordering. The Techs name is Chery LaRue.
I got the wrong gasket for My 20 year old machine. I was worried that
You would not carry the gasket anymore because the machine was so old.(It still works like a champ!) Any way Ms. Larue checked and rechecked and found the correct gasket replacement part that had changed over the years and informed Me they would ship the
part at no charge to Me. I think that is fair and a good service practice.
Its GREAT to see this kind of service. Ms. Larue did a good job
and I am grateful.
After 20 Years My Machine and Your Service are Still MYTEE !
Thanks,
Joe
EDIT:
In the end, well after My 1st review, Mytee got my money and
I never did get the right part or my money back. They sent 2 wrong parts and the customer support service is set up in such a way that you will not get your money back. Very clever.
A MYTEE RIP OFF.
I want to say it was not  for lack of trying by the service tech.
The truth is mytee has my money and I got nothing.
I wish it wasn't so.
My next Machine "Prospector PE 300"
Thanks for less than nothing.
Former Customer<//review>

<review>These machines are AWESOME and the customer service is even better!  I mistakenly ordered the wrong part for my machine, and Abigail was extremely helpful and professional.  She helped me figure out the correct part to order and then sent me the replacement for no additional charge! I will definitely continue to buy MyTee machines for all my carpet cleaning needs.</review>< pics>

I own 2 Eco 17s & an air hog. Though the products are excellent and high performing, that is not the #1 reason I have done business with them. The #1 reason is they care for their clients after purchase.
Ali Rayburn & John LaBarbera are awesome to work with. As an owner/operator, you need these allies in your corner.<//Text>

<review>Mytee's online chat was very helpful. I originally clicked on "sales" type inquiries, but in all reality my questions were more "tech supporty". Regardless their rep Clarue was very helpful and knew the two productions I was up in the air about (HP60, and 8070). I have owned a "used" Grand Prix for 8 years, and I'm not sure how old and how much time it had on it when I acquired it, but I can tell you I put hardly any $$ into the maintenance of that machine, and it in return made me lots of money detailing automotive upholstery. Products and experiences like this will keep a Mytee customer as long as I'm in this industry.</review><userid>104073178240143795349</userid></record>

Recently bought a refurbished Air Hog and just wanted to say thanks as the shipping to Canada was awesome - this is the first time I have ever had anything come this fast - the device came in less than 24 hours right to my door. Mytee in my mind has the best service and support you can have from any provider ever and this is why I will buy most of my equipment from them only. Just want to put this out there that Mytee provides better service than my own country's providers for the exact same applications and equipment.< /Review>

I had a pleasant experience working with Allison, she was very helpful and knowledgeable which is a huge plus. On 2 separate occasions, I needed replacement parts for my Extractor while under warranty and I had no issue whatsoever trying to get those parts. She made it simple and easy while also providing me with useful information on an aftermarket part that I ordered from them as well.

Great Service, which is hard to come by!</text>

I have several Mytee portables including one dating back 20 plus years ago. Their newest edition with LX vac motors have become a game changer in the industry. I’m amazed how much power these machines have. More power than an entry level truck mount at a fraction of the cost. Totally impressive !! Good job guys !! Paul</text>

<Text>Allison Garcia  was extremely helpful to me...as a distributor/dealer, it is of paramount importance to give great customer service after the sale....which is why the brick and mortar stores are hands down better to deal with than your AMAZONs or other online retailers...A customer called me with an issue, and we were able to take care of him the same day...that goes a long way...we WILL keep this customer! Thanks Ally! you are the best!</Text>< pics>

<Review>I use the mytee lite 8070 and it's an outstanding machine. I contacted mytee about an issue I was having of a noise coming from my pump and whether I needed a defoamer in my solution tank or recovery tank and they resolved the issue immediately. The noise was just my pump trying to cycle out a little sand which is what it's designed to do. Carmellia Haymes was outstanding answering my questions.< /Review>< Time>

Mytee has the best products in the carpet cleaning industry. One thing that stands out is they stand behind their products. If something is broken or is not how it's suppose to be, they fix it. I've bought a few Mytee products from stores like Jon Don, magic Wand ect. And I'm always impressed by the quality Mytee has. Highly recommend their products!</review>

There are many options when it comes to carpet cleaning and jan-san equipment. From a functionality standpoint, the differences between the products available in the marketplace are minimal. When purchasing equipment, the most important thing for me is service after the sale. In this department, Mytee simply can't be beat. It's a fact, equipment will break down. But what the manufacturer does about it is critical for a small business owner like myself. If service is important to you and you choose to purchase Mytee equipment, you won't be disappointed.<//Text>

Me and my husband David have purchased products numerous times. We bought one of the first Mytee Dry Upholstery tools and could not be happier. There have been upgrades since and John has always sent me the parts to keep me up to date with the latest and greatest. Customer service at Mytee is above and beyond!</text>

<text>Ive purchased a multitude of Mytee products to stock our companies trucks for cleaning and restoration work.  Always have received quality products, and a even more helpful support staff.

My last bigger purchase was a refurbished T-Rex unit.  After I had received it, Mytee came out with new attachments for them that I wanted to try and was sent.  They did not fit my unit as i expected, but after a quick phone call, Mytee had sent me all the replacement parts I need to make it work.

Their customer service (as well as products)  impress me as I deal with tons of companies that supply our type of business.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Purchased the T-Handle Style 1.5" Spinner Tile & Grout Cleaning Tool, new, from a local distributor.  After 1 use, had to take in for service.  After the 2nd use, it completely fell apart, conveniently after the 90 day warranty expired.  This tool didn't even last six months and only used twice.  Your products used to be high quality so what has happened that you are now selling such shoddy equipment?</review>

<Name>Spunky1995</Name><time>1550727282883<//time><rating>1<//rating><Text>I bought a MyTee Focus 1500. It arrived DOA. Also, the castor was damaged from shipping.
Customer Service said to ship it back and they would replace it with a brand new steamer.
When I opened the replacement steamer, I noticed that the castor was damaged. It donned on me that they sent me back the same steamer.
As a result, I called Customer Service And they said that they decided to repair it.
I had barely used the portable attachments when one of them broke. Customer Service Sent me a replacement, but it also broke. They said that they would send one more replacement and that would be it.
When I used the narrow steam nozzle, it stretched from the heat and shot off the handle, burning me with steam. When I called Customer Service they said that the attachments were only warranted for 90 days. As it was past 90 days, they said that they would charge me for a replacement. I told them to forget it.
This steamer has a cheap hose and flimsy attachments. The Shopping Channel sells a $90.00 steamer with the exact same hose and attachments.
Yet, this company advertised this steamer as a high end product that was quality built. Nothing could be further from the truth! The steamer is made of plastic. The floor attachment bends at the middle and will not last.
What is worse is the cost. The price was close to $1,400.00 Canadian including tax.
The problem was compounded with the lousy Customer Service.
I would highly recommend that people steer clear of this company, their inferior products and lousy customer service.<//Text>< pictures>

My first machine was a rented Mytee 1003DX Speedster, loved it. I rented it from Plan-It Rentals locally. I did so well with it that I pushed further for a truck mount. Currently I have Mytee Dry™ & SOS Tool. I really like them both. Durable, lightweight, cost effective and see through so I can see what is going on while cleaning.</text>

Recently bought LDT 3 from these guys.  The machine has a lot of features that I find very useful for my business, however almost immediately I ran into a large problem.  The extractor has an auto fill feature.  You can connect a hose to the machine and it will automatically fill the fresh water tank.  The first time I used this feature one of the internal hoses that Mytee installed blew apart.  I have pictures to prove it.  I understand that things can happen during fabrication, but this was pretty bad.  It got all of the components inside the machine soaked with water.

I took the machine back to the distributor to get fixed.  That was two weeks ago.  The distributor has been calling them every day to get a new hose to replace the broken one.  Mytee cannot find a part number for the hose, and is seems no one who works there is able to walk from the office to the fabrication floor, pick up a new hose and mail it.  Now they are simply inquiring the distributor's calls.

I would warn anyone who is thinking about buying a product form Mytee to seriously reconsider.  As far as I have seen they do not stand behind their products.  If something breaks or is defective you are pretty much on your own.</Text>

Worst customer service. Half the time my machine doesn't work and when I have to order parts they are slow on picking and ordering. They inflate their shipping costs (last order 1lb package was 16 dollars to ship) as if the prices of the parts I shouldn't have to constantly be replacing isn't high enough. If you can use a different company for your extractor needs.</Text>

I ordered two Detail prep centers. Which neither of them worked like they said they would. The chemical injectors the caps leaked so much that I could not get any chemical to come out. The Roto mold on one of my machines failed and destroyed one of my vacuum motors. After sending them back they tried to charge the company that I bought them from a $1200 restocking fee. I then ordered two of the Grand Prix's At a way cheaper cost of what I paid for originally. When my Grand Prix showed up I kept some of the parts from the original Detail prep centers to use on my Grand Prix's. Now it's still under a year since I have on the Grand Prix's and I have one pump that has burnt up. And another pump that continuously runs. The company that I bought them from in Omaha is no longer in business. They told me that I would have to send the pump to them at my cost I would have to install the new part even though it's under warranty. I don't feel that I should have to pay for anything. This is the second set of machines that have gone down on me in less than a year.I feel that I have been ripped off. After writing a check for $4700 and only receiving $2800 worth of equipment. Needless to say I will never ever deal with this company ever again.< /Review>

{'time': 1491329789447, 'text': 'Hi Chris or Carlton, we regret that you were not satisfied with your Mytee experience. Our goal is always to do our best to make sure our customers are happy.\n\nIn this case, our sales rep went above and beyond to work with you along side the original distributor you purchased the machines from, to try to take care of this issue. When you contacted our company and spoke with the sales rep that helped facilitate the return of the prep-centers, you did so in a non-professional manner without all the facts, and using inappropriate language. Despite this, our sales rep continued to do her best to help you.\n\nIn regards to you feeling “ripped off”, we are sorry you feel this way. However, you did not purchase from Mytee Products directly. How much you paid for the units and how much you were refunded are issues related to the company you purchased from.\n\nAgain, it is unfortunate that you were not satisfied with your experience. We wish you success in future endeavors with your business.'}</response>

Worst possible Customer Service a Distributor could receive there employee turn over is so high they have no quality control won't honor there warranties and everybody who works there except the owner and of course his cocky sons walk around on pen's and needles because there General Manager Nathan Pepper is the biggest self centered jerk !< /Review>

Visited the USSR locale. The beer is very good, very tasty! Location is clean despite being located in Soviet Russian, and I probably would go back again with some comrades. Only downside is i felt watched by Big Brother the whole time. Missed the Motherland, as well. 5/5 stars.<//review>

This place has a really no pressure feel. I showed up in casual clothes and didn't feel a tad but out of place. Although they, like many, are getting yanked around by the ever changing Covid regulations, the staff was extremely friendly. The outside patio is so lovely and I can't wait to come back after dine in returns so I can experience the mellow, hole in a wall ambiance of the inside ❤ And to top it all off... drum roll please... the bathroom was clean! A must return.
If it's helpful to know, as of July 7th 2020 I was able to order food to be delivered from Burger Bench, masks were required when moving about, no inside seating but patio and out front seating ✌🏽< /Text>

Both the main room and their back patio are cozy and intimate. Good beer list. Their $4 beer before 7pm deal is fantastic as well.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>This is an interesting brewery/taproom. Small interior is an understatement as well as quality of brews. Staff on a late Saturday night was extremely nice and personable.
For a cool night these Californians huddled in the main room (warmth) but us Minnesotans were just fine in their makeshift patio area. One restroom but fits for this size of a brewery/taproom.
Not all brews were available (as listed on website) but from the Helldiver West Coast IPA, kilroy Red Ale, P.O.W unfiltered IPA & Hoperation Overlord IIPA we had a great time.</Review>< pictures>

I am a patient here and I LOVE this place. It is new, clean, and the doctor who sees me is amazing. I know they are training doctors but I feel that Dr. whang is already better than any doctor I’ve seen in the past 10 years. He is so polite, professional, genuinely concerned, listens to everything I have to say, he takes his time... I can go and on . After I see him, I guess the supervising doctor comes in as well to go through what the training doctor already went through with me so it’s like I’m being seen by TWO DOCTORS. It’s amazing! I feel completely and thoroughly taken care of. Thank god I found this place with SAC health, and I do not miss Dignity Health AT ALL.<//text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>I went in for a filling on March 16 ,2021 for my lower back tooth. During the procedure Dr Shakespeare was talking to his assistant the entire time. About none and work related issues. When I tried to floss in between my teeth I was not able to. So I made a appointment to be seen March 19 ,2021. My appointment was scheduled at 7:15 I arrived on time. The dental assistant did my x rays  in a timely manner. However, I was not seen by the doctor till 7:50. Once Dr Shakespeare looked at my x-rays  he doubted anything was wrong. I told Dr that I felt a sharp pain in between my teeth. So he proceeded to use a mental strip to attempt to create a opening in between. The problem is that didn't work,  so he used a drill.  He stated it wouldn't cause pain but it did! His excuse for it being painful was that water function on the drill was on. I told Dr to numb my mouth before proceeding to drill in between my teeth. Dr Shakespeare then told me he didn't have time and that he had other patients. He also said that my appointment was only scheduled for 15 minutes. And that If I wanted to be numb I would have to come in for another appointment. I told him that he need to finish the job because I was in pain. He finally decided to numb me.  And  did not return back in 5 minutes like I was told. So I went to the receptionist, and told her my situation. I was sent back again,  and  Dr fixed it so now I can floss. ALTHOUGH AT THE END OF MY TREATMENT HE MADE A COMMENT. ABOUT CHICKEN AND BEEF GETTING STUCK IN BETWEEN MY TEETH. AND HE PUT EMPHASIS ON THE CHICKEN PART! OVERALL, DR SHAKESPEARE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD DENTIST BUT HE IS NOT HE RUSHES DURING DENTAL TREATMENT. AND HE ACTS AS IF HE DOES NOT HAVE TIME FOR HIS PATIENT'S.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I'm unable to eat much at all most definitely unable to eat a healthy diet fruit/veg because they removed most all my lower side teeth. I loved my jaw line I never would have agreed to it but I was told in order for ins to cover a lower partial I have to agree to extract them. But they lied, I cant eat and now have premature aging from severe bone loss, and they still are trying to make me pay for the partial at my nxt appointment 9th over 400.
I cant look at myself or take pics go out I WANT TO DIE. I feel they owe me a full set of implants for this epic lie that was done to me.<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>My only issue is when calling to either schedule an appointment or speak with a nurse.  I'm always on hold for an hour+, longest I've been on hold was 2 hours before hanging up and making the trip down to the clinic.  Even after going out of my way to speak to the front desk in person (ONGYN department) the woman told me she was leaving for the day (4pm) and was unable to help me.  Other than the RIDICULOUS waiting times I've had no other issues.  Everyone for the most part is polite and helpful.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I want to say a HUGE Thank you to Marvin the nurse in family medicine ! He was a huge help in resolving my problem with a prescription with my pharmacy! They were able to locate it in their office after calling a few times thanks to Marvin!  Without the amazing customer service I would have felt so lost! What an amazing staff!!! Thanks so much Marvin!</Text>< pics>

<review>The clinic is beautiful and huge. I went to gynecology and saw Dr. Pruitt she is hands down the best OB doctor. She is caring and knows how to explain all the medical stuff really well. I never feel rushed and she is  very attentive with her patients. If you need an OB I definitely would recommend her 1,000% And if you have my chart the app she responds very quickly! It’s like texting your doctor!</review>< Pictures>

Very difficult to get an appointment.
Send message to Doctor and never get a response.
I’ve tried to place a complaint various times and phone just rings or it says voicemail full, or the one time they answered - they never called me back like they said they would.</Text>

< Review>
When Medical Professional Agency asked me to interview and work for Sac Health System. I felt blessed and honored to take a role here. Especially after hearing about their mission statement and vision. But it broke my heart after 2x they didn’t want to accept me because the agency that I was working under got me in a huge misunderstanding and miscommunication with SAC. SAC threw me under the bus and didn’t want to accept me even after I spoke to Chris Bryd (I believe that’s the HR manager there) regarding the situation and if I can finally start my first day there. SAC reached out to Medical Professional agency and told them that I need to stop contacting them and they no longer want me to work there when it wasn’t even my fault. Wow, great “mission and vision” statement saying on there website “SAC Health System is committed to reflect the healing ministry & love of Jesus Christ through healthcare, education, and partnerships that empower our communities to flourish. They didn’t even give me a second chance or at least hear me out. Jazzel who was suppose to start on my first day paperwork ignored and forward my calls. She didn’t even let me have a chance to speak on my behalf how the agency screwed me over. Thank you for letting me down and whoever else is next to even take a position there when it’s not even the fault of the candidate, ITS THE AGENCY YOU WORK WITH THATS MESSING EVERYTHING UP!!! So sad and heartbreaking.< /Review>

The facility seems professional but if you have any complications with your situation expect zero help or effort from the carefree employees or nurses. Everyone politely treats you as if you are not their problem, you will get no help resolving anything, they will give you the run around, transfer you to someone else’s voicemail, you will never get a call back. Just awful to have a medical clinic care so little about people< /Text>

Tried for 12 months to get my daughter in to the neurologist. Have gotten nothing but excuses and run around for why we can’t see a doctor. Finally get the ok to schedule an appointment after filing multiple complaints, and they won’t schedule because they’re booked solid for the next 4 months. If you care about your family members take them somewhere else. Filing a complaint with the medical board, these people should be shut down.< /Review>

Update, after calling the third time because 2nd time said they were in a meeting, a lady answered and was very rude and seemed almost frustrated. My wife stayed hopeful just for the lady to tell her nothing of help. She kept getting mad because she couldn’t hear my wife due to problems and interference on there end.

Word of advise, please don’t be rude over the phone.<//Text>< Pics>

I’m also being treated in family medience instead of the ob department nobody has any real knowledge of pregnancy in this and it’s so aggravating my drs stress me out more than anything else.

It's so bad experience ... calling many times to set up an appointment waiting 2 weeks as they said then call again they transfer me to another department then wait on line for someone to answer they hang up the line then call again and wait on line then repeat the what i explained earlier then ask for supervisor who didn't answer either ... its just a matter of wasting time with them just make my self a favor and look for some other speciality doctors away from them. One star is even too much for them<//Text>

<Review>I would like to share my experiences and how great this place is . I've been here multiple times, I normally hate the doctors I always avoid going but this place has made me feel so comfortable.  All the staff has been super friendly. The  check in is fast and the wait has never been longer than 15 minutes to be seen. My doctor referred me to doctor Wongworat  hand specialist.  Overall I'm so happy with all the treatment.  A huge thanks to everyone here.<//Review>< Pictures>

Nurses and doctors are always on time to see me and my baby. Whenever I have questions the doctors are there to help and they always  tell me ahead of time what needs to be done on my next visit at the end of my appointment. Plus the clinic inside are always clean and the security guys are always greeting people and are happy to give people water.

P.S. Everyone in the facility are very friendly and polite and they make me feel very comfortable at all of my appointments.< /review>

Poor scheduling. More often then not I have scheduled an appointment only to be told i need to make another appointment days before my scheduled appointment. Only to wait weeks later. Everyone is polite enough but hardly concerned. Changing doctors due to it.<//Text>

The customer service skills are terrible. I got to the back to be seen and everyone was rude . Cutting me off while talking, being extremely mean. The doctors I’ve met are pretty nice. Was able to treat me as needed .<//text>

<review>Please read all .....******!!!!!!  I’m six weeks pregnant and last week I called and they gave me such a hard time to get an appointment for the ob. This receptionist named Carolina was so rude. And she kept hanging up on me. I had bad reception so I said give me a moment to get better signal and she just hung up. I called back and told her “ hello I was just on the phone and someone hung up on me” she said oh your the pregnant woman who wants an appointment right, well I couldn’t hear you and if I can’t hear you I’m not going to stay on the call. So immediately I was mad. And she would give me the run around. I have straight medical and on April 1 will have iehp and she said “we don’t except just straight medical so their for cant make you and appointment” so I called three other times to see maybe I’ll get another person on the phone and nope her again. But then I called and finally got someone else and she told me the same thing. So I called IEHP told them of how rude they were treating me and told them about them not excepting my straight medical and they told me their filing a report because they should except it and that made me very happy. I called yesterday and told them I put a complaint and all of a sudden an appointment opened up real quick and that’s not even a good thing because it’s with a primary doctor I need to see a ob. The receptionist said we need to confirm pregnancy and I told her I went to the hospital for pain and bloating in my stomach and they told me I’m 6 weeks pregnant and need to see my doctor. And she still said we need to confirm pregnancy. Im six and a half weeks pregnant I need to check on my baby don’t they understand their is a life growing inside me a baby I wanna check on. Make sure it’s okay. But just FYI to all my bad reviews. if you have IEHP please call the and complain for the bad job the receptionist are doing. This should not be a way to treat a pregnant woman. If they don’t like their jobs they should not be working there. I’m just so mad and disappointed with the service. My pediatrician for my two other angels never gives me this problem it’s probably just the ob/gym office.

Ps someone get back to me because I know their is a higher power then these so called receptionist they have working for them in the ob office. I will be calling IEHP once again on Monday to update them on this horrible treatment and I’ll be looking for another doctors office.< /review>< pics>

<text>The worst place I have ever dealt with. By the time they let you have an OB appt you’re in the second trimester of pregnancy.

<Review>Big waste of my time, I'm 13 weeks pregnant the fact that the ob gyn section gave me the the run around, told me to go to family practice first to prove im PREGNANT. Then got to the obgyn section only so they do the SAME test to prove I'm pregnant AGAIN. Which makes no sense cuz THEY told me to go to family practice side to get tested. So I pay 40 dollar co pay just so they can check my vitals, not show me my baby's ultrasound or heart beat. Family practice side did an ultrasound, but told me " sorry my batteries are low on this monitor can't print out a picture  I am an employee at Loma Linda & I'm in disbelief & so disappointed in this office.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c35333bcd37f91:0x8498a434d73522e1<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Scheduling appointments is a headache! Your either put on hold for long periods at a time or they don't pick up. Your told they are full for the following month and to call back 2 weeks before month is over to schedule the next month and when you do they tell you they are full again...in other words,  good luck!</review>< Name>

<Text>Such horrible receptionist i had called twice today 2 get seen sooner because my primary doctor told me too since i am 28 weeks pregnant and have a historia of preclampsia well my primary doctor was concern about my blood pressure and also diagnosed me with asthma i explained it to the receptionist and they were no help at all. Apart from that the doctors are very understanding and kind and listened so its dissapointing to see how the receptions are . By the way this was for my ob/gyn.</Text>< pictures>

<rate>4<//rate><review>My son and I currently go to the Sac Health clinic on G st. It is very professional and super clean. (That counts a lot) The doctors are very attentive and show interest in my son and I. They take the time to answer all the questions I have and come back with a solution for any issue I have. What I also like is that they have their own pharmacy in the facility. Which is amazing because dealing with other pharmacys has been such a hassle for me. The only problem I could say I have is the waiting time once your in the patient room. I have been there sometimes for about 2 or 3 hours, but I also keep in mind that it is a teaching facility and the medical students have to run everything past the attending and make their assessments with the attending. Other than that, whenever I need a referall or an ultrasound they handle all of that for me, and just give me a call when all is in order. I've had a good experience with them so far. All in all I love the care they provide.</review>< Pictures>

I've read both good and bad reviews about SAC and their staff/doctor's and it sucks to read the negative ones because I have been fortunate enough to have nothing but positive comments. Their staff and doctor Perry have been nothing but helpful to me. I hope the people who has had a bad experience will soon experience a good one and change their mind regarding their staff.< /Review>

The only reason why i give them 3 stars is because of the appointments. I keep calling to schedule an appointment for my kids and never have anything available. Now not even same day visit. I told one of the girls i needed an appt and since they didn’t have any her answer was “ if you may consider switching to another clinic” if i wanted to switch i would. I love the drs. And the clinic is good because of the drs not the receptionist. I love the place not receptionist. And like i said your child is sick just go to an ER or Urgent care here they won’t get you in. I don’t understand why they are overbooking so ridiculous. Hope they fix that.</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>OK, not a good place to be. They are very unorganized. One doctor says one thing the other says another, who can you trust ? They have had plenty of time to correct their issues. So at this point and time they are unorganized on purpose and who knows how long this has been going on. Other people have notice that they are unorganized. For me how hard is to to just READ a patient's medical record? How hard is it to scan the medical records into the computer ? And if the computer is not working FIX the problem. When a medical staff cannot be on the same level of understanding this is DANGEROUS and can harm the patient. I am going to REPORT them to the medical authorities because NO ONE is gonna play with my health and just get a way with it. I had a doctor who cause me pain by injuring me at this SAC , long story short Now I have another doctor who is just clueless and this clueless may not be her fault if someone did not put it into the medical record BEFORE she know about my current situation. Dude to my current situation i cannot just leave now, BUT after my medical situation is over I am leaving. Seems like this place is getting worse and worse. There ER is bad, There Gyno is bad and even this SAC clinic is not all that great is all part of the Loma Linda System. Different locations BUT same Loma Linda System. Some people in this system may be nice people, but please avoid this place to save your life.< /text>< Pictures>

For the obgyn they Never get back to you, there always overbooked and make appointments too far out. The staff acts like they don't know how it is to have kids and make horrible comments and are verry rude. I got an apt to see the doctor for the first time mind you ill already 14 weeks when I finely get to go in and see a doctor.  Some care this place has.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>The short time I've been going to the clinic has been a great experience so far. Staff is prompt , and always nice, and helpful. They refered me to a specialist for my gullbladder  surgery, and I didn't care for the first one, so they were happy to try another. Well I just had my surgery on Dec.15, 2018, and now recovering, with my family helping me get well, thank God. It's been a while sence I've been to the clinic, because I had to wait a couple of months to get my surgery after switching surgeons , because the new surgeon was on vacation when I scheduled my appointment with him. Tomorrow morning I will be getting an appointment as soon as poss., because I have ran out of my pain medication, and the surgeon is out of town again, and I really need them. Only because when they were doing my surgery they had some issues and had to cut me all the way open, just got staples out today, and happy about that, and scared because I didn't think it was time to take them out. I will close on that, and just say the Sac clinic is a good clean always, nice staff and doctors, as well as their referrals to other doctors, a blessing all the way around. Thanks Sac clinic for careing.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I am giving them 1 star, due to the fact that the office is probably the nicest and cleanest doctor's office in all of San Bernardino. I would give zero stars, if I could, for quality of care.  First off, the appointment staff is very rude and unprofessional. Some of the nurses at the office need an attitude adjustment. Some, not all! The doctor that I saw made me feel like I had to choose which one of my disorders did I want treated. My asthma, my pain or my anxiety? Um, how about treating them all?... And if you couldn't, why not refer me to someone/people who could? I was supposed to have a lung function test and was told by the rude check out clerk, I COULD NOT come back until it was done. I called my insurance company two weeks after my appointment and found out NO authorization was ever submitted, and this was a week and a half before my next scheduled appointment! Bottom line, this office and especially Dr. Lucas, need a LOT of help and professional training. Just because you have a nice office, doesn't mean you can skimp out on quality of care.

UPDATE:
I gave them another chance to help me.
First of all, I got my authorization for my lung function test, AFTER I wrote my first review. Coincidence? Probably not. . .
I had a chest x ray done and had to wait a week to get my results. When I requested the results through their portal, as they suggest, my initial request was ignored. I had to send FIVE messages, to two different doctors, before they responded. Well, when I went back to their office I was seen by another doctor at the clinic. After waiting over an hour and a half to be seen, I explained my health issues to the new doc, a med student and the attending doctor. I had a better experience this time, with regards to the new doctor. However, I was told I needed to go back the following week for a follow up. This time, I waited less than 15 mins to be seen. I explained to the doctor that the side effects of the medication she gave me for my asthma, were horrible. I had bone/joint pain, extreme fatigue, it exacerbated my asthma symptoms and caused me severe pain. I was told by another attending doctor, "I don't think you have given the medication enough time to work. You should stay on it". WHAT!? They completely disregarded my issues with the medicine. Oh and they initially tried to convince me that my asthma was in fact my anxiety. WRONG! When they finally did their job, they listened to my lungs, and heard me wheezing. To top it all off, they sent medications to my pharmacy, that I had already told them I could not take, and blamed it on the pharmacy for filling them, and ME for picking them up! I reached out to their "customer service", several times to discuss my complaints, and have yet to receive a response.  I have switched doctors and notified my insurance of their practices. Enough is enough!

P.s. whoever is giving the responses to the reviews, if you could have someone follow up, that would be great, since I can never seem to get anyone to contact me. I used your website, emailed through yelp and have called several times. NO ANSWER!</text>

<Text>I was seen back in October of 2016 and was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. That same day I went to have my lab work done in the same facility and 2 weeks later I went back in for my results. Dr. Perry notified me that all my blood work had been lost EXCEPT for my Vitamin D results. She told me I have a Vitamin D Deficiency and was prescribed me Vitamin D2 50,000 UI One Capsule Once A Week for the Next 8 Weeks. After the first dose, I had an over dose and was in the Emergency Room. I was suppose to be given a supplement along with the Vitamin D2 Prescription. As a result of the over dose I now have Liver Damage and My Vitamin D Deficiency continues to drop even lower. I have tried numerous times to get in contact with Dr. Perry and Dr. Woodruff ( who signed off on Prescription) to discuss this issue. I left a message with the receptionist and did not receive a call back until March of 2017 (5 Months Later).</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm a first time patient and parent, this is all still new to me but this place seems to not care about me or my baby considering I'm about 16wks and I've still yet to see anyone, I thought this was important but they just give me the run around, and twice already they messed up on my appointment because they never put one in, so they had to cancel and reschedule for a very important appt.

Since when does a cardiologist not perform a stress test or echocardiogram? I could not get an appointment until they received these results. Ridiculous!!< /Review>

< review>
Two years ago Ay Caramba was 5+ stars but recently (last two orders), the food has been mediocre & the service unprofessional. My most current visit went like this: placed order, waitress says, “ready in 15-min”, ok I’ll be back, I returned in 15min, waitress asked me, “what did you order?” I give her my order, thinking she wants to give me the correct order, not the case, she never put my order in. I called her on it, & her reply, “it doesn’t matter, your order is next now”. The topper, cook yells, “we don’t have tamales, no tamales sold around here”. Why are tamales on the menu? I’m being generous giving 3-stars; I’m hoping the place returns to the quality food & service it had. I may never find out; it’s unfortunate, it was a great place.</review>

< review>
My husband and I have very different opinions on how the meal was so ill list both

I chose the 3 stars but my husband said only 1 star.

When we got there we observed only about 3 tables being used. Im not sure if they had just finished with a rush or not but all the other open tables were still dirty. They quickly cleared one off for us. Next when we went to order drinks, we were informed that their soda fountain doesn't work. I ordered a lemonade which was good. My husband after not being able to order the soda, then tried to order a drink to which he was told would have to be asked about. He was then informed they were out of that drink as well. He settled for a bottled coke.

When we went to order food everything went well at first. I ordered a grilled Burrito, my husband a chimichanga, and we got chicken strips for our son. About the time they were bringing mine and my sons meal out the waitress comes over asking my husband what type of meat he wanted in the chimichanga after already specificying the beef chimicanga. Mind you my sons meal and my meal are now sitting on the table after we have been waiting 30 minutes and only now are they confirming the meat in my husbands meal.

So we get our food. I have no complaints on my Burrito and my son seemed to love his food since he chowed down but my husband said the chimichanga didn't taste right at all. He ended up not eating it all and instead ate the rest of our sons meal.

Service seemed a bit slow at times but overall was decent. My experience varied differently from my husbands and, while I would consider coming back, my husband has said unfortunately he WOULD NOT reccomend this place and will not come back. I'm not sure if I would highly recommend this place to my friends either. I would definitely give ample warning to be prepared to have some issues and for them to be out of things but for the food to be good at least.< /review>

I got the mole pork which was really good. This place is a small hole in a wall Mexican restaurant. Pretty small indoor seating, but they have a drive thru.< /text>

Biggest burrito I've ever had, got the Shredded Beef Wet Burrito, it was delicious, but a 1 hour wait for pick up, which you can already guess that its really worth it.</Review>

The best option in town when it comes to traditional Mexican breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes. They also happen to nail American and Continental style breakfast as well. I've cleared about half the menu, and have yet to encounter a dish that has come up short. The Head Chef is the Co-owner I believe along with the Husband who works as Host and waiter. Both of them are extremely personable and friendly and remember repeat and loyal customers. I recommend this place to anyone who even utters the word breakfast around me. Their lunch and dinner options are both delicious and more than reasonably priced. The one thing that could be construed as a down side is the size of the restaurant, but I see the small size as a pro not a con. It allows the staff to interact with their patrons on an intimate level and lends itself to the home style menu. A must visit for anyone even remotely near the Santa Clarita Valley.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLnZhhhATBPFqn-41B2VC5RhAD3K3qHWEArsQ0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c288ea0b6bf801:0x46533211f40fef30<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>This certain day I order a wet burrito, regular burrito and some fish tacos. The wet burrito which was shredded beef, beans and rice was okay not the best I had, presentation was nice looking which came with a side of some sour cream and gaucamole. The burrito itself was great definently will buy that again, the steak was well seasoned which made it bomb. Now the fish tacos were a disappointment, the fish itself was nice, good texture but the tortilla they use could be a better quality instead of 'maize' tortilla I would have like it to be flour. But if you're looking for a good quick mexican cuisine, try this spot.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c288ea0b6bf801:0x46533211f40fef30< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've been here a few times with my friends and we all love it! I've tried many Mediterranean restaurants in Orange County and this is definitely my #1. Their meat is fresh and so delicious. They have the best sliders I've ever had in my life! The staff is also very friendly and the atmosphere is great definitely coming back<//text>

Just finished my left overs. They were delicious as well. All agreed that Leslie  went above and beyond and hooked us up right. Special requests were accepted with a smile. Definitely ordering again & when all the craziness is over planning on eating at the restaurant and thanking her personally.</text>

Been waiting a few years at the table for food. I'm ready to exclaim "!ay carumba!" in surprise if the food ends up on my table sometime today... I'll add to this review if I ever get to eat anything...

*Edit*
The food did come and it was pretty good. My son and I really loved the pabil. A bit pricy, and the service was slow, but our waiter was nice. We may be back, but probably a "to go" order in the future.< /Review>

<Text>Owner is very nice and attentive. We only tried breakfast and we really liked it. It is a little pricey for the portions but not too bad. The location is pretty small and a party more than 4 will not fit very well. Most tables are meant for 2 or so people so be aware of that. There are also a few covered tables outside which is nice! Overall, a good intimate spot with a large menu.</Text>< Pictures>

Decent food... the first I was there, the service and food were really good. Made me feel like a guest in their home. The second time, was decent for and okay service. Third time there, service wasn’t really there. Not sure what happened.  If they repeat the food and service of my first visit ... would go there much more often.</text>

Stopped on our drive through California for breakfast. Food was great and service was friendly. Not super fast, but not too slow. Glad we stopped. And we always like a restaurant that serves breakfast all day. We made a quick visit to this great restaurant solely based on the reviews we read online. The food was excellent and the service was even better. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone craving a good meal in the Santa Clarita area. Went for an early dinner for good Mexican food. Both of us delighted with the food. Seating a little cramped but overall experience for unique Zmexican food well worth the $. Will return.< /review>

<Date>1557584784462<//Date><review>To look at the place as you drive up, you think, "Why did I pick this one?" It's small with limited seating both inside and out. But, believe me, it's a "must try!" kind of place. Family owned and operated. I had the special of the day, Birria. Amazing! I'll be back and soon! I love this place, family owned. Across the street from Costco in canyon county. Best food..I had a veggie omelette and my husband had a shrimp omelette. A must!! Everything is Wonderful.. we go at least 3 month.Small restaurant but well worth it.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
The Mexican food and fish were good. My wife didn't care for the Buffalo wings. Sports bar like setting with lots of televisions. It's an open restaurant that sits a few feet above street level. The bill for six people with either a beer or delicious fresh fruit drink was $63.00 with the 10% servicio (tip) included. In all, a nice place for dinner.< /Review>

The food and service are outstanding. Friendly place and great service. The soups are made daily and on weekends they have menudo. Carnitas are super tasty.  Ay Calamba does not have a full liquor license, but they serve beer and wine.  They make sangria from scratch, which is delicious. If you are a vegetarian, there are quite a few selections and very good. Small place, but the food is really great.<//Text>

<Review>As the last reviewer stated, at first you don't expect much from its location. However, this turned out to be one one the best Mexican meals I've had outside of Mexico itself. Parking is very easy and the restaurant sits about 30 or so. The manager is very friendly and is concerned about how you like your meal. I had the cochinito pibil (a specialty from the Yucatan) for about $11. The taste was excellent and it came with the standard-beans, Spanish rice, and tortillas. I will certainly be back again and again.<//Review>< user_id>

A friend recommended we go here. I am happy we did. Tiny family owned business. The service is amazing. Everyone was very nice. The food was tasty. I am going to come back and try some other items on the menu. I waddled out from being full. Out food didn't take very long. The time was very reasonable, considering it was made fresh to order. I will be back<//review>

<text>I have a new favorite place to eat in Santa Clarita. I was impressed by the decor when I first walked in the door. Very creative use of space and nicely decorated interior. I moved to the patio as it was very nicely appointed as well. The staff was very friendly and I felt comfortable immediately. The service is outstanding and when our meals came I was very pleasantly surprised. Delicious food served in beautiful white dishes. The presentation of the food matched the flavor and I am now hooked on this restaurant. I am very particular about Menudo and this was the best I ever had, fresh, hot and flavorful. The chicken mole, which is prepared with a tender breast and delicious sauce was a work of art. Try the desserts, you won't be disappointed. This was my first visit and I am looking forward to working my way through the menu. The owners are very friendly and charming. Give this place a try if you are tired of factory food. Dining should be an experience and this place does not disappoint.</text><rate>5<//rate>< Time>

< review>
We decided with over 400 restaurants in the Santa Clarita Valley, we needed to start spreading our wings and start trying more of them. So we picked Ay Caramba! based on the favorable Trip Advisor reviews. Wow! What a find!! We went for a late lunch/early dinner at 2:30 p.m. and had the place all to ourselves. The owner and his wife (I assume it was his wife since this is a family owned and operator restaurant) were both very charming and amiable. We had fun conversing with them and they delighted in our raving over the excellent food. I feel so bad for my regular Mexican food haunts as they will be seeing less of me as I come back to Ay Caramba! to try more of their dishes. Today I had the Pipian made with a rather huge chicken breast.< /review>

<text>Excellent food, fast, attentive and friendly service. They offer an extensive menu that we look forward to trying in subsequent visits.  My husband was very happy with the fish tacos; very generous portion and the pickled onion on top was a great touch.  At $12.50 it's a very good value.  I had the veggie burrito which was also excellent; filled with a nice variety of vegetables including beans and rice and topped with a delicious salsa verde.  Also an excellent value for $10.50.  It wouldn't surprise me if they outgrow their current location!</text>< Rate>

Small, out of the way, amazing food, and when the mood strikes, a floor show. The owners are wonderful, she is the chef and he runs the front of the house, he is hilarious, but you have to pay close attention. Always makes my day to eat a meal there.< /text>

Been here several times now. Food is good but I feel that sometimes the service is a little slow. It's a small place and there is usually only two servers. Other than that, it's good food which is why I come back.</Review>

First time here, very small and the bathroom is located on the outside, but, the food was amazing, the atmosphere was relaxing and the service was prompt and courteous. Leslie, our server, was so friendly and professional and was very knowledgeable of the menu, she should be given a raise. I highly recommend Ay carramba at Princessa, in Santa Clarita.< /Text>

Small place with lots of Goodness. We ate outside, It is very beautifully decorated and feels homie. You can hear the water fountain in the background and feel the breeze as you enjoy your amazing food.

Mexican food on point. We had four dishes served. Everything from the Waitress attending to us, to the food was perfect!

My girlfriend had the Chicken enchiladas, and she enjoy how delicious and good it was.
She also had the Shreded Beef Mojado Burrito .. and she said the sauce on it was perfect.. not spicy but good and perfect.

4 star for the food.
Had the Grilled Steak Burrito and it was delightful and big.

The location is small but has a lot of charm.. it is kinda of hidden but it adds to the beauty. Place is clean, everyone is plateful and caring to give you a good service.

Will come back many times more  and I highly recommend it to anyone with some serious Mexican Munchies!< /review>

The perfect ending to my 40th birthday. Dinner with my family at Ay Caramba! The food is so good and the owners were so fun and friendly!

————————————————-
Update Oct 2019
* * * * *

Since I can’t leave a 2nd review, I posted 5 “stars” above. My wife and I came for dinner the other night. A date! An actual date without kids! We sat outside and at chips and salsa and bean dip. Our server was great and offered some great recommendations. My wife had the steak fajitas and I had the chili verde. So good! We will keep coming back and keep posting updates!</Text>

This restaurant is a little small, looks like it used to be a take-out place that was converted.
I think what keeps the food in this place so consistently good is that the owners (absolutely beautiful people) are very much involved.

<Review>Excellent food doesn't even begin to describe Ay Caramba. Super flavorful, super service, and super friendly. Yup, you couldn't ask for more from a Mexican restaurant. The horchata is homemade and sensational. Not just combos but true Mexican dishes. Muy gourmet, muy superbo.< /Review>< pictures>

Two main ingredients for a great dining experience, tasty authentic food and wonderful service. Aye Caramba has them both. They have a diverse menu with hard to find Mexican main dishes, fantastic soups with a bit of Cuban flair. Aside from letting our secret out, this is the best the Santa Clarita Valley has to offer.</review>

<text>They have good food, but I have never had a good experience with the service. Today they brought out a chicken burrito when we ordered steak. And my consome de pollo was brought out without tortillas, even though the server asked if I wanted corn or flour when I was ordering. We asked for chips and they said they only had chips from the night before and that they didn't want to give us bad chips. The other table was served chips.</text>< Rate>

Been there since they first opened. Great delicious and healthy cuisine.Recommended the place all around town.Best reviews are from my other highly reviewed restaurant owners who have tried it and also give Ay Caramba excellent praise. Alberto and Maggie are so hospitable and accommodating.
So glad others have discovered this gem of a place.</Review>

Walked in on a Sunday on a whim, and was greeted by (I'm assuming) the owner. Super friendly, and checked on us often. My husband and I are eating low carb, so we ordered the stuffed jalapeños and menudo and pozole. The broth in both was delicious. Lots of meat, and a sizable plate of toppings. Great little gem in the area.</review>

I live in Australia but visit LA each year, not only is Ay Caramba! My first stopping point for my vacation, but probably my most frequently visited for the duration of my stay.. I can't wait until I go back, superb food complimented by a fantastic team working there - I'm glad I accidentally came across this place!<//Text>

Small place with lots of Goodness. We ate outside, It is beautifully decorated and feels homie. You can hear the water fountain in the background and feel the breeze as you enjoy your amazing food.

Mexican food on point. We had four dishes served. Everything from the Waitress attending to us, to the food was perfect!

5 star for the food.
Had the Grilled Steak Burrito and it was delightful and big.
Also had The Fajitas .. and OMG! Delicious!

My girlfriend had the Chicken enchiladas, and she enjoy how delicious and good it was.
She also had the Shreded Beef Mojado Burrito .. and she said the sauce on it was perfect.. not spicy but good and perfect.

The location is small but has a lot of charm.. it is kinda of hidden but it adds to the beauty. Place is clean, everyone is politeful and caring to give you a good service.

Will come back many times more  and I highly recommend it to anyone with some serious Mexican Munchies!</review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I ordered takeout from this place today and was extremely dissapointed. I ordered the taco, enchalada combo plate and my husband ordered the 2 taco combo plate. All I can say is it was the most bland mexican food I have ever had. Not one thing was good. The beans are out of a can...the meat flavorless and the salsa is like water. Very expensive...and they didn't even give chips with the order. They even tried to charge us too much by adding food that we didn't order. The great reviews on here must be from friends and family of the owners, because I am giving it a huge thumbs down. 👎< /text>< Pictures>

I can't understand why there is such high ratings for this place. Seriously? The food was terrible. My wife's waffle was burnt, the potatoes were dry. To top it off the A/C wasnt working, come on in July when its 100'. Too over priced for mediocre food.<//review>

It's clean,  the owners are very welcoming and sincere, and the food was delicious!  Quality food at a reasonable price... I tried the Lonche Ay Caramba, best sandwich I've had, the pork was tender and the red sauce was tasty. 👍👍< /text>

We just happened to be passing through on our way home from the the La Brea tar pits. We just came upon this place via a Google map search. The food was great and the service was awesome. On will say we almost left because it's veey tiny and on a Sunday evening the shopping center was dead. It was amazing though. If we were a little closer we would come alot.... But anytime we want mexican food in this area we will come here!< /text>

Pros: quick seating. Good service. Friendly staff. Lots of parking. Cons: Small space. Bathroom not in main area. Food: breakfast burrito(bacon), azteca sopa, Nutella banana crepe, and huevos rancheros. Soup was good but could have used more fillings(tortilla strips, cheese, avocado, etc). Thumbs up for the crepes. Was a nice way to share a dessert and end the meal. Huevos rancheros wasn't what I was expecting.. The tortillas aren't friend so you didn't get that crunch in the bite so it wasn't my cup of tea. Not bad... Just not good. Burrito was ok... Just a burrito.

They put pico de gallo in there so if you don't want that you'll have to let them know. No salsa was offered and everything is mild (even what they say is spicy on menu) so ask them for spicier sauce if you like spicy. If you're looking for dirty authentic Mexican this won't be the spot for you. If you want clean mild sit down Mexican then this is a great spot for you!<//Review>

I am in love with the owners of this business (Albert & Maggie)! They are so welcoming and good hearted people. Customer service is everything to me, and they have that nailed. Each time I visit, I leave feeling so happy. They have so much passion in what they do and genuinely care.

Simply irresistible... my exact thought as I took my first bite of the recommended Chile en Nogada. OMG!

I am not even exaggerating,  this is the best dish I have ever tired and is now my favorite food dish! Each bite literally melted in my mouth. It was sweet, it was salty (the good kind), it was slightly spicy... I can't even describe. If I wasn't being watched I would've licked the sauce off my plate lol. Just try it please.

So me and my love went back for dinner. I ordered the Pozole, he ordered a burrito with shredded beef.

The Pozole was presented in a HUGE bowl with all the extra goodies on the side: shredded lettuce, chopped onions, sliced radishes, lime wedge and crunchy tortillas. I love Pozole sooo much, just so comforting. But I haven't had it in a while because I never order from restaurants, has to be homemade with love. While Ay Caramba's Pozole is exactly that! So thankful for the big serving so I could take the rest home to enjoy later.

My man loves burritos and is super picky too! He typically doesn't get the shredded beef because he has had bad experiences with it being too chewy and too much fat. While that was not a problem this time. It was topped with red sauce and cheese but it was not a messy wet burrito. It had just the right amount for each bite. With each bite he kept talking to himself about how good it was! By the time I  had a chance to take a picture of our meal, his burrito was practically gone (see pic lol).

I also had several cups of horchata. I grew up with my grandma making me "rice water" as I called it. There's is just as yummy!

I highly recommend!!!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a Mexican Restaurant and they are all family, but the thing I liked the most was their food and their good treatment, the owner and his wife, very nice people and deal with their clients and visitors, they deserve no 5 stars 10 is what They deserve it. I recommend it to everyone in general.

Friendly and helpful staff and regulars alike, inventive beers with consistently high quality, lots of games, spacious and open decor, and an outside area.

< Review>
I love Alosta Brewing.  I first found out about them when I was a volunteer serving their beer at my church’s annual festival.  I am now a regular and even joined their “mug club” this year.  My wife and I, along with our friends, are semi-regulars for trivia night on Thursday’s.  Fun place, great atmosphere.< /Review>

<Text>Located in a business park like many other breweries it is a nice setting. There is both indoor and outdoor seating and plenty of room. The staff were helpful and the beers were pretty good. they do not serve food but have food trucks come in frequently. prices were a little bit above average seven or eight dollars for most beers.< /Text>< pictures>

Staff were helpful and passionate. Beer, however, was average. They have a large variety, but nothing really shined. Everything also tasted under-carbonated.< /review>

It's the type of business you'd want to go to.

The people are friendly and the beer is great! It's not too loud even on busy days. Definitely worth joining the Mug Club Membership (bigger mug that fits more beer).< /text>

Herb has a wide palate and an even hand with the ingredients he uses. Many differing styles, all well made. The tasting room is a wide open and friendly space. You could spend hours here going through the inventory and be able to walk away from it. You'd need a DD, to be safe, but not by much.</Text>

Here's a quick reference of what they have
- Great beer
- board games
- tons of room (for larger groups)
- an outside area
- food trucks on the weekends
So if that sounds good try it out<//Review>

Beer. If you're into friends and beer, not into food or atmosphere, this is your local hangout. Not pretentious, come as you are. Grab a glass; tasters on the pricey side.<//Review>

Great place to be, greatest people to be around. Interesting and innovative crafts coming out of Covina CA. Has trivia, food trucks and games. I especially recommend trying their sours, some of which truly rank top in my all time list of must-have beers. I especially like that they don't use cheap shortcuts to get taste. They actually brew intelligently to get the flavors they want in their beer. Always love a place that brews without gimmicks. Can't wait to see what new things they roll out for the coming year. (Try their blueberry sour- if you can get it. I'd fist fight a nun in the parking lot for a drop.)

Update: a, new beer out of Alosta to recommend, one of the more interesting I've had out of the Azusa/Covina area lately, Amarillo Wild. Its a mild sour, sweet but tart, floral and refreshing, enough sugar that you can drink 2 or 3 but exemplary balance. If you like sours or beers that are light on the palate, absolutely a must-try.<//Text>

<text>I've been to many many  Churches during my lifetime and this is by far the best. It's not nearly as structured as all their the churches I've been to And the actually practice what they preach which is the perfect place for imperfect people. Pastor Adam is definitely one of the best speakers without being over the top. Every week he has an incredible message that relates not only to The Bible but to everyday real world experiences in life. If you wanna try something different and unique where you laugh and cry and you can be yourself then this is the place for you.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Name>Aidan Bourland</Name><text>Ive been serving at this church since i was 11 and its amazing being able to be a part of this big family of people and love god at a place where they welcome imperfect people. Its a place you can go even if you dont believe in god if you just want a place where people love you and you can be with supportive people. Ive heard so many people say that they didnt believe in god or any religion until they found southhills. And even if you dont believe even if you dont want anything to do with god the services still have SO much that applies to everyones life.<//text><GmapID>0x80dcc7e8fe5f12df:0xcd270d7040cce3b3< /GmapID>< rate>

This is an incredible church! The preaching, children's programs, events, and worship are all next level! They have coffee and donuts for free each Sunday. They are always doing big events where there are food trucks, bouncy houses, balloons, party goodies etc. - and these happen on a monthly basis, if not more. The congregation is very diverse too - which speaks a lot about the heart of the church - everyone is welcome and they make everyone feel valued.</Text>

Finding a church that will inspire, motivate, keep you spiritually connected in a lighter, more entertaining note is so very hard to find.  My family has been going to South Hills Church with Pastor Chris Sonksen and Pastor Adam Smith for more than 15 years now and they do just that, never fails us.  They inject humor, knowledge, practicality and relevance to each sermon leaving you spiritually envigorated after. Although we’ve moved several cities, we’ve been faithful followers.   The church has fun, great and entertaining child care facilities that it’s a win win situation for us parents and my then toddler kids.  Needless to say even without the doughnut and coffee, we hardly miss Sunday church.   Thank you Pastor Chris and Pastor Adam plus the wonderful and friendly staff.  We’ve found our place of worship here, just love it!!<//text>

Apart from that the worship is great and the pastor always has a powerful message with such a possitive and motivational insight through the word of God.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>The first time I came to South Hills, I was so far out of tune with Life, God, and family.  I had just met my now Wife and mother of my children.  I instantly felt welcome and loved the moment I stepped out of my car.  I fell in love with this church.  I sat in service and something amazing came over me.  I began to cry.  So much pain, fear, guilt was washed away from me.  I owe the many great people of South Hills so much.  Soon I became to know the now Pastor Adam who is such a great man, father, and role model.  He's truly a blessing and makes his service so much fun and so very educational.  I am so Glad we were introduced to this Church and will forever pass on the Love we have learned At South Hills.  An amazing place.  Take your family, your freinds, your loved ones.  I promise it will change your life.  God Bless You all!</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

< review>
I'm 17 years old, and I've been coming to this church on Sundays and on Tuesdays for their teen ministry (Remnant) since I was 14. They showed me who God is, and have been there for me with love, and support since day one. They've cried with me, and they've laughed with me, and everything in between. All the pastors and leaders there are world changers. This is a family. This church has helped me build a relationship with God, and it goes stronger each day. The one rule they have is no perfect people allowed.<//review>

Boba is super soft and if I get 50% sweet, just perfect! I love high mountain milk tea. Rose high mountain milk tea is pretty descent too.<//Text>

<Review>The matcha toffee milk tea is the essential item here! A strong enough matcha flavor and with the unexpected texture of the chewy/crunchy toffee bits, you don't even need to add boba because there's already so much going on. Love that they serve yummy Third Culture mochi muffins too.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80d954206d215a19:0x81fba09b3307722d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It has a nice ambience, is very spacious and looks good for hosting small parties and events.

When it comes to the menu, I've tried an assortment of drinks including the Vietnamese iced coffee and Thai iced tea. They're both very flavorful and the coffee hits with a jolt of energy (it's potent). It's also family owned. A fact that gives both it's drinks and meals their own unique, desired and consistent tastes.

All in all, the location is easily accessible with ground-level storefront parking.</Text></record>

It shares the same parking lot as Grocery Outlet so you'll need to drive into the parking lot to find the hidden tea spot.</review>< username>

<Text>This Baba places on my way home from work and it's like my guilty pleasure to go there and get a mango green tea with double boba. I mean who really needs double boba? Clearly it's me!  I am always tempted to come for a karaoke but I don't have anyone to go with. Looks like they probably have A-blast<//Text>< Response>

<text>Since this is a new joint I thought I'd trip over and investigate... The woman behind the counter was nice but gave a very puzzling explanation as to why I couldn't get a smoothie with just Durian in it, for some reason the owner thinks it doesn't taste right (???) so the only option is an Avocado/Durian mix, which doesn't sound appealing to me. I passed in favor of just Avocado. It was really good, but you're forced into buying a large pint size... for $7.50, which is a bit glass size. A bit much, IMO.

Oh well, the search continues.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This place makes me wish that there was a no star rating. Extremely nice interior with nice chairs and tables, but the service is absolute garbage. My family and I  ordered our crepes and I got the nuttella banana waffles. By the time we left we had one nutella banana strawberry waffle, a normal strawberry waffle, and two crepes. Absolute garbage, I would never go here again.<//Review>< pics>

I came here with a friend and her dogs and since we were the only customers they were nice enough to let us bring a table and chairs outside to enjoy the sun and sit with the pups! I ordered a Taro milk tea with boba and almond milk and my friend ordered the Thai Tea with boba and soy milk along with an açaí bowl! The man behind the counter was very nice and the drinks were tasty! I will definitely come here again but the location is not ideal and a little hard to find if you don’t know what you’re looking for!<//Text>

<Text>This is one of the least responsive dealerships I have ever dealt with. We have purchased five vehicles here in the past 20 years. A Ford aerostar, 3 Ford Fiestas and a Ford focus. With each one, we also purchased extended warranty and maintenance. I realized this does make us the biggest customers in the Ford corporation, but I think it does signify our loyalty as Ford customers. Every time we come for service, they give us a hassle. They claim they can't find our maintenance agreement on their computer or they tell us to make an appointment for a week later. On several occasions over the years, I have gone home to retrieve paperwork to prove I had maintenance agreement. Upon returning to the dealership, I find they somehow discovered it in their system. If this happened once, no problem, anyone can make a mistake. But it happens regularly. Today, I needed a tire replaced, which was covered by my maintenance agreement and extended warranty. The service adviser repeatedly told me I did not have the tires installed here, and I told her I don't take the car anywhere else. Not until the service manager came out and looked up the record in her office did they confirm I had purchased the tires here. I think the dealership intentionally places roadblocks in front of customers to dissuade them from getting the service they have already paid for and deserve. Only people who are willing to push them actually get the service they've paid for.
My advice: avoid this place. There are plenty of places to buy a car.< /Text><username>Michael Towne<//username><gmap_id>0x80c34ca783d3ba43:0xe99450d446163288< /gmap_id><Response>None<//Response><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

They tried to repair my a/c in my truck.
First told me it was blower motor and quoted me $800.00. I told them I replaced it already and they said they’ll replace it again and see if works, they changed it and didn’t work. They took their blower motor out and put mine back in and then said needed a whole new A/C and quoted $4,000.xx!! I declined the new A/C and they charged me $150.00 for service. The service was a waste of time and money!</Text>

<review>Horrible place to go if you have a diesel. I specifically asked for the price beforehand and they told me $160. After it was done they tell me it is $227, because my Ford diesel took 12 quarts. They only tell you that AFTER you do your oil change, where you have no choice but to pay. I will also stay away with my gas vehicles, this place is run like a scam.<//review>< username>

In addition, with my own personal experience in customer service of over 10 years, they have 5 star customer service in my honest opinion. If you want to be accommodated, handle with genuine care and a smile, go ahead and work with these two. Thanks for welcoming with kindness to Santa Maria.

Gabriel was super helpful in showing me the facility, explaining everything and offering me a bigger rental when I realized the one I reserved was a bit to small. Very pleased with his professionalism and knowledge of the store. He was confident and direct but funny and easy to talk to. Would highly recommend this place just based on him. The facility is great too.< /Review>

<Text>It was very simple to rent a storage.  Beautiful people with great service. I initially had rented a 5×10 and realized it wasn't enough. They gladly switched me to a bigger unit, very close. I'm very grateful, easy access and I love the push carts to load stuff on, way better than walking every item to the unit<//Text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Today, April 10, 2021 my husband and I rented a 10x10 storage for $90 a month.  In spite there are many storage rental facilities in and around Santa Maria, it was the Quality Customer Care and Service that we received from Managers Mona and Joe and staff Gabriel.  ENTRANCE IS KEY.  Newly opened for about 8 months, I was impressed with the well kept and cleaned facility, the office, storage units.  First impressions was what We got at StorQuest Self Storage, the process and paperwork was fast and efficient.  At the end, I rate this business a 5 Star!  Not only is our property trusted in good hands with good people, but I felt like family.  I am glad we found StorQuest, our home away from home self storage.

My rating of this Corporation I would give 5 five stars. The storQuest that I am rating, my girlfriend rents a space to store her work tools and her belongings. Evidently if you're not married your boyfriend cannot go in and rearrange, clean  your unit. I was doing just that while she was at work, and was kicked out by the owner. Where's who are very aware of my disability as an amputee and kicked me out of the property for doing just that rearranging and cleaning up. Obviously Their Manners and their behavior towards people that look like me tattooed amputee. To say the least our money can we pay for that space is not appreciated by them. And we pay our rent always on time never been late. So I say the f word to him go down the street save yourself a headache!!!!< /text>

I recently needed to rent two units here, and the management was very gracious and flexible, even though I had several delays and issues with the movers getting my belongings there.  Once I arrived with my belongings and movers, the staff was very professional and helpful, going above and beyond expectations. I would highly recommend this facility.  It is also brand new so everything is in great shape and very clean.</text>

I had a great pleasure meeting Mona & Joe at StorQuest Self Stroage. They were beyond helpful to what type of storage unit I was looking for. The place was so clean and immaculate that I knew this was a trust worthy place to store my belongings. I would recommend this place to family and friends and to especially work with Mona & Joe. Thank you for the great customer service.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I am an electrical contractor and when we needed to expand beyond our personal garage space I began the search for a locker. We checked out about a dozen different places and when we pulled up to StorQuest I had a feeling we’d be going with them.

For starters a HUGE part of our decision was the ability to easily load and unload large material. They had lockers available with 12ft + ceilings at no additional cost. This was a significant benefit from everyone else because most of our material comes in 10ft lengths and the ability to stand that material up really helped maximize our space.

Everything else about the faucility was icing on the cake. The staff is AMAZING! I like doing business with people that are honest, friendly and appreciated their customers. Everyone there checks those boxes! Everytime I see them it feels like I’ve stopped by to see friends.

The entire facility is extremely clean and the tenants I’ve encountered seem to have similar needs as us. I tend to bring my 5 year old with me and I feel very comfortable bringing him them.

I would highly recommend StorQuest to anyone in need of a locker!

<text>So, I'm about 9 months pregnant, and first time mommy and at this time all I want is to have my stuff safe and have a relabeled storage unit. It took me about 2 hours to look up all the storage units In Santa Maria area. I had to go through every review and every website to actually have a peace of mind to bin-point what storage unit I would choose. Well, finally got to see the website of StorQuest Self Storage, and I was very impressed by it and actually happy that they have an animated video to show you how big and what can fit in that storage unit you wish to get. The prices are way better than other places. There is a first-month rent for 1-dollar sale. So, in total, my bill was less than 40 dollars with other stuff I got, and the insurance included. I was able to rent out a 5x5 in minutes on the website and got a call confirming my until. I wasn't able to go in that day because of personal issues. But the next day I was able to get my storage unit and keys. It's way better than other storage's I had been in. The place was amazing inside and out. They have security cameras in and out of the place. They have other features like RV & Auto Storage, State-of-the-Art Security, Ground-Floor Units, Climate-Controlled Units, Month-to-Month Rentals, 24,7 Customer Support and much more. Nice office and very nice owner. The owners are a married couple that seem wholesome and honest people. I recommend this place. That's saying something because I know I didn't spend 2 hours on nothing. I am very happy with what I choose.</text>< pictures>

New! What else can you say? Clean premises, staff very helpful, but I don't remember a hill of any kind on Betteriva. So where did this place get one. Surprised me as I turned to go storage site and damn, low gear and UP a hill! I mean you're not going to need oxygen, but a 10' incline is a surprise! I did get a good laugh out of it though! The place is nice.<//text>

<Text>I don’t normally leave reviews but the property is very clean and secure. Not to mention the customer service is excellent!! Mona and her team was great at addressing all of my concerns. This review is subject to change based on rent increase 😀 just kidding.

<resp>None<//resp><review>I started by reserving a unit on Saturday night. Come Sunday, I got a call from Gabriel who told us to stop by if we were ready to proceed. Later that day I stopped by and was greeted by Gabriel and Mona in the front office. Gabriel was very knowledgeable and immediately offered to give a tour of the premises and unit. I was extremely happy with the location and size of my unit. The process to checkout and finalize everything didn’t take more than 15 minutes. Before I knew it I was already storing belongings. I couldn’t be happier and glad I chose this place to secure my things. They’ve got plenty of surveillance cameras so thieves beware. Highly recommend!!< /review><Date>1613969147384< /Date>< Pics>

We are those people... the house you can see from space at Christmas! Lots, and Lots of boxes of Christmas decorations.
Storquest is the best we have ever used over the years of storing our collection of decorations.
The easy access and the clean property is always a factor and they exceed the clean part.
Yes! I would and do recommend Santa Maria Storquest for your safe storage needs.
Bonus! You get Joe and Mona on top of it all, really the cherry on top with the quality of friendly yet very professional service EVERY time.
Thank you for the fabulous environment l can't say how much I appreciate you.</Review>

Plus, they have carts you can borrow to help move your things. Best of all was the very friendly and accommodating staff-Mona, Joe and Gabe! They really go the extra mile! The prices are the best in town, too! I am considering moving some items that I have in storage at another storage facility in town and getting an second unit at StorQuest.< /Text>< pictures>

This is the best storage facility I have ever seen in my entire life. From the climate controlled units to the PHENOMENAL service Mona & Joe give you the second you walk through that front door, you will not regret putting your items here. Mona & Joe really make you feel like family and treat you & your items with the upmost respect and care.

Betteravia Self Storage doesn't even come close to this property. Spend your money here at StorQuest and feel safe knowing everything will be taken care of! THE BEST OF THE BEST</Text>

I have looked at many storage facilities in Santa Maria. This is by far the nicest, cleanest and newest property in town. The staff made it super easy and fun for me to move in! I am so happy they have inside units because at my last property all my things got covered in dust from the Santa Maria winds! Such a pleasure meeting Sienna, Mona, and Joe!</Review>

I recently rented a storage unit at StorQuest Self Storage and  had a chance to meet the staff Sienna, Mona and Joe. Entire staff was very friendly and welcoming! The office as well as the units and property were super clean and very well maintained. After visiting many storage units this was by far the nicest and cleanest in town. The renting process was fast and smooth! If you’re looking for a safe place this is definitely the place to go! Thank you so much Sienna, Mona and Joe!< /Review>

<Text>The 5 stars are real. I have never rented a storage unit before, it was the smallest one they had, but I was respected as if I war renting the entire floor. It is a family run business and it shows in a good way. Family, friendly, complete information, and they are a lot of fun. They make it simple, easy, and enjoyable. They walked mt to my unit, and explained. it all to me. You really cannot ask for more from human beings than this, really, they did the best<//Text><name>Leyte Man< /name></record></dataset><record>

My experience here was amazing! When I got there I was greeted by the nice young lady up in the front I believe her name was Sienna I spoke with her on the phone before coming in and she was so friendly and helped me with all my questions about the unit I wanted to rent. I also met two others Joe and Mona who were both friendly as well and gave me a tour to find the perfect unit for my needs. 10/10 would recommend!</review>

Joe & Siena were very helpful and made the checking in, picking a unit and all  the paperwork go very smoothly. The facility is brand new very clean well maintained.
There was one feature I had down south that was very good in the same climate controlled type storage. There was outdoor access to a bathroom  after the office staff leaves,
Never hurts .  to make things simple for us Boomers✌😎

From the moment you walk in to the very clean lobby, you are greeted by the Managers, a husband & wife team who are very professional.

There are drive up ramps so you don't have to use stairs or an elevator.  4.  There was a large cart available to use to load all my stuff out of the car into the storage unit. 5.  The entire property is VERY CLEAN.  6.  Appears to have that friendly welcome where the Managers know the customers.< /Text><user>115207918966162130686< /user></record>

<Review>I am so pleased with our experience at StorQuest.  The new StorQuest facility is well designed, has many spaces, and is very reasonably priced.  The staff there are so nice and very knowledgeable. We have been renting a space at another facility in Santa Maria that has aggressively increased the monthly rent regularly. The trouble of moving to a new facility is well worth it in this case.  Thank you.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Started using the service and visited the place few days ago. Great place for several reasons.
1) the place is new and up-to-date. Only have opened for a bit over a month. One of the cleaner facility. They have nice office up at the front gate. Front gate are digital controlled for convenient access.
2) price. I believe the place gives discounts for its grand opening. A great time to start or switch to their service.
3) friendliness. The staff are friendly and professional. Office area is nice and clean. Necessary social distancing practices are in place to protect customers.<//review>

Had a great experience. Joe was extremely helpful, friendly, professional and more than accommodating. The units are brand new and very clean. There are dollies to help you easily move in at no charge. Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend to anyone.< /Review>

Renting the unit online was a hassle and though I paid on the 2nd.the company lock wasnt off therefore unit was not accessible till after the 5th. Then when I was given a unit it was all of the way in the back corner no light in unit and no electrical outlet to plug lamp in. I am not happy with the staff. Some woman drunk asking me who I was in pajamas and got snooty when I said why did she want to know. I emptied the unit the next day and dont intend on returning. In fact the walk from the door and unit and car is equal to one block and I dont want to go to such measures to put my things onto a tiny cart and into the unit. It would take me all day with a small truck load of things. I won't recommend this place nor will I return business.< /text>

Lorenzo here!

Very great customer service. Newest and cleanest Store place I've been. I just  hope there is a better way of reaching this place by phone locally  when you are a current customer. Only way to talk to customer service is by calling their call center in Florida through as a new customer.</text>

This is the fastest one I have ever been too. The food was fresh and really good. They have operations down to a gem. Other restaurants and chains can learn from this one. Staff is super polite and they care.</text>

Fast and friendly service. No dining currently with Covid restrictions. However the outside patio is nice. While we were eating I noticed an employee frequently wiping down the tables.<//review>

<review>Awesome food, quality was excellent. Their honey mustard was absolutely delicious for dipping sauce 4 the chicken strips and their chicken noodle soup was delicious.. What was an even more present surprise was their amazing customer service. Truthfully long Beach Lacks good customer service in pretty much every location of any kind of establishment so experiencing such stellar customer service is refreshing. Is also tells me that the other locations of food places or even drug stores, or any stores 4 that matter could also provide excellent customer service if they desired to but I'm seeing that they just don't enforce such a quality out of their employees& they accept poor performance which is a shame. Thank you Chick Fil A 4 showing LB how "Good customer service" is suppose to be like. Setting the bar, frankly where it should be... AWESOME EXPERIENCE AWESOME FOOD.. THANKS AGAIN...‼️🤗👍👌👏🤗🤙‼️‼️</review>< Pics>

I’m usually so very nice and understanding about busy places because I work in a very very busy restaurant but this was terrible. I told the drive through people I was getting an order online but also was going to place an order. Those two people in drive through told me they saw my order on their screen and I could get it at the window. The girl at the window then said “I don’t see your order you have to park and wait” okay if she didn’t see my order why would she still have me wait? I ended up waiting for 30 min I had pressed I’m here already and was still waiting for a confirmation for when my order was ready. Never got it. It had been an hour waiting in my car so I went inside and the cashier said he didn’t see my order. He asked for help from another lady she didn’t see it and walked away. He then asked his co-workers if they had seen the order all said no. Two out of all the people he asked were two people who had helped me and said “ill check” for my order. He then found it, printed the receipt , AND LAUGHED! he said it was made at 3:48 and the time was now 4:50! A whole hour for a sandwich, fries, and a drink. This was just outrageous.</text>

I took of one star for the over pricing but there are yummy items and also cheaper things on the menu as well. My favorite thing is the 5lb bags of ice. That will never cease to assure my return no matter what! And since I'm there, may as well grab something yummy, like a chicken sandwich and great Mac n cheese.<//review>

<Review>Wowie Wow WOW! This Chick-fil-a is quick and clean and delicious! That's everyone I could ever ask for in my manna provider. Definitely check this place out for your physical nourishment needs and check out your local Church of Jesus Christ for your spiritual nourishment needs ;)<//Review>< Pictures>

Apparently as the day comes to an end, the employees become more rude and don’t care, came here to pick up a Doordash order, and when I get there they tell me that someone already picked up the order. I call support and was told that no other driver was assigned to this order, long story short, these people LET THIS PERSONS ORDER GET STOLEN, they were supposed to remake the order, so waited for 40 minutes, for NOTHING, they NEVER MADE IT, so not only did you guys just let this order get stolen you don’t even care enough to correct YOUR mistake. A mistake that could’ve been easily avoided if you checked the persons order info, you must hate your job so much, why do they even work there?</text>

<Review>The drive through line is always long.  Plus, to get into line is not the easiest with the strange combination of parking lots and entrance near a street.  Still one of the best quick food chicken sandwiches!</Review>< pics>

<review>Incompetent staff

I pull up to the drive through and get a trainee so I am prepared to be patient. I ordered mac n cheese, tortilka soup and ceasar salad. I had to correct him three times on the salad as kept repeating ranch. 3 cars go by me on the other lane and I move a car length for another person to confirm my name and order. I tell him my order and find out tortilla soup not available so I cancel it and confirm the salad is ranch...yes it is I am told.

I pull up to the window and two employees are there to assist. They ask if I am Ralph...I say yes, mac n cheese and CEASAR  salad. They say yes. Again I say Ceasar salad and they say yes.  I get home 10 minutes later to find out I got a ranch salad....unbelievable<//review>< pictures>

<username>Agustin Delgado</username><text>This location is the worst I only come here cuz of the convenience of it being close to home. Every time I come here my order is always wrong. The people at the drive thru are the absolute worst. They didn’t ask for my name my order was wrong it wasn’t just wrong but when I go to to pay for some reason there was specific items added to my order like (sausage) which I never said. Good customer service but I think they mess up the orders way too many times.< /text></record>

< review>
I’ve lived in this neighborhood “Long Beach traffic circle” many years before Chic fil A came here. I enjoyed their service since they arrived until recently. The racial dynamics have changed recently whereas we have more African American and Hispanic residents and since this happened the food has become very salty. Not just on one or two occasions but to the point that I and some neighbors quit patronizing them. After months, today I gave them another chance not wanting to drive out of the neighborhood and neither my grandson or I could even swallow it because of so much salt. This is a health hazard and the timing can’t be worse. 2 stars for the great customer service.< /review>

<Review>I haven’t been eating inside this restaurant for quite awhile due to COVID-19 restrictions. However, I do buy food using the drive through window.  Chick-fil+A is very popular and there is usually a line. However, the restaurant runs this operation very efficiently. There are 2 lines with workers taking orders and then 2 more workers that would take care of your payment.  Then the 2 lines would merge into 1 just prior to the drive up window to pick up the order.  The operation runs like clockwork and it is quite fast. Chick-fil-A sandwiches and nuggets are very good.  There is a In-N-Out and a Carl’s Jr. close by. I could pick up burgers and chicken sandwich easily. When I feel a burger is too much for me, chicken sandwich is always a good alternative. I never buys chicken sandwich or nuggets from a burger joint. The location for this Chick-fil-A is very convenient. The employees are friendly and helpful.  Definitely, a good place to grab a chicken sandwich.</Review><user_id>104156178455983692122<//user_id></record>

Amazing service. Right from the start the lady that took my order was really nice. The gal who brought my meal to my table was really nice too. Made sure I had everything I needed. Although the line was out the door it moved along very quickly and my order came out extremely fast and HOT! Which I love! Thank you for the awesome dine in experience! I usually order to go, this was my first time eating there and I kinda want to do it again.< /text>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>Food is delicious. Needs to have more visible curbside pick up signs. With that being said, I came at night between 830 to 9pm and couldn't see the sign so I parked in front of door and inform this place that I was here. An older Hispanic rudely came out with my food complaining that I parked in the wrong area I apologize to him and he just walked away. I come to this place a lot and this is the first time i was approached by an employee rudely.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>This is the worst Chick-fil-A in America. The food always tastes reheated. Like this biscuits for example, are always chewy and tough. The breading on the chicken is always soggy. Portions are sad. Been to this location 3 times and never will again.< /text>< Name>

cold cold fries (once home to eat) if they know you can not eat your meal right away WHY is it too trouble to wrap fries w same foil wrapping they use for the sandwiches..also the spicy chicken sandwich way too crusty..too much bread.  It was a very disappointing trip to this place today!<//Review>

Food is great! Until they told me to have the drive thru young lady attendant with pancake make up told me to have a "blessit day" after I completed my order. These "christians" insisting and persisting on pushing it on others. I would've given a 5➕ with a simple "have a nice day."< /Review>

<resp>None<//resp><Time>1603390066909</Time><Rating>1</Rating><review>This is literally one of the worst fast food locations that I’ve had the misfortune of visiting. Planning on contacting the Owner / Operatior, because a simple review isn’t enough.

The line can be empty, at 9am, and they can still find a way to waste your time and mess up your order. I spoke with a manager on my way out, and they gave me a gift card for their horrendous performance, but i gave them away, because even free food from here isn’t worth it.

This location single-handedly made me no longer like Chik-fil-a, which as a company is actually decent.</review>< name>

Kristie, we received your notice inside of our bag that you don't plan to complete well done orders as of February 1st 2020. You referenced industry standards, however (well-done) is not over cooking. At other locations a notice of this sort hasn't been provided.

Distributing information of this magnitude also makes us wonder if your worry is about revenue and not about the customers who keep you in business. With so many locations like this popping up it's not really an inconvenience, rather than you sending customers to your competition, or to other franchise owners. There are times when the nuggets are not crispy they are soft (so to be safe we request you cook them longer). To be honest with you it is the main reason we are attracted to the food for the crispy taste. We appreciate the warning notice! If we are in the area again we promise to eat elsewhere (making mental notes). Many blessings.< /Review>

While the staff was really friendly as usual. You come to chik fil a because they are professionals. We get to the window and the young lady says to us while we make sure the food is all there. She says "don't worry everything is there". We get home and everything is not there. Never trusting you with a spicy chicken sandwich again.</text>

<review>Great Food but so much waste for small meal eating there :-(  Management think outside the box.  Eliminate ketchup plastic with eat in dispensers,  don't need that big sandwich box if you carry the box from kitchen to the table.  Also the guy that is cleaning the tables all the time,  why does he can't use a wiper that he can use multiple times? Sad that big companies care so less about creating so much waste :(< /review>< name>

Long drive thru line as usual, young lady taking the order was sort of rude, didn't sound genuine when thanking me. Chicken strips were average but the chick-fil-a sauce made them taste better, the waffle fries taste better than the chicken actually. I still don't understand the hype.< /text>

I had Chick-fil-a for the first time. I wanted to test out what people were raving about. Hands down, they have the best chicken sandwiches. I’m so excited for Chick fil a to open in Toronto, you can believe I will be there the day it opens!</text>

Drive through is great.  Location is very busy and crowded..  a good thing, but feels a bit less clean than other locations because of the traffic.   Foods great like all chick-fil-a and staff is exceptional as well.  Best people work for this co.</text>

<text>I asked for a large arnold palmer with a few pumps/shots of the mango syrup. They refused to do it at the drive-thru on their iPad. I then asked at the window, also refused and avoided answering the question of why they won't do it.

I do not see a rule about it. It's like going to McDonald's and asking them to put cream in an iced tea. They will put a "special request" tag on the drink and do it for you. I don't know why I had this experience. Honestly want a refund but I don't want to haggle anymore. I left unsatisfied, have never had a problem with them and I've been coming here for over a year. Stacked up thousands of points. Not sure if I want to go back to this location.< /text>< UserId.>

For COVID-19 the dining area is closed and you can't sit inside or outside. You have to go through the drive through or walk up to the back door and put your order through there. Still it's open and it's Chick-fil-A. As always don't bother on Sundays.<//Text>

Y’all service was trash today .... y’all rushed me through the line  because y’all had “customers” I’m a customer too and if I need a second to pay y’all should wait ... i waiting in line just like everyone else ...  to have two of your employees rushing me and telling me to go inside is ridiculous because y’all want to move the line<//review>

I love Chick-fil-A. The food and service is amazing. I love the double line feature and how there are so many team members ready to help. Chick runs a clean and tight ship. I stop by here frequently when I'm in the mood for a good chicken salad or sandwich. This is a great spot and one of my recommendations for anyone that hasn't given them a try.<//Text>

This is a newer chick-fil-a location near the traffic circle.  Great chicken sandwich.  The only challenge is on Sundays when you crave Chick-fil-a and they are closed.<//review>

For how friggin busy they are, the food is consistently correct. It's a long wait whether you go pick up yourself or order delivery, but that's to be expected with current covid precautions.< /Review>

<Text>Came here for drive thru, which was packed!!! The cashiers outside looked very disorganized mostly talking amongst each other. When I finally got my food I was excited to go home and enjoy. Well the nuggets we got were good and so were the chicken tenders, my sandwich arrived smushed and looking very sad.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSBSV3Mxpz5W4EWEBpKXbxghLln_x3myXIoylS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<Review>Stopped here for breakfast on my way to work, friendly staff, order was made quickly and tasted delish. I like the home style taste of the food. The coffee was hot, but not too hot that you could burn your tongue. They offer two flavors (hazelnut & french vanilla) of International Delight coffee creamers, which is a nice touch, since I love coffee creamers. The staff was friendly and brought my to go order to me as I was seated waiting. Parking is easy here, right off PCH, plenty of spaces in a newer shopping center. I will definitely come back to the location.</Review><Response>None< /Response><Time>1573605168008<//Time>< user>

<Review>These people have a great system down. Quick service and pleasant employees. The food was very hot and my kid loves the chicken tenders and waffle fries so this is nice to have as an option while we're out. The chic-fil-a sauce is delicious but its really just sugar.</Review><gmapID>0x80dd31941bd88101:0x24ef065e89051282</gmapID>< username>

So for a $9.00 plus tax meal...i ordered an 8 piece grilled nuggets... i guess a small piece of a nugget, counts as 1? I expect a lot for the prices.<//Review>

The food and service always great. Unfortunately tonight we went through Drive Thru and got the wrong order. We called them when we got home and realized the mistake and they gave us a online coupon for our missed meal. Very nice place.</Text>

My favorite fast food place to go to. Always great service with great quality food. Whether you’re dining in or taking out, you get your food very quickly and always hits the spot. Wish I would stop craving it every Sunday!</Text>

<review>Clean location and usually great service. Play area is also kept clean which is a definite plus. Drive thru can get backed up (usually around 130pm) but that's normal for the good fast food in this area.< /review><username>Alaina Ash< /username>< Rating>

Although I love Chick Fil A and will probably continue going to this one (because it is closer than all others), this one ALWAYS forgets something. Just recently they forgot my cookie and one of my French fries for a combo. Yes I called back and they gave me a credit for next time, but the reason I ordered it was because I wanted it this time. This definitely wasn't the first time it has happened at this location. The food is still amazing and their friendliness is great. I just wished they would get orders correct the first time more often.< /Text>

<Review>It’s a new and very nice chic fil a, there are two lanes with at least 5 people taking orders. It is usually crowded but the lines move quick, and you can also order ahead of time through the app. They always are generous with the sauce, I wish more chic fil A’s were like that. They also rarely mess up my order and they have a bike rack right next to where the workers take orders for the drive through, so I’m not worried locking up my bike there<//Review>< Pics>

It is usually crowded but the lines move quick, and you can also order ahead of time through the app. They always are generous with the sauce, I wish more chic fil A’s were like that. They also rarely mess up my order and they have a bike rack right next to where the workers take orders for the drive through, so I’m not worried locking up my bike there< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>Chick-fil-A is one of my favorite places to eat. The menu and food is rather gourmet for fast food. they definitely keep the area clean and one thing I like about this place is that the free meals that they often give for free Chick-fil-A day or coupons in the mail or pretty generous. Too bad they're closed on Sundays though.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< user_id>

Nice new restaurant! I ordered the chicken minis that they now serve all day and the bread was soggy so I sent them back and ordered the 12 piece nuggets and they were delicious! I also ordered the waffle fries and they weren't fresh. I was surprised.< /Text>

<review>You can not go wrong with Chick-fil-a this place is really nice and super clean. Today ( November 9, 2019 ) me and my coworker had the spicy chicken sandwich with Chick-fil-a Nuggets and a soft drink. And as we sat down at our table, our food was there within minutes. Now I call this great customer service here.

I did not half to get up and get a refil on my drink, this guy was would you like a refil? AMAZING services at this location. And when we where done with our lunch, got ice cream to go....that is right....

A great location, near the airport, good customer service. There is a children's play area located here. The service was decent, and to be expected from this restaurant. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Plenty of parking and outdoor seating too! Just don't go on Sunday, they'll be closed</Review>

In my humble opinion, Chick-fil-A has the best fried chicken recipe of all take out restaurants. Possibly because I have a profound sweet tooth and a penchant for Christian businesses that close on Sundays, their secret ingredient in the batter keeps me coming back for more. 😉 The market salad with a substitution of nuggets for grilled filet with balsamic vinaigrette for the dressing is my favorite "healthy"choice on the menu. The bleu cheese crumbles mixed with the strawberries are the difference maker for me on this entree. My other favorite item on the menu that always gives the cashier/clerk a smirk or a chuckle is the kid's meal 6 piece nugget meal with a diet coke and 1 ketchup packet and 1 chick fil a sauce. I always tell them to keep the kid's toy that is usually included in such "meals" and to substitute for an ice cream cone. Hands down chick fil A has the best soft serve vanilla ice cream in the world. It is so good, that even when it was zero degrees outside in the greater Chicagoland area, when my sweet tooth would hit, off to the drive through I would go for that little treat. Don't judge. Seriously, it's that delicious, plus it's family friendly and they take customer service very seriously with their "my pleasure" and asking for your name instead of giving you a number at the counter.<//review>

The absolute WORST.

Clearly thier focus is on the speed of getting an order out of thier queue.  They do NOT check orders for correctness.
EVERY single time I have come, because my kid loves thier chicken... our order is WRONG... it will be something as simple as FRIES WELL DONE...which would mean crispy... not soggy. And they must spend an extra 30 seconds if that.. NEVER have we has well done fries.
They give us drinks in the drive thru without straws.  . . Um. Ya ever try to drive a car and drink a soda with no lid?! Thanks for the stains on my shirt.
I ask for a spicy chicken and get one covered in cheese...
I finally told the manager... I'm DONE with this BS. DONE w ChikFilA. Especially when there is Canes and Popeyes.  . . Focus should be on customer service and CORRECT orders.< /Text>

They have 2 driveways and block the parking lot with cones so you are forced into the drive thru. Unbelievable foresight on the part of the management. I was trapped in the drive thru because of this........nonsense not common sense< /Text>

Fast food is what it is. But if you want to be served by someone with a smile Chick-fil-A seems to be the place to go. You will not hear an employee say no problem which is just a tired old meaningless cliche to say. The answer is always my pleasure. they seem to have a screening process where people with bad attitudes simply don't make the cut and don't get hired. That alone is reason to go there over other typical chains.<//Review>

I have avoided Chik-fil-a since they became a thing simply for political reasons. I had an opportunity to try them finally and am so glad that I did. The food is delicious and the people are so friendly and really seem to love what they do. I would definitely try this one again.< /text>

Awesome customer service hands down! The food was amazing and I feel like its honestly one of two fast food joints in the US that lives up to its hype!

Shout out to Adrian for accomodating us and making sure everything was good and of course the rest of the team who were great aswell!

Peace guys!< /review>

< Review>
This is one of the nicest Chick-fil-A's I've been to. It has a children's play area as well! The staff here are friendly and inviting. If you're looking for something you can get fast but still have some good healthy choices this is the place for you.</Review>

Drive-through is really fast, I went during lunch rush, They had 3 people working outside, 2 to take the orders, 2 lanes, 1 to organize the orders in sequence,   plus it was yummy and I like it spicy with guacamole< /review>

<Text>Something seems out of sync. It seem they just push you through.. Very nice but do not seen really focused  on you. The smiles are there the words are there. But things are  wrong.  Tonight ice cream soupy and a box hole in the middle is ice cream. Crust on chicken greasy.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I would give it five stars but sometimes it's just so full you can't park. During lunch the drive through line can snake all the way into the street.<//text>

The chicken strips are really good. However it's slightly more expensive than most fast food and I cant figure out why the fries are always cold.🤔< /Review>

<Text>Ordered a Spicy Deluxe chicken sandwich meal. Was given a plain chicken sandwich. Cashier made me pay for a new sandwich and throw out the incorrect sandwich. Not very smart service strategy. Cashier looked new and didn't repeat the order at the time of payment. Probably misheard me.< /Text>< pictures>

The food is always spot on and I'm in love with their service. Keep it up guys and gals!

With the advent of the app, it makes it waaaaay easier to order with the kids in the car when you don't want to go through the drive-through during busy meal times. And believe me, it gets bu-sy!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

I knew Jesus would return, but I didn't think he would work at chik fil-a and be named DILLON.  Tonight our order was taken by not just a nice guy....but THE nice guy.  DILLON is a shining example of what service should be!  He is the Schindlers List to the holocaust of poor restaurant experiences.  A new tux in a world of brown shoes.  Tonight I learned the name of my unborn son...his name shall be DILLON....so that maybe one day he too can spread joy throughout the world.  If DILLON started a cult...his koolaid would be spiked with kindness!  I now know what the angels will say when they welcome me home...."Hi, may name is DILLON...how may I serve you today."

Then when we got home after regaling each other with our own personal DILLON experience....I found an extra nugget in my 12 piece meal.  I like to think this was a little special gift from DILLON.< /review>

This is the best Chick-fil-A that I've been to but I love all the Chick-fil-A's even the ones that are ports Like Love Field but Long Beach has two great ones now and that is awesome can't wait to see more of them pop up all around Southern California San Gabriel Valley. Brovo Chick-fil-A you're awesome!<//Text>

Best place to have chicken sandwiches and hangout with friends. I was a little sceptical about their burger but when I tried it it blew my mind. Chick-fil-A for chicken in-n-out for beef.</Text>

I was sooo confused about all the hype until I went to ANY other location really. This location is sooo disappointing I will never go here! How there suppose to be vs how they are is rediculous. I keep meaning to calll corporate but I work two jobs and I'm too busy so while I have the time now I'm saying I'm very disappointed in this location there poor service occasional cold nuggets but mainly the SERVICE! There suppose to be number one but here at the PCH location they are no good, the employees don't deserve to work for that company they should move out the way for people who actually want the job and do it right. I'm a very hard worker so I don't appreciate the lack of work ethic this location shows. They put a bad name to the company I've been there 5 times trying!

I've had a lot of chicken sandwiches and the Chick-fil-a's Chicken sandwich is the better fast food option iver the rest. The chicken is fried goodness topped with lettuce, tomato, and you have the option for some pretty amazing sauces. I've yet to find a fast food restaurant with a better chicken sandwich or better service as everyone here is super friendly almost scary friendly.  Super happy this location came to Long Beach.<//Text>

< review>
Today was my first visit to a new place. I was informed by a friendly member of the excellent staff that they have been open since October 2017. This is a great new place. The dining room is huge and has large windows that let in plenty of light and there is even a children's playroom in a separate access area at the far end of the dining area. Perfect for families with children. The restrooms are state of the art and very spacious. There is a red umbrella dining area outside the front end of the building. The Traffic Circle is right across the road from the front of the building and the outside dining area. An excellent location.
I had the Chick Fil-A deluxe with the waffle fries and generous amounts of ice-cold cherry coke and I was, from the first bite, extremely impressed with the uniqueness and quality of the taste and the quality of the ingredients used. I have, over the years, had the chicken from all the other ones, McDonalds, Wendy's, Carls Jr ect..., and I can say that without a doubt that this is the best chicken that I have EVER tasted. Something about how it is prepared, I'm not going to tell you the secret, seals in the flavor and boosts it to the front end of the flavor spectrum. None of the others can hold a candle to this. I will say it again, This is THE BEST chicken I have EVER tasted.
The wonderful staff ply you with refills so you don't have to get it yourself most of the time. None of the others do this and that is another distinction that puts them a cut above the rest right off the bat.
I will most assuredly return again to continue my exploration of the gastronomical delights contained in their substantial menu. If you are reading this, I challenge you to go with THE BEST and to forget all the rest. Why do you want McDonalds when you can have THIS!!!.

I mean the food is typical Chickfila but there's one girl in particular with a  bad Popeyes attitude. More realistic than those  "My pleasure" bots at every other location. I respect how she's rolled her eyes at other employees or me 2 out of the 3 times I've been at this  CFA. I don't like folks with bad attitudes but I dislike fake happy attitudes more.</Review>

The service was very slow.  Compared to the other chic-fil-a in the area at the other stores have people that stay outside to expedite to get customers in the drive thru in and out. Had to waite 45 mins to get meal. FAR TO LONG.< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I would rather starve than go here again!
I've been to at least a dozen CfL and this is BY FAR the worst! The 1st time: Went just after they opened. Got cheese in my sandwich when I clearly said that I'm lactose intolerant! And my daughter got pickles in hers, which she hates!
Went to the counter to tell a manager but saw a giant ROACH fall from the ceiling to the floor. I told a staff person and they just picked it up and walked away - no urgency. It must've not been the first time...
Finally told a mgr who offered my fresh sandwiches and 2 gift cards.
I let it go since they were brand new..

2nd time: Used my gift cards. Went thru drive-thru. YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT... cheese and pickles!!
So then I refused to ever go here again.

3rd (and last time): I returned because we were starving on our way home. Big Mistake! Got a different order at drive-thru. They asked me if I wanted sauces (as usual) and I said 8 pls (as usual). Drove to the window and someone gave me a bag. How many sauces are in here? I asked. I think 4, she said. Well I need 4 more. Sorry, we only give 2 per entree. EXCUSE ME?? I have never heard that in my entire life! Other chick fil A's have their sauces out at a table. Nobody counts or monitors anyone. WTH! Oh, and the chicken was HARD and the fries were STALE!

Chick fil A at the Towne Center is 10000x better! I'd rather drive out of my way than deal with their unprofessional selves.

Truly WORST chick fil A ever. I'm SO done.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dd31941bd88101:0x24ef065e89051282</gmapID></record>

Came here after getting a tooth extracted. Chick fil a isn't ideal after that, but it sure was awesome. Nothing beats a chicken sandwich after a long day.< /Text>
