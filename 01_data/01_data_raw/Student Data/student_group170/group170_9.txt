<review>Love this place! Been around 30+ years! They're professional, detailed, good price, and use this special app from computer to text to approve or decline work orders so there is no "I didn't approve that but you did it anyway" type of shadiness. Plus it gives you real time quotes so you can stay within your budget! Definitely going back for my other cars</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

100% Recommend This Place For Your Auto Repair They Fixed My Car With Perfection. Never Rush Your Mechanic If You Want Your Vehicle Fixed Properly.

Rod and the other guy’s at Phil’s really deserve your business! My whole family brings all our cars there. Each time it’s a professional, quick experience.

I brought in a 98’ Frontier that was just supposed to need a minor fix up to clear an engine light to pass smog. The project ended up being an almost 2 month Nightmare! Even Phil was called in to help fix it.

Most places would’ve handed me back the keys and say ‘they did what they could...’ BUT, the guys at Phil’s were great throughout the whole thing!! Fixing each problem as it came up and communicating as the process evolved. Also, they kept the cost as long as possible.<//review>

<review>As far as Mechanic Work, all they did was change and Alternator and a Battery, nothing any mechanic wont be able to do. Customer Service isn't bad, but Charged over $800. Mechanic work is fine, Price not so much, Called my local Jeep dealer, quoted me $754.00 for the exact same job and non aftermarket parts. I got aftermarket parts, and it cost me more. Just Check with dealer before you agree to a job.<//review>< Gmap_id>

This was my second experience here...just as good as the first!  I feel that they are aware of and care about your time as well as your vehicle.  No heavy sales or pressure...just tells you what's wrong (if anything) and you go from there.  Prices are competitive.  Clean waiting room with beverages and snacks; and a clean bathroom!< /Text>

My MB engine was not starting or turning over when I put the key in. I called Phil’s and they let me know when to bring it in and when they could start looking at it, based on their work schedule. I appreciated that. They kept in contact with me during the process advising of their findings and progress. I appreciated that. When I finally went to pick up my vehicle they were very honest and more than fair in the charges. I can’t be more pleased with the service I receive here, the honesty and relationship I am building with the owner. Thank you Phil’s and Bryan. I also drive 45 mins (from the high desert) to bring my vehicle to Phil’s as I trust them.</Text>

<text>I have used Phil's for many years. They have always been very accommodating to me.  Very professional and honest.  Over the years there was only one time that I had to take something back. It was a long time ago, so I don't remember exactly what it was (want say brakes... master cylinder) but there was no hassle, we worked together narrowed it down and they found the solution at no extra cost to me except the part.  I still use them all the time.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<time>1525114496054<//time><Text>Phil’s Auto Clinic did a great job diagnosing my trucks issues and repairing it quickly.

They also saved me real money by making a small repair now and then asking me to drive the truck for a few weeks to see if the rough idle returns. They could have sold me on a larger repair, but instead made the choice to see if this fix works before we spend a lot more money. Honest, moral people with good intentions.

Thanks Phil’s Auto Clinic and thanks Brian for a great experience.

Phil’s is our go-to repair shop for our Ford Expedition, Ford F250 Diesel Truck and Audi A8 Quatro.  As our vehicles age they require more maintenance and diagnosis and we need the most economical and best job our money can give us.  Phil’s does that for us and we are really happy with them.<//Review>

I have been in the field of many trades that demand a level of professionalism. My fields are automotive ASE certs, Ca.Smog Advanced Auto Diagnostics licensed and certified, Aircraft welding LA certs to name a few. I was able to be on the inside looking out in regards to customer satisfaction and have seen the inconsistent treatment throughout the fields and I must say that Phil's Auto Clinic is a true benchmark other establishments should strive towards. They are thorough,how so you might ask,well the moment that I asked for a future appointment for a brake fluid flush and to determine the cost I was informed by Bryan that they already tested the fluids for contaminants , at no charge I might add and the service was not needed at this time! . They truly are a shop that does look out for your safety and well being,as in days past when it was more personal .<//text>

Absolutely loved my experience with Phil's Auto Clinic. They take care of you as if you're family! The wait is a big longer for an oil change but it's well worth it compared to drive thru oil change shops. They let you know in advance if they feel a problem might arise and they give you affordable choices and options that can fix the problem if something does happen. They don't try to sell you everything, they just get the job done. They are absolutely honest and have the best price in town for an oil change. I highly recommend Phil's Auto Clinic. They didn't let me down and I'll be sure to return for any future work.< /Text>

If you want to get what you pay for, that being a job done once and done right, Phil's is my Top Choice. I have owned three hybrid vehicles in the past 9 years all of which Phil's have serviced beyond my satisfaction. I have never taken more pleasure in referring my friends and family to a business then I have referring them to Phil's. I trust him like a brother! Thanks Phil, Bryan and the rest of the team. Job well done! See you soon. Wayne Dion<//Review>

I drive a hybrid and live 70 miles away.  I prefer Phil's Auto Clinic to the  dealership for many reasons, it is more personal, great mechanics, and friendly service.  Phil's has always been honest and clear regarding what is going on with my auto (now over 200,000 miles) and I've never felt like they were trying to add on service like the dealership.   Bryan has always been courteous and I try to support local businesses even though this one is an hour away!</review>

I have been coming to Phils Auto since 2000.  My first year was trying out different auto repair businesses but, I stuck with Phils Auto. 1. They stand behind their work.  2. Their honesty.  3.  Their professionalism. 4. Being a women I have had years of being taken for a stupid women when going to get my car fixed.  Phils auto treats women with the respect they deserve.</Text>

The service at phil`s Auto is excellent. They have serviced all my vehicles for many years. They stand behind their work and go above and beyond to make the customer happy. I highly recommend Phil`s Auto Clinic.< /review>

We have two autos that we do not even consider taking them anywhere else for maintenance and repair work.  Phil's has solved problems that the dealers could not.  Phil's auto clinic has been able to identify and fix  problems that were very specialized issues with one of our autos and we were grateful for the expert service that we received.< /Text>< response>

<Review>For now I'll just say I'm glad we got the car back.  Have yet to drive it because it needs a smog and registration which the owner Bryan said we will have to come back Monday to do something or it will automatically fail a smog test.  I just gotta wonder if that's the case why isn't that always just done to save someone this future potential headache?  Had I not mentioned it, we could have had a failed test at some point and no idea why.

So we chose this place bc it had great reviews and unfortunately this shop seems to be experiencing quite a bit of disorganization and difficulty getting on top of what seems to be a greater workload than they can handle at the moment.  We brought the car in need of a new engine and agreed upon price ($3000), for a used engine with under 50k miles and a completion date which came and went with no call from them.

My husband initiated contact to be told the engine had come in that day( was a Friday) and that Monday it would be put in.  They expected to have it ready the next Friday.  (As a side note this was to be a 17th birthday present for our son on August 10th) which clearly didn't happen. So that next Friday came and went and I initiated contact and got Rod who said, "we finally got the right engine in and so hopefully should be done by next. Thursday or Friday.

This is when I expressed that last we heard, we were told it would be today -- that was the info we got last week and have heard no change from them.  So Rod goes into a laundry list of apologies and excuses:  short staffed, running behind etc.  I simply said that we know things happen but couldn't understand why there had been no communication whatsoever.  He simply apologized again so that ended that convo.

Decided the follow up with Bryan following Monday and he was very nice and apoligized and said my concerns were valid so he was going to have someone work overtime to have it done Monday.   Well starting Monday at least comnunication improved but still the car wasn't done until late Thursday and he drove it from his shop in town to me this morning.

I do appreciate that Bryan was willing to drop it off at my house and he ran it through the car wash he said.  We are to bring it back on a certain date for an oil change and Monday as I said for some diagnostic to prevent a failed smog.   Other than our auto club discount there was no offer of any free services or discount for the inconvenience or anything whatsoever.

So the jury is out.. Fingers crossed

Addendum: 8/30/19
Bryan I'm sorry your ego is bruised by my review but your response is a very good example of your inability to communicate.
1.  I never used any vulgar language to Rod or anyone else.  What I did was request that communication come to me as opposed to phoning the husband in another state on business.
2.  You stood in my driveway and instructed me to bring in the car before smogging so something could be done yet when we did come in, you did nothing except talk in circles and make more excuses.</Review>< Pics>

<response>{'time': 1567103681544, 'text': 'Traci,\nWe know that we have worked hard to rectify this situation with you the past couple of days and unfortunately all we have left is this review response. We understand how frustrated you are about the situation, but we would also like to touch on a couple of items you mentioned in your review to hopefully let people know that there is always two sides to one story. In the initial conversations, smog was never brought up…it was only until I had gave you the keys in your personal driveway where smog was mentioned. I let you know that there were self-tests that needed to be completed after a car has its battery disconnected, otherwise it will automatically fail smog. We can see how frustrated you’ve been about the communication, and although we have spoken in person about your review, you failed to mention the part where you called our shop using vulgar language while yelling at our service advisor, Rod about not calling you when we couldn’t even get a personal phone number from you. On top of that, you also said how we were calling your husband too much, which goes against what you’ve stated in your review. We want to let you know that we do take your feedback and concerns seriously and we put our customers always as a priority. My employees, including myself, have been very patient and understanding with you and we hope that after this entire situation you may start to understand our side of the story. Thank you Traci, and if you have any more you would like to discuss with us, please give a call.'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I have never actually had MY car repaired by Phil's auto clinic.  I have, however, sent many, many vehicles to this establishment to have repairs made and every time the staff has been exceptional, the repairs are done at the highest standards and never can I say a person I sent over there was taken advantage of.
Personally, I have been working as an automotive technician for almost 20 years.  I have worked for Toyota for 11 years, worked in independent shops for four years and now work for a local municipality and school district.   Phil was one of my teachers when I was first out of high school going to college.  Phil has held many classes at his facility to teach professional technicians what/how a system works.  He is the top of the technician class and his staff is expected to be in the same class.  I cannot say enough good things about this man and his establishment.  His reputation with other technicians speaks for itself.  He is the guy we send vehicles to that no one else can fix.  He is who we send our mom to when we want her vehicle fixed correctly, in a timely manner and without the worry of her being taken care of.

I wrote this review today because I was outright shocked at some of the reviews I read on Google about his establishment.   The only thing I can assume about the negative reviews would be that the customers had unrealistic expectations or are just plain ignorant.  Sure, Phil's is not the cheapest place out there, but you will not find a better overall establishment, not even at the dealership.  And that is coming from a guy who worked at the dealer for 11 years....  Phil and his staff are highly knowledgeable, professional, courteous, understanding, and HONEST.  What more could you ask for?<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

We took our Toyota Avalon in to Phil’s Auto for service. Bryan had made some suggestions at our last visit never feeling pressured to do any ASAP, so we have done a priority list. This service we needed just two new tires, no up selling to four, so we had two items from the suggested list done. We never feel pressure to complete all the list items. They are honest with what is needed no more no less. Bryan even gave me a ride home and picked me up when the job was completed. Now that’s customer service!😃< /text>

Phil's auto service was there to help. Brain in the office was extremely helpful, with daily calls, and his experience made feel that I was in the right place for repair of my Nissan Altima. I would recommend this place to repair any future endeavors in the future regarding my car, or any car I may own in the future. I really appreciated the knowledge of his mechanics. 4 stars out of 4 for my experience.<//review>

Recently, my 2001 Honda Insight (hybrid) went completely haywire and was not sure that I wanted to put the money into saving my little gas miser.  I finally decided to have it taken to Phil's Auto Clinic in Hemet (which was 60 miles from my location); what a blessing it was!

The service was incredible!  As soon as the car was delivered (by tow truck) they were right on it and had diagnosed and priced in a short time.  I was extremely pleased with the price of the installed, rebuilt (hybrid) battery and had additional repair items done.

When I picked up my car, I was pleased to see that the customer and shop areas were as professional and manicured as any dealer that I have been to.  Additionally, I spent quite a bit of time with Bryan and Phil, asking questions, to which they were happy to answer.

I would recommend Phil's Auto Clinic to anyone; especially if you are having any problems with your hybrid.  Take care and God bless!   :)<//review>

A great example of how to do business and explains why they have been in the community so long.<//text>< Pictures>

Finding an honest auto mechanic can be challenging. Please read my story. I have been a customer of Phil’s Auto Clonic for over 20 years.

I have a 2005 Honda Pilot. It has been a great car to own. It has 180,000 miles so I worry about car problems.

My wife and I were in Sacramento when I discovered I had to have some brake work. At a Sacramento National brand tire shop I was told I needed to replace my lower control arm bushing. The mechanic showed me that it was obviously worn and needed replacing. This bushing is made of heave duty rubber and I could see it looked worn. I told the mechanic I would get it fixed when I got home.

I took my Car to Phil’s Auto Clinic where I have been going for over 20 years fully expecting to replace the control arm bushing. The manager at Phil’s said “let’s see if the bushing is bad before we replace it. Sure it looks weathered on the outside but if it’s bad you will have abnormal tire wear and you should be feeling it in the steering.”  He put my car on the lift and checked for play in the joint. There was none. My tires have around 30,000 miles an them and they are wearing evenly with no abnormal wear. The manager said “We do not recommend replacing the bushing at this time because it is not worn out”.  I was very thankful.

6 months later I was at the local Honda dealer for a factory recall. While I was there they told me I needed to replace my lower control arm bushing. The service writer said “ You can see for yourself it look worn out”. I said I would check with my mechanic. I went back to Phil’s again and said the Honda dealer says I should replace that control arm bushing.  The manager said we could replace it but “We are not recommending replacement because it is functioning perfectly. It is not worn out”!

I realized then and there that Phil’s Auto Clinic is possibly the only auto repair shop that cares about honesty and integrity whether they make a profit or not!  I appreciate that!

I LOVE Phil's Auto!  After my previous car's engine took a dive (due to lack of proper maintenance) they were very honest and upfront with me and when it was evident that my car was irreparable they even took the price down a bit and were very courteous.  My previous car still had our belongings in it and I had no way of getting it out, so an employee even picked me up and gave me a ride to get our stuff.  With our new car, I won't take it anywhere else unless we move to a completely different area (like three hours away).<//text>

<Text>My husband and I have been going to Phil's for over 10 years.  They are excellent in both their service and knowledge.   We have taken all our adult children's cars there as well and have always had great service with excellent results. The people who don't like Phil's are stupid about cars.  They are used to shoddy service and incompetent mechanics.  If you want HONEST and COMPETENT service.....go to Phil's Auto Clinic.< /Text>< name>

I was unable to pass smog and after spending hundreds of dollars at my regular mechanic I finally contacted the Bureau of Automotive Repair and they referred me to Phil's Auto Clinic.Turns out the problem was the Mass Air Flow Sensor which I had JUST replaced at my regular mechanics but the part was defective! Dan at PAC was attentive, patient and explained what was going on with my car in a way that was easy for me to understand and as a result I learned a lot about how my car works with out even trying to.  : ) I left there with my smog cert. and a smile. I certainly recommend Phil's Auto Clinic.<//review>

< Review>
I have taken all three of my vehicles into phils for a few years now & i can say i'm am very happy with the way i am treated. I feel very confident with the staff & I feel that they are honest with me. They are always there for me when i call in with a question. I have been sending my family there as well & they are very happy with the service..
I especially am fond of the owner of phils, Bryan takes his time to answer my questions & gets me in for an appointment rite away.< /Review>

Incompetence is what comes to mind, $800.00 bill for a part that cost $60.00 I brought it in for stalling they fixed that with the $ $60.00 part the other problem was a transmission problem couldn't tell me the problem just get a new transmission so asked if a service would help? maybe or maybe not was the answer ! they did the service made no difference !! The most expensive and incompetent repair shop around. The car left there running worse than when we brought it in, didn't even make into town took it to Aamco they diagnosed the problem within 1/2 hr for FREE !!  Don't take your car to Phils unless you have a lot of $ to lose and have another car to drive !!</text>

Their service is consistently thorough and they are very friendly (especially Brian!). I like that Phil's keeps a clean shop and grounds. That tells me they have a lot of pride.

Being a routine customer, Phils has always jumped on our few emergencies and got our cars ready to go quickly. I drive 750 miles per week, so auto maintenance and repair are very important to me. I would highly recommend this shop for any auto work, (old, new, or electric) that one will need. The mechanics are well trained, as evidenced by the certificates and awards they post in the comfortable waiting room. Give Phils a try, you will not be disappointed.

Called and asked for a quote on how much to replace a harmonic balancer and serpitine belt on a 2005 Pontiac Geand AM. He refused to without knowing what i had been quoted from another Mechanic and then hung up on me. Being rude and trying to bully a customer is not how to earn my business.<//review>

<Review>My 2005 Honda Accord Hybrid has 200k miles on it.  Its hybrid battery has been out of commission for the last 40k miles (the check engine light and IMA lights have been engaged this entire time) but has operated fine.  Well, this year when renewing my registration I was told I needed a SMOG check for the first time.  Got the car SMOG'd only to find out a check engine light = automatic fail.  I went to the Honda dealership and asked if they could disengage the light or something, considering the code triggering the light (P1600) had NOTHING to do with emissions.  They said my options were A. Pay $3500 to get a replacement battery or B. trade the car in.

NICE SCAM YOU'VE GOT GOING THERE HONDA.  Especially rich because at the time of the purchase, the dealer said after the battery dies the car can be operated as a gas-powered car.  Using this BS loophole in California's SMOG check, Honda coerced me into replacing the battery (which costs about the same as the value of the car).

Anyway I found Phil's on Ebay after looking for a less expensive option.  The battery included new cells (Honda uses refurbished), was $1300 cheaper, and comes with a 2 year warranty.  I was not intending to replace the battery but being forced to, Phil's auto clinic was a good choice.  Took about 3 hours, and he was able to SMOG the car after installing the battery.

I would like to note that my mileage has not increased as much as I had anticipated.  On gas I got about ~19 in the city and ~34 on the freeway.  Now I get ~24/38.  Still, this is around the EPA MPGs.

Overall I'm satisfied, happy I wasn't forced to junk my car and also glad I didn't have to give the cons at Honda any money.  Will not be buying Honda again.  Would recommend Phil's Auto Clinic for a hybrid battery replacement.</Review>< Pics>

Santa Clara city library at the Central Park location has curbside pickup which I found very useful. I was impressed with the traffic management the crew had set up. I arrived on my bicycle and waited in the walk-up line. When it was my turn I showed them my card. I was offered a grab bag option like mystery or young adult. All in all it was a very smooth experience. I recommend watching the video they've posted on the library's website ahead of time just so you know what you're getting into.</text>

Wonderful studying and working environment: clean restroom and plenty of seats with sockets. I like that there’s a mini cafe on the first floor! During weekdays, it’s not too challenging to find parking.< /text>

<text>Really clean and comfortable place with a lot of natural light to study and read. Quiet study is my favorite area to work.
There are a lot of events for kids and I also heard in broadcast that they have some “dancing event” :)
Only thing I want to complain is that the Wifi is not stable sometimes.<//text>< Pics>

It took 40 minutes to pickup books today. They said they haven't been open for the last couple of days. They should have known to open more than 2 pickup spots for cars then.< /text>

<gmap_id>0x808fb57edaed9903:0x881294cf2f99f6fc<//gmap_id><Review>This is a great library with well curated new books and thematic recommendation sections, friendly staff, and thoughtful additions like coloring tables for children. The decor of the building itself is very inviting, and spacious with lots of separate spaces to sit and work across the two floors. There is a small used books section which sells paperbacks at 75 cents and a passable Cafe at the back. A good place to spend some time working or reading.<//Review></record>

I enjoyed coming here but due to the covid virus, I missed it so much especially on weekends.  I called one time and I was told that it will be opened on the month of July.  Well,  it's July.  Is it open now?< /Text>

Best library in the area, in my opinion.  Clean, quiet, well-lighted, well-staffed, spacious, with plenty of computers and plenty of comfortable places to sit (a godsend on hot Summer days, when one needs a quiet place to cool off.)  The small section with tables, where one may eat a lunch, is also nice (I only wish it had more tables, as they fill up quickly.)  The library is also relatively free from unnecessary distractions (such as noisy crazy people), unlike, say, the Sunnyvale Library.  The "Quiet Nook" is another excellent feature of this library, one which I sincerely wish other libraries would adopt:  A nice, quiet, secluded little room by itself with desks equipped with privacy-hutches, and kept mercifully-quiet, for those times when one needs to work free from noise & distractions.  Other useful resources available at this library as well, such as scanners, copiers, etc.  All in all, an excellent library, one which is my first choice for virtually all my library needs.  The only real criticism I can make is the fact that the parking is really not adequate to the needs of the location.  With the numerous special activities going on at either the library, the Swim Center and Central Park, that parking-lot tends to fill up awfully fast and parking soon becomes unavailable (especially when some spaces are blocked-off by Park staff for some bizarre reason.)  There is some underground parking available underneath the library, but it is small & difficult to maneuver in there and also fills up quickly.  What is really needed is a large, multi-level parking-structure for the Library, the Swim Center and Central Park.  I for one would support the construction of such a structure, as I believe it is needed.< /Text>

I love this library. It's clean and modern, with plenty of natural light. There are plenty of places to relax in a comfortable chair and read. There's a little cafe too. And it has a wonderful park behind it. It's just a quiet, happy place for me.</text>

There are so many varieties of books, and the staff is really nice. The comic con is always fun to attend, and the summer reading results in great books to read. This library is the best organized I have ever seen, as the holds are so nicely put together. The park is right next to it, and the library is near a small expand of grass which in you can lay down and read a book. I've been coming here since I was 5, and I l think this is the best library ever!< /text>< Pics>

Email notification of due date has failed for months. Sent inquiry to library but received no response. They didn't care about fixing the new beta system which stopped sending due date notice by email even if you signed up. Ultimately many users get fined when there is no email of reminder. They did not deliver the service as promised. Disappointing.< /text>

This library is sort of small but it was open enough to get some studying in. The lights were turning off every once in a while for some random reason. The employees had to go to the breakers.</Text>

A literary oasis in an otherwise soulless Silicon Valley. This place and Kepler's Books in Menlo Park have helped me feel less alone here as a reader and a writer. Excellent collections, kind and thoughtful librarians, warm and light-filled reading rooms, perfectly paired with the public park, Central Park Library is an excellent place go come catch up on some reading and writing. Highly recommend their audio book selection!</text>

It's a very spacious library with high ceilings, there are plenty of desks and chairs for people to sit and read or work.

Parking can be a little bit challenging during weekends.

The park nearby is a great place to relax, have a walk or have a picnic with families and friends.<//text>

The library is good and has good collection of books. Most of the time I found it full of people. It's not empty at all any time of the day. There are of places to study. The study tables have charging stations. The wifi is also good but if you are connected for long then it may ask for authentication again. The only thing that I think is missing is the group study rooms. They have only 2. There is small cafe inside which is fine.<//text>

It is a perfect place, very cozy, very warm environment but there are two problems, first the opening hour which is at 10 is really late. I would love it if it was opening earlier.
Second, It's always great to have library open, more than working days. I really don't like the opening and closing times on weekends! It's too short!</Review>

A great library in Cupertino. The interior is very nicely decorated. If you are book lover, you can spend a whole day inside the library. The central park is right behind the library. That is also a great place to spend time with kids. We have membership in this library. Only one tiny gripe I have about the online portal of this library is that I cannot transact online (e.g. check my borrowed items extend return dates etc.). However, you can browse the catalog  online.</Review>

The best place to spend time with your kids and yourself! This is our favorite weekend activity. Also a great place to finish homework.
Several events hosted by the library staff keep kids interested and wanting to come back for me.</text>

Beautiful library with friendly staff. The children's section is large and has a good selection. My favorite part is the little outdoor garden area in the children's section. Perfect for squirmy toddlers.< /text>

Great selection of books, there's always something happening (reading clubs, kids' events, book sales, events, etc.,), very well maintained premises, extremely helpful staff, lot of offline resources (ebooks, services, memberships, access to local museums, etc.,)

What else can you ask for?<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Well for starters the people here act like they are so much better then anyone around I mean really the ones at Santana row where nicer than these people and the wifi well I tried playing a game but all I wants to say is sever is not responding that's all I could get out of it and where I had chose to sit which was by the window at a disk that had been used for self check out which isn't that now they try saying I was block the self check out I had told them I was sitting here so that I could see my bike I was tired of people stealing them and that I wasn't blocking any such thing cause the self checkout is about 8 feet away so they walked away just to have the lady cleaning come over and now she needed to clean the area if I could please find another place she didn't say another place to sit just another place I thought this was a public library but its apparent that this is not so here in santa clara the people here are selfish, rude,and uncaring about those who just don't have keeping others down and not caring to help that is the true problem< /Text>

A nice quiet studying place that I go to everyday to do my homework and check my email. I reserved one of the study rooms on the 2nd floor to study in and help my siblings with their homework. The next day I tried to reserve a room again for the same reason but I was denied. I asked why and the lady at the desk said my siblings were too young. But I had no warning of this because apparently only 13 year olds and up are allowed. But there is no sign anywhere saying this. And I have seen toddlers and young children repeatedly in there, and they have not been asked to leave. I told the lady this and she responded with a quite rude comment of saying how they are an exception like I was allowed the privilege of using the room. The library ladies on the second floor believe that they are some sort of law enforcement and are quite boastful and arrogant. I enjoy the library but these few ladies get a bit on my nerves. Sorry had to rant a little.<//Text>

A nice place to study and reading. The even better thing is a coffee shop can be found in the first floor, which is my favorite.< /Text>

Good library! If the library is open until 9 pm, like Cupertino library from 9 am to 9pm , that would be better.</Text>

A very nice public pool! Kids under 7 are free and adults are $6.00. The facilities are updated and the life guard to patron ratio is fabulous! There were so many guards monitoring the two pools. The kiddie pool is a great depth that goes from friendly for learner's to babies (3.0 ft to 3.6 ft back to 3.0- 1.6 ft.) There isn't a lot of shade close to the kiddie pool, but there are umbrellas and the shade from the buildings. A great location to cool off.< /review>

<Text>Grass very well groomed. Fun staff: especially guard that always wears a blue hat, grey shorts, grey sandals. High quality diving board. 10/10 would drive again. Appears that Pool has new covers. Needs more shade especially in parking lot.<//Text>< pictures>

Pool, grass and changing rooms are very nice and clean. Kids pool was closed when we visited and main pool was a little cold for the kids to play in.<//review>

I stopped by placita cafe on my way back to Palm Springs. They have tasty Mexican food and a welcoming staff. I dined in and got the carne asada taco plate with rice and beans which was delicious and the green sauce was perfect with the tacos 👌 Beans and rice were good as well. Will definitely come back.<//text>

<Text>We went for brunch. Not enough people know about this brunch. It's great, the service as always great too. Food was delicious. Our waiter was so nice about the 2 babies that we had in tow... will definitely be going more especially when the weather turns and the patio is open more consistently. We will be back!< /Text>< Pictures>

Visited family in LA and came across this place, so very satisfied we stopped in! The food was amazing and authentic! Best part was how affordable it is! I’m very picky with my food and they by far satisfied my taste buds! My family of 4 ate for $22! Five stars, stop in you’ll be glad you did!<//review>

I told the lady I wanted the asada burrito she said okay but when she was taking my order she kept staring at me which felt uncomfortable. So I was done ordering that burrito and she repeated my order and said yes the order is correct. 15 min wait just for this burrito hoping it would be the best damn thing ever. I didn't check my order before I left because I would've missed the bus which I messed up I should've doubled check on what I got the lady gave me nachos?? I clearly didn't  ask for these what's worst is they didn't even taste good. So yeah never again even my friend didn't eat it she didn't  like them and never again I'll go to this place  even my bf warned me about it as well.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

DO NOT pay this place with your debit or credit card. They ALWAYS yank over $2.00 charge above what their machine prints out.</review>

It is a pity that prices have risen so much.
In just a few months he raised almost $ 3 a wet burrito with soda.
It's not worth coming here and paying 12.55 having other options around

< Review>
I just moved to CA a couple of months ago and needed a groomer for my dog.  Zuri had great reviews, so I decided to try them out.  I booked her bath on the day we were moving into a new house and decided to have her stay for doggie daycare as well.  She had a great time and came out all shiny and soft.  When I went to pay my bill, they told me that the daycare fee was waived since it was our first visit.  What an awesome surprise!  We will be back!</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>We used Zuri for the first time for our wedding this weekend and so glad we did! We’ve always had a close friend watch our 2 dogs ( German Shepard and lab) when we go out of town and never thought about trying a “pet hotel”. Because she was going to be with us, along with all other people we would have trusted, we decided to try Zuri and our family has used them before and loved it. I was so nervous because our dogs can be wild and not very friendly with other dogs but they kept them in private play, gave them so much special time and love!!! They gave them a bath and it was so nice coming home to them being so nice and clean!!! Such a great price and such nice staff! We didn’t have to worry all weekend, we knew they were happy and they smell great!! Thank you so much Zuri!!!< /text>< pics>

It’s so nice knowing Zuri is there for our furry pup. We have a standard poodle puppy who is high energy and loves to get his wiggles out at Zuri. He is a puppy and can sometimes need a nap in the middle of the day. Zuri takes great care of our sweet boy. I love seeing pictures of his day and his daily report card. Plus, we also use their grooming service. The groomer does a great job grooming our poodle. I highly recommend Zuri for your pets daycare and grooming needs. ❤️💯🐩< /review>

I was very happy with Hectors grooming. He was very nice and took time to make sure he could give Chanel a good hair cut. Also to keep her comfortable and safe. He is our new groomer! The front desk girls were kind. Some info I wasn't told. That Hector told me. But nothing to stop me from coming back.< /review>

Boarded my 3 dogs ( 1 senior small dog and 2 large older dogs with bad anxiety) for 12 nights. One of my large dogs had failed the test day at Camp Bow Wow, the other large dog passed but was shaking by the gate the entire time. We decided to try Zuri instead after much research and we are so glad we did. We watched our dogs on the daycare cameras every day- both large dogs did incredible with the other dogs, and the staff were very attentive. More than once we caught staff sitting in the small dog area and petting/playing with dogs. My one large dog with the worst anxiety laid along a wall the entire first day, clearly a little scared. The next day I saw t hat a piece of play equipment had been moved to where she laid the day before where she could hide under the piece of equipment, So they were clearly paying attention to her and felt that would make her more comfortable which was very sweet. All of my dogs upon pickup were not crazy trying to get out like they have been before, they were all calm and we genuinely believe they had an enjoyable stay. We will definitely use them again!< /Review>

I loved the daily “report card” with photos and comments about my dog! And the cameras make it so reassuring to see my dog socializing. I highly recommend Zuri for your dog-sitting needs.</Text>

<review>I was apprehensive about signing my pup up for another daycare. His experience at a previous location was a nightmare, they would isolate him because he was a large breed and the management didn’t like his breed. I brought my pup in to Zuri and he has been the happiest guy ever since! They send me report cards during his stay to communicate how he’s doing and based on his smiling pictures and great report card I can tell Zuri is the right place for my large breed dog. I’m very satisfied so far with their services so far and will continue bringing in my big guy!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

My 4 month old Bernedoodle was well taken care of during his 10 day puppy training camp. It was hard to be away from him, but worth it as he has returned a happy well mannered dog! To top it off, he returned bathed, brushed, and smelling great! Thanks Zuri!</text>

With a very anxious dog when left alone (as sometimes rescues can be), I have found the perfect place for her.  She can romp and play with other doggies and get a little love from sweet humans who are watching over her.</Review>

We love Zuri pet! They take wonderful care of our Frenchie. She is super high energy and a lot to deal with but they always say the sweetest things about her, and she comes home happy and exhausted! We love that we know she’s in great hands while we’re away!</review>

While there are other options for pet care, I choose Zuri because they care about my pet and their pick up and drop off service is a great option when I'm traveling.< /text>

Our fur babies always have an amazing time at Zuri! We have been boarding our pups there for several years. The staff are so friendly and loving to their guests, I never have to worry if they are being treated well. I wouldn't board my pups anywhere else ❤< /Review>

The staff here are so sweet and genuine! I felt so comfortable leaving my pup with them for grooming. They listened to what I wanted the cut to look like, and made sure I was happy with the final product before I left. Aside from the customer service, the prices here are fantastic! Over all very affordable, great quality and service! Will be booking with them again :)< /Text>

My dogs are always healthy and happy upon return. They always return my calls when inquiring about their status.
My only criticism is that drop off and pick up can take longer than you might expect. They are busy</review>

<Review>We’ve been taking our Lab (Hank) to this place for years now. Such a wonderful place and incredibly accommodating.

We were recently evacuated and didn’t have our papers to show Hanks updated records. My wife and I were both called into work so I messaged Jen at 6:00 am. She not only answered but consoled us and personally reached out to the vet to update the records as well as making last minute accommodations.

Wonderful place.< /Review>< rating>

The staff there are kinds, informative and caring, they really take the time in explaining whatever prices you’re looking for and my dogs have burger been more comfortable at any pet resort such as this one. I have three dogs and they’ve haven’t shown any discomfor me happy as one of them is old and particular. The grooming is incredible and they’re all talented, Hector is amazing with my labradoodles’  and he’s a very trusted groomer! I hope he never leaves!

Zuri is the only place I will ever take my dogs. They are incredible and everyone there treats the dogs as if they are their own. I have two German Shepards and just the ability to show my kids them on the cameras and then the report cards is great. They also were able to change my reservation at the last minute and picked them up for me!  This place is a gem!!!</text>

<Text>Absolutely loved the grooming & toe trim done on my Two dogs. The groomer HECTOR listen to my request and did the best trim  Dash has ever had. He was really sweet. And Lola was groomed also and I’m so pleased. She got her black nails trimmed. Normally they don’t  dare cut them much because they are black. But nice job 👍 Thanks Zuri I’ll be back and I’ll let everyone know how pleased I was!!</Text>< pics>

Wonderful experience with Daycare; the resort was friendly and helpful checking us in for our first visit and made us feel confident that our dog would have a positive day. The cams were a big help to making me feel confident that he was enjoying himself and that he was being monitored by a friendly, watchful staff member. He came home happy as could be and smelling great (thought I was going to have to wipe him down after all the "greeting," but seems they did that for us)!< /Text>

Wiley loves going to Zuri! From when you walk
In the front door the employees are so attentive,
The store is very clean and Wiley is so comfortable.
As you may know Aussies are  nervous dogs and he is very relaxed there.  I would highly recommend
The Zuri Pet Spa
Thank you so much!

<Text>They were very helpful getting us in to doggy day care, even though we had an issue with our vet’s vaccination records- we were able to clear it up, but the staff went above and beyond. Our pup came back tired and happy, and we were happy too! Not needing to go for a long walk to tire out a cooped up dog after a day at the beach was excellent.< /Text>< pics>

Zuri takes the time and care to do the best grooming job. I find the people to be extremely kind, helpful, and my pup comes out looking great!  We rescued our dog from them as well, so I love how much they give back.  We ❤️ Zuri!</review>

I visited for the first time today with my large golden doodle. They made her look adorable! She also had so much fun there, playing with other dogs. It was the best haircut she’s gotten at an extremely reasonable price. I found my go-to groomer!< /text>

Thank you Zuri pet spa for taking my dog in for a major grooming on such a short notice. My lab looks absolutely beautiful!
I think everyone who is able, should  come into Zuri and support them. That way they will be here when we need them in the future.
Thank you Zuri and your crew for doing an awesome job.

These people are awesome. True professionals that Will take care of your dog as their own, and really bend over backwards in order to help you live your best life with your pet. I travel a ton, and always on last minute notice. They always take good care of my boy, even when I notify them 15 minutes before I’m going to drop him off. I could not have a dog without them. Truly the best.</review>

If you’ve never been or treated your pet to an experience here, you’re missing out. Top notch facility and people. Support them during these times, your pet will thank you! My bully loves going and visiting all his friends. He literally runs out the door when we’re going to Zuri. All their services are great... boarding , daycare, bathing etc. Thanks Zuri!<//text>

The groomer actually talks to you about what kind of cut you want for your little buddy.  They are very knowledgeable. For instance, I didn’t know you’re not suppose to cut a puppy’s hair before they turn a year old.  My old groomer never told me that.  I highly recommend Zuri Per Spa.</text>< pics>

<text>Zuri provided boarding and daycare for our 4 dogs. They all came home relaxed and happy, no stress detected. Loved that they offer a complimentary shampoo for boarding 2 nights or more.
Zuri was also open when other pet boarder/daycare locations were closed. We will definitely use Zuri Pet Spa again!<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dcf1e24fcd405d:0xf005d17bd9511386</gmapID></record>

I got my dog from Zuri Pet Rescue and also used them for day care while we had movers at our house. Our dog had a great time, was very tired after and was happy to go back a second time. She is timid so they kept her in a room with fewer dogs. She did great! I think it’s actually easier to get her into the car now because she thinks she’s going to Zuri, haha.</text>

The team at Zuri takes such great care of our dog Shadow. He’s naturally a timid dog and we started taking him to Zuri to help get him comfortable with different people and stay socialized with other dogs. They take the time to let us know how he’s doing with report cards and when we pick him up for the day. Their additional services like nail dremmel and baths are great because we don’t have an easy way to do these tasks at home and the groomers are gentle (and give him a jaunty neck bandanna).</review>

We dosed our dog with red cedar oil to kill/remove any fleas that he may have picked up on his walk this morning. When I came to pick him up, the owner said he had to double check that they washed him as he could still smell the cedar oil. I appreciated his concern! All employees are nice as can be. We'll be taking Ernie to you from now on. Thank you!!<//review>

The friendly staff goes out of their way to throw the balls/toys during daycare keeping the dogs active and give extra pets and love all day. Treats them like their own! Never felt stressed or worried during his boarding stay, and he came back fluffy and smelling great after a long weekend of boarding which included a bath!< /review></record>

Very flexible and professional. They don't force the dogs to play in a group if he/she isn't feeling it. The employees pay attention to  what each dog needs.</Review>

We 'day boarded' our pup while work was done on our home.  As he is a rescue, he does better on his own rather than in the play groups. The staff was kind, and caring and even sent me photos taken of him while he was taken on a walk!  Thanks....< /Review>

We rescue Basset Hounds and Zuri has been invaluable in dealing with each hounds special needs in Daycare, Boarding and Grooming. As if they don't do enough good, They run a Terrific Rescue of there own. 5 Star place with 5 star folks. What else ya lookin’ for?<//text>

I wish I would have known about Zuri sooner.  Clean, and great accommodations for your dogs.  My dog stayed there while he was in training with Sit means Sit.  This I would also highly recommend if you have any issues with your dog, or just want you’re puppy to be in training.  Just could not be happier.< /review>

<review>This is by far the absolute best place I’ve ever taken my dog. The staff are respectful, the owners truly care, and my dog is unusually happy to be there when I have to take her there. I love how clean it is and how my dog is constantly being played with and taken care of. Very pleased with zuri!<//review>< pictures>

Our pets are treated like family when visiting Zuri Pet Spa. My two fur babies love going 'home' to see the loving staff and play with their extended dog family. I can't say enough great things about Zuri Pet Spa and their incredible Pet Rescue! I drive from L.A. for Zuri services and have met other clients who have done the same, that says a lot about the Zuri organization... simply the BEST.< /Text>

ZURI pet spa seems like an extension of my own family. My dogs are my fur babies, and I don’t trust them with just anyone. Without ZURI, my life would be much harder and my babies wouldn’t have their fun day at the spa. Thank you Zuri!!! XO The Kiley Family<//review>

I will never bring my dogs to the Zuri pet spa & resort! Any company that employs drivers/groomers that drive like complete maniac's is not a place I can trust with my dogs!
I was with my wife going north on Camino De Estrella at the freeway intersection over the 5 freeway on February 4th between 4:00 and 4:45 PM. In the far right lane, "the must turn right lane", a woman in a Zuri pet spa van pulled up to the intersection where she should've gotten on the 5 going south. When the light changed we merged over to the right like other law abiding citizens. This nut job lady decided she was going to charge through the intersection almost causing an accident. In the midst of this woman's road rage she whips her van to the left, accelerates as if she's in NASCAR, then proceeds to aggressively cut me and everyone else off! Seriously, if I had an employee that acted with such dangerous adolescent behavior I wouldn't hesitate to terminate her.
This woman is a liability to your company and her behavior needs to be addressed or you could be held liable for an accident she gets in.</Review>

We've been going with Zuri Pet Spa for the past couple months & each time we have had a wonderful experience! The driver is great in handling our big St. Bernard Riley. Every time I have called the office to make an appointmemt for Riley, we are greeted with a kind & polite receptionist. Once we did have an issue, but it was quickly resolved by the the manager. She was very attentive to hear our issue out and was quick to find a solution. With such wonderful customer service that we received through the resolution of our issue, we have decided to continue with Zuri Pet Spa & never looked back! They have great promotions: discounts, pick up/ drop off, one day of free doggy daycare, etc. Most importantly our dog Riley comes home happy & beautiful from her grooming. Thank you Zuri Pet Spa for taking care of our dog & giving the entire family a good experience. :)</review>

A very professional and caring organization!!! They do it all... From Pet Spa Treatments to Pet Adoptions and most everything in between... I personally highly recommend this place... I have a friend that works for this place, I have done volunteer work at adoption events, and the whole organization from behind the doors is THE BEST!!! These animals are treated better than us in most cases... Plus the adopted pets are all RESCUES from "KILL SHELTERS" so that they could have a second chance!!! And that makes me feel so much better!!! It just gets me right here(in my heart)... I<//text>

Got Dogs nails Dremel Trimmed. Happy Dog and Happy Me. No more accidental nail scratches on my petting arm. Cost $15.

Make sure and have your Dogs Medical and License Info sent to them ahead of time. If you use Petco's Vetco for shots they or you can have the records emailed over.

Will use Zuri again.< /text>

I made an appointment for my dog with Zuri, but when we showed up they informed me (and not at the time I made the appointment) that my dog needed to have all his vaccinations updated.
When I went to walk out the door they said, "Oh don't worry about it this time, we will just take him!"
Fearing that there was a reason for my dog needing to be vaccinated, I decided against letting them break their own policy (why have a mandatory vaccination policy, then let people in regardless?), and took my dog to the vet, where we got his vaccinations done. After that, I took him back to Zuri and checked my dog in for his grooming.
5.5 Hours later (how in the world does it take 5 hours to wash a dog?) my dogs eyes and face were swollen shut, an allergic reaction from the vaccinations, but NOBODY at Zuri commented on the fact that this was happening.
While my dog was in their care, I feel like he wasn't taken care of. He was clean yes, but his face was swollen shut and he was running a fever and freaking out, traumatized from the allergic reaction and nobody noticing...
Not a single employee said anything to me about his condition. So very disappointed that the people that work for Zuri didn't care enough to notice what was happening with my dog's health.

We will not be coming back! And we will be letting anybody we talk to know just how little care was actually shown to our animal while under the careless eye of Zuri employees.<//Text>

We bring our pup to ZPS often and each time we come in the front desk staff (+Bryan) is super helpful, responsive and kind with us and our dog at checkin and checkout. The online cams are helpful during the day as well as a nice report card and pictures of our dog at the end of the day make for a good experience. Having the dogs at ZPS split into large and small dogs is also a big bonus for us all. Good experiences overall. Recommend +++<//text>

<review>We took our very active Belgian Malinois puppy for his first grooming/bath.  They were wonderful and he had a marvelous time.  For a dog who absolutely HATES water and is a royal pain to bathe they are lifesavers.  I guess they know the way to get him comfortable since he sure seems happy to be there.  We will be back soon!<//review>< Gmap_id>

My dog got kennel cough, despite having her shots. My friends sweet sharpe was mailed and almost killed by a boxer. There only one girl in the room at the time. They dropped the dog off st the vet and called her. They never met her there or called her after. Her dog could have died...  I don't recommend taking your dog here.<//text>

This restaurant is just near by Hotel Pickwick that i stay. Simple decoration, place is quite small. Waiting time is long since i saw only 2 chief is there. About the foods, it's excellent. Well, i suggest they should add some chief to provide good n fast service. Check out the photos.< /Review>

My favorite sushi restaurant in downtown San Francisco. The restaurant is small and cozy. They have a great selection of sushi - vegetarian, cooked and raw sushi.  The prices  are typical of sushi restaurants - specialty rolls are usually 12 and up. They also have a alcohol menu so you can buzzed or drunk as you eat sushi. My favorite is the vegetarian sushi - the deli maki roll which consists of deep fried sweet potato, avocado and cream cheese. It is creamy and sweet. The second favorite is the Lion king.

Treat yourself and dine in because the chef uses brightly colored sauces to decorate the plates/boards. Not only that, the sauces go wonderfully with the sushi.  Because if the care that went into the presentation, it makes you feel like you are eating at a high-class sushi restaurant.<//text>

I can only rate for what I had, which is vegetarian bento box. It's good value, but the tofu is way too sweet. So overall it's a bit average. I like the house sake though, pretty good and inexpensive.</Text>

<review>Food was decent but slow to serve, I went to a really slow time between 1:30pm and 2:30pm and either way took them a lot to serve it, the fish was not overdue but not fresh and the roll was more avocado then fish, little disappointed.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAZFbybmh4KyZjyp02ZKeiB6qKpz_HuiVDe7Xm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGC3CV0oH4PfTAhGy-H8uxfB2j2ODMtceccDW3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>{'time': 1552254871054, 'text': 'Thanks for your feedback we will take attention to improve our service and we hope to serve you again.'}< /Response>< gmapID>

The food was phenomenal. I got the ramen and my friend got the bento box and the prices were in our range! However, while we tried to explain how to split our check, the female server was rude and basically shut us up and told us to just give her the cards and she will figure out. She ended up switching our meals and charging the wrong cards, and instead of apologizing, she acted haughty and annoyed. She said “it’s only a 2 dollar difference it’s not a big deal”. A good restaurant is nothing with bad waitresses.< /Review>

Such an awesome little sushi place! We had a 2 hour layover in San Francisco and took the Bart Train downtown. I'm so glad we did! Awesome sushi, fast friendly service, decent prices. If I ever make it back to San Fran, that it where I'm going.< /review>

This is a very small place, but the staff inside is very friendly and attentive. They even extended happy hour for my group of co-workers and gave us free appetizers which was really nice. I will definitely be back if/when I go back to San Francisco.< /Review>

I'd say this isn't the worst Sushi I've ever had in my entire life but it definitely was not near even medium quality. The tuna was pretty flavor flavorless and the pieces fell apart - not just the pieces of sushi but the fish itself which leads me to think that it wasn't cut by an expert. For a quick fix of sushi in the area it was decent but definitely not worth the price.< /review>

<Review>Great sushi! Fresh, good atmosphere, friendly staff who were very flexible in changing tv stations to March Madness basketball (instead of tennis. Audy, the owner, checked on us frequently and was extremely friendly to our 6 year old daughter. 4 of us dined there, 3 adults and one 6 year old. We come to SF quite a bit from Sacramento and will definitely be returning to Kaisen Sushi.
4 stars instead of 5 because the space is sort of small and the restroom is in the adjacent hotel, so you have to go outside of the restaurant to go wash your hands. Not sure that's the restaurant's fault but that's my reason for the 4 stars.</Review>< resp>

This is the worst sushi I've ever had. They messed up our order and sent the completely wrong thing, which happens. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and had them send the correct order. It came, but nothing had any flavor. The foods individually didn't even taste how they were supposed to. I hope this was just a bad night for them!<//review>

Ordered take out. sushi was fine but salmon teriyaki was inedible.  Covered in crushed whole black peppercorns.  Embedded in fish so we could not remove them... which means that was all you can taste.  And that after having to wait 40 mins for food after they told me on phone it would be 20 mins.  They don't offer refunds over the phone so check your food before you leave unless you want to go back.  We won't be.</text>

<Review>I've walked by this place often on my way to and from Westfield and the City Target and have been meaning to stop by. Finally did last night after a little shopping spree... and I was not impressed. While it it is conveniently located with convenient hours (open post movie and shopping times), the food was very so-so. I was originally dazzled by the extensive menu, but I quickly remembered how restaurants, esp Asian ones, that claim to provide everything, often do not make everything in house. We had miso soup - which was decent, but also possibly instant. He had a plate of sashimi, I had the Oh My God Volcano. The presentation was lovely but the taste was A-ok.< /Review>< Pics>

I'm Korean who grew up eating real, authentic, best quality sashimi internationally. I must say, I'm not going to this restaurant to order Sashimi, particularly.
1. They were sliced in such a clumsy way, they looked distasteful.
2. Taste was awful - sashimi is not supposed to taste like fish smell. The smell of stink fish was vibrating my tonge and my mouth. I could totally tell they were old, low-quality sashimi fishes. Whoever the chief is, needs to educate himself to how to deliver fresh, good quality sashimi to customers.</text>

im am no big sushi eater but my boss had taken us here for lunch one day and introduced me and my co-workers to the "cowboy-roll" its a sliice of kobe beef on top of salmon sushi drizled with thier barbeque sauce. when i first tried it my reaction was "What is this party in my mouth!" "This is awesome!" who would have thought to pair those togeather. if you are in the mood for sushi really go there and try that roll.<//Text>

However, it is a pity that the quantity is small (also with other Japanese restaurants)

A gentle spinning ride that immerses you in bright pastel colors.  Great for young kids.  8 carriages total, 4 adults per carriage.  Each party will get their own carriage however.< /Text>

If this ride seems familiar to you it’s because this is the old Flik‘s Flyer from the former Bug‘s Land. Makes for a cute ride and the colors at night are really pretty, but I wouldn’t wait longer than 15min to ride it. Nice addition to Pixar Pier.<//Text>

This place is designed more for kids. Adults can have fun enjoying the ambience but I love majority of the rides here. Can't go wrong with a short line and a smooth ride.<//Text>

<review>My kids love this ride but oh my goodness if you get any sort of motion sickness avoid this ride. Sitting in the "backwards seat" is not good. Otherwise it's very cute staying in theme as you ride in little boxes of snacks in Flik's homemade flying contraption.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>A very fun ride for the young ones that older ones can enjoy as well. Always a short line, this is the best way to introduce a child to a small flight in the air. Plus the theme can't be beat. Bug's Land is where it's at.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>The ride is short and not very exciting but it's average fun for little kids.  I liked the creativity in the ride architecture though, like the pie tin, whipped topping container, and raisin boxes, etc.  Really makes you feel like you're a bug!</text>< Pics>

<Text>It's your basic ride. The thing goes up and then spins around. The ride feels a little short but it seems great for kids. The line is also much shorter then other rides in the park. It's a nice easy ride.<//Text>< pics>

This ride was cute and the theming was very good, but we had to wait for quite a while, and the ride was disappointingly short. Also our 2-year-old thought it was pretty boring, but maybe that's just her.</review>

Like every other Denny's. It's good. The only thing is the waitress may have had too many customers and forgot 2 of my items, and when she finally brought them,  I was almost ready to leave.<//Text>

Awful cold food. Attitude and slow service at this location.
Dennys is good over all but THIS location  doesn't care about their customers< /text>

The night female employee has horrible service. She had attitude as soon as we walked in. She did not offer refills at all. She never asked how we are doing other then when she took the order. The food wasn't bad other then when a different person dwliverwd it to our table he didnt understand when i asked for A.1. Sauce. He said the waitress woild be with us and that didnt happen. When my friend attempted to order her response was "we are out if that for a month" on 2 different items but 20 min later the table across from us ordered the same items. When it came time to pay I waited 15 min at the register while she stood down the isle texting on her cell. She seen me but didnt care. Had the nerve to ask to answer what percentage of a tip did I want to leave on the credit card screen. Sad cause I loved this place years ago. Never again.</Review>

<Text>The night female employee has horrible service. She had attitude as soon as we walked in. She did not offer refills at all. She never asked how we are doing other then when she took the order. The food wasn't bad other then when a different person dwliverwd it to our table he didnt understand when i asked for A.1. Sauce. He said the waitress woild be with us and that didnt happen. When my friend attempted to order her response was "we are out if that for a month" on 2 different items but 20 min later the table across from us ordered the same items. When it came time to pay I waited 15 min at the register while she stood down the isle texting on her cell. She seen me but didnt care. Had the nerve to ask to answer what percentage of a tip did I want to leave on the credit card screen. Sad cause I loved this place years ago. Never again.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Service was good, food as well. Ordered a salad and they forgot to put tomatoes on it. So I asked if they could please fix it and they did. Place is clean. Not sure if there is a restroom here though, I don't think there is one< /Review>

After receiving my order, I overheard employees bemoaning how sauces/ingredients weren't dated, which didn't inspire much confidence in the franchise and products. The lettuce was browning and didn't taste fresh. The wrap I received, whilst being made by a trainee associate receiving training, was 30-40% smaller than I'm accustomed to. I chose Togo's for my meal due to their (historically) filling portions and fresh ingredients, but this location didn't live up to those expectations. Neither Sun Chips nor Coke Zero were available as well. One star for the wrap still tasting alright despite it's size and brown lettuce, another for the friendly staff.< /Text>

They cheat you out of cash because the soda machine is out of order (so they say). They charge extra for a combo and you don't get the 20oz in the combo, it's a 16oz. Bottle and it's not refillable. I wont be returning any time soon.</text>

I have used this Company twice to clean my carpets and once to clean a chair and they have alway been on time, friendly and professional. The prices are extremely affordable and the carpets and the chair have been super clean when they are done. I have tried one other company and there is no comparison!

<text>Had a great first time experience using Heaven's Best Carpet Cleaning.  I usually use another company but happened upon their 5-Star yelp reviews and gave them a try.  My experience from start to finish was 5-Stars - I called Monday morning and Alex was at my house the next day at 2:30 sharp.  It took him about an hour to clean my master and living room area rug.

I had a couple of pet urine and vomit stains from a few years that weren't able be cleaned in the past using the steam method - Heaven's Best technique got all the stains out, they don't use steam and therefore doesn't saturate the carpet and it was dry in about an hour - (probably drys faster in the summer when it's hot)

Alex was friendly, professional and fast. They are now my new go to carpet cleaning company moving forward.  I highly recommend them!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

So excited to let everyone know what an amazing company this is! Called last minute with family coming and a carpet that literally looked like it should of been replaced when we moved in! Cream colored carpet that looked brown.  The owner came out and did it himself and I was literally speechless! Carpet does not need to be replaced and so happy I made the call! Great results and Professional service!! Call them you won't be disappointed!</text>

Chris was great--on time and professional. Chris set my expectations by explaining what he planned to do, what to expect (and what not to expect). Then, Chris did it faster and cheaper than estimated. I would definitely use Heaven's Best again!<//review>

These guys are great! We use them for our Commerical property and they are always prompt, reasonably priced, and do a quality job.

This time I had a mix up with the address I gave them and they were super accommodating. They rescheduled me in less than 24 hours and still provided the same great service.

Thanks Dan and Chris! You guys are the best!< /Text>

I had a great experience with Heaven’s Best Carpet Cleaning. I had some very dirty areas and I wasn’t expecting them so come completely clean, but they did! I have 2 cats and they had an organic and natural treatment process and it didn’t leave a residue. I would definitely use them again.<//Review>

I have always used Heaven’s Best. I always requested to have John do my carpet and couch cleaning. He is always on time and I can trust him in my home. The products they use are really great. They always do a great job.
I have had to call them on several occasions in an emergency. They were able to come right out.
I highly recommend Heaven’s Best. Especially John.
It’s obvious he loves his job and working for them!<//Text>

We used Heaven's Best, in Folsom, for our home in West Sacramento. The company was able to come out for a same day appointment, and John did an excellent job. He was on time, worked hard, and we got a great price. Highly recommend! Will use them again.<//Review>

The new owner and staff have continued the same level of excellent service as did the original owner.  Not only is their work always perfect, above and beyond ones expectations, John Hodges, my service person is fabulous.  I trust him so much, he is like family, a delightful young man and his work ethic is of the highest standard.  I use their service twice a year like clockwork, and it is such a relief to have someone I can trust come into my home.
Thank you John and thank you Heaven's Best for your absolute perfect service!!<//Review>< pictures>

I’ve been using Heaven’s Best Carpet Cleaners for years and will never use anyone else. The on time service with a smile is impeccable and my carpets are back to almost new when cleaned. The drying time is quick and allows me to move freely around the house with out waiting all day like other steam cleaning services. Very impressed with Heaven’s Best! Stacy<//review>

<Text>Heavens Best made the carpet cleaning process a breeze from start to finish.

Communication was easy, they are upfront about pricing, the prices are below what I was expecting, and the service was terrific, noninvasive, and FAST! The results are awesome. Nice soft clean carpet, no more pet/mystery stains.

Dan is great and it was a pleasure to work with the owner of a small local business.<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Name>

It was over a year ago I had Heaven's Best come out to clean our carpets. I didn't write a review because I wasn't sure how well it would hold up. Because many times my husband would rent a shampooer to clean our carpets. They would look great at first and with in a week the stains would come back.
Well if you are looking to see your carpets look new again and stay that way please do not hesitate to have Heaven's Best clean your carpets.
They even gave me a bottle of the cleaner they used on my carpets.
It  helped me keep my carpets looking great for almost a year now. We only had them clean 3 rooms using their special offer. Now we are having them clean the whole house.
Also I highly recommend John. He works really hard to hit every area  so you are left very satisfied with his work.< /text>

John did an excellent job and even removed a few spots the last guy claimed were permanent. I was impressed with the results of the low moisture system. It's been a month now and everything still looks very good. Always nice to have a trustworthy and reliable technician. And the carpets dried fast!</Text>

Heaven's best is the only carpet company I use for my home and as a professional Realtor for my clients. There is never any surprises and the work they do is always on time and on budget. The thing i like the most is they don't soak your carpet, it dries in no time. The staff is very pleasant and courteous and Dan the owner stands by his work. Use Heavens Best you will you be happy you did.< /Review>

John arrived on time and went over every detail of the work he was going to do.  He was very detail oriented and explained how his cleaning system worked and the differences and similarities with other systems.  He thoroughly vacumed the house first and then used his cleaning tools to clean all of the designated carpets.  The work was done efficiently and in a timely  manner.  The price was very fair, and I would not hesitate to use Heavens Best again and recommend them to others.< /text>

I heard from a co-worker about how great Heaven's Best Carpet cleaning did the job at their house. I called Heaven's Best after the holidays and set an appointment. The carpet Tech John (very nice guy) came and clean my carpet. It smells great and looks FANTASTIC! I like their services very much. Plus, John gave me an extra cleaning solution and supplies for free. Since then, I recommended to my friends and co-workers Heaven's Best for carpet cleaning. Thank you John :).</review>

Dan is incredibly reliable. I called last minute and he arrived prior to the appointment. He and his son were very personable, professional and polite. They use a different meathod for carpet cleaning, not the tradition "soak and vacuum". Heavens Best is the best I've ever used. My carpets need to be replaced, but they got them looking new again. I recommend Heavens Best for everyone. Well done Dan! Thank you!< /Text>

Heavens Best is a top notch organization.  They were prompt and on time to clean our carpets and floors when we were selling our home.  The results added value to our home to such a large extent that we sold it for more than we had hoped for.

Heaven's Best did an outstanding job cleaning our carpets.  We needed our carpets cleaned for the holidays and Dan was able to schedule our cleaning on the same day we called.  John, the Heaven's Best technician called to update us on his arrival time, so we knew exactly when to expect him.   John was detailed, courteous, and professional.  We were considering replacing our carpets due to the wear and tear of two dogs and kids.  However, now they look refreshed and John was able to remove all the stains that were driving us crazy.  Thank you Heaven's Best!< /Review>

I was skeptical of 5 stars because usually businesses are never that good, but this one truly is. Like others have said, request John. He is absolutely amazing, such a great guy. He even helped us unload a big box from our truck because we were moving. He goes that extra mile. I don’t normally leave reviews, but he deserves it. I will call John every time in the future. Thank you!</review>

It's really hard to find honest reliable work.  John delivered a grand slam on service and professionalism.  I highly recommend Heaven's Best to anyone.  There service is remarkable.  John got stains out I never though he could.  His knowledge of the product and process he uses is well above anyone else.  Please take the time to call Heaven's Best if you truly want the best service.<//text>

Excellent service, showed up on time, , was very clear about what needed to be done, was very thorough. John did an excellent job and we will use Heavens Best again. I highly recommend this company to anyone who needs their carpets professionally cleaned by a company they can trust! We have had plenty of issues with nightmare carpet cleaning "offers" that ended up costing hundreds more than promised and did not give the results we expected. John was professional, efficient, sincere, and made my wife feel very comfortable about having him in our home!< /Text>

I recently had my carpets cleaned by Heaven's Best and was very happy with the job they did for me. It was incredible how my dirty carpets could look so clean once they were through with them. They vacuumed the carpet for me unlike previous companies who made me vacuum my carpets before they did their job which was a pleasant surprise for me.  This was definitely the best experience I have had with getting my carpets cleaned and will surely use them again the next time my carpets need to be cleaned.</review>

I will definitely use Heaven's Best again. I was skeptic at first of their "dry in one hour" claim, but in just a little over one hour, my living room carpets as well as my bedroom's smelled fresh and came out like new! They were very professional when they arrived and did an excellent job. They even left me a free complementary spotter bottle. I would highly reccomend this company.<//review>

The carpet was stained and ten tears old.  They arrived on time and did a fast and exceptional job.  The carpet looks brand new.  They also cleaned my tile and grout the same day.  I was surprised to see the original grout color again in the traffic areas. I would use them  again and referred Heavens Best to family and friends.<//review>

I had been putting off cleaning my carpets because I feared the trouble and expense.  Heaven's Best made the experience as painless as possible.   My call was immediately answered by the owner who bent over backwards to accommodate me.  I needed my carpets cleaned right away as I had guests coming, and he sent John the next morning.  John takes carpet cleaning seriously!  If you meet him you will know what I mean - the man takes pride in what he does.  He went the extra mile by helping me move mattresses and vacuuming under my beds.  He went over the charges before starting the job and again after finishing.  My carpets did not feel soaked like I would have expected after carpet cleaning.  They dried incredibly fast and look fabulous.< /text>

<Text>The team at Heavens Best really came through!

I had renters who didn't have the same level of "cleanliness" that many of us share.  So to say the carpets needed a cleaning is an understatement.  Stains, spots, pet urine... uggghhh!!!

John (the technician) came out and WOW! the difference is amazing.  My carpets were clean again, and all but one spot was completely removed.

Then, one week later, we accidently spilled some wall paint.  He was back within two hours and saved the day.  This is the kind of customer service you always hoped for.   Thank you, Heavens Best.  - Doug<//Text>< Rate>

<time>1491261622156<//time><Text>We were looking for help fast as we had a bad experience thur 3/30  with a different company. I spoke with the Owner Dan who was very helpful and did some rescheduling to fit us in at 2pm A young man named John explained everything he was going to do and went to work. John not only cleaned our carpet beautifully , he also returned our sofa and chair to their original white beauty. John did a great job for us and will have us as new regular customers. John was very knowledgeable regarding his products and processes and kept us informed. We would recommend Heavens Best for any floor or furniture cleaning. Very fair pricing and they are prompt and thorough. Thanks Jim & Guylene Humphries</Text>< name>

<review>In preparation for selling our house we needed a thorough carpet cleaning. The carpet is about 20 years old and has staining and odors from dogs, cats, and general wear and tear. John arrived right on time and explained everything he would be doing as well as the results I could expect. I was very happy with the work he did!  While it wasn't possible to make each stain completely disappear it is the best cleaning we have had to date. I will say, however, that the "dry in 1 hour" is a little misleading because that depends on numerous factors, i.e. ambient venilation, use of fans, sun exposure. There were some areas that took a few hours to dry. I would certainly call them again.<//review><UserId.>104469803179547474413< /UserId.><date>1433087449944</date>< user_name>

Horrible customer service when you need it. I just made the worst purchase from Ashley of a Rock Ridge Accent Cabinet. So about the unit itself the doors are uneven, the paint is chipped so my wife doesn't wanted. What they don't tell you is that there are no refunds only credit towards another purchase. What they also don't tell you is that someone needs to come out and inspect the item and who knows when that will be. My excitement in receiving my item has now turned to anger. I hate that Ashley is souring what used to be a good relationship.< /Text>

<Text>I cannot speak for all of Ashley Home Stores, but I would avoid this Yorba Linda one. The prices they had in store were insanely higher than ones from their very own website. Like, 40% higher, even with their "discount." So be ready to do your homework on their website.<//Text><Date>1619996912558<//Date>< GmapID>

<text>I thought it was strange the online price is cheaper than the supposed sale price in the store.  If you don't know or check they will sell it to you at the higher price. That's shady.  Quality of the furniture was just ok. Salesperson was nice though.  Bring a calculator and reading glasses for all the fine print.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5Or_cB5ldK1o2aOVgEMEpr6tUryY6ezgtkUbR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>I had purchased a dining room set 2 years ago and a crack developed in one the chairs back pieces. Further inspection found filler and paint inside of crack. The crack was filled then painted at factory. Customer service told me warranty was expired and they could not help me even though it is a manufacturer defect. After several 1 hour phone calls to customer service for a replacement part for cracked piece of chair they can only send out a 2nd technician to again tell me my chair is cracked due to manufacturers defect and they cannot help me. After contacting Ashley parts the piece in question is $15. They put me through a customer service nightmare for a $15 dollar part. I ordered part myself and will fix it myself, otherwise I will have to pay a technician replace it even though they sold it to me with a manufacturer defect.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Horrible horrible customer service. We bought our couch June 2020, had issues with their delivery so the manager at the store (Ali) told us to pay the delivery fee in cash out of our own pocket and we would be reimbursed the full amount of $299.99. It is now Feb 2021. They managed to refund the partial amount and we are still owed $141.04. Tried contacting the store multiple times and they refer you to someone else who refers you to someone else. Lesson learned. Never pay anything out of pocket. I will never do business with Ashley furniture again especially the Yorba Linda store. I have now been referred to a person named Andrea from customer service who is also avoiding me, not calling me back and not answering my emails. Save yourself the trouble and go with a different company. If I could give less than 1 star I would.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Ordered living room furniture back in Nov. 2020 at the Yorba Linda store.  Was told it would be delivered by the first week of January.  I have been calling once a week to see the status of the delivery, and I keep getting the same answer:  still waiting on a couple of pieces, and they push the delivery date back 2 weeks.  At the point where I just want to get a refund.< /text>< Pictures>

My husband and I keep going back! We recently bought a mattress from Ashley Furniture and the staff was very friendly, and helpful. I was a little apprehensive because we wanted a TemperPedic and you know $$$. The sales associate was very patient with me and gave us the literal space that we needed to sit and talk and decide to move forward with a purchase. Then when we decided YES we made our purchase and the store manager gave us an unexpected and very HANDSOME store credit $$$. Fast forward to two weeks ago we returned to purchase a new sectional. Again, the staff was extremely helpful, funny, and patient as we browsed. The sales associate made sure to compare the in-store prices with the online prices and gave us the best deal possible plus the 50% OFF promotion. We left extremely happy and are awaiting our new furniture. We highly recommend Ashley Furniture and thank the staff for all their help.< /Text>

<Text>DO NOT BUY from ashly furniture store.
I made a purchase on Jan 4, 2022. I was given  16 Feb 2021 delivery date. Today is March 29, 2021. Not product in site yet.
They are rude, irresponsible, they hang up on you.
Save yourself the hassle and buy somewhere else.
I'll update in neer future.
Up dating; finaly they called that your funiture is ready on April 1, 2021. At the time of purchase I told them that the only day that I can receive them is on a monday. But they couldn't deliver on monday the fifth. Now we have a deliver date of April 12, 2021.
Will update again.</Text><rating>1< /rating><UserId.>106986411541159465567</UserId.>< gmap_id>

<Text>If you want terrible customer service, misinformation / lies or lack of commen sense then this your store! The sales rep Angel is a liar and we'll do just about anything for a sale. So far I've been given 3 different days for my merchandise arrival and still haven't received any of it. The manager Charles is of no help after I was told I was going to receive a refund in full he said he had to wait until he figured out what was going on before he can process the refund. I notified my credit card company and fortunately they do have my best interest in mind they stated they would charge back the transaction for me if I don't receive all my merchandise by the date agreed upon.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Working with this company has been nothing short of frustrating! I wish I would have looked at all the 1 star reviews before walking into the showroom. I have never dealt with worse customer service and scheduling issues, it’s an embarrassment. I walked in the Yorba Linda store on the first week of November with install dates in late November and Mid December, here we are in the 3rd week of January and my item got rescheduled AGAIN one hour before it was supposed to be delivered. The worst part is that management in the Scheduling department is “unavailable” and the Yorba Linda store can’t do anything to help. The left hand doesn’t know what the right is doing at this company. Unless you don’t mind countless phone calls, reschedules, missed days from work, drives to the showroom, and headaches, STAY AWAY from this company. Go spend your money somewhere else.

We were JUST looking, I had a list of what we wanted to look at.  Bill Morrison greeted us and told us where to look.  I told this was our first stop and we were just looking.  He left us alone which I appreciated.  We got to the point where we had questions so we asked him.  Bottom line we got a GREAT deal and it’s being delivered in a week and a half!!!  Lol.  Ask for Bill, he’s great!< /Text>

Nothing can describe my disappointment to this store and their stuff.... I’m so upset with my purchase experience over there. Be cautious, the salesperson will never serve you any more once you paid. The ladies sitting in the customer service area are useless and RUDE.

I have ordered a mattress, a bed, a sofa, a loveseat in November. The salesperson incorrectly put “ship altogether until everything available” when he submit the order and told me he will have someone call me the second day to reschedule to deliver earlier available ones to me first and of course I never got the call. I called store back 10 times, they either told me to have the sales call me back or they couldn’t do anything... of course the sales didn’t call me. I’m so frustrated, I have to wait until end of year for $5000 I spent in Nov. I wasted too much time with them calling and calling... I also have a dining table that I ordered same day but in a different order that was scheduled to come in today... guess what, I was waiting at home and nobody showed up, I called the store and they told me it was rescheduled to late Dec too and they don’t know why... I just couldn’t believe it. I’m really done with them. Be careful, especially when you want a good price, you get no service.<//Text>

Ashely furniture has the worst customer service ever!  They lie to you and sell you furniture that is not available. They don't even call to follow up to tell you your furniture is not available and not going to be delivered.  They just keep rescheduling and rescheduling you over and over.  Making you waste your time waiting around for nothing. I will never do business with them again.</text>

The store itself is nice.  Most of the staff are friendly.  AFTER we paid for our selections, it was DOWN. HILL. FROM. THERE.  I would have changed stores to ANYONE other than an Ashley Home Store.  When my husband went in to complain the MANAGER was disrespectful,  condescending and rude to him.  There was a mistake from the first part of the delivery, of COURSE we didn’t get our complete order after 7 weeks.  We even had to drive from Yorba Linda to Colton, ON A FRIDAY to pick up the piece they didn’t even order to complete the bed 🤦🏻‍♀️   We were missing one entire side of a bed frame.  We ordered a full size bunnies board and they sent a queen size.  Took another 2.5 weeks to get the correct size board along with the rest of the bedroom set.
DO. NOT. ORDER. FROM. ASHLEY. EVER.
YOU. HAVE. BEE. WARNED.</review>

We needed see real pieces of furniture for our new home. Sergio Martinez helped us out during our visit. He was able to help us get exactly what we wanted and ended up giving us a great deal. I felt great leaving the store knowing I got what I wanted and knowing that I saved a lot of money doing so. The pieces are beautiful and I can’t wait until I get them all.<//Text>

We made a few trips to Ashley’s before making our purchase. The first few trips, we have a really good experience. Unfortunately, the last trip (which is also the trip I made the purchase) ruined all my positive impression to Ashley’s. Sales rep promised a lot of discount at first, but on the day of our purchase, he pushed us to another rep, who doesn’t give us the same discount. We ended up spending $2,000 more. We feel like being fooled. The worst of all, the staff talked behind customer’s back. It seems like the staff were complaining us making too many trips before making the purchase, which made our experience at Ashley’s even worst.</Text>

<review>My experience might just be my experience but when I went there to look for a mattress the salesman that helped me was not very considerate. He did not offer me a sheet to use to sit on the mattreses. Covid prevention right? And when I had couldn't find the right mattress model he said "oh this is the one" it didn't match the skew number. Then when I found the correct one I saw in their add it was $600 more than was advertised. He said don't worry about it ill give it to you for that price. Sounds fishy to me. Now I don't trust the sales rep.and what he says. He seems to only care about making a sale and not care about what I need. Last thing, when I couldn't find exactly what I want he tells me "well, maybe this place isn't for you." I was thinking wow that was rude.

Purchased furniture and was promised 4-6 weeks delivery. Then was told they are facing delays so I waited patiently. Delivery ended up taking 11 weeks. At this point, I would've went somewhere else if I knew I was to wait 3 months which is ridiculous. Asked for compensation for the troubles and was told 3-6 weeks to process a store credit. I've waited 8+ weeks and still nothing. Long story short, they play with your money, they're going to nickel and dime you for everything, they don't give about customer service and meeting expectations. Anything over 3+ stars is questionable.< /Review>

<time>1608256047655<//time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>DO NOT BUY FROM ASHLEY FURNITURE...I purchased an Ashley 9 series adjustable base plus their 10yr GBS protection plan to feel rest assured I would be taken care of in case anything goes wrong I would be serviced. Totally not the case...After only 1yr of using it the motor went out. When I went back in to file a claim I kept getting the run around being told to call their customer service department that is outsourced to help. Not much help there after several days of trying to get a hold of them I spoke with someone who told me they couldn’t help me since they don’t have my record of purchase, no email to submit it and no product knowledge of Ashley products. Finally I went back in to the Ashley store to speak to the manager to speak to them to help submit a claim that they refused to help with did I get them to help file a claim to mail me the part I needed to repair my base but had to troubleshoot it myself with the help of the manager in-store. Long story short 2 months go by to get the parts I needed and technicians to come out to service it for it to only work for a day before the base went out again. Now the base is stuck with the neck up and has been 4 weeks and still can’t get them to service or replace it. I have to spend my days off going in and trying to get some sort of resolution but they keep dragging their feet.<//Review>< Pictures>

Mike was extremely professional and friendly (at Yorba Linda). This store didn't pressure me or overcharge me. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the Murrieta location</review>

<text>We went in looking for a twin over full bunk bed with trundle and they didn't offer one. Sher our sales guy was very helpful looking for what we needed. We were also looking for a sectional couch and found one that was very comfortable and fit our space. Paperwork and purchase was very easy and simple. I highly recommend talking to Sher when you visit Ashley Honestore!!<//text><time>1590764940293</time>< userid>

<time>1606260004120<//time><rate>1<//rate><Text>DOES NOT DESERVE ANY STARS! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! By far, the worst experience EVER. We ordered our furniture over 6 weeks ago... and still have not received our entire order. We were told we can check the furniture before we signed for it for THRESHOLD Delivery. When they came for first delivery they refused us the right to check it as we were told by SALES REP. They took the furniture (half of the original order) back, because we REFUSED to sign for something we were not able to confirm. We immediately went to the store (because you cannot get ahold of anyone when calling). The SALES rep said that she would take care of us and give us priority delivery and ALL of our furniture would be delivered. This was a lie. Two weeks later we were suppose to get our furniture, BUT they changed it on us and extended our delivery another WEEK. TODAY was suppose to be the day we received our order. Well, guess what, again they are missing pieces to our order. How do you put together a BED without the FOOTBOARD? Also, the other half of our couch was also not delivered (which was the reason they extended the delivery a week, but didnt even have it with this delivery). Called the store to ask what is going on.... well, again they will not do anything to fix their mistakes. We are now being told we have to wait for another delivery. Oh, and not to mention the SALES rep said we would get premium delivery and THAT WAS A LIE, we are still receiving THRESHOLD. They lie, dont correct their mistakes. I wanted to have my son a birthday gathering with family and I couldnt because they couldnt give us the couch and we waited and yet we still dont have the couch.! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.< /Text>< pictures>

I moved And did not have much time to plan, nor did I know Where to start... but WOW, what an experience!!... Angie, the amazing, sweet and very knowledgeable lady that helped me, along with Charles and Alex, her supervisors... were all truly amazing and Knew their product so well! They were able to help me find exactly what I needed, and helped me discover even more things, I would Not have thought of myself! I am So in love with all my new furniture and home decor items... and I’m so grateful to Angie and her managers for being so kind and patient in helping me find the very best quality and style in my price range... I feel like I found everything I needed In ONE magical place!

The Ashley Home Store in Yorba Linda was a fantastic one stop shop for our furniture needs. Our customer service rep, Nik, was a tremendous help, laying out our options for some of the furniture we were looking at. He was very helpful WITHOUT being pushy or overbearing. He pointed out various options and was very knowledgeable and friendly. We walked out of there in about an hour with all our needs met and feeling great about our purchases! If you need furniture go see Nik at Ashley Home Store in Yorba Linda on Savi Ranch Road!<//Review>

<Text>Do not order furniture from any Ashley Home Store.  The quality is really poor compared to what is in the showroom.  We purchased Bed, Buffet and Sofa.  Remote to the bed is not working which we purchased an extended warranty and no resolution or replacement to date.  Customer Service is terrible.  Spend you hard earned money elsewhere.< /Text><Rate>1< /Rate><date>1599774852108< /date>< userid>

Okay... I am late leaving this review, however,  I never disappoint. I just have to say that I got a temperpedic and ergo base with it. Also a sectional for my apartment from Ashley furniture in Yorba Linda. I am a very picky Italian shopper and I drove them crazy.  I am very pleased with my furniture and I got an awesome deal.  The sales team went out of their way to please me and bent over backwards to give me a great price for it.  So far I have had no problems and I hope that I don't.  I must say that the sales manager Alex is a class act.  Very professional and he followed everything through for me.  I love him to death.  Ben was a great sales guy and got me the best price and the original sales lady got the ball rolling along with Charles the manager.  I must say it was a great experience and I do recommend this store especially on promotional holiday times.  I was very skeptical at first but it turned out good and don't be afraid to ask for what you want.<//Text>

<Review>Stay as far away as you can from this store. Purchased furniture from this store and had multiple issues after delivery.  Our couch stopped working and they sent out a tech. The tech found the problem and ordered the parts and told me to install them.  Charles the manger is a joke.  If you have an issue they definitely will not help.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
TERRIBLE! Ordered something that was on back order, paid for it up front. Item was never delivered. Called to try to find out what happened and was told the order was cancelled by the store...but I was never refunded for the item I paid for! I never even received notice the order was cancelled. No call, no email, no refund. The call center “doesn’t have access to that information” so I was told to contact the store. But the store phone auto directs to the call center. So there is no way to actually talk to store other than apparently going in (during a pandemic). On top of this, furniture is TERRIBLE quality. The dining chairs started falling apart within a month and they were sat in maybe twice by small people. The assembly team left screws sticking out and didn’t secure everything. The couch is sagging and pilling after 8 months. I would NEVER shop here again and I’m planning to report fraudulent practice for cancelling my prepaid order without notice or refund.< /review>

I wish I could put zero stars for this company and location. I ordered on September 3rd and they said it would arrive on October 8th. On October 8th I checked the status and they had the wrong address because the sales rep made a mistake. I waited on hold for a long time to speak with the sales manager and they ended up fixing the address but now it won’t be delivered until October 25th. The customer service is terrible and they make you suffer for mistakes they made, don’t order from them unless you like being disappointed.< /Review>

<Review>Ashley HomeStore by far has the worst customer service especially Yorba Linda store.
I bought my sofa about 3 months ago but it was only 2 weeks ago they delivered.  This was delayed due to COVID which was understandable.   My delivery of the sofas was delayed about 3-4 times and every-time my delivery was delayed i only found out about it a day before and it was only when i called to find out if my delivery was on schedule.  I felt that the store only cared about the sale and not informing the customer that due to current situation the delivery may be delayed.  For the inconvenience when i called their customer service they issues me a $100 and a $50 gift card.
After my sofa were delivered i went to the store to buy a rug.  they did not have a good collection so asked if they can order from online.  The agent told me that for online stuff and to redeem gift card i have to order it from online or call customer service.  I called their 800 number to place the order and they said to redeem the gift card i had to go to store and they can order the online rug and redeem the gift card.  I went to store again but this time i got another story.
Ali Minaei, the manager told me that they can order the online rug from store but i have to pay the full price and not the sale price.  So $150 rug on sale i have to pay the $275 in order to redeem the $150 gift card.  So i said that is load of BS.  He said that the online or the corporate stores are different than the local store.  The local manager can decide the rules on redeeming the gift cards.  After back n forth i decided to buy something from the store.  Now he comes back and says that i can not redeem the $100 and $50 gift card on the same transaction.  I have to buy 2 different item and have 2 different transaction and redeem $50 gift card on one and $100 gift card on the other.  So the manager was making up the rules as he was loosing the argument.
The only statement on the git card was 'The Gift card is good for a one-time purchase and is not redeemable for cash. Non-transferrable'.  I had purchased from this store before but the service was not that bad but seems like the new inventory of management and its employees cares only about bottom line and not customer service.  I would never buy anything from Ashleys every agin and would recommend anyone from staying away.</Review>< Resp>

<review>Ordered a new bedroom set that was 3 weeks late to arrive. Ended up being broken anyway so it took an additional couple of weeks to return and receive a new set. Very frustrating experience to say the least. Vowed to never shop here again but the store store attempted to compensate my misfortune by providing $550 in merchandise cards. Great! So I thought...

I decided to give them one last chance to redeem themselves. I went in a few months later to order a new twin mattress that was $162 online and a mattress protector for $80. When the employee asked how I would like to pay, I broke out the merchandise cards. He said, “let me get my manager”. Here’s where it gets great.

Manager(Alex) comes over and explains that the cards only apply to the full retail price of the item...in this case, the $162 mattress was $500 retail. What!? Smoke a mirrors.

Save your time, go to another furniture store that actually carries their products in store. For me Ashley is down the street, but the convenience isn’t worth the time. I will literally drive out of my way to avoid giving them any of my business.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>I DO NOT recommend this store. purchsed bed sets, Sofa and love seat. Sofa and love seat is just ok. It looks modern and fabric seems durable, but I found chunky staples falling out from the bottom. My dog could chew it.
Bed sets are terrible. when I was shopping at store, I asked to sales person whether bed set frames are solid wood or not and he said it is solid PINE wood. But it is Not!!!!! It is manufactured wood with vaneer. I noticed that dresser was also damaged so I requested exchange and It tooks over one month... After a month they brought new one and it is also defecive... Flat board at the bottom is not stapled.. so I have to wait another technician will come my house.. What a terrible quality, terrible service. I won't buy anything from Ashley furniture ever!!!!

I can't complain about  the customer service in this store by the shopping time, customer service deparment 1800#, the drivers are excelent very polite, profesionals and concerned about the property, furniture, ect ....  our sales man Mac was very nice courteous and pleasant and made the sale!!....  can't  give them a better  review because my order wasn't  complete properly and i got a delivery of the wrong item, not once but twice !!... i understood the first time, as could  be a 2 sides mistake/responsability - mine because didnt doble check and him because put the wrong color in my order-invoice and rest of paperwork .. some people involved  in the transactions return  and all the process didnt take responsability of their actions which made.me.feel.very uncomfortable, they ended sending me a sleepersofa many days after promissed,  it was suppose to be "a deal",  I think it was the item in the showroom, and i ended buying it to have something!! But it still wasnt what I initially wanted to buy .. furniture looks very nice for the price,  cant say anything about real quality yet!.. prices are very good.. they have nice settings in the show room, many offers, deals and options, I may go back to give them a 2nd  chance, but ready to doble check the sale, negociate if needed, clarify terms, delivery, exceptions, fees, return policy, cancelation etc..</review>

I bought a bedroom set. They delivered the intable one was broken
They had too resend it
They didn’t   deliver  the dresser and they told me it will be delivered in a month the week came I called them no call back called two other times no call back
They finally answered and said my dresser isn’t in stock it will be 3 more months
They are selling things that they don’t even have
They have no communication skills don’t waste your time

Our sales representative was very helpful. I loved our the sales associates didn’t awkwardly follow behind us as we were shopping. They let us come to them with any questions we had. This put myself and my mom at ease and we ended up buying a living room and bedroom set. I will definitely be going back to Ashley’s in the future!<//review>

Rick Flynn is a dishonest sales man. do not get duped into paying "threshold delivery" when it is advertise for free delivery. Also he said half off if we paid debit or cash. but online it was already half off regardless of type of payment. he added $200 worth of extra charges and explained it as a discounted price for making an appointment. avoid this salesman at all cost  !< /text>

<Text>I purchased furniture about a month ago from Mike at the Savi Ranch location of Ashley's Furniture and I had an incident with my Sofa when my 4 year old son wrote a smiley face with a permanent marker on it. "sigh" THANK GOD MIKE offered me the GBS protection plan because they were able to come out and take care of it for me without me having to worry about any of it.. Thank you Mike for really helping me out on that. Even though i didn't want it to begin with..

<rating>1< /rating><text>THIEVES , I had a bedframe delivered on June 14th to men came to set up bed , I had just taken my apple watch off and put it on my husbands dresser because I was cooking well they were setting up the bed. When they left I gave them a big tip went into my bedroom to charge my watch and it was missing . So next day went back to savi ranch store and I told them what happen they gave me a number to call to put in claim, I asked to see manager he would not come and see me. Put a claim in with Kawana B and they responded if I didn't have cameras in my bedroom to bad basically. So I started another claim with Paulette and have not heard back. so I called Savi Ranch store again begging to speak to manager he refuse to talk to me said Katrina. So I called back again and spoke to Tracey and she said manger told her to tell me to call customer service I told her I did 10 times and I want to speak to the manager I said give me his name she laughed and said it was Charles and told me have a nice day and hung up on me. DON'T TRUST ASHLEY FURNITURE THEY HAVE PEOPLE THAT STEAL FROM YOUR HOME . WHY DO THEY HAVE A MANAGER THAT WON'T HELP PEOPLE.< /text>< pics>

I was asked to put my initials in a blank paper , it was sketchy, that too in a place like yorba Linda. I had to 30 minutes to pay for a placer for my dining table , since it was not high ticket item nobody cared , oh and the dining table I am getting delivery after 2 months . Hopefully I’ll get it this time .  Going in there Is worst then going to a car dealership.<//review>

Thanks to Jerry for his patient assistance during the 2 hours I spent sitting on every sofa in the store. I never felt pressured, but he was always available to answer questions and rearrange furniture so I could get a visual. Thanks to his assistance, I was able to find exactly what I wanted.<//Review>

<Text>On March 14,  I purchased several pieces of furniture with Angel Gazleh of Ashley's Furniture in Yorba Linda and scheduled it for delivery on April 18, 2020 as I was moving to a new place on that date. All of the furniture that I ordered was delivered on time except for one piece of furniture and this furniture was rescheduled to arrive May 31. I was informed this was due to it being on backorder. However, it did not arrive on that date. I called to get status on this after several days and was told it was sitting in a warehouse after being on hold for several hours. I did not understand why I was not advised of this but nevertheless I scheduled a delivery date with the representative on the phone for a new delivery date of June 6.

I received a call before June 6 and was advised that the item was now on backorder and won't be available until the 16th of June and it was set to be delivered between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. After expressing my frustration with this constant rescheduling and hours wasted on hold I was offered a $50 gift card due to the inconvenience and I was promised a return call from the manager. However, I neither received a phone call nor the gift card.

I chose to work from home on the date of the delivery as Ashley's requires that you remain available. The day came and I again received NO DELIVERY. After checking status I saw that the delivery was "unable to be completed" and when I tried to call the driver I received no response only a Voicemail that was in spanish. I tried several times to reach him to no avail. I was then forced to called Ashley's Yorba Linda's store customer service 3 times  (twice the phone call was dropped or no one picked up) and was on hold for SEVERAL HOURS to which I was told that they were having furniture delivery issues due to COVID-19 which could not be accurate as I received prior shipments with no issue. Then, I was advised that the driver attempted to call me at 8:15 a.m (15 minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time), however I did not receive this call. Regardless, I do not understand why a driver would need to call and not bother to reach me via text OR at the very least knock on my door to at least ATTEMPT delivery. Neither of this occurred and I received no explanation. I was placed on hold AGAIN for several minutes to which the representative, Diana, explained to me that the store will attempt to contact the driver, however they made a disclaimer that he may not even pick up the phone and he is already at his last stop of the day. At this point, I have very little hope that I will EVER receive this item of furniture despite the fact that I have already paid for it. This customer service was a complete NIGHTMARE and I will never do business with this establishment again.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dcd1d9a6a96985:0x492f093bc7603369<//GmapID>< response>

This place is an absolute joke!! Horrible customer service!!! I went and bought 2 mattresses from them, I only received one. Still waiting on the other one It’s been a month already. Every time I call either no answer or I’m told I will get a call back in 5 to 10 minutes. A couple days later still no call. When I finally do speak to someone they are very unprofessional and cannot answer any of my questions and are back to telling me they will call me back with answers ( no call back). This is the first and last time I get anything from this store. Save your money and go somewhere else.< /review>

Me and my wife probably spent about 3 hours in the store with Mike he was so helpful. we shopped for a new home and had a great experience. He offered the best prices in the market. He wasn't pushy at all and allowed us to wonder on our own as well. Best experience i've had at any ashley furniture store so far. Alex the Sales manager was also very helpful</review>

<resp>None< /resp><Rate>5< /Rate><review>I had the best experience with Gerry from start to finish. He provided the most personal excellent customer service. It took several trips to the showroom and text messages to Gerry with more questions than I would like to admit before I made my purchase. Gerry never made me feel rushed or pressured to make any purchase. He was always available to answer questions or meet with me to show me whatever I needed. When something wasn’t exactly priced how I wanted or the payment plan wasn’t structured how I wanted he made sure to get it done. Thanks again for everything Gerry. Make sure you ask for him for your purchasing needs.< /review><Date>1574703876200</Date>< gmap_id>

Customer service is a joke at this store, I purchased few items at this store and they were delivered 1.5 month ago, there was a damage on my bed headboard and missed an item.  I called right away and let the sales person know, and he said someone is going to call me, 1.5 month later and after few follow ups still no one called. I also bought 2 night stand drawers for the price of one ( as was told by the store manager because I spent over $5000 he offered me this deal) and only received one. and now they tell me I only bought one. The very nice sale manger at this store accused me of lying when I told him the story by saying I realized that one is not enough and that's why I am trying to get the second one for free by lying ( after spending $5000 I would lie for $200 item!!). Thanks for your professionalism gentlemen!< /text>

Our experience at Ashley Anaheim Hills was fantastic! The manager was so personable and friendly and made sure our experience was top notch. Our salesperson Shar was excellent! He really listened to what we wanted and was not pushy and he went the extra mile to make sure we had a great experience. Would highly recommend shopping at Ashley of ANAHEIM Hills!<//text>

<text>Keishan Moseley helped me with choosing the sofa and carpet, he is soooo helpful and very professional. After he asked what kinda sofa I am looking for, he gave me several good suggestions on the ones i may like. I end up choosing the one he suggests for me. I'm really satisfied and happy with my experience shopping with Keishan. Thank you for your kindness, I would definitely find you again when i need another piece of furniture.

Thank you<//text>< GmapID>

<Review>Terrible customer service after they only delivered the sectional part of our couch and then said the earliest they can deliver the rest is in one week.

We had also bought a TempurPedic bed as well so we did spend around $5,000 for terrible customer service.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP06miwSDsgSJp-ZLkbJB6VP0QWaGo5bOVIyBeh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>First off Mohammad kayyali was an amazing sales associate. He was very friendly and didn’t treat my boyfriend and I any different then anyone else. Usually people look at us because we are young, 21 and 23 and think we’re not serious buyers but that wasn’t the case with him and I really appreciated that. He also informed us with all the deals they had to offer and didn’t try to offer us the most expensive items first. He knew we were looking for reasonable priced furniture and he went out of his way to just show us those items which was amazing. I was able to get all the furniture or my dreams for a very reasonable price with very low monthly payments. So far I am very satisfied. As of now we are just waiting for the arrival of our furniture which will be Tuesday feb 4th. Super excited and can’t wait until it is here. Thank you Ashley’s furniture and most of all thank you Mohammad for all your help and being so kind.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

My sales person was Dorothy and she the best sale person. Shopping for furniture is my least favorite thing but she made it a great experience shopping at this store. I have more rooms in my house that I need to fill and I will be coming back to this store and will let all of my family know how great she is</Review>

<text>I am so impressed the the Customer Service at Ashley Furniture in Savi Ranch.
Rich Odom was fabulous and patient in helping me choose my new couch and console for my 108 year old cottage!  And the manager of the store was amazing, as well.  Everyone made my experience the best and they even let me redecorate my favorite sofa right there in the store!  Their pillow selection is fabulous, as well... I cannot wait for my QUICK DELIVERY
this Sunday!
Kindest regards!

First I want to say....I will NEVER shop at Ashley Furniture ever again.
We will also be telling our friends and family to NOT SHOP HERE!
HORRIBLE STORE MANAGEMENT!!!! FULL OF LIARS!!!!!
We bought our furniture at the Yorba Linda location. They told us to pick it up on the coming Monday, Which we did. But when we got there...They told us we could only receive the display model because they don't any available stock for this SKU (Would not have paid full price if we knew it would be a floor model)
I argued with their manager Ray, he said will give a little be a discount on the display because they won't have it in stock anymore, and would give us $200 store credit.
(BTW The discount is a joke!! and when we got home we were still missing a screw!)

Since we had $200 store credit to use, we went back to the store to redeem it.
(We feel everything in that store is OVERPRICED, and only wanted to use exactly $200 and nothing more!!!)

On 2/24 we went into the Yorba Linda location and asked for "Ray" to use our $200 store credit. I could see on his face that he couldn’t believe we were coming back to use the store credit, because we only purchased exactly $200 worth of goods.
(Trust me it was hard because EVERYTHING in the store is OVERPRICED)
We ordered it in store  but wouldn’t let us take it home, said it would need to be delivered to us, and gave us a delivery date of 3/2 (which it never did)
I called back on 3/7 AGAIN and they said it will be shipped today and will call me back to provide a tracking number.
They never called me back, I had to call in again on 3/9 to finally receive tracking information.

We finally received the package on 3/11 and GUESS WHAT?
OF COURSE the freaking table is BROKEN!!!!

I called the store, but no one picked up. I message Ray but no response. I called Ashley furniture customer service they said we had to contact the store directly, or they could send a technician.  fine! Send a technician, I’m sure He won’t be able to repair it. it is a marble table top stone.
STILL NO RESULT AT ALL.
SERIOUSLY THE WORSE STORE EVER!< /Text>

My wife and I went into the Ashley Furniture Store in Yorba Linda to look at a couch. I’ll advice you to check the prices online before walking in. I didn’t do this so the deal I thought I got, was not a deal at all. Not a good first and last experience with Ashley Furniture.< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience at Ashley furniture. I purchased one of their living room sets that included 14 most wonderful things for my home. Stephanie was wonderful. She was helpful and knowledgeable about the furniture. She also helped me to see the many different options that I could include in my set. She did this without being pushy and was very understanding about me not being g able to make decisions so I brought my daughter in to help. I would recommend Ashley as far as the purchase goes. Will let you know once I get my furniture how I like it.< /text>

I came in last Sunday and Purchased a swivel glider chair and received help from Mike, he was very nice and let me browse around for a while. I highly recommend asking for Mike when you visit Ashley’s in Yorba Linda< /Text>

From the minute I walked in the sales man  Mohammed greeted us with a great deal! I have been looking for furniture for about a week and was not having any luck. I went to about 15 other furniture stores and Mohammad  immediately told me that Ashley furniture was having a huge sale with 50% off everything in the store on that day. I was so excited and knew I had to find something! I explained to Mohammed exactly what I was looking for and he found my perfect sectional couch within a few minutes! It was perfect! Not only did they have that furniture in stock but they were able to have it delivered within the week and I could arrange the pieces the way that I liked it to be.  All the other furniture stores had sectional but they could not change the style to the way that I wanted and if I wanted to have it custom shaped then it would take at least 6 weeks. Don't believe the advertisements that you hear on the television when they tell you you can walk out with your furniture even if it's custom made. Ashley furniture in Yorba Linda made it happen immediately and right away! The manager was super nice and gave me a great deal on the mattress that I purchased along with an adjustable base and threw in extra incentives! I should have started at Ashley furniture from the be getting at not gone anywhere else! I've had Ashley furniture in the past and it lasted me over 10 years! Definitely never going anywhere else ever again! Thank you so much Ashley furniture in Yorba Linda for a great experience furniture shopping and for making it so easy and exactly what I was looking for!<//text>

<Review>Great Service and patience with me. Found a really nice sofa on sale. I opted for 5 year protection and delivery. They delivered my sofa early and were very courteous and professional. Love the sofa. Perfect size and comfortable. Highly recommend Ashley.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcd1d9a6a96985:0x492f093bc7603369</Gmap_id></record>

<name>Jason Little<//name><Review>Absolutely incompetent, fraudulent, and dishonest. These are just a few words that come to mind that describe the last 4 years that I've been dealing with this store.

I purchased an overpriced $3K piece of garbage mattress made by Stearns and Foster in January 2016. It took me 3.5 years of regular phone calls and their multiple visits to my house for inspections to get them to finally admit the matress was defective and I was owed a refund. It took them 4 months to give me a partial refund of $2.4K. I am still missing $600 and am at my wit's end with the sheer incompetence of this store. I am embarrassed that I let myself get taken advantage of like this and do not want to fight with them anymore. I should have walked next door to Costco where the prices, furniture, and customer service are outstanding but instead I was lured in by the attractive financing and friendly sales people.

Do not shop here under any circumstance. You will regret it when a problem comes up and no member of their "management" will talk to you. While there are many other shocking aspects of my dealings with them, I am simply too exhausted to write them all down and I hope this review is an adequate enough warning to any of their potential customers. Go to Costco, or even IKEA, but please do not shop here.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Abdul Aziz Popal</user_name><time>1551146700365< /time><rate>5<//rate><Text>I recently visited this store for a piece of furniture that I needed. I was just skeptical about whether or not I would find someone at this store to take his time and bear with me while I explain to him my detailed expectation. So, here I was with this guy name Sher Ahmad who I found to be a very careful listener and a very respectful person while having a constant smile on his face. Not only that, I was amazed by the level of knowledge he possessed about the details of every piece of furniture that was available at the store and online. I also found him to be a business savvy and skilled salesperson, as he kept me at the store long enough by trying to sell package deals while offering ways to save money as well. In a nut shell, he helped me get what I wanted, and that was a win-win situation for both of us. I will try to contact him for my next furniture need and I highly recommend my friends and viewers to take their shopping needs at this store and to this welcoming person.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Horrible customer service. Salesperson was so rude when we asked why the price he rang us up for was more than advertised. We had simply asked for an explanation, and he instantly became angry. We were shocked at his behavior especially since we still ended up purchasing our bed from him. I will never recommend this store, Ashley Furniture In Savi ranch to anyone we know.</Text>< Pics>

<review>The store is beautifully arranged and the people working there are great!!  Austin took great care of us and really took the time to understand our needs with style, function, and budget in mind. You can tell their people take great pride in what they’re doing.  Customer service and a good variety of products made for a great shopping experience. If you couldn’t tell yet, I’d highly recommend coming to this store and walking out with a great deal!!<//review><date>1521845164356</date>< Pics>

<text>Do your research before going to this store, otherwise you will be robbed blind. I do not know how this store gets the good ratings😳my experience certainly does not reflect that. I searched online and printed out some models I like, but when I get to the store, 3 of five were not on display, one power recliner was not functioning. The price on the two floor models were 250% higher than the web price. So even you take the 35% off posted on the front door, you still got robbed. This sales practice is despicable.< /text><response>None</response><name>Sean Shih< /name>< userid>

We have recently moved to our brand new house and where super excited to buy furniture but had no idea what to get or the theme of our home. Holly the sales rep was very welcoming and really friendly she was able to help us chose our dinning room table set & living room sets. Now every time we host an event at our home everyone loves our furniture!! Will definitely be going back to her.. patio furniture next!<//Review>

< Review>
Buyer beware, DO NOT SHOP OR BUY FROM ASHLEY FURNITURE. My wife and I recently bought a bed from Ashley furniture.  It's an adjustable bed that operates poorly, and the mattress is not at all what we expected nor similar to the showroom. We have been waiting to make sure the bed was "broken in" per the salesperson. They advertise full money-back guarantee, however, once you sign for the delivery, it's yours forever no matter what, whether it works or not. We also bought a warranty, and it does not matter. We regret buying from Ashley furniture, they lied to us and now we are stuck with a bed we paid a lot of money for that is not as advertised.</Review>

Did not show me anything on floor similar to the couch i wanted online and honestly almost lost a sale but i was not gonna miss a good price for any salesman.

It would have been great...but the lady called me a "dung beetle" in spanish (mayate) as soon as I came in. That is so racist and rude. I'm very aware of other cultures and what they can say to degrade those with darker skin. I have affluent family; famous cousins and I'm telling them to never shop here.<//text>

I had a great experience at the Yorba Linda Ashley location. The sales associate, Steve, greeted me as I walked through the entrance, and helped me look at mattresses. In that regard, he was knowledgeable, not pushy, and helped direct me to a mattress that suited both my budget and needs. Then, when it came time to pricing, Ashley gave me a price that was more than fair. I will gladly come back to this location for my future furniture needs. 5 solid stars.</Text>

<Text>Horrible experience ever at the Yorba Linda Store!!! First, I brought a Cal King mattress, they delivered the regular mattress, I feel like they try to get away with that because it took me a couple hours for them to approved my correct mattress!!...I was in trouble at work because I showed up so late trying to resolve this issue!!!so finally they rescheduled the correct one that night.
Also, The salesperson name Mohammed was super liar and scam, he offered a mattress protector according to him in “special just for me” he said that the regular price was $200.00 dlrs and he can have it to me for $139.00.....IT WAS A SCAM!!! The mattress protector was for 139.00 regular price!! I called the store trying to speak with the store manager but the customer service Tracy never transfers me to the manager!!....so, they never help me!!
I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN AT ASHLEY STORES!!!</Text></record>

For the last few years, I have been going to purchase company desks and office furniture from Ashley Yorba Linda. On site, I noticed that they didn’t have everything on display, but quickly was given some great shipping options that helped me get what I was looking for. I will be going back. Ask for Sher.<//Review>

We went in the store to buy 6 dining chairs and ended up with 8 chairs, an office chair and 3 different items for our bare walls. A very nice gentleman named Sher helped us out. He was very helpful. He knew their stock well; offered without pressure other items to buy; and gave us a very fair price on our purchases. I will go back (not on Monday or Tuesdays cuz he doesn't work those days ;-) ) to do business with Sher again and this Ashley store.< /review>

We went to the Yorba Linda location tonight and had the most amazing experience. We were immediately greeted by Sher, we told him what we were looking for and he took us through the store and helped us find exactly what we wanted.  He was so helpful and was not a typical salesman. We never felt like he was pressuring us and made us feel like we were the only people in the showroom. We can't wait to go back and have him help us with our next purchase.</text>

DO NOT SHOP HERE. Horrible furniture store! Merchandise is over priced and when my wife and I went to purchase a bed here we only had planned on spending around $1000 on a mattress. The salesperson had us try a $4000 mattress and it was very comfortable. I realized this was a floor model and had already "broken in" so when I asked he told me it would only take a few weeks to a month. It is now 4 months later, and our bed is still not broken in. I work construction and my wife has back problems, and now we are stuck with this overpriced POS. Oh and by the way after looking around elsewhere I have seen the price for exactly what we purchased at around $2500. DO NOT EVER SHOP AT ASHLEY. Unless you like wasting your money. I really hope that somebody at corporate reads this. I work really hard for my money and YOU ARE A BUNCH OF THIEVES.</text>

We were out looking for couches and stopped in to about three or four different furniture stores.   When we came to Ashley's wife found Veronica . Veronica was great she helped us find the perfect couches.  Ashley's had the best selection and the best prices of all the stores that we visited as well as the best sales person Veronica<//text>

<review>Always great deals, long-lasting, durable, attractive furniture.  No longer contracted with Guardsman for warranty services, a major plus.  Delivery prices are $$$, based on your total purchase price.  Sales people are pretty typical of those with commission-based salaries, so I can't say whether our guy was genuinely "nice".  I would come back, as we have been for the past 10 years.< /review>< Pictures>

Steve did a fantastic job of helping us out last night right from Square One. Equipped with a measuring tape he came right over and was able to sort through their wide selection based off of the description that we gave him. Steve was very informative about the products, but he also knew when to give my fiance and me space to discuss things. He left us alone to discuss but was available throughout our entire 2 hour visit but was always available/nearby. He was very patient and didn't steamroll us with a sales pitch. Was actually extremely pleased with my visit overall.<//text>

Walked into the store today and we were  pleasantly greeted by Sergio.  He was very informative about the bed and mattress we were looking at, gave me a good price and made the sell. Sergio was a pleasure to do business with and I will be back. Great salesman!< /review>

<Review>Our sales representative, Stephanie, was well versed in design from functionality, color palette, fabric texture and, implementation. My wife and I were very impressed with how she assisted us in developing a cohesive solution with expertise and simplicity. Though the Yorba Linda showroom was large and overwhelming at first, it soon became easily navigated thanks to her guidance. Her positive attitude and willingness made for a pleasurable shopping experience. We initially arrived ill prepared but Stephanie educated us to better direct our focus. She suggested a few solutions and critical items to consider when returning to our living space before deciding on purchasing any pieces. After a couple weeks of contemplating furniture type, layout and size; we confidently purchased a beautiful large sectional sofa. Stephanie did an amazing job with helping us make that final selection and thoroughly explained our purchase options and delivery logistics. Although this was our first experience and purchase with Ashley’s furniture, we look forward to our next shopping adventure with special thanks to Stephanie!<//Review><user_id>107510041923247665645</user_id><username>Robert Verdugo</username>< Rating>

Richard was extremely patient and helpful throughout our furniture purchasing process. My wife and I have had bad experiences in the past with over bearing sales associates, but Richard gave us plenty of space and time to come to our own decision on the livingroom pieces we eventually purchased. We are super happy with our choices and will definitely come back to Ashley’s for our future furniture needs. I also wanted to give a shout out to Austin Chow the store manager who gave us candid advice which totally helped with our purchasing decision. We never felt up sold and we felt totally comfortable with Austin and Richard’s input.< /text>

Absolutely loved my experience at Ashley's in Yorba Linda. The staff was courteous and helpful from the moment I walked in. I already knew what I wanted and what the price was so I appreciated that they walked me through the paperwork and were able to get me out of there quickly and efficiently. I will definitely be back to buy my next furniture piece!< /Text>

We bought a TempurPedic mattress and a couch. We paid for delivery for all items.

We received only 2 pieces of our set. The remaining 2 pieces were at a warehouse... and were told we had to pick them up ourselves! We called the store in Anaheim
Hills 3 times, and were told 3 times they would call us back, and never did!

Terrible customer service in attempts to make this right.</Text>

**SEE YELP FOR TRUE AND HONEST REVIEWS**
Such a horrible company to do business with. I would not recommend my worst enemy to set foot within a mile of any Ashley’s stores.
All of the 5 star ad’s on this page are probably paid for or forged, and the 1 star reviews are actual upset customers. Long story short, we got sold a defective product and they did everything they could to try and brush us off. We fought tooth and nail, attempted to contact an impossible to reach customer service, and went in store numerous times. We went in one time requesting a refund or a replacement, and they had the balls to try to upsell us to something that was thousands of dollars more. After going through our bank to file a claim, ashleys finally caved in and got us a replacement after 4 months of them trying to brush us off.

I had a great experience at Ashley home store last week when I went there.  I had to buy some living room furniture and there was one guy named Maaz who was helping me out. He was so patient with such good sales-man attitude, smiling, friendly such a gentle person he is. He was not rushing, showing me all the stuff that I was asking for and giving me complete details about whatever I was looking at. And I got a good deal too ;) thanks a lot.  Hope to see him again at the store on my next visit for my bedroom stuff.<//Text>

Went in last week not looking for anything in particular. We were greeted by Maaz, who was very responsive and knowledgeable about their latest offerings. He was able to navigate our indecisiveness and helped us in narrowing down to two different bedroom sets that we are now thinking over. We will be going back soon to get one of the two he helped us finalize. Very good experience in coming out with something tangible when we went in just looking to browse<//Text>

I had a great experience at Ashley. Sher Ahmadyar was incredibly helpful and informative. I went in unsure about what I wanted and he patiently walked me through my options and provided great advice and information. He even convinced me to get items I didn’t know I wanted or needed :) I’ll be back!< /Review>

<Time>1514524301958< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Possibly the best furniture store out there in terms of price, customer service and quality without the astronomical prices of Pottery Barn or Restoration Hardware. Most of my living room and bedroom pieces are Ashley Furniture and I'm proud to say that. Austin (sales manager) and his team are the best in the business. They are honest, offer fair assessments of all their products and won't try to upsell you on something you don't need. To boot, the prices of their products are fair and their customer service and delivery times are efficient. I'm fully confident that if I can get a great deal at Ashley that the general public can too. Ask for Austin or one of his top associates and make sure to ask for the best deal. :)</Review>< Pictures>

Not a good place to purchase a mattress. Most reputable furniture stores give you a 90 or 100 day comfort guarantee like sears sit and sleep Mathis brothers Ashley Furniture gives you nothing. They even make you sign a sales final before you even receive the mattress. I give Ashley a thumbs down 👎🏻</review>

Maaz was great. He was really helpful in helping me find the sofa sleeper I was looking for. He was really patient and answered all my questions perfectly even as we went all over the store to look for the best one. He was very knowledgeable and explained everything perfectly. He deserves an award for his excellent customer service.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>The customer service from Mohammad was so pleasant & easy. It was nice to be able to go in and have the team research and find a couch set from the past few months that I wanted.  Their 14 piece starting at $999 was an increditable deal and was able to pick the styles I wanted to go with the couch. The Ashley's Yorba Linda location is definitely worth the time to stop by and see what they can do for anyone looking for home furnishing.  Overall very comforting, easy and pleasant to deal with.< /text>< Pictures>

It was so pleasant and the knowledge that our salesperson Stephanie has was much appreciated. I like that we could take our time to decide on what we wanted without people constantly following us around.  Stephanie was great and the manger on site that evening was also very helpful.  (Sorry I forgot his name). I will definitely make ashleys my #1 place to shop for furniture needs.</Review>

After being referred here by my fiance's parents I had a great experience.  Sher came highly recommended as well and made my first furniture shopping experience truly pleasant.  He answered all of our questions and guided us through the entire process. We ended up buying a sectional, ottoman, dining table and bedroom set in one visit thanks to Sher's assistance!< /review>

<Date>1497035238850<//Date><text>Ashley's is a great place  to buy quality furniture. Huge selection and very helpful staff. However the pricing can be a little high and the sales people all have a knack for making each additional item sound no only reasonable but essential. No high pressure sales tactics or anything like that, just logical and true reasons why adding the additional recliner would be a smart thing to do.  I would make sure that you head to Ashley's when they have one of their big sales events and plan on spending some time there. It's very comfortable and quite to give you a chance to find what you are looking for at a price you can afford. All in all a good experience both in store and with delivery.< /text><user_name>Robert Lopez< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

First of all, what a beautiful store! It is so hard to make a decision when everything is so well presented! The sales rep was friendly and informative and they did not hover so I appreciate that. The whole process was a breeze. I am definitely sending my friends and fam to buy from this store!< /review>

Find Sher at this store! I bought several products there and there was an undesirable happening. I can’t explain what it happened but one thing I want to tell is that he’s a very responsible person. He was ready to help his customer from the heart and he was very responsible for what he sold. I just move here from other country few weeks ago so my English is limited. He even took care of this situation and helped me a lot. I’m gonna buy more there because of him. To be honest, I was not really comfortable with customer service but he was different from them.<//review>

Im so happy with my visit to Ashley's and thanks to the salesman who handled me and his manager making me feel important enough to walk out of the store happy, I will absolutely be a lifelong returning customer. When I move out of my condo and into a house in my hopefully near future, I will definitely be furnishing my home fully through Ashley's. Thank you guys, if you are reading this. Your assistance with my purchase was painless and absolutely worthwhile.</Review>

My husband and I went in looking for a specific couch. We had already been to a couple different stores and knew exactly what we wanted. We were welcome and helped by J.D. He was friendly and professional. We told him what we were looking and he showed us a couple different options. He helped us find a couch that fit what me and my husband were both looking for! He also gave us a killer deal. We will definitely be back in the future and hope to have J.D.’s help again. Thank you J.D.! We are so excited for our new couches!!!!! :)< /review>

<Text>Jackie was amazing! She was extremely patient with us waiting for escrow to close on our new house and for my business trip to end. She kept in touch and was helpful on the multiple visits we made to play around with ideas of what to buy.< /Text>< Pictures>

If you like generic styles with overpriced sales good here.
Went here hoping they had a better selection then Jerome's. They did not, everything is the same style. Nothing modern or trendy, just that big pillowy huge couch design.

Don't waste your time coming here.<//text>

Jackie was very helpful and patient with my many changes.
Very anxious to have our order delivered.
Very satisfied with Jackie's pleasant manner and never felt any pressure.
When we have any other needs we will direct them to her.
Thank you.

I couldn't be more satisfied with my furniture shopping experience. The salesman, Mehrdad, was friendly, helpful, and informative without being pushy. When my husband and I were unsure of our decision, he politely excused himself to give us time to talk to each other privately.  I can't wait for our furniture to arrive this week.< /Text>

<text>Recently visited the store and found it to be overwhelming as this was the first time I was shopping for furniture, so I really didn't know what I was looking for.

Forturnetly, I was helped by Jackie, she was very insightful in helping me find something that fit my style and budget. She was knowledgeable of how different furniture compares to another. She didn't apply a lot of pressure for me to buy, which felt great! I was able to make a decision based on what I was thinking would be best for me! I plan on coming back in after the New Year and making my selection!<//text>< Response>

Wonderful experience!
I went to Ashley Yorba Linda and Mr. Sher Ahmad Ahmadyar helped me. Mr. Ahmadyar’s professionalism, politeness, responsiveness and kindness is unforgettable. I strongly recommend Ashley for your furniture needs and if your are close to the above mentioned location contact Mr. Ahmadyar. I am sure you won’t regret.< /Review>

I went in looking for a mattress and was helped by Veronica and Austin. They got me a great deal on my 14” Ashley’s Mattress with the cooling gel in it. Couldn’t have asked for better customer service, they were exceptionally kind and helped me get the bed I believe was perfect for me!</review>

<Text>Richard was very patient and accommodating the whole time my husband and I were shopping for a couch. I’ve been to Ashley’s furniture at a different location in the past and most of the time the salesmen are extremely pushy to the point of uncomfortable. Richard gave us plenty of space but was still within sight if we had any questions. He even pushed an accent chair from across the room so we could see him if it matched the couch we wanted to purchase. Talk about great service! Thank you so much Richard! We will definitely be recommending the Ashley’s furniture in YL to everyone!< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcd1d9a6a96985:0x492f093bc7603369< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Manager Ruben and Salesman Omid are unprofessional and rude at the Yorba Linda store. Check online pricing  if you are going to buy you will save lots of $$. Check yelp and BBB and Rip-off reports before you give them your business. I personally would shop elsewhere or at another Ashley’s if you really like a piece.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Went here to get a table and I ended up buying a mattress too with a very affordable price. Very friendly environment and the person that helped me was sher. Ask for him when you ever happen to visit. You will not be disappointed at this place.

This was a wonderful experience! Maaz is definitely the guy to go to! He gave us the BEST price for the couch of our dreams. He wasn’t too “sales-ie” and gave us room to keep looking while also giving us options. Thank you Maaz! Great salesman and great employee!<//text>

<Text>I just moved out on my own for the first time ever. I knew furniture shopping would be time consuming and there would be so many places to go. A co worker of mine mentioned Ashley but did say it was a bit expensive. Thankfully they had their 4th of July sale! As soon as I walked in Veronica greeted me and asked what I was looking for. I basically said everything. I looked around and fell in love with a bed there. I hadn't gotten the keys to my place yet so I needed to measure. She gave me prices went over some deals and told me not to rush. She said to get my measurements and come back. She was amazing and wasn't pushy at all. I got her card and told her I'd be back. Went in 2 days later and she gave me a great deal on what I needed!!! She even helped me with obtaining instructions on a previous Ashley bed I purchased, because we didn't know how to take it apart. I never felt like I was being forced to buy anything. She made the process so easy and was so sweet! Great experience and great customer service!!!!!!< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd1d9a6a96985:0x492f093bc7603369<//gmapID>< user>

When we visited the store we had very specific requirements on what we needed and wanted. James helped us so much on finding the furniture we wanted.
He walked around the whole store showing us what our options were .It took Us about 2 hours to make our decision , during this whole time he was very kind , patient and willing to help us find what we looked for. We left the store very happy , knowing that we ( my husband and I ) had taken care of our different prioriti s (good price, Comfort , elegance, quality ,storage accommodation ).
We got excellent discount 30% off ..</Review>

<username>Brandon Covington</username><pics>None< /pics><review>Last month my wife and I went into Ashley Furniture to look at buying a new couch.  Once inside, we were met with an overwhelmingly positive staff, specifically a lovely woman named Ines, who could not have been more helpful.  We weren't ready to buy on that day, as our wedding was coming up and we wanted to get past it before making any new purchases.  Ines was very understanding, and waited til after we were back from our honeymoon for us to return.  We went back last night and ended up leaving with a new bed, coffee table, and side table.  Everything was discounted, the customer service was 5 star, and we couldn't be happier with the experience.  If you need new furniture, do yourself a favor and go here, it's worth it.</review>< rate>

Just purchased a brand new amazing mattress from Ashley furniture store after much debate. I purchased a mattress and couch from Ashley 8-9 years back and went back since i had good customer service and a great deal with long term financing at 0% interest with their company card. The service I received today was absolutely phenomenal! Stephanie Elias was one of if not the best sales woman I have ever had the pleasure to do business with. She was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about everything we were looking for and she was not pushy or over selling. She was a true light in helping me and my fiancé decide on a new mattress that was perfect for us and we got an amazing deal! Ashley furniture is a great store but her service made this experience beyond noteworthy!<//text>

<Text>Last week I ordered a coffee table and end tables. When the items were delivered on that Friday one of the end tables had damage. They took the item back and said they would deliver a new on on Monday. I sat at home all day and they never showed. I have spent over 45 minutes on hold trying to get human.

Really good place for home furnishings with great staff. I bought most of my items for my house from this place with assistance of two really helpful and nice staff members Diana and Mazz. They went out of their way to accommodate what I needed. I highly recommend this place for everyone.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I’ve had several experiences with this particular Ashley store, some good and others not that great however, none better than today!

Our sales associate James O’Gara was amazing.  Dare I say the best experience with a sales man I’ve ever had!

We wanted so many different pieces of furniture for multiple rooms but, very indecisive all coming with a ton of questions so as you can imagine we probably weren’t the easiest to help.

James didn’t mind at all. Walked the store with us for hours answering all questions and never once rushed or tried to oversell us making for a very comfortable  experience. Essentially mainly due to to the amazing service James provided we left with furniture for three rooms and a huge smile on our faces..

If looking for furniture and your in the area I recommend stopping by the Yorba Linda Ashely furniture store. Make sure to ask for James.  Hands down best associate to work with!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I went in looking for a new bedroom set for my son. I knew what I wanted because I shopped online but wanted to order in store to ensure I did it all correctly. I also was hoping to see the furniture in person, unfortunately this location didn’t have it but Mehrdad, the associate searched to see if they had it in a tv stand or somewhere else in the store, he also offered to me to go to another location to find it. Loved the fast service and was very happy with my experience. He also matched the price i saw online for one piece, and was able to give me a cheaper price in store for the other. Thank you.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Came to Ashley, and this was the start of a nightmare. we ordered a bunch of furniture, 2 couches, 2 chairs, 2 ottomans, and a love seat.

Delivery comes and the chairs and couches to do not match, even remotely. The took the couches back, but not the chairs.

A couple days later a rug??? is delivered by FedEx. We never ordered one, so hauled that down there to return it to them, and then changed the order, and ordered all new furniture. Which then could not be delivered in time for the holidays. So I had to rent a truck and drive out to Colton to pick it up myself. But it was not all available.

A month or so later they came out to deliver the missing chairs, but not pick up the wrong chairs, so then like 3 weeks later they came and took the chairs and ottomans. Then a couple weeks after that called to schedule to pick up the chairs again, because I guess they were not checked in properly or something.

Looking for an adventure, this is the place... and the sales staff seems to change frequently, every visit spoke with someone different.

I don't feel like we were screwed, but it was pretty stressful.<//Review>

Great store to buy furniture, unfortunately the furniture does not last at all. The Guardsman Insurance is worthless, do not purchase. 90% of all the furniture we own from Ashley's has broken down extensively from just normal wear and tear, it is a shame that the prices do not reflect the durability of the furniture. Great staff but trash furniture.< /Review>

<review>I bought a dining room table here last week and with that table I purchased insurance, so I walked out of the store being told that my table would be covered if any damage occurred. A few days after the purchase I went to pick up my table and we assembled it. Immediately after assembling it we noticed a dent on the edge of the table. Now, I am in the process of moving and I saw this dent and figured I would file a claim with the insurance when I had a chance. I did so a few days later. Now the insurance is telling me that they can’t help me since the dent is so new and occurred and transit and that I should call Ashley Furniture directly. I do so and after being on hold for 30 minutes  their customer service so says no, they can’t help me either because it’s been longer than 72 hours. I’ve had this table for only a week but no one will help me.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I have very high standards. I had one of the best experiences at Ashley's furniture store in Anaheim Hills last night. Ela and Ati were amazing : very customer service oriented . Friendly and demonstrated  a great deal of patience: although it was so late and past the time they should have been there I did not feel rushed and felt very special and taken care of. They went above and beyond my expectations . Thank you for the amazing service. We will definitely be back.<//Text>

My wife and I came in looking for couch repairs, but we were pleasantly surprised by our sales rep, Ati’s knowledge and helpfulness. She showed us many options and we walked away with a fantastic couch at a great price. Without Ati’s help, we would not have purchased that couch.<//Review>

Farshad helped me out immensely. This was my first couch purchase for my first apartment and he made it so nice and easy for me. He was absolutely wonderful.</review>

<text>I had a great experience with my shopping. The store has a good variety and staff are really nice. I’d suggest that you ask for Samar. She is extremely helful, supported me throughout my visit, providing valuable iformation and idea suggestion. Furniture shopping was rather fun instead of stressful this time :)</text>< Pics>

<Text>Wow!! Hard to find another word to explain our experience at Ashley’s! We returned to the store for the 50% off sale in search of a bedroom set and ended up buying TWO bedrooms sets thanks to the hard work of Farshad and Ruben. Farshad worked diligently to answer all our questions, and was fantastic with his follow up texts. Ruben made sure to get us the best possible price, and made us feel like very special customers.

Because of this, we will certainly be back for another bedroom set for the guest room. Thank you!< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>Their customer service is linked to commission. After having them price match a deal online they became incredibly rude, threatened to take financing down to 1 year instead of 3 because they weren't happy with the deal and acted like I was a major inconvenience when I am a customer. also DON'T BUY THE WARRANTY. The guy said it covered pet damage but it doesn't cover any claw marks or rips. What is the use? If they are stil nice to you when you are checking out, walk out... You haven't got a good deal.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
The furniture was delivered on the day we scheduled in the store, 8 days after the date of purchase. It was delivered in good condition except that the bottom shelves of the cabinet are missing the support pins so the glass falls if you touch it. A bit upset that the delivery people did not catch that, but then again I work for a super high end office furniture dealership so I have high expectations. I'm going to need to call them now to get some pins <sigh>. For the money we paid the furniture seems reasonably well built. The display cabinet is very solid and heavy and the couches are light. The couch cushions are not uncomfortable but they are brand new so a bit stiff. The floor models obviously get a lot of use so they were softer and broken in a bit more. I think ours will soften up. Our experience in the store was good and the salesman was friendly and helpful and gave us a very good discount.<//Review>

< review>
We went into the Yorba Linda store looking for couches and ended up with 2 couches, a recliner, and a lamp for way less than what I was expecting to pay for the 2 couches. They were having a 30% off sale plus they have great deals on floor model items! You take the floor model items right then and there and then we opted to pick up the 2 couches at the Colton warehouse to avoid delivery charge. We drove right over and picked them up in a timely manner, no issues at all. Plus, while we were there we purchased 2 area rugs at 45% off. One of the rugs was out of stock so they are delivering it to our home this week at no additional charge. All in all, great furniture shopping experience, good pricing, helpful associates. We will be back for any future furniture needs.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Horrible customer service and professional people. Salesmen are very nice as long as you are making a purchase and after they get their money , It is a nightmare dealing with them. We bought lot of furniture from them worth $5000 and it got delivered a week later. The rug that we got does not stick to the floor. We spoke with the manager of the store at Yorba Linda, CA location and she said it’s an ‘accessory’ and nothing can be done about it. We also called customer service 1-800 number and they said the same thing. We bought rug for $200 and it is new. It is their responsibility to fix it but are not doing anything about it. Will never buy anything from this store. Giving them negative 5 rating. 👎👎👎👎👎

<Review>My husband and I purchased a couch and loveseat on 1/14/2018. Jyoti Sharma was our sales agent and we were very impressed with her ability to draw me in (I'm hard on sales people), answer my questions and concerns and tenaciously work to provide us with the best price.  She was fantastic and the quality of the product is great.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Sherahmad Is something else I would not recommend him or Ashley HomeStore. The lack in quality and return policy make the purchase I’ve made disappointing. I also found the same/similar  iteams on amazon for a fraction of the price with Amazon’s return policy. I would recommend staying away from Ashley’s and purchase else where. My experience and my family experience has been very disappointing.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Your sales associate, Mohammad Kayyali, offered friendly customer service and answered many of my questions about the specific kind of dresser and easy chair that we were looking for. When we found our favorite pieces, he advocated with the manager to bring the price down to be within our budget. What’s more, I learned that Ashley Furniture donates furniture for worthwhile community causes...THAT really impressed me. I found that Ashley furniture has a vast selection of pretty much any kind of high quality furniture that you’re looking for.<//Text>< Rate>

<Review>We Bought our master bedroom furniture from Ashly Yorba linda CA. We explained to the seller that we want to have a mattress for our new king
size bed with normal thickness. the day of delivery when I came back from the work I saw the very thick mattress. the hight of the bed is too high we need to climb to reach it. Now hight of our bed is very uncofortable we are not happy with our purchase from Ashly Yorba Linda.
I contacted them right away two times but despite their promises the seller told me the deliver man took the cover out from the mattress. even if you haven't used it we don't change the mattress. I was very disappointing. He said our manager will follow up. nobody has contacted us after one and half months. the Ashly customer service was horrible. I paid for the whole set of king size bed but they don't care about their customer satisfaction after selling their product.
so unprofessional , NO STAR AT ALL<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I had a really good experience.  My salesperson, Jackie spent a considerable amount of time with me and really listened to what I wanted.  In the end, I bought from a competitor,  but would shop Ashley again anytime.< /Review>

Didn't have a chance to even look around when I entered the showroom. The representative hounded me about checking my credit and a loan approval. They tried to sell me a floor model mattress that was sitting in the showroom and then said they don't deliver mattresses. Told me to go to Home Depot to rent a truck. Asked me how much cash I had on hand to give. That made me feel uncomfortable so I walked away. They called me twice to convince me to come back, that all of a sudden they had a brand new mattress and they would deliver it.< /text>

We had some problems with an earlier purchase and brought to the stores attention. They were good enough to give us a total refund toward a replacement even after 2+ years. We considered this quite fair and we are happy with the replacement.< /Text>

<review>I recently made my final purchase at any Ashley Furniture store. 6 weeks ago I went into this location. Saw the dining room set I wanted and ordered it as shown on the floor.  The salesman entered the wrong item number for the chairs and on delivery day I had to refuse the shipment I was waiting 6 weeks to receive. Now, normally, you would think the store would accept responsibility for their mistake and do anything possible to correct it but no...the people working here give zero f&@$s.  Never again would I go through the nightmare of being a customer of Ashley Furniture.< /review>< name>

Very honest customer service from sales to accounting and delivery.  Bought multiple furniture within an hour. They also provide me information where i can request to remove my old bad furniture.  My experience with the sales  person was answer pass. I highly recommend visiting the store for your high end furniture.

Ashley furniture thank you.<//Review>

We went to Ashley's in Yorba Linda looking into a family room set. We were helped by Maya who gave great advice on furniture to fit our needs. She was easy to work with and didn't mind spending time to show what was availabe in our price range. After taking room measurements we will definitley be back to see Maya.</text>

Unfortunately, I had to come back and update my experience. It went from an almost perfect scenario to a nightmare! I am still awaiting delivery of merchandise.  I am in disbelief that a company could careless about the customer experience! Save yourself the nightmare, shop some place else.</Text>

<Time>1537311832405< /Time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>BEWARE: CROOKS. ESPECIALLY ON HOLIDAY SALES. STAY AWAY FROM RUBEN (Bald guy) AND WILMER!!! You are better off not going to ASHLEY.  Not sure about other employees, but I will tell you this... If Ruben or Wilmer are helping you, leave the store ASAP!  Both are very friendly and act like they want what is best for you... But these guys are both CROOKS and will screw you!  They lie through their teeth just to get a sale.  My wife and I walked in to buy just a bed.  Without asking for our opinion WILMER said that it makes sense to buy more so you can get a larger discount.  we asked to see other mattresses, but he said the tempur-pedic mattress has the best sale and you won't get anything better.  He guaranteed all this   BS about getting store credit and a free headboard and 70% off the rest of bedroom furniture.. Sounded good, but I knew he was just trying to sell like a used car salesman.  We told him that we were unsure about what we wanted as a bedroom set.  His famous words "Don't worry.  If you don't like it, we will take care of you."  I asked him what is the return policy and he said, "If you are not happy, we will take care of you."  But little did he tell us was that was only for the mattress, not the other stuff. Our mistake for not reading the fine print, but at the same time WILMER made it seem that he wanted us to get what we wanted and be satisfied.  I went online to look up their policy and generally stores will take back 30 days after delivery.  BUT eveyr store has a different policy, so this one had a NO RETURN POLICY. When I called WILMER and asked about making a swap.  He said his famous words "Don't worry, we will take care of you. I will call you back." Never called me back.  I went into the store and RUBEN was there.  At this point, I knew that the policy is their policy, but at least they would work with us.  INSTEAD, Ruben said " I don't know where you come off thinking you can return stuff you bought?  You can't do anything and we won't take it back. You picked it and it is your problem now" (EXACT WORDS).  Then he went off saying that I am trying to scam them.  He tried to strong arm me to make me just go away. I am 100% sure that this is a weekly routine because he knew what he was going to say before I even spoke.  The customer care is also trained on handling this situation.  I expressed my opinion and told him don't you ever talk to me like that. I called him a crook in front of customers and stormed off.  He tried to get me to shut up because his other potential customers were listening to what I was saying. I have never been talked down to by someone I just gave business to.. BTW, I am a purchasing director as profession so I understand this business and I have never dealt with a vendor as bad as this (trust me I had several bad ones.  There is no point to go beyond and calling customer service because they won't listen and don't care.  I HIGHLY recommend not buying from ASHLEY.  There "SALES and DISCOUNTS" are fabricated to look like your saving money, but you are not.  Don't be fooled like we were. A lot of these reviews were from initial store experience, which was great too... But CUSTOMER SATISFACTION is not in ASHLEY'S vocabulary.</Text>< Pictures>

The service in the store was great, but getting the furniture from their delivery service took way too much effort. We brought 4 pieces furniture only three were delivered together on Thursday but not the fourth piece because it was damaged. (which we do appreciate them checking before delivery, but) We were told by the delivery guy & customer service that called later that day that the fouth piece would deliver the next day, Friday. Friday came, we didn't hear from them so we called them and they said oh it didn't go out today so they will try to get it back out to us later on Friday or the next day Saturday; but either way they will call us by the end of the day and give us an update. Did we hear from them? Of course not, here it is Saturday, we still have not heard from them so we called them again and they said well it wasn't scheduled for today either and since Monday is a holiday they can schedule it for next week after Monday. We asked them to please schedule delivery for tomorrow since we've been put off day after day by them after being told over and over again it'll be the next day. They reluctantly agreed to put us on the delivery schedule for Sunday. Hopefully we'll actually get it tomorrow. So out of curiosity if we haven't called day after day would they have have just kept our fourth piece of furniture which just happen to be the most expensive piece? Needless to say we are not happy with the whole experience.

Here it is Sunday still have not heard from delivery people. So called them again Appearantly we are scheduled today. So we are hopeful< /text>

<user_name>monster tiger< /user_name><Review>We came to look for a sectional couch and Maaz helped us. Great experience. He listened to what we wanted and quickly adapted when he noticed we didn't care for what was shown. We found a great reclining sectional that was sturdy and supportive for my husband who is a powerlifter. It was comfy and visually appealing. Delivery is scheduled for before Christmas so hopefully it comes in time. I will be back to this store to furnish my other room. Thank you Maaz!< /Review>< GmapID>

This place sucks!  My wife wanted some furniture from here that was in an ad. She called and they told her that they have but it's not on the floor. Just come in and ask for Mohammed is what they said. Mohammed was really nice. But he lied. They didn't have the furniture we wanted. Thank you for wasting my time.</review>

NOWW I GET WHAT THIS PLACE IS ABOUT!!!
Always heard commercials, but never went in... until today.

For over 1 month I was trying to figure out the best bed for my back... (L1 & L2 spinal injury from a compression fracture when I was young).
Today, I went there to try a specific mattress that they had on display. They offered me a nap to try it out - haha - I accepted! I didn't end up sleeping, but I did buy the mattress.

If you enjoy living comfortably, and "peace of mind" is important to you.. then JUST VISIT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF HOW NICE THIS PLACE IS. CREATIVE FURNITURE - LOVED LOTS OF THINGS HERE.< /Text>

<Review>I will not purchase anything from there again. Purchase a bedroom set and they're very helpful when you're buying furniture. But if there's a problem with it they're not that helpful. One of the dresser came part when we opened the drawers for the first time. We let the know the same day but instead of replacing the item they want to send someone to fix it. Not happy at all with that the dresser it is supposed to be new.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Ended up overpaying for our couch.   Found it online for $600 less.  We also purchased the room accessories, and 4 months later, we still have not received our coffee table, our rug, or our side tables.  We took out a line of credit thru the store.  I paid it off as soon as i got the bill.   Then a month later they charged the credit card again without our approval.  Had to immediately cancel the line of credit and report the fraudulent charge.  If I could give this store 0 stars, I would.   Nothing but overcharged merchandise, followed but fradulent activity.  And after 4 months, they still owe us merchandise.<//text>

I wanted to buy home furniture. I met their Associate Maaz who was very helpful in explaining all about the items they carry. With his help we were able to get the furniture we wanted at very good rates. Keep it up.

Few weeks back went to this store again got a fantastic deal from Khawaja Maaz and the store manager Ruben. Thanks. Keep up the good work.< /Review>

<review>My wife and I went in to Ashley in Yorba Linda and met with Sher Ahmadyar today June 16th. We were searching for a headboard for our Cal King bed and we ended leaving the store with not only a headboard, but 2 reclining power sofas, and a 5 piece bedroom set. The customer service was tremendous as my wife and I took quite some time to decide on the furniture pieces. Sher saw us through from beginning to end and there was never any pressure applied on us to purchase the extra items. We love Ashley furniture and will continue to purchase from them in the future.

Had an amazing experience at this location. Was greeted by Omid at the door. He took me around the store explaining where everything is. I took 4 hours looking around every item and Omid and the store manager, Austin stopped by every 10-15 minutes to answer any questions I had. I truly loved this experience of having no pressure to purchase something that very moment. Once I was ready to purchase everything, I was given an amazing deal. I can honestly say that I will be making all my future purchases through Omid and Austin. Thank you for all of your help yesterday.<//review>

This place deserves 0 stars. I have a 4 year old leather couch I bought with the protection plan. The couch has horrible peeling and is so insightly. The plan refuses to cover any of the warranty and Ashley only guarantees their couch for one year. Do yourself a favor and buy  better quality from someone who stands behind their products.<//text>

<text>I was assisted by Sher. I'm in the market for a mattress and wanted to see what this particular location had to offer until I made a final decision. Nice sales rep. However, A BIT PUSHY. He told me no one has ever left their store not making a purchase.  Not only did I feel pressure, it was an uncomfortable experience. Even when I was leaving the store and walking through certain areas on the sales floor he was following me. I stopped to talk to my son and the sales rep stopped as well. I dont appreciate that and that made my overall experience unpleasant and will not go back to this particular HomeStore. My favorite Ashley location is in Montclair.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dcd1d9a6a96985:0x492f093bc7603369</gmapID></record>

Tonight, went into Ashley HomeStore with no intent of purchasing anything, as I was accompanying my friend who is currently reorganizing her room. Subsequently, I fell in love with one of the comforters/bed sets that was absolutely GORGEOUS and would totally work well with the color scheme in my room. Walked away and disappointed as soon as I saw the price. That is until AUSTIN, the store manager, approached us, and wouldn't allow us to leave without hearing him out. Ended up offering me $140 off the bed set, and I couldn't say no. Additionally, he saved my friend over $700 on her new desk, chair, delivery/installment, and threw in a throw blanket. Between the two of us, all our items should have cost a little over $1500... but we walked away with $715 for everything! Austin treated us like VIP, and he is a rockstar at what he does. Thank you Austin!!!!!<//Text>

<Text>I had been looking at multiple online and local furniture stores to replace a queen and twin bedroom set.  As soon as we walked into Ashly’s we were immediately greeted by Sher Ahmadyar.  He let us know the current sales available and asked us How he could help.  He was very genuine and in no way pushy.  My wife and I looked around and found the furniture not only great quality but also what we were looking for. Once we decided on what we wanted, Sher worked with us on pricing and options available. Sher gave us great customer service and really made us feel not only welcome, but like we were valued customers. I have purchased from Jerome’s in Anaheim and some local places in Orange County and felt like the products were  just ok, I was being nickle  and dimed for every little thing, or up sold as much as possible.  After my experience tonight I will only be going to Ashly’s and dealing with Sher, he was honestly great!  Thank you!!<//Text><name>Gavin Miller</name>< Pics>

Veronica was our sales rep.  Very helpfull took her time showing us the product and she clearly understand our needs. She even offered us an extened warranty.. which  at the begining i did not see a use for it but after her detail explanation we boght  it. Defiantly  will contact or refer my friends to her... she made sure that we will get what we need.Very happy with the outcome. Waiting to see our new sofa soon. If you want to enjoy your visit ask for veronica ..< /Review>

Do not buy anything from this company. My father is a disabled Vet and went in to buy a mattress he told the salesman Sergio that he could not sleep on a firm mattress because of health problems and he sold us a mattress that he said would be perfect for us... We have it delivered and and find out he sold us a firm mattress I called to tell Ashleys that this was the wrong mattress and they basicly to us sorry you signed for it, it is your problem. They will do nothing to help us. This is an awful company.<//text>

I purchased my couch, dining table, kitchen  island, Tempurpedic mattress, and desk,  and Palvi helped me through it all. I visited the store numerous times and even brought my mom. Palvi was super patient and was able to help us with the best deals! She was extremely responsive to all my texts and questions. I was very impressed with the customer service I received from Palvi and would recommend coming to visit this Ashley location.< /Review>

You must read all reviews and it's a must to look at consumer affairs Web site. You will be surprised on how we are all blinded by the belief in the name, come to find out that they are just the same or worse then a little private vendors on the main Boulevard. Even though you ask questions, ask some more, and then some more. You we see through there trained schemed pitched lines, from warranty, return policies, customer service. Please, please, don't fall for the questionable tactics, un responsive management, talking over and down talking tactics. Stand your ground if you choose to purchase and it is a strainious relationship with constant follow up on the customer behalf.< /text>

< review>
Let me start by saying that I don't usually post negative reviews because I like to give everyone the benefit of having a bad day or such, but 2 bad encounters with the same person weeks apart must mean something. Anyway, we have shopped at Ashley for many years, but usually at their Colton location. We have since moved from that area and have shopped at this location at Savi twice - both times included rude service from the manager. (I forget her name, but she is the blonde one with tattoos.) How she ever got to be Manager is beyond me! In addition to her rudeness, she couldn't even do simple math on the items we were trying to purchase, and argued with us on the price. Both of our encounters involved using gift cards that we received from the Colton store due to promotions they had on a  large purchase that we made.
The manager treated us as if we were low life's that were trying to get one over on the store. She tried telling us we could not use the gift card for sale items, and was not going to give us change, or a smaller amount gift card for the difference of the purchase. She was going to keep the change! The time before we returned an item and she was not going to allow it because we purchased it with a gift card even though we were fine with being refunded store credit or another gift card. Both times she was wrong, and extremely rude, making silly comments that were completely unwarranted, such as suggesting that we were just going to return the item later for cash. The rest of the staff here are great. It was actually entertaining watching them roll their eyes behind her back, as they must unfortunately have to deal with her incompetence on a daily basis.
We still have some gift card left and will make the longer drive to another location.< /review>

<Text>My mom and I went to Ashley Furniture last week and had the best experience. Omid walked us through the whole store and took notes of all the items we wanted. He was patient and very friendly. We can't thank Omid enough! He and Rueben also helped us pick the best financing options possible. We couldn't be happier with the customer service; it was the best. We will definitely be coming back to Ashley for our future furniture needs.< /Text>< gmapID>

< Review>
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stay clear of this company and especially this store. the furniture is of the lowest possible quality.

They do not back their products or products they sell. I, like many customers purchased the scam guardsmen plan. ITS A SCAM!!!

After you read some of these reviews please ask yourself why is furniture less than a year old breaking down so easily or upon delivery????

Buyer beware, I called the store manager today to ask if there was anyway possible she could help me with my issue with guardsmen. If there was a representative from guardsmen she could contact, to help me get through since I've been given the run a round.  Diane rudely suggested I call them and deal with them myself.

UMMM hello I just told you I called them 10 times. Spent several hours. No sympathy, no customer service. I was reading online how a different customer from Lazyboy had a problem with guardsmen and how lazy boy step in to take care of the customer.

Diane and her lack of customer service is just one of the  many reasons why you should avoid this place.<//Review>

The quality does not present itself until you get it home. JUNK. We take pride and care in our belongings, no misuse. The faux leather is flaking off in MANY locations. The EXTENDED warranty we paid for is worthless. The extended warranty people say it sounds like a manufacturer defect. Ashley says sorry you only have a year warranty. The couches are two years old. Will NEVER buy another product from Ashley.< /Review>

Super pushy sales people, high prices, virtually no other color selection then wht your looking at (according to our sales woman) Found a recliner we liked if it came in any shade of gray/charcoal. Comes back after mins on pc & says good news we have same chair in gray, different outer handle release, the 1 on floor had inner rip cord like release. Shows us chair online, it's clearly a different chair, she keeps lying saying same chair (it's CLEARLY not). Went home & dug into their website, found the chair she was pushing & it was 100 less then she was offering when she claimed it was the other more expensive (discountinued) chair. Living spaces was awesome. Go to living spaces< /text>

BEWARE...of Sher Ahmadyar, a sales associate!!  I came in 2 different days shopping for bedroom furniture.  The first day he was friendly and helpful, but I had to leave to pick-up my daughter.  We texted back and forth about pricing and delivery and settled on the perfect deal. The second day, I came back to sign but found another set I liked better and that's when things got ugly. He became pushy, rude, and irritated.  By the end of that day he was texting "You didn't really want the furniture, you waste my time two times, and thank you for that".  He did finish off by saying "Have a good day".
News Flash!!!...Customers are entitled to change their minds, its their money without being harassed by sales associates.  He gives Ashley Furniture a bad reputation as I've notice other reviews mention him as well.<//Review>

Sher Ahmadyar is absolutely hands down the best in town! I highly recommend Ashley Furniture and Sher Ahmadyar for assistance. He definitely knows what he is talking about. Uber attentive, accommodating and friendly.. He made our experience at Ashley Furniture stress free and calming. We enjoyed shopping and we definitely left with a smile on our face. I will definitely refer others to you and thank you again Mr. Sher Ahmadyar for your wonderful customer service! With great appreciation!

You're the Best,

very bad and rude. Yola ( lebanese sales rep.) was very rude to us. Almost every product they offer you will take over 1 month to deliver !! other furniture stores either have it on same day or in 2-5 days. The manager was totally unprofessional and doesnt know how treat customers well.

We went there to spend thousands of dollars and for the treatment we will never deal with them!! go somewhere else to buy your furniture !!< /Text>

Very pushy sales persons and managers who stalked and mock us after we tell our budget, but even after spending a fortune here they delivered a broken piece of furniture. Even after 2 weeks of filing a complain to fix NOTHING!
We called them but they couldn't find the word "bent" in their system to send technician out!! Never stepping in this store again.<//review>

They delivered the wrong box spring and after spending 2 days on hold and getting shifted from one department to the next I am no closer to having the right product that I paid for.

During this experience I was treated very rudely by the store sales manager Katherine Gonzalez. Horrible experience.<//Review>

BEWARE:   I purchased a loveseat 3 weeks ago and was told it would be 2 1/2 weeks for delivery.  I received  notification 3 days ago it would be delivered today 8/17/14  I also received text message that it would arrive between 1215-415pm.  Now its 8/17 and   I just received a call at 230pm stating it was back ordered for another month.  WHAT CRAP!  The dispatcher was an idiot.  I called the store and spoke with a supervisor Sue ( would not even give full name) who was also worthless. This is horrible customer service I cancelled my order and have told numerous people to not use this store. Mary Russ</Text>
