Just like any 2nd hand store, sometimes u find great stuff, others u don't. U have to keep looking and try different locations, over all I like this store because is close to where I live, its big, its clean but do not like that fitting rooms are still close so u have to try what u can how ever u can.</Text>

I usually shop here but some of prices here are very unreasonable. I'm moving temporarily for renovation purposes. Anyways came in looking for tote bag or a suitcase. Only 1 suitcase for 12.99 (as is) and i also found a tote bag priced for 14.99. I looked up the brand of the tote bag and suitcase brand new the suitcase is worth a lot more then the tote bag. It is only 12.99 brand new. So when I ask them to explain the prices she said one is (as is) and the other isn't which obviously leads me to believe that they don't do fact-checking. The tote bag brand new never used is cheaper. Yet it's more expensive.?! Make absolutely no sense</text>

I went to the Salvation Army, saw a piece I liked and asked for help because I didn't think it would fit in my car. The person offered to help me take it out to see if it would fit. I said it looks like you can dismantle it, I only wanted to borrow an Alan key. He insisted on dismantling it for me. That's what Salvation Army is like.

At Goodwill, I asked if I could see if a table fit in my car. I was told that no, I couldn't do that. If I bought it and immediately found it didn't fit, they wouldn't offer any exchanges or refunds, even if I'd just bought it two minutes ago. That's what Goodwill is like.< /Text>

Brought my car packed full of items and was in the parking lot before their “donation” area closed. I go inside and politely ask if I could donate my items and the three workers all got pretty defensive and said they didn’t see me and rudely told me it’s closed. That’s fine if it’s closed but you could at least be nice about it and not give attitude lol< /review>

Place looks really good, it's very clean, high tech type of laundromat. On the bad side, the girl who's here is completely an ass. Me and my friend came in and looked lost, she walked by us without any type of greeting, then when I asked how many loads was a certain washer she literally gave me a "are u dumb look" they should hire a better clerk...< /review>

<Review>I love this Goodwill. I find something I can't live without every time I visit (about once every two months). I like how everything is color coordinated (shoes, clothes), and the store is roomy and well organized. Staff is friendly and helpful.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80d953f56fcc4285:0xaf58fd2af8ccb7b7< /gmap_id></record>

I hope the workers are getting a good paycheck, because those prices are high for type of store.  I remember when I could get an outfit for 10.00..not no more. Double now.</text>< Rate>

Most of the store's goods are clothes, and most of the clothes are visible worn out. I think you could find for a couple of bucks more, some new clothes on clearance. The personal was not very welcoming, just doing their jobs<//text>

I think thrift stores in general can be hit or miss, each time you go. This visit was OK, stuff was pretty well organized. Pricing seemed pretty arbitrary, but that is common with thrift stores. I got some decent board shorts for $5. Overall, I didn't find that much stuff I was interested in. I'm used to stores with lots of electronics- dvd players, monitors, speakers, computers etc. This store kind of felt like an older person's garage sale. Mostly out of style decorations and junk. I didn't really look through the clothes much, though, so there might be some good stuff in there.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I want to tell the people who work in this store that you are absolutely talented.  I was in there today waiting in line to check out and I happened to look up toward the back of the store and I was awestruck by several of your "table top" displays.  My eye was directed from one table top to the other and ending  at the back of the store on an oversized framed picture.  Each display contained a myriad of objects (paper mache flowers, a giant vase, small framed picture, more glassware, objects d'art etc) color coordinated and displayed just so your eye would skip to the next "stepping stone" display.  I made my companion come back in the store just to check it out.  She was suitably impressed.  You are a talented group of employees. It actually made me want to buy all that stuff to take home and set it up just like you did.  Very attractive, yet subtle. In addition, this is the cleanest, most organized of all the Goodwills in San Diego and certainly the best of all the other kinds of thrift shops I've ever been in.  Thank you for taking good care of my shopping place.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Nice clean store with friendly people. It seems since the remodle that the prices have gone up a couple of dollars or more on shirts.I think $7.99 to 14.99 for a decent dress shirt is expensive. What happened to $5.99?. Plus they cherry pick the good stuff and put it on different rack that they call boutique. Then they use a red marker on the collar of the boutique items.That effectively ruins the shirt in my opinion. I went to two Goodwills today and came away with nothing. The racks were packed way to tight, probably because people in this economy are not willing to pay the prices.</text>

This place is so good. We ate here a couple of weeks ago while visiting Jackson and we really enjoyed our Panini that we made a special trip out there for lunch. People are friendly, food is good and the deli is cozy.< /Review>

The Sherwood Executive Center is a clean and professional environment that houses a variety of different businesses.  The staff are extremely friendly and try their best to solve any problems you have.  For being in town, the building feels safer than the nearby malls.<//Text>

This place is the best, I came in with a bad tattoo and Gus did a EXCELLENT job with a couple cover up pieces. The consultation and the tattoo-ing was perfect. Gus made sure I was always comfortable throughout the whole thing. Not only is the type of work is off the charts, so are the people that work here. From the moment I came in to make an appointment til even after I got work done, they have treated me like family. I will continue to come and get more work done by who I now call family at Art of the Heart!!! Job well done guys!👏< /Text>

< Review>
Really great service and our artist was really understanding of what we wanted and went above and beyond for us. Come here for a bachelorette party of three and our artist took time to figure out what we each wanted and provided exactly what we had hoped. Very happy with each of ours and the bride especially, our artist was extra careful because of her condition which makes her feel pain more than most. Definitely would go back. Great service and great price. Really had a good time.</Review>

<review>Best place to get high quality tattoos. I've never been happier with a tattoo shop, they have amazing deals and they really care and give you the best service ever! I've had multiple tattoos from everyone at the shop, you won't be disappointed!

<Name>Madeline Wien< /Name><text>I found my new tattoo place!!!! I have been to a couple shops for my pervious tattoos but never felt as comfortable as I did with them. Gus did an amazing job helping decide on the size for the location I was thinking. And is helping me plan out my next tattoo in a couple weeks. They are very fair in prices and do a great job, but not only are they a tattoo shop but they have a very nice rockabilly clothing shop, if I had more time and more money I would have done some shopping.  They have really cute purses, and the dresses are super cute and they have more than you think. They have larger sizes which is nice for everyone who wants to dress in the rockabillyrockabilly fashion. They also doing piercing, gave me something to think about,it might need to have something done. Faith and Gus are amazing and have a awesome shop. Definitely going back.</text>< gmap_id>

Gus is by far one of the most talented and respectable artist I have ever dealt with. He is not a hassle to deal with, does not act like a "entitled" tattoo artist, and will not blow smoke up your a** just to make a sale. Gus's commitment to the craft is just what Morgan Hill needs.</Review>

I would recommend that everyone who is looking for a great all around Dentist and staff to try Dr. Hillock. He is very good at explaining what needs to be done and how he is going to do it. He is straight up about it no powder coating no trying to  make it work so you have to keep coming back. The staff is always courteous and will answer any questions you have. They also are very positive, easy to talk to  and make you feel comfortable no matter how bad your dental needs are. I will be patient there for as long as they will have me. I appreciate everything they have done for me thank you Dr. Hillock and Staff.<//Review>

As a new patient, I felt  very comfortable and taken care of. Regina broke down my insurance benefits to me. Lupita and Dr. Hillock explained the dental procedures I need in simple terms. Val, the Hygienist did an awesome job with my cleaning. Very gentle but thorough. I would recommend this dental office to all friends and family.<//Review>

<Review>I have a fear of needles, and just any kind of medical work done on me due to my near death experience with penicillin from a doctor prescribing medication. They were completely so comforting and patient, they made me feel safe and understood, which is all I could ever ask for and is rare to find, Toni, is such a loving kind hearted soul and she took care of me every step of the way with my anxiety attacks, or fears. I would highly recommend this place for anyone, ask for Toni too! She’s phenomenal. Must I not forget about Dr Hillock, he’s fast and amazing at what he does, he takes care of your dental work and makes sure you leave the place with a good experience.</Review><gmap_id>0x809056a607ac7f81:0x1963f4d2fa4920d9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have enjoyed my experience at this office and have a few shout outs to give! First of all, I would like to thank Valerie for recommending me to Hillock Family Dental. Regina for checking my insurance benefits in a timely manner. Lupita for being patient with me while taking my X-rays. And lastly Toni for being so thorough while prepping me for my wisdom teeth removal appointment. I look forward to all future appointments with these friendly ladies. Thank you Hillock Family Dental for an overall pleasant and easy going visit!< /Review>

Love it here!! Doctor Hillock is warm thoughtful and funny!! His demeanor puts you at easy and I didn't even have time to worry about my injections (terrified of needles!!). Miss Cathy and Miss Toni are GREAT!! Super friendly and nice. When my wife was having a hard time Miss Toni sat with her and helped her through it. As long as we can make it will be going to Hillock Family Dental!!<//review>

I get my orthodontic treatment (braces) done here at Hillock Family Dental. Today I had an ortho appointment. I would like to point out that Christina from the front desk greeted me with a warm welcome and Sandy, the ortho assistant is amazing! She makes every monthly visit an enjoyable one. Always prepared, professional & positive. I know my teeth are in good hands with both Dr. Hillock & Sandy.< /review>

<text>Hillock Family Dental is the best. Ive been through alot with my teeth problems and if it wasnt for Toni I probably would have given up by now. But she has encouraged me to power through all of this and I know Hillock Family Dental has my health as there top priority. There prices are reasonable and there dedication to the patient is absolutely outstanding. My father recommended me here and I strongly recommend anyone that needs help to contact Hillock Family Dental.<//text>< Pictures>

Staff was great as always! Lupita was awesome with me and my my son she kept me updated while we were in separate rooms. Val and Lupita both took the time to answer questions and let us know what they were doing before they did it or asked if it was okay. Dr Sarkissian is so nice and very thorough answered any questions.< /Text>

Super easy upon arrival, no wait time, and straight the the dentist chair. Overall each phase of the visit was seamless, I felt like the staff loves working there making me feel very comfortable in a friendly environment. Each one of the staff had answers to all my questions. Continue the great work ladies!< /Text>

The dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants are all extremely nice and informative. You will not have any hassles or worries with Hillock Family Dental like some other places that give you a hard time. The staff seem to actually like their jobs and their patients so you get a positive experience all around. If you are a person who's afraid of the dentist and struggle to find someone who fits your needs or simply just looking for a better dentist that listens to you, Hillock Family Dental is the way to go.< /text>

<Review>Dr hetno and his dental assistant were incredibly insulting I paid him $10,000 to fix my teeth and the entire time he talked to the assistant about the wrinkles on my face and pimples and whatever else he found unattractive. oh I'm sorry did they fail to mention he's an incredibly unattractive human being himself and he's actually pretty disgusting<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Words can’t express how amazing Hillock Dental truly is! Let me start off by saying that I have NEVER had a good experience at a dental office before. I found this dental office about four years ago when my I switched health plans and was impressed based on their reviews. I was blown away by how comfortable Dr. Sarkissian made me feel, actually listened to my concerns, and took the time to educate me on dental health. She’s has such a positive attitude and is very educated. After my first visit, I made my parents and siblings switch over to Hillock Dental and they have never been happier! We continue to receive outstanding service at all of our appointments. The front office staff, dental assistants and hygienists are all great too! Thanks Hillock Dental for everything you guys do!</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I work in a profession where my customers review my performance based on one encounter. A bad day on either parts can result in a negative survey. Therefore, I waited to review Hillock Family Dental until multiple visit. I can say, without doubt or uncertainty, I'm beyond pleased. From the front office staff, Regina and Cristina, to my favorite hygienist, Monica, and finally, Dr. Sarkissian. They are fantastic. Helpful, informative and most important, encouraging. I am, by far, so happy to have done my research (by reading these reviews) prior to choosing a new dental office. They are the BEST!! Thank you Hillock Family Dental, for making going to the dentist enjoyable again.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809056a607ac7f81:0x1963f4d2fa4920d9<//gmapID></record>

<Text>Dr. Hillock and his staff were very professional and friendly. They did a crown and cleaning for me and also did an exam as well as an extraction and filling for my 9 year old son. His staff reassured my son and eased all fears that he had and did a great job on my crown. My son was nervous initially about visiting the dentist. Since coming here that has changed... He no longer fears the dentist. We will be patients at Hillock for years to come. Highly recommend!!! Emma and Lupita are awesome!!<//Text>< rating>

I do not enjoy the dentist, it’s always been a big fear of mine while also experiencing past bad experiences from multiple different dentist offices. Hillock Family Dental is the best dentistry I’ve ever been too. I can be highly emotional, but the staff and Dr. Hillock himself are amazing, patient, and understanding the entire time. I feel comfortable being in their hands.<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Hillock is absolutely amazing. I have a lot of anxiety about dentist but him and his staff took care of me extremely well. He talked me through everything and what he was doing. His staff were very supportive and helped me through my experience. I would definitely recommend him to anyone that has dental needs and is any fears/afraid of the dentist. He truly cares about his patients and their needs.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Had a terrible customer service experience today with Christina. I called to check-in to an appointment and found that I was 17 minutes late. Understandably, they were unable to see me due to tight scheduling during the Covid-19 restrictions.

I then asked what I could do as I have a wisdom tooth coming in and need it dealt with as soon as possible (in alot of pain) and Christina continued to say "you should have been on time". I got the same response in a number of ways until I lost my tempermant and simply said "I dont care about that, what do I do NOW? I need a path forward."

To that I was met with a silent pause, then a restrained "OK sir." Another pause "if you can be ON-TIME, we have an appointment for 10 am tomorrow" - I hung up the phone in lieu of responding harshly.

Its difficult to put into words the attitude that was conveyed in Christina's voice, suffice it to say that it was enough to warrant a review, and I sincerely hope that Dr. Hillock works with his staff on their candor - he has already lost at least my business as I have scheduled an appointment with a competitor and I will be sharing this review on whatever platforms that I can so others can avoid being treated with such little respect.<//Review>

Staff is awesome, super friendly, excellent dental hygienist all these epithets do not show how quality this office works. Dr. Hillock has so many letters and awards in each room, but just simple tooth fillings he did not do properly. It was really fast, but I was waiting around 30 minutes. Before that he made 5 shots of anesthesia, so I did not feel anything, but after this procedure my tooth and jaw was hurting me other 5 days until different doctor fixed this problem.< /Review>

This place is amazing! I definitely recommend it! If you’re like me you’re scared of the dentist. They do everything they can to make it as enjoyable as possible. I’ve never felt this comfortable at any dentistry. Keep up the good work you guys!!</text>

I’ve been going to Hillock Family Dental for about 2 years now. Super friendly service and I never have to sit in the waiting room for too long. I had my orthodontics done here and they were always very clear about my treatment plan. Emma is a super kind hygienist and made sure to be very gentle with my sensitive teeth and offered different suggestions on how I could help resolve the issue.<//text>

DR. ORIANNA SARKISSIAN, DDS is the best. I am unbelievably petrified of the dentist and she made me feel so relaxed and comfortable and it did not hurt the way that I had imagined. I would refer her to anyone that I know in fact I have a family member that's calling today to make an appointment with her! The whole staff is amazing I just love this place<//Text>

I  have always been reluctant going to the dentist office, so I have put it off for many years. I finally got back around going, and I'm glad I chose Hillock Dental. My dental hygienist, Kelly, was amazing! She listened to my concerns and didn't judge me for my not so clean teeth. She made sure I was comfortable during the visits I had with her. I will be looking forward going to her again.<//review>

<Text>This place takes a lot more patients than they can handle which results in EXTREMELY POOR  and rushed services. hillock is very messy with his work because hes always trying to hurry up and doesn’t care if he’s doing a good job or not. If you bring any concern to his attention he gets mad and start acting like a little kid, no profesiomism at all.  hes very ugly looking  too.<//Text>< pics>

Dr Hillock is straight forward in what he recommends. Dr Sarkissian has a very caring touch.
This office offers everything from regular checkups to implants and wisdom teeth extractions and also offer IV sedation.
This office is well worth the visit.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Dr hillock and his team are amazing. they have a very clean environment and great service. I've been going there for a few years now and ever since I started going they treated me like friend and I feel welcome everytime I go. I'm probably one of there hardest patients to go there and I give them all hard times because I hate going to the dentist but I feel comfortable there and everytime I walk out i feel happy again.

I have been a patient of Dr. Hillock for almost 20 years, I don't like that all the gals who work there are always smiling and asking if I need anything, I don't like that the hygienist always does a great job cleaning my teeth. As for Dr.Hillock, I don't like that he always does a perfect job on my teeth, and is very diligent at what he does. So if you don't  want a great staff and doctors your going to have to go somewhere else.

<review>I visited HIllock Dental a week ago - I was terrified to go and had the worst anxiety. The entire staff I interacted with made me feel comfortable. The understood the anxiety and fear, and made it known that my entire experience would be comfortable. The assistant who worked with me was phenomenal! Dr. Sarkissian was AMAZING!  I went home feeling good about things and returned the next day for a procedure. I was much more calm going in and was confident I was right where I should be. My procedure was smooth and my experience was again, amazing. I am grateful for the patience, understanding, and compassion that this team gives their patients. For as long as I am in this area, I will be a patient of Dr. Sarkissian! Thank you HIllock Family Dental for a favorable experience!< /review><rate>5</rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Katrina Lake</Name><response>None< /response>< user>

Very efficient, charming, and making it feel like a great pleasure to be there. I look forward to coming back (hopefully without a serious dental problem!) If I do have a problem the same kindness will carry over to whatever technical work I need.

My biggest worry is cost but I sense that if I needed time to pay in an emergency they wouldn't turn me away at the door. Of course, I really hope I don't have to test that belief! Payments are important to any business, but I sense Dr Hillock would somehow ease any financial pain too, and help work something out.

The office is full of smiling toothiness, and high spirits. And my cleaning? Oh yesssss. I leave wanting to kiss everybody. Oh well. I resist the temptation and move on to another happy encounter in six months.

Be sure to check Dr. Hillock's generous monthly payment service. For a few dollars I feel like I have no worries and get what ever routine exams etc, that they determine I need. No holding back.

Top Quality Dentistry.

Hillock is very inappropriate with women and throws tantrums in the office. I had to switch to another orthodontist mid treatment because he was disgusting to deal with and very sloppy with his work. Do not go here unless you want every visit to be a bad experience.</review>

I visit this spot a lot since I work close by. I love how their service is always fantastic and they keep the spot well organized consistently. Prices are affordable and they serve sizeable portions.</text>

She had nasty attitude,never once checked on us.we had to approach her and ask her for chips and salsa,and again for our drinks.Each time we were given a dirty look and a irritated attitude. She act as if she hated her job and us. We paid for our food and drinks.We had to ask for 2 more drinks and when we went to pay for 1 coke and 1 jarrito she charged us $8 for the 2 drinks,when we had paid only $4 for our first 2 drinks (same drinks).,Then FLAT OUT IGNORED US when we asked why the same 2 drinks were more  expensive. She REFUSED TO ANSWER. Never giving an answer and tons of dirt looks and nasty attitude,we paid and left. We drove from Marysville to eat there on our way to Redding because we had eaten there many times b4,when we get a chance. But we won't ever eat there or recommend to anyone as long as that lady is there serving.We would never wish it upon anyone to be treated as we were ..like I said "the food is excellent".and hopefully this problem gets fixed.< /Review></record>

Nope. Never got a chance to try the food bc after trying to smile and catch someone's eye for about 4 minutes I gave up!
Neither employee or the two men eating at a table were wearing masks, so if that's how you roll this is the place!
No greeting and no acknowledgment and the one not on the phone was just staring into space...no idea.
First and last time, looked pretty expensive anyway compared to the other restaurants nearby.< /Text>

Great authentic Mexican food with everything homemade! Service was nice and prompt however the other customers that day were loud and obnoxious due to intoxication. Unpleasant for a family with a newborn. But again, food was amazing. Best Mexican food I have had.<//review>

<Review>Best tortillas I’ve ever had right here at La Plaza and the rest of the food as well is very good, I definitely plan on making future visits alone and along with friends/family and for a staff of 2 people the food was out quick and the service was good I paid $51 for 3 plates of spicy shrimp which also includes rice, beans, tortillas, tortilla chips with good salsa and the option of tapatio</Review>< pictures>

Love that they always have fresh homemade tortillas (never store bought type corn tortillas). Some of the most authentic Mexican food restaurants in town along with one other place. Also open the earliest of Mexican restaurants in town.</text>

The food was good but a few things to know. The water is bottled at $2 a peice. There is no tea or advocado. To add chili Verde meat to Huevos rancheros cost the whole price of a dinner plate or about $14 for just  a small amount of added meat. For that reason I probably won't come back. Positives: the food was great, the salsa was Awesome. Place is Authentic and real Mexican food. Service was good but salsa bowls are so small waitress has to spend wasted time getting extra salsa. A few small changes and I would start eating here on a monthly basis.< /Text>

Don't let the outside fool you the food was fantastic and at a great price and the woman inside was kind enough to direct us to some vendors set up outside the church across the street for some wonderful refreshing drinks. Will definitely be our favorite place to go on Sunday for lunch.<//Review>

A Taste of Michoacán, Great food at a fair price with menudo all week long!
Burritos are massive and flavorful, rice had good flavor (unlike some other restaurants in the area) beans made authentic and deletions the way your Tia makes them. Menudo, simply put is the best you can get without going to see your Abuelita on Sunday after church. Plenty of tripe, deep rich flavor and best of all cooked with pigs feet. Seen a review on here complaining about ceviche, They don’t even have ceviche so that review if total BS! I know I know, you see me photo and think “what does that wedo know?” but I am half Mexican, grew up around Mexican family and the amazing authentic food. Trust me, I’ve been overfed by all of my Tias and cant stand store bought tortilla.< /Text>

< Review>
We called Lemon Grove Transmission after driving from Yuma, AZ and the steering on our F150 got very wobbly. Initially Jeff said he wouldn’t be able to get to our truck until Monday. This was a Wednesday when we dropped off the truck. When he found out we were from out of town he moved us up to the front of the line which we didn’t expect, but sure appreciated. We suspected the rack and pinion was bad but it turned out that one of our front tires was separating and was out of round. He also found a bad tie rod to be causing our problem. Long story short, we would definitely recommend Jeff and Lemon Grove Transmission for your car repair needs. Jeff was professional in his dealings with us and above and beyond to get us back on the road. He struck us as an honest person to do business with. Getting harder and harder to find that. Thank you Jeff and staff.< /Review>

Jeff sealed the automatic transmission of my 65 Mercedes 220 SEb perfectly. Always feel that my vehicle is in good hands at Lemon Grove Transmission. Thank you Jeff, I highly recommend your shop, also conveniently located very close to a Trolley Stop!</text>

These guys are always so courteous, patient, nice, affordable, honest and fast. I never have to feel like I am being taken advantage of because Jeff is so nice and honest. You can tell that they care about the customers and the service they preform over making a ton of money.<//Review>

< Review>
This is my go to mechanic shop, they do great and honest work. One time I went to a different mechanic due to them being within walking distance of my house and that was a huge mistake the guy just fixed some random thing despite me telling him my coolant was leaking. A few days later my coolant started leaking again! I took my car across town to Lemon Gorve Transmission and they found the leak asap. Will never go to another place again, my loyalty is to lemon grove transmission.< /Review>

I know my truck and car are in good hands.  Lemon Grove Transmission is the trusted name in auto maintenance.  They were able to fix things the dealership couldn't.  I will always take my vehicles here.</Text>

Great service! Great people. These guys are the only place I take my Tacoma for service. They do so much more than just transmissions. They never try and upsell me with something i don't need. One of the few honest places to take your car.</Review>

<text>Other than terrible parking, they replaced my transmission pretty quickly and did a check up at about 1600 miles. I feel like it was a bit over priced. But it did come with a 3yr/100,000 mile warranty.< /text>< Pics>

Took my 2010 Ford Ranger in to replace the driveshaft. They were extremely quick. They did an excellent job. They wrote me a letter informing me of other maintenance tips I'd might want to address. Very professional technician I spoke to, but don't currently have his name. I would highly recommend this location to anyone. They were very honest and straight to the point.< /Review>

Jeff + Lemon Grove Transmission are the best. I’ve had the worst luck with mechanics the last few years and Jeff came highly recommended to me by my landlord who’s been going to Jeff for years. I am so happy I took his recommendation because I’ve had the best experience with Jeff. Very honest, very fair in pricing, never does work that’s not needed, and my 4Runner is running smoother than it has in a while. Thank you :-)</Review>

Honest. Fair. Friendly. They do good work in a timely manner and stand behind it! Willing to explain what the problem is not just rush ahead to the cash register. All of these things are hard to find in a business these days. That makes them stand out all the more!< /review>

<review>Took my 2007 Hyundi Tuson in and spoke with Jeff and told him that the Find Auto computer was saying that the transmission had issues. We had taken the car to another place and they said that you need a new transmission, They replaced the fluid and we were having the same problems. Jeff at Lemon Grove Transmission took it in, he replaced the fluid with the correct fluid. And now my car is shifting better and no issues on the Fixd computer green lights across the board. Thank you Jeff and the crew at Lemon Grove Transmission for treating me like a customer, and not trying to rip me off.
Again thank you Lemon Grove Transmission 🤩🤩🤩🤩</review>< Pictures>

They are good on keeping their records - it would be easier if it was input into a system so it can be easier to search. I look forward to coming here for a future transmission.< /review>

Jeff and his crew kept my 2000 Dodge minivan running safely for over 10 years. When it finally died the last time, he called to let me know what the problem was and promptly told me he wasn't going to fix it. He said it would cost me more than it was worth to fix and I should use the money to buy something newer and more reliable. When I got my new (to me) car I took it straight to him to give it a once over. He told me I'd made a great choice and congratulated me on the purchase. I won't be going as often anymore, but I will only be going back to Lemon Grove Transmission. Jeff is honest and does great work. I won't take my car to anyone else.< /Text>

Awesome spot. I order a couple of Steak n Shrimp tacos and they were ready in less than 10 minutes. Very filling (lots of meat) and delicious with avocado, cabbage, onions, cilantro and sauce! Came with a large side of chips and salsa, good deal. I recommend this spot for taco cravings and I will return.<//text>

< Review>
I came here today for my birthday dinner since I wanted to try a new place and I has been waiting to try the food here. I tried to online through the website but it said it wasn't accepting any orders so I called them instead. They said they are open for phone orders but I asked if I could place my order through yelp and they said yes. So I got the Turf Burrito with Carne Asasa Steak with no rice or beans and I asked for extra tomato and cilantro. My food was ready within like 15 minutes compared to yelp telling me it would he ready in 20-40 minutes. I thought their burritos was very good, all that was missing for me was some pico de gallo and hot sauces. I think they want you to basically use the sauce that comes with the burrito which is their Chipotle Sauce. I wasn't sure if I had to ask for pico de gallo or hot sauce when I pick up my order but I'll try next time.</Review>

Had the surf n turf burrito, it was good and would get it again but maybe less baja sauce would bring out more of the steak n shrimp flavor.  The guacamole with chips was very good!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtt5bx-Dq4W_A57wTQTFQyLT0UL1EjGm2Tykru=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKRJAklE3qMGcsii9E1gUfTquTo2e9CTgEwE7z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My Son has eaten here several times and really likes it. Me? I'm a picky eater. You know how there are taco places you go and can't seem to find it all under one roof?? Here, you can! The tacos are good, the salsa's are good, the guacamole is good. The chips are good! Like, even the service too?? YES!! I'd recommend you try it at least once. I'm a huge supporter of small/family owned business.  Stop in and say hello to Andy! Super nice guy.</Review>< rating>

I showed up at a very slow 1pm for lunch. Never been here before so i always go to a new place with an open mind.

Fish Tacos: the meat was overcooked, and there was just way too much cabbage/slaw. No fish flavor at all.

Asada Tacos: The meat should have a very simple savory flavor and the condiments should do the talking. I feel like meat was over spiced, which in turn changed the flavor of the salsa. Just not my cup of tea.

I don't think the owners really focused on creating a good flavor spectrum. They should really consider hiring a cook that really knows Mexican food.

I don't want this to be a hate post, or a negative feedback. Hopefully it is seen as constructive criticism.</Text>

<Text>The service here is great and is the only reason why it gets a three star rating. The tacos are really expensive but the size matches it's price. The fish tacos are just ok. It was pretty bland taste wise. But the cashier was very polite and attentive. He knew the menu and was able to advise me on what to get. First time trying this place but the food doesn't make me want to go back for more.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Stumbled upon this tiny taco joint while driving up the street. Andy (the owner) was outside & greeted us with a huge smile. We ordered the steak & shrimp tacos and chicken turf torta. Both were delicious! The tacos were equal parts citrusy, tangy & sweet and the cabbage slaw gave it the perfect crunch with each bite. This is a great neighborhood taco joint to support with the best customer service and even better food!<//review><time>1594779040797<//time><Rate>5< /Rate><user_id>116859689308987739707</user_id>< GmapID>

Love this place! End up here basically every week since it's close by to where my wife gets her allergy shots. Has the best breakfast burritos at a reasonable price. Love to bug the owner about not having coffee but he is working on it. Was even willing to help out when my car wouldn't start after we had ordered. Just a great place and great service.<//review>

I went that place to send a sea cargo at ATLAS cargo but the lady tell me that if I use card she will charge 10 percent so I went to nearest bank and get cash. at ATM machine headed back to store I had 2 100 dollar bills 1 is new green and 1 is gray old one and you know what she refuse to accept the old dollar. that's disgusting.< /Review>

It looks like family own super tasty i got two carne asada tacos, the other got a quesadilla and a burrito the spicy it's a flavoured not impossible to eat as other places. We really enjoyed the food.

Customer service was great, they even check on us if we needed more sauce or chips. Def. Coming back. 👍</review>

This place is amazing. The old place before they opened up was garbage but God Damn! This place has some of the best food I've ever tasted. The tacos are heavenly and the burritos are to die for. I highly recommend!!</Text>

<review>I wanted to order a burrito in a combo (a combo includes rice and beans for $3). My burrito was about $8, so with the rice and beans, my total was about $11. I got my burrito and waited for the rice and beans, which didn't come. They ended up charging me an extra $3 because they said they hadn't charged me for it before. Should've kept my receipt. Wish I could give them 0 stars for cheating me out of my money.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c29a8ef8727a37:0x1a0a023ce490a696< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Four tacos for 15 dollars and the tortillas aren’t made by hand smh you want real tacos go to a real Mexican taco shop!  Not all taco shops have mini tacos by the way and this is not gourmet especially using that brand of tortillas   You over price your “ gourmet tacos “ I know what I’m talking about though<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Derrick and his team safely got an AC unit up four stories to the roof of a Victorian to connect with my central furnace in the attic.  There were electrical poles and wires on the front sidewalk, had to be lifted to the roof from the back stairs two stories down - it was crazy and they did it!  It took more than expected, they honored their price even with five technicians in order to get it up to the roof - amazing!
I can't recommend them highly enough - I will use them for everything HVAC!</Text>

Very bad service. Two technician comes twice with two different conclusion. One time comes says Freon is low. Second time comes says compressor is sometime working, sometime not. Can not add Freon. This is like fraud to me. Will not recommend this company to any one.<//Text>

Worst Ever!! Called for service mid-December 2018 (pilot flame not igniting), Tech arrives, examines and resolves issue, suggesting next servicing we install an additional $125 part, which he just happen to have. Taking his advice, we asked him to install it then, which he did in 5 minutes, total bill $225; though not certain what part was replaced (wasn't listed on the receipt nor did we get the old part back). Christmas Eve at 5p, furnace ceases working again, same as before. Immediately reached out to this 24/7 entity, our call went straight to voicemail, no response. Horribly inconvenient, expensive as quests has to be rehoused. Day after Christmas, the same tech returns and, after several fumbles (all the while on his phone), tells us he'll want an additional $300 to resolve, still no mention of the previously replaced part. Not satisfied with his cavalier, inept demeanor, we declined his offer, then contacted the office dispatcher who apologetically advised he was actually a trainee, that there wasn't record of the any previously installed part and that she would instead send one of her experienced techs to resolve the issue @ 1p that day; a total no show, we finally received a call @ 3:30p asking if we still wanted service. Our confidence obliterated, we choose to pass, absorbing the financial loss and all the frustration that went with it before it became worse, my leaving this review 2 years later after reading the recent ones. These poor reviews aren't fake. From the money grab to lack of a proper receipt (with part) or just showing up on time, NEVER EVER AGAIN WOULD WE USE SAME DAY!!<//Review>

I had a great experience by Same Day Air Conditioning people.  I had them do my maintenance on the heating system and then they helped me with the air flow issue I was having.  I was getting less air in some rooms and more air in other rooms.  The installed dampers to improve the flow.  Overall great and quick service.  I would highly recommend using them.< /Review>

Hashem, from Same Day Air Conditioning and Heating came to fix our heather that was broken. He was here within the time allocated to us. Hashem, was able to figure out the issue within a few minutes and explained the issue to us. The matter was fixed within a couple of minutes. We are very happy with his service and his professionalism. Over all a great experience and would highly recommend this technician and Company.< /Review>

<userid>104955423458355042104<//userid><review>This company was assigned by AHS, home warranty company.
They came and were unable to fix issue. I understand that. They caused another issue due to allowing air in the gas lines to the water heater. I had to have another company fix it.
I called them with no return call for over a week. I also left emails so reply.
I asked for reimbursement and they said they would send check. Never got it. I left a negative review and they called and stated they would not send a check unless I removed review.
Pretty bad service.
I still never got check. I emailed again and they stated again that they were bending over backwards and that it wasn’t their technician fault EVEN after I showed them written PROOF it was.
This company is unprofessional, unethical in their business practice and unwilling to learn from their mistakes.
Don’t use them unless you want a severe headache.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>My experience with SAME DAY HEATING & AIR was a pure nightmare. I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just start from the beginning. I called Same Day Air for a simple new air conditioning unit & installation, they gave me an appointment for 3 weeks out then the day before the appointment they changed it for an additional week out. Fast forward to the date of service the technician installed the new unit outside and he had to go into the attic to install some other equipment. While he was in the attic because of his negligence he kicked the emergency fire sprinkler system pipes loose an did not say anything to me about this crucial mistake. He just left saying everything was fixed. It was not until I went into my laundry room several hour later that I discovered this because the water was pouring from my ceiling. I immediately tried to contact them which was extremely difficult but when I did it took them until 9:30 at night to get there & then they had to outsource the repairs to a different company who was not done with the repairs until 3:00 in the morning. Okay... Now a month later the air conditioning has completely stopped working. This is the worst air conditioning repair company that I have everything encountered. I'm warning you DO NOT use this company!!!!!!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Sanad was great! Rarely do I give a 5 star review, but the company was very responsive and, as I said, Sanad was great. I usually work on my own appliances, but I hadn't worked with this HVAC system. Sanad found that I actually have a 2-stage system that was connected incorrectly. This was done by the previous company that installed the unit. He was able to correct it and it is working now as expected.
Thanks Sanad!< /Text>

<review>Called American Home Shield because furnace was not heating.  Furnace was connected to older AC.  Same day said my furnace was leaking carbon monoxide and should be replaced.  I told them to disconnect furnace.  Same day said I should not install a new furnace to connect to old AC unit and that I should replace both.  I agreed to do this.  Same day installed both and charged me $6700.  (October 2019)  I still have not received any warranty or paper work for furnace or AC.  Charged for obtaining permit and AT24 inspection from city but no notice about merit was given to me and city has not come to inspect.  American home shield said I should be out of pocket $3,375 but I am out of pocket $6700.  Have been trying to solve this for almost a year.  In the meantime, the new AC went out and American Home Shield sent another company who said, Same day had not changed copper pipe linking outside unit to inside unit, causing ice to build up.  This happened during the heat spell when I was, and still am, sheltering in space due to cover.  I hope to get this resolved before I have to take more drastic action.  Still trying to obtain Same day contractors license number.</review>< pics>

<review>Connected with them via American Home Shield home warranty. We decided to cancel the service call but we've tried 6 times and no responses from them. They don't respond to replies to their emails and texts. Their phone just rings busy every time we try to call. For all we know, they're going to show up and we just won't be home but we've tried 6 times to reach them and nothing.</review>< pictures>

<review>We called a maintenance service to our Carrier AC unit. The crew of 2 spoke foreign language, almost "in secret" whispering to each other, without explaining what they are doing.  Only upon inquiry they mentioned that coolant is low, and will be refilled. But they never gave us any confidence how much was refilled. The bill was outright shocking: $90 per quart, totaling to $300 and we have no idea how much of the gold-priced liquid was really filled in.  My wife works with our vendors of the home owners association, and they told that the coolant costs approx. $30 per quart, thus we re charged 300% as it seems. I definitely would not recommend such company.<//review>< Gmap_id>

First impression, was questionable. They Diagnosed the issue. Waited 2 weeks, in the middle of summer. Replaced the outside condensing unit, put in a new electrical whip, and disconnect. I was impressed. I work in the trade but wanted to use my home warranty. I was pleased we with their work. I would use them again and again< /text>

Do not use this company, they will steal your money. Gave Same Day $137 for an estimated $1200 job. It's been 2 week and still not received any service. Called the company several times and no one has returned my call. I called the technician Abe who assured me he would schedule time. No service, no response and no refund. Try another company.<//review>

I was forced to have this company check my air conditioning unit by American Home Shield.  I was given a 1:30-5:30 window for the "technician". He showed up at 5 :35!  He came in, took some pictures of my A/C unit and left. For THAT, I paid $75!!  Never a follow up as to the diagnosis.  The tech asked me to make sure I have this company a good review.  Really?!  I am considering dropping this warranty company if they ever mention this band of thieves again.  I paid over $400 out of pocket to fix my unit since Same Day did nothing.  Will also lost on Yelp<//review>

Can you give a zero?  These liars came to our home without setting up an appointment, then lied to our home warranty company by saying that they visited our home.  No one was home.  And it's the 2nd time they pulled this.  DO NOT USE THEM.< /Review>

I will certainly recommend Same Day Air Conditioning & Heating to all my friends. Their techicians know exactly how to solve problems correctly, without guessing. My previous heating company techician was guessing, and tried to sell me a thermostad unnecessarily, which I declined of course. I give Same Day Air Conditioning & Heating a 5 stars rating.</Text>

They have some type of scam going with American Home Shield. Supposedly to replace a furnace only cost 573.00 parts and labor and disposal -- it's what Home Shield pays them and I'd have to pay 2800.00 for permits and flutes and plates...

A kid from Same Day came out to make a report on the work needed and said he didn't know if I had asbestos or not. And that I needed to contact an asbestos abatement company which was gonna charge me 1400 bucks! Sears came for an estimate, took one look at my furnace and told me he was glad I didn't have asbestos!

Do NOT use them!<//Text>

If there were a zero star category, I would give it to them.  The reasons are as follows:
- unprofessional manners and lying to customer.
- they provide extremetry bad service as they send all incompetent technicians to your house.
- the technician spent  only 6 minutes and
Came back knocking on my door telling me the problem was fixed.  I knew they lied to me
And I asked them what you fixed.  He just picked out something from his car and told me that waswhat he replaced so this was originally from your air conditioning unit.  I looked at the board and knew immediately it was not the original part because it looked so clean and the color was also different.
When I questioned him he got very mad and said  “ do you think I lie to you? do you want your problem fixed?  I already fixed your problem”.  And he went on And on.  I had to tell him that “I am not arguing with you and I will just talk to the insurance company”.

-My original problem is the unit shuts off
Automatically after 15- 20 minutes running.
Guess what happened ?   when his car just pulled off my complex and the unit shut off
On its own.</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>They came out 3-4 times to my tenants house after the AC stop blowing cold air. They never where able to properly diagnose the problem or fix it. Last visit the HVAC completely stopped working when I asked the technicians what happens they couldn’t give me a straight answer. From not blowing cold air to a completely broken unit? This is not right. They also, broke about 15 pieces of roof tile. Still waiting for manager to find a solution to fix the broken roof tile. My tenant witness them carelessly getting on the roof and breaking the tile.I do not recommend!< /Review><GmapID>0x808f9695574fc101:0x4ce10a7d51291edf<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
So I called this company about two months ago to assist with a service request on my air conditioner. The dispatcher had the correct address but the driver/worker went to the wrong address. I had to call after they missed the appt window that they had scheduled me for, when I called I was told that they could no longer come out same day due to traffic and that I would need to call the office again and setup a new appt. I was irritated but i own a business myself and decide to give them a second chance. Rescheduled and still not tech came to assist. To make matters worse two months later (today to be exact) I received a text asking for me to leave feedback. Smh this is not a business that I ever see myself calling in the future.<//review>

Jorge was great! I had somehow locked my SIM card and was unable to access the AT&T network. After trying my local AT&T store only to find they were closed before their online hours stated, I drove 45 minutes to Fresno in hopes I could get my issue fixed. Jorge helped me at the River Park store and had my phone up and running again in no time! Thank you so much!< /Text>

Recently purchased new phone.  ATT rep, Marcus, was outstanding.  His product knowledge was superb and made recommendations based on what I was wanting.  Exceptional service.  Would highly recommend this particular store and Marcus in particular.<//text>

This branch has the worst customer service. I went there , the guy who I talked to was actually not interested to help me he didn't even greet me when I went there. A woman working there was so loud I couldn't even hear what the guy was telling me when I told him I will leave because she is so loud he didn't even apologize out of courtesy or at least talking to her to put her volume down so he would be able to help me.</text>

It was 10 minutes before closing time, 2 employees sitting in the store with the door locked and would not let us and other customers in. Very dissatisfied with this poor representation of the company. Will not come to this store next time because of all the buffoonery</Review>

<text>The people there we're very patient and helpful, they helped me fix something wrong with my phone and it works amazingly now. A lady there helped us for about an hour and never rushed or got annoyed with us or our problem, she was very kind and again, helpful. I plan to go there anytime I have an issue with my phone that I can't seem to fix it on my own. I recommend this place 100% and thank you so much to the lady that helped us today.< /text>< pics>

Sales person screwed up the data transfer on my phone, sending everything BUT the pictures. As if that wasn't a big enough screw up they somehow deleted all the pictures off the iCloud as well. 4+years of memories all gone thanks to the incompetence of this staff. I live an hour from the store so its not lie I can just pop in. Tried AT&T customer service, they can't help. Heck I even tried calling another store down the street. But they said this store doesn't share communication with the others. It's an absolute JOKE that I call for hours on end, over the course of multiple DAYS and cant get a person from this store on the phone. Totally unprofessional. I'll never spend another dime in this store, and I'll warn everyone I know to avoid this place like the plague! GARBAGE BUSINESS!!< /Review>< pictures>

My wife walked in to the store for a new phone, bc her phone was cracked beyond repair. Lisa helped her, got her an iPhone XR. Now my wife still owed substantial amount on her old phone. Lisa told her we can accelerate the payment, lisa said "we do it all the time". Lisa call att to get the deal done.  My wife kept asking can I make payments she said yes. Lisa also said call customers support to set up payments. And now we find out that's not true. Now we owe everything up front. We were told by another att store there were other options to help us solve this issue. Lisa told us there are no options....... we are forced to file a complaint with corporate regarding this issue.
We will never come back to this store bc of the misleading information by LIsa<//Review>< pictures>

Discontinued their cell phone repairs at this location. Once the sales reps know that you  are there due to problems with your phone & not interested in purchasing new phones or accessories, they are DONE with you & ignore you. You're better off going to Best Buy cell phone center where the prices AND customer service is much better!</review>

Incorrect! Called Blackstone store, they had both, 6s and 7s in a variety of capacity. My husband decided to just go with 8, since he was already there. They sold him premium protection plan saying it’s automated and not an option and we can cancel in a month. Incorrect! Called AT&T customer service, IT IS an option and had never been an automated feature. The customer service removed it. My husband came home, phone doesn’t work, something about SIM card, went back, they fixed it. Left, phone will not sinc, went back for them to fix it. I never have any type of issues at the Blackstone location!<//Review>< Rate>

The employees let me wait to add a new line which caused me to be there past closing. They were talkative, helpful and accommodating. The two customers inside with me were friendly and talkative too. Made a late night enjoyable. Thanks Att Riverpark</Text>

The lack of customer service was dissapointing. I understand employees cannot aid to every customer right away, but to completely ignore their existence is disgusting!!! To top it off the store wasn’t even busy. Both staff members looked at me then looked away. I waited out a good 10 minutes to see if they would even acknowledge my presence... NOPE.< /Review>

So I went here a couple weeks ago to get a new iPhone via the BOGO deal. Lisa told me I could get around the issues of having to add another line by cancelling one of my current lines. Well she was right about that, but wrong about SO much else. Basically, my bill increased nearly $150 because she didn't take the time to really look into my account and realize that the plan I had was actually an older unlimited data plan where the 4th line on my account was free (which was my line and I didn't realize it). When I cancelled my line it MESSED up the entire bill. AND she failed to mention the fact that I have to pay installments on my phone for 3 months before I can pay if outright online, which is what I wanted to do. So in short, I got screwed, I hope you don't.</review>

Had a very sour experience here at this AT&T Authorized Retailer store, save yourself costly complications and just go down the street to the Corporate store.
My boyfriend surprised me with a brand new iPhone 5C from this store, when I had opened it I was very happy, but the back was full of abrasions in the gloss as if it had been used.  I asked if it was refurbished and he said no.  We set out to exchange it for a new one in brand new condition.  After calling, we were told we wouldn't be able to return it and need to go to the Apple Store.  After speaking to Apple Store manager he told us this Parrot store is responsible for selling defected product.  Long story short, through the help of AT&T corporate we were able to get a new iPhone 5C without a restocking fee.

This Parrot store is only an Authorized Retailer, they sent us through the ringer!  On top of a restocking fee of $35, we wouldn't be able to get an iPhone of "the same size and color". The manager, Justin was very unhelpful and was not available to talk to corporate to answer questions while we had them on the phone.  He was thoroughly engaged helping another customer, I understand that, but he should have delegated the work.  He should have sent one of the many other employees to take over the product set up with the other customer, and handled managerial duties with us when corporate needed answers.  Most importantly, the service team at this store gave up on helping us with this product issue.  We had to contact corp. on our own accord, this store offered no alternative resolution or phone number to seek help.

Just a customer that believes when buying a new product, you should receive a NEW product.  Not a scratched up one...  My bf went through the trouble to surprise me with a brand new phone, not a refurbished one, so that's what I wanted from this store.  We won't be returning.

Thanks to AT&T Corporate down the street, everything was fixed and I walked away with a brand new shiny iPhone as we paid for and expected.  Skip the hassle with this Authorized Retailer store and go down the street to Corporate.  They help you out much faster and have the means to solve any issues, should they arise.<//review>

This location is a joke. Kristina signed me up for Direct TV and internet and the price quoted is not on the agreement. She said she would call and have the promotion entered correctly, but I'm still left without confirmation and she doesn't know what else to do.

On several occasions that I've said I would come in, I've been told the manager is the only person who can help me; however he is never there.

I signed November 5th, installer came the first time on the 11th but left because Kristina did not have my phone number released. On the 17th of November she finally figured out how to obtain the number and had another installer set to come on the 22nd. As I paid for wireless boxes the lady told me my monthly payment which was STILL not correct. I called Kristina and she said she would call... She tells me it's Direct TV and they have to have the request approved but I WILL see the adjustments and should get an email.. still no email. So now, I had the cable installed of course and can't get anyone to assist me with the adjustment.

I went in person Saturday November 25th because I didn't get any email and Kristina just said "sorry" and she didn't know what else to do. I go to try and speak to the manager and he isn't there. SHOCKER!

This punk Amr gave me some BS when I walked in that Brytt the manager was running errands from store to store and they didn't know when he would be back. Kristina offered to call him and find out how long he would be. She stepped into the little side office for about 5 minutes and then came out and said Brytt would be 30-40 minutes... he was having car trouble and was trying to get his wife's car. (Different story but ok). I decided to wait for him. Throughout my 50 minutes wait I call another location to see if they could help me, but as much as they were willing, they are not able to and said Brytt is the person to speak to.

I end up walking back in from a phone call and Kristina said he would be another 20 minutes. I then ask who is above Brytt that I can speak to and they all said Dale. I ask for Dales contact info and Amr smarted off saying Dale isn't working and they all agreed they cannot give out his info. Then Amr told me Brytt is having personal issues and they don't know when he'll be back. I told all 3 workers that I am the customer who has the issue. How am I supposed to resolve this then? If I continue letting each day pass, it'll be harder for me to cancel this overpriced under-delivered garbage. Amr says "I hate to rain on your parade but that's not our issue. It's your issue and Brytt is dealing with some stuff so that's it."

Other conversation takes place, I show another girl I think Ariana (not sure) and she even said the cable was not right and Kristina needs to call. Kristina said she has and doesn't know what happened. STILL NO BRYTT! I ask again how I can get into contact with who is above Brytt and they all said they can't give it out and it's Saturday so they wouldn't be able to help me.

I step out and call another store who kindly provided me with contact info. I walked back in and told them to let Brytt know I will reach out to Dale and go from there. Amr let out a loud "Ahhh!" As I walked out.

I ended up getting a text and a call from Kristina while I was reaching out to Dale, and she said Brytt was back. Convenient right? After I already spent over an hour! Brytt never reached out to me or anything any point to try and fix this.

Not to mention Brytt was having his workers lie to me and cover for him, which as a manager that's shameful!

As for Amr, your disrespect was what people secretly record and post on social media. I don't know where you got this idea that it's ok to flat out lie to people (being present all 4 times she's called? OOOK) and make rude comments but you'll always need to work in places with careless managers like Brytt in order to get away with that non-sense.

I'm still here stuck with my issues. It's been one business day and I have not heard from Dale yet, but I will try again tomorrow.<//Review>

Bought a brand new iPhone 5c with a renewal 2 year contract at this at&t store, after opening the case found out it was used (light scratches and scuffs). Returned to the store 1 day later to complain and asked for an exchange (same phone only new). Justine the store manager was no help and told me it was a problem that had to be dealt with at the apple store. Called the apple store (Fashion Fair) and spoke to Seth and learned the apple store only deals with device defects and not damage. Long story short, between at&t corporate and the apple store which I had to call on my own personal phone, I ended up returning the damaged iPhone5c at a cost of 35$ (restocking fee), Justin the manager said there was no way around this. and got a full refund minus the restocking fee. Went to the at&t corporate office down the street at herndon and blackstone. Not only did they apologize but gave me back the $35 as a credit on my bill and gave me a brand new iphone5c. I will be also filing a complaint with at&t corporate. total waste of my morning for something that was a no brainier.

They even refused to give me another iPhone 5c after my refund because it would be considered a exchange one employee said

bottom line, this store is only a vending machine, the minute you have a complaint or concern they make you feel like your at fault. Lesson learned only deal with at&t corporate offices or the apple store and stay away from authorized dealers like this one.< /Text>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I used to order from this place all the time. Uber Eats mainly, and my go to order was the bourbon bacon burger with seasoned fries and a strawberry milkshake.

Well, recently I've been ordering breakfast menu items, but this Denny's store, this particular one never ceases to amaze me. Now I'm not saying that they're perfect, but pretty damn close.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>I hate to leave a poor review but although modern Denny's are decent and fairly reliable, skip the one on El Cajon Bl. The service is lacking, but worse the food was several notches under par in almost every way. Edible, but not well prepared. Toast was dry and stale, sausage burned on one side not even brown on the other. The eggs were decent. Hash browns boring and slightly undercooked to my taste but acceptable. This was not the Denny's brand breakfast I've come to expect from other Denny's. My daughters sandwich looked awful and not fresh. We had to wait too long to order, despite the waitress coming to our table to inform us that she couldn't take our order, twice.  And the food took a long time to get there despite not being terribly busy. Anybody can have a bad day but Ive been there before and now vow to never go back to that location.  Denny's is great, but skip this one unless your a gambler. They don't have good food and the server we had didn't seem interested in her job. My daughter thought she was rude. Not sure Id go that far. Just apathetic. Databyter</Review><Rate>2<//Rate></record>

<Text>Fast service cute and small. Only issue was the front waiting sits where missing there cushions might be for people not to sit or something happen. Took my mom to her fav place for her after dialysis stuff. But please don't forget others who need to sit like disabled people.< /Text>< username>

Food portion was relatively small and the server picked up condiments me and my wife had asked for from another table that was occupied when we arrived and placed them on our table without sanitizing them. Luckily my wife took notice and sanitized them with our Keychain sanitizer. Will not be coming back.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Denny's has pretty good diner food. During covid, they have a wait list for seating in/outdoors. Their out door seating is all very close (I'd say closer than when eating inside.) So, if that bothers you make sure you say something to be seated accordingly. They are doing well during covid to keep guests comfortable and happy.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

A great place to get breakfast. It was popular and the service was great! Had a nice outside tent seating that protected us from the rain as well. Recommended.<//Text>

<Text>This is by far my best experience at a denny's. This denny's was clean and quick. I had the lumberjack breakfast with am extra egg all cooked perfectly and great tasting. I also had ybete green smoothie, which was refreshing.their tres leeches pancakes were sooo good!! It is an awesome idea!Manager was walking around making sure all coffees were filled and greeting guest! And you can't beat these prices plus there coupons in the mail! Which I used saved me $7!<//Text>< response>

<text>My new favorite Pitstop While I Work Uber. Nobody else will allow me to use the restroom so these guys get my vote. They don't care if I order something to go or to stay, they are always Pleasant, clean and the restroom is available. Thank you so very much Denny's. You make my life so much easier while I'm out on the road at hours at a time. God bless.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This is an older Denny's we had never been to. Plenty of parking and really great service. When we ordered we weren't very hungry and I just sort of mentioned my wife and I would be sharing what we ordered. We received the food with plates of food for my wife and plates of food for me. I thought we had double ordered. The kind woman said she over heard what I said so she brought the order already, perfectly divided, and boy was it delicious 💞.< /review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Great food and fast service. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. A good choice for any meal!

A family environment that caters well to both children and seniors.  There is definitely something for everyone.

Once you have made a decision you might regret your decision because there are so many good things to choose from making it difficult to decide.

I would come here again and again knowing that I will not be disappointed as the food is served extremely consistently.

I am looking forward to the next time I come to eat here!</text>< Pictures>

The food is good, but I can’t stop thinking about the amount of flies I’ve seen. And the food took forever to come out. And plus while sitting next to the window I realized there were 3 dead flies and 2 about to die.< /Text>

<Text>Our table was on an incline due to the uneven street. Couldn't eat comfortably due to the fact that my chair that was leaning back. Food was solid. Sevice was decent but my group had to wait till we got the check to get any napkins. Not the best experience but then again maybe thats what I get for wearing a LA DODGERS CHAMPIONSHIP Hat in San Diego.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Not thrilled about the restricted menu, but it was actually pretty pleasant sitting outside - makes me appreciate the beautiful San Diego weather all the more.
The service was good, and so was the food.< /review>

Service was great here even when I ordered from postmates and my order was messed up the server on duty went above and beyond in making sure it got corrected and even gave me some extra goodies for the inconvienance and I left happy with how the mistake was made right and handled.

The service is too slow. The hash browns are too raw. Hash browns are supposed to be crunchy not just crunchy on top and raw through out the rest of it! Eeww! They can't get your order right to save their lives. I ordered a burger once and they brought me a veggie burger. I found out the hard way by bitting into it. Gross! Then they still couldn't get it right. They forgot the cheese then they forgot my tomato. My goodness. By the time they got it together my friend was already done eating. You know how hard it is to watch someone eat while you wait for them to get your order right and your hungry. I only go now because that's where my friend likes to go but if I had my choice I'd choose somewhere else entirely. If you can, don't go to Denny's. They really stink.</Text>

The food was warm. While everyone else's food comes with Steam coming off the Meal. The Crepe was like leather. It was wet with syrup and I, still couldn't cut it with a fork without etching the plate. Not enough Syrup options. Food presentation was 👎. Looks like the Cook was in a rush.  ☕ costs $2.69 a cup. But I only received barely half of a cup of  ☕.  $23.89 for 2 people. The Men's bathroom 🚻 was wet, ice cold and had water dripping from lights in the ceiling. If you sit on the 🚽 you better have a jacket on. And something to keep your butt cheeks from getting frostbite.</Text>

My kids and I like breakfast at Denny's, and we've tried all of them in our area.  This one is the best.  It's small and cozy, and the service is prompt and courteous.  There's a nice neighborhood vibe, fresh hot coffee, and tasty hashbrowns.  What more can you want?<//Text>

The food was extremely well packaged and the employees were very polite. All of the food was still hot, we had a bag of condiments as well. Good service.< /review>

Unfortunately our Denny's in Encinitas closed and we miss it. We were in North Park and decided to go to this Denny's. Elizabeth our waitress did not dissapoint. She was friendly, courteous and very attentive. We enjoyed our steak and eggs very much. Awesome meal and kudos to Elizabeth. Thank you!< /Text>

Not my favorite Denny's! Food & price always spot on, but mgr needs to watch his front door, for people sneaking into bathrooms. Disgusting! No longer feel safe here!  Sorry<//review>

<Text>Ok first of all, I went out of my way to take the last trolley over to that area because when I did a google search for restaurants who accept EBT this specific address came up as the closest Denny's to me that was open at that time of night. Then, come to find out I put myself through some ridiculous struggle over nothing since this establishment apparently never accepted EBT, and after the fact that all I did was let whoever was working right then and there know about the false advertising about them online, they felt like they needed to waste my hard earned cash just a little more by selling me pancakes burnt to a crisp that also tasted as if it were cooked in a pan that hadn't been cleaned from the night before. Simply, I am just seriously unimpressed.< /Text><response>None<//response>< rate>

Very small location, but frankly that adds to the charm of an old world diner. Staff were friendly and service was fast and efficient. For a Denny's you can't go wrong at this location.<//Text>

No hi welcome to Denny’s like other customers received. I stood at front the two workers didn’t say anything. They looked at me but didn’t even say hi LOL WOW. Than one finally says you can have a seat there and I said no I rather sit on that side she said that’s fine. I asked for water they bring me the water with a fly in it. I immediately saw it, so if I can see idk why they couldn’t before bringing it to me. I was staring at the water the fly was at the top as soon as she set it down she noticed that I was staring at it but couldn’t figure out why I’m saying to myself you don’t see it?? but I said thank you anyway. But I’m like just gross. There were also two flys flying around our table and my daughter who just turned 4 that’s why we were there it’s her birthday said mommy behind you loud kept talking about the flys. I eventually asked for another water I said there’s a fly in it. You know cuz it’s always awkward for the worker to hear that so I made it seem like it just landed in it since we had flys already flying around us which she doesn’t know that probably but no it really actually came from wherever they fill the drinks. So that’s disgusting that they have flys everywhere and I’m afraid for my food. Who knows what they have in the back. So that place had a lot of flys. Than the food came, didn’t even separate mine from my daughters. She asked after if you want a separate plate it’s like no duh ! But I said I’ll just use the saucer you put the ranch in. So she doesn’t have to do extra work. I was really a decent customer who didn’t complain about ANYTHING when I had a right too. I understand being a server is hard. However I’m a customer a PAYING customer and I deserve decent service and food quality in return. So the last hope of this birthday meal for my daughter was the food. They didn’t have any drinks I asked for, Shirley temple they are out. Mango or strawberry banana smoothie they are out for my daughter I’m like well what do you have my Jesus. Come to find out they had the smoothie I’m like oh wow the unsure run around. My daughter wanted strawberry banana one. It was overly sweet. So the food finally came was disappointed as well. It was so disgusting. Even the ranch tasted thin and like salad dressing not dipping ranch. WHICH I had many times at Denny’s including this location and it was always thick and creamy and consistent. Also the sausage links say ON THE MENU 4 my daughters plate only had 2. I was laughing inside at that point. This was such a disaster. I don’t know what happened with Denny’s or if it’s just this location but it wasn’t the same. The experience was bad, the environment was bad with the flys flying around us and actually being in my water that they brought me THAT THEY DIDNT EVEN SEE that’s so embarrassing I would be embarrassed as a worker, and the food was bad. I still paid for the meals and gave a tip. I’m not gonna make the working man or woman have a hard time I understand they’re stressed but at the same time I should be respected. And the fact they didn’t even say hi welcome to Denny’s from the start and the whole experience ended up being gross. A little goes a long way. It just wasn’t there. Like I said, I’m not gonna be a “ “Karen” customer I will still tip, I just won’t be back. I may try other Denny’s in future but not that one. The decor is outdated just stale the flys and the customer service like they don’t want to be there and the food idk if it’s simply just the chef who don’t know flavor and how to cook or the corporation changing everything and getting rid of certain drinks. Either way that experience was so gross and bothersome. Just simply won’t be back to this particular location. I love Denny’s as it is a classic restaurant been going to since I was a kid. But this particular location no thanx. Maybe years from now with new management, servers, chefs and staff but not any time soon.<//review>

<Review>Stopped in here after taking my wife to the airport for a pre-rush breakfast. Been to a lot of Denny's, even one with a bar in Bakersfield. This spot has got that clean, classic diner feel that you only see in movies. Quick service, not stingy on the coffee refills. Got the lumberjack slam that morning. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was sourdough toast was chewy-er than I expected.</Review>< Pics>

Don’t waste your time here. Bad customer service. First time in San Diego and they told us we had to wait outside. When we went outside they told us we couldn’t sit down. They took forever to bring us our food and then forgot to give us napkins and straws.< /review>

<review>Quiet and relaxing. I ate the fish n chips.  They have the best French Fries here but sometimes they under cook them.  The new Fish product is a great addition to the menu but when it is allowed to thaw out it cooks up dark dark almost black in color product and tastes burnt. When the product is cooked from a frozen state it comes out golden brown and the taste is perfect. The service is hit and miss depends on the time of day. Overall it's a decent place to eat.<//review>< Pics>

<text>I wont complain about the wait time because it's not the employee's fault.  Food was good. Glad we were able to switch out the rotten grapes for bananas without an issue.

<review>We just got our order from uber eats. The pancakes are always great, but unfortunately the service from the dennys worker was not very helpful over the phone. Dennys didn't have a section to select sides for dinners. I followed the directions and called the establishment. The lady who took the call pretty much brushed me off when I asked if I could have mashed potatoes and asked for a veggie side. She said she was too busy and I need to fix it on the app. I told her uber said to call the merchant.  She hung up on me and I wasn't able to get any resolve. I ended up getting a whole mess of just dry mashed potatoes with a chicken fried steak plopped on it. I highly suggest Dennys management look into that, please. I also sent review to UberEats and sent an email to corporate. Thanks.</review></record>

Food was ready pretty fast & my burger was really good... only thing negative is the fries were so over cooked I could barely eat most of them. Our waiter was extremely nice & very good, always kept our drinks topped off. Good place to eat.</Text>

Service was really great... Attentive, quick, and answered all our questions, she made good recommendations. Food was OK, but can't complain for the price. It's a good value. Did not have to deal with drunks or homeless people like in the past. A good alternative to the diner down the street.</Text>

<date>1543320086409</date><Review>Dennis could really be a hit-or-miss depending on which location really depends on the service you'll get crappy service not that they're too busy or the food isn't up to par. I found some locations with insufficient staff where there be just simply with numbers hope the food handlers for the mental capacity of their employees. But this location on El Cajon Boulevard just so happens to be one of the good ones friendly service and I like to judge a breakfast house on their pancakes and Denny's pancakes are always fluffy and very good. Lunch fast easy and cheap can never go wrong with a burger dinner to enjoy.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Hank Tuipala< /Name><UserId.>103635766750303186895< /UserId.><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Just had the Chicken Loaded Potato Skillet from the value menu and it is a very satisfying meal. It has a good combination of ingredients served on a sizzling Skillet. The chicken is tender and veggies are fresh. Toped with cheese's and sour cream it makes for a delightful meal!  With friendly staff and quality Cook's it is a comfortable place to relax and enjoy alone, with friends or family. Yummy!< /Review>< Pics>

The French Toast Slugger also comes with 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon, full size juice AND coffee for $8.99. Our waitress, Maria was so patient, gave excellent customer service. Food was delicious.< /review>

I give Denny's a 5 star especially at this location because I felt some LUV from my server and it was from the ❤ heart...just a real lady doing her job and making me feel like family.  That's worth 5 stars and more to me,   Thanks Denny's....this is being 100....u feel me?   The world needs more people like this for our next generation to know and understand that its takes more than a slogan it relay that feeling it takes courage to care openly💜   That is the best way I can explain it. HAVE A GREAT DAY...   :)< /review>

<Text>Just had the Chicken Loaded Potato Skillet from the value menu and it is a very satisfying meal. It has a good combination of ingredients served on a sizzling Skillet. The chicken is tender and veggies are fresh. Toped with cheese's and sour cream it makes for a delightful meal!  With friendly staff and quality Cook's it is a comfortable place to relax and enjoy alone, with friends or family. Yummy!< /Text>< Pics>

Stopped by for a late snack (12am)with the family before heading home. It was busier than I thought it would be. So our food took some time. After getting our food it wasn't as good as it could have been but for the time it was good enough. Service was good considering the time and its busyness.</Text>

<review>EVERYTHING feels RUSHED there. We only went there ONCE and that was enough for me/us. I dont care if we are on EL CAJON BLVD. or on La Jolla Drive. The service should always be the same BUT you only can accomplish that when YOU have a LEADER ,POINTING the way and not a MANAGER.

Small venue but great food at a good price. It's what you can expect from a Denny's. Good service overall, and the waitress really did her best to work out seating arrangements for our big party despite limited seating.< /Text>

<review>Food was to typical Denny’s standard, server was great but the rest of the staff seemed to be uncomfortable that my family and I were there. We were a party of 8, but we were completely polite and didn’t ask for anything out of the ordinary. Alexis Estrada was extremely rude to our party and asked us to move from 3 tables to 2 tables because he needed the table.< /review><Time>1546227068568</Time>< Pics>

Best Denny's ! Clean, organized, good vibes !  Leticia gave me great service.  She took care of my breakfast order right away, my T bone steak mid-rare n' eggs and orange tea.  For the 1st time in Denny's kufos to tye chef, because he cooked my steak to perfection, it was mid-rare 😃  I was there this morning on Memorial Day 2019 at 545 am, will come back again .< /text>

<text>Food is great service is friendly no complain whatsoever 👍

04-14-2021    5 years ago, they had great service. But unfortunately today there was no “soup of the day “ , no Buffalo wings, no tarter sauce for my fish fillet, no coke ( as in it was mostly clear, and it tasted like the filters needed to be changed ASAP ) staff made light of the situation. Sadly I am forced to give it a star because it’s the lowest I can give, but they also deserve a thumbs down 👎</text>< date>

Not my favorite, seems that service is getting worse every time I go in. Yes I request my bacon crispy (it never is, more like almost raw) ALWAYS have to send it back. I get the confused look... seriously does any restaurant advertise limp, raw bacon? I'll get eggs but no toast, toast arrived eggs are cold. I'm done!<//review>

<Review>Dennys has been a staple in my life for a long time. Whether it was in highschool as a goth kid and I needed to get outve the house and relax with a meal or a coffee. Or a reasonably priced dinner with my daughter and fiance. There is always a new promotion going on and food to price ratio is usually very good on the wallet. Plus being open 24/7 for someone with restless leg syndrome and sleep issues is a blessing in disguise.<//Review>< Name>

Love that's close to home & better area than the one off university & Fairmont.

The ONLY reason we give it a 3 vs 5 stars ia due to employees vulgar language...having personal conversations which customers that speak Spanish understand it.  Not professional.</Review>

But c’mon they’ve got breakfast, dinner, dessert, whatever you could possibly be craving. Want fries with your pancakes? Why not.

It's only hard to get a seat on Sundays, besides that there's usually a seat or table open, or the wait is minimal, like 5 minutes.. They refill drinks regularly, they even let me take some coffee to go. The food is what you paid for in terms of taste and quality. They service is usually pretty good too.<//Review>

<text>Marie Belle Rodriguez had horrible customer service skills. She hung up on me. She told me to call back. She told me to ask for the manager, which oh by the way, she is the manager. I want more then my money back. I want my time back which is what she waisted. The worst part about it is that she (and the employees) answered the phone in Spanish. I continued to asking about it my order and there was no  communication because your employee did not know any English. I am no racist or fascist by any means. But if I can not understand or communicate with the people in my own country to order food, this is a problem. Yes, this is me making a point while I file a formal report to your corporate office.</text>< pics>

<Text>Went after a ladies night out.  A server saw my friends & I standing @ the door, didnt say welcome, be right there, she was mute.

Five minutes later someone scurried us to a dirty table, sat us down, then proceeded to clean the table😥, yes I want dirt & old food on my clothes, thanks for asking.

It wasn't busy @ 12:30 am, it still took 30 minutes for food.</Text>< resp>

A great Denny' s located right on El Cajon Blvd, it is frequently busy, but service is excellent. Not the largest location, but I've never have to wait too long. Food quality has always been great, and prices are fair, as usual for this chain.<//review>

One of my many home Dennys I go to.  When it comes to a cheap Breakfast platter, this is the place I go to.  The waitresses are nice, they're bilingual, and they aim to please.  One flaw, they sometimes memorize which can be to their downfall.  If you have a complicated order and they're not taking it down, check on your order because  it may not have mentally been implicated.< /text>

This Denny's is your typical American diner. They are 24 hours, inexpensive, clean, friendly staff and usually quick service. We have had good experiences here, better than several of the other Dennys in San Diego.<//text>

I don't feel comfortable eating at Denny's anymore seems to be having some kind of negative vibrations.

<Review>Went after a ladies night out.  A server saw my friends & I standing @ the door, didnt say welcome, be right there, she was mute.

Five minutes later someone scurried us to a dirty table, sat us down, then proceeded to clean the table😥, yes I want dirt & old food on my clothes, thanks for asking.

It wasn't busy @ 12:30 am, it still took 30 minutes for food.< /Review>< user>

<Text>This place would merit 5 stars easily if it had not been for our server Maggie. Don't get me wrong, Maggie provided excellent service, but she made the mistake of talking about us in Spanish to the customer across the isle from us. She asked them if they had the soup and when they told her no she laughed and said "Oh, it was that fat girl." Tip forfeited.< /Text>< user>

< Review>
This Manager is rude he is a Hispanic male I asked why was there a dog in there sitting on the bench where people wait and and eat he said that’s not my business and he can do what ever he wants because he is the manager. Dogs don’t belong in Denny’s scratching all over the seats this is nasty. What a bad manger to answer rudely. He should be fired.</Review>

Lucky i even gave it a star wouldnt even consider it after my expirience at this establishment .1st i came in at 4am hungry tired and just going through alot , justbwanted to enjoy a place to sit a warm plate of pancakes , rather then that i got to enjoy looking at the menu for strong half hour to witch i was asked if id like to start with something to drink and my server would bring it shortly ... Well 45 min later after blaintently ignoring me serbing an entire table that arrived after me , repeatedly ignored my gestures eye contact and of course polite attempts at asking to take my order .. Still no water or even a hello .. Finally i called the front desk.. On my phone ..witch was 3 seats in feont of me where my waitress answered politely and ready to help, and i say i was wandering if i could order for pick up of short stack of pancakes she said yes of course who is this for ? I said oh just the guy sitting in the back that youve been ignoring for rhe past 45 minutes.. She immediately went back to looking around like i dont exist dumb look on her face .. I am sorry but i just lost it there and stormed off ... With out ne water whatsoever .. I have never felt so utterly disrespected by a food service worker ..doesnt matter what any of her issue is i did nothing wrong to her to be treated that way .. The fact i had to call a server 20 ft away on his cell phone to ask for his order because the server doesnt think its her job to not ... Do her job?? Worst resturant ever seriously lady nothing personal but i hope you find yourself in a similar situation some day when its already been alot of things
This is episode 1 of three please see dennys store on midway for part 2 ..<//Text>

The manager "E", for not saying his entire name, spent time talking to a woman as I entered the place. He didn't acknowledge my waiting as they continue talking. They both realized that I was standing - waiting to be seated - and he was the one with the task of greeting and seating people. I got tired of waiting and left the place... Not even a welcome to Denny's. I called the place to notify the real manager, but "E" answered the phone saying that he was the manager. I said that for a manager he did a crappy job, and was rude to me...along with the lady who also knew I was waiting and continued talking with him. Then he rectified and said he was the "manager at the time".
I left him know that both should learn how to treat people and be polite. I'll never go there again. I went the day before this incident, which was Mother's Day, but it was crowded, then I tried today with much less people and got this? Never again!<//text>

Dennys is Dennys.  You can order anything  just by pointing at the the menu and prices are okay.  They no longer carry onion rings but you can still get French frys and gravy. Waitressesvand waiters are polite and prompt. Worth 30% for tip.</Review>

Sat down and waited for the server to bring us menus and she never did. Waited for 15 mins and than we left. I feel the server was racists because my hubby is black. Poor services<//text>

Got seated right away. Ordered coffee and there was lipstick on the rim. MANAGER who iS cute as hell, and i believe he name was Alen  took care of it right away.
Restaurant was clean, and busy, it's 1030pm. Food came hot and super fast.</Text>

How can anyone go to an establishment to eat and your waitress cant understand  english. Most of our order was pointing fingers at the pictures. The only thing we could order was the choices that had a picture. How could I experience this at a dennys. The only good thing was the food. Delicious. She never returned for refills.<//text>

<Review>The service was adequate for the late night drunk crowd. The people I was with didn't believe in tipping but I tipped anyways. The food was cooked to perfection. But everyone else in my party complained about every small thing.< /Review></record>

Service was downright terrible. Waitress seated us in the back corner and goes "sorry I'm putting you in the back!" We were ok with it since we liked how quiet it was then after we get our drinks and condiments (which one of our party touched with his finger) she comes back to say "hey so this spot fits a group of 9 could you move to the booth over there?" And the group she promised our spot to, the seats we were currently sitting in, was standing at the entrance watching us, so do we have a choice? We discreetly and reluctantly move and staff doesn't help us move our things basically move what you can hold and leave the rest. What pisses me off is that we actually waited for our table and they walk in and basically get vip service. Sorry is the money my group worked for invalid compared to this group of 9 who just so happened need our specific booth when there was literally a row of empty tables along the wall parallel to us. So the manager Fran decides to be the one to ask about billing and pissed off as I am I ask her "do we seriously need to pay this entire $42.58 meal after your staff literally moved us as we were about to enjoy our meal? Because that was extremely inhospitable and embarrassing having to move our dishes and personal things and lug it literally across the room in front of other people scowling at us" and she has the audacity to cut me off and raise her voice saying "WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU LET ME EXPLAIN THIS HAS 16 TABLES." So I cut her off right back tried repeating myself and she said no you're paying and walked away. She understood me clearly, I have a stutter but not to where I can't form a coherent sentence. So now knowing were all displeased the entire staff shuns us until we have to sign the bill they send ANOTHER person and he is short with words basically meaning "sign and leave quickly"  he didn't want to have to deal with an angry group but his unprofessional manager forced him to since she didn't want confrontation. I wouldn't have been as pissed if I was still told wed get no compensation if she had a valid reason as to why or if she didn't yell at us but being that she did here I am putting her on blast. Thanks Fran wasting my hard earned money oh and I hope your party of 9 knew that the ranch we had to leave at our old had fingers in it because I totally saw them using our dishes they didn't switch out<//Review>

Hands down this is the best Denny's in the area. I've been to the one in National City and the two on E street in Chula Vista, and I rather drive 7 miles to get to this one.
Service has been great and so has the food.
It tends to be crowded for lunch, but it's worth the wait.</text>

<review>Really bad service. There was no one in the restaurant and they still made us wait 30 minutes to sit down. They took over an hour to bring us our food, when there was only one other customer in the restaurant. And there was a hair in our food and overall very bad experience.<//review><Response>None</Response><name>Mayra Gonzalez< /name></record></dataset><record>

<review>I usually love dennys , put in an order to go , classic burger, suppose to $6.99, I paid extra for seasoned fries , also an order of pancake puppies.and a pot roast dinner. Picked the food, I asked why the total was so much, they charged me $ 9.59 for a build your own burger, the cashier's said he changed the price , I used a coupon. I got home looked at the food the fries were over cooked , unedible .I looked  at the receipt the price had not been changed, I call them , all the manager kept saying was sorry</review>< user>

The burger could have been done better, but I digress. The problem was when the manager was supposed to correct a mistake and take $3 off, he only took about a dollar off and I didn't notice until I got home.<//Text>

I tried ordering from the app but my order didn't go through. The young lady at the cash register put my order in and it was back out pronto. Didn't lose a lot of time and got it exactly the way I wanted.< /Text>

< review>
I hate to give a bad review but we stop by to eat around 8:40am and the restaurant felt dirty. They sat us close to the bathrooms and u can feel a bad smell coming from their. Its 8:40am they shouldnt have that smell. I even told my husband they needed to use bleach to clean the bathroom so it can kill the smell. Another thing the menu i received had a hair eww 😷 and they where some flies too, bad bad. They where trying to land on our food some even stop by on the syrup good thing we didn't eat pancakes. Anyways service was good food was okay.  Wont go again!<//review>

Won't be going to that place any more .what wrong ? A lot . To star our order was wrong .then they take it back to fix it and took forever .when we got our order back bacon was cool .they took bacon back and we ask to talk to the manager .he stud up in front of our table and said  yes (on a very passive aggressive way) we finish breakfast and 15 min later pancakes finally  arrive .the manager give us the money back from 1 breakfast  only to find out  we got xtracharge for caramel and vanilla  cream that the pancakes suppost to come with (dulce de leche pancakes)</text>

<Review>Decent Denny's to go to for Sunday brunch or heck any other day. Most Sundays it's packed and the time I went was no different. The wait staff looked overworked and understaffed so I'm gonna cut them a break. The food was just like any other Denny's though so not much to rave about.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>I gotta tell ya this little Dennys on El Cajon Blvd. is one of the better Dennys, I've been here between 5&7 pm for a quick dinner several times and the cooks here are really good & "Perfectly Cooked " meals every time. I had a waitress named Karina really "Nice & Attentive" worthy of a big tip too. My wife had a "Senior Turkey Dinner Plate". She let me have a taste and I wanted to cry, cuz it reminded me of Grammas Turkey Dinner from the early 80's. My Moon over Mihami was over the Moon too Karina exchanged the hash browns for fries then pancakes for dessert OMG. We had to be wheelchaired out to our car we were so full.

<review>I ordered a bourbon bacon burger with no veggies or mushrooms and I had to send it back three times because they kept putting veggies on it , by the time I got to start eating my guest had already finished their meal and was watching YouTube then the manager decided that taking only $5 off was sufficient and to add salt to the wound even acted like that was a problem, this dennys is not a good restaurant and I would not recommend it . Also the servers attitude was horrible every time she brought the burger out and I said "asked for no vegetables "
And she would argue with me this was by far my worst experience with dennys .< /review>< Name>

The food was good,the waitress was sloppy we had to get our own silverware, I had to walk to the counter to get hot sauce & ketchup ect...& our food sat under the warmer more than 5 minutes ,& My daughter is 10 years old & the waitress refused to give her a kids menue cause she(waitress) kept saying that she (My daughter)was 13 years old so she isn't considered a child, then she brought her the wrong order,so her bacon got cold before she receive the rest of her meal.We come here all the time & have never experienced this before!</text>

I gotta tell ya this little Dennys on El Cajon Blvd. is one of the better Dennys, I've been here between 5&7 pm for a quick dinner several times and the cooks here are really good & "Perfectly Cooked " meals every time. I had a waitress named Karina really "Nice & Attentive" worthy of a big tip too. My wife had a "Senior Turkey Dinner Plate". She let me have a taste and I wanted to cry, cuz it reminded me of Grammas Turkey Dinner from the early 80's. My Moon over Mihami was over the Moon too Karina exchanged the hash browns for fries then pancakes for dessert OMG. We had to be wheelchaired out to our car we were so full.

The waitress was sweet as pie. The food was, meh. I should have gone with my instincts and dined at another place. Burnt toast is never awesome.</Text>

Impressed by how bad our server was, but the other staff helped our table when possible. Also I've tried to eat here before but they were only accepting cash at the time. Won't be coming back to this Denny's.< /Review>

< review>
The food was alright, but the waiter didn't seem friendly nor welcome, Alexis who was the waiter didnt seem he wanted to be there and to lean or not stand properly while taking an order its not professionaly not even good eye contact nor a smile.. The waiter only came to our table twice to refill a cup of coffee and to pick up the plates! After picking up most of the plates asked if we needed anything else it felt as if we were being rushed, didn't offer more napkins, nor a refill on a cold beverage until I was leaving. If your going to have some sort of attitude or not be greeting properly I advise you to find something better that will make you smile.<//review>

<Review>The food was alright, but the waiter didn't seem friendly nor welcome, Alexis who was the waiter didnt seem he wanted to be there and to lean or not stand properly while taking an order its not professionaly not even good eye contact nor a smile.. The waiter only came to our table twice to refill a cup of coffee and to pick up the plates! After picking up most of the plates asked if we needed anything else it felt as if we were being rushed, didn't offer more napkins, nor a refill on a cold beverage until I was leaving. If your going to have some sort of attitude or not be greeting properly I advise you to find something better that will make you smile.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

It's a Denny's, if you're looking for an experience that is somehow better than other Denny's this is not the place for you<//review>

The people who work here are always nice and attentive. They have to deal with a variety of patrons who are at times not very respectful. I guess every restaurant that open 24/7 and corporate have to deal with the homeless population. It is not fair to the servers who work hard to provide for themselves/family.< /Review>

It's Denny's. Traditional dinner food, and open 24 hours. What more do you need to know?</review>

<review>Seriously, slow service, waiter spilled coffee on my leg, no apologies. Mediocre food, no offer to comp meal for the inconvenience of wearing my coffee. Was never really a fan of Denny's anyway, certainly not now.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Typical American place where you eat well and cheaply. Also 24h and very friendly. Almost everyone speaks Spanish. We asked for 3 things to share between 2 people and it was enough. Half nachos, quesadillas and a chicken platter with broccoli and cheese sauce. With refillable drinks about 32 dollars.
Nachos very rich, regular quesadillas and healthy and rich chicken.

(Original)
Lugar típico americano donde se come bien y barato. Además 24h y muy amables. Hablan español casi todos. Pedimos 3 cosas para compartir entre 2 personas y fue suficiente. Media de nachos, quesadillas y una fuente de pollo con brócoli y salsa de queso. Con bebidas rellenables unos 32 dólares.
Nachos muy ricos, quesadillas regular y el pollo sano y rico.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Good casual restaurant, open 24 hours, fast food service. They serve from brunch, lunch and dinner. Good for conventional sandwiches and fattening portions. Typical American food restaurant. It is worth eating from time to time a lot of calories per square meter.

(Translated by Google) To get in it is very dirty, on the ground, like greasy, the food very burnt and salty, it was a horse with egg that asked for coffee and the girl never asked again if I wanted more, of course I wanted and asked for a discount as a disability and do not give it if I do not have a card from that place. And it came out as expensive as if I had gone to a place of lux

(Original)
Para entrar esta muy sucio .por fuera el suelo .como grasiento.la comida muy quemada y salada.fue un cborizo con huevo q pedi.pedi cafe y nunca volvio la muchacha a preguntar si qieria mas.claro que queria y pedi descuento de senor como discapacidad y no lo dan si no tengo una tarjeta de ese lugar .y me salio igual de caro como si hubiera ido a un lugar de lux</review>

(Translated by Google) Dennys restaurant, everyone knows it, is the classic American restaurant with good service and uniformity in food and procedures; Or what is the same, there is good service - although not perfect - and good seasoning in the meals. Suddenly a waitress over there does not capture a request well, but that's all.

(Original)
El restaurante Dennys, todos lo conocen, es el clásico restaurante americano con buena atención y uniformidad en los alimentos y procedimientos; o lo que es lo mismo, hay buena atención--aunque no perfecta-- y buen sazón en las comidas.

<text>(Translated by Google) I went to have dinner with my family, I asked for an omelet and the omelet was not good, it was rough, badly arranged, it was not good that night.
Apart from that, the cook came out to tell lamesera that, like Melo, it would not matter the same as in the photo of the menu I mark marqiez
I think that cook has been working for a long time and serves things like lega sugana grasias. And there were also some winged clients that seemed to be pigs repeating some pure nonsense
Greasy

Pienso que ese cocinero yieme mucho tiempo trabajando y sirve las cosas como leda sugana grasias. Y tanbien avia unos clientes alado que paresia que eran unos marranos repitindo resio puras tonteras
