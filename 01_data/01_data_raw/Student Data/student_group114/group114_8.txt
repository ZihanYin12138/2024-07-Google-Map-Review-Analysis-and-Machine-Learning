I would recommand the vegetarian momos which are served with this amazing spicy sauce. Almost as good as the ones served in Kathmandu.<//review>< pictures>

<text>So good I went back the next day during a work trip.  The usual suspects for a Nepalese restaurant are delicious.  But, so is the chicken chow mein.  Far surpassed some of the others recommended the ethnic restaurants in the area.  Go.< /text>< resp>

< Review>
For the price it's going to be hard to find any Indian or Nepali food this delicious *anywhere*, let alone San Francisco.

The service is quick and friendly. The man at the register was pleased with our choices but made suggestions, as well.

Be sure to order the Samosa Chat; incredibly tasty!

If you want something different than the usual Indian fare, order from the Nepali menu.

We tried the Newari Khaja which was a Nepali thali of sorts; I definitely recommend it, but be sure to order something saucy as well. Between the beaten rice and the ultra-crisp fried meat it can get pretty dry without some sauce.

You can probably dine in for lunch, but beware that the seating is very limited for busier hours, and it's not the nicest neighborhood. Otherwise take-out or delivery are great options, too.< /Review>

Ate the Lamb Korma. Delicious, but the parsley was dehydrated and hadn’t rehydrated. Naan bread tastes recooked (flat & dense). All in all, a decent meal.</Review>

<review>Great food; the owner/ chef is very friendly and tries to accommodate guests even if they are overbooked . The food can be very spicy but can be made milder upon request. The portions are generous but not huge and given how reasonably priced everything is it's easy to over order and have lots of delicious leftovers for the next day ++<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Failed to deliver.  Driver did not attempt to knock on the door or ring the doorbell.  Fairly sure the driver didn't even try to come by at all.  Restaurant refused to refund anything for their failure and forced me to go through the chargeback process instead.<//Text>

From the outside you just wouldn’t believe how big the restaurant is or the quality of its food. It has a long bar on entering and then a large restaurant area at the back. The night we eat there ( Monday) was quiet to start with as we arrived about 6.30pm but tables soon started to fill up. The service was friendly and quick. We were immediately given glasses of water which were consistently topped up. We both ordered a version of Tikka Masala which was well flavoured with spices. Accompanied by rice and naan and some Indian beer it ended our day of sightseeing and shopping perfectly. If your in San Francisco and fancy an Indian give the New Delhi a try .<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Time>

We came from Dallas and wanted to have authentic Nepali food so we decided to try Newa. But this was one worst experience. We asked for one Newari set and Daal bhaat thali. They didn't have achar so they just replaced food items with kheer. And at the end didn't even apologize or even try to give us a discounted price. Will never ever try this place again.<//Text>

Accessibility: cramped for wheelchairs. They sometimes prop open their door with a traffic cone, making it difficult to enter. However, after going there a few times I think they learned and made the entrance more accessible. This restaurant is accessible, just not convenient to maneuver around. It is, however, probably the best Indian/Nepalese food in SF.< /Text>

<review>The food price is reasonable but my experience was horrible with NeWa. We ordered our food through GRUBHUB and somehow they messed up the order. They sent us a different item in the place of the ordered one. On top of that,  instead of being apologetic, they talked very rudely and blamed us for their own mistake while having a phone conversation.< /review><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808580901f0e4ef3:0xc14f5f1cdbbe9634< /gmap_id>< user_id>

< Review>
Not sure why this restaurant has any good reviews. First of all this is not a newari restaurant. The name got us deceived. The location is also not that good. Usually I wouldn’t write a bad review for a Nepali restaurant because my peeps but this one is bad. It’s gonna give a bad rep to other Nepali restaurants.

1. Cleanliness 1/5. - very dirty. It smells very bad 🤢 Horrible place to dine in.

2.  Food 2/5. Ordered momo. I think you really need to try hard to get it wrong. Also ordered newari khaja. Choila was very disappointing. My parents ordered daal bhat. They were saying the rice smelled too. The only thing that was ok was the alu Ko achar.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>This is a small restaurant with different flavored Nepalese food in the heart of Down-town San Francisco. we had chicken momos  for the appetizers which was very tasty.  Chowmeen was not that flavored as we expected. But to cover it up, we had some typical Nepalese foods that tasted very flavored-full.
The restaurant's atmosphere was not that great it may be because we saw a lot of homeless people walking outside and staring from the door and windows. We were awkward with the situation. At the end the price tag and with the food quality absolutely fair. You can visit here for the typical Nepalese food.</review>< Pictures>

It isn't in the best part of town, but I highly recommend this for it's great prices and good food. I got chicken curry with rice and naan bread for a traditional Nepali meal and it was delicious<//Review>

I usually don’t review, but I couldn’t resist myself undoing the review for this palce.
First impression, very unclean, unstable dining table & not so welcoming staff.
Second impression,  We ordered chicken chowmin and Chicken mo:mo. Chowmin was ok, but the mo:mo was disaster. It was raw from inside, I could literally see the red meat lurking inside but the Chatney was good.
Never ever going to this place again.<//Text>

I don't know how this place has multiple 5 star reviews. It was horrid and unhygenic .  We dined  in  there. The dumplings were cold inside, like frozen cold. The kofta curry was absolutely horrendous. Chilli chicken fried dumplings were okay.</review>

High quality Indian fare, large portions in a sketchy neighborhood.  I will definitely be back.   The food is the equal to places which cost far more.  I've had the Tandoori, both chicken and lamb saag.<//review>

I have ordered food from newa couple of times. Extremely satisfied with the service and food quality both times. I would definitely recommend the Nepali menu like the chowmein and the Momo. The staple indian fare of veg and chicken curry are also better than average.< /review>

Good food, sketchy location - friendly people, reasonable prices and authentic Nepalese food. Best for takeway. Location is NOT an area tourists should be hanging about and definitely not at night. Welcome to SF where Halloween is a daily event!</Text>

They have good momos, weight time wasn't too terrible.

Staff is polite and respectful.
Might go back to this place.

I went there for Newari food which I didn't find much of.
I would recommend making the place more authentic, adding more othentic food options.< /Text>

Restaurant is good. Its a nepali + Indian.
I would say they prepare the food in advance and store it. Fresh naan. Staff is good and polite.
The neighbour hood is little bad and sketchy, just be careful in evening time. Seating us limited.
There are other Indian and pakistani restaurants closer.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Food was very tasty. Biriyani was excellent. Chicken tikka masala and Aloo gobi were good too. It is a small joint with just couple of tables. Go for the food not for the looks. Next time will try Nepalese Mo Mo!< /Review><date>1512867033470</date><userid>109849026903893201606<//userid>< name>

A total hidden gem. Amazing fresh naan. Free chai. And amazing nepali/ indian dishes. Cosy and quiet, it's far above the busier and more expensive places nearby.</Text>

Only Authentic Nepali restaurant in Bay Area. Very much impressed with their food. You can get everything here form Mouth watering Mo:Mo to Sukuti.
You can even get Newari Khaja which is served in Tapari. What a Classic way to Serve Authentic Newari Khaja.< /Text>

<Text>Really good selection of Nepali dishes here. I haven't seen a california Nepali restaurant with this extensive list of Nepali items in the menu yet.

Definitely coming back. I had the lamb choila that was part of the Newari khaja which was really tasty. Waiting to try the c momo which looked really good.</Text>< Rate>

We "happened" to go into Mythical Dragon today...all I can say is WOW! What an amazing experience we had.
I asked Kat what stones would be good for healing my daughter who has cancer....she immediately said "oh let me work on her". She sat my daughter down and went to work, with two of her healing ladies. I was so amazed at how quickly all of the ladies felt the sickness within my child. They gave us so many tips and symbols to use for strength during this difficult time. Shirley who is an animal healer picked up on our dog's vibes and told us the dog was worried about what they were doing to her "kid/puppy".  It was really amazing how spot on they were with what my kiddo needed to hear. We have been past the shop many times and today we were supposed to enter in. Thank you Mystical Dragon for the loving support you showered on my baby today!< /text>

When I said that we shouldn’t bring up the topic anymore she kept on bringing it up and got defensive. She kept on talking about it and I stayed quiet and couldn’t even say anything or at least get my point across so I decided to leave it at that. The energy was definitely not good coming from her. I’ve always came here for crystals, oracle cards and tarot readings for several years now but I will definitely never go back to that place. Its a shame because I used to love going there and I liked the people who did the readings there. Definitely felt like I needed an energy cleansing after leaving that place, it gave me a bad feeling from that woman. POC be aware.<//Review>< Pics>

This is a Charming little shop in coastal Oceanside on the Coast Highway. when I went there, I was welcomed by both of the ladies who were working, and invited to ask any questions that I might have pertaining to anything that they sold. They have a great selection of small stones as well as a good selection of shaped gemstones and such. They have some kitschy things as well if that is what you are into, but the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because other than the small stones, they did not have a very wide selection of much else and their prices are somewhat high. It may simply be that they have to charge more for things because of paying rent on the coast, but suffice it to say everything else about it is wonderful.my advice would be to either go there just to find out what it's like, or if you have more specific needs to call them first to see if they have what you're looking for. Have fun!<//Text>

On April 16th I had a phone reading with Victoria. When I called back for my reading I had to call 4 times before they would pick up the phone. When I mentioned this to the receptionist she very rudely said "yes I was probably making a transaction." From there she took my money and proceeded to leave me sitting on the phone for nine minutes waiting for my reading until I finally hung up and called. When I stated she left me hanging for 9 minutes there was no apology, she simply said "I was with a customer." Apparently this girl is a new employee, she's incredibly rude and has zero customer service skills. You don't leave someone hanging on the phone for 9 minutes and not come back and let them know they are with another customer or ask if they would like a call back. In total, I had to call 9 times! If the owner looks at her phone records go to April 16th around 1:30 and check how many calls from one number you received.
I have spent a lot of money with mystical dragon over the last few years but I can assure you I will not be coming back. Too bad that is a lost customer for Victoria who is wonderful.< /text>

Everyone here is extremely nice and helpful.
I like coming here for my readings! There is a rather large selection of incense, candles, books, tarot cards, crystals,jewelry and many other items to choose from. This is one of my favorite places to visit here in North County.< /Text>

They have a nice selection of gems/tarot, but  I would have felt more inclined to make a purchase if hadn't overheard the negative communication style the owner uses with her employees.</text>

The Mystical Dragon is an amazing experience!  It is not an ordinary retail store,. They offer classes, Psychic Readings of all kinds, including Tarot, Astrology, Palmistry, and more...all by experienced and authentic readers who are among the best in the world.
It has a wealth of unusual and quality items and you can easily find yourself spending hours mesmerized by it all.  There are books, jewelry, crystals, incense, large crystal geodes and clusters, Tarot decks, and so many interesting things from all over the world that the list is endless...
,
You can find all things unique, beautiful, magickal, and mystical, with an awesome list of informative classes, meetings, and opportunities to explore a myriad of subjects and meet many interesting people.  The staff is highly knowledgeable about a wide variety of spiritual subjects and friendly too!

This is a fantastic place and I highly recommend it!!!!  It changed my life!</Review>

I found a crystal necklace that it's purpose is to assist in weight loss and have been wearing it every since I bought it. The readers are amazing and I highly recommend that you contact them for a reading, they can help guide you through any issue that you may be experiencing at this time in your life. I highly recommend Sam especially, he is so right on with his insight and messages you wont be disappointed.

Their hours say they're open until 5pm. We came at 2:30 and pushed on the door and it was locked. All the lights were on and there is no closed sign. There was a lady standing at the counter not acknowledging us, door says push to open so we tried again but nothing. I guess they don't care about business if someone stands inside and blatantly ignores customers</Review>

<Time>1619291143640< /Time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>Absolutely miserable place. Staff are unprofessional and lazy. Was in there for three days  and then released without a prescription for my meds in the right pharmacy (so I went through withdrawals) and they couldn’t even send it to the right location. Had to do that myself. As well, I needed a work release form. I spent 3 days calling them non-stop to get it and they never resolved the issue until a day before I had to return to work. Even when they did resolve it, they did not tell me that it was resolved. Don’t under any circumstances go to this hospital. Dealing with them after my stay there was even more traumatizing than the situation that put me there in the first place.< /Text>< pictures>

I went to fremont hospital monterey unit. I think that it was definitely a experience to remember. But did not like was that they keep the kids in there rooms and didn't let them come out if they did they made us stay in our till 8:30 p.m. I liked sharon jonathan donnice vanessa gladys. those were the only good staff and i didnt like megan she was super rude and yelled at me multiple times please fire her or correct her attitude. That's all i got to say and i don't recommend coming here but things were nice so</review>

< Review>
Over prescribed me medications I didn’t need and went into psychosis, they also cut me off my benzos which is physically dangerous and can die from the withdrawals. I had 3 severe seizures while I was hospitalized here and the staff obviously are undertrained because they were not helping me in any form. I am not diagnosed with any psychotic symptoms, I was sent forcefully under a 51-50, I came out worse  when I was not at this terrible hospital. (and very sick from all the medications they gave me)
This place feels more like a prison than a inpatient service. While I was there we didn’t go outside and we are locked in a small little area, it’s pretty disgusting. PLEASE DO NOT SEND YOUR CHILD/LOVED ONE HERE IF YOU ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING FOR REAL PROFESSIONAL HELP<//Review>

<Text>While it was annoying to only see the doctor for a minute or two a day. The other staff and nurses are extremely kind and considerate. There was a male nurse that backed my reputation up when someone claimed I had tried to hurt them. This place helped me learn how to make friends.

My partner was transferred to this facility last night and I am the only one that is listed as his emergency contact. The front desk refused to connect me to a staff member that could give me an update because I didn’t have a security code. Reasoning being is because it’s a “HIPAA thing”. So why did they as for an emergency contact to for? My name and number is listed on the paperwork when we checked in. I’ve called several times already today with no luck. HIPAA should not apply in this case.<//Review>

< Review>
Fremont Hospital Outpatient services is the best outpatient program I've ever been too. I was hospitalized over and over for three years now and I tried several outpatient programs but this one was different. I learned how to cope with my panic attacks, my anxiety, how to be in the present moment, and so much more. I went in there thinking "great another program" and I came out of there stronger than ever. I feel found, I feel in control of myself, my emotions, my actions. I finally am able to live my life.<//Review>

<review>I was a patient sometime in May-June. They helped me a lot. I had a mentor.  He felt like a dad to me. His name was Jajuan. Really missing him..there were many more, very helpful people. Vanessa, KB, Sheeran, Louis, and my main brother Jonathan. (MISS YOU BRO) Harold, (main staff), lol and can't forget Juan, i was standing in the bathroom playing with the soap bar, and he made sure I washed my hands. Lmfao. Such a funny guy. And he even came back. Etc...nice people. They helped me keep a steady mentality. Made me feel like I was cared for and actually being listened to. Thanks to all of you for everything. I'll see you soon. As in that. I've not been doing well. So I'm prolly gonna end back up un there with y'all. And this time I ain't gonna be so cooperative. Cause my feelings have totally changed. And all I wanna do is die. But thanks for all the help you provided me...🥳

terrible hospital, made my mental health at the absolute lowest it has ever been, my doctor didnt listen to what ever i had to say and kept telling my mom that i wasnt gaining weight which i was, if youre thinking about going please do not. they do not how to treat eating disorder and used forceful methods and did not make me feel comfortable living there, the staff is terrible and constantly slammed doors and yelled at the kids. this place is an absolute joke and the staff does not take mental health seriously, if i could rate it zero stars i would.</text>

<text>when I was in this hospital, everything was fine. The only problem was the other teenagers there, and their uncontrollable behavior. Of course, that's not something the hospital can really change. They're in there for a reason I guess. Otherwise, most of my time spent there was okay.</text>< pics>

Getting anyone to call you back is a a waste of time. We left message after message for the Dr and nothing. Brittany, one of the workers there would try and assure us that a Dr would call as she was going to leave them a message, crickets. I would never leave my child there unless I lived within a short drive because communicating by phone is an exercise in futility. Unfortunately our child was sent there from Sacramento as the nearby hospitals were full. On day 9 now. Communication is the absolute worst.< /Review>

I stayed at Fremont Hospital for 12 days. I was only allowed outside recreation twice. It was horrible. The weather was good but they didn't let me out. They asked if anyone wanted to go to the cafeteria at lunchtime but didn't say that we could go outside (to a tiny patio) after lunch in the cafeteria.

I felt very claustrophobic because it's a locked facility and going outside would have helped. Several staff in the hospital were often dismissive and some, very unprofessional.

This hospital was also very restrictive compared to other psych hospitals. We were not even allowed to keep toothbrushes in our rooms so we had to find often overworked staff to get the toothbrushes out of our lockers in order to brush our teeth.

Overall, this felt like a place that houses people, not a place to help with compassion and care.<//Review>

Fremont Hospital have failed to give a proper treatment to my husband and put his life and loved ones at risk by releasing him early when he is still in need of treatment. Dr. S Punia was his Dr Psychiatrist and took my husbands condition lightly for assessing that he was good to go. A couple of hours from being released, my husband has been put back to the Emergency and once again have been placed into a hospital for more treatment. I have reached out to anyone from Fremont Hospital and have spoken to a head nurse named Jaspreet, a case manager named TJ, as well as the social worker supervisor Nasheem. They all have given me different messages on why my husband has been released but they all told me that Trisha Williams who is the CEO of the Fremont Hospital would give me a call back yet have not received a phone call.
Also, they have been falsifying their medical records on when they have been releasing their patients because my husband handed me a black and white released form from Fremont Hospital that was dated on November 8, 2019 instead of his actual release date on the 12th of November. With all of that being said, they have proven how incompetent they are when in comes to treating their patients and I will spread the word to whoever that would listen. Fremont Hospital should not be functioning and should not get more funds because of their false practices. My husband Condition is a proof of that and I will not let this go.</Text>

I had a good experience. Rooms are beautiful,nurses are professional and caring. The food is healthy and well prepared and served.  The doctors have done a good job with my son especially Dr. Patel.  She saved my son and I can't thank her enough. She exceeded my expectations. All the staff are professional and courteous starting from the front door guard  to the doctors.  Giving poor reviews to this beautiful facility is harsh and not fair to all the dedicated staff.< /Review>

The Eating Disorders Center is beautiful and teens will feel at home addressing their illness.  I think with its new leadership, this hospital will be a jewel for families seeking help to stabilize their acute child or parent's struggle with mental illness or addiction.</Text>< Rate>

My son stayed at the hospital for 6 days in December 2018. The hospital stay it self was fine. However the intake specialist (social worker) assigned to my son completely dropped the ball on numerous accounts and ultimately left him in a pretty serious situation. The intake specialist was beyond difficult to get ahold of and incompetent at his job.< /Review>

I came here after I tried to commit suicide and immediately I noticed that the staff there don't really care about the kids with the "small problems" like recently recently wanting to have killed themselves. They pay more attention to people with more severe problems which is great I just wish I myself had gotten more attention. I was traumatized and I needed someone to talk to..this hospital did literally nothing it was just a waste of my time and even more traumatizing< /Text>

<Text>I want to 1st start off by saying this place is the worst place ever to have a child sent.
They violate HIPPA LAW big time.. I work in the Medical and Dental field and what they have just done is considered a Law Suit.
When you the Guardian by a court order is calling and calling since the beginning to speak to not only the Dr.., but the Social Worker and main Nurse who's been taking care of your child. All you keep getting is the run around and told to call back between these hours, and you do. You still don't get to talk to them nor do they call you back. This is unacceptable for a medical facility to do this. But this facility wants to turn around and act as if you haven't been calling at all. Until you have to prove them wrong and then they can't say anything but mumble.
When a child is put in this type of facility there is a underline reason and if the Guardian of the child is calling, and calling. The Guardian has only given permission to certain people for this child you as a facility have to honor this and not think you can over step this. If those members of the family are also calling and calling and your doing the same thing to them. They are also in the Medical Field, that isn't good either..
You as a facility needs to have better training on all aspects of HIPPA Violations, the child Legal Guardian needs to be contacted by a Social worker or Dr.. within 2-3 days of the child arriving. Than after follow-ups and when the Legal Guardian is calling for these people. They better get a call back within 24-48 hours. This is ridiculous.<//Text>< Pictures>

my daughter was recently discharge. I was told the next day kaiser was going to call me to arrange following appoiments and kaiser didn't call me at all. I had to reach out to them. the hospital don't help them, when I asked my daughter if she felt they helped her, she answer that they don't help the only thing they do is stabilize them and that's all. she also told me that when she was at a group with other girls "a lady who was going to do the group started with "I had a long day, so don't make me act like a "B". In my opinion this is so unprofessional. my daughter was not given any form of therapy in my opinion. she also mentioned that girls and boy are put together for lunch and yard and kids manage to make boyfriends and girlfriends by passing notes. re-consider taking your love one here if she/he needs better reinforcement. The staff is nice the hopital is clean, however patience go there to get help. It is crucial that they get the reinforcement they need even though they will be there for a short period of time< /text>

If it wasn't for Matt Kuwalski, and his hard work, and his passion, I don't know where I will be today. The whole inpatient and outpatient teams and groups and doctors are all very loving, kind, and compassionate. They stand true to their claim that there is hope and recovery at Fremont hospital. Matt's philosophy of teaching is unique, and something that only Fremont hospital has. Through his experiences with mental illness, homelessness, addiction, etc. his knowledge is spread to us through what he writes. THank you Fremont Hospital and Matt Kuwalski and the rest of the team!< /Review>

worst. place. ever. i was here for 5 days in May of 2018 after trying to kill myself, it's now February 2019 and i still suffer symptoms of PTSD. After being released i couldn't sleep for months and whenever i made the mistake of falling asleep i would have night terrors and wake up screaming. the staff doesn't care about the kids, while i was there they referred to us as "problems". worst part is, i live in fremont and have to drive by it and see it everyday.</Text>

<Text>The worst hospital I have been to in my life. I should of never been there and I was treated not good. I might of well of been in Jail. It was a horrible and the staff was rude and mean. When you are really sick you are denied medical attention and have no say in anything. Most of the patient were great and looked up to me as a role model towards the end of my 5 day stay and that made me feel great for the first time in my life and i have been traumatised for my life being hauled upside down thanks for a pushy kaiser nurse or employee starting a rumor AKA lie in the ER. I will never forgive this tragic event.</Text>< pictures>

Horrible place ! My heart broke when i had to visit this place. This institution won't help you besides medicate the patients and shut them down. Seems like all about money and not really caring about the right treatment. If you can afford it - pick your own private facility !<//review>

<review>I still have nightmares about this facility 4 years after being there. You go here to be pumped full of medication and sent back out once they figure out how to bill you for the maximum amount humanly possible. If you need help, flee from this place, because you will not find it there.</review>< gmap_id>

Medical negligence such as unable / unwilling to administer cardiac Rx (Betapace) as per Kaiser MD instruction to a patient with congestive heart failure.  Reason "we don't have any". 5 doses missed & patient discharged home (lives alone) to Fresno home in a taxi cab ($550. fare). Fraudulent billing for MD visits not made & billed for a 70 min admission visit that was only 15 mins. (Ref: Dr. Deepak Kumar)  MD visit did not even include a formal mental status exam.  This hospital should be decertfied & fined by Health Dept.<//text>

Please, please be aware of the care your children get here. Try to be knowledgable of your children's medication and dosages. Dr Kumar and I came up with a plan to titrate my daughter's medication more rapidly. Upon discharge, I learned that she was actually taking less than what she was when she went in for treatment initially. Now she's weeks behind where she is supposed to be and was there for literally nothing. This medicine has severe and potentially fatal side effects if not monitored properly and hospitalization would allow for quick treatment should a reaction happen, now we are weeks behind where we are supposed to be. I'm so frustrated.

Also, I made a plan with Nashin on Friday for discharge on Monday. They talked to my daughter about this plan and we were all on board. Monday morning I called to ask what time would be best to discharge and they said they had not worked that out but asked what time i was thinking. I told him 3 would work and he said someone would reach out and let me know. No one did. I came for visitation at 430 expecting to pick her up but she was not ready to go. I inquired to the nursing staff about discharge and they said they would find me shortly to work it out. 30 minutes later I asked again. I was then informed that she would be discharging tomorrow. To which I declined and said to get her ready for discharge. They made me wait for Nashin to talk about a plan for discharge and he wanted to discharge her the next day. I again declined as the plan had been for her to discharge that day and no one had informed me otherwise.

The communication is so poor, the negligent medical care is abhorrent. I'm blown away. And truly devastated by the damage caused. I will have to work out a new plan with her actual psychiatrist to get her up to a therapeutic dose of her medication quickly and make up for 10 days of lost time.

Your children deserve better than this place can offer. Get them stable and get them out! Be informed! Reach out to me if you don't understand what the doctor is telling you. I want to help. I'm lucky enough to be knowledgable about this, I cant imagine how people are taken advantage of who don't understand the treatment and medical language.< /review>

<text>AVOID THIS PLACE!!
Horribly understaffed. Very expensive babysitting service. Some of their drivers drive scary fast and unsafe. For every week of in/outpatient you should expect a total of 10 minutes of a psychiatrist's time.
Every time I call back to follow up, they say, "yea, I have a note on my desk but what were we talking about? What was I supposed to do for you?"
The employees are nice, there just isn't enough of them, and they have a very hard time communicating with each other. Also if Lizzy says she'll call you back, don't hold your breath. In fact, most of them never call back. W
When asked "how much will it cost with my insurance?" The reply, "don't worry about it!" Should have been my first red flag. Conned and disappointed are not the feelings I want leaving a place I went for help.
If you can, avoid wasting your time with this place.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

So far so good. My loved one was initially taken to John George and they had a wait for a bed which may have taken about a week or so. We advocated for our loved one to be moved where she could begin immediate treatment and get the help that was needed and Fremont Hospital seems like a good choice despite reading some of the bad reviews. We were uncertain of what to expect as we had never gone through this. Once she was there we called and were explained the policy about the 4 digit code. It's discomforting when you haven't seen your family in 3 days and you just want to make sure they're alright; but it makes sense and also helps with the patient being a decision maker in who they allow to contact them or find out anything over the phone. Dealing with mental issues being angry and not wanting anyone to see or speak with you is a possibility so we were more so thinking like what if we never get the code? How will we know what's going on?  We then learned that regardless if we have a code or not we are still given an opportunity to show up in person during visiting hours. That was a deep sigh of relief because if she was having a day where she didn't want to communicate with anyone she would at least see our faces hear us say I Love You! And know that we just didn't forget about her or were just leaving her there to fight her battles alone.

When we showed up 5 minutes before visiting was over the front desk staff was very courteous. They answered all of our general questions and called the charge nurse for the more detailed ones. A gentlemen explained about bringing in personal items and how we can store our belongings in a locker before visiting. By the time we were ready to see her the clerk advised us the charge nurse said she was sleeping and they dont like to wake them. Keep in mind we hadn't seen her in a couple days and just wanted to make sure she was ok and looked ok physically and by then my mom was a nervous wreck because she was told the same thing at the other facility. When your dealing with adult patients there is only so much you can do as a parent since they are no longer children and dont require parent consent for care.

We asked if someone could come down and at least speak face to face because we had never gone through this. The nurse explained that she could not leave the station and we can always come back the next day during visiting. We did not get upset as you have to understand a policy is a policy. I gave it a shot and respectfully explained my mom's concern and asked if she could at least just see her face through a window and advised that she will not disturb or awaken her and she would only be a moment. The charge nurse agreed and we both were able to go up! We respectfully followed all procedures and were escorted to where she was In her room sleeping. Glancing around I was impressed that the floor was very secure but it didn't give that prison security feeling. It was pretty clean and didn't have an extreme hospital feel to it. It looks as if most of the rooms have 2 beds. We traveled a short distance and then there she was! Even though we were there for just a minute it felt like a huge weight was lifted off our shoulders and even though she didn't see us we were there together spiritually. Upon leaving we thanked the staff and stopped to personally thank the charge nurse. She then explained about the 4 digit code and answered my mom's other questions and then we left.

I know this was a long read but hopefully this helped or was comforting to someone who is on the same journey we are. As we continue on I will post updates regarding our experiences and adjust the rating as needed. A BIG THANK YOU! To the staff so far as first impressions can tell you alot about what you'll have to deal with. We definitely hope this continues so we can have a strong foundation for our loved one.

God Bless!< /review>

Ok I should probably take my face off Google before I say this (lol), but I've been 5 different hospitals and this is probably the best one I've been too....  the staff were accommodating, unlike other hospitals, and I really appreciated the off unit access, which one hospital didn't offer. The cafeteria had this delicious passionfruit juice as well. I was on the adolescent unit and I definitely appreciated how they let us use chalk on the walls. The groups were helpful as well. Look, this is a psych ward and not a 5 star hotel, and for what they're allowed to do, I think they're fair.</Text>

The timing lagged from the security wasting 10 min . Plan ahead upon arrival at least 30 minutes before 7pm. I only had 15 min. To spend with my child. I witnessed children that wanted attention ignored . From children crying , another child saying they could not breath. Staff telling another staff that and looked irritated and slow and annoyed. Another child asking with a small cereal and milk in her hand, where do I eat? Ignored and last another child telling the staff to help the other child that was crying who needed help also being ignored after 5 min. Then getting medicine im guessing to sedate the loud kid complaining that they are garbage and do nothing.  These places are for desperate need of help and I didn't see that.  These kids need allot of attention, activities, tv's, something to keep them comforted at this breaking point. Maybe soft music for inspiration.  I wish I could've stayed longer to help these kids but visiting hour was up and i had to say goodbye to my child. Wishing I could bring her home she said there was no therapy since her admitting.  Where is the help and where is the right staff to fit these positions??? Not a recommended place to send a child in desperate need of help and assistance .I can only say that my child did say they do constantly check they are being watched with the door open. I do agree to say that the staff doesn't care and maybe more so there just for the pay check.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>My adult daughter is there right now and the staff refuses to let me speak to her even tho she called me day before yesterday crying to come home. Supposedly had aahearing yesterday and no ones heard from her since the "hearing". Now they won't let me talk to her or tell me if she's even there, died in the night or walked out. Wont even patch me thru to her Social Worker. Feels like she's been medically kidnapped by this hospital.< /Review>< user>

My son was recently hospitalized there. He barely received the help he needed. There were incidents of kids sneaking into each other’s rooms to have sex. Meds were not administered or sent home. An overall disaster.< /text>
</record></dataset><record>
<text>I have never exsperince such a BAD BAD experience before this place. If i had a choice i would not send my child here. But my insurance keeps sending my son here. Since March he has been there three times. First time they rekeased him too early and within 26 hours he had hurt himself like he said he was going to do if released. The second time he came home with a hicky because he wasnt supervised. Not the third time he cut him self, hurt his hand with no medical action after fact.
The staff are rude. Do not communicate. They say they are calling you when they are not. Leave messages with no contact information. Drs give meds to children without athurizing with parents first. When calling in to talk to your child they say they are busy but then child never gets messages and dont call back.
I can go on and on. Three times my son has been here and he gets wrose everytime. They treat the kids like cattle moving them in and pushing them out.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Date>1526072646840</Date>< name>

So as a former patient of the Adolescent Unit in the Psychiatric Hospital I rate the hospital on a scale from 1-10 I rate it a 6. The food was excellent but all the beds in hospital are a POS. The Adolescent unit is VERY different from the Adult units. Lots of problems in the adult units. Booty juiced probably there.

If you're an adolescent hope to go to Fremont. If you're an adult BETTER HOPE YOU DONT GO TO FREMONT!!!</Text>

This place is horrible, I felt my rights as a parent were violated, they broke restraing order rules set forth by the court and all they could day was sorry, 2 visits for my daughter cost over 30k dollars you would think making that much money they could get people to do a better job. I was never asked for an ID I just needed a patient's name to gain access to the child floor. They should be shut down they have violated hippa laws and basically don't care as long as you sign the bill at the end.<//review>

I was a patient at the Freemont Hospital both in and out patient around a year and a half ago. I was in a very bad state then and did not realize that the way I was being treated was simply inhumane. The nurses are in no way trained how to handle patients who are experiencing something as common as anxiety attacks. There were people walking over my body as I lay there having a panic attack. They aren't even trained to be sensitive to patients. I remember hearing a nurse talking about a patient who couldn't understand because of her mental illness and laughing at her. I remember I was there for being suicidal and they handed me an ice pack which said 'poisonous if ingested'. I told them I had some thing I could use to hurt myself with but they didn't even check my room. I ended up ingesting it and when I told them about it, it took forever for them to get an ambulance. By the time I reached the ER the doctor said i would have been dead by that time if I had ingested enough. I should have done something about it then and I regret that I didn't but I swear I will find a way to report it. Patients are at such low points in their life when they end up there and thats how you treat them. It may just be a business for you but these are human lives you are dealing with. They come there when they have tried everything and given up. Thats horrible</text>

Im 14 years old , I thought it would be bad here . I was sent here in march , 2016. The nurses i had were great,  i look at all these comments and disagree with a huge amount of them here and yelp. They usually checked your rooms alot in the night . I felt safe there , didn't have any problems with any other patients , actually made friends. I was there for 2 days , but the downside is ... my doctor didnt help me . Just ask me questions (regular questions like hearing voices whose voice, what do you think we can do to help) and i answered them . And i really did want to leave , but when they didnt do anything,  its been what 2 months now . And i feel much more worse,  but dont get me wrong i loved that place . Except the doctor i had discharged me way to early.  Right when i got out i was on my way home and got some fast food (tasted delicious) and put in my earphones and thought about everything and i told my self everything is going to be okay. And i checked messages from friends etc . They didn't know where i was and were just scared. But i kept thinking. . What did i get out of this ? Friends that can relate to how i feel . Yea ... but i needed or NEED help . And later on i was at home and cried .. later on My mom talked to me like i was baby . Asking me if i needing anything i said im fine , she said how do you feel i said im good . And she would tell me i love you , dont do that to me again etc. I dont want to do that again to her cause she got in alot of arguments with people from there and also a crisis center. But i need help and they just didnt give me the help that i needed . And the visiting hours i liked . Only 45 minutes,  so your family only has enough time to tell you they love you and ask you questions and not yell at you,  but also some people dont get visitors and they dont want people to feel lonely cause no one visits them . I understand that fully . I hear voices,  when i was there , i told my doctor i hear a mans voice , kind of raspy . I didn't know how to explain it . But since that .. all i hear is my OWN voice . Telling me things . I havent heard the man .. i only hear myself saying mean things and i put in my earphones and just try to ignore them . It works sometimes but not all the time. I also cried to much , and recently i can only cry in the night before i sleep . my cries are random . I feel more like i just dont care about anything . School ... i get sent out of classes alot now , referrals, called home . And i get yelled at(of course) And i just dont seem to care as much as i used to.  And also the therapist. . They get annoyed very easily. I was only a level 1 , cause i never did anything in groups. . I just wish i got help , rather than just coping skills . . I guess it depends on the doctor you get.  4 star rating . Nurses 5.  Doctors 0. friends(patients) 5.
Therapist 0. Visiting hours 4. Help needed -10 fun +10</Text>

< Review>
Went here to visit a friend committed to their inpatient program. This place just feels like something that escaped the lunatic asylum shutdown of the late 1900's. The facilities were clean but very old and packed full of negativity, as opposed to a positive environment for people in mental crisis (if I was there longer than a few days I'd need to be on some sort of medication too!). I understand that they are doing what they have to do but they are severely understaffed. The patients are treated somewhat fairly with the limited resources, but there is an overwhelming sense from the Psychiatrists that the patients are all crazy and need to be popping pills (which is definitely not an atmosphere to improve their condition). The goal of this place is to get patients in and out as quickly as possible while providing the minimum level of medical care possible, from overwhelmed Psychiatrists who if the patient is lucky spend 5-10 minutes a day with the patient. Oh and don't bother requesting a call from any of the docs because you won't get one, ever. Which is a testament to the complete lack of professionalism at this institution.

The case manager was pleasant to talk to and was the only one who seemed to have anything under control but ultimately did not facilitate any sort of after treatment outside of looking up outpatient facilities, which could have been done by anyone by spending 30 minutes on Google and Yelp.

In summary: Good quality of care? No. Blatantly Understaffed? Yes. Is that an excuse? Absolutely not.

Avoid this place at all costs.< /Review>

I'm partnered with this store as a music teacher. They have always done right by me, and I will continue to do right by them. I get most of the supplies for my students here, and if they don't have what I need they usually have it very quickly after that. Good people. There are spanish speakers on site if you need that.</Review>

This place reminds me a a family run shop where everyone seems to be in a good mood. This is the ONLY big box store. The employees are friendly, and knowledgeable. And if they don't know an answer, they will find it out for you instead of making something up like the store across the street where every salesman seems to be days away from setting up their own Meth Lab.</Review>

Fantastic selection, and even more so, amazing staff. Specifically, Johan was super knowledgeable about the equipment, and his genuine love and enthusiasm for the craft was infectious. My new Schecter Omen 6 is a joy to play and the fact that I got an in store explanation of how the knobs and amp interplay was very much appreciated. If you are a beginner, novice, or advanced player - you definitely need to check out Harper's.</Review>

I’ve never really left a comment for any store, but the experience I had at this store was phenomenal. I’ve been going to this store for years now. I went there after ordering a microphone and a reverb pedal online earlier today before the store opened. I was so excited that I went to go pick it up as soon as the store opened at 10am before they were finished setting up. I kind of caught them off guard, which I was at fault since I was excited and didn’t give them enough time to get everything ready, but the workers were so friendly and made the whole process run smoothly. Let’s just say I will continue to make this place my “go to place” for anything music related and I will continue to recommend this store to anyone I know!<//review>

Harper's Music is local music store we desperately need.

They carry all kinds of instruments, both new and used, varying from electric, acoustic, and bass guitars, band and orchestral instruments, synths, midis, drums... the list goes on. They have all accessories for said instruments. They also give lessons.

Xavier and Ricardo were both extremely helpful and knowledgeable with what they do, and what matters most is they put the customer first and make sure to meet your needs.

I brought in a flute that had a small sticky key problem, and Xavier patched it up without hesitating. I suppose it was a small fix. Furthermore, he did not charge me anything, probably seeing that he could establish a long-lasting relationship with a customer. This is how you build rapport with a customer! (But don't take this as an excuse to go in there asking for free repairs).

I am the new band instructor for my school and Xavier gave me the rates for both rental and purchasing. They work with schools to figure out better deals and prices for your students. They have a great Rent-to-Own program that you should definitely consider.

I will be doing business with Harper's from now on, as they prioritize serving the community first, no matter the cost and profit. They could nickel and dime us for everything but they don't. Give them your business so they stick around for even longer (they've been around since 1960's.)

Looking forward to working with your business in the future,

Luigi< /review>

I came looking to fix something for my clarinet. I first walked in thinking it only helped string instruments but found out it’s for woodwinds and brass as well. Told me my clarinet had a different problem than what I had thought, fixed it in very little time and was pretty cheap. As long with very easy and helpful service, they also had told us more information as I had questions about another woodwind instrument. Overall, really great service and a definite place to go if you’re thinking for getting an instrument or repairing your own!< /text>

Hi there, I'm writing this review in frustration that one of the employees have damaged my cord. I came in trying to get my headphones for some cash, mind you there professional headphones I had laying around. They were in perfect condition, I barely used them. I was helped by Luigi he was very helpful, me and him talked about the details and everything was great. Even upon testing my headphones Luis said everything was perfect, until one of the employees came and started messing around with the wire, literally, he messed up my wire. Now I said I never had problems before, but my friend also noticed how the employee intention was vague, and we've come a to a conclusion it was his fault my headphones wires where now broken. I'm very upset, I talked to the main boss also, it went one ear and out the other. No type of professionalism and be extra careful of letting touch your intrument.

Edit: It was working just fine even when it was tested THE FIRST TIME, with Luigi, the first employee that helped me. Then the second employee took a hold of it and now magically it stopped working. And no I did not write this review just to be a negative nancy, after leaving from the bad experience i went to another music store with my other cord and wala it works fine. I'm very upset because I barely used them and magically it started being broken when the second employee started touching it.<//review>

Place is calm and perfect for beginners and intermediate players. Great selection for garage / bedroom players. I say that with great respect. Its not a place to get over stimulated by Gibson's, Paul' Reeds and JCM 900s . Great for everyday players. Sells people are informative and helpful.  Didn't feel hounded at all. Shop local. Guys in the scene respect this place.</text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>At first i thought this place was great. I even recommended this place to some of my peers for their rent-to-own program. My girlfriend wanted to learn violin, so she rented a violin from here. The rent to own program automatically adds an extra fee for insurance per month, apparently its not optional, but hey if something were to happen, at least we'd be covered right? WRONG. After just a few months her violin bow broke. It would no longer tighten the bow hair and the knob literally came off. Well, i assumed since we had insurance we could swap it out and that would be the end of that. Well, apparently its not covered under the insurance because its considered "wear and tear". I don't know what kind of cheap violin bows they have, but this is not "wear-and-tear." We came back on a different day, when the manager was available, but he told us the same thing. She ended up buying a new one, but we will no longer be coming here and will definitely warn anyone who wants to purchase anything from here and especially to watch out for the rent-to-own program</Text></record>

After hearing about this place from friends in the Chula Vista area I decided to give it a shot. The staff there were knowledgeable on what they had in stock and were more than happy to spend time answering my questions. Although I didn't buy anything this time it didn't bother them and they were still courteous. I'd recommend this music store for anyone looking for a local flavor and not wanting to go to the big box stores like Guitar Center. Thanks Steve and Mike!< /Text>

I was able to talk to Robert the Store Manager and he was very helpful. I got all the information I needed about renting an instrument. Store was easy to find and packed with instruments of all kinds.< /Review>

I used to go to the Guitar Center until I found Harper's. They have an wide selection of guitars, ukelelis and supplies. What i appreciate is the genuine friendliness and customer service. Ask for Robert.  He's the handsomest one in the store..

Seriously, while waiting they quickly helped students in school band rent their instruments and was able to provided the correct music books needed even tho the parent didnt know what materials their student needed for the class.

I'm glad i found this local store.. Thank you Harper's you rock!</Text>

Love the local shop. It has everything we’ve ever needed. The guy at the counter even gave a recommendation for a chorus pedal, and it’s been on my board ever since.<//Text>

Harry is just an awesome man,
Gave him my Gibson LP, with a broken headstock to repair. Amazing job, left the guitar in great condition. I´d definitely recommend him.<//text>

<review>I came for microphones on sale. I didn't find what I was looking for (which was a cheap microphone maybe in the long run it will be a good thing I didn't find one) the attendant working there was very helpful. He walked me through the different choices and what would be right for me. I left leaving with a blue  snowball microphone so let's hope it turns out good.<//review>< response>

I play guitar and the first time 2 times I went in I was very disappointed by the staff. Person was very aloof and did not want to be the there. My teenage son noticed it also. At the time Best Buy carried music gear and was down the street so if I need picks, strings or guitar cables I went there instead, especially because they were cheaper. I discovered Guitar Exchange in Bonita and went there and for the most part the experience was pleasant. Wanted to have my Guitar setup so I took it to Guitar Exchange and they said bring it back in a week. A week goes by and they are doing inventory and they can't do the setup. Bummed I called Harper's and the setup was half the price and I could take it that day and get it back in 2 hours. So after shopping several music shop I have learned that your experience is random and depends on who is working that day. The last 3 time I have been to Harper's has been great but unfortunately musicians are not known for being the most dependable people and it shows no matter where you go.<//text>

Came in a week ago to have the machine heads on my 20yr old classical guitar replaced, the guys at Harpers were super helpful in explaining the process for repair and getting it fixed in a week. While I was there during my first visit I decided to spoil myself and bought a Manuel Rodriguez classical guitar to keep my Luis Diaz company, now I have two amazing sounding guitars that I can learn again after not picking up a guitar in over 15 years. I'm sure it wont be my last visit to Harpers, they have tons of instruments and audio equipment that I might just go before the end of the year and pick me up a boss rc-505 looper.<//review>

We do get a lot of people that just jam on our inventory and then walk out but that's not an excuse. We still give our customers the option to try anything in our store in hopes they will fall in love with it. What happened yesterday shouldn't of happened and it will be addressed. Next time you are in town please ask for Robert and I will make it up to you."}< /response>

Wouldnt let me play any of the higher end guitars. reason because i havent bought an item...and that I might scratch the guitar. which makes no sense since how can i buy something if i dont know if I'll like it yet. I showed him I had the money for a new guitar. Still wouldnt comply. I went to SamAsh music instead. Bought me a Fender Strat instead of that rugged used  jazz ibanez they had up there for years. Word of advice, be nice to the customers!! you never know who will walk in, could be a grammy award winner guitarist  you just tossed out<//Review>< Rating>

<text>If I could give it no stars, that would be my score. Horrible place to go, plus STEVE is a thief!! I honestly would reccomend any other store, been in the music business for many years and this guy does not know how to run a good "family" bussines. He is just in it for the money and not the music. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. Trust me you'll thank me later.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>They hold my money almost $2K and required my ID, i did it, my ID was verified. I paid for them to authenticate my items and listed it on my closet already. Every my buyers gave me 5 stars rating with sweet reviews without any issues. And now they’ve required me to provide proof of purchase, I did it either but they’re still keeping my money without any response after 3 days. I’m starting to feel scare to do business with this app. Their customer service is terrible, so slow and unhelpful, I called their phone number so many times but no one gets the call. I will never use this app to sell anything else after I get my money from them. That’s so bad and horrible experience 👎🏻<//text></record></dataset><record>

Bought some toys through this site from a seller called EverlysCloset. The toys reeked of smoke but Mercari refused to refund. Then they closed the sale and gave the seller a 5-star review. It is ridiculous. Completely untrustworthy and zero buyer support.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><review>I am a seller and buyer on this app and have been for a year now. If I could rate this app ZERO stars I would. I have had nothing but bad experiences with this company as both seller and buyer. Where do I begin? I got penalized if the buyer cancels and I accept the request, I have gotten flagged for it. I received the wrong item that I purchased and mercari refused to refund me. The last and most irritating thing of all, I shipped an item the BUYER Was aware that I was going to ship the item. After they gave me the ok to ship the item and it was dropped off and marked as shipped mercari allowed the buyer to cancel the transaction. I don’t understand how they could have allowed the cancellation when the item was shipped but it happened. Now I not only lost an item but I also did not get paid. I contacted the carrier to have the package intercepted and they couldn’t help me because the transaction/label was done through mercari and not domestically (by me) at the post office. Therefore deemed ineligible for interception even though the transaction was cancelled BY MERCARI per request of buyer. It is almost impossible to get a hold of someone at mercari I’ve tried email, calling, I’ve only gotten a response through the app basically telling me they couldn’t help me because they couldn’t find the transaction and needed the ID number. When I provided screenshots of everything that included the ID number prior to their response which by the way they reply once a day. I would recommend to stay as far away from this app as possible they do not care about their customers I am beyond disappointed with them they’ve screwed me over enough.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Please be aware of this seller!!! I have met a lot of good sellers on Mercari and I believe I am an honest seller as well. I bought 50 seeds from this seller and what I got is the picture shown. I can’t tell what kind of plant it is but for sure that’s definitely not living stones that she advertised. I tried to contact the seller and found out this seller has blocked me. (Ps:I gave her 5- stars rate because I wasn’t aware this seller is a liar. ) I tried to contact Mercari to see if there is anyway to solve this problem. I submitted requests but never heard back. Just want to warn you. The money is not the big deal, but the time you spend to grow is. I am so disappointed!! Mercari you really should have some sort of customer service.<//Review>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

They have been holding my money for over a week now. In a pandemic. I share bank account with my partner that used mercari before. They said I can't get direct deposit because my account is linked to someone else's. So they told me the only way I could get it was to request instant pay, but my account has been canceled so they said they can't instant pay me if the account isn't active. The only option they gave me was to open another bank account so they can give me my money!!??? Even though I asked them to send me a check since they can't (or won't) use their only two payment options. They haven't replied back. I talked to two different people and none of them were helpful. Their names were Rachel and Xavier.< /text>

Short Answer: Do not use Mercari - I have learned my lesson.

Long Answer: I have used Mercari for about a year.  I have made 23 sales and bought 19 items.  I have 5 stars as both Buyer and Seller. Everything was okay for the past year.  Now, starting in Oct 1 they will taking charging an additional ~4% in extra fees and is no longer a cheaper platform than eBay.  Today, I just made a sale and sent a chat message to the Buyer asking for their phone number as I am shipping item by UPS and a phone number is required.  So to recap, I made a sales already on Mercari and now they deleted my chat message to the buyer stating that "I cannot ask for personal information on their platform".  This is nuts!  I tried to contact Mercari, but there is NO WAY to contact them.  I just de-listed all of my products I was selling.  I won't use thus platform any longer as they do not want quality Sellers with quality items.< /review>

Despite what all the other reviews have said, I love this site and find it so much easier to use than other selling sites. Their free is not as high either. Every time I had issues with a buyer or seller, the customer service team has helped me resolve the issue fairly. I have sold over $2000 with over 160 reviews and never had an issue that couldn't be resolved. Not sure why the other users are having such a bad experience.</Text>

AVOID using this service. I received a damaged item from one of their sellers and contacted both the seller and Mercari for a refund. The seller obliged and said they contacted Mercari for a refund. Then no response and no refund was issued. When I repeatedly contacted Mercari, they gave unreasonable response times and blocked me from contacting the seller further. Now they will not respond for inquiries into this and claim it is resolved (it most definitely is not).

Update 3/2021: Mercari is still denying the return of an item received defective/damaged, claiming that it does not meet the criteria for a return. If a defective item does not fit the criteria, what does??  Honestly, there are other services that respect their buyers better.< /review><user>117496657235472195129<//user>< rating>

Unsatisfied my package was sent to the facility and due to UPS scanned wrong. I purchased Oculus Quest 2. Mercari Is ignoring me and Stealing money from me when its stating for me to rate when the item was delivered to the Ca location which no one is even their to respond to messegess or calls. I am now going to be contacting the CEO for this absurd case. Un Professional and I have been a member for almost a year now.</review>

I was ripped off in a fraudulent situation that was allowed and enforced by Mercari. If you open a support case, the representative will respond (on average 3-5 days later), by copy and pasting a horrible irrelevant "response" with absolutely zero ^$#%'s given about your actual problem, and then close the case so you cannot even respond to it. I have lost over $100 in items and strongly suggest (to any potential users), to avoid at all costs!!! FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

I got Mercari to buy baby clothes for my upcoming baby, and wanted to also get a stroller. My mom wanted to help get us a stroller for our baby stroller, and she is not technically savvy, so we logged into the Mercari account I just set up, we found a stroller, great price, the lady we bought from was super nice, the whole transaction was seamless. I thought it was so nice that I would use Mercari for a lot of purchases in the future.

So why a 1 star review? Because after a few weeks Mercari shuts down my account. No idea why. No data. I tried to log in to find out, and it won’t let me log in. I try to go on their website to communicate with them, they won’t let me unless I log in, but I can’t. I try to find an email, but can’t find one. I try to find a phone number, none listed on their website. I had to google hunt some deep search of random blogs written by random people until I found someone who had procured their phone number. I call the phone number, it is 100% automated - you CANNOT get a live person. But, in that phone number, I got an email address for customer support.

I wrote to customer support, and get an automated answer. I think some live person answered after, but he was so robotic I thought he was a robot answer also (in hindsight I guess it was a human because it was signed by a name). They asked me to verify my identity, which I did, and believe me when I say it was the most secured identity verification process I’ve ever done - I get more identity verification for a simple buying app than I did from any of my $10K+ credit cards or car loans - I mean for real? Face verification, upload drivers license, the whole 9 yards. Meanwhile NO explanation of why my account was closed.

Did they reopen my account? No. Why would they do something to assist a customer who legitimately wanted to buy and sell on their app? I mean, that would make good business sense, and so far they didn’t show any good business sense. What did they do? They sent me ANOTHER email saying I needed to verify my identity. Which I just did. So I did it again. And then I wrote a pretty harsh email saying I’d write a bad review if they didn’t help. They then responded saying that my account was closed because now my MOM needed to verify her identity through the same process, since we used her credit card to buy the baby stroller for my upcoming baby boy’s baby shower!!!! My mom is 70 years old, would not understand why she needed to do that, and it was just a joke.

For real?!?! I can’t believe this company will make it. It is a total waste of time. I suggest using apps or websites that actually give a darn about their customers, like Amazon or Ebay or OfferUp or something. Not Mercari. They are headed the wrong direction.< /Text>

Horrible. Do not order from them. I received a damaged item. The seller didnt respond to me when I reached out. So I opened a PayPal dispute. I got a very stern and rude message from Mecari. Threatening to close my account if I ever opened a PayPal dispute on them again
Do a better job and respond to your customer make sure they receive quality items. Feel free to close my account also. Why would I want to order from them again? Be careful ordering here. They are. NOT super professional or responsive if something is wrong with your order.<//Review>

Mercari in the United States is a scam. Nothing like the original Japanese brand. As soon you make a sale they will "suspend your account" and require more personal information to unlock you account. They have multiple law suits and a pending class action law suit. DO NOT USE OR USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.< /text>

My account is temporarily closed and I need a simple authentication, but it’s such a simple authentication. I have been waiting for more than 10 days, because Mercari does not have a phone that can be used for customer service support or irrelevant calls. I There are still thousands of dollars in funds in my account and I can’t withdraw it. Although I reply to an email, they all respond like robots. I understand that I need to wait during Covid-19, but are you really working after so long? I just want to ask if your Mercari office is open. If it opens, can I drive to you to solve it? If you suspend my account for a long time and my money cannot be withdrawn, how can I solve this? I have been waiting for so long. You always have to give me an answer. If I cannot withdraw the money I earned for a long time, I will ask a lawyer To solve this problem, I would like to ask you to respect the laws and regulations of the United States!<//review>

i bought an artic air ultra and came without the power cord. i sent you a message explaining that i wanted to wait for the person to ship the missing part and to please not close the transaction. 3 days later you still closed it and i lost 40 dollars. i sent you not one, but 2 messages, with no response. i called you and all i can do is leave a message also, i've been calling for three days and its always occupied.. you have a nonexistent customer service but still you are taking 10% of the all the money.<//text>

use other app to buy things!!! the rate on app store is not true because they do not let you leave bad comment. really bad system which only design for sellers, totally not friendly to buyers, they will not let you return items even it’s damage or poor condition . extremely awful shopping experience. Can’t imagine there is good comment exist, maybe by their employees.</review>

I posted 7 items. Shipped two items they arrived and next day I logged in all listings off and asked to verify my ID again after accepted.  You can’t even get a person to respond.  One item was important to me and expensive and now nothing. Unpaid yet no e mail from company to say why. SCAM< /Review>

<time>1589801515974</time><Rate>1</Rate><text>I had purchased a gaming system off of the app and the seller said it was in great working condition. She lied about the shipping and said it was shipped out on 5/6 when she actually shipped it 5/12. I received the system and it was broken with food and rust when you opened it. I contacted Mercari and they said they need to ask the seller for the refund and she denied it. They had HORRIBLE communication and wouldn’t assist. I called my bank and asked to freeze the sale until this was resolved so they deactivated my account for they. The seller still got paid. It seems that they’re okay with scam sellers because they still get money.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>They are awful! Ive has many issues with them in the past but this last one tops everything! My account was suspended for "unusual activity." Of what kind I still 2 weeks later havd no idea! I got a response when trying to simply "like" an item to give their team 24 hours to investigate. 24+ hours go by and I clicked the "learn more" button on this notice that pops up everytime I try to even make a purchase! It says "contact us." I did. waited for 2-3 days with no response & tried again. On the fourth day my inquiry was closed & considered resolved yet I never received a single response. Ive been trying every few days as I cant even take out the $200+ that I'd previously earned and need to have, esp during the pandemic. Their phone # is said to be on the contact page (I read thru the entire terms of service but hitting contact us only takes you in circles. I found a number via Google so I will have to see if it works tomorrow. I am pretty certain it will not. I am also prohibited from messaging anyone. I order an item for over $100 & there is no tracking info or anything. I cannot contact the seller bc of Mercari & Mercari refuses to answer me. I even tried going through other departments to express the severity of the issue & got the same canned response twice! That my issue needed special care & they would fwd my issue to the right people. I got responses from them but no response regarding an item I ordered over two weeks ago & have been patiently waiting for bc I know there is a lot of pressure on USPS right now nor a response on why my privileges were revoked! To be clear ... I was NOT WARNED FOR PROHIBITED CONDUCTVOR SUSPENDED FOR SUCH ... IT WAS UNUSUAL ACTIVITY. ITS BEEN TWO WEEKS AND NOTHING. I just want my money and Im leaving this terrible app!

<review>I have been trying to speak to someone at Mercari for three days. What is wrong with this company. Do they not read all their negative reviews. Are they so hard up for cash that they can't hire customer service reps to answer the phone. Stay away! Use Ebay or Poshmark.</review></record>

I've been a seller on Mercari since 2018 until recently being scammed by Mercari. My item sold and I used the shipping label created by Mercari and somehow my item never reached it destination and was rerouted to where I don't know but what I do know is that there is a scam ring with UPS they created another label with out notifying me, refused to help me locate my item because they created the label through their shipping account, They refuse to file a claim and ups will not allow me to file one either because I am not on they account of Mercari this is shameful and disgusting. Mercari has become a scam artist platform.</Review>

I recently ordered a battery charger for my Craftsman hedge trimmer from these folks. First time order. I received an acknowledgement of my order and said I should receive shipping information within 3 days. After a week without hearing anything I tried to contact them via their website. Every attempt was blocked by a message that connection was not possible. I paid for it via PayPal and decided to wait. After 3 weeks I called their San Francisco office around 3pm Eastern time. Immediately got answering machine requesting info about why I was calling, with details about my order and delays. No reply to my call. The next day I contacted PayPal and challenged the payment and requested their assistance. I received a refund within a couple of hours. Never heard what the problem was from either company. Please trust me - do not waste your time with this company. If they are not fraudulent, they sure act like it.</review>

Mercari, on the other hand, didn’t even try to fault me when a buyer wanted to return something.  They saw it as not that big of a deal, so to keep us both happy, they paid us both!  Those small things make all the difference to me.  Thanks Mercari!</review>< username>

A couple weeks ago I purchased a hearth and hand toy treehouse from a seller on Mercari, it was shipped via UPS with tracking. When it arrived it was just shipping paper and label, the label said it was suppose to be 8 lbs but it definitely wasn’t more than a few ounces.

I contacted the seller and UPS right away. UPS started an investigation and concluded the item was “damaged in transit”
I did not rate the seller as I never received the item and instead contact Mercari support as it says to do in their terms of services.

Mercari refused to issue me a refund in the original form of payment. They only gave me Mercari credit which would expire in 30 days. Mercari said they had no way of knowing what happened to the package therefore they weren’t going to refund me to the original form of payment. I did not want the credit as my husband had already bought another one through EBay the same night that UPS didn’t show up (he wanted to shut me up about it) Mercari did not have another one in stock to just order since they don’t make this specific item anymore.

We have a video home security system and I sent screenshots to Mercari to prove how the UPS driver delivered the package since the UPS investigation wasn’t enough proof.

Luckily the seller had insurance and I was in contact with her throughout on Mercari. She seemed genuinely apologetic about the whole deal and I was wanting to send her all of the evidence of how it was delivered in case she has issues collecting the insurance through UPS ($120 item) but Mercari doesn’t allow images in the messages between seller / buyer.

I ended up making a claim with my bank. As I never received the item I paid for and did not want $120 in Mercari credit which would expire in 30 days as my husband purchased the item elsewhere.

Mercari froze my Mercari account (which has a balance in it from my sales) and refuses to unfreeze my Mercari account until I provide proof that I dropped the claim with my bank. They are holding my balance (which was the money I earned from selling AFTER they took their 10% cut).

I looked Mercari up on the better business bureau and it seems a lot of people have had the same experience as I have. If I had known how much trouble this would be I would have never signed up for Mercari. They take 10% from every transaction and offer no buyer or seller protection.<//Text>

<review>They allowed a return from a buyer who I sold a beautiful Louis Vuitton handbag to. Full description. Fast ship. No issues with the EXPENSIVE handbag. I paid over $20 for the shipping so that it was Priority, insured and required a signature. She claims damage which was a lie. Mercari did not ask me a single question. Buyer damaged my Louis Vuitton, Mercari allowed the return and now the bag is useless. Completely unprofessional. I lost $675, plus $24 shipping. They DO NOT CARE!
Also, they do not know how to authenticate. I have 366 five star ratings and sold over $12,500 for them. God only knows how much I have purchased.<//review>< pics>

Horrible site to buy on. I ordered four pieces of designer jewelry. One had the metal worn off and it was bent and I messaged seller about wear and damage and she said there was none. It was not shown in the photo either.
The other piece was a fake. Neither seller will take back their items and just ignore you. I will never ever shop here again<//text>

Mercari is a safe place to shop. I have had no bad experience with this app. It has been a great experience I would have to say. It is a little different than the other sites in that you order, wait for it to arrive, and if satisfied you rate the seller and then they get paid. If it arrives broken you notify the company, and send several pictures to verify.
The employees at Mercari have always been courteous, helpful, and more than willing to help with whatever you need.
I've never experienced a bad seller there either. Of course, I always treat people the way I want to be treated, and usually, they reciprocate. So give it a whirl, and you'll have a good time!< /review>

I am new there and on my second order shipping out they took my badge away. They have a policy THEY don’t even follow: ship orders out within 24 BUSINESS HOURS!!! Last time I checked that’s Monday to Friday 9a to 5p. My order came in at 12/21/19 at 640p from a Virginia buyer (I’m in Cali mind you). I shipped it out on Monday, 12/23/19 at 5pm. That’s WITHIN the allotted 24 BUSINESS hour time frame. They had the NERVE to remove my “quick shipper” badge for that transaction. Are you flippin’ kidding me? First off, post offices by me weren’t  opened until Monday and I work until 430p. So I let the buyer know exactly when I’d ship and they were fine with it telling me “no rush”. Well I STILL rushed their order and I get “dinged” by Mercari. Shame on you! Plus they’re customer service people reply in a snooty way which tells me there is only   Millennials working there. All I’m saying is improve your app and follow YOUR own rules.</review>

This is the worse selling app. SELLER BEWARE. They are impossible to reach by phone. The send computer generated responses no matter what your issue. It is Monday 10 am. I have been trying to speak with a live person since Friday 7pm which would be 4pm CA time. I mixed up 2 dresses. I wanted to know how to fix it. They kept sending me the same computer messages. Finally both of my customers said that they would switch the dresses if I sent them an envelope. I went to the post office at 745 pm and paid outgoing postage and included postage paid return envelopes along with a pair of stockings for the inconvenience. 2 days later one buyer files for a return. They changed their mind. I can not contact the second buyer because Mercari suspended my account. Now the customer that ordered a $100 dress is keeping the $185 dress. Mercari says that because that transaction is completed they can’t help me but Mercari generates the payment not the customer after three days. Do you think that after I have contacted them twenty times that they would reverse it OR see if the buyer agrees to the additional $85. They have been non-responsive. This company has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced in my life. So I am OUT $85 for a dress PLUS 2x$16.00=$32.00 for postage envelopes prepared with their addresses for the exchange of the dresses. In addition 2x$20=$40 for the stockings. NO PERSON HAS CONTACTED ME DIRECTLY WITH THE FACTS of this issue just automated responses. They are assuming no responsibility. They could have contacted the buyers or given me access to find out what the buyers would do. Even if both chose to return the dresses to me, I could have asked them to return the postage envelopes and stockings. Now I’m just out of pocket. $157!!!!
Do yourself a favor and don’t get involved with this company. They will not provide adequate customer service no matter how many times you call or message. A complete sham outfit.

If I could give negative stars, I would.< /Review>

I purchased a $50 LLR shirt "new with tags." Seller had a previous history of selling items that smelled like cigarette smoke but seller said that was resolved and no  longer an issue. Item arrived while I was out of town. I arrived home 3 days after item was delivered but it was already too late to ask to return item or leave a rating for seller. Mercari had already "completed" transaction. This type of fabric can not be dry cleaned. I am out $50. This will be my first and last purchase thru Mercari.<//review>

<text>Steer clear of these clowns and anybody who sells items there. Had an issue with a shoe size, seller sold me a pair of Nike's made in 2016 as 'new.' Nike's newer Downshifter 6 shoes are a wider fit, though they don't come in a size W. I just purchased a pair last year while in Kuwait, and were perfect. These sent by seller are too narrow and worthless too me.

Seller is ignoring my emails. Mercari  personnel are basically telling me 'tough luck.'

I will never use this Mickey Mouse company again, and will tell everyone I know not to either. Guess I got ripped for $80.<//text><rate>1</rate><Name>mphineas1</Name>< Resp>

Buyer happy to receive their item sooner.  when it came time to pay us, they withheld our shipping charge claiming they paid for the label whether we used it or not. that is a blatant lie, i called fedex just to get confirmation and was told they never bill accounts for any unused labels not scanned accepted.  Mercari then changed their excuse to not pay us what is owed by claiming we marked the box on listing to have them provide a label.  Sellers, you've been warned, watch out for this outfit, this happened on our First Sale and this is the way they treated us! Like I was some noob who'd never sold online.  We've had stores on Amazon and eBay for 5 and 10 yrs respectively.  Mercari had better learn from the leaders quickly or they're headed for class action litigation in the near future.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Time>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>You will contact to the support of Mercari, they will send you a reply by email "send only" address. You wouldn't have any more correspondence, even if you weren't satisfied with their answer.

Mercari is trying to look like they have the support just like other companies however they just send back a copy and paste to our questions which realistically means they are not allowing us to reply to their messages.
Seems like they don’t even have a system as a corporation yet they got to get listed.
Personally I’m not even going to be surprised even if they get into some kind of troubles in near future since their compliance system must be one that’s superficial just to get listed as well.
I just hope the management team is smart enough to know they should not go for something like round trip sanctions against software development using their subsidiaries in a few years where their business goes down.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

1. Buy item
2. Pay for item
3. Wait for item
4. Check tracking and see that the transaction was "cancelled"
5. Attempt to contact Mercari and fail to get a response
6. Write google review and never use Mercari again<//Review>

<Date>1553564701084</Date><rating>1<//rating><text>How to receive FREE items by exploiting negligent Mercari policies!

I used to sell on Mercari with a 5 star rating, until they gave one of my products away. I sold a piece of sports memorabilia that the buyer reported damaged (8x10 protective plexi-glass sheet reportedly cracked). The buyer removed the triple layered protective foam sheets (which was more expensive than the $1 plexiglass sheet), took photos without the protective measures and sent it to Mercari.  Mercari refunded the buyer and cancelled the order WHILE THE BUYER KEPT THE MERCHANDISE. They responded with, "merchandise was insufficiently packaged" and hazardous to return.

I have shipped close to 100 (93 to be exact) of the same type items (all exact same materials/sizes/packaging with zero issues.

So, if you would like to receive items for FREE, remove any protective measures, file a damage claim stating broken glass along with doctored up the photos, and they will take the buyers word and give a 100% refund and let you keep it!

Sad, but true. Sellers beware!</text>< pictures>

My second order, and the second time I didn't receive what I ordered.  In both cases, the sellers sent similar, cheaper items. Buyers have 3 days to let Mercari know  if something's wrong, but like last time, their server is repeatedly busy, and I can't message them or the seller.</Text>

Horrible horrible experience. The kid acting as a manager needs take some management training. I believe his name is Haram he was so rude when I tried and exchanged an item that I was not aware their cashier who had helped me exchanged my item the first time failed to give me(this is because they they are one of the stores that haven't opened  their fitting rooms due to COVID) I had to exchanged my item twice so he tells me in a rude manner and attitude that he can't do anything and that I need to call the customer service number bc they can't locate the original receipt. Was my first time shopping there and will be the last. Remember this kids aren't working there because they have high talents and skill... Oh and yes I will be calling the 800 number and will find out who the regional manager is and he will remember me...<//Review>

Every. Single. Time. I am shopping here there is at least a 4 people in line. Mot of the time It's 7 plus, and checkout takes at least 20-25 minutes. It's 11:09 in the morning (store opened 9 minutes ago), and 8 of the 9 minutes I have spend waiting in line, while the person who happened to be the first is returning full bag of clothes, and the cashier is slowly turning them inside out, folding, and re-tagging them, while having a casual conversation with the guest. So the person in front of me and I are just waiting. And waiting. I am wondering if the manager of this store heard about calling in additional cashiers if the line getting too long? Probably not. I have never seen anything like that at H&M next door, so I am assuming this location is not extra busy.

Update: it took me 23 minutes to purchase one $7.99 tshirt for my son, on Tuesday at 11 am. What a joke. If you value your time, go to the La Jolla location.</text>< Response>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>I love Zara fashion. This store has a wide array of - yet not overwhelming - selections for women, men, and kids. The sale section is the same away. Love that aspect. The only major downside with this store was check-out service: incredibly slow, even when multiple cashiers are available. It seems this is commonplace for Zara locations, and there really is no good excuse for it. You can be neat, thorough, pleasant/cordial and quick regardless of the store or situation - so why is this not happening at Zara? Security tags were still present on multiple items, then when an employee checked my bag, they still left them on. Inconvenient AF.<//Text>< user_name>

Very poor experience. As a Spaniard used to a proper Zara experience, the team working at this location just blew it. Not once but twice.
1st time at the store: massive line to pay or exchange. No other cashier opened at men’s/kid’s... unsuccessful payment with their machines, I request to enter the Visa manually. They call the manager and this youngster has no better answer than telling me that Zara does not take foreign cards????? Tell Amancio Ortega that.
2nd encounter a girl helps me with sizes and offers me to reserve some jeans that are coming on Wed. Came in to the store Wed morning and the staff working there tells me that under no circumstances they reserve items and that they don’t have anything under my name.
Thanks for nothing and wasting my time.<//Review>

<Text>Beware of the restrictive return policies of Zara, always try on their clothes and keep the receipt otherwise you can not exchange for other merchandise even a week later with the tags on!! The manager was unwilling to make an exception even the sweater I got was too big and did not come in smaller size than small.. Fortunately I found my receipt but this time I will stick with the stores that excel on convenience and costumer service.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Love the selection here!  I'm was shocked to see how organized and clean it was during their big sale.  My local store is South Coast plaza in Costa Mesa and I Don't go there during sales because it's like a swamp meet with clothes everywhere.  Thanks for making my shopping experience wonderful!   This store is located in the Carlsbad Mall, the mall itself is getting remodel with most of the stores vacant, but it seems like they're putting in lots if eatery and better stores.  If you're driving by Carlsbad, don't forget to drop by Zara at the mall!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Nice selection, quality clothes. Gave 2 stars, for customer service in Men's department.  Luckily I was there to run back and forth for sizes for my husband. Asked one young man, his response was "I don't know where that item is located". The other was too busy looking at himself in the mirror every chance he got. Once we finished, we had about 7 items, walked up to register to check out. My husband set his things on the far left counter. Mr. I like looking at myself, said "I can help you down here". A register away, doesnt offer to grab anything, how are you, did you find everything alright nothing. My husband grabs everything with one swoop, and drops in front of salesman. Yes, he looked stunned! Cashes us out out with not one word. We wont be back. The young lady on duty was very pleasant.
Too bad, nice store.<//Review>< time>

Why is there ALWAYS A LINE AT THE REGISTERS?  Even when it is slow?  There are always 5-6 people folding, talking, laughing and all looking past the 5 people in line waiting to pay?  Is that how all Zara's operate?  Nice clothes but the priorities at any retail should be customer service, including paying for your purchase!  Let us pay for goodness sakes!</Review>

New shop to north county. It's your basic H&M clothing store with high price tag clothing items that aren't really worth their name brands. The customer service is lacking just like their other stores. Store is well lit and clean though.</review>

This little pool area has several pools, and plenty of areas to set up for your time at poolside. Plenty of umbrellas and chairs, and a little food stand that made some really good food. My burger was on point and the drinks served here were very good. Prices were reasonable, water by cup is complimentary upon request, and the margaritas were so good during the hot day. I was not a fan of the cabanas here, they are very small and packed close to others. The girl who was tending my cabana hardly came by for water refills, and didnt tend to me as much as I would have liked. I tipped 20 off the top and 30 more when she closed my bill and left early, leaving no waters or clean around our area.< /text>

<Text>Fantastic getaway in lovely inland North San Diego. There is lots to do for the kids and adults alike, lounging at the pool, getting snacks and there are activities for all. The pools end  slide are always immaculate  and well-kept. The side closes early though, so be aware. Love Lawrence Welk Resort, a great place for all ages!< /Text>< Date>

There is a nice clubhouse here as well. You can also buy food and drinks at this location (although it's a bit expensive). You can rent a gazebo as well if you're willing to pay for it. They also have wifi available.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

I am a regular at this gas station it very clean and well lit up (safe) compared to others that are near by. I would say it's pricey but gas is pricey everywhere. If you like treats or something to quench your thirst they have plenty and always have deal, Good place to fill up< /review>

NEVER AGAIN. Entered at 3pm today to grab a quick bottle of water with my 10lb service animal in my arms. Was yelled at and told to leave immediately by a mid 20's staff member with a name tag that read Judith but said her name was Christina when quieried. Note they have a walk-up window, but instead of kindly offering a solution to complete my transaction via the window, she instead fired off one comment after the next with absolutely no consideration for my "situation". I explained that it was nearly 100 degrees and it wasn't possible for me to leave the dog in the car. I explained that I simply needed a quick moment to complete my transaction. She refused. When I asked if she always treated people with service animals this way, she told me it was my fault because I didn't explain myself. She begrudgingly agreed to ring me up while continuing to fire off sharp and disrespectful commentary.  Keep in mind, at entry I wasn't asked..... she simply began yelling at me from behind the counter. She went on to tell me I should have tied the dog up outside. I expressed to her that there wasn't a suitable place to do so within view of the check-out counter and a small sized dog is easily capable of being taken. She then told me that was rediculous and expressed ZERO regard for me as a customer or an individual.  I'm a working professional, polite, and engaging with nearly everyone I encounter.  Thankfully I'm not routinely treated this way, but what I experienced today was downright harassment, verbally abusive in tone, approach, and bias. Service personnel who behave like this are why we're in a culture where people feel compelled to video disparaging and disrespectful treatment. It's wrong and it shouldn't be happening, period. It's easy to provide good customer service in nearly every situation, even when you feel a customer is doing something you think they shouldn't. I can respect whatever policy has been dictated to this employee, but use common sense and offer sensible solutions to someone who's just trying to spend money at your place of employment. I will be following up with the Chevron Corp regarding my experience at this franchise. Personnel should at minimum be transparent in identifying themselves, especially if they're going to specifically use another person's name tag and or identity to avoid accountabilty for bad behaviour. I wouldn't tolerate being spoken to this way by a stranger on the street let alone by a person representing a place of business.< /review>

They blast non-stop advertisements at you while you're pumping gas. Very annoying. I won't be back here.< /Review>

My friend wanted a fried chicken sandwich and we found Dave's on a Sunday night. I love the menu options and the number of heat levels there are. I got a medium and my friend got a hot tender and extra hot sandwich. The  chicken was really good with the medium having a decent amount of heat to it. There was a short line at the time we went which was much longer when we were leaving but it was definitely worth.</text>

One of the most delicious sushi experiences we've ever had. Nestled in between pubs & bike tour shops on Hyde St, this place is a little hidden gem. If we're ever in SF again, we'll definitely visit Grandeho's again!< /Review>

This place is awesome! Great food. Awesome service. Cool atmosphere. They get it. Although it's not huge inside, this place is doing things right. I'd recommend them to anyone who is wanting sushi near fisherman's wharf.</review>

<time>1561526063537<//time><rate>5< /rate><text>A long-time neighborhood gem, Grandeho's is one of those rare places where the food, personal service and ambiance all stand out... Nothing fancy, but the quality of the food always brings us back.  Featuring a variety of Asian food such as fresh sushi, seafood, noodles, etc.  The owner is a local resident and it's obvious this restaurant is a part of her family, and the hospitality always shines through.  Prices are a little on the high side, but the quality of the food is worth it.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQT6B0MjKXp3Xle-8Fg6A51CCIzNB4IZsjLPk7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOthhfa337SwTyhc6j9YUnX4bzCNolGCU3uEaC0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIbEUzaDjUMLmqRIhVDlFVsXKopMozegZjxtk1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg9mC6jf0hpyu5vdLh4mlJdIOBfQf26NTtOfzc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1aaMWFapEtpWwK6i3oUSduS-yR-9PBHdtsAtz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvxHvRnJWf1zCTDOAva0XR9BcVNw53fyeP3lk5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiht-vmXRqrSdCFpOSU6sz6chhbf1hefp-uu9F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWu-0cKt_w2CvNp2u0N_csaaFjMBsJHApiOHH9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0ZnG8UcJ1LYSsBJdUR8MMzITOAwxjA9I-nMcq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsBouvDtlZqqcYqSW1Ods-tpOxXStqZX1oLX2J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb2JjqL3hmZQ6ysFSmtU7Wnr5lEjVLtM05cmMm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG0aybj0BU0HW8oBNz1lypH_vYIvjehID5FXMd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808580e13cd891e9:0x8ef2442c19df560c<//gmap_id></record>

I had the basic California roll (I'm not big in sushi) and shrimp tempura. It was delish, but the customer service is what earned the 5 stars!</Review>

Fantastic sushi restaurant, vast menu, so many options, just too much to choose from. The combo dishes and rainbow rolls give you lots of fish to try. Grab a seat at the bar and watch your dinner carefully prepared in front of you.</review>

<review>We went there on Saturday around 3 pm. Service was ok. We ordered several rolls. There was a parasite on the Yellow Tail Tuna. We took several pictures. We did not say anything to them and we left after paying. My daughter’s husband is a Sushi Chef and he confirmed it was a parasite. Parasites in fish can make humans really sick. It is unacceptable !!!!<//review><Response>None< /Response><Rating>1</Rating>< GmapID>

First time here. I've been searching for decent sushi in the area for over a year, and finally I find it. Honestly the best sushi in the city. Great service as well. I had a bento box with salmon skin roll (amazing) and salted mackerel (even better) and veggie egg rolls, also sublime.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>A true gem in the Wharf district of San Francisco.

My wife and I love to find small local places to dine when we travel, and the hotel concierge suggested this unassuming eatery for "really good sushi".   Grandeho's Kamekyo did not disappoint.  It's not cheap, but the rolls were fresh and service was prompt. Everything we wanted from a casual night out.

There are "hipper" places, and if that's your thing, you might be disappointed.  That's definitely not my thing, though, and it was an easy 2 block walk from our hotel located almost on top of Fisherman's Wharf.

It's worth noting that they do NOT participate in Monterrey Bay Aquarium's "seafood watch" program, so you can get some fish there that are on the "avoid" list.  This is probably no surprise to folks who know about the relationship of the Japanese to Pacific Ocean fishing, but if that's not a problem for you, it was an amazing evening.  If it *is* a problem for you, you can always take the SeaFood Watch app with you and refrain from ordering those items.

Overall, we had a wonderful evening of fresh fish.  I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area and in search of great sushi.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808580e13cd891e9:0x8ef2442c19df560c<//GmapID></record>

I don't like they abuse of the customer trust. The final bill includes the tip, which is 18%.
There is a sign at the entrance with low size showing you they will charge the tips. Obviously you will read it (if you have very good vision and you focus to these area) when you finish.
Plates are good but prices are high. And, as I said previously, you will get a big surprise when the ticket comes to your table.
I'm sure I'll never come back here.</Text>

<review>This place is a find.  A well-rounded menu that happened to have fatty tuna on special when I went.  Wide selection that makes me want to come back for a lot more. Not far from the tourist trap nearby but the locals dine there.  Catch that classic San Francisco vibe with cable cars going by the door and a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge just down the street.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808580e13cd891e9:0x8ef2442c19df560c</gmapID></record>

They're bulgogi is absolutely amazing! The most delicious Asian comfort food I've had in a long time. Everything had amazing flavor and the beef was perfectly cooked and falling apart. Now I need to go back and go to bed! Exactly what I needed after a long day in airports and walking around the city.</text>

After a long day of driving from San Diego, we ended up here. It was absolutely delicious, probably the freshest sushi ive ever had. We had the rainbow plate, oven baked salmon rolls, miso soup, and some local beer. It was soo good. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Small place but I like the cozier environment. Highly recommend!</text>

I went here while I was on a choir trip and it was amazing. The service was very kind and welcoming to me and my three friends and treated us better than any sushi place I’ve been to. Our waiter was very friendly and talked to us about our trip. The Philadelphia roll is one of the best I’ve had in a while. Overall it was Ana amazing experience. Next time I am in San Francisco I will definitely be returning.<//Text>

Well presented restaurant, with helpful friendly service. Prices seemed to be a bit higher than we generally pay around town, but given the location, that's to be expected. On top of the pricing was a fixed 18% gratuity for all parties, regardless of size. Serving sizes were generous, including the rolls. They were well prepared for, and extremely accommodating with young kids, which was a delightful and much appreciated surprise!< /Review>

Superfresh sushi made in a delicate way. A bit pricy though but 5 stars for that. But I sat at the bar and I had to hear the sound of 3 different tv screens with different channels (the one at the dinning room, the one at the bar, and the one the cook had one). Not a pleasant experience. The manager should take that into account.<//text>

<Date>1523252756958< /Date><Text>Wonderful little restaurant with very attentive wait staff and chef.  Our waitress made some wonderful recommendations and we left very full and happy.

Fish was all very fresh, with nice size portions and attention was prompt.  My wife and I had our youngest child with us and they took good care of him too.

Prices are what you would expect to pay for this area, and the quality justifies the cost.

We will absolutely be back!</Text><gmap_id>0x808580e13cd891e9:0x8ef2442c19df560c</gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><username>Nv_ Spider</username><user>116460974448674433624<//user>< Rating>

This place is among the top 5 sushi place I've been to.  The interior is completely Japanese and the service was great.

I sat at the bar and watched the chef sculpt each piece of fish with great care and put thought into aligning every element that was presented.  The place is on the spendy side, so come when you really want to indulge!< /text>

Probably one of the best sushi restaurants you can find outside of Japan; for that reason, expect a wait! The fish taste very fresh and well chosen. The Uni, was the only item of our choices which could have been better. The Tempora is phenomenal and the Miso Soups (both regular and with mushroom) were delicious.</text>

<time>1535332714654</time><Text>Only okay quality sushi. Prices were a little expensive. We ordered 4 different rolls, the cherry bomb, spider roll, Seattle roll and chef's special roll. The raw fish quality was only so so. Chef's special was a mish mash of raw fish and vegetables garnished with some deep fried vermicelli. Looked kind of like a grade school art project. The flavors were not complimentary.

The restaurant is very interestingly decorated, to say the least. Korean, Japanese, Chinese accents with year round Christmas decor.</Text><username>Vicky Vuong< /username>< user_id>

Ordered: the 2 items bento box ($18.95) and the Kimchi Udon ($15.95), both very filling. Nice selection of options to choose from for the bento box, and it came with - salad which was tasty and had fresh fruit bits, white rice and two smaller sides (top left in bento box photo). Prices are a bit expensive, but that's SF for you. Service was great, and staff super friendly.< /text>

They don't just serve the nigiri as just rice and fish, but go a little beyond by applying sauce and garnishes. Service is good and menu is simple.

The only thing that made me dock a star is their practice of including gratuity for all party sizes and unusually high prices for what you're getting</text><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Great atmosphere, we felt as if we were part of the family. Prices were reasonable given the location. We ordered a boat and weren't disappointed! The fish was sliced quite thick and was very tasty. After dinner we were served a complementary organic fruit plate that was beautifully presented.< /text>

Amazing Asian food - if you look for a great place to eat around Hyde Street, stop by Grandeho's Kamekyo - awesome makis, great teriyaki,tasty fried rice and friendly, homely staff. Our best restaurant in California in a 2 weeks trip. As Arnold would say, I'll be back!</text>

Servers were so kind to us and our kids even though I always cringe when taking the 2 year old to any public place. They were helpful and the sushi was excellent! We ordered Won Ton’s & Bento Box for the kids and the Rainbow, Cable Car (amazing!), Dynamite, and Cali roll for the family. All was delivered in appropriate timing giving us time to eat each course and help the kids eat. Atmosphere was great and lots of locals showed up as well so you know it’s a known place considering all the options around town. Prices were very reasonable unlike many of the touristy spots in the area that gouge you for sub par meals and experiences.</review>< Pictures>

Very average fish quality and very expensive for average fish quality. I had Sake (salmon), Hamachi, Saba and Ikura.
Bottom line, I would not come back with so many other options in SF.< /text>

I would categorise this restaurant: "fusion" rather than Japanese.
I ordered teriyaki salmon, it felt like American salmon steak and gyoza was similar to a Korean styled dumpling.
The impression was interesting, however taste was great!< /Review>

<Review>It's a little small and slightly pricey, but very good food & service. I recommend the Chef's special and let him create a sushi roll based on your taste preferences.< /Review>< pictures>

I was just suspecting it is owned by Chinese when I saw those Chinese calligraphy on the wall, then I saw the cabbage(or Chinese cabbage) on top of ramen, I was 100% sure😑... a little overpriced, tasted Okay though.</text>< pics>

Stayed 2 nights in San Francisco and decided to try this place out on our first night , we liked it so much we came back the 2nd night . They are so incredibly welcoming , the food is so fresh, tried catering to our picky son , and on top of it they have us "on the house* appetizers, soup and salad. Wonderful, food , atmosphere and  people. Please try this place out , I can't say enough good things about it .</text>

<review>When we went, whoever makes half of the advertised specialty drinks was not there, so we could not order them.  We didn't find this out until after we were seated.  Also, they forgot to put the meat in our ramen, and when they brought it out later to fix the issue, the meat was cold.  Finally, the food was just average.  Nothing really to write home about.  We didn't like the taste, but the quality was still okay.  All these things together, though, make it 2/5.<//review>< Pics>

Casual mom-and-pop sushi place with friendly service and fresh fish. The wife and I ordered Sushi Boat A ($60), which was the perfect amount of sushi for the both of us. Fresh, good quality fish, and the boat had a great mix of rolls v. sushi v. sashimi. They also brought out a few small complimentary side dishes for us (kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, etc.) while the sushi was being prepared, which was a welcome surprise. We came at 2PM on a Tuesday and there was only one other table occupied, which made for a nice quiet, peaceful meal. Will come back here next time I'm in the Fisherman's Wharf area!</text>

< Review>
The staff at Grandeho's Kamekyo is very kind and attentive. The prices are fair and the food is fresh!
I stopped in to eat dinner on my own and the restaurant wasn't particularly busy but they just started working on a large order for a big party. The server got me started on soup, communicated that it may be a few minutes for my entree, but quickly fulfilled my nigiri order even though the sushi chef was very busy.
The salmon nigiri is a larger portion of salmon than I've been used to and the scallops were amazingly fresh.
I definitely plan to make this a regular stop!<//Review>

Exceptional sushi experience! We ordered a couple of rolls, sushi, and the chef special sashimi platter. Sushi Chef David did not disappoint. The quality of the sashimi was perfect.  We even received a few surprise bonus pieces.  We will definitely return and refer friends.</review>

<Text>I busted San FrAn from NY and I am still craving the bowl they served me.The food was pretty good but the reason I’ll give it 5 stars is bc of the service.There were 2 ladies an older (60/70s) and a younger one(around 40s) in which the younger lady treated me like family.The food was really good but the service made the experience well worth it.The food tasted fresh and was a reliever to my stomach after eating so much heavy food for the last couple days.I’m not master of eating with chopsticks so the lady (40s) gave me a training wheels one which was very cool and we got complementary fruits at the end.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>The food was ok for the price. We ordered iced tea and never got it. They kept bringing us a ton of small plates with everything we ordered when we already had plates, causing our table to fill up pretty fast. All of our food came at different times, with up to 10 mins between first and last person receiving their food.</text>< pictures>

Wow, I was just in the area and felt like some comforts of Japanese cuisine, walked in and sat at the bar for an amazing omakase (chefs choice) from chef Tran, who displayed a beautiful spread of sashimi and nigiri that tantalized my taste buds. The lovely servers made sure my beer and sake needs were met to the utmost.

All around a 5 Star Japanese cusine experience.

I recommend this hidden gem to any and everyone from this meal on!

not the best, but good.

the service was lacking.

they raped us on gratuity.

$48 bill = $10 gratuity added in.
total bill= $58

$15 bill = $5 gratuity
total bill = $20

won't go back.

We got 2 rolls of sushi--the Cherry Blossom Roll (salmon, cucumber, avocado and tuna) and the Bay Roll (scallop, crab meat, wasabi sauce, salmon and lemon). Both were delicious! I took off the lemon rinds that were on mine but it didn't take away any of the lemon flavor. I loooved the sushi! The chicken teriyaki was good. The tofu teriyaki was, according to my mom, "excellent," and she doesn't use that word to describe food often. My parents also ordered the tofu soup, which they said was good, but we were so full at that point that they could only eat one bite!

My family absolutely loved this restaurant, we ended up going twice! We felt very taken care of and well attended to. We celebrated our parents' anniversary the second time we went and they gave us a super cute fruit plate with little cubes of oranges and a really amazing duck made out of an apple! This place is wonderful and we highly recommend it.< /text>

The grilled meat is delicious. The shop staff is also kind.

여행 중 한식 생각나서 찾아보다 가게 됐는데 직접 담근 김치가 맛있었어요 순두부를 스파이시로 시켰지만 전혀 맵지 않았고 전통 한식맛은 아니지만 재료가 신선하고 많이 들어있어서 좋았어요 회덮밥도 맛있었구요 직원분도 친절하셨어요<//Text>< Name>

(Translated by Google) Great food & service! Must go if you’re in this area.
It's run by Koreans, so they give you kimchi as a side dish and salmon kimbap as an additional service. The sashimi is also fresh and very friendly. I will have to stop by the next time I come.

한국사람이 운영하는 곳이라 김치 밑반찬 섭스로 주시고 연어김밥도 추가서비스로 주시네요. 회도 신선하고 굉장히 친절합니다. 다음에 오게되면 또 들러야 겠네요.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a treasure spot that I found while trying to find a restaurant, but I was closed on Sunday because I was so hungry that I was closed on Sunday. I know you're Korean, and you gave me more rice and it was kind and nice. It is also delicious. I was the one who didn't know why I came to the United States to find Korean food, but I was really impressed because I ate rice after eating only flour. Please flourish ~ ^^

원래 맛집 찾으러 가려다 일요일 휴무인거 알고 허탈한 마음으로 배가 너무 고파서 숙소 근처로 알아보다가 발견한 보물같은 곳입니다. 한국인인거 아시고 밥도 더 많이 주시고 넘 친절하고 좋았어요. 맛도 있구요. 미국까지 와서 한국음식 왜 찾는지 모르겠는 1인이 저였는데 느끼한거랑 밀가루만 먹다가 쌀을 먹으니 정말 감동이였습니다. 번성하세요~^^</text>

The water was COLD today, but it was nice.
And it was great to be able to get down to the water so easily here.<//Text>

There’s a mini beach that is an awesome place to hang out as well as a ton of rocks to jump off of into the water. The water is also super clear and warm during the summer.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9-1UsHiHbQ1i2cUUJZtr-kpfcwT_EHPBgoeA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBwa2vBrMKKFPzeVihR8rM_u5mEkZNpg0BO24=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm7gPdP_gH6YTz00gUiCxT5iTuVgNBkpIi0CE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvutbvsHxDSsuigBsoO4UCc645pnFCWB2PDEI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO70_tLK6BYeTsvbX6r3694NTpSeiSi_Cq0Rf0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWQB5GdJfkkZ9TZN0l9ojYYLEiYPCxa5avVIU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8lO5lK4b4C-wRD2OOGmlWxS_9uRTEnob-uk8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x54d06bb6fccc3bc3:0xfceb0a0e0f03ecd7< /Gmap_id></record>

Beautiful place! And the water color makes it more beautiful Though the water was bit cold, it was good to swim.
We spotted couple of small (less than 2ft) water snakes which were eating fishes on the shore.< /Review>

<Text>This place is an oasis in one of California’s most beautiful regions. While you’re 5-10 minutes from the city, shops and restaurants, you feel like you’re in a remote country getaway. The terraces open up to fresh wooded air, quiet, and beautiful gardens with swans and flowing creek. It’s something quite magical. The rooms are modern and the staff is off the charts helpful and friendly. I came here to do a stop over from a road Trip and brought my bike with me. There are some great rides along Mulholland Dr, through the canyons, Griffith Park and Santa Monica beachside ride. So if you like the outdoors, this is yet another reason to stay here. It’s my favorite  destination in California along with the Ritz Carlton in Santa Barbara.</Text><rate>5</rate>< UserId.>

This property has just been renovated so you'll enjoy beautiful rooms and nice comfy bathrooms with a separate shower. I like the bar staff and the outdoor area is nice to sip a drink or have a cup of coffee.
I liked the spa which is located next to the gym. Service in the hotel is up to the "Hotel Bel-Air standard" with all staff being very attentive and gracious.The cafe in the hotel (not Noe) is not so great. I had a casear salad with green chili sauce--it wasn't pleasant.</Review>

<review>staff here was really great. above and beyond in terms of friendliness and eagerness to help. from the valet to the bellhop to the front desk guy--each person provided stellar service. I'd stay here again. but watch out parking is $48--although that's comparable to the lots in the area.</review>< Pics>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Our second visit was flawless (I said in my last review that this was a place you'd want to come back to again and I meant it). The HBA doesn't rely on flash and superficial luxury to impress. Superb comfort, attention to detail, and quality of service is what sets it apart. The staff is truly the best I've seen in all my travels and you can feel they enjoy and have a genuine pride in managing their guests. Even though it's exactly what we came for, still amazed again by how private the property is despite being a quick drive from all that LA has to offer.If you've never stayed at the HBA, do yourself a favor and try it at least once, and I guarantee you'll want to come back. If you've been here before, enough said, you know what I mean.</Review><Name>Expedia reviewer< /Name><time>1597017600000< /time></record>

<user_name>Expedia reviewer<//user_name><pics>None<//pics><text>The Hotel Bel-Air is a rarity in LA where most 5-star hotels offer friendly but casual (ie loose) service. The HBA staff is top quality and ride the fine line between friendly and formal with aplomb. The atmosphere, rooms, and facilities are the most private you'll find in LA without having to drive hours out of the city. The menus for the restaurant and in-room dining don't seem all the special at first glance but each seemingly regular item is prepared to perfection. This is not your standard hip and stylish LA 5-star boutique hotel. The HBA exudes comfort and class and makes you feel like you're on vacation at a resort. A true getaway in the city, this is a place you'll want to come again and again... and again.< /text>< Gmap_id>

A magical place full of old lore and legend. It was here two years before BH even became a city. When it comes to reliving the past glory days of Old Hollywood, this is as close as you will come. The staff here is impeccable and do not put on any airs. They even parked our Cadillac and Camaro right up front with the Rolls and Bentleys. When you stay or visit THE Beverly Hills you too become part of the story and the tradition.

This courtyard motel has the colorful and quiet charm of a tropical getaway right in LA. The staff and room are super dog friendly. The room was clean and private with secure courtyard parking right off Washington Blvd, very close to the Marina and downtown. The cafe has a great menu with good coffee and the owners (managers?) are very friendly and respectful. Very clean rooms with a nice breakfast nook and small kitchenette.
I spent the New Year with my Labrador Pele. She mostly slept and comfortably spent some of her final days here.< /text>

<review>Absolutely fantastic! My husband and I booked this last minute after a very stressful travel day and within minutes of walking in, we were upgraded to a nicer room and given a complimentary bottle of wine since we had missed their "sipping hour"! The customer service from Jared was outstanding! The room is beautifully decorated and the bed is very comfortable!</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2bcf12bd777e1:0x8f0e72ca4c31466d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

He was very understanding and apologetic, which I appreciated.
He refunded half our money, and gave me two free nights in one of their large suites, free of charge.
These gestures were appreciated, and thoughtful. When a business takes responsibility and does what they can to make things right, I have much respect and grateful for that.
One star off for the first bad experience.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2bcf12bd777e1:0x8f0e72ca4c31466d</GmapID>< UserId.>

<Review>Had an absolutely wonderful stay here. Though it was too brief, had a great night sleep and two of the best meals I’ve had at any hotel, anywhere in the world.
The room was clean and quiet. The outdoor fireplace and hot tub/pool was very relaxing at the end of a couple long days.
Every single staff member was helpful and courteous. Hope to make it back someday and looking forward to checking out their other properties on my travels.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2bcf12bd777e1:0x8f0e72ca4c31466d<//GmapID>< date>

Me and my boyfriend Cameron went. And we loved it. The pool, hot tub and spa was relaxing. The wine and beer at Bar 19 was amazing and good. The Polo Lounge food was really good and the servers were really nice. The rooms were nice and clean and modern. And we had fun at the tennis court<3 Definitely recommend and coming back soon< /text>

Another plus, we were driven in their courtesy vehicle which is a Rolls Royce ghost.  Never in my life did I feel pampered and special, during my stay at this Four Seasons location. What a memorable stay!!

Overall, it's worth every penny to stay here, as pricey as it is, it's a great treat if you're on a budget.

Absolutely, I will be back, and for an LA area hotel, this is the place to stay.  Enough said....<//Text>

I have stayed at luxury hotels all over the world, in terms of service and hospitality, nothing comes anywhere close to the Beverly Hills Hotel. I would go back to LA just to stay there. I highly recommend the bungalow experience - grab a bottle of champagne, light the wood burning fireplace, put your feet up and stay in for the night.  Thank you to all of the fantastic crew that make this hotel great!!</Text>

Came here for a charity event and was very impressed with the hotel. Incredibly friendly staff and beautiful decor. Excellent location close to Beverly Hills and West Hollywood.
Valet parking took a while to get the cars as it was a big event and they were super busy.< /Text>

<text>Extremely polite and professional staff. Smooth check-in and check out. Could maybe figure out a mobile check out. Couldn’t take advantage of the spa or gym because of COVID-19 restrictions. Next time. Had one dirty coffee cup by the pool which we asked to be changed for a clean one.<//text>< Pics>

Outstanding hotel and service! My family comes to LA to visit and they always choose this hotel. They have tried others but this is by far the best! We love the old world charm mixed with the modern! The service, beauty and location is outstanding!</text>

Beautiful hotel centrally located in downtown LA. Our stay started out a bit rocky, but the customer service more than made up for it. All it took was one call, and Toi absolutely took care of us. Management should take note, Toi exemplifies what customer service should be, and we truly appreciate her effort. She went above and beyond to rectify the issue, and that made all of the difference. Thanks, Toi!</review>

<text>The Beverly Hills Hotel is such a wonderful little place!   It is so clean it's amazing!   Super comfortable everything!  Kitchenette w fridge, microwave and coffee maker and all the supplies. I was here for the second time, but this time during the pandemic.  I would go NOWHERE else during this time.  I knew from my first visit how impeccably clean they are, so I wasn't worried.  I'm sure they added extra precautions, it smelled so clean and taken care of.  But it did before too.  Fatima is a total gem!  Her husband too!   They go out of their way for your comfort and safety.  Love them, their Villa and all that they do!  Oh!  Their cafe with home cooked amazing meals is the icing on the cake.  The food is wonderful!  And well worth every penny!   Delivered right to your room!   Thank you Fatima and team!<//text>< Resp>

Cute place and very quaint. Friendly staff. Nice owners who helped us when my mother booked a room for three of us and she didn't have a place for her medical device. So they were very accommodating and understood.</Review>

<text>Amazing. Low key elegance. The hotel itself is just incredible, the rooms are large and comfortable. For drinks head over to Nineteen, the bar. For food and drinks, the Polo Lounge is historic. The grounds are just all Palm trees and the tropical foliage is just perfect. I love this place. A true oasis in the city.< /text></record>

<Text>What a joy.  My wife and I are wrapping up a five night stay in this dreamboat place. When we were here, the bustle of LA disappeared.  This is a very special place.  The rooms aren't large, but they are immaculate.  I don't know how I'll wrap up the day without a passionfruit mousse -- the restaurant is also adorable< /Text>< Pictures>

I thought there might be something rather pleasant about taking morning tea at the Four Seasons. I even dressed up for the occasion, because you want to look your best in a swanky place like this. where the crowd's sure to be classy.< /review>

This place is amazing, a real hidden gem.  Everyone is super nice and it has an amazing atmosphere.  The rooms are a bit small, but very clean and suitable.  Nice bathroom, HD flatscreen, mini fridge, desk, and breakfast bar.  There are also little hang out spots outside your rooms.  They have chairs and tables to lounge at.  There is also an awesome cafe as well.

Overall, it's cheap, great people and service and more than fairly priced.  STAY HERE, you will be satisfied.< /review>

We stayed here for four days. Its part of the Dorchester hotels and as expected it was just wonderful staying here. Everything about our room (it was a large bungalow) and locations was fabulous. The kids also loved it, especially the pool.< /text>

I love this place! I stumbled upon it by blind luck during a visit to west LA. I had been very dissatisfied with the options on the big travel sites. It was very expensive (roughly $120+) to stay at the main hotel chains, and apparently they aren't even that great. So, stuck in traffic on the 405 near Culver City I'm checking Yelp for what other options I have close by. Villa Brasil popped up and they had great reviews. Out of sheer curiosity I stopped by to take a look. It was $85 a night that weekend and I asked if I could preview the room. The manager was very nice and agreed without hesitation.<//text>

<Review>There are many choices for luxury hotels in this area. We HIGHLY recommend The Beverly Hills Hotel because of Momodou at the front desk.

An absolutely beautiful property (in the land of many beautiful, famous hotels), but it's the service that makes The Beverly Hills Hotel stand out.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Attempted to attend the holiday market, but they were immediately at capacity. They didn't have the parking capacity or adequate manpower to inform the endless line of cars that they wouldn't be allowed in. Looked like the attendants were selectively allowing cars in. This event should consider  utilizing a shuttle service and partner with a nearby school for additional parking. Was really hoping to enjoy the hotel and this beautiful event.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Got a room for $189 on Trivago.com.  It was well worth it.  I would have gladly paid up to $290 a night.  Accommodations were five star.  Its my go to spot when I'm in town again on business or visiting the gentlemen.<//Text>

While I was perfectly happy with almost everything at the Four Seasons, I regret that it wasn't a little grander in ways that are fitting, firstly for a prestigious hotel in Beverly Hills, and secondly for the outfit I was wearing. Would it be too much trouble to introduce a designated dress code? Then I wouldn't have to stare at someone else's bare hairy thighs while I'm eating. Of course, my raised expectations are not the management's fault. Nonetheless, I'm deducting one star - and one entire Season - for this.< /review>

My favorite hotel to stay at if the wife and I want a night a way from the kids. They are scrupulous in regards to cleaning and the breakfast is to die for. Truly a fantastic establishment.<//Text>

Hotel Bel air is in a beautiful canyon and the Christmas lights with the other decor give you a great holiday spirit. The garden vegetation along with the pond and swans give you a serene feeling of being in paradise. The rooms are clean and tranquil. The masseuses were excellent and a must to add to a wonderful experience!< /Text>

I am not sure why this hotel only has three stars. I was a little skeptical because of the bad reviews but boy was I wrong. Me and my girlfriend got a three night stay through Priceline. The people in the front counter were very nice. The valets were nice people as well. We order r food one night through Uber eats and we're not provided utensils in our bag. Luckily, a very nice elderly security guard came up to the fourth floor and provided us with silverware, that was going above and beyond and I greatly appreciate that. I would not mind staying here again. Thank you The Beverly Hills Hotel</review>

Overall great stay and would recommend. Great customer service from front desk, valet and housekeeping. One thing I wished there were more towel racks in the washroom but the drinkable filtered water fountain in the washroom which was a great touch.<//review>

This is my favorite hotel in Los Angeles. Tucked into a wooded canyon in the exclusive Bel Air neighborhood.  It's a small five star property offering suite-like accommodations at a premium price.  It offers an upscale restaurant, bar catering, room service, concierge services, car and driver, business center. When l was there it was b owned by Rose which also operates the Ranch at Hana on Maui, the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, and the Remington in Houston.  All of which are extremely plush, highly rated hotels and offer only the finest accommodations and service.  The Bel Air is also one of the most desired place outside Mañibu to have your wedding and reception. Outstanding property,and if $700 a night and up is in your budget this is where to stay.< /text>

The room was average size, but had everything I needed. Wall-mounted TV, wi-fi, clean bathroom and shower, heater/AC, refrigerator, microwave, kitchen sink. It was very clean. My bed happened to be pink, which was interesting...and my bedside lamp was pink as well...hmmm...

Parking was great, atmosphere was pleasant and most of the people staying there seemed to be older. Overall a very charming place and great place to spend the night. Very conveniently located too, it's right off the 405 and really close to all of West LA.<//text>

Clean, attentive to details which is what you expect here, and it is what you get. I have been coming here for many years. It is nice to see people that I have gotten to know over the years. The Fountain shop, Polo Lounge, are excellent. Worth noting- the CONCIERGE are the BEST. They do their homework, know the area. Great ideas to plan out your day, any sites, restaurants, or simply very trustworthy. If I got lost, they stayed on the cell until I was at my site, or safely back at the hotel. Having stayed at other supposed 5 star hotels, and asked their concierge questions, they did not know their area. I always compare, they are not the BHH.
Few concerns. But I know that they go above and beyond from my room to numerous details that make my trip more relaxing. Regardless of how busy they are, they are always kind, and run to bring my car right away. Centrally located. Easy access to head out in any direction.
Very highly reommend.< /Review>

You can't beat this place for the money. Unlike any motel you'll see in LA. It screams Brasil !!! Wonderfully decorated & painted. Owner couple is typically super Brasilian nice. Their restaurant next door is awesome too. Each room has a little patio set outside where you can hang out sipping a drink. Although I've never been to Brasil, it felt like I was there.< /Text>

<text>Front desk Staff is EXTREMELY rude. I called one month in advance to book a garden room with a view for myself and my fiancée and they showed us to a basement room facing Sunset Blvd and simply said “that’s all we have tonight”. No apology was made for not honoring our booking. The room was over $1000/night and very load AND dirty. We opened the mini-bar and a water bottle inside was open and half drunk! Disgusting. I called the fro t desk and the concierge laughed and said he would send someone up to change the bottle but nobody ever came. Dinner was expensive and disappointing. The soup was stone cold when it arrived. Do not stay in this hotel for a special occasion. There are so many other choices and you can do so much better than the horrible Beverly Hills Hotel.< /text><user_id>110505313540586453271</user_id><time>1568684592910</time><rate>1</rate>< gmap_id>

We went for a swim during the evening as well and enjoyed the under water music whole floating in the pool looking into the starts and palm trees. Unforgettable moment.

< Review>
The Beverly Hills Hotel is Iconic, you have to go and have a drink in the Polo Lounge or the other club upstairs which I prefer. If you Valet Park and get a drink valet parking is taken care of. There's just something about this place that's pretty great to go and have a drink, even dinner.</Review>

<Text>The café is substantially smaller than I expected for a major hotel, although there's a wee patio area outside that, like the inside, has television screens - something people can no longer do without, apparently. Nobody is able to just sit and drink tea and be contented any more. Distraction is everything.< /Text><userid>111875733227609886040< /userid></record>

Beautiful, exquisite, and a great location. easy to get in and out of. I can't help but to think of the fact that the famous singer Whitney Houston( passed on) at this location. But apart from that it's very nice, inside and out.</Review>

<Text>I love Hotel Bel-Air
I stayed here this past weekend and I really did feel like I was in Brazil!
The decor of the motel both the inside and out is beautiful.
I felt like I was staying at a Brazilians house, eating brazilian food, listening to brazilian music, while I talked to some brazilians I met on my stay. Sounds like I pretty much went to Brazil right!

The owners are extremly nice and welcoming.
There is also a Brazilian restaruant right next door.
You can call in and get your food delivered to your room!
And to top everything off staying at Villa Brasil is very affordable!
I love this place.
I highly recomend staying here, you're seriously in for an adventure!< /Text>< pics>

<review>The best hotel in the world.
Simply gorgeous and breathtaking.
The finest of everything.
No wonder why this is the hotel of choice for celebrities, royalty and you and me.
Swim in the same pool as Oscar winners and dine to no end.
This is the ultimate experience that will create memories to last.

<Text>Once and a lifetime experience. We stayed here on our trip to L.A. It was pretty amazing. Food is pricey but, that's expected here and seeing I paid a good amount of money for one night, I just sat back and took it all in. Sat in the lobby people watching and it was a pretty cool to imagine all the people who have graced the hallways past and present. Never thought we'd be here. It was a great experience and if its in your budget, definitely worth a stay. People were fantastic, reception at the front desk was top notch. Aside from expensive food, this place was one of the best places I have ever stayed at!  9.5!!</Text>< UserId.>

<Text>This hotel is iconic, so it's already got that going for it. Really nice hotel; I used to make delieries here, but never stayed. The location is very easy to get to as it located smack dab in the middle of some major Beverly Hills cross-streets. This hotel is not going to come cheap, but it's nice, so if price isn't important to you, then you should definitely check it out.</Text>< time>

<text>Stayed here at the beginning of July for 2 nights, and not impressed. Hotel has no ambience, it is like a ghost town. Staff was friendly but upon arrival I was in shock that such a well known establishment has no music or any type of character. Yes, it is a famous hotel and that is the only thing they can milk out of it. The lobby smells like a funeral home and has no wow factor for the price. It really smells like an old grandmas house. With what they charge they can afford a nice sound system with great aromatherapy. The only thing I actually liked was the Fountain Cafe. Best tuna melt!< /text>< Pics>

Great Hotel but 700$ for one night?! This is sooooooo expensive and not worth it.
It is better to live in an apartment to see how life in la really is.< /Review>

The property is absolutely stunning, a secret and tranquil garden. The service is impeccable and they’ve thought of every detail. We always brings our dogs and they welcome them with open arms. Our dogs are our family so this means the world to us. In addition to our pups, every single detail is on point and every request is fulfilled.<//review><Rate>None< /Rate><date>1556323200000</date><username>Hotels.com reviewer</username></record></dataset><record>

What can you say about the pool? There is nothing more to say - it is an icon.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYUBwcxGEBvH3LZiM70h04v-OFXplYzeL8xAih=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

My favorite hotel and in my opinion, the finest hotel in the world.
Rich in history and it is often the choice of legends who sometimes even call this, The Pink Palace, their home.

Love the mystik and history of this place and they let us park our motorcycles in the garage right next to a lot of very famous peoples vehicles.  That was cool!  The food and staff were really cordial and amazing.  An unforgettable experience for brunch!</Text>

I had 6 big bags with me at check in. The hotel stuff saw the struggle, did not offer any sort of help. For a 5 star hotel This is not acceptable. Room was smelling funny, worn out blankets.very little amenities. Dirty coffee table. Beds were comfy. But everything else was a terrible mess. I had a lot of expectation and to make things worse after I had my buffet breakfast which comprised of 7 items in total. The waitress came in with a bill to my surprise.  18 dollar for morning breakfast. Never doing this again! Horrible experience<//Review>

Really, should i even do this review... It's the four seasons! I'm gonna say, very consistent with what I expected. From ordering a microwave for my room too lounging in my big plushy robe, it was all i expected it to be.

Definitely on the list for the come back tour :-)<//Text>

Yes, you really can drop by for a cup of coffee, just hop into a cab and go there. Truly amazing atmosphere, photos of film stars all over the place - you might even get to see a real one - a piece of living history!< /Text>

<Review>The bar at the Bel-Air Hotel used to have that same dated air. Later, someone came along and ripped it out during a renovation, replacing the classic Hollywood charm with something gray and soulless, presumably to appeal to the kind of trust-fund kids who have money to burn but no taste. I've never been back since.</Review>< pictures>

One of my favourite places in LA - all year long. It's a World class hotel, always a great place to stay or visit! It's charming, iconic, timeless and elegant. Elite crowd. The staff is always professional, detail oriented and kind, service is great. Location is good, beautiful areas, gardens, pool and nice restaurants.<//Review>

The Hotel Bel-Air is an incredibly luxurious and wonderful Resort. The grounds and environment are Immaculate, with beautiful plants, flowers, and Lawn areas. There is a natural Creek, with trickling water, swans, and ducks. All these lend to a tranquil and beautiful atmosphere. My room was wonderful, luxurious, and very comfortable. The staff are attentive and very friendly, and  they treat everyone like royalty. A stay at the hotel Bel-Air is an experience not to be missed.</Text>

The best hotel to stay in Los Angeles.  We love the staff and they are always very friendly and helpful.
The rooms are beautiful and the grounds are unbelievably wonderful. Just like a big garden. The Hotel Bel-Air is a private retreat away from the noise of Los Angeles, but close to the shops and restaurants of Beverly Hills.  I️t is an excellent hotel.<//text>

<review>Staff is very friendly and the rooms are nice. I went to the coffee shop for a quick pick me up and got a single shot of espresso. It was 10 dollars for the single shot of espresso. I get it, they gotta make money. But when I pay so much for a stay making every amenity that expensive is ridiculous. Have some complementary coffee or something 10 dollars for a single espresso is absolute lunacy.< /review>< Pics>

Gorgeous old Hollywood romance with beauty and style. Swans in the water. Marylin Munroe's swimming pool (now sadly missing it diving board. Lots of attentive staff there when you want/need them invisible when not you don't. Food is elegant and light (best by the pool). Expensive as hell of course!<//text>

The Hotel was very nice, well appointed, newly rennovated/new, and I enjoyed staying there. The staff was good, breakfast each day was good (hot and inc. in price of room) and my room was large with a new flat screen TV. The colors and decor throughout the hotel was really pleasant, bright/nice colors and contemporary style.< /Review>

The cafe is a fun and yummy local spot with a cool dinner vibe. A latte is $11, a 2 item omelette is approximately $28, validated valet $10...costly but good!< /Review>

Nothing short of excellent.  The view from my balcony room on my most recent stay was absolutely breathtaking, as are the beautiful gardens throughout the property.  Swim in the pool, it’s heated and there is music that plays UNDER THE WATER!!!!  (I know, right?!?!?!?!) ….but best of all, the staff is so very attentive, it’s truly remarkable.  Trust me, you won’t be disappointed.<//Text>

<userid>105106526175686341179< /userid><Text>I am not sure if it is just because you expect the Hotel Bel-Air to be amazing and so it is, but, this was an amazing place to visit. It was a very cold night and the staff apologized and insisted I come back when it is warmer. The cold did not get in the way of the experience. As you enter and then cross the bridge it feels a little "Secret Garden" like. If I had a home in that canyon I would want it surrounded with the same beautiful foliage they have worked into the property. The staff is very professional and quick to help with anything I needed for the night. We hosted a group for a cocktail event and their food, wine and environment was perfect for mixing and mingling. It was cold outside where the couches were and though they had heat lamps it would have been good to have an indoor sitting option.
The renovated rooms are fabulous. High ceilings, beautiful furniture, good layout.
Our after hours were spent in the bar enjoying a subtle piano player and fireplace. It feels like a classic part of LA history.</Text>< date>

<review>Food is good, but not the best I have had.  Still, you are paying for the ambience and the service, and both are pretty unbeatable.

A fantastic special occasion place.  Sit outdoors if you can as the weather here is usually amazing all year round.  It is amazing for brunch and for dinner.

Inside tip:  Their fried chicken is served only Sunday nights, and it is amazing.<//review><Rating>4< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Really cool mod vibed hotel. The room I stayed in was so cool and throwback to the 60s, I didn't know what to do! Also the staff is really nice, everyone I encountered, from the restaurant staff to the front desk.</Review>

< Review>
We have been staying at Four season and came for breakfast to check Beverly Hills Hotel out and maybe spend couple of days there. Staff is extremely rude!! Like wow! The security was so aggressive and rude when I tried to snap a pick OUTSIDE of the hotel the sign “ the Beverly hills” after we just spend $300 dollars on breakfast and was actually thinking to hangout there for couple of days.  Shame oh you Beverly hills hotel!!!< /Review>

This pink palace, otherwise known as The Beverly Hills Hotel, has long been a favorite among Hollywood stars both old and new. In 1956, Gregory Peck and Lauren Bacall filmed Designing Woman by its pool. The Polo Lounge was a favorite drinking haunt for Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and the rest of their Rat Pack. Today, it remains one of the top places in town to see and be seen.

Insider Tip: Don’t miss the hotel’s Fountain Coffee Room, which has a curved soda fountain counter and iconic banana leaf wallpaper< /text>

My name is George Anton. Hollywood film director. I love it here. The Beverly Hills Hotel. For over a century, The Beverly Hills Hotel has been the spot for Hollywood's brightest lights, the ultimate beacon of glamour. She greets you like a movie star from the moment you pass the iconic signage, step onto the signature red carpet and enter the grand lobby. Welcome to the legacy. The Beverly Hills Hotel</text>

Historic hotel, newly renovated and nestled in a canyon residential area of Beverly Hills.  Great staff who makes you feel welcome, on site gym and pool, beautiful spa, and the rooms come with the latest technology and beautiful decor.  Family and pet friendly, plus the food of Wolfgang Puck.  The lounge has a cool celebrity vibe.  Don't miss the Tina Turner wall or the swans in the "lake".</Review><Time>1509584227703<//Time><rating>5</rating>< Pictures>

It's a few miles from the Venice Boardwalk and i wish i had my bike because there are so many places to see there and so many things to do at Venice Beach.<//review>

<text>Loved their spa. It's very private and relaxing, and feels luxurious. The massage was very good. The whole setting there feels like you are somewhere far away from the bustle of Los Angeles. I parked at the property with valet (cost around $10-$12) but I believe there is street parking before you hit the hotel if you don't want to pay. I would go back in a heartbeat.</text>< resp>

We stayed at the Bel Air Hotel last June during our holidays in California and although it was booking at the last minute, we managed to get a fantastic price for the room. Firstly, the location is just perfect, hidden in the Bel Air area, it's really a cozy oasis in the bustling La, the neighborhood makes it even quieter, with all the green and palm trees. Attention to detail is simple everywhere. Very friendly and helpful staff, always ready to help you in any way possible, they can.< /review>

The great iconic hotel. So sad that it is owned by an evil tyrant who promotes KILLING gay and lesbian people by stoning them to death in his own country. Boycott this place until it has a new owner.</review>

One of my favorite neighborhood spots in LA.  I am NEVER not in the mood for Hotel Bel-Air.  It's almost absurdly pleasant.  Lunch, dinner, afternoon or evening cocktails, whatever.  It's tranquil but always fun. Food and drinks are wonderful, and every member of the staff is courteous and thoughtful.  Beautiful indoor and outdoor seating, the grounds are lovely.  It's a perfect place to go for a little respite from the bustle of the city.<//review>

<text>The location of the hotel is great because it's so accessible while being completely private. You'd never know just how spread out it is from looking at it. The rooms are amazing. Presidential Bungalow is worth every penny. Service is second to none. Special accommodations are their specialty. They add personal touches for every guest.<//text>< pictures>

For the most part this Hotel is great. Sometimes very noisy when crowded with kids banging doors closed. Parking lot can get tight. Very good location and clean. The staff is very friendly and the free breakfast is decent and filling. Very easy access to highways, restaurants and shopping.< /Text>

I would recommend this place to anyone who likes luxury travel, or is looking to splurge on a ro***tic getaway. The amenities in the room are pretty standard. The service is excellent. We always had transport willingly available to us from the resort. Offer nice price packages over weekends some times.< /text>

I picked up some folks going to airport. Very nice establishment. The only thing that pops into my head is, why can't I live like this? Why do (I) have to live in my car in a warehouse parking lot like an animal? This is the lifestyle I am meant to live. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong! 😉< /Review>

A very relaxing and elegant hotel to stay. The service at the Polo Lounge is professional and attentive, the lobby is spacious and comforting, and you will definitely feel the elegance of Beverly Hills in almost every detail of the hotel. The only comment I have to say is that for our extensive stay, we would've loved if the hotel had done some extra  five star touches to make the stay even more memorable. That would even make us come back sooner; overall, though, the hotel is amazing!<//Review>

The servers in the restaurant are always kind and courteous and very knowledgeable about both the food and the wines.
The rooms however crack me up sometimes I can't figure out if they ever left their grandmothers house and just bought nice things to go in it.
The suites are very spacious with all the amenities and has a very homey touch to it.
And the beds are so comfortable the pillows are comfortable and they have a big comfortable comforter. I could sleep for days and days in that bed</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Went for a drink at the pool bar, other than checking this off of places to see/things to do in LA, there's not a whole here. What you would expect from a famous Beverly Hills landmark. Service was good at the pool bar, food was alright. If you're there at the right time, you'll see some people you see on TV.</Review>

This is our go-to for very special occasions!  Request an "alcove table" (seating for 2-6) for more privacy and a terrific view of the patio. The service is top notch, the food & drink are the best (for birthdays/anniversaries, order a gorgeous handmade cake ahead of time) and if you see celebrities, just let them be. But if you see Wolfgang, be sure to talk to him!< /review>

<username>Terry Yarbrough</username><Review>Oh my god I've attended the event there The Pink Pump Affair. This hotel is so beautiful and totally over-the-top. The event I attended there was beyond anything that I could say. The food service that they gave during the event was a phenomenal. I made a donation to the fundraiser and I won a gifts. Who don't live gifts and surprises. I had to take pictures of the bathrooms because they were so organized they were so beautiful so outstanding late out walking through the lobby I was overwhelmed and and I felt like I was a star in the thirties the forties the 50s to 60s to 70s. Just can say I love this pink Hotel</Review>< user>

<review>First off, you can't beat the classic nature of the Beverly Hills Hotel. From the plan tree wallpaper to the photos on the wall of the Polo Lounge - where I just happened to brunch right after I proposed to my wife. Visit, spend the night, but whatever you do, get a chocolate malt in the coffee shop downstairs. It's pricey but 200000% worth it. One of my most favorite hotels in the whole world.<//review>< Pics>

If you don't look like youre supposed to be here don't expect to be treated fairly. My friend and I pulled up in his car to meet a friend and were treated like paupers by the valet. That's what common folk get at the hotel Bel-Air<//Text>

<Text>I stayed here with my two dogs and anybody that travels with dogs knows how important it is that their dogs (or dog) are accommodated for and absolutely appreciate it when they are treated with respect as if they were people. Hotel Bel Air made every effort to make me feel comfortable and my dogs feel comfortable with very plush dog beds and individual dog bowls and water bowls and freshly packaged dog biscuits already in the room before we got there. The hotel however does not offer a specific dog food menu but will literally make exactly what you want and how you want it when ordering room service. The grounds of the hotel are absolutely gorgeous and have plenty of pathways and grass areas which is also a major plus for walking the pups.<//Text>< GmapID>

Always love staying here. The service is always above and beyond my expectations. The rooms are recently renovated, so although the hotel is old and historic, it feels brand new! Location is the best for Beverly hills as it is more private and serene, nestled in the middle of a residential area. Can't say enough good things about this place!</text>

It's ok to be courteous to a ride-share driver,even if you're not making tips off of them .
Just because you're in a "special"mood doesn't give you the right to be condescending,disrespectful and prejudice.
On a lighter note, if your employer is a muslim,I think you've lost the "right" to act/be a racist bigot.

I wish HR is more selective hiring the first faces customers see when they first get to the establishment.<//Text>< Rating>

Drinks in the bar at 7pm which was so dark and underwhelming, I couldn't read the menu. Service adequate but not good, no water  was offered. TV was on at the bar which is crass.  Paid my bill with cash and whilst waiting for valet parking ($12 a complete rip off) bar man came charging up saying we hadnt left enough money. I tersely told him I'd left $40 dollars in cash which the female bar woman had taken. The dollars left with the bill were the tip. We were furious, he was apologetic which was too late, he should have checked before making an accusation. Worst experience ever in 5 star hotel. Over rated, appalling service don't waste time or money visiting.< /Text>

The inside was luxurious. But the pool was surprisingly not as glamorous or large as I expected. And there were many kids t splashing water here and there. I went on a Friday. Maybe a Monday or Tues would be more serene< /Text>

<time>1456444800000<//time><Rating>None</Rating><text>Overall, I loved this hotel--sparkling accommodations, lush gardens, lovely pool.  Staff courteous and helpful.  It is out-of-the-way, in a private, intimate setting.  Which is great, except that you are dependent on the hotel for meals, coffee, snacks, in short--everything--because it is located in a residential area that is miles from the city.  The cost of these extras exceeded the cost of the room (there is a daily charge for wifi--who charges for that anymore?).  Restaurant prices are exorbitant--which I wouldnt have minded if the food were good, but it was MEDIOCRE at best…and you cannot walk down the street to other restaurants.  No coffee-maker in the room (you have to buy theirs); no iron in the room (you have to pay for pressing); you get the idea.  Bring lots of cash, because everyone has their hand out.  My husband characterized it as the greediest hotel hes ever encountered.  That said, I still enjoyed it!  Next time, Id probably have food delivered.< /text>< Pictures>

Loved this place! Would've sat outside if temperature was about 10 degrees warmer. Brunch was delicious! I rated food 4 starts because my friend ordered yogurt and it came in a very small stemless martini glass, and honestly, Paying what we did for it I feel like you should've received more. One more thing, mimosas were $12. I don't mind paying for nice things but $12? Overall, I recommend this place and would definitely come back and tell my friends!< /text>

We had brunch at the poolside cafe. Great ambiance, friendly staff. Food was decent and didn't really stand out or satisfy, especially at the prices, but you're paying for the atmosphere and the experience. Not sure I would go back for a meal on a random day, but on the short list of places to go for occasions or if we have guests from out of town.</Text>

We can only echo previous reviews in that the gardens make this such a lovely place to stay. The surprising part was how conveniently located it is to everything. The rooms are nicely sized. The grounds are timeless very peaceful take a book and just relax and enjoy the surroundings.</Review>

We stayed here over six months ago but we keep reminiscing about the incredible service we received there so I decided I should finally write a review. The grounds are gorgeous, the room was a touch on the small side, but super well equipped. The bathroom was fantastic - an oasis.</Review>

They destroyed this once elegant and beautiful establishment.  I patronized the dining room on many occasions and, in fact, was there to partake of the last meal before they closed for a protracted renovation.  A few weeks after reopening, I went to see what was done.  I recognized almost nothing.  It's a disaster.  Having lunch, I realized I was being subjected to Queen's Freddie Mercury singing "Everyone Bites the Dust."  I love the song and Queen but during lunch at the Bel-Air?  I think not.  I have not returned and many others have done the same.  What a tragedy !<//text>

The difference is really in the bathroom, which is a highlight in the Loft Room or the balcony/Jacuzzi which is the best feature to the Canyon Suite. The hotel is nestled in the beautiful Bel Air neighborhood and you will thoroughly enjoy a daily walk in this peaceful enclave. The overall atmosphere is classy and comfortable as a getaway.<//Text>

It's like staying at The Beverly Hills Hotel! Because it is The Beverly Hills Hotel! Nothing Is Better! Eat at The Polo Lounge!</review>

I love this place!  When we checked they upgraded us for free to a mini suite which is a corner room!  The view is spectacular!  We have stayed here before and love it every time.  The staff is very attentive and happy.  The rooms at spacious.  It is close to ATT park so if going to the game or an event  you can walk from the hotel!  You won't be disappointed if you stay here.<//Review>

<text>Awesome location near all the tourist Hotspots, room was super clean and looked like deluxe probably looks in heaven and the service was 5 star... Everyone from vallet to front desk was proactive in assisting and seemed to know what we needed even before we requested it. Keep up the good work.< /text>< pics>

second stay at this gorgeous resort, everything seems to be perfect except this is second time in a row that room was not ready for check in when we arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm, otherwise entire stay was perfect. The manager did comp drinks and appetizer at the bar for the delay.</Review>

Everyone had thoughtful suggestions for things to do during our stay in LA, and were prompt in attending to our needs. The setting of the hotel is so refreshing after a long day of shopping or simply fighting the LA traffic. It's the old lack of training and visible ***agement.<//Review>

I recently stayed three nights and my experience was simply incredible!  I didn't want to leave and I can't wait to stay there again.  The staff is so professional, friendly, courteous, and really make you feel welcome and right at home.  Also, the service and food at all of the on-site dining/drinking options (Polo Lounge, Fountain Coffee Room, Cabana Cafe, and Bar Nineteen12) is second to none.  Stay here, you will not be disappointed. I don't generally write reviews but felt compelled to do so because my experience was just so remarkably good.  Thanks B.H.H.!!! I'LL BE BACK SOON!<//Review>

<Review>We really enjoyed our dinner here when we stayed at the Hotel Bel-Air.  I had the fish and chips and it was delicious.  The fish was excellent and the chips were nice and thick.  My boyfriend had a steak that was also very good.  The outside dining was beautiful on a summers night.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2bcf12bd777e1:0x8f0e72ca4c31466d<//gmapID></record>

Unfortunately this gorgeous Mecca is owned by an a****** bigot. Not to be overlooked, but the staff and their tips should not suffer because of this fact which the wonderful staff has no control over...... so I enjoy but I still say the owner is an a****** bigot every chance I get.

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Due to the unprofessional room reservation system, as I experienced on 3/6; I had my room revservation confirmation# already but once I brought all my luddages to the lobby. One guy incharged in "Directior of assisstant room service position" appearedat the lobby, show me a picece of paper  and have me sign up  in order to reject my reservation.
"WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION IN ADVANCE before the customer arrive; for this reason Hotel Bel-Air SHOULD NOT reach any 5-star WORLDWIDE standard at all. I even don't want to give them any star. This is such kind of trash made whole Bel Air area become like LAUSY community. This hotel did not fit with  Bel Air community expectation at all.

Never been to the Beverly Hills Hotel, it looks really beautiful but I have a few questions.
Do any of the rooms have mirrors on the ceiling? Can you get pink champagne on ice there? And although you can check out anytime you like, can you ever leave?< /Text>

Disappointed for the first time, the carpets were stained badly, couple pieces of trash in parking lot, had to ask for water 3 times, felt like I was a bother, just wasn't anything like what I have experienced in the past. The attention to detail seemed to be declining..< /Review>

We usually go to the Peninsula Beverly Hills for tea, but we decided to try something new, and I like the ambiance, food and service here a bit more. However, the tea selection at Pen seems a bit better.</Review>

For a restaurant that charges a high premium you should expect the same attention to service. We ordered 4 dishes , 2 of which were French toast that came out COLD. They took ours away while our friends then had to eat their meals. It just wasnt a great experience especially for someone's birthday. After all that it took a while to get 2 new French toasts (our friends had basically finished eating). The service this time was slow and poor enough for all of us to not return in the future.</Review><username>Lewis Egley< /username>< user>

As good as it gets. So many great places to eat on the 11 acre spread in the heart of Beverly Hills. The staff and service are an example to all, from the valets to the front of house to the service staff at the restaurants. If money is no object, but your standards are best-in-class, then count on this place.<//review>

Atmosphere: not quite as elegant as the old restaurant but still beautiful and, for the most part, quiet enough to have a conversation (a rarity in L.A. these days), but the noise increased (though not too intrusive) when they piped in (bizarrely) some country music, and it was about to get much noisier at the time we were about to leave, there being a large wedding taking place seemingly throughout the hotel, with multiple music venues.  Something worth checking out when you make a reservation.  As to all the reviewers who complained about “exorbitant” prices: give me a break!  Wolfgang Puck plus Hotel Bel-Air does not equal MacDonald’s prices.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>We went to go have lunch at the Polo Lounge and the service was amazing and on point and the drinks were really good. The food was meh, we ordered mains and an appetizer and the meat tasted very charbroiled, a little bit of a flavoring is good, but it was an overpowering. Overall the food the drinks and service and ambiance were all wonderful but the food was not worth the price.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bcf12bd777e1:0x8f0e72ca4c31466d< /Gmap_id>< rating>

<Review>The service is amazing at the Polo Lounge, and the patio is wonderful. The food was very good, but I will say that it felt a little overpriced, but I suppose that's ok given it's really cool history. The Fountain room in the basement is my favorite, it's a mandatory stop for me every time I'm in town, and you have to try the apple pie!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>We held a birthday brunch for 10 people here on Sunday, granted it was a perfect LA day which added to the atmosphere, but it was just a very special place, with excellent food, great service, and terrific ambience. We were there for 3 hours! no body wanted to leave, I suppose the flowing champagne helped ! great exeperience and not as expensive as you would think.<//Text><userid>103324377757773711599</userid>< resp>

I parked on the street to avoid valet fees.
Inside doesn't seem as fancy as I expected.
I possibly would add an extra star if I stayed in one of the rooms for the night and rated it, but hey maybe another time.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

After learning my brother was in a serious car accident in Saint Louis Obispo my wife and I decided to drive down to LA and check us into the Beverly Hills hotel. We wanted to take my mother's mind off my brothers accident. Explaining the story to the Hotel staff they checked us into one of the bungalows. Keep in mind I did not find the price for a room any higher then a quality hotel room. I work for hotels and this hotel had to top any hotel I've ever stayed at. The staff, the service, the decor. Everything about this property: is 5 stars. One example the hotel staff did for us was one night we were going out for dinner, the concierge provided a limousine free of charge. Another experience was in the Polo Lounge. One of the patrons claiming to be a producer was annoying by trying to cast my wife in a film. The manager of the Polo Lounge would not let us pay for any of our cocktails. Working for the hotel industry for over 20 years this is unheard of. I would like to thank the staff for five star hospitality.<//Text>

<Text>I stayed at the Hotel Bel-Air while visiting LA with my boyfriend who was traveling for business. The Hotel Bel-Air was a true dream. Upon walking into the beautiful entry way, I saw the beautiful swans swimming in the small river passing under the bridge taking you to a walkway which leads to the lobby.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><time>1486796882508<//time></record></dataset><record>

< review>
We stayed at the Hotel Bel-Air for several days during New Year's and did not have one complaint! The hotel is in an excellent location. They offer free wi-fi and a free wine hour from 5-6 pm and the staff is excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. We will definitely be staying here on our next visit to CA .<//review>

<Text>This place isn't any great place.

Hubby and and I came on a Friday night for DineLa. We were early and seated very quickly. There are booths and in the center are tables. Ambience is romantic with dim lights. It could get cold since seating is sort of an outdoor area patio but it's kind of covered with heat lamps. Hubby had to grab a coat.

Food was good but not great. Maybe it was the set menu for DineLa so I'll have to come back to try the other regular dishes.

Parking isn't great. There's street parking across the street if you come early enough but other wise there's valet with the hotel.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I was picking up someone at hotel. The valet wanted me to go to a middle lane. My guests were in front by the first lane pulling up to the hotel. He dashed to my side of the car started pounding his hand repeatedly on my car like a crazy person. Screaming at me and continued to pound on my car. I was startled taken aback and could not believe any 1 star hotel let alone a so called 5 star hotel would allow a valet to behave like this. I was scared and shaken and basically assaulted by a valet. I called the hotel to review the tape. The manager called me back and tried to defend his behavior as a tap. I drive a Mercedes and this was not a tap. I was disgusted by her defending him. I would never stay at this hotel. It is disgusting and a disgrace to Beverly Hills.

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>Came here over the weekend to catch the NBA finals. Had a few drinks and appetizers at their bar. Food and drinks were delicious! Staff and bartenders here were very friendly, however there was a waitress who kept on conversating with a fellow colleague. The room was quiet enough and all you heard was her conversation about Coachella and whatnot. Somewhat unprofessional at such a high-end establishment. Remember to see the seans before you leave!<//Review>< Pictures>

The staff is fantastic! Not in a disingenuous (stuffy) way. Maybe the last place you'd expect that to be the case, but even with being taken aback at how immaculate location is, the "realness" of the staff completely outshined. Six out of five!</review>

If you want just water they will give you VOSS water, and they will always bring out a small appetizer that changes from day to day, a chief special if you will. It is also one of the most expensive restaurants in LA, but if you have the money then I would definitely recommend going.</Review>< user_name>

I was going to be married there, in June 2010, but due to an unexpected (ahem) pregnancy, we were unable to. We called to cancel 9 months in advance, giving them ample time to update their timetable.

The hotel decided they ought to keep hold of our $1500 deposit, and didn't offer to exchange it for a short stay there or anything.

You owe us, Hotel Bel-Air.</Text>

Unique hotel and dining location tucked away in the hills of Bel-Air. Finest, superbly prepared cuisine, operated by Wolfgang Puck for Dorchester properties. Great table service. Could be a good spot for star gazing, as the secluded location and very pricey menus attract members of the "hoity-toity". Bring lots of cash.<//review>

You should be ashamed. Svend Petersen worked for you for over 40 years and you can't even help the guy. He's 86 years old & had to sleep under a bridge.

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>My wife and I stayed four nights at the hotel couple weeks ago. We were celebrating her birthday and our anniversary. Prior to our arrival we were very excited for staying at the BHH- iconic, legendary etc. Upon arrival we requested if possible to have a room with a nice view. The front desk person assure us in a very condescending voice, the room we will be staying in is very nice and with a view, an upgrade from what our reservation was for. To our surprise, it was everything but! The room not only was very small, noisy being on the second floor, the worst was the tiny balcony with view of the wall and the dumpster. What a disaster! I did go back to the front desk, and a different person took care of the issues. Unfortunately it's a little too late, the excitement was gone. We stay at luxury hotels, for the experience, the nice accommodations, bathrooms and toiletries (which the BHH has the most generic products), the attention to details. Alas, BHH is more about being stuffy, outdated, confused staff and more like a three stars hotel than a luxury five stars one. The good news is, we have a lot better options for our future visits to Beverly Hills and the surroundings.</text>< Pictures>

I only stayed here one night. It was paradise. Of course, I did not pay, my company did. They
ended up settling on a cheaper competitor for as regular BH hotel.<//review>

Years ago, the food at the Polo Lounge was amazing, but from 2012-2016, I have found the taste, presentation & overall quality of the food & the beverages very subpar, and mainly seems the consistency is completely lacking. Not worth the $1500 bill at the end of the Father's Day meal my family had.</text>

For business or pleasure they do it just right we told them it was our honeymoon they put pink rose peddals on our bed by turndown service in the shape of a heart! everybody knows you by name even the cleaning crew! And the thing i was most impressed with was that all the staff step to the side when your coming down the path! They dont miss a beat from the decor to the spa! Bottom line if your looking for SERVICE this is the place!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>We stayed in a bungalow. Unfortunately when we got to the room the bathtub wasn't really clean. Plus the room really needs to be redecorated. It was dark and the walls were dark and had a single window which was obscured by bushes outside. It was small and very pricey. Not what I expected from a hotel of this class.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<username>Travelocity reviewer<//username><review>Hotel is perfect for a romantic getaway.Decoration is amazing, location is exclusive and staff make an excellent job.Unfortunately, you will find out unexpected extra charges for parking (per night), Wi-Fi, even extra charge for room service, how bad is that?Additionally I couldn’t enjoy the Jacuzzi of my room because someone will be turn it off every day while I was out, and after a long day I will arrive and found it cold, it takes forever to heat and when it finally gets ready I was to sleepy to use it.I probably would stay in hotel again, maybe in a room without Jacuzzi.<//review>< response>

This review is strictly for the Polo Club restaurant. We finally went here from brunch yesterday after my girlfriend had been pleading for us to try it for months.

Needless to say, after going here once, we won't be back. Don't get me wrong, the grounds were lovely and the service was fine. It's just that the food quality was literally that of a Howard Johnson complimentary continental at a price point befitting its Beverly Hills address.

I got a chorizo omlette with hash browns. It honestly looked and tasted like it came out of a frozen package from Trader Joes. It was caloric sustenance, no more and no less. My gf got the french toast, which was slightly better, but again, a rather large letdown. For $24 a plate and $7 coffee (not to mention $9 valet service), we expected a great breakfast. Instead, we left feeling taken advantage of.

Go elsewhere. Almost anywhere is a better value.<//Text>

The best hotel in Los Angeles, probably North America, and quite possibly the entire world. A marvel to any luxury traveler with an eye for detail. They didn't miss anything. Sometimes when I'm here, I play a little game with myself where I try to find fault with some aspect of the the hotel and I can't do it. It's on the pricey side (but no more than any other luxury brand) and it's totally worth every penny. If you're looking for tranquility in the big city, world class service in the most luxurious and peaceful setting imaginable, then you've come to the right place.

I'd recommend this place as the perfect venue for an incredible date, to pop the question, to have the wedding at, or to go on your honeymoon at. I think you get my drift- it's one of the most elegant and romantic spots in the world. Everything here is world class.

The food is incredible. Honestly, they do room service so well here, that I often prefer to dine in than go out to some of my favorite restaurant in LA. It's kind of a funny thing, but the Hotel Bel Air may be home to the best Huevos Rancheros in the world (honorable mention for the steak frittes.) They also have an amazing bar area with one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had.

The rooms are really the masterpieces of the structural part of the hotel though. From almost any point in the room you can control the temperature, the lights (there are such convenient settings for them too,) or order any of the services the hotel has to offer. The miss no details, right down to the heated bathroom floors in winter. I'd invite anyone who's reconsidering a remodel of their home to come stay here for a couple of nights to take notes on features you might not have thought of, but will instantly recognize as perfection.

And the real masterpiece is the service. My only warning is that once you've been treated this well, you may not feel like anywhere else really lives up. For an incredibly busy person, this is the place for you. I have them unpack and pack my bags upon arrival and departure (they do about ten times a better job than I could and in a fraction of the time.) The concierge desk here rivals that of any in the world. Just tell them what you're interested in, and they'll supply you with an insiders itinerary for whatever it is you fancy. I saw them handling the medical needs of a guest so well yesterday that I secretly wished that they working in my doctors office when I got back home. They got me into an impossible restaurant within an hour of my asking and I can tell you from experience that doing these kinds of things is the norm out here.

Lastly, I know there's some controversy with the owner of this hotel, but after I thought about boycotting this place it occurred to me that I would most definitely not be doing any real damage to this man on the other side of the world who's worth 20 billion dollars. Instead, I would be hurting the people I've come to value most in this city. I'd imagine the people who are really suffering are the employees of this hotel, who are probably losing their jobs wholesale from this boycott thing. They're genuinely some of the most intelligent, empathetic, knowledgeable, and caring people in this city. So I am still very happy to stay here, because I'm for supporting them. I can understand the other perspective, and it's certainly valid, this is just my two cents.< /text>

< Review>
My company had a conference in Los Angeles (we make fake vomit and dog poo). Normally the Fake Vomit And Dog Poo Conference, FVADPC for short, is held in Pittsburgh in February, but this year due to a mix up with the booking agent, we ended up in the Beverly Hills Hotel. Now most members of FVADPC are of a working class bent. We like beer, pizza, football and whistling at construction workers. We also are, as a group, a bunch of practical jokers as our choice of profession no doubt informs. This seemed to rub the other hotel guests the wrong way, though I could hardly blame them I guess. One morning they are enjoying their 3oz $50 freshly squeezed orange juice, the next they are seated next a large sweaty man in a tattered sports jacket and a shopping bag full of fake dog poo. The staff were not well pleased either. I mean the worst a maid has to deal with on a daily basis is some questionably stained sheets and copious amounts of left over cocaine. The last thing they want to see when they pull off the bedcloths is a vast swath of quivering fake puke. (We used the deluxe version for one maid, the one with the bits of carrot and corn) However, the place was fantastic! The pool had water in it and you would not believe the muffins! Gus from Wisconsin ate 28 organic bran muffins at the first breakfast. He never left his room after that. We enjoyed the conference and the guest speaker, A Leslie Nielson look-a-like. Also we got to tour the famous homes of Beverly Hills and we were allowed into 3 stores on Rodeo Drive. Next year we are back in the Sunnyside motel in downtown Pittsburgh. It won't be quite the same.<//Review>

Yes I miss the Golden Girls decor. The renovation is more Shahs of Sunset than Bel Air. The location is still magic and the food is much better. The Valley girls behind the bar a clueless and will bring you the wrong food order over and over and over again.< /Review>

The bar area has become way too noisy with the younger crowds.  The kitchen has lost its touch with creating anything spectacular.  Still a nice place to meet friends but out of the way for any business meetings.</Review>

<text>Well where do I start, one particular member of staff kept rolling her eyes at me while talking to me there was no eye contact and she would often go and assist others while dealing with my complaint, this was my third trip to this hotel and I can tell you it will be my last I sent an email and had no reply truly disgusted.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) One of my favorite hotels. Great service. Good with car service that drives and fetches you. The rooms are nice but can differ in size. We have lived in different rooms with and without a balcony. Breakfast by the pool is difficult. Nice to hang out by the pool, have lunch. Well worth going down to the garage if you are interested in cars, there are a number of classics parked.

(Original)
Ett av mina favorithotell. Fantastisk service. Bra med car service som kör och hämtar dig. Rummen är fina men kan skilja sig i storlek. Vi har bott i olika rum med och utan balkong. Frukost vid poolen är svårslaget. Trevligt att hänga vid poolen, äta lunch. Väl värt att åka ner i garaget om man är intresserad av bilar, det finns en rad klassiker parkerade.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The hotel from the outside is very nice, it seems tiny, although I don't know quiet because the roads there are super busy. They have about 4 or 5 valet parking at the door and the surrounding mansions are impressive.

(Original)
El hotel por fuera es muy bonito, parece chiquitito, aunque tranquilidad no se yo porque las carreteras que hay son super transitadas. En la puerta tienen como 4 o 5 aparcacoches y las mansiones que hay por los alrededores son impresionantes.</text>

<date>1535571955299</date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) During our stay in the United States we spent a few more days at this wonderful hotel, where everything is done to satisfy the guests. Maybe a little expensive, but the game is worth it because in this establishment we feel privileged. The bungalows where nothing is missing are upscale and very luxurious. In the restaurant the dishes are irreproachable and better every day, served by an experienced staff.

(Original)
Lors de notre séjour aux états unis nous avons passé à nouveau quelques jours dans cet hôtel merveilleux, où tout est fait pour satisfaire les clients. Peut-être un peu cher, mais le jeu en vaut la chandelle car dans cet établissement nous nous sentons privilégiés. Les bungalows où rien ne manque sont haut de gamme et très luxueux. Au restaurant les plats sont irréprochables et meilleurs chaque jour, servis par un personnel expérimenté.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZcFGXK9Q2FsTv4weX-pREcIVCTA-69iR9gUm_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT-bV-CmBu_8r5GbkutL3VupCVI_PRAkJHGYvJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUXuEjjqb7FwPXgPgd-Jbv7d6Ffk9R1rYGHTHD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIlexvuBkPEumtzuYBzLBqApmDgA9MvLZR6-4U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>(Translated by Google) It is an ancient and historic hotel, the destination of all Hollywood movie stars. Nice atmosphere, good service. I didn't sleep but had lunch, I must say well and with great service, at the pool restaurant. Well attended and pleasant, even if the structure, with its dated architecture, and the "moquettona" everywhere in my opinion needs a breath of renewal.

(Original)
È un albergo antico e storico, meta di tutte le Star del cinema di Hollywood. Bella atmosfera, buon servizio. Non ho dormito ma pranzato, devo dire bene e con un ottimo servizio, al ristorante della piscina. Ben frequentato e piacevole, anche se la struttura, con la sua architettura datata, e la "moquettona" dappertutto necessita a mio avviso di una ventata di rinnovamento.</Text></record>

De nouveau une expérience parfaite. Le service est de très haut niveau avec un personnel toujours très attentionné, très efficace et très réactif pour faire de votre séjour un moment unique. L’Hotel Bel-Air est idéalement situé au sein d’un grand espace paysagé avec différents lieux de résidences discrets qui communient avec la nature. Les Chambres et les Suites disposent de tout le confort et de l’équipement moderne d’un hôtel de ce rang. Ambiance magique !<//text>

(Translated by Google) A must-see for LA, a real journey back in time. Staff caring and smiling. The dishes lack a bit of originality for the restaurant by the pool.

(Translated by Google) A historic luxury hotel in Los Angeles .. some shops are also in the interior .. obviously not cheap prices for both the rooms and the shops. You can still visit the lobby, shops and cafe. For the pool instead you need to have a pass. The hotel is also famous for star photo shoots!

Un grand séjour avec salon doté d'une cheminée, un bureau, une Master Bedroom avec un espace coiffeuse, un dressing et une salle de bain superbe (+1 à l'entrée). La Suite s'ouvre sur un grand patio équipé en mobilier avec cheminée externe et un grand jacuzzi. Expérience extraordinaire à recommander et à vivre absolument.<//Text>< Resp>

<text>Das Hotel befindet sich in einer sehr ruhigen Gegend von Bel Air. Die Zimmer wurden alle vor ca. zwei Jahren renoviert oder komplett neu erstellt. Der Zustand ist hervorragend. Wir hatten eine Canyon Premier Suite, welche unsere Erwartungen übertroffen hat. Insgesamt ein Top Hotel in Los Angeles.</text>< username>

(Translated by Google) It's wonderful, I think that 5 stars are "nothing", this beautiful and very authentic Hotel deserves another 5 stars. We went with my wife to have lunch with my friends Zach and Kami, being pleasantly amazed by everything, it is worth visiting it, its gardens scented in Jasmine, the greenery, its pool, seeing is a whole. Thanks guys!

(Original)
Es maravilloso , creo que 5 estrellas son la "nada", este bello y muy auténtico Hotel se merece otras 5 estrellas más.  Fuimos junto a mi señora a almorzar junto a mis amigos Zach y Kami , quedando gratamente maravillados por todo, vale muchísimo visitarlo, sus jardines perfumados en Jazmines, el verdor, su piscina, la ver es un todo.

We used to stay at The Hotel Bel Air everytime we travel to Los Angeles and its always a great experience.Its one of the best locations in LA, very quiet and intimate.To be recommended if you expect high quality services and discretion.<//review>
