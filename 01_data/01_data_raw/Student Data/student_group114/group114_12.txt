These dudes take their time to explain and do the job right but doesn’t B S around and waste time. So much better than Firestone in Small Town Clovis. Polite, Professional, Quick. Not going anywhere else anymore.

2 days later:
Had an issue with my truck where someone tried to take my catalytic converter when I was parked at Woodward park. They showed me exactly what happened and referred me to their brother shop. SUPER HELPFUL, and still cool as ever. Professionalism.<//Review>

<Text>Business as usual and the business was good. Came in for an alignment. They noticed a questionable frame repair and instead of doing the alignment knowing it would be of dubious help, they informed me of this. And then refused to charge me. Integrity is something I always think of with these people.<//Text>< GmapID>

I'm writing to express my heartfelt gratitude to the employees of the midus store at 7340 blackstone ave in fresno. I cant thank the people there enough for what they did for me. They went so far above and beyond I cant even put into words how amazing they were. I needed to have my brakes fixed as another midus did not live up to the standards that have been set by the people at this store and I wanted new tires for my car. Which they were able to help me with. I had an appointment on the 7th of October at 9am, but the night of the 6th, my father went into the hospital and I was told I may only have a few hours left with him. I left the hospital at about 830 in the morning on the 7th so that other family could visit with him, and I could drop my car off. Hearing the situation, I was given a ride back to the hospital completely free of charge, and when my car was ready I was even given an uber back to the shop, where my car was ready and paperwork was ready to get me out of the store in less then 5 mins and to get me back to the hospital as fast as possible. My dad passed later on the night of the 7th.... while my heart is broken with loss, your team of employees, made it where I was able to hold my dads hand, and be there with him for every minute that he had left. I cant thank your team enough for what they did for me. While this has been one of the hardest points in my life, it has been the best from a service stand point. I just want to thank your entire team, I'm sorry I can't remember names right now, my mind is all over the place, it took a few days to even be able to form words, but I just want everyone to know how far the team went out of thier way for me and what they did for me. Also the work they did was great, the new tires and the brakes having them work again means a lot to my family as I am on the road a lot for work. I know I didnt say enough about your team as it is still hard to get my thoughts out lately, but I just wanted to say thank you, and I hope you are able to see how much it meant to me what they did. You have a customer for life, thank you so much.

Service was fast. Raymond was extremely helpful. He didn't try and sale me anything I didn't need. He was very polite and professional.   I was out of there in less than an hour and I got my oil changed, tires rotated, and a new air filter put in. Plus all the other services they do as a courtesy check and they were open on the holiday, which was really convenient. Overall an A+ rating from me.<//Text>

I had my vehicle towed in and Ray got me in right away. Angel gave me a call within the hour to inform me of my vehicle. They went through the courtesy check thoroughly with me & let me know my vehicle needed a starter. Vehicle is working great. Great service and great attitudes!  I would absolutely recommend River Park Midas for all your car repairs.</Review>

<text>I had been going to Midas for years up until last year when I had a horrible encounter with their manager Chris. I wrote a review after that experience as I was very upset with what had happened. When I had arrived I witnessed the then manager Chris verbally cursing at one of his employees and was hesitant to go inside. Once dealing with him he was very argumentative and rude with me and I had never experience anything like that before. I decided I would not ever go back. My uncle had service with them a few weeks ago and told me that the store was under new management and that the new guy gave him a great deal on his breaks so I decided to give them another try. I called first and spoke to the new manager Gregory. He was super nice and told me he could get me in right away. When I got there he greeted me with a smile and listed to what I had to say. I wasn't sure what was wrong with my vehicle I just new that it pulling to the right when I was driving. He told me that they would check it out and let me know what was going on within the hour. I went to lunch and came back and he explained exactly what the issue was so that I could understand and didn't make me feel like I was stupid. He gave me a fair price to fix the issue and even offered me a coupon to add an oil change. They fixed the problem and I am very happy with my service. I will definitely make Midas my go to shop again.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Nice and friendly workers and very fast service only problem is informational option and knowledge with what type of service is available for newer vehicles, never just put motor oil in a car that is not recommended by manufacturer. But Midas will indeed fix it and make the customer happy. Thanks<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Used to like going here because they provided good cost and service. However, the one time I had my wife take the car for an oil change, they stated the CV boot was broken and wanted to charge $800 to replace it. I looked at it myself and also had another car repair shop look at it for a second opinion. There was nothing wrong with it. It's sad that they would try to take advantage of my wife when she does not have much knowledge about cars.< /text>< Pics>

I don’t understand why I keep coming back to Midas. I have been going back and forth from the Clovis location to the Riverpark location for my service on my vehicle. Every so often I get good management and I am happy with my car. But I swear I keep getting followed by the manager from h3!!.. his name is Chris. He is now at this location and I am absolutely appalled that ownership has not gotten rid of him yet. He is nothing but rude to customer and even to his employees. I have had nothing but terrible experiences dealing with this guy. Even his employees have told me that they absolutely hate him. Obviously the owner doesn’t care about his staff or his customers based on the reviews for his stores. So I will no longer be going to any of their locations. You all should go to Les Schwabb. It’s a little pricier but at least no Chris and I am absolutely okay with that.<//text>

< Review>
I called around for a set of four tires for my Altima, and they were the best price in town and they offer free rotate/balance and flat repairs!  We I arrived they got me taken care of right away and were extremely friendly.  There ended up being a mistake in the tires I ordered but the fixed it and at no extra charge.  The manager there was super nice and one of the guys there kept answering ALL of my 3 yr old son’s questions.  HIGHLY Recommended!!<//Review>

My new brake rotors had a gash in them, they said it was okay and wouldnt affect my brake pads. Was thinking new metal should be smooth and no imperfections.<//Review>

<Review>This location put the wrong oil filter on our car causing the oil filter to fall off while driving and dump all our engine oil out. The manager Chris Perkins would not take responsibility and refund us our out of pocket cost to fix the issue with Midas installing the wrong part.

<review>Use to be the only place I trusted, after someone told me there experience I ignored them. Took car in because of hard starting, $485 later still hard starting and feel stupid I didn't trust other reviews. PS You don't get money back from parts installed and labor, even if it didn't need to be done. Tires and oil, but nothing else, but I won't even give them that!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<text>Not a great experience with this midas. Was going to use a groupon and I called ahead to make sure they would honor it and they told me not to buy the groupon they would just give me the price.  Went in for an oil change and they found $1900 worth of repairs that needed to be made on my car. I purchased the repairs. The next day I noticed that they put the wrong oil in my car and it was driving terribly. I called and asked if they could fix it and they tried to tell me it doesn't matter what kind of oil they use. I had them change it anyways. The car drove much better and they assured me I could have confidence in the rest of their work. A couple days later the grill from my car fell off while I was driving. Less than a month later my car started making a terrible clunking noise in the same area as some of the repairs. Since midas has a 90 national warranty I took it to a different midas, and sure enough the screws had come loose on the repairs done at this midas. I would go elsewhere.</text>< Pics>

They put the wrong part on my car! Could have ruined my engine! Chris Perkins refused to make it right, after I had to have it towed and their mistake made right by Ford. He also tried to convince me that I needed $1000 in new tires when I took it in the first time. I took it to West Coast tires and Ford to make sure. Both companies said I didn't need tires! Don't trust them.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. I took my car in for a $30 oil change and ended up spending $100 on service that "needed" to be done including "cleaning" the erosion on my battery and replacing the air filters. I asked to see my old filters and they were not in any condition to be replaced. After I checked under the hood the battery was still eroded. On top of it all the oil was leaking. Terrible service I would not suggest anyone going here. They would not refund either because they claimed they did it "right". If you did it "right" then why are you guys offering to fix it?</Text>< pics>

After alignment of drove my car home when I step on the break my powers steering is shaking. When I get home I left my car up and check. I see the tie rod end out is bad the boots already rip off, i can wiggle by used my hand and also the sway stabilize bar both boots also tearing and Midas technician still do the alignment. There is telling me that Midas technician not certified to be technician mechanic. If Midas technician certify and have experience they should call me and tell me that tie rod end and sway bar need to replace before do alignments. This is my first time with Midas and never ever go there again. For those who don't know about alignments, the tie rod end out is to adjust the alignment so if the tie rod is bad and Midas technician still do the alignment them that telling me the technician don't know what they doing.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Dreadful Customer Service

This place is not even worth a single star.  I supposedly to have an oil change and transmission oil change on 12/29/2016 at 5:00p.m.. I was told by Angel Bernabe one of their employee that they are about to close and I should go back the following day. With just oil and fluid change Angel Bernabe said it's not gonna take more than an hour. I took my car in 8:00am 12/30/2016 and explained that I need my car before 12pm since I have other appointments.  I was promised a call by Angel Bernabe when it's done.  2hrs after 10:00am I made a follow up and was told that they were calling me (lies) since I didn't receive any calls. I was told that my radiator "NEEDS" flushing because it's low on fluids.  Radiator is 3 months old since I bought it, complete with all the coolant services with it. I was also told that steering fluid needs flushing which is not possible since I check it every week. Meaning they just want more money from the customer. Again a promise of calling me after the job is done.  it's almost 3 in the afternoon which is  6 hours from the promised time of pickup I showed up in the service center. When they saw me, I was told that they are on the phone trying to make a call to inform me for pickup (lies). I picked up my car and told them how disappointed I am with the service and they just shrugged it off and laugh about it. For the first time check engine light went off. A simple oil and fluid change brought me more headaches and a wasted whole day with all their lies. I would never recommend this Service Center. It was very disappointing.<//text>

< Review>
I would give this 10-stars if I could. Magical place to take a walk and enjoy the moments. You enter into a redwood forest with picnic tables and seating, and as you walk further it takes you along a perfect trail around a lake. The walking is flat and easy and the scenery is spectacular! On the walk I saw an egret, horses, and bald eagle. Also it seemed every other person walking was with their dog - every kind of dog imaginable, it was like a free dog show! I took my dog as well and she LOVED trotting along the trails. When we got to the end we ate some sandwiches at the picnic tables while relaxing under a redwood tree. Parking is $7 which is great to support our local parks. It's easy to get here. A true hidden gem!</Review>

<text>If you are having cabin fever as much as I have during this pandemic and looking for a safe place to stretch your body and get out into nature, then I have a treat for you! Today I'm sharing a beautiful place to spend the day in Sonoma County and soak up the sun, while hiking through redwoods, fishing, mediation, and having a safe social gathering at the BBQ and picnic tables with friends and family. 3 tips for visiting @Riverfront Regional Park: Don't forget to wear your mask, bring change to pay for parking because you will get a ticket if you don't, and explore the trails around the ponds! Enjoy Sonoma County!< /text>< Pictures>

Nice spot for a leisurely walk - can be completed in ~1 hour and is flat. Lots of picnic tables under pines near the parking lot and access points to the water for enjoying views/fishing(?). Note the $7 daily usage fee which is made easy to pay as there is a machine that takes cards or you can do the traditional envelope and cash.<//Text>

I love this park! The huge redwood trees at the entrance are gorgeous, with a great picnic area for large groups under their canopy. The trail around the lakes is wide and easy most of the way, until you get to the rocky area between the lakes that requires some scrambling when the water level is high. Nice spot for lake fishing, or head to the Russian River on the edge of the park. Fun trail along the edge of the lake with nice shady spots for relaxing with a good book or picnic. Some years I've seen the egret's nesting and heard the squawks of the chicks high in the trees - it's quite a sight! Great for a peaceful solo hike to enjoy the quiet and beauty, or for families to explore among the trees and catch a fish. And it's only 15 min north of Santa Rosa, right outside of quaint Windsor.</text>

While the parking is $7 all day with no street parking available, the hike was very much a nice serene ~2 mile loop. There are tons of family and dogs. You can certainly have a picnic at the riverfront. There is an open restroom area too.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Beautiful park for family get togethers or other social events. Main area with picnic tables with BBQ grills and volleyball ball courts are well shaded, while other spots are spread out along the trails. There are 2 lakes you can kayak on and fish,  which is well stocked with bass and catfish. Great trails around the lakes for walking that lead to Russian River. Park is always well maintained and easy to access. Well worth the  Regional parks membership fee.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80843d0e5e9704fd:0x86c0fedb52a8a129<//gmapID></record>

<Text>Nice quiet place for a hike. The western most park of the trail is pretty washed out and can get a little sketchy. Lot's of blackberries here, and the ones on the sunny side of the path are the best. Don't go here is you are looking to sit by the Russian River. There are only two real spots and they are small and occupied early.< /Text><Name>Jon Nelson< /Name><date>1500743936256<//date>< pictures>

Here is a peaceful, secluded, quiet area. A perfect place to bike, picnic, go fishing and have group outings. There is a parking fee is less than ten dollars, and the park gates are locked at sundown. At the lakes, you'll usually catch Bluegill fish near the shores, but out on a boat you can catch catfish, steelhead etc...</text>

Very beautiful spot to be in the evening. Sunsets and views are incredible. Bass fishing.. not so wonderful.I have pulled a ten pound catfish out of  the 2nd lake.  Great for BBQ. Has horseshoe pits.  Big enough to take horses for a ride there also.<//review>

<review>Riverfront Regional Park is a Sonoma County Park. You must have a park pass to use park or pay at gate. Not sure what fee is this yr though. I love it because it's an appx 3 mile loop around a beautiful lake. Its a nature trail and. Trail meanders through coastal redwoods, wildflowers, wildlife, birds. There are benches along the way if you need a rest. Restrooms are in the picnic area, set off a bit and the picnic area is centered under a most beautiful grovevof Coast Redwoods. There are other trails too. One is a steep climb. I attempted, but did not finish..(bad knee at time). But seasoned hikers will enjoy. There is no swimming in lake but non motorized boats and fishing are allowed. This park also sits adjacent to the Russian River and There is access to the water though I don't recall seeing much beach. You CAN swim in the river, though it's quite a hike from parking to water. Dogs on leash allowed too and poopy bags are provided as well. Peoples of all ages will enjoy something about this park.</review>< Pictures>

The people who work here are super friendly and the food and coffee are fantastic. The sandwiches are tasty and substantial. My favorite order is half a Ruby’s Veggie with chips. Bagels and pastries are good too! In non-plague times, it’s also a fun and relaxing place to get some work done. Definitely worth a visit.< /Review><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80857e5db1873a77:0xbad11e800410fa03< /gmapID>< time>

We got the fresh mozzarella sandwich and it was a refreshing sandwich.  I also got a Flornetine cookie.  Big open space with plenty of seating available.

This place is also dog friendly!  Staff was nice, friendly and quick with our order.

Got the hot chocolate. It was tasty, though not as robust as others I have had.< /Review>

Great place for a excellent soups and sandwiches, typical cafe fare. Awesome selection of pastries and rotating themed sugar cookies. The owner is a total gem and such a sweetheart. I have been coming here for years and the whole crew knows us and we enjoy coming here often. They don't have a kids menu but it doesn't matter, it's still my 3 young kids' favorite place to go. Highly recommend to everyone!</Text>

<review>My son and I had some business to attend to here in Emeryville. I needed a place to feed him. I walked into Ruby's Cafe with no expectations. I bought a drink and sat down at a table. The atmosphere is cozy, the employees are all very nice. I fed my 9 month son (there are no highchairs in here) the bottle of milk then moved onto solids.

I asked where the napkins and one of the workers,  (manager? Shift supervisor? Owner? He was dressed differently) Albert, offered me a towel to wipe my sons face as i had left my wet wipes in the car.

Very friendly place, Albert checked on my son and i a few times and made sure we were comfortable even though i had just bought a $3 drink the care and attention we received was incredible. Colton even walked out with a toddler sized T-Shirt from this place.

Next time we are in Emeryville we will definitely visit again. This place is awesome and you should give them your business.

Attached is a picture of my son, taken in park across the street :)<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Food was DELICIOUS, staff were polite and genuine. I almost didn't go in because the line seemed long and I had limited time on my lunch break. But the staff moved the line along quickly and made my sandwich quickly. Miss Vickie's chips and Izze drinks, can't beat it.

Glad I discovered this place, will be returning.< /Review>< pictures>

Not many choices for food in area. Only complaint is pricing. $4.25 for a bagel? I understand the rent has to be high in the neighborhood but... I will probably be back but I also frequent airports so I'm used to pocket abuse.< /review>

<text>First all, this was a regular spot for us when we lived around the corner from Mana Cafe'. In the last 2 years this favorite spot had been sold and is under new ownership. As sometimes happens, new ownership means changes and your favorite dishes just ain't the same. I am happy to say, as some of you have already posted, the food is great, the portions are amazing and the service is as friendly as before. Our order was nothing short of plentiful for a small army. The breakfast burger was tasty as well as the veggie omelet. If you're in the mood for some biscuit and gravy, this is a meal in itself. Take a break from cooking and support another great local asset. We sure will be returning for some good food and great service.<//text>< Pics>

Delicious! We were looking for a brunch spot between soccer games, and this was perfect! We live on the other side of town, but we will still definitely be back!<//Text>

The Manna Cafe is an excellent spot for breakfast and lunch. The menu includes all your standard Cafe favorites like Club Sandwiches, Patty Melts, Soups, Salads and more. The breakfast menu is extensive and includes a number of Latin American dishes. The Manna Cafe does have an overtly religious theme and I could understand where that might make some people uncomfortable. It's still well worth the visit though.<//Text>

Since the ownership change, HORRIBLE experience. Not attentive waiters, none would make eye contact or acknowledge customers. Took 20 minutes of waiting to get someone to take our order even after going up to the front to ask if anyone was going to take our order. Never got offered refills of our drinks. Seemed like no one had any initiative to take care of customers. Saw it at multiple tables. Ended up leaving after waiting over 35 to get our food(which we never got) and the waiters excuse was, "sorry it was so busy today..." It wasn't busy dude, y'all just have gone down the toilet. Another customer lost.</text>

We moved in the neighborhood about a year ago and we have been about 5 times now. Their breakfast tacos come on my cravings fairly often. Manna sauce is so good. But more than that, it feels like you're eating what your friend made for you in her kitchen. We love the people and the food. Look forward to supporting them for years to come.

Edit: May 2019 - Seems like ownership has changed. Feel of the location has declined as well as service. We were there for an hour before we left since it took 25 to get the order taken and saw many tables before us never got their food. Sad to lose a great local business.< /text>

Food was okay. I like that they serve GF pancakes (and many other items to choose from, which is rare, at other restaurants)... There was weird pricing on the pancakes. 2 pancakes were more than double the price of 1, and 3 pancakes were more than the price of 1 pancake, times 3.

The restaurant seemed like it could use an update. Our table wobbled, when bumped. And it was really close to the next table. Also, the bathroom looked a little run down. I was surprised that, for the super "North Fresno" location, that it wasn't taken better care of.

The card machine charges a weird fee, that varies, "according to your bank".</text>

<text>Cozy spot. Clean and friendly. However, the waitress did mess up our order and quickly insisted on correcting it. Minor adjustments were made and the breakfast was amazing. Not only that but she didn't not charge for my plate. I thought this was very kind and paid for it anyway and then some because it was that good! Biscuits and gravy...excellent. Chicken fried steak...best I've ever had. Can't say enough about the potatoes. My new favorite breakfast spot. Can't wait to bring my momma!</text><pics>None< /pics>< time>

<Review>I just decided to try this place out of the blue, and I was NOT disappointed! :) The service was so friendly, the food was amazing, and I can definitely say I will be coming back again! Not to mention how cozy it felt in there. There is a wall covered in pictures of the locals so it's wonderful to see that they care about their customers! I'd give it 10 stars if I could! :)

Highly recommend their breakfast burrito! One of the best I've ever had! It's huge though, so bring an appetite! ;)

(Also, for any one in the service, they provide Military discount!)</Review>< pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I wrote a review of this place several months ago when it was a nice family owed establishment and gave it 5 stars.. It has since been bought out and is not quite the same. Even though the menu hasn't changed the quality of the food is nowhere near what it used to be and the smiling friendly staff are no longer there. What a shame. Used to love this place, no longer going to eat there !<//Review>< Pics>

Great little place.  First time there and had 2 eggs over medium with country potatoes.  One of the best country potatoes I've had.  People are very friendly.  I'll definitely be back.<//text>

<Review>BEFORE :  Great family owned restaurant loved going ther due to my daughter having celiac disease. The food was pricey but very good especially having a gluten free child.
NOW:  The service was terrible.  The staff seemed lost?  The food is still priced pretty high.  The atmosphere has change and the food wasn’t as good.  The restaurant was dirty And smelled bad.  My wife and I were very disappointed.
The family mentioned about opening a new location and I hope so.  I (We) won’t be back.< /Review>< pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>This cafe was highly rated online so we decided to try it out. The food was a little pricier than other restaurants that serve similar food, but we are always willing to pay more for delicious food. The place was packed with people so that was a good sign. However, to our disappointment, the food was just mediocre. It wasn't bad and it wasn't anything to rave about. We had high hopes for this place, but it was just okay.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I just love coming to this wonderful gem.   Not only is the food homemade and delicious,  the staff are so kind welcoming and friendly.   If you are a celiac or gluten intolerant,  no worries as they have you covered with plenty of options to choose from.   Three place is small though so you may have a bit of a wait during popular times such as weekends</Review>

Nice menu variety & delicious food. Appreciate the gluten free options on most menu items. The staff is very friendly & accommodating, we've gotten to know the family that works there & they always remember us & are genuinely happy to serve us. You can tell they love their jobs & do it with a joyful heart. They even put up pictures & flyers of locals & Fresno businesses. My Grandparents were frequent customers & had gotten to know the staff very well so they put up the program from my Grandpa's funeral after he passed, which was very kind. Great family atmosphere for sure! Our favorite after church lunch spot on Sundays :)</Text>

Breakfast is awful and took way too long to be served. Food was cold and steak was not a rib eye steak...looked more like a Carne Asada.<//review>

Went there last Friday for lunch, had a Toco salad, was great! I almost licked the plate clean, but I didn't want to embarrass my friend. Thank goodness it's right down the street from where I live, planning on going there often.< /review>

There is a reason this place just got voted best in our hood, cuz they are! Right now you can get a double cheeseburger with amazing fries and a drink for 5.99 (and hang out with a friend and listen to Christian music!)< /Text>

I just came to the store on Thursday and I loved it !

All the aisles are organized and clean ❤️

I found these two beautiful long skirts

Then today I came back 4/19/21
And got some body wash and face stuff !

They have really good deals and I definitely love this store better !

Can’t wait to come back 💕🙏🏽❤️<//review>

<text>I had a return and it was one week after the purchase. But the cashier was unwilling to put the amount back on my card and insisted on giving me a gift card. I asked for the manager and they said that no manager was available. I asked them to process my return properly and finally someone came to help and I got my money back on my card. The cashier didn't even appologize. In addition to all that you can hardly ever find someting there that is worth wearing.</text>< Response>

<review>I was blown away by the selection of goodies. For the longest time I avoided this place thinking “I don’t need a coat.” From formals to electronics (my personal recent  purchases) they have had everything I’ve needed and wanted. The customer service I’ve received has also been beyond exceptional. Thank you so much for expanding my shopping horizons.</review>< gmapID>

It means so much to me to see local "For Profits" partnering in the community with the "Non Profits" to help attract and retain Digital Natives or iGen's.  These individuals are the future! Not to mention the store was clean, tidy, and well stocked when I was in there yesterday.  Super friendly staff.  I haven't seen Fernando Cetina in the recruiting world in some time, it would be nice to do a meet and greet with the hiring team.  Find me on LinkedIn!< /Review><gmapID>0x80dc75ac7edc64ff:0x2eb056946e4b33c7<//gmapID>< UserId.>

<review>Found exactly what I needed at an exceptional price.  Rocawear shorts for $5 and jeans for $6.

The dressing rooms were clean and easily accessible.  The usual assortment of needles on the floor and seating was totally absent!

Check out was efficient and reasonably fast.  I waiting in line for maybe 90 seconds.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I am currently an employee here, and have been for nearly 3 months. I love our deals and we always have new things coming in, not only is there name brand items, there is name brand items for almost every part of your home!

Things I've had customers ask for, that we dont have much of:
-Electronics such as TVs, radios &/or DVD players/systems. Though we do carry household decor like lamps, magnifying mirrors & charger ports/cords/adapters.
-Sometimes, though very limited: school supplies such as planners & art supplies,  though we do carry journals.< /Review>< Rate>

Eh. I've been to better ones. This one in Vista CA is rather small and the selection in men's and women's clothing seems to be other stores rejects. Prices are always good there though, so you might get lucky.<//review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>This store is just off of the 78 but is a little tucked-in behind some walls and trees so at first it was confusing how to get to the store itself. Store itself was so-so and it can be a bit dark in the area at night. But they do have great deals on various items. Got several baby items in here that are far cheaper than the more popular stores.<//review>< pictures>

<review>The pricing was screwy on some things. Three completely identical items (same size, color, manufacturer) had three different prices. When I asked about, they nonchalantly explained it away saying they weren't 100% sure why they were differently priced. "Maybe they came in different shipments". I don't like sketchy pricing practices. It's likely I won't be back. The cashiers seemed more interested in socializing with each other than taking care of customers.< /review>< pictures>

I always feed hassled here, seems like the staff are rude 80% of the time... Not always, but usually. There's a huge selection of clothes downstairs and upstairs is half baby things and housewares. Good prices for clothes, I prefer Ross for house hold items.</Text>

The dive bar of discount clothing. Fond memories of finding the killer deal on great stuff back in the day. Go in a decade or so later and it hasn't aged well. There is also a bump in sales tax for shopping in Vista.<//review>

<text>Horrible customer service and terrible management. Staff was so unfriendly. No greeting, no thank you, no have a nice day/night just straight out rude.I asked the 1st staff for a gift receipt she didn't give it to me. I had to drive back to get one. When a new staff told me they where closing, I told her that I have asked for a gift receipt and I was not given one. She immediately was not happy that she had to do an extra work. After giving me the gift receipt she only said "here" with a very unfriendly expression & tone basicly I didn't even get an apology for making me come back for a receipt I have asked for in the first place. The 1st one that helped me was the supervisor of the day, imagine if this is how management treat their customer can't expect much from this store. I had way better treatment at Ross.<//text>< pictures>

<text>YOU MUST READ THIS!  BUYER BEWARE AT ANY Burlington!  If you go home and wash your purchases and they shrink, THEY WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK.

It's COMPANY POLICY.  One day, after buying $ 100+ worth of clothing, I had to return because everything shrunk.  Their products did not match was I tried on in the fitting room and bought.

You know what they said I could do with these shrunk clothes?  They said I could "donate it".

Donate it?!

I wonder if corporate cares if they lost me forever as a customer?

Tell your friends and family.  Burlington doesn't refund your money if their products are faulty.

You know why they are "just Burlington" now?  Cuz now they are just like all the other lackluster stores like Ross and Marshalls.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dc75ac7edc64ff:0x2eb056946e4b33c7<//Gmap_id>< userid>

Burlington isn't my cup of tea. Things are, for the most part, "discounted," but it's not spectacular and nothing you wouldn't find in sale prices at JCPenny, IMO. The Men's Big & Tall section was ok, but much of it you can find on sale at other stores and/or the brands tend to be knockoffs. The store feels kinda ghetto, and I don't throw that around often. I went there for a wallet, found one I liked that wasn't overly expensive, and that was that. Will I go back? Probably not. That's not a knock on the store, it's just not my kind of store.< /Text>

I love Burlington Coat Factory, there hasn't been a store I don't spend money in easily... until this store. The store wasn't well lit. The clothing and shoes seemed cheap and dated. The jewlery was gawdy. The children's clothing seemed picked through and wasn't well stocked. The men's shoes were a joke, more open space than shoes and the styles were ridiculous. The staff seemed courteous enough, but the whole store lacked appeal.</text>

The manager (Hailey) had the audacity to tell me "alot of customers didn't get that right this year".. I imagine that is because the promotional email you sent out NEVER said it had to be a plastic card.

It is nearly impossible to navigate and by the time you get ready to check out it keeps telling you that certain items are out of stock and to go in and remove them from your cart.

< review>
The low impact in this business is when is time to pay.  First of all if u dnt likeur job u should quit and let others take the position u have. When costumers aprocah to registers to pay they dnt greet and say nothing unless someone breaks the ice. Really. Am paying for what am buying and u have a job thanks to costumers. please fix this. IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN U PAY FOR WHAT U LIKE BUT RECEIVE THE WORST COSTUMER EXPERIENCE WHEN PAYING. I FEEL LIKE JUST LEAVING EVERYTHING IN THE COUNTER. PLEASE PLEASE. GREET YOUR COSTUMERS AND ACT AS IF U REALLY WANT THEM BACK AT LEAST.
This place is huge and has great bargains i love a place with variety and options. From clothing to home decorations i always find something to do business.
But the costumer experience is a dilema when it comes to chosing where to go shop.<//review>

Poorly organized, nice staff, it feels like a giant bargain bin, but the prices aren't as low as you would hope.< /text>

We want to thank all the staff at Burlington, Vista CA - we reported that my wife lost or misplace her Coach sunglasses and the next day they called us and told us the sunglasses were found.  Thank you soooo much.</review>

< Review>
I've been gaming with a group of buddies here on Tuesday nights for around a decade. The staff is friendly, the floors and bathrooms clean, the food competent; I do the all you can eat pizza and salad bar, and there's plenty of options (even for a vegetarian). There's even a 4 seat bar, so if we want a beer, we can grab a cold one. There's also a couple of different TVs that we can usually get turned off if we want, though they're not loud enough to be objectionable either (we watched the news on election night 2016 while we gamed). It's a Round Table in a strip mall, what else can I say?< /Review>

All I wanted was to place a order for a pizza and he gave me such a hard time. No professionalism at all. Then when I asked for a manager, he told me that they didn't have one on duty. I really want him fired. This is ridiculous. He's a representation on your company. Just horrible.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>I got my oil changed on my wife's car and she told me the engine sounded weird after so I popped the hood to notice they left her air filter open on her car for the week she was driving it.

Hands down the best Jiffy Lube in Southern California. These guys know what they're doing and are honest people. Super hard to find mechanics that are honest with customers and who go the extra mile to make sure your car is running the way it should. Thanks guys<//Text>

Update: 9/23/20 I had my oil changed and the tires rotated. As always, the service was great, the staff was super friendly and the prices very reasonable. I'll go back for my next oil change for sure. I stayed in my car the entire time because of COVID precautions and that worked out great.

1.5 hour wait all day on Tuesday. But I'll go back when possible. They're always good.</text>

< review>
The manager Ascari Valdez is the most honest, hardworking professional I’ve ever experienced at any mechanic or oil change I’ve been to.  I’ve had bad experiences with mechanics before so I’m always skeptical, Ascari exceeded all my expectations.  I had an issue with a oil tank  plug and was turned away by Pep Boys, and told at Midas it would be and extra $100.  Ascari told me he could do it, and didn’t charge me any extra.  Great guy, I’ll be back.</review>

I'm sharing this because I know most people do not know much about auto maintenance/repair and are always at the mercy of the shops they visit.
For over two decades, I have been having oil changes for all my family's cars at the La Paz Jiffy Lube location with no problems.  I went there yesterday for an oil change and they first tried to sell me synthetic, while my car's manufacturer recommends regular oil ($50 more for synthetic).  They insisted that the manufacturer is not right, and they go by their own book. When I declined they got upset and became visibly rude.  Then they drained the oil for less than 10 seconds, and all of a sudden, they began filling the oil. When I questioned if they allowed all the oil to drain and if they changed the filter, they became furious and told me they do not need my business. They got upset because they were caught. When I got home, I checked the oil and it was not fully clean and the oil filter had not been changed.  I am warning all my neighbors not to go to this location, as they will surely be scammed.  They could not do that to me because I was a mechanic many years ago and I know how things work around cars and garages. I have reported them to the Consumer Affairs-Department of Automotive Repair.  If you have had a scam experience with them or any other garage, you should take a couple of minutes to file a complaint.</review>

Went to 2 other shops who said they couldn't really see or diagnose the problem! Jiffy lube immediately saw that water pump was leaking, and explained they couldn't do the flush. I went to the shop I usually go to who confirmed this and is repairing it!! Thanks for being observant who knows how long the water pump had that slow leak. This would have led to huge problems in the future.
Thanks again!!<//text>< pics>

Went their today at 7:30am  there were 4 cars ahead and 2 docks they said wait time 1.5 hrs. Then I have a Toyota tacoma 4cyl. He says I have to buy a blended synthetic oil its $59.00 also $8.00 for oil filter and $24 for tire rotation . My Estimate was $101.00 I told him I thought that was  way to much. He said 1.5 Hr wait so I decide to see how much Ramona Tire would charge since I'm walking around . They tell me  $44.00 for same oil and includes filter and $12 for tire rotation. Thats a $44.00 difference .  Then I called the dealer and They only recommend full synthetic and there price for all the work will full synthetic was $75.00 out the door.
I will be going to Ramona Tire for my next oil change. I would have pulled my service order but there 1.5hr wait turned into 10 min. Smart! because I would have been out of there!</Review>

<text>The Jiff Lube at La Paz in Mission Viejo has an EXCELLENT customer service. Arturo and his team did a great job taking care of my car during the oil change. I will definitely be coming back.

They seem to genuinely care about their customer (very rare now a days)

< Review>
I arrived for an oil change at 6:20pm, they close at 7:00pm. The employee told me it would be a 20 minute wait (still leaving 20 minutes before they close). When I said okay he said that the guys want to go home so I'd have to come back the next day. I went somewhere else.< /Review>

<Text>Do not take you diesel for fuel filter they have no clue
Been here three hour still can't get it started
Worst service
Absolutely not qualified
And will not go back
Would rather pay twice as much than ruin my sat
3 hours still waiting
Joke
That's 1200  plus $ a year less for ifffy lube</Text>< pictures>

<review>Cerrone's has serviced 3 different Mini's we've owned over a period of many years. It is easy to make appointments. They provide a detailed inspection report after checking out the car. Their work is accurate, fairly priced, and fixes whatever problem they identified. We've never had to return the car because a problem wasn't fixed right. And they're nice people!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I recently bought a 94 Land Rover Defender 90 NAS and I wanted the Cerrone team to look it over and take care of any immediate needs. We are not working out various modifications we want to do. Frank was extremely helpful and it is clear this is THE shop in the Bay Area for Defenders.<//Review>

Brought my car in for spark plugs, Frank had the car to me a few hours later. These guys are legit, thorough service, no B.S. They even found out that my k&n filter had to much oil on it (my fault) and made me aware to potential problems.  Thumbs up for these guys. I Will be back.<//text>

<text>I get my car serviced here for maintenance items (oil change etc.). Excellent workmanship. They are very professional in setting up appointments, and provide a very detailed diagnostic report every time with pictures and recommendations. Pricing is very good considering the car make.

<Text>Very professional service. I’m someone who likes to see what people are talking about, and even with a request, Frank offered to send pictures of the problems with my Land Rover 4. Also, he made a report for me about the important things that I need to take care of on my car.

Anne told me to drop off the car on Friday at 8 am, and they'd try their best to get it repaired.  I picked up the car that afternoon. I want to say that the communication with Anne via phone and text is outstanding. I was always updated on the status of diagnosis and repair. It's so nice to do business with a firm with such excellent service.</review>< Name>

I found Cerrone's on Land Rover's preferred service providers website.  The dealer quoted me 3500 for the work and Cerrone's quoted me 2500. I had a great experience, he showed me the faulty parts when I picked up my car and explained everything in detail.  My car is runnng so much better now.  I am very happy I found Cerrone's.  I will have all my future service done there instead of the dealership.

This team provides excellent service with care and quality. I've been a customer for years because of their excellent customer care and quality repair work. They provide a detailed summary of recommended repairs and walk me through each one to make it as easy as possible to assess which repairs to complete now and which to schedule for a future appointment. They are candid, authentic and fair. I recommend them highly.< /Text>

Frank and Anne and Tyler were very friendly, courteous, respectful and gave my daughter's 2013 Mini Cooper a thorough going-over and recommended a set of maintenance and repair items that made total sense, including rear brakes.  I feel comfortable that my daughter will have a safe car to drive again.  Thanks Cerrones!</Review>

I can't say enough good things about my first experience with Cerrone's.  I drive a 2007 Range Rove HSE and believed I needed a new transmission per the Land Rover dealership's inspection; however, in working with Frank, it turns out the transmission was in good order it was simply a transmission leak created by a busted seal (put simply I’m certain it was more complicated than that).  Cerrone's provided me detailed diagnostics (never received that from the dealership) and installed a new seal / pan and sleeve and replaced the transmission fluid, which was significantly cheaper.  Frank rechecked the diagnostics to clear all the issues to ensure that was the issue and double checked all work before returning it to me.  Phenomenal.  My Range Rover is running well. Thank you!<//review>

They couldn't have been nicer nor more prompt with the service.  The report they send you once they receive the car and prepare it for service you requested is beyond compare.  Through, tons of pictures, recommendations all with no pressure.  Just a full check up on your car.  This is a very reputable place to do business with!  Thank you Cerrone's European!!!<//text>

I had an old BMW 1987 E30, and they did  a good job with whatever I brought it in for.  When they contacted me about estimates, they were detailed, and I felt I had the information I needed to make decisions.  Labor can be expensive on work that they do, but I think they're one of the more reasonably priced shops on the Peninsula that works on European cars, as everything around here is expensive.</Text>

Cerrone's European specializes in servicing Jaguar's and Land Rovers. I have found the owner to be very honest, and the work performed has been first class.
I own a Jaguar and found both San Francisco Jaguar and San Jose Jaguar lacking in customer service and competence...high prices and shoddy service.< /Text>

My car's air conditioning was acting strangely just as I was on the freeway for a long journey.  An error message came on as well. My car to Annie was greeted with a "bring it here now". That gave such a wonderful feeling. I always feel so welcome  and confident in your abilities. Even though I only occasionally go to Redwood City now, I get excellent service. Thank you!!< /review>

We are so happy we found Cerrone's. After my range rover passed the warranty mark, it just made so much more sense to step away from the dealership and I felt lucky to find Cerrone's. Frank and Annie are quality people and they provide impeccable service. We highly recommend Cerrone's!</review>

When my uncle gave me his 1997 Jaguar XK8, I started looking for a reputable shop for evaluation and care.  I was most impressed by the reviews for Cerrone’s.  I now know why the reviews were overwhelmingly stellar.  Cerrone’s provides the most comprehensive services and customer service I have ever encountered.  Annie’s support and knowledge are unsurpassed, as are Eric’s and Frank’s.  They have a customer for life. Highly recommend!<//Text>

<Text>Frank and Anne were professional and knowledgeable. I didn’t feel I needed a second option as I trusted the family business feel of what they felt was fair pricing. They also have me a loaner car when I had to leave mine. Super easy and convenient! Will definitely keep returning. :)< /Text>< Pictures>

I needed last minute help before a weekend roadtrip. Late on a Friday I called my dealer and they said "nope, too late." I called Cerrone's and they said "come by as soon as you can and we will do what we can." They got me ready and on my way when no one else would. And they did it right! Thank you!<//Review>

This  place was fantastic!!  We were welcomed into the place with open arms and they were very forthcoming about what needed to be done.  They sent an email with pictures of the car of items that needed looking at and repaired in the future. I was blown away by their customer service
The price of the repairs was below what three other places had quoted me.  They were kind, respectful and happy to help.  Thank you so much and we will be back with our other European cars!!< /Text>

Hey! What a quality place of business! My first experience with them was very customer service oriented and professional. They really knew their stuff, and explained things to me in a way that I grasp on quickly. This experience and earning my trust led me to bring in another vehicle that I had sitting around the house. They got this one up and going as well. You can't go wrong bringing your whip (vehicle) to Cerrone's European!< /review>

Loved my experience at Cerrone's. Found them searching for a shop that was certified to work on my Volvo without voiding the extended warranty. Saved me about $500 from the dealer quote for my 75k service!! The service was fast and transparent, the part ordered actually ended up being less than what I was quoted, which I was let know and my price ended up being less than what I was ready to pay. The explanation of everything done to the car was carefully detailed in a pdf emailed to me with pictures, so I had the peace of mind that everything was being accounted for. I will definitely take my car there for my next service.< /review>

Tony & Frank have always been fair and honest when it comes to working on my Land Rovers.  Anne always keeps me informed with the status of my vehicle.  I cant recommend a better shop that works on Land Rovers.

I highly recommend Cerrone's when it comes to any kind of service for your vehicle.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I have only the best to say about Cerrone’s. Having no knowledge of cars...it has been my worst fear. I took the list of repairs that my Mini dealer recommended, to Cerrone’s. They came back with cheaper quote and also something that Mini advised to change, they said that it was not necessary and saved me the expense. They guided me to a great body shop when my car got dinged by someone on the road.
And my last trip to them, Anne explained in detail about what happened when my car stalled on the highway. And how they fixed it.
I feel like they took good care of my car and helped me understand better. I hope that my trips to them are not often, but if I need to...I trust them with my Mini!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1531604349319, 'text': 'Thanks Anju, we appreciate your kind words'}< /response>< gmapID>

Anthony, Frank and Annie have been nothing but professional and friendly people. I have been a customer since 2010 with my Range Rover Sport and still continuing to work with them.  They are honest people and only do the work necessary for your car. Unlike other places or even dealers who try to take you for all you've got. Their prices are fair and much less than the dealership since they don't have to pay for all the overhead. It's nice to have work done on my car and know that I am working with honest people.< /Review>

<review>If you've ever wished that a trusted family member was also an ace auto mechanic so that you could get the real scoop on what needs to be done with your car, then this is the place to go. I trust them to give me not only great service but also honest advice. I found them after I gave up on the local Audi dealership. A piece of my rear bumper kept falling off and, after three visits to the dealership that included multiple parts orders, the dealer still couldn't fix the problem. Cerrone's solved it in one visit for a fraction of the cost I'd already racked up at the dealership. I am even considering going to Cerrone's for my regularly scheduled service visits, even though I prepaid for them at the dealership. I think it will ultimately  be more economical with better results.< /review><username>Amy Pressman<//username><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>I  needed to have my Car's control arm bushings fixed. After reading the excellent reviews on Cerrone's I decided to give them a call. Not only were they able to take my car on that same day and get it fixed in a few hours, but also offered me a loaner while they were doing the repairs.
My recent experience with them was terrific.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fa3a75afeadeb:0x7657ebe51d32a8b3< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I brought my BMW E90 here for service (oil change), and had an awesome experience. The team are nothing but experts and gave me a full picture of my car's health; with the oil change service, they also gave me pointers on what to expect in terms of future service.
Would recommend to anyone who wants to take a proactive approach to maintaining their car (proper care = an ounce of prevention!). Finding a team that you can fully entrust your car with is not easy, but I'm very glad I found Cerrone's< /Text>

<Text>Cerrone's provided a fair, accurate estimate and communicated proactively when it became clear that the problem would not be easily (read "not without significant cost") repaired. They adjusted what they could to reduce the problem. I appreciated the candor in suggesting that I not try to make the expensive repair to my 17-year-old car.<//Text>< pictures>

I always have peace of mind when dropping my truck off at Cerrone's European, which is no small feat with my heavily modified Discovery 2. They know Land Rovers inside out and can give advice for both stock and aftermarket parts. The service is top notch, and they are always the first place I recommended to anyone looking to have their Rover worked on.</text>

However, my Mini Cooper also had a "Check Engine" light on - I suspect due to the fact that the battery was failing.  Cerrone's European did a quick test of my check engine light and didn't charge me for checking into it.  They didn't believe it was anything serious, and reset the check engine light.  And best of all, they didn't charge me anything extra for checking on the check engine light. Always appreciate the "free extra" service that you get from Cerrone's European.</review>< response>

<Review>Excellent services. Prompt responses via e-mail and phone by owner and staff. They applied extra efforts to resolve issues with replacement parts by contacting OEM vendors and 3rd party automotive businesses on my behalf. Final costs for major engine repairs less than original estimates. Superior vehicle knowledge for Land Rover models. Established trust with detailed inspection summaries, hands-on explanations covering failed/worn parts, and gave honest opinions about available options for each of their service recommendations.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Frank was great diagnosing and fixing the problem with my '97 Land Rover.  I peppered him with lots of questions (engine swaps, exhaust sytems, new paint and soft tops) and he had informed answers for everything I asked.   My Defender runs a lot better now, I'll be taking it back next time it needs some work.<//review>

<review>We absolutely love using Cerrone's. This is a family business and the folks are incredibly friendly.  They do an excellent job on our vehicle and provide an estimate and explanation for the work that needs to be done. I highly recommend Cerrone's.< /review><Name>Jamie Bailey< /Name>< gmap_id>

Franks was great! Straight shooter and very professional. Was able to decider the issues with my NAS defender 90 and get them sorted out quickly earning my trust for future maintenance and issues to come up.</Review>

They trouble shoot, no bogus extra work, and flex their schedules to fit you as best they can.  My former Land Rover and Jaguar were serviced for many years there.  They also have solid relationships with ancillary service providers nearby (tires, etc.).  I use them now for my Porsche and new Range Rover Evoque.  These guys love being "greasey" and getting to the root cause of problems and also do solid preventive maintenance.  But most importantly, they are honest and ethical, and that's hard to find.  Once I find it I never stray.

Recently had a fairly major repair job (replacing throttle mechanism). The standard repair manual specified a wrong part. They caught the mistake, substituted the correct part, and gave me a bill for $700 under the original estimate. I've never had that happen before.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>I brought a vehicle to Cerrone's for a pre-purchase inspection.  Was I ever impressed!  They found a few items that would have been very costly to fix, and gave me some great advice on negotiating the price on the car.  I was extremely impressed with their thorough explanations and written reports, as well as the report that was emailed to me.  That report contained photos of the items they uncovered, as well as clickable links to get more information on the items and the repairs.

I wound up purchasing the vehicle and will DEFINITELY be bringing in to them for all of the services in the future!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Cerrone's service is always courteous, fast, expert, honest, and cost-conscious. They also stand behind their work--one time a new part failed after a couple of months and they replaced it free of charge. They have gone beyond the call of duty to solve difficult problems for me on more than one occasion--it is a joy to drive a Jaguar, but the cars frequently have materials problems, especially early in the product lifetime (mine is the first year of the model). The free rental car is a real help. I drive a considerable distance to Redwood City for service and repairs because I know I can always rely on Tony and Frank. I recommend taking their advice on prophylactic repairs--the one time I did not do so, I lived to regret it.</text>

<text>I have been a client here for more years than I care to admit!.  The reason my 30 year old Peugeot (which has been the 'dog car' for the last 20) is still running is because of Frank and Jim Cerrone and their team.  Always honest and the work is done expertly.  I highly recommend Cerrone's for your vehicle.  Their Dad would be proud!

After taking my Jaguar to a mechanic who only dealt with foreign cars, and then to the Jaguar dealership, only to be told that they couldn't find the problem that the computer kept showing, I went to Cerrone's European and they checked the car for several days, found the problem and solved it. That was eight years ago and thanks to them, I'm still driving that same Jaguar today.<//text>

Our carpets are almost 20 years old and we have pets. The young man that cleaned our carpets was very respectful and explained the services well. He did an excellent job cleaning our carpets and rugs. The pricing is very affordable and fair. Highly recommend this company!<//text>

The tech that came out for my cleaning was very professional. He made it a point to inspect the carpet thoroughly and explain the services they offer clearly and help me pick what services were best for my space. Their costs were fair in respects to the job they did. He worked very efficiently and explained different parts of the process to me when he was doing them so I understood what he was doing. I had multiple spots of pet messes from an incontinent older dog and housebreaking a pup and they did a great job of removing them. I would definitely use them again and recommend them to friends & family.<//review>

I’ve used ChemDry for many years and would never consider using anyone else. With multiple cats in the family, our carpet is always a challenge but Rob and Joe are so nice and very thorough and efficient. The carpet looks amazing when they leave.<//text>

This is an amazing company that handled business properly. They are very nice, professional, courteous and they know what they are doing. We've used them many times and they are our first call. This last time they were booked up for a couple weeks and we needed the carpet cleaned to get the house on the market. We were going to have to wait but because the house was waiting to go to market on the carpet cleaning they kept us in mind when they had a cancellation and got is in 5 days early! The house went to market the next day because of this. We are so grateful and thankful to Chem-Dry for taking such good care of us! Top notch service and top notch people!<//Text>

AV Chem-Dry for the win! Not only did they come out and sanitize my 2,400 sq. ft home with just a moments notice but they offered me a military (Veteran) discount and holiday rate. They are professional, on-time, and they did a great job, highly recommend!</text>

Professional service, Friendly employees, careful with moving furniture and placings back to their location.  Gave good direction as far as future care of carpet. Gave information of pricing before work began.  Gave free spot cleaning product when hib was completed.</Review>

Rob did a great job cleaning our office carpets.  The carpets looked so much better plus he spayed a sanitizer on them.  I asked for a call about 30 minutes before arrival and he was right on time.  We will definitely use them again.<//Review>

I was using another company. I was not happy with the company I was using before because when they were done the room did not look or smell clean. I have 3 indoor dogs 🐶 so I have my one huge family room cleaned every 7 months.  I decided to try Chem Dry. I am so happy I did.  The service is superb. I love, love how they cleaned my carpet. Chem Dry is who I will be calling every 7 months. Great 👍🏻 job.< /Text>

These people were fantastic.  After my mother passed unexpectedly, I needed the carpets cleaned in her house before all the family arrived.  Lisa understood my ASAP status, and scheduled me for the next possible appointment.  Two days later she called me with a cancellation and my carpets were cleaned that day.  By technicians who were thorough yet fast, and even did my stairs for free.  Fantastic job, fantastic customer service, and affordable! Would highly recommend.< /Text>

My carpet is 12 years old. I have 2 pets and my female is stubborn to say the least. My carpet is sparkling. I can’t believe it for the age of the carpet

I have went to west side Chem Dry from the beginning. Try a cheap outfit once about 5 yrs ago. Never again. Worth every penny and they are reasonable.
Happy Customer 12 years. First review!

Same thing a new yr. 13 yrs now!! Carpet still sparkles</text>

The team was very professional. Before starting the job they wanted to know the cause of the fabric stain to ensure satisfaction once the job was complete and whether they could in fact guarantee removal of the stain. In fact they asked if they could do a test first and if it worked they would proceed with cleaning. Once the test was run we agreed to proceed. After the cleaning was done, from what we could tell the stain was gone. And since the fabric was dampened they even promised to come back if, once it dried, the stain returned. This is excellent service!<//Review>

<Text>Very happy with the carpet cleaning I received several months ago.  It stayed nice for some months, as opposed to other carpet cleaning services I have received in the past. With kids and animals, it is always a struggle to keep things nice for any length of time, but their cleaning method really does the trick, and I felt the house was truly "sanitized" .  I will be contacting them again in the near future.  I only hope I get the same technician (he was awesome!!) I just can't recall his name, so I hope they keep good records.  A little pricier than perhaps other services, but well worth it.  Highly recommend!!!< /Text>< GmapID>

I was sooo pleased with Joe's work this morning and every time he comes here. He is always very professional. He explains what he is going to do and he does just what he says. I am very glad I called Chem Dry. It smells good and fresh. Thank you Joe. Stay safe.</text>

<text>Thank you John for doing a great job on our office carpeting. The carpet turned out great and you even gave us a bottle of spot remover on the house, wow, thank you !!  If you want your carpet to be professionally cleaned by a professional, then you have got to call John!  He makes cleaning carpets look easy, but we all know what a pain it is to try and clean a carpet ourselves...a huge headache...so call John today, you will be glad you did and so will your back!  Thanks again John !!</text><Date>1527870022314<//Date></record>

John and crew came out and did a great job on our carpets. they were targeted by a friends dog.  all of the chemicals were removed and treated, this is not just carpet cleaning, this is innovation.  Thanks so much for helping us save our carpets.  I recommend the Chem Dry guys 100%.  Norm< /review>

<Review>Chem Dry guys showed up when they said they would and were friendly and easy to deal with.  I had a 30+ year old oriental rug that had some damage. It looks marvelous now, better than I expected. They also to out a nasty spot on my living room carpet. I was very pleased and would use them again.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c25c74b556bed3:0xb3c148586041d5d6< /gmap_id>< username>

<review>Chem- dry helped me out with some VERY bad cat urine damage to carpet.  Working with them was a breeze they are nice, helpful and understanding. They came in and did the first treatment and the smell was so much better, although not completely removed.  When I called to discuss this they didn't waste any time setting up another appointment to get someone out to me again.  The second time helped even more, although I have a nose like a hound and I can still pick up on the smell at times.  I believe in the product if you're working with minor to mediocre stains/smells.  For the real troubled areas (like mine) the product will make them 10 times better but not...perfect.< /review><GmapID>0x80c25c74b556bed3:0xb3c148586041d5d6</GmapID><userid>116811044277419908864< /userid><Date>1500394314445<//Date>< rate>

My friend and I were really craving a healthy, delicious juice and this place hit the spot! Not only were the juices very yummy (and most importantly, good for you!), the customer service was amazing. We were waited on by Niku, who was fantastic! Thank you, Niku!!!< /Text>

<Text>Love this place but have to give 3 stars. The last 2 times I've gone to get something the kid working says he's on break and we have to come back later. I'm not sure how you can stay in business when locals can't even depend on this place to be open.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place is awesome! Juice was absolutely delicious, kind and quick service and even a discount offered if you tag them on Instagram.
Highly recommended!</Text>

< Review>
Was very disappointed by the bubble tea, the tapioca/boba wasn’t chewy AT ALL, worse I have ever tasted. Obviously, they don’t know how to cook tapioca properly because they probably left the tapioca to freeze for days which is a BIG MISTAKE. If you don’t know how to make bubble tea, don’t !!!< /Review>

Dont go there. 20 min for a juice. One guy who takes orders and makes juices.  Spent too much time for what was suppose to be a quick refreshing experience.

They even refused to refund a client who was waiting a long time and didn't want his drink (before it was made)

Bad!</Text>

Looked like a popular place, saw they had boba tea so we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, they only had very limited items available.</text>

I’m visiting LA and, while spending the day exploring Venice, I found this place on google maps. I decided to go so I got on a Bird scooter and rode here. When I arrived and was getting off the scooter, the guy working came out and was SUPER RUDE to me, asking “what is this, the parking zone?”. I was friendly and he continued to be rude, so I wasn’t comfortable going in. I turned to go to the Starbucks across the street instead and he yelled after me “not too many walks on the beach for you, huh?”. I’m not totally sure what he meant by that but I certainly felt insulting. I left this interaction feeling really bad, leading to this post. I certainly don’t want to take my business anywhere who’s employees treat people like this.</Review>

Came here with my nephews after a nice bike ride. All of our smoothies and juices were delicious! I had a beet juice with boba pearls. The staff were friendly and seemed very passionate about their business and healthy foods. Recommended!< /text>

<Text>!!!DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ORDER when you get it!!! They notoriously get my order wrong, I’ve had to return items 5 times now because they forgot an ingredient or fruit or granola that I ask for specifically. I love this place, but if there’s more than 1 person in line in front of you, save yourself time and move on. :(<//Text>< Name>

<review>I am vacationing in Santa Monica and this place has the best ingredients and staff!! I popped in after a day of way too much sun and (and let's be honest, a couple of bad food choices) with a swollen face and hands, and beginning to panic little, I had the Vita Blood cold- pressed juice and said "heavy on the Turmeric, I have to get this swelling down" They loaded me up!! Adding extras to kick the allergy response my body was experiencing, and keeping me hydrated, they were so caring and compassionate!! Within 30 mins I was feeling much better and swelling had gone down 60%. Thank you for being so kind!! Oh and I went back for the Ruby Liquid Refreshment...Wow!! Everything tastes great, you can feel the vibracy!!</review>< Pics>

<Text>Worst juice bar I ever visited in my life! The service was terrible, the juice maker guy was SO rude! The juices I ordered tasted horrible and when I mentioned that I got 16 oz, even though I paid for 24 oz, he told me to "go do chemistry outside" and waved his hands to direct me to the door!!!
Seriously, don't go there!< /Text><user_id>114510443452180848376< /user_id>< Time>

I was on a 15 minute break and I was walking by and decided to get a quick snack and noticed that in side was very dirty. I left immediately, I recommend going to a real Acai bar, boba juice bar they don't even know what they're doing and how to make it. not one that can get you sick.They use dirty utensils to make your food etc and unfiltered water. Everything there I notice made me want to throw up. Places like this should be shut down.👎👎👎 will definitely notify Health Department.< /text>

Açai bowl is not the best. They mix it with ice and gets liquid, like a juice. Flavor is also not the best, it doesn't taste as real açai. Portion isn't generous for a 8$ bowl. Half of the bowl is banana. But service is good.<//Text>

I absolutely love the food here! Almost everything is a bit spicy so be prepared! The century eggs were my favorite, and they were displayed beautifully! There was a wait to be seated but it's definitely worth it. The area is a little bit dark but that just adds to the atmosphere m even though you are seated next to others, you definitely feel like you have your own space.  The waiters and waitresses were very timely to serve our needs this time.<//Review>

I just got it to go. And it’s still delicious. The service is quick. And once you place a phone order, you can pick up in 10-20 mins. The lady over the phone her name is Michelle. She is fantastic.

Gave this place a try with no expectations, the food did not disappoint. We ordered the chongqing spicy chicken, steamed fish with two flavor chili, and steamed eggplant with string bean. The fish was way larger than expected and was packed in a large serving tray. Everything was delicious, but I took off one star because the price was different from what's shown online and it came out to be more than expected.< /review>

Ping's Bistro #2: The bento boxes really suck and not tasty. Such a disappointment. Ordered fried pork and it was over-cooked. Who is the chef? 1st month in the kitchen?
Front desk service was not bad, but quote slow. I was late for 30 mins and my order was still not ready. Overall, bad experience and won't recommend and won't return.<//review>

<Date>1571716636291< /Date><review>Best authentic Chinese food that I have had outside of China! I visited China a few years ago and being a vegetarian was worried about finding viable food options. To my surprise, there was a huge selection available at most Chinese restaurants and most importantly it was very tasty; quite different than the typical Chinese food served in the States. Last evening I was thrilled to eat at Ping's Bistro. Brought back nostalgic memories of the great vegetarian food I ate in China! Highly recommended!!<//review></record>

Good Chinese food. It’s a hidden gem. Located in a not so great looking strip mall. It’s kinda hidden in a corner. Usually very busy. Tried Mapu tofu and loved it. My friend loved the food so much he couldn’t stop eating.< /Text>

<Review>This one is so popular. Go there 11:00 at noon or 5:30 afternoon to avoid waiting. Most dishes are spicy but soooo tasty. Authentic cuisine.<//Review>< response>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>The best Chinese restaurant ever from my experience. They are best at food and services. My husband and I ordered three dishes, the Gong Bao Chicken is so tasty! And the size of each portion is big, we only finished about half of each and took the leftovers home. Their service is super efficient, no more than five  minutes  after we set down, the food had already been brought to our table. The server speaks pretty good English and was super polite.

I would strongly support good Chinese restaurants as the catering market  in USA is so unfair to Chinese restaurants. They work very hard, most of them are far more polite than severs in American or Italian restaurants.<//text>< name>

Food is great. We went many times here and tried many dishes and every thing turned out tasty. The tablet to choose selections is cool.

Quite crowded so wait time is often long. Parking close by is hard. Had trouble in communicating with waitress in English.</Review>

<text>Said to be the best Chinese restaurant in Fremont by everyone and indeed it is.

Food is impeccable, authentic mordant Chinese dishes. What’s making the difference is also the ambiance, specialty Chinese drinks and continent ordering system - really make you feel like you are in a trendy restaurant in Shanghai.

Two thumbs up!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Food is okay, but one of our dishes is too salty. After letting the owner knows, he suggested to offer us a recooked one, but I am a little bit concerned, so I refused. And then he offered us a free dessert - the Glutinous Rice Balls in Fermented Glutinous Rice, which is really good, and we love it. Due to this, I would give the owner a 5 start in services. Thank you, and I think I will come back again for your service, and give your dishes another try.< /text>

Pretty good nouveau Chinese.  Dry fried string beans were very good.  The pork belly is presented beautifully though a bit over cooked.  The pork liver was zesty though a bit oily.  Maupa Tofu was flavorful.< /text>

< review>
We’ve been coming here many, many times, usually as a group of 6 to 8 people.  The second Chinese character in the restaurant’s name means Hunan.  Hunan region is famous for their spicy and heavily flavored food.  You can find some dishes that are not spicy but then you’d miss the main reason the customers come to eat here.  Service is always quick and attentive.  Food, well, is very spicy, even if you ask them for not-so-spicy for the dish.  The price is very reasonable.  This is my place to go for spicy Hunan food.  This time, we arrived at 5:45 on a Sunday evening and were able to get a table right away.  By the time we were done, 7:20 PM, it was crowded with around 20 to 30 people outside waiting to be seated.<//review>

<review>This place has incredibly fast service. The food is served good but is extremely spicy. So if you dont like spicy food, this place isn't for you. But if you are a spicy food lover, this place is amazing. The only bad thing is th hat the food portions are kinda small. But overall great experience.</review>< resp>

Mighty Yummy Spicy Chinese/Hunan food.   NOT  for the weak of tongue.   If you do not like spicy food, there are plenty of bland Chinese food places elsewhere to try.  If you like to spice life up this place is heaven.   A little spendy by Chinese food standards, but well worth it.  Loved  the cold noodle appetizer.
Service was surprisingly fast, and the tablet-based menu/ordering system very efficient.</Review>

<review>They were open for Christmas night.

Family ordered their share of food, and I ordered the baked shrimps and sizzling beef.

Beef itself was tender and had a good ratio of onions to beef; very easy mistake to put too much onions, making it look like a veggie dish with meat garnishing it.

Baked shrimps laid on a bed of enoki mushroom and had a teaspoon of minced garlic on top; delicious, presentation was good, but for it's price lacking in portion size. Basically about 2 shrimp per person for a family of 6.

Overall, the food is solid and delicious, decor isn't bad although a bit stuffy, prices are slightly higher than most Chinese places.</review>< pics>

< review>
Very nice restaurant selling Hunan food. Most dishes are spice and flavorful so do expect to eat a lot of rice here. Very decent decoration and service is great. They refill our water and napkins without we even asked. I really like how they setup the food in the plate as well. Most dishes are around $12 to $20+ and portion is fair.</review>

<text>Probably one of few places around the area where you can get authentic Chinese cuisine.   It's a bit pricey, but it's by far better than other restaurants around the area. I hope you can handle spicy.</text><Gmap_id>0x808fbe2ea5fe3fd7:0xe38c0f8ff4e3e1a7<//Gmap_id><Name>Billy<//Name><Rate>5< /Rate>< Response>

< Review>
It was our first time to Ping's Bistro.
Service & ambience, I give it 4 Stars.
Food, I give it 2.5 Stars.
Wait Time, I give it 2.5 Stars.
Prices, 2.5 Stars ($75 for 3pp).
We came based on the reviews & for the Steamed Fish Filet w/Peppers (similar to Dual Fish we liked at Shao Mountain restaurant that closed).  The waiting area in front only had room to seat 4pp & was pretty cramp for the 3 of us standing along w/2 others.  We arrived at 8pm on a Sat night & our table for 3pp got seated in 30mins.  The seats at our table were comfortable but the spot light above was a bit too glaring.  Service was ok.  Our food came pretty fast & portions were big.  Our $12 large milktea was big enough for the 3 of us to split & have 1.5 cups each.  Unfortunately, the milktea was the only item we really liked.  The Shredded Chicken Noodle w/Cucumbers was not spicy nor flavorful enough.  The Chairman Mao's Braised Pork Belly was ok, but not tender enough.  We were really disappointed with the Steamed Fish Filet w/Peppers;  It was extremely salty & not spicy enough also.  We tried to scrape off the green & red peppers sauce on top to see if it would be better but it was still too salty to eat.  I brought the leftovers home & my boyfriend tried the Chairman Mao's Braised Pork Belly & said it sucked because it wasn't tender & kind of dry.
We probably won't be back.</Review>

Opening hrs is misleading. It said open till 10pm.
When I arrived at 9:15pm, they refuse to serve us and said the kitchen is already closed.

The attitude is really bad.</text>

Food is authentic. Very busy pace, super long wait time if you don’t have reservation. If they tell you wait time is 30mins, usually it takes 1.5h... service quality gets bad when they are too busy.< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is really good to eat on the way back from Sanfan, but if you bring foreign friends to remember to be less spicy, the taste is too authentic and they can't stand it.

(Original)
从三番回来的路上顺道一吃，真心不错，不过要是带外国朋友来记得要少辣，味道太正宗他们受不了。</Review>

(Translated by Google) It's spicy and comfortable. The fried rice disappeared half as soon as it was served.

辣的好啊,舒服。炒饭刚上桌就不见了一半，味道好积了，够锅气。</Text>

(Translated by Google) The taste is New China, no odor, delicious! The taste of Mapo Tofu is better for using Korean stone pot again!

(Translated by Google) At the time of the 11th, I arrived at the restaurant, but in fifteen minutes, someone started to wait. I ordered three dishes and one dessert tasted very delicious! ! The picky thing is that this dish will be slightly biased, and it is very suitable to send meals. Grilled fish has a little bit of astringency.

(Original)
11点出头的时候到的餐馆不过十五分钟就有人开始需要等位了。点了三个菜一个甜品味道都非常好吃！！挑剔一点的就是这家菜品都会稍稍偏重口，拿来送饭是很合适的。烤鱼有小小一点腥味。</Text>

(Translated by Google) The best grilled fish in the United States. Milk tea is also very tasty. The dried cabbage wraps actually burned the domestic taste. If you don’t say it, you want to eat it again.

在美国吃到的最好的烤鱼。奶茶也是非常好喝。干锅包菜竟然烧出了国内的味道。不说了，，又想去吃了、</text>

(Translated by Google) The small fried yellow beef Juxiang is delicious, but it is especially spicy. Remember to make it spicy! Finally, the clerk gave us a dessert to see that we were too spicy, and the service attitude was super good ✌️

小炒黄牛肉巨香巨好吃，但是特别辣，记得要小辣！最后店员小哥看我们太辣就送了一个甜品，服务态度超好✌️</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Five stars praise! ! We waited for an hour for the first time, and when we got the dishes, we felt that it was worth it! The service attitude is very good, because our personal taste is relatively weak. The fried dish is salty. The weight of the dish is also very good! ! Eat fast and find that one of our soups is sold out. Because of the sale, I also sent a dessert. Very caring and polite! ! Worth a try

(Original)
五星好评！！我们第一次来排队排了一个小时，吃到菜品的时候觉得等的值得！服务态度非常的好，因为我们个人口味比较偏淡。炒出来的菜偏咸 二话不说帮我们重新炒！菜的分量也非常足！！快吃饱发现我们点的一个羹汤卖光了。因为卖光了还送了份甜品。非常的贴心有礼貌！！值得一试< /Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I have a few restaurants in the heart of the Bay Area. Basically not very trampled, recommended pork belly poached eggs, idyllic green vegetables, flat pot squid, brown sugar, home cooking such as sour bean meat, glutinous rice, radish and fried bacon are also very delicious. Wall cracking recommendation😋

(Original)
我心中湾区前几名的餐厅。基本不怎么踩雷，推荐 猪肚荷包蛋，田园青菜钵，平锅鱿鱼须，红糖糍粑，家常菜如酸豆角肉沫，藕夹，萝卜干炒腊肉也都是很好吃的。墙裂推荐😋</text>

(Translated by Google) It is delicious, but the portion and spiciness are not as good as they were at the beginning. A common problem in the Chinese catering industry is anticlimactic, and each year is worse than each year. The dishes are very spicy, especially the boiled dishes. It is not spicy like that of Sichuan, it is really spicy. I feel that most Cantonese cannot eat this spicy dish. It is emphasized that people who are not particularly fond of spiciness are advised not to challenge the spicy dishes of this restaurant!

好吃，但份量和辣度不如剛開始那樣。中餐饮业界的通病，虎頭蛇尾，一年不如一年。菜很辣，特別是水煮系列的菜都辣。它不是四川那种麻辣，是真辣，感覺大部分的广東人吃不了这家的辣菜。強調建议不是特別喜歡辣味的人，不要挑戰這家的辣菜！<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Sichuan cuisine is better than the famous Yuxiangyuan. The bullfrog and Mapo tofu boiled fish are authentic. No spicy people, recommended food

川菜的特色好过有名的御香园，牛蛙还有麻婆豆腐水煮鱼都很地道。无辣不欢的人，推荐吃处</text>
