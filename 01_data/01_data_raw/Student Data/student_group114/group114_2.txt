<Rating>1< /Rating><text>The business does not value its members. I was over charged, then was promised a refund. Never received that, only FIVE additional charges. When I went in to talk to them it was like dealing with a used car salesman. Was told if I canceled my membership I would receive NO credit or refund for anything, including the future charges!   Although they would work with me if I continued my membership. Total manipulation and extortion!  Too many friends have had similar experiences!  STAY AWAY. Many other good, reputable gyms in town!< /text>< Pictures>

<Time>1605482072999< /Time><Rating>3</Rating><review>I love working out there. They have tons of equipment. They have both lots of weights and lots of cardio equipment. I also love that the space is large. The employees are fairly nice. They have a smoothie/juice bar, however it is rarely open when I’m there. I go in the mornings around 7 am. When I have been there on a weekend and it was open I did try the smoothies. They were good just very expensive. A small smoothie for $6.00. The reason I only give City Sports a 3 star review is they lack in cleanliness. The locker rooms are terrible. They can’t seem to keep a janitor. My guess is they don’t pay enough for the workload. They have a dry sauna in each locker room, a shared jacuzzi and pool. Many people don’t even bother using the locker rooms because they are so bad.<//review>< Pictures>

Got a day pass to check out gym and was mortified.  First, the woman with the mermaid looking silver blonde hair was INCREDIBLY rude.  But that wasn't the worst of it... the machines were dirty. The pool room had so much chlorine it was hard to breath. The bathrooms were so gross I refused to be barefoot.  I opened a locker and found mouse droppings🤢🤮. But wait it gets worse - the showers walls were riddled with mold and mildew... in every stall! I left without taking a shower 😡. Truly a horrible and disgusting experience</review>

<review>Great classes, many veriety of ways to work out and a wonderful swimming pool,  hot tub and sauna. Everything is kept clean but unfortunately things do not get repaired in a timely manner. I have reported something that needs to be fixed for the past 3 weeks now but still has not happened. Water has been cold in showers for a 5 days now. Much too long!</review>< pictures>

Hello. I worked here at City Sports Club as the Janitor and I would have to say it was one of my more enjoyable jobs. Always something to clean and to do. :) The management here is spectacular, Tyler is really sweet and I truly enjoyed him as my manager. One of my favorite managers I've ever had! Also, there's tons of workout equipment here. It's a very enjoyable place to be at with many awesome people. Love all the teachers and the swimming pool too. People are usually very nice and will offer half their lane for you to swim in if it's too crowded. Great atmosphere and a top spot gym. Highly recommend it. :)<//text>

<review>Gym is disgusting.   The hot tub turned green and it's broken constantly.  The equipment is dirty.  The workout mats stink and are full of sweat and never get cleaned.  The management is non existent.   Worse of all the locker rooms don't get mopped , garbage always full, toilets have feces that hasn't been cleaned for weeks.  No paper towels and garbage on the floors and showers.  Sometimes one of the showers backs up and smells like fish.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x8085b47299d768e3:0x4c93e34acd23452f</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you're interested in personal training, I  recommend asking for Gina. She's very friendly and can work with you on any level. Ask her a question on anything related to fitness and I’m sure she can answer it!

<Text>I’ve got a series on Yelp explaining it all from the beginning. This is what occurred when I got lied to and stonewalled by some low level manager with a massive power complex. Here’s what I posted on Yelp:

This place has the absolute worst customer service- specifically from Tyler G. - some tiny little prick with a massive power trip who literally refused repeatedly to give me the name and number of his superior. Guess what? Apparently he doesn’t have one so if you have a customer service complaint, he won’t do ANYTHING to make the situation right ***because he doesn’t have to****. What is a customer supposed to do with being absolutely stonewalled like that?!?! He said to me repeatedly that while he does have a district manager (I had to ask at least 10 times before he’d even admit that he wasn’t THE guy running the entire company) she doesn’t have a phone?!?! A DM without a phone? Unheard of! Then guess what? I keep pushing so he finally admits that there IS a number for her but he doesn’t want to call and keeps pointing at his monitor saying, “see? She’s not online!” Finally he supposedly calls her (who knows?) and says she didn’t answer. I got him to give me her email address (funny how none of this was offered the first time I asked to escalate over him) so I’ll be following up with her and I’ll keep going up the chain until I speak to someone who doesn’t appreciate their customer service manager not only not doing right by the customer but also being the cause for these two members to quit this gym.two memCity Sports as a company should be ashamed and embarrassed!<//Text>< pics>

Good gym.  Nice people. Great equipment. Clean. Go in off peak times and it is all yours! I've been a member of many clubs in many cities. Would be nice to have an indoor track. But, N. Bay area clubs don't. All clubs including in San Diego have indoor tracks.  Great for heat waves and cold rainy days plus better on the knees & joints . But, none in Marin or Sonoma. City Sports is a good little gym. It has a nice indoor pool too.<//text>

Free weights and most of the gym equipment is pretty good however personal trainers are not very reliable weighted belts for dips and other push and pull exercises would be great and staff are fairly good as they haven’t been a disruption at the gym yet<//review>

Pros: Great staff, clean, inexpensive, a good variety of free weights and machines, sauna, lap pool, and hot tub. Cons: No towel service and few classes. Overall: Can't be beat for the price, but definitely not a fancy gym.< /Review>

<Review>We left City Sports for a lot of reasons.  The mold in the locker rooms and pool area was excessive and never seemed to be important enough for management to care for, ants were frequently crawling all over the mats, and customer service was almost non-existent .

We finally decided to quit and get a membership at another gym.  We closed our account and moved on with life.  Turns out they just froze our account, but told me it was closed.  They continued to take money from our checking account and when I called them about it, the Operations Manager, Tyler accused me of lying and informed me I was wrong.  He offered no help in fixing the situation and I had to spend the next 45 minutes on the phone with the corporate office to get anyone to listen to me.

Overall, I am pretty disappointed with my experience.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>First of all, @Andrew, this is a freaking GYM, not a sports bar. If you come to the gym to watch TV, then you're doing something wrong. Not to mention there are little TVs attached to every treadmill, bike and elliptical on the second floor with a wide array of channels. Reported.

@Brenden, do not post a review of a place you haven't been to because of something someone else told you. That's unfair and biased. Why don't you just ask her to write a review? Reported.

Okay, onto my actual review...

I saw the legitimate negative reviews, and from what it looks like, management took notice and did something about the cleanliness issues. In my six months here, I haven't noticed any mold in the pool area or the locker room. Overall the place is pretty clean.

The staff is friendly. In my experience they've been patient and helpful.

There are many options here for a good workout. A small-ish (3 lane) pool, an entire floor of cardio machines, tons of free weights, an entire room of spin bikes, a basketball court, plenty of resistance machines... if you're looking to change up your work out every day of the week, you could definitely do so here.

I pay $50/month for my membership that includes a free guest pass every time I come in, which I think is pretty reasonable! And they include a free session with a personal trainer, but that's pretty standard it seems. I've paid a lot more for a lot less at other gyms.

This is the best gym I've ever joined, hands-down. I like it here, and if you're looking for a a gym to join, I highly recommend their free trial, which is what sold me.< /Text>< Pictures>

In Petaluma they have stopped showing local Giants or Warriors games. Don't know if it's because Comcast Sports won't provide the shows or what. Can't get a straight answer from them. Will probably change clubs if they don't straighten this out.<//text>

< Review>
If you have to rent a storage unit and currently canvassing google looking for the best place/price/value... you can stop right now!  Your "stuff" will find a nice "home" here!    I've rented several units over my lifetime... and for the most part... way too long... but that's comedic tragedy!  : )    This location (18 Hughes) is very clean... it's surrounded mostly by businesses... very quiet... seems very safe... never had an issue in  nearly 10 years!    And of course... like any other place... prices will go up every year.    Now... what makes this place  an excellent experience... is the General Manager... Ghizala!   She has always been super friendly... ready to answer my questions and did a great job of calling me when my credit card had expired to keep me from incurring late charges.    She is SUPER!      Good Luck with your decision and I am confident that you will have the same experience I did!  Yes... I finally emptied my storage unit in October 2019.<//Review>

G was such a delight to work with. We had a very unique situation that Requires an out-of-the-box thinking and G jumped right in and got the situation handled with no delay to us or the movers.  This is a great location where staff treat you like family!<//Text>

<Name>K L Wu<//Name><Review>Hands down one of the best customer service experiences I've had in many many years.  Ghizala is a sweet manager and does everything she can to make sure you have a good experience.

Lewis, her other manager was extremely professional and cordial when I laoded him up with questions regarding monthly rent fees and how they are applied.

In this day and age where technology takes a front seat, being able to pick up the phone and get a live voice on the line us very rare.  And these two do it expertly.

If I miss them they call back right away.

Would definitely use them again should I ever need storage.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>If you have to rent a storage unit and currently canvassing google looking for the best place/price/value... you can stop right now!  Your "stuff" will find a nice "home" here!    I've rented several units over my lifetime... and for the most part... way too long... but that's comedic tragedy!  : )    This location (18 Hughes) is very clean... it's surrounded mostly by businesses... very quiet... seems very safe... never had an issue in  nearly 10 years!    And of course... like any other place... prices will go up every year.    Now... what makes this place  an excellent experience... is the General Manager... Ghizala!   She has always been super friendly... ready to answer my questions and did a great job of calling me when my credit card had expired to keep me from incurring late charges.    She is SUPER!      Good Luck with your decision and I am confident that you will have the same experience I did!  Yes... I finally emptied my storage unit in October 2019.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5fzqtR1Wg_YxCx4oF84b0EDHbTkQx29PWi8Kf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I have been here for a long time and have had nothing but good service. Ghizala, I think that’s how you spell her name, is the best.</Text>

I don't know who this place may have hired to give them good ratings, but don't believe it for a minute. I can't believe that I even considered renting a storage space here. Rude!  And the lies that were told to me, not once but three times is ridiculous! I referred my son to this place and when I did instead of saying Thank You, they said "oh we can't give a good rate anymore, only you OR your son! My son is a grown man who hasn't lived with me for 20 years and they say that we're in the same family so we can't get any specials. Are you serious? I verified three times that my son and I were getting the same price. It was even in writing. But deceit and lies is all I received from this rude guy, Kyle and his female manager who he seemed to be terrified of.  I can see why she doesn't wear a name tag. I guess she thinks that no one can identify her that way. Good luck with this place. I wouldn't go near it.< /text>

My experience is so far so good. Very accommodating, pleasant, understanding staff. Let me share a short story to put it in perspective;

I was working late one evening, nothing on that day was going right. I was beat, didn’t get a chance to eat a single bite and the manager’s husband brought my mcdonalds.

Whoever is reading this, these types of good gestures are rare and people with good hearts are rare these days.</Text>

<Review>Perfect location! Very clean! So thankful to Ghizala, she was so patient, courteous and understanding! I like how she was assertive and was thinking for all the customers and to have a great storage for everyone. We forgot the bag with food from the fridge and she was very polite and at same time concerned for all the customers. We came and fixed the issue and I’m extremely grateful to Ghizala for her patience and courtesy, and also for patiently explaining everything at the beginning of our contract. A+ service!!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

G always gives you a cold face as if you somehow owe her money from thousand years ago. I spent 40 mins doing the paperwork with her until the last minute when she requested me to buy the insurance from her or I cannot rent any unit! 40 mins wasted with terrible feeling, good trap and job G!< /text>

<Review>If I could give a negative star I would!  This G woman is impolite, unprofessional and DISHONEST.  She tried so hard to force me to purchase their storage insurance even after I informed her I already have it covered with my home insurance.  And she RUDELY told me that I must buy insurance from her or I can't rent the unit.  She didn't bother inform me that I indeed have the option to decline the insurance.  Guess what?  I did end up renting the unit at a different Public Storage location without being forced to purchase the storage insurance!! AS A MATTER OF FACT, ON THE CONFIRMATION SCREEN when you book it at the storage, THERE IS AN OPTION TO DECLINE THAT INSURANCE!!  For all the future potential customers: you do NOT have to buy the insurance from her if you already have it covered somewhere else.  She WILL trick you to buy it, be aware - she'd say it's required to maintain insurance to rent a unit, YES I can maintain insurance but it's my own insurance NOT the one you try to sell me, simple !!!
PLEASE G, DO NOT LIE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS, THAT IS THE LEAST YOU CAN DO!!</Review>< response>

< review>
it's a storage place in a nondescript area of Irvine,  industrial tech area and not located near any junkie encampments. this was my basis for choosing this location. for me this was needed as emergency evacuation of personal belongings from a residence due to a multitude of toxic contaminations occurring at once.

pro tip: if you can, wait for a sale. got lucky in that regard as the 50% off for the unit because of a labor day promotion was a very welcome discount.

the woman behind the counter, Ghizala was courteous and made the process quick and easy.</review>

My son Steven and I have had a storage unit at this property for more than 30 years.  The entire staff has always been very helpful.  Recently we visited the property to move into a larger storage space and Irma was not only helpful she went out or her way to make sure we were able to find a larger space that was very close to the smaller space we needed to upgrade.  This made the move-in to the larger space much easier<//review>

As far as any public storage goes this facility I've ever used.   By any measure one of the best I've ever dealt.  let's face it.   going to storage is not our favorite thing to don.  these guys make it as easy as they can.   I was well taken care of from reservation to renting the unit.   Everything was explained in detail.  I worked mostly with Ghizala but everyone I worked with there was very professional.  they have good terms & great prices.   Long hours too. more than a few times I've had to work with storage place that was only open during business hours in the weekdays.  How inconvenient is that?  Is guys are open  seven days a week including holidays and from early morning until late at night.< /Text>

I had a very good experience at this store.  The storage manager Ghizala was professional, very helpful, she stayed late after hours because I was there just at closing time.  She did not hesitate to show all the properties, explained in detail rate and policy of the store.  She was kind and understood customers need.  I will highly recommend to use this facility.<//review>

My mom recently rented out a unit and received excellent customer service from Irma. She was very helpful and friendly, explaining the contract and fees clearly and thoroughly. This storage facility is always so clean and well maintained. I've been renting a unit here for a few years and always find Ghizala to be very kind and friendly, so it was no surprise to me that Irma would extend the same high quality service to my mom. Thank you Irma, for making it a great experience!<//text>

When I finally cleaned out my old storage unit and put everything into a five by ten, Ghizala made the change easy for me by keeping the smaller unit available while I got rid of half my ball and chain.  Kept paperwork smooth and simple.  Good person.<//Text>

I have dealt with other moving and storage companies and this one was my best experience. Ghazaleh was particularly helpful with all of our needs.<//Text>

Customer service is EVERYTHING and the staff at this facility understand that. I have been with my current company for 5 years and have probably dealt with Ghizala two, maybe three times. When I walked in today to take care of some outstanding business, she recognized me right away and knew exactly who I was with. I can't tell you how important it is to make your customers feel like they matter. It's like they exist just for me. I would highly recommend giving your business to Public Storage at 18 Hughes in Irvine, CA. You won't be sorry!!< /Text>

I had a wonderful experience this time in the office and it was all due to Lauren, the representative behind the counter I entered the office and was met with a smiling face, great attitude and a willingness to assist me  in my visit. I was very impressed with her customer service, it was a great experience.< /review>

I rented a storage unit at this location yesterday. Immediately after reserving my unit, the property manager Ghizala called to follow up with me. From that moment on she provided one of the most pleasant experiences I've had the pleasure of enjoying. She was over the top helpful, professional, and very kind. Not to mention, she had the entire process completed quickly and efficiently. Thanks to Ghizala, I am a Public Storage lifer.</review>

<text>I have to say that from the first day I put my belongings into storage I was nothing but happy with the facility. Its clean, secure and the property manager Ghizala is so extremely helpful and friendly.
I recently closed my storage account because I moved into a house and no longer needed the extra storage space. The day that I moved was well over 100 degrees and I was so overheated. I went into the office to cool off and Ghizala was so understanding and kind. She offered me water and a place to sit.

I highly recommend this facility and if I ever need storage again this is where I will go.<//text><resp>None<//resp></record>

The current staff and Management at this facility, have always conducted themselves in a professional and friendly manner, in my dealings with them.

I recommend this facility without any reservations, if you are in the market for storage space either for your business or personal needs.< /Text>

Manager  Gazala from the day one has been very professional and helpful in making my storage experience better. She helped me made right decisions about storage and helped me save money as well.
Abdullah has also helped me many times and I wanted to thanks to both these folks.</Review>

<review>Ghizala was the very best! We have used Public Storage in the past and have always had positive experiences.
Ghizala is definitely an asset to your organization.

< Review>
I am very glad I chose to get my storage unit at this location. They had the very best customer service any customer could ask for when interacting with ANY type of business! & this was all because of the kindness and enthusiasm that the Property Manager Ghizala showed to me when I made my reservation!!
Not only did he suggest the right size unit for me, but she also called about 15min before closing when she saw I didn't show up yet to get my unit, just to make sure I didnt lose track of time (which n fact I did!!) I pleaded for her to wait for me to get there.before.closing or else id have no where to put my belongings since it was my last day at my apartment.. Not only did she patiently wait for me to arrive when I was 5min late after closing, but she didn't make me feel rushed in any way and still made sure we walk to see my unit 2 see if was big enough & made sure I could do the gate code properly! It was extremely refreshing to deal with someone that truly loves their job and gives 100% even after closing time!! Thanks Ghizala!<//Review>

<Name>Daughvin D<//Name><review>DO NOT COME HERE!
This place has changed so much over the last two years. Quality of food has downgraded immensely, and the service is by far worse. I just drove 30 min to get some chicken tacos I ordered ($11 for 5 tacos on taco tuesday btw) and when I get home I discover 5 carne asada. I leave them there for my girlfriend to eat and go back to get my chicken tacos I ordered in the first place. They refuse to serve them to me as I didn’t bring back the carne asada tacos, which would be against the law for them to reuse, and highly unsanitary to re eat during a pandemic. I asked them straight up. “You think I drove all the way back here to lie and get $10 worth of tacos from you?” To which the woman working the front replied “Yes” right in front of who seemed to be her manager about 10 feet away just watching. As someone who works in the food service industry at a restaurant, this is pathetic service, especially to a loyal customer who has been coming here since 2017. I will never return and I truly recommend nobody else does.< /review>< GmapID>

The meat tasted kinda funny and the chicken was kinda dark. The veggies were over cook and kinda chewy.  My girl got the menudo and it was decent. Can't complain about the menudo.

Jerry's food is always fresh and always delicious, we stop by when we are by the area of Downey, employees are super kind and serve you fast, place is clean plenty of parking, I had "Aguachile" on my visit and it was delicious and spicy just how I like it, plus they take their time decorating your plate not just tossing everything inside but well prepared!!< /review>

<Review>Tacos or burritos only. Everything else was overpriced and not exactly excellant quality. Really slow service and margarita had no tequila in it. I was very disappointed. But the folks at our table who ordered tacos and burritos had very good food.

Their food is amazing and they have the best tortas. The bread is buttery and not at all oily. The workers are very friendly and have always met my needs. Highly recommend and if you happen to stop by don’t forget to check out their little fish bowl of tips !!< /text>

Bottom line: THIS is the reason guys tried to escape from Alcatraz. Super burrito steak and pork awesome.Really really good.  Fast service, great chips too.  Worth the flight from MAP. Atmosphere is exactly what it is....no pretenses but who cares.My teenage son couldn't finish his...they are huge.</review>

Great family owned business. Large menu variety. Today had the 1/2 dozen oysters delicious and good presentation with great toppings not just plain. Also had the shrimp taco called gobnador (sp)? Also very good like all the items they serve. Highly recommended for a good Mexican meal. Never disappointed coming here to spend my money$$.< /Review>

If you wanna lose weight go eat at Jerry's tacos, it was a sauna in there. Michelada wasn't good , it wasn't even filled to the top when she brought it out. Also ran out of el pastor meat, slow service, horrible experience.< /text>

Dont let the pictures of the menu fool you. Low quality food, and the service was bad. The only good thing about Jerry's taco was the cold modelo. Michelada was light in color and watered down. Place has good potential and would have a better ambiance if then can upgrade food and service.</Text>

This is my go to taco shop. The hot sauce is freaking amazing and will make you gasping for water. Tacos are cheap, but super flavorful. Get the carnitas or the pastor.

Big fan. You gotta come to this place!<//review>

<review>The best tacos in town!! All of their food is delicious! I've been coming to eat here with my family since they opened a few years back. Back when it was just Jerry and his family running the restaurant. You get true home cooking here. If you haven't been here in a while, their menu has almost tripled in size! They have a full staff now and they serve beer! Try their michelada it's perfect on a hot day and tastes even better with their ceviche!< /review><rate>5</rate><user_name>Daniel Ortega<//user_name>< pictures>

<time>1552241345455</time><rating>5</rating><Text>We took a trip to Knotts Berry Farm but had no interest in amusement park food (funnel cakes excepted) I decided to google "Best tacos near me". Three topped the list but Jerry's Tacos caught my attention. Just 1.4 miles from Knotts, we walked to the place while my wife kept saying, "It better be good!"

Well, it was FANTASTIC. The authentic food,  the service and the atmosphere was superb! The portions huge, the prices very reasonable. The owners, Jerry in particular is very friendly and welcoming. His wife has to drag him socialize the entire time!

Try the 4 Taco plate, the Pozole  the Shrimp Burrito, or the Chile Rellenos. We came back for breakfast! A truly great find!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I searched for a taco place close by for my family to eat at after a long day at Knotts Berry Farm. This one had the highest ratings so we gave it a try, And it did not disappoint! Great family spot, 99cent tacos, $3 for all beers. What more could you ask for? I 100% recommend this place!< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Great flavor and the most authentic place around the area... Jerry's is family owned and operated, and they work their butts off to serve you the freshest, most tasty Mexican food. The salsa verde is awesome and the red salsa will set your mouth on fire =)<//Review><time>1427757865664< /time><Name>Ashley Mills</Name>< Pictures>

<Text>I have visited Jerry's on many occasions primarily because it is so near to my home. They have a decent menu and most of the items I have ordered were satisfactory but I've yet to try a real WOW item. They have a wide range of meal and drink options but unfortunately they do not offer aguas frescas. The ones they do have are from a "Bang" dispenser and that just does not fly with me.</Text>< Pics>

This used to be a good, although a little overpriced placed to eat but now..... no flavor in the rice and beans.  The carnitas and carne asada look like they were frozen or just microwaved (over cooked in the microwave) and plopped on the plate as an afterthought.<//text>< pics>

Great place, great quality food.
Just started business last year or so.

Needs more staffing.
And some standardization.

Besides that, i recommend it.< /review>

I just tried the asada burrito... Omg it was so good I wanted to order another one ,but I was full. If you want to eat good mexican food close by here, then I recommend you to go to Jerry's Tacos. 😊👍</Text>

<date>1433269380802</date><Review>I'll gladly pay you Tuesday, for a $.75 Jerry's taco today.

Huh?  Today's Tuesday?!?  SONOFA!!!!!!!!!

Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Taco!  Taco!  Taco!  Taco!

Yes, you heard right.  Taco Tuesday gets you one of Jerry's street tacos (asada, pastor, chorizo, pollo & carnitas) for the bargain basement price of $.75.  Unfortunately, cabeza, lengua, tripas & potato aren't included & are at regular price.  On the bright side, regular price is just $1.50.  And, to stick it to the other taco shops (I'm looking at you, Rubio's), Taco Tuesday at Jerry's is all day!  Tacos for breakfast, tacos for lunch, tacos for dinner.  It's your call.

I went with asada, pastor, chorizo & carnitas.  What a great value!  I can't recall spending a measly $.75 on something better, in recent memory.  The various meat were tender & juicy.  Of the four, my favorite would have to be the pastor.  It just had that great authentic pastor taste which I adore.  The others were good as well, especially the crunch of the carnitas.  Total including tax = $3.24.  Heck yeah!

A typical salsa bar offers up the usual suspects of green & red sauce, onions, limes/lemons, etc.  The pickled carrots were a little soft & lacked the firm crunch which I like.  Only a minor grievance, however.

Browsing the menu, I saw all the Mexican comfort foods covered.  Such as tortas, enchiladas & weekend specific items like menudo & huaraches. My interest was piqued with a carne asada plate that comes with grilled nopales (cactus), which I think I'll have the next time I come by.   As a welcome start to the morning, breakfast burritos are very affordable at $3.99.

Service was good.  The lady working the front was friendly & I didn't wait long before going to town on my taco plate.  A wooden décor consisted of tables & booths, providing ample seating.  A bamboo thatched roof over the booths gave a rustic hacienda feel to the dining area, with Mexican artwork proudly displayed on the walls.  2 flatscreen TV's for diner's viewing pleasure.

Parking is in a private lot at the Grand Central strip mall.  Jerry's Tacos is located on the right of Nonosina Polynesian Dance Studio.

As a wee laddie, I always rooted for Tom over Jerry in the cartoons, but with all day $.75 Taco Tuesdays at Jerry's Tacos & Mexican Restaurant,, I'm firmly behind Jerry.  For only a little scratch, you can get some major grub on.  Go get you some!

Highly recommend!

(Translated by Google) The food I love and the nice staff I accept because
There are 2 cashiers who look at you with an angry face and it is uncomfortable. It is time for lunch.

It was really a great experience. I taped on the hot bench show. they were on top of the Covid exposure considerations and were very hospitable plus quite professional. They are quite organized in all of the facets of they're soundstage facilities. Great parking it was fun.< /text>

Please, PLEASE, get rid of this LA Unscripted show. What the heck is this? It’s the most pointless show ever. I’ve recorded shows for our local high school channel that have been more interesting than this. Put two and a half men back!< /Review>

Fake fools especially the weekend people and very especially Mrs. Romero so happy-go-lucky while Mr. Burros is deceased from a drug overdose and totally especially the other news channels that reported the bad news but ktla didn't mention it at all. I must admit Romero did a decent job with the sobbing acting job she did the first Sat. she had the others had to fork out when they had to show up for "work".<//Text>

So I'm walking in this area yesterday on my way to an event in this vicinity and the traffic here is tremendously bad. The intersection near KTLA news is hectic because many drivers are out of control and don't know how to prevent dysfunction and how to react to bad driving.
If you are reading this and you are guilty of this please surrender and take a deep breath and inhale and exhale.< /review>

This is like a terrorist agency. They only report the most terrible news - shootings, fires, violence, etc. It’s like they want to perpetuate fear in the public. I never watch, but I hate when I happen upon the opening of the news and they’re presenting all this terrifying news.< /Review>

KTLA is a great source, but sadly, not for long. Sinclair will make KTLA from first to worst, by forcing them to be pro-Trump and antagonize the community. In 2004, protesters in Asheville resisted Sinclair, but now, it's 2017, and the problem is back, so L.A., it's time to resist Sinclair once again!</review>

<Text>Very disappointed with Sam Ruben in his interview with Samuel Jackson. To ruben, you're definitely not that removed or above knowing who Samuel Jackson is or the difference between him and Lawrence Fishburne. Thanks for showing the viewers who you really are.

I love watching your morning show, I watch it everyday.  Please know the story you ran earlier today about the 19year old boy who drove his car off P.V. cliff is that of our friend's son.  Please know that at the bottom of the page it states, "Share this with someone who would like this story", Listen that is so distastefull!  I can't imagine you would do that for any terrible or sad story.  Please be kind and courteous to stories like these, this is still someone's child.  ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS, not an object.<//Review>

Once again, Mark disappoints us! Waiting to here what the weather will be like in the OC and he passes us up. Had to change to channel 4. There are some of us that don't have all day to hear the weather. We count on hearing it. You should include the OC each time. :( !<//text>

Really?!  Sterling news conference is more important than Jerry Springer?  Who's smokin' crack over there?  Put Jerry back on!  Sterling ain't racist!  He looks like a SAINT next to the kooks in Jerry's house...

Jer-RY!  Jer-RY!  Jer-RY!

Jerry needs to be the official KTLA Correspondent for all current controversies  involving racism, infidelity, weed & HOs!</text>

TERRIBLE - no one picks up over there. let me vent on last night's sports broadcast. 98% of the reporting by horton was about how the mighty lakers have fallen and only in signing off The Clips get a shout, "you know what, congratulations to The Clippers". that's it. That was the sum total of The Clipper historic victory over the lakers. Is ktla in the tank for the lakers? It sure seems so. Look, there are plenty Clipper fans, who for years took the brunt of your jokes on The Clippers and now that the scripts are flipped all you talk about is the poor lakers? Really? Are you kidding me? C'mon man get it together over there and get behind the only basketball team in town right now - THE CLIPPERS!< /Text>

< Review>
Waited close to 25 minutes for 2 torras when there were only 1person ahead of me!!! The guy calling the number was rude and didn’t even face me he was giving me his back not giving me my food when it was ready ...I do gotta say say that food taste is ok but portions on the fries are ridiculous not coming back for food</Review>

Scheduling the appointment was easy although I had to wait four days  for an appointment. The dispatcher understand my needs and knew the job required two technicians. She made the cost very clear. Technicians arrived promptly, were extremely careful as they pulled my refrigerator out, and diagnosed the issue quickly. They explained the problem clearly then carefully and  rapidly repaired. They cleaned the area where they worked. I highly recommend these technicians.<//review>

The technician was very skilled, nice, polite and respectful of the space he was working. He wore booties and a mask to comply with the COVID regulations. Very impressed with the quality of service.</Text>

<review>I have called Nana Appliance's technician to diagnose and fix refrigerator. The technician couldn't find the real problem and instead performed very trivial cleaning and he informed me that that it will fix the problem. But instead he made it worse, now I'm not getting water from the refrigerator's tap and ice-maker stopped working. Due to COVID we are considerate of who is coming in to our home, so we don't touch the same things touched by outsiders without sanitizing. I realized about this issue later and tried to reach out to them. I have called them 10+ times, wrote email to their support 2-3 times but still no answer and no came to fix this problem. Reported the incidence to my credit card company too.

These guys are scamsters and don't care about their customers. Their customer service is pathetic and keeps saying that someone will come but no one replies or call backs. I will never recommend anyone Nana Appliance Repair for any refrigerator repair work.< /review>< pics>

Edmund is fantastic. I bought a condo with 8 to 10 year old high end appliances that needed some tune-ups.  He ordered parts for my Bosch refrigerator and installed. His approach was to diagnose and attempt to repair with least intervention and when —through deductive reasoning-that did not quite work promptly orders parts and fixed at no extra labor cost to me. My Bosch fridge is working great now.< /Review>

I had a terrible experience with Nana, you are much better off going with a local appliance repair company as Nana is more of a middleman.

They sent a technician to repair my fridge who incorrectly said nothing was wrong with it and left after a quick cleaning of the accumulated dust.  The fridge continued to remain broken so I called asking for a follow up appointment to find that Nana customer service is absolutely terrible.

I called maybe 15 times over a week, waiting on hold until it kicked me off.  When I did get in contact with someone, they said they would connect me with 'dispatch' where I would wait on the line for another hour before the line cut out.  I would call back again and for a supervisor, who they said would call me back, which never happened (3 times).

When I finally was able to get an appointment scheduled, the technician cancelled on me and I had to start the process all over again.  Here I am four weeks after the original appointment and my fridge is still broken with no follow up appointment in sight.  STAY AWAY FROM NANA!</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>This was possibly the worst costumer experience I’ve ever had. I called to schedule a repair for my refrigerator and told them what the problem was. We scheduled a time, which the repair person missed without any warning. We then rescheduled again, which the repair person again missed without any information. When I called to check why this was, they told me the repairer had a personal emergency and couldn’t make it today. We rescheduled. And then a couple hours later the repairman called me and told me he could be there in a couple hours, well outside of the window we had already missed. He then tried to schedule other random times despite me having told him I already had something up and to check with the company. Probably less surprising at this point but he missed this third one too. I called and just cancelled, I’ll be going with a different company.

Here’s the kicker: the day after I canceled they billed me $70 for a “diagnosis.” Considering no one had ever made it to my house I was confused what this diagnosis was, talking on the phone with them apparently they took what I said during the first conversation about the repair needed and wrote that down as a diagnosis and so were basically charging me for saying what I needed. It’s been three days and I still haven’t gotten a refund despite multiple calls.

I highly, highly recommend you avoid this company like the plague.</Text></record>

Could not have been better. I called on Friday, was accommodated on Saturday with on-time, courteous, knowledgeable service. Bryce was professional and talked me through what he was doing to solve the issue. I was given an estimate of the cost prior to the appointment, which was much less that expected and worth every penny. I would not hesitate to use their services again!<//review>

I believe Nana is not an actual service provider, but instead just a middle-man that connects home owners with service techs in the area.

Nana has been literally impossible to reach.  I've called 7 times over 5 days, maxing out the hold time on each call, and requesting call backs.  I have yet to receive a callback.  I've sent 3 emails to the support email address, and have received nothing more than automated reply messages acknowledging receipt of my email -- but no response to resolve my issues.

I've been satisfied with the service tech himself (not affiliated with Nana as far as I can tell); he's been mostly responsive, and was courteous + straightforward about the repairs needed.<//Text>< Rating>

Today a technician named Aziz came to our property for an scheduled service and communicated with me that our credit card was not on file, I told him I would add one right of way but instead of waiting 5 minutes for me to do so, he walked out and gave us the worst attitude I have ever been given by a vendor, He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional.

Such exceptional service from Benyam! Very conscientious employee and is very knowledgeable regarding repairs and has been quite timely with his arrival on all occasions. I also need to give him a 10 for being such a personable, kind gentleman. He took off his shoes and wore his mask at all times which was immensely appreciated. I'm not sure if I'm able to request him for any future appliance repairs but if it were possible I would certainly request his excellent service. Great employee all around. Nana is lucky to have him as we know it's not always this smooth. He was also informative on the next steps so we never had to worry about next steps. Benyam is a keeper!!!< /Text>

<Review>Total scam. Fraudulent billing, terrrible service, no accountability or follow through by company or technicians. Number is a call center and which you'll get zero help from. Technician was a joke. Completely unknowledgable and no-showed on the follow-up (on a 4-hour window). My issue was a refridgerator stopped cooling. I was quoted the a service fee of $90 for the fridge and an extra $45 for a dishwasher I asked to have looked at. On tech's initial visit, he said fridge needed new fan and would send quote on parts. Then he just looked at dishwasher, no quote, no approved work. After he left, I was suddnely billed $220 for the dishwasher. ?? Then I received the fridge quote for  $440. That's $660 total of which $220 was already charged to me w/o permission. Tech then spent 5 days ordering parts and finally no-showed on the follow-up to install. Their service window is a massive 4-hours. That's a long time for me to wait around, plus plenty of time for him to just give me a call, which he never did. So after the no-show, I called a different, local company of a true professional. New company immediately knew the problem and fixed it same day for $280. (It was not the fan, which was totally fine.) I have now called Nana's billing department several times, had the issue escalated, and never heard back. It's been over a week.  So these scammers were charging me $660 and would have botched the work, whereas an actual real company fixed the real problem for $280. Stay far away from these guys. They've clearly spent a lot of money on Google advertising and that's it.  My advice is to use Yelp or similar service of local business, and not Google, to find an actually real, local company. An expensive lesson to learn for me.</Review><userid>106932857631617148937</userid>< Time>

<time>1560402694039<//time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>This company charged me and did not diagnose anything. I also called the office over 10 time trying to reschedule. The technician always had an excuse took my managers credit card number and took off. I then had to call him and he said he would be back in 20 minutes. He did not return.

He then text me at 10:30pm the same day to apologize. I called him the next morning and he said he would bring someone with him because the parking is difficult. He did call me 3x at about 12pm to tell me hes there. However, he knows where the location is (he took the credit card number and went inside the building) but didnt bother to go in this time and used me not picking up the phone as reasoning not to come in.

I then called the office and let them know what happened. Was assured they would come back and they didnt. They did apologize but went ahead and charged me and did not even diagnose my issue. The tech even said he did not have time to diagnose my issue but then retracted it the following day after I told him not to charge me because he did not do his job...

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IN SF... I have lost $100 of dollars of food and so many, "Im sorrys" and reschedules with no replies. I cant believe the office could not do anything.

I hope the owner sees this. I am 100% unsatisfied customer and will never recommend NANA Appliance Repair unless they can make this right!

Another thing is this tech tried to reach out to me after the 4th with the  "Ill be there" however I lost faith in him because the mount of times he said he would be there and didnt show up or some BS excuse. I wanted another tech and supposedly they scheduled someone but did not. HORRIBLE!!!

<Review>I called on Monday morning from Canada to order flowers for our daughter who attends university in San Dimas.  Despite the fact that it was a few days before Mother's Day, the order was taken and in just a few hours, the flowers were delivered to my daughter.  Jerry (who I dealt with) was awesome...great customer service....helpful/thoughtful! The bouquet was beautiful.  I highly recommend O'Malley's for any floral in the San Dimas area.  Outstanding service and product quality!!  Thank you, Jerry!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

They truly have an eye for arrangements, which is why I always trust them to do their thing. Their team is friendly and extremely attentive, and call me immediately if there are any changes or suggestions regarding my online order. The delivery is quick and professional. I would recommend over and over again.</Text>< time>

Wow! I found O'Malley's years ago and I have ALWAYS had them deliver the most beautiful, fresh, professionally arranged flowers! I am a customer for life!
In the past, I have tried several other florists but never had consistent results. Since I started using O'Malley's they have proven time and time again that they are hands down the BEST florists in the area! Great Job!!!< /Text>

<Review>WOW WOW WOW! I called this morning and they delivered same day and did an AMAZING JOB. It's very hard finding a good florist from 3,500 miles away but they did an amazing job! Went above and beyond my expectations for my floral delivery. 10/10 I highly recommend!!!!  They are beautiful!</Review>< pics>

I tried Google and I looked for florists near my family. I am the sister from Florida 😊Some were closed. 1 had barely any flowers and O'Malley's,  they are family owned since 1987 and I felt since they were open I wanted to support them. I ordered online and the owner called me back saying that he didn't have the flowers I picked out that they went to the flower mart to get fresh flowers and to please  trust him that he would do a better job than what I picked out.  He was so sincere and I know it's hard right now so my instinct was let's support them. He was honest and up front so let me go ahead and try. He said I wouldn't regret it. He promised🤞🏼They were so careful they wanted everything  perfect so they called to make sure someone was home and needed the gate code. I thought it was so wonderful they were trying so hard to make it great. I am so ecstatic 😁 the flowers were breath taking! I am so honored and glad that they were pushing forward with their business during this difficult time.  I  will ALWAYS use O'Malley's for all my floral needs. We all need to support our fellow businesses and let it be know when an above and beyond job was done! Thank you so much! Keep moving forward! Sincerely,  Sharon< /Text>

The young lady actually wanted my business who I met when walked through the door. Anyways, I needed help of an arrangement for an employee that was retiring after 25 years. I gave the staff my budget of $100 and they handled the rest. Picked up the arrangement 4 hours later and brought back to work. My employee was so impressed not to mentioned surprised. Thanks O'Malley's for being so kind and showing that you want my business. I'm certain I will be back to.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c32f3d9667666b:0xf497547c7d6f96f4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

These wonderful people are exquisitely gifted, creative, compassionate, responsive, and professional.  I ordered a "Special  Choice" bouquet for my sister, whose dog just passed away, to comfort her heart.  The staff crafted a beautiful, peaceful, and encouraging bouquet that was so unique and full of delightful, peaceful beauty!</review>

The biggest plus is, they last forever. They're not like your typical super market bouquet that dies 2 days later.  Very nice family owned business and very picky with their products and results.  They deliver and do large events. Ask for Coach Jerry.<//Review><UserId.>118198330084622875545</UserId.><Resp>None</Resp><date>1600488161387</date></record>

< Review>
My Sister from Florida found them on line, she spoke to the owner immediately and she said he was very caring and professional. She wanted to make my Girlfriend’s birthday even more special by ordering flowers.
When the flowers arrived, they were gorgeous❗️Not only the quality of the flowers were of high grade, but there was a lot of pride, professionalism and a touch of Luv put into making them.
My Sister said she had found a Florist in California that she Luved and will continue to do business with O’Malley Florist in San Dimas❗️<//Review>

<user>103213678984075631197<//user><review>I just put in an order from Florida and was so impressed with service that Jerry provided me. Originally, I planned to order online but had a question about the item. I decided to call the shop and Jerry answered. He was so knowledgeable and friendly. He helped me through the entire order. When I began to give him the recipients name he automatically knew who I was talking about, which just goes to show how much he cares about his customers. If I’m ever looking to order flowers in San Dimas again, I know have a florist shop to call.<//review>< gmap_id>

I can't praise O'Malley's enough on what a wonderful job they did on a floral arrangement I ordered for a memorial service. Jerry put together a beautiful arrangement of long-stem white roses that were perfect for this service. I live out of state and was a bit nervous about the flowers I had ordered. Jerry sent me a photo of the arrangement and also took the time out of his very busy morning to reassure me that the arrangement would be perfect . . . and they were.</Text>

< Review>
You know that saying 1st impressions are everything?? Well its true!!! My 1st order I placed was online in September 2013 and I thought it was pretty online but when my best friend received the arrangement - she stated it was the most Beautiful arrangement she has EVER received!!! Jerry out did himself!!!

So Tuesday 12/2/13  I placed the same order online as September to be delivered on Friday since my BF loved it before.. But last min - I found out my best friend wasn't working on Friday so i had to quickly change the order.. I called the shop and spoke with Jerry  - FUNNY Guy too :)~

(Little Back Story - Its been a year since my best friend & I have been to Hawaii and I wanted to send a little something to celebrate that week)  SO I asked Jerry if he was able to give me something Hawaiian looking and once again Jerry out did himself.
He made a Gorgeous arrangement and had it delivered 1 day earlier AND by 10:30am!!

My Best Friends Response "You Totally Blew Me Away! Your Selection is Perfect!!"

NO Jerry's Selection was perfect & he saved me!!!

I Highly recommend O'Malley's Flowers to everyone in & around San Dimas!!!

Thank You Jerry - Once again - You Rock!!!<//Review>

Very satisfied bride!! Matty and his team made our special day so beautiful. His attention to detail and impeccable taste creates incredible arrangements. He really focused on the style I was going for in decor and my dress and took my dream to the next level. So happy O'Malley's Flowers of San Dimas was part of our wedding and am looking forward to working with them again.< /text>

My mother asked me to handle ordering flowers for her at the last minute. This was no simple request as the flowers were needed on the west coast for a funeral service at 10 am the next morning and it was already 5 pm on the west coast.  In addition, my mother had very specific ideas of what she did and did not want and she is picky! I searched for florists in San Dimas and saw that O'Malley's flowers had good reviews so I contacted O'Malley's. Jerry was wonderful to work with. He spent a lot of time with me. He was extremely accommodating of my mother's requests and created a gorgeous arrangement.  Not only that, but the flowers were delivered shortly after 9:00am.  If you need flowers Jerry and his staff will not disappoint! I am thrilled that I found them.

<review>Went to O'Malley's for my Bridal Bouquet, Groom Boutonniere and boutonniere's for the grandmothers and mothers. They were absolutely stunning! My bridal bouquet was more than I could have ever dreamed of. It was bright and full and just absolutely gorgeous. Not only did I have a great experience while ordering, prices were reasonable and everything was ready on time. Would use O'Malley's again and again!<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1509468911493, 'text': 'Thank you so much for letting us know Kalyn, so happy your day went as well as you had planned.

<Review>O'Malley's Flowers managed by Jerry is an outstanding place for you to business with.

I had a lot of trouble in trying to buy flowers for a friend in San Dimas with my Visa card here from Australia.

Jerry had the patience and courtesy to help me with getting the task fulfilled after almost 2 weeks of trying.
Well done mate.

I am highly recommending that you use this business in the future.

The flower arrangements delivered on Friday were exceptionally put together and beautiful as the picture I received showed.

Pity the person receiving the flowers  has yet to thank me for them.</Review>< GmapID>

This is one flower shop I can guarantee to you is honest and really good.  I spoke to them on the phone from Northern California and the gentleman that answered my questions and took my order did everything he promised to the T!  I wanted to change the colors of the flowers from what was on the website - he promised to change the flowers to Blue and White without knowing that I would fly for the memorial and YES they indeed were blue and white and so nicely done!  Thank you O'Malleys.<//Review>

O’Malley’s is the most helpful, friendliest, and great priced florist that I have ever delt with!  They saved me when I was in a bind to get flowers for my daughters high school senior day waterpolo game, last minute!  They made the exception and made me 9 beautiful flower bouquets in under an hour, just in time for the presentation!  Thank you O’Malleys!!!!<//text>

<review>Since I moved from the east coast 3 yrs ago, have been looking for someone who understands how eye brows threading works. Roya did, after 7 different places, many trials.. By all means Roya is the best, whereever she goes, will follow her. THE BEST!<//review>< rate>

I cant stop talking about Roya I LOVE HER!!! Shes fast, efficient, and affordable what more can you ask for?!?!?  I have been getting my brows done by her for a couple of years now, she listens to what you want never rushes you and she’s extremely kind and approachable. You have to give her a try, Roya is a natural talent. You will never regret trying her.
Love you ROYA

<Text>Roya is very good at what she does, if
You mess You eyebrows up with plucking, Roya will reshape them back to life. Clean, honest and a hard working mother! Highly recommend for the Reseda, Northridge residents!<//Text>< rating>

In general though, I want to point out that my experiences the last 6 years as a tenant in my home have been pretty terrible. I've had to call in innumerable repairs on the property. I can't seem to go 6 months without something going wrong, and the repairs have mostly been completed either as minimally as possible, only addressing the damage from an actual problem or completed poorly. I've been blown off and dismissed by in house technicians, only to have the exact issue I called about continue until an affiliate (outside or real contractor) comes and addresses the issue, backing up my report. I now request that only affiliates come for my maintenance issues. It's been a nightmare. I've had the hot water heater blow, flooding the garage, almost every window in the home and the sliding back door leaking water into the house with the back door causing the living room to nearly flood. They actually sent a plumber! I've had interior and exterior wall damage from those leaks, a broken drain pipe under the house and the upstairs toilet that had the wrong wax ring installed and leaked into the ceiling. All they did was scrape off the Bubbling paint and crumbling stucco and repaint/stucco. Once drywall gets wet, it needs to be replaced. It took about 4 years before they finally replaced the drywall and only because I called them out a second time for lots of bubbling paint and more crumbling stucco. I had a kitchen cabinet for fall off and hit me on the head, the bathtub spigot shot off and hit me in the shin, the shower valve broke and was streaming hot water when it was turned off, not leaking, streaming. The repair guys didn't replace it properly, and it would only do 1/4 turn. I had my own plumber fix it. When I moved in, the shower slider didn't have a good installed for the doors so the slid but also swung. They would fall off into the tub, and my roommate at the time and I had our kids in the house. Extremely unsafe. And don't get me started on the fact that I've had them out 4 times in the 6 years just to treat termites. If it had been treated properly the first time, I wouldn't have had to have 3 more treatments on the home. I now have damage to some of my personal property. They've already replaced a large portion of the fence around the backyard for termite damage and a good section of the fascia. It was so damaged that it left large gaping holes that air blew through. I noticed when it was blowing into my bedroom in winter through the gaps around my bedroom window at the sill. I got pretty sick that winter. I couldn't heat my room enough and my electric bill was huge because it took a few weeks for them to get the jobs completed to seal up my bedroom again. There are even more issues I haven't named. There's also damage from the repairs/ work done. There are still holes from termite spot treatments inside the home, the kitchen sink has a nice scrape/ gouge from the tech who replaced the leaky faucet, there are dents/ scratches inside and out from other techs as well, and personal peppery damage by repairmen. I just hope they don't try to pin those damages on me when I move. I've documented everything I've been through, everything I've fixed myself and all of my personal property damage.
Future renters beware. Invitation Homes may have some wonderful people on the phone, but at the end of the day they don't make the decisions that put renters like myself in these situations. That's management decision making.</review>

<Review>I’ve been with Invitation Homes for about 5 years now. We have a great 5 bedroom home on a nice quiet street. When we have maintenance issues Invitation Homes is quick to respond to assess the problem and correct it. And, I’ve had the greatest customer service experience with Jessica Vaca. She is the most professional, courteous helpful person I’ve come across in quite some time. With all that’s going on right now with this pandemic and everything else, it’s truly refreshing to come across someone that makes you feel better when you get off the call than when it began. I just feel that’s not something that’s taught, it’s truly who she is.< /Review>< Pics>

We rented from Invitation Homes for almost two years and had a great experience with everyone from the leasing office to the maintenance team. Michael Raspa is fantastic to work with - he was responsive each time I reached out over the years and he tried his best to make sure all of my questions were answered. The maintenance people that would stop by from time to time we’re always very professional and knowledgeable. I always got the feeling that they were genuine in trying to fix whatever I needed help with.
We moved out of our Invitation Home last month and the move out process was just as easy as the move in. Michael made sure we knew what options we had and they were all very pleasant to work with. The move-out inspector was very helpful in helping me identify how to get as much of my deposit back as possible. Overall, very very pleased to have rented from them.< /Text>

I gave them 4 stars because regardless of a global pandemic Invitation Homes still decided to raise the rent 😒(not cool). However besides that we have always had a good experience.  Our maintenance technician Joasa Hunkin is great! He has come out for maintenance on 2 separate occasions  and has always been professional. He does quality work and he is a cool dude.< /text>

I am very happy to rent from Invitation Homes -- they have treated me well for years;  they have a nice portal that allows payment by debit card which is great, and their maintenance portal is super responsive too.  I really love my house, thank you Invitation!  Special thanks to Michael Raspa who makes it all possible for me!!< /Review>

<text>This places embodies everything that is wrong with the world.  Poor response time.  Terrible communication.  Absolutely no care for the tenants.  Raising rent during a pandemic when property values in the immediate neighborhood are going down.  Don't go month to month at the end of your lease and make sure you give 60 DAYS notice!  They'll email you about the renewal rate around day number 61.  I would rather live on the streets than ever give another penny to this corporate slumlord.  And our representative Michael Raspa is no better himself, rude and inconsiderate.  He fits right in with this company's culture.< /text>< Rating>

This company is amazing. Alvin our realtor helped us out every step of the way and kept us updated all through the process of renting our first home. Unfortunately due to everything going on with Covid-19 we weren’t able to go through the process of actually moving in because we lost our jobs and couldn’t afford it any longer. The company and Alvin were so understanding and refunded our full deposit with out any issue. We really hope everything can go back to normal and would love to proceed with trying again with them.<//review>

If I could give no stars I would. If you have to rent from this company I would highly suggest doing a month to month contract. I guarantee that within the 1st month you will encounter an issue with the property or the bill that will require you to contact the property manager and you will not be able to get a hold of anyone. It is evident that customer service is not this company's priority, they only care about making money. The issue as I saw it while I was a tenant is not the property managers who appear to be swamped and overworked its the company's business model. Their offices appear understaffed and the employees always seem overwhlmed and overworked. They need more boots on the ground as they say. They seem to only have a handful of employees managing thousands of properties in Southern California which is just ludicrous. If after reading this review you plan to move forward and rent from this company I wish you luck.</Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>This 5 star review is long overdue. Thank you to LaTanya in the office, Frank in maintenance (and so many others whose names I can't remember). Each time I've needed something, Invitation Homes' maintenance crew has been amazing! I've had maintenance calls approximately 5 times over the last year and a half and I have no complaints - only praises, and I've had different technicians who have all been very knowledgeable, helpful and polite.< /Text>< user>

<review>The entire staff have been amazing and very helpful. Benjamin the realtor the customer service rep Carol in particular. There are a few others but I don’t remember their names. I had some minor issues with the home but because the company has been so on their game every issue is being resolved. I am enjoying my new residence and I am pleased we chose this Property Management Company.< /review><userid>105691347492936380873</userid>< Date>

RUN! DO NOT RENT FROM THEM. You can join thousands of other tenants who say the same in the Facebook Group: Tenants of Invitation Waypoint Homes. You can get help from other tenants caught in their schemes there. MANY lawsuits around the country and a Class Action. RUN! We have all been hurt by their schemes to make investors rich (which they are failing at that) by harming families. - Former tenant<//review>

It’s too bad we can’t offer zero stars.  When we previewed the rental home it had live and dead roaches. It was filthy, and the carpets were old and nasty.  We were assured everything would be taken care of when we moved in a week later.  Once we moved in nothing was done.  After repeated calls, we decided to hired a carpet cleaner and pest control ourselves.  We slowly fixed up the home.  After two years we decided to move out of town, after our move out was done the person said it didn’t look too bad.  We fixed what the person said needed fixing.  A few weeks later we rec’d an invoice for over $4,000.  IH wanted to install brand new carpet, new paint, etc on our dime.  We had a move in sheet that had all the issues prior to our moving in.  This didn’t matter to IH, they still reported us to the credit bureaus.  My wife contacted an upper manager in corporate who stated the carpet and paint were new when we moved in but couldn’t produce ANY receipts to prove this.  In the end, he asked us to pay around $900 and call it a day.  We paid this and pray we never have to deal with IH ever again.<//text>

DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY - EVER!
In the heart of the 2020 pandemic of COVID-19, I received a lease extension offer from Invitation Homes to renew my lease, with RENT INCREASES!  I have lived in the same rental home since June 2014.  Every year, without exception, Invitation Homes increased my rent like clockwork.  This year was no exception.

Three months prior to the expiration of my current lease, of which my rent is slightly above that of comparable homes that are in the exact location and size of mine, Oscar Rendon (DRE #02073326), the designated lease coordinator for the Southern California Invitation Homes (DRE #01950023) office, offered to extend my lease for an additional 12 months with a $50/month increase, or for 24 months with the $50/mo increase for the first 12 months and then a $65/mo increase for the next 12 months.

What business owner, landlord, manager, or person of authority would actually have the nerve to increase costs during the current, world-wide pandemic that we are all experiencing?  Oscar Rendon of Invitation Homes is who.

After receiving such an insulting and rather unfeeling email, I responded to Oscar and reminded him of the current world health crisis and economic troubles.  He in turn graciously apologized and offered to extend my lease without an increase, keeping my rent the same as it is now.  After I thought about it for a few days and reviewed my current and future financial condition, I sent Oscar another email requesting a decrease in rent.  I explained my current situation (which there are many, many people throughout the country, as well as the world, that are in a similar situation), and his response was simply that he would not lower the rent whatsoever.  I informed him that this action might force me to move and that I was asking for the landlord's help in an effort for a win-win proposal.  I can afford a little less rent, and the landlord gets to keep a long-term tenant without having to put in additional capital for leasing advertising, cleaning, showing and paying new lease commissions.

Nope!  He simply said, "no" and sent me the tenant move-out form.  As simple as that.  "You don't like it, then move out!".  Invitation Homes only cares about squeezing as much rent out of their tenants as possible and care nothing about the human beings that their tenants are.

Awful.  Greedy.  No Compassion.  Disgusting.</Review>

<Text>I just want to start out by saying I've been a resident for awhile in "rental terms" going on my 6th + Year with the company.

Through the years we had our ups and downs, but eventually things get sorted out. However this recent issue takes the cake. My home was recently burglarized unfortunately the same week I signed my renewal for another year. I had asked the company if they could do anything to secure the home as our backyard is on a main street and has a measly 3-4 ft. chain link fence that doesn't lock. They denied and said we can upgrade the fence ourselves and or add locks. Funny, because I was told you can't modify the home originally. Also note its the companies responsibility to secure the home.

Fast forward a few days later & $1000 bucks in ( I purchased security cameras and put them around my home ) someone attempts to get in my house via "smart key pad" which was deactivated? or hasn't even worked since we moved in. Notified the company oh they didn't care. I asked if they could change the lock to one without a key pad and they pretty much said yeah we can, but you'll probably be charged. Oh and we have to turn off your "smart home" SMART HOME? I don't have a smart home I have a digital thermostat that uses 2 double A batteries! Supposedly I'm also being charged for it? which I had no idea!

I had even asked if they could move us to another "invitation home" house after the incident since they weren't going to try to secure our home what so ever. You would think it would be acceptable right since we're long term tenants and they would want to keep us, but no. We were told we can apply for another home on their site and pay to break our lease. So much for being loyal tenants for 6+ Years. Might as well break my lease and go to another company.

You would think they would try to keep a loyal tenant and simply move us.

Oh yeh I had even asked for a manager and they didn't even bother transferring me to anyone.

Can't wait until our lease is over. They could careless about their tenants.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The worst management company. They transfer most of calls to a call center to handle emergency and non emergency maintenance requests. They dont have a problem leaving someone freezing in the apartment due to faulty heater. They hire vendors who cannot do the job. They are happy to send you bills and invoices for services done that are not the resident's responsibility and the resident have to call many times to catch the actual local office workers instead of the call center to fight those charges.

Screwy company</Review>

<review>DO NOT RENT FROM INVITATION HOMES! From the day we moved in we did not have hot water, a working furnace, there were leaks everywhere including the sprinkler system that resulted in a $400 water bill! I had to fight with them to issue a credit for this since it was not my fault. Then asbestos was found in the home, which was NOT disclosed to us when we signed the lease. They hired a hack abatement company who let the dust enter the home and exposed myself and 3 kids to a known carcinogen. Now we are going to be red tagged by the health department and have no where to live a week before christmas.<//review>< pictures>

They did my walk through with a kitchen full of BLACK MOLD!!! Delayed my moving in a day for the repair. The house wasn’t ready so I missed nine days of work to be here for the repairs. Three BR two bath and one toilet works and one shower works. I’m only the fifth month into my lease as I’m writing this folks. Then I am now going to court because I had to pay late due to illness and missing work. I paid what they emailed I owed and the next day they served me an unlawful detainer. I’m trying to rent from them until I buy a house but I don’t think I’ll make it until then. They tried to give me a stipulation to sign, two different ones, from their attorneys and the dates were expired and the amounts wrong. They took over $5000.00 of my money after the UD Summons was served, which they aren’t supposed to do, then they returned it when I refused to sign their legal document that wasn’t so legal. Good luck to you five star renters. Your time is coming. Just wait.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Fraudulent company! You have a house listed for rent on 12455 Telfair Ave Sylmar CA, ad says Zillow, an agent called me saying it was Invitation Homes who put the ad, a house and ad that you don't really have as a property for rent, all you do is steal from families! This is an inside job, codes were given to me to access the property! You will all be investigated!

..........update.....

Beware of the California offices employees Christian Ramirez (who claimed to be the manager) in Pasadena.

I tried reaching out to y'all, Dallas Tanner the CEO and not had one call back or email from him as of today!

Christian Ramirez did offer to buy my children's bolts and screw to their bunk beds and my dining table that were left in the property because Christian Ramirez says the cleaners and technician threw them away!? but at least he offered to buy them...not good enough!

I emailed and left a messages for Dallas Tanner and only person to respond was Kim Reynolds the director of customer service who directed me to this David Castañeda the real "manager" of my local office (Pasadena)...you have my number email and I have not heard back from you? This is starting to be a phone tag situation.

This is all very strange stay away from this company!</Review>

I never had a problem with invitation homes until recently. Whenever I had a service request they got it done very quickly and I love their maintenance team. Unfortunately the new year hit and they raised my rent randomly $100?! I've called and left multiple messages for the last 4 days and no one's called me back at all or answered their phones. So frustrating.<//Review>

<review>Using invitation homes has been a complete nightmare!!!! We have used them for 4 years and have been model tenants, we have never been late on rent and we are very quiet. So, it baffles me that upon deciding to not renew our lease that invitation homes would give us such a hard time. In Nov of 2017 we were sent a letter (60day notice) that informed us that we needed to mail that letter in if we planned on renewing or declining our lease, we elected to decline the service because we recently purchased a house so we sent the letter back. We even went as far as writing a follow up letter via postal services and sending emailing in Dec 2017 regarding this matter to ensure our lease would not be renewed, with no response from anyone from Invitation Homes. We had to go on Linkedin to contact the founder of the company in order for someone to help us. Not until Jan 2018 were we contacted by a representative from Invitation Homes saying they never received our 60 day notice, one of their agents by the name of Colette said they probably lost it. After talking with an operations manager by the name of David, he informed us that we would need to write a letter explaining our attempts to decline renewing our lease, which we did, he also explained that if we did not want to renew the lease or be put on a month to month contract that we would have to vacate the home as soon as possible and send pictures of the house once it had been cleaned an emptied so the home could be put back on the market. We had this conversation on Jan 4, 2018, we left the home and sent pictures on Jan 8, 2018. We left the house is such good condition, Invitation Homes used the pictures we took and posted them online as a marketing tool to sell the house. Now, we are being told that we can not get out of our lease until March 8, 2018, and we still have to pay rent even though we have vacated and left the home in selling condition. They are also keeping our deposit. It stressful enough buying a home for the first time but to have to pay rent for another home we don’t live in for two months, even after we followed procedures set in place by invitation homes to turn in a 60day notice letter, and still be screwed over in the process is unacceptable. This company draws you in by making you feel like you a leasing the perfect home until you decided you don’t want to use their services anymore and they start to lose paperwork and ignore your letters, phone calls, and emails in attempts to contact them.<//review>< gmap_id>

Throughout our long home buying process/ escrow we encountered many challenges wether through the seller or city protocols. However, LaTonya Span and the Invitation Homes managers assisted and eased my struggles during my transition. Because of their kind acts, I made sure to leave the house in appropriately clean and kept conditions as I am and will always be grateful to the entire Invitation Homes team for assisting me in the most understanding manner when I saw myself in dire desperation. Our Escrow process was a true nightmare to which my family and I were repeatedly placed in the most difficult and stressful positions anyone can be placed with repeated closure dates changes. We were desperate a few times but thanks to IH, who very kindly understood our struggles; we were allowed to survive the unnecessary struggles and moved forward.
Their understanding and permission for our final move out was a blessing and extremely comforting despite all of the additional barriers and struggles we encountered during a move-out on a holiday weekend.
Thank you LaTonya Span and Invitation Homes!!!!<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

I've never had any issues with late fees, service requests not being taken care of in a timely manner or any of the issues some other renters have experienced. I have had nothing but the best of treatment from Invitation Homes. From the very first day of working with my agent to place us in the home, to each and every phone call made through out the last 3 years. Each maintenance technician that has come to my house to fix anything has been professional, prompt, and knowlegeabe (Clifford and Miguel are the best by far). Service is definitely at the level I pay for.<//text>

This is the worst company I have ever lived for, they care about nothing but getting paid . They don’t care about the well being of families who keep them in business , they’ll allow you to live in unlivable housing and paint over everything like it is ok! They are never consistent and no one ever calls you back. They don’t report work orders and they don’t Care! It’s very humiliating and demeaning to ones character when you work hard to live where you live.< /Text>

<review>This company is crazy when we first came to see the place it looked ok the person who showed it was nice and all. But a few days of being in this home we seen mice running around when i called the office about this matter they said that they could not do anything about it i had to keep bugging them telling them it is it is very unclean to live with mice running around they finally got someone out to fix the problem when i  was having problem paying my rent i ask can i please pay on the 22 of the month they allowed me to do that but each and every month they was calling me asking me when i was going to pay the rent i had to keep telling them that i was allowed to pay on the 22 of the month because that's when i get payed each month i been living here for 3 years and every year the rent goes up 100.00 it don't make any since to me at all why do the rent have to go up every month if you are looking to rent from invitation home just know that your rent will go up I am moving away from this company I have called the office so many times to give my notice and left messages trying to talk to someone and tell them that i wont be renewing my lease and no on has called me i even tried to email the person that is over my lease and her email is not working at all I need to know what i have to do to put in my 30 day notice i already have the house that i am moving into and will be moving out of here this week when dealing with this company be sure you know what you getting into<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dcb7efd2d1e0b9:0x4f4645601190f2f4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Have lived an invitation home for three years. maintenance has been so-so. Never missed a payment or ever had a late charge. We got a notice from HOA the yard needed some work. That was a week ago and we started doing what they asked. Today get home with a 3--day notice to quit!! No phone call, no letter, no email a notice to quit. Really Invitation? Loyalty and fair dealing with tenants mean nothing to these people, why can't businesses be courteous. Never rent from then, leaving at end of lease.< /review>

My hot water heaters pilot went out and the Gas Company could not get it to stay lit.  I called in for service on that Saturday; it was kid of late in the evening.  I did not get to take my usual hot bath that night, but on Sunday morning a nice guy named Michael came by and fixed the hot water heater.  I thought that I would have to wait a few days to get the service that I needed, but I was thrilled when the matter was resolved so quickly.

Thanks,

<gmapID>0x80dcb7efd2d1e0b9:0x4f4645601190f2f4<//gmapID><text>Zero STARS is what I would rate Invitation Homes. Let me start with their customer, there isn’t any! If you call them don’t expect anyone to answer and you may or may not get a call back  until about 1-3 months after leaving several voicemails.

My husband and I have been tenants for the past 5 years. This past winter our heater went out (Dec2017). (Of course during the coldest winter ever). My husband called to notify them of the issue and as usual no live person to talk to or returned call. We finally received a call 2 months later (after purchasing portable heaters) to schedule someone to come out. Tech came out temporarily fixed the issue stated he would have to return with a part and as soon as he walked out the door we had the same issue and he never returned. We called the management company again and of course no response for an additional month. From Dec to the end of February we didn’t have a working heater.

Next issue! We received a letter in the mail (April2018) stating we needed to confirm the renewal or termination of our lease and respond with a 60 day notice (which we returned in the mail as well as left a voicemail stating we would be leaving at the end of June). June comes along and we receive a call from a rep stating they haven’t received any notification from us in regards to the lease termination and of course informed us that if we break our lease and do not pay for the month of July they’ll place an eviction notification on our credit!! So now we are EXPECTED to pay because they “did not receive our voicemail or letter of notification” mind you we have already paid a deposit on a new location to avoid (the slum Lord management company) and the high increase rental fee they also informed us of. This is absolutely ridiculous!! If you’re considering renting from them DONT DO IT to yourself or your family! Their leasing fee increases every year in CA.<//text>< name>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>RENTERS BEWARE - If you want to be ABUSED by your rental company then invitation homes is for you! This company is extremely disorganized They shut off my power and water Christmas weekend because they hadn't notified the Department of water and power that the former resident of my property vacated leaving a delinquent bill. So I spent my entire Christmas in Los Angeles for the first time with no water or power in my home due to the negligence of invitation homes. Finally after many failed attempts they were able to present the property deed to DWP providing that I was not the old resident with the delinquent bill! (talk about dysfunctional) . Finally to bring my experience with invitation homes to even more of an unpleasant ending I have vacated my property for over 90 days now and the property manager I had (David Casteneda) appears to be trying to take my full rental deposit which is $2800. I can't tell you what it's like to spend $800 on cleaning your old home to make sure it's in the pristine condition in which you received it and then the rental company tries to swindle you out of your whole deposit!

<Time>1422647369948< /Time><Review>I am so fed up with this company! We met with the realtor (Lisa) who pas perfectly fine... no problems with her at all. She showed us 3 homes right before christmas and we decided to wait until after the holidays to get a place. Fast forward to the end of January. She re-showed us a house we liked and we decided to go for it. We applied online and sent in the appropriate documents... then nothing. They kept wanting us to send them money ($500) to hold the house for us but wouldn't tell us if we got approved or not. Finally we went in and dropped off the money in person because we were told that we would loose the home if it was not there by that date. Lisa the realtor gave us the name & number of Andrea which is who we needed to be in contact with to get everything squared away. Needless to say we have been calling her now for a week straight and she has not bothered to return our call or contact us in any way. Our scheduled move in date is in about 1 week and we have not signed papers, done a walk through or gotten any kind of official approval (other then a text from the realtor saying she was sure it was all fine). This company has a really poor way of treating their clients</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Invitation Homes is HADES manifested in a corporation. I have no other option than to give 1 star as that is the lowest rating possible with Google. In reality they deserve negative ratings. Seriously, stay AWAY from this blood sucking parasite of a "business". Long story short, they charged us a late fee of $25.00 because our payment was one day late due to the post office being closed on a Holiday...we didn't realize this was the reason we had a balance on our account until over a year later when they took our family to small claims. My Renter's credit has a history of over 10 years, it was perfect until Invitation Homes tainted it all because
Rachel Biloti refused to answer our calls and e-mails to just explain what the balance was that at the time we were unaware of. So we ended up paying there legal fees due to NO customer service, a lying server who claimed to hand deliver a 3 day eviction notice to an adult but in reality gave it to a child and a crooked lawyer who obviously has connections with the court system. Since then it has been an array of problems. Most recent...it took them over 21 days to semi fix an air conditioning issue that left us in 119 degree weather in a home w/out a/c...yet we are still paying for a house which claims to have an a/c. This lead my parent who is a senior to end up in the emergency room. My parent has left numerous e-mails and voice mails with Anthony, Gloria and Pamela of the management team over looking Rancho Cucamonga homes to ask for assistance and all we get is crickets. No one acknowledged my mother's e-mails and the a/c issue is still pending completion. I am not legally savy, but anyone reading this who is, I will gladly sign a petition for this company and it's management team to be encarserated for theft, emotional distress and slander to name a few. Now that our lease is almost up, I am having a hard time finding a new place because of the court case they unjustly slammed us with months ago. Invitation Homes claims to have dismissed it when the were WayPoint, but it came up on my Renter's Credit and I lost an opportunity to rent an awesome location for a lot less.</Review>< Date>

Horrible at upkeep of the landscaping of their rental which is right next door to my home.  I've called in several times and was told it would be taken care of.  1 year later it's still and eye sore - I would hate to get our HOA involved.  The renters blame it on the management company because they are the ones that hire the landscapers.  It's not just about mowing a lawn, it's about having pride in the property you own and making it look nice not only for the neighborhood bur for the renters.  Pulling weeds does not cost a fortune...it's taking the time to care enough to do it.</review>

<review>The worst company you will ever find in property management! There is a reason for all these negative reviews. The company sucks! I started leasing when it was WAYPOINT, then they changed their name to something else and now they are Invitation Homes, but their unprofessionalism, deceptive business practices and nonexistent customer service has never changed.    Where I live, the water company can only bill the property owner, not the resident.  My water was shut off a total of three times and that was despite them billing me for water and my paying the bill immediately. The problem was WAYPOINT wasn’t paying it to the water company.  I wonder how many months I was responsible for a late fee even though I paid the bill on time. You’ll never know because WAYPOINT just gives you a lump sum to pay.
You should plan to do your own maintenance because if you ever manage to get somebody out to your house, their abilities are sub-par.
You know it’s bad when your attorney says, “Oh yeah, I’ve heard of them!“<//review>< userid>

Worst company to rent from. Don't trust them,  I never got calls back from them, they ignored my emails and threaten to sue me for water bills I had already paid for a had proof of payment.

Reach out to the responsible attorneys if you feel like this applies to you.

I just moved into a home through invitation homes about 2 months ago. The home is great so far. The Customer Service on the other hand is TERRIBLE. We have a assistant property manager, property manager, and director managing our property. It is near impossible to get hold of any of them as their VM's are always full, they send you to VM, or they just dont pick up and never return VM or emails. I can write a slew of my problems with them here but ill save you the grief. Will continue to drop stars until they fix their unprofessional habits.

INVITATION HOMES- spare me the BS of your generic responses here. Tell you property managers to do their jobs or find another one.

UPDATE 2: one star now for no call backs. Once again, they lack professionalism on all levels.</Review>< pictures>

Do not rent from this company. Five years we rented a place in in Lake Elsinore in their complex for some members of our family and the place has become a drug infested property. They experienced gunshots, needles and caps on the grounds and general crime. We had complained to Rebecca, Valerie and others there about this and they did absolutely nothing about anything. The 3 children wouldn't go outside to play as it was so bad. We finally moved knowing they were worthless and provided zero support of anything. You've been warned.</Text>

<Name>Sarah Neuhaus</Name><Date>1485453345063<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I started renting a home through invitation homes in April 2016. Mid October, I paid my November rent early, drove it to Corona to the office to hand in my check,  gave it to the lady, and then I left.  Once November hits I called to ask what my utility bill was for last month, since I couldn't attach it to my rent, because october Hadn't been over yet, so I did not know how much the bill was. In November they said my October utility bill was $185, so I drove there with a $185 money order and turned it in.  About a month later,  I go to turn in my December rent and utilities, but first I called to see how much my utility bill would be. They said that they already started the eviction process because I turned in my November rent and utilities separately,  and they "do not except partial payments" i.e. turning in rent and utilities separately.  I then  told the lady that there must be a mistake because none of the ladies at the office ever told me anything of that sort when I turned in two checks separately. Here I was trying to be responsible by paying my rent early because I had the money, and now I'm being punished for it.  I then asked why none of the girls at the desk at the office ever told me that, when they took both of my checks separately. She said that there was a miscommunication. And now their miscommunication is causing me to have no where for myself and my family to go. Midway through December I get another notice on my door that the house that we are renting is going into foreclosure.  But I guess that's irrelevant to me since I'm "being evicted".  These people lack communication skills, they lack any type of sympathy, and they definitely do not have any type of professionalism. I still am confused as to how I am being evicted for paying my rent and my utility bill separately, when obviously I was just trying to be responsible by paying my rent early.  I was never told that there would be any type of punishment for paying my rent and utility bill separately. Now I have an eviction on my record, and I'm due out in six days,  and cannot go anywhere due to the vection been on my record now. Thank you invitation homes, This is great</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Rebecca Rinebolt is the worst to deal with. She's rude, condescending, and inconsiderate. I called her and left a message. She never called me back. After days of waiting, I decided to call her. I could tell by the tone of our conversation that she had already listened to my message, but just never called me back.  After dealing with her and her acerbic personality for about 5 minutes, I finally got her to email me what I wanted.  Even after she treated me like a rented mule on the phone, after she sent me the email, I still tried to be nice and said "Thank You". She totally blew me and my email off.  Thanks for all your help Rebecca Rinebolt.</Review></record>

< Review>
Worst people in the world. They are scam artists. They are horrible crooks and should be protested. Hate these people with a passion. Been here 6 years, never been late on rent and they change dates on legal documents in order to make money and screw people over. O STARS!!!</Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>SCAMMING CON ARTISTS!!!These people are a real joke when it comes to customer service and work ethics. First the agent who showed us the house didn't even give us a tour of the house, he just opened the front door and waited outside and showed no interest in the fact that we loved the house. After applying for the house we found that even their office workers were lazy and impossible to get any response from for information, except for "I'll check" and "We will get back to you tomorrow" which they never did get back to us. After being told for a week that all they had to do was a previous landlord reference I called our past landlord and asked if they had received any calls or messages and they told us they had not. I called and confronted the lady in the office and she told me that she had been trying to call and when I told her I had talked to my past landlord she started stuttering and backtracking her story and while "umm" and "uhh" became her new favorite words she said once again "I'll check on it and get back to you tomorrow." Finally after they screwed up the first contract by forgetting information that was on our application and that we had told them over and over again,we rejected the second contract and decided to go elsewhere.</Text>< pictures>

I have been renting with invitation homes for 6 years know i have never been late for a payment until the other day my banks security rejected the check i wanted to explained this to my rep and right away she started to threaten me with lawyer's all wanted to tell her is that the online pay rent feature had locked me out she didnt care thats there policy if you miss one payment you have to deliver the money in person to there office every month no exceptions i live an hour away from the office i had no choice becouse they leave this notice that says pay up or get out only 3 days they put this on a friday night taped to the door for all your neighbor's to see there closed on the weekend so i hope they accept my monday payment and dont just show up with sheriffs thank you  invitation homes for being an inconsiderate monster i have never recieved such terrible customer service heres a little info about invitation homes every year your rent goes up by over 100 dollars they charge you dog tax plus dog bite insurances if your check bounces you are charged a 100 dollar late fee and 25 dollar bounce check fee you never get your deposit back I learned that the hard way I'm a professional handy man I had my company restore the house better than before plus added free irrigation and paint and yup was still charged in the end if you want to be treated as a criminal invitation homes is for you thank you
(update)decided to bump up invitation homes rating because they have really shown me that they listen and improve from there mistakes recently became a home owner and had to breach my contract with by the way it's extremely expensive 2 times your rent and pro rated whatever extra days you have but other wise since my last incident they have really worked with me to make it a smooth move out</Review>

<review>IF I ALSO COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD. Working with Invitation Homes (Carrie and Monica) has been a HORRIBLE experience and a HUGE wast of my time.  Terrible customer service from the beginning to end.  After several times asking to speak with their management, they refuses to talk or take anything into human consideration and after reading reviews I agree with others that they are fraudulent in they are over charging deposits and can only imagine that if this is how they try to make sales, that their management style for renters HAS TO BE TERRIBLE TOO. I will not be coerced into paying double deposit (with a 700+ credit score), just so they can keep it at their discretion.  My recommendation is to NOT WORK WITH THIS COMPANY.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

< review>
This my first time ever renting a home I read the reviews and was a lilttle worried, but had already started the process with invitation homes I am so glad I did. They are awesome and I am very very pleased with my experience so far.I have had a few problems such as our heater went out on the 3rd day we were here and a issue with our garage door a power outlet went out and a leak with our kitchen sink. I have 7 kids so the heater being out was the big deal for me I gave them a call and next day they had someone out here early in the morning he was very professional and courteous and fixed it in no time. Same thing with the garage door and sink within 2 days everything was tooken care of and they even came out on a holiday. I feel so good knowing that if anything goes wrong I can give them a call and they will come out promptly and fix it.I would recommend using Invitation homes if you are looking for someone who you can trust and depend on. My realtor Vanessa was awesome nice and friendly always met me with a smile and the process was short and simple. Im so happy I chose Invitaion homes< /review>

Horrible company to rent from. Firstly All the information we got when we moved in was false. We were told they would fix the gate to make it dog proof and they didn't. When I contacted them about it they threatened to try to increase my deposit for a pet even though I already paid the max 2.5 months. I had to fix this at my own cost. We were told the gardening of the HOA land around the house was taken care of by the HOA but it wasn't. They then try to fine you if you dont keep the garden outside the property to a particular standard. How it's legal for a rental company to fine ppl like they are some kind police force is a joke. Now if you get a fine they lump it into your rent so you can't just pay your rent and refuse to pay the fine. If you don't pay the "rent" they will fine you more money. These are just 2 of more than 10 experiences like this. Invitation homes is just a typical greedy business that will take advantage of any angle they can and write in all kinds of fine print to screw you over. Do yourself a favor and don't risk all this trouble. I can't wait for the debate about my security deposit I am sure they will try not to return this somehow as well.<//Text>

<review>First things first, I would give this company no stars if that was in any way possible. I am a single mother to two children, one of whom is severely disabled and Invitation Homes has only added unneeded stress to my life. When moving in, it was under circumstances where I couldn't afford to pick-and-choose, however I sincerely regret going with this company.

In the following paragraphs, I will document the reasons behind my complete disdain for this company as well as the employees with whom I have had contact:

1)  Before my move-in was even official, there were many problems. To begin with, the walkthrough was on a Wednesday and still incredibly rushed with the realtor insisting on not staying in a room more than two minutes (maybe because the rooms were significantly smaller than advertised). On top of that, I was told that I could not have the key until Friday, so I made a time on Friday to get the key and do an inspection with utility personnel. Come Friday, myself and two utility men are standing outside the house just waiting for the realtor and the key to what was to be my home. To say red flags came up would be an understatement.

2) My family moved in October and after two years, it was my youngest son's senior year of high school. Naturally, we wanted to stay in the home until he graduated. As such, I asked to simply get a six month lease extension so my son could stay and finish school and then we could all move to a different state. After having multiple phone calls, voice messages and e-mails go ignored, I finally talked to the assistant of my portfolio manager. I was told that a six month extension was impossible: it was either a full year lease (with the annual increase) or a month-to-month deal with an additional $500 added to the rent. The company sees tenants only as numbers on a spreadsheet and does not care at all about their actual lives.

3) The most recent incident is what caused me to finally write a review. To start, the company demanded a $250 pet deposit for my German Shepherd, which was no big deal as pet deposits are typically givens; however, unbeknownst to me, they require a $250 deposit PER pet. Fast forward two-and-a-half years, I buy a puppy to be trained as a service dog for my disabled son who has epilepsy with grand mal seizures as well as severe ASD and other conditions. We have the dog, affectionately named Whoopi by my son, for 10 months with no problems. Then, on December 3rd of this year, we have a technician come out to check the garage and he evidently hears two dogs barking outside and reports it to Invitation Homes. Fast forward almost four weeks later, on December 30th, a notice was taped to my door saying that, within three days, I had to either pay $250, get rid of my second dog or quit the lease - if I didn't do any within the three days, I would be sued by the company and forced to pay $600 in legal fees. The complete disrespect of doing this right after Christmas (especially when it could, and should, have been done in the beginning of the month) as well as not even trying to contact me regarding this matter infuriated me. They could have easily called or e-mailed me to ask if I had an additional dog and then informed me of the deposit per pet policy. But, no. Instead, they chose to wait and then out-of-the-blue provide me with a "comply in three days or get sued" notice. Of course, the representative said they wouldn't charge if we could provide certification that it was a service dog, neglecting the fact that it takes at least two years of training for a dog to become a certified service dog. Additionally, my portfolio manager gave me a snippy, passive-aggressive response when I told her I felt disrespected by the means in which they notified me.

To conclude, this company does not care about tenants or families. Ultimately, money is the one thing they care about and they will find new, and upsetting, ways to pry your hard-earned money from you. If you have a choice in the matter, do NOT rent from them.< /review>< pics>

Staff is nice, but the accountant or whoever handles payment are so dumb. Never been late, so I never worried about their late fees until recent months cuz i have only received eviction notices. I have been paying with Navy Fed cashiers check for the past 3mos ON TIME and have been told me and my family are getting evicted each time!! long story short. Verified with bank checks had already been cashed. Scarlett Gammon said it was an accountant issue but its better for them if i pay online and couldnt explain why the notices were on my door and the emails that were sent after i told her the checks had been cashed and the date. She also could not explain why this situation was considered eviction. but if they thought the didnt have my check why not verify or send a late fee notice...but eviction???? plz keep all receipts and pay with cashiers check or online so it will be easy to verify if they received ur payment. will not be renewing. Been renting with them for 2yrs!! Maybe they have hired new staff. Either way its unacceptable to be told ur getting evicted for non payment after check had been cashed.<//Text>

They pushed me to see the house because they rent out "fast." The guy who did the "walk through" didnt go over any of the house problems it already had with me, he just looked at the master room and back yard, had me sign something and then he left. The house looked ok but I didnt see all the problems it had until moving in the home. On top of paying a ridiculous deposit of like 2300 plus rent of 1480. The windows are old and thin in the front of the house, the wood floors were not put in right and are cracking in a sense, the slider door is super thin and when it rains it gets damp in that area which is right by the crappy wooden floor. The garage is so loud when it closes and opens and the neighbors are always partying and up late, the houses are so close you hear everything. Oh and dont EVER be late on paying them rent cause in less than 5 days you get an eviction notice. I really dont want to renew our lease or go through them again. Idk how these people are still a property management company.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

<Text>Ripped me off on my move out. Took over 1300 from after I had the home cleaned , rugs shampooed and the yard fixed up.
Charged me $50 for a missing smoke detector. Wow.another $700 for painting when they didn't even paint before my move in.

Stay away from this company.<//Text>< Pics>

Hey Lena, Christina, and Janet from the Riverside, Ca office I've been calling for three weeks and no response? On top of that they cancelled my application because I didn't sign a lease within 24. I never received an email with the lease or any information regarding it. Worst customer service ever!</review>

<review>This company is underhanded, dishonest, and predatory in my opinion. I dealt with them for two years and couldn't wait to get out from under them. Avoid them at all cost, you will only be sorry if you deal with them.<//review>< Pics>

Get your nails done any day of the week. Definitely call and make an appointment when you can so you can avoid a wait but Bright Star Nails takes walk-ins.  They do nails for the hand and feet, acrylics, artistic designs, and can add some bling.  Eyelash extensions come out beautiful.  Open 7 days a week!< /review>

Second time I came was horrible..older lady with dark brows was very rude and rolled her eyes at me repeatedly.  It seemed like she did not want to be at work today. This woman truly ruined it for this nail salon and i will not be back. Worse thing was that I recomended this place to someone and I happen to have her with me to witness poor treatment 🤦🏻‍♀️< /text></record>

<review>Made an appt and waited 20 minutes in a chair with no water to soak my feet and not even asked to pick a color. I wasn't about to wait another 20 and see if someone would actually help me.<//review>< pics>

< review>
I've been coming here for a couple years now and I've  always been happy with the results. Clean and professional place. All the ladies working here are super nice and friendly. Helen is the owner and is very sweet. I always have my mani/pedi done by Tracy is is very attentive to detail. My nails last pretty long whenever she does them.< /review>

Paid $30 for gel color and acrylic on my own nails. Also requested a manicure but that never happened! Too expensive just for color and acrylic 😡</review>

<Review>I stopped coming, don't get me wrong some staff is friendly & do an "a-okay" job. However my last 5 or six visits I scheduled an appointment at a certain time & they wouldn't be ready, I did not mind waiting about 5 or 10 min tops but I would wait with a booked appointment 30-45 minutes. Furthermore, I'd be helped & either whomever was doing my nails would leave back and forth to assist somebody else in the middle of doing mine. Not only that, but i'd tell them that I need to be done no later than a certain time & they wouldn't be near done. I have had to return a following day or two because I simply did not have the time. For these reason I stopped coming, aside from the bad cutting around my cuticles which always showed, the powder from acrylics was all around my nails & fingers. Truly it is cheaper but not worth it, i'd recommend going down the street off paramount & south.</Review>< Pics>

All I wanted was a basic mani/pedi. Callous removal and paint for my pedicure, cleanup and shaping for my manicure, not even polish. They managed to leave my feet more rough than when I came in, messed up the polish on my big toes and had to redo both and filed my nails into uneven and jagged messes. I tried to show the woman the shape I was looking for and told her I didn't want my nails shorter because I had an event I was going to ok a of couple days. The first thing she did was file them shorter and even split my thumb nail at the end. I left before they could do more damage.< /text>

<Time>1562956916686</Time><rate>1<//rate><Review>(Translated by Google) I will never go back. I CHOSE 3 colors. And they wanted to charge me 3 dollars more than because they are many varnishes I told them that they were for 2 fingers only I thought it was an abuse I have done it other times I NEVER had done that. I do not know if I'm fine or them but for me an abuse It's not the first time I'm going, I'm a client there. But it was my last time.

Nunca regresare. ESCOGÍ 3 colores.y querían cobrarme 3 dólares más que porque son muchos barnices les dije que eran para 2 dedos solamente me pareció un abuso lo he hecho otras veces NUNCA me habían echo eso.no se si yo este bien o ellos pero para mi es un abuso. No es la primera vez que voy soy cliente de ahi.pero fue mi ultima vez.</Review>< pics>

The food is always great. Service is slow sometimes, it can be busy. So if you are in a hurry let them know and they do .... The the sushi rolls are all crafted with savory detail and specific flavor combos that just work. Very solid place for lunch or dinnr< /text>

If I could give this place a zero star I would. Came in at 8:30 when their listing says they close at 9pm was told rudely by the lady at the front desk “last call is 845” I politely showed the lady my phone that said it was 8:30 and she told me “well we aren’t taking any more guests would you like to place it to go.” Absolutely horrible customer service, their food had been great the one time I went before but I won’t be returning based on the customer service at the door. Also change your google listing if this is your actual policy! Trash<//Text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>Service has gone down. Went there as a party of 3 around 2:30pm on a Wednesday. Hardly anyone was there. The servers and manager was just standing in the front. They forgot our water, chopsticks, and napkin. I had to walk to the front to ask them for service. Our food came 15min separately so everyone ate at different times. Sad to say but after years as a patron, we won't be back here again.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Food was bomb, and staff is friendly. This was the first restaurant I've been to in over a year due to the pandemic, and I couldn't have been happier with my service. I got the Lion King Roll, and the Shrimp Tempura Roll, along with the a sake sampler. Everything was fresh, and on point. 10/10, would recommend.< /Text>

<text>Service was horrible. Got seated around 6. Did not get our food til 7:30. They really need to hire more staff. The food was good once we got it but it took so long.

horrible service. they’re horrifically understaffed. came at around 7:30 pm and waited over an hour for seating. there were tables available but we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. the food is mediocre and not worth the long wait. will not be coming back.</review>

Awesome place to have a some great sushi with a great view. Nice selection of some specialty rolls and some sashimi. Appetizers are great like beef tatake and karage. If I'm in the area I always pass by here. Call ahead for reservations since it gets busy on the weekend.<//Review>

All staff and customers masked, except while eating. Tables distanced, hand sanitizer available. IMO they should have asked those waiting on a table to wait outside. Had to walk thru a small crowd to get out. Outside patio dining available.  Disappointed they stopped offering sake flights, but I get it.<//text>

I've been going here for years. Since I lived in Alameda. Always consist fresh food with stellar prompt service. Food always comes out really fast. At times you may face a wait but not really much of a wait as they go pretty fast.</text>

One of my favorite places in Alameda! I always can count on Sushi House for great Japanese American food. The bentos are huuuge to the point where it’s difficult to finish them. The sushi is also very well done, and who can forget the rolls?!</text>

They always have great food. They even have food for Vegans!
During Covid, I suggest you order online because the wait time is 45 mins to 2 hours!</Review>

Probably the best sushi in Alameda. Best for price to taste ratio. Good enough for flavor town.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The sushi from Sushi House is phenomenal and one of the most freshest joints I've been to in a long time. It's worth the money that you paid for it which is not out of the roof it's spot on clean environment exceptionally wonderful and personable staff wonderful customer service. The chefs do an amazing job. Just let them know exactly how you like your sushi and they can do it. One of my top places to go in the Bay Area.<//review>< Pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>Nice location with bay views. Sign yourself in on the tablet/wait list. Lots of parking. Long lines during busy times. Not sure why it was so busy or rated do highly on Google. This was the first time I ate a $100 meal at a restaurant and was given plastic spoons and forks for dining in. Sushi was not impressive. Ordered the sashimi dinner. Salad, white rice, soup and fish. Hamachi was not fresh, probably frozen and thawed few times. My son loved his kids plate tho. Great deal on that meal and tasted good.< /Review>< pictures>

Consistent and reliable,  this Korean sushi house is popular and always busy. There is usually a wait but usually not too long. Rolls are perfect but if that doesn't bother you, then eat here.</Review>

BEST sushi in town!!! But unfortunately, the WORST service in town as well. I'll continue to patron just because their sushi is so good, but will never expect any type of great service. Kudos to the chef's- not so many kudos to the servers and staff.<//text>

First time here, definitely wont be my last. The service was fast and they checked in on us regularly, which I like. We were able to be seated right away despite the place being very crowded. Music plays in the background and there’s huge flatscreens that has the Lakers game on. The food was delicious and the portions were very consistent and big. The price isn’t too expensive, but definitely well worth the price.< /Review>

The miso soup tasted like real miso soup. The ambiance is casual. You get a nice bay view as well, which goes perfectFood service is fair speed. Tenzaru udon was served cold. The flavor was slightly bland and the texture was mildly over cooked. The lion king, and blossom roll were good. The bento boxes had a large selection. The food in from the bento boxes were filling enough. I'd rate them as a B or B+. Would I eat here again? Probably< /text>

<Review>Best sushi in the Bay Area! One of the most renown and longest business that has overseen the days of Alameda, Sushi House is know for the best sushi around town. Growing up, I would always come to sushi house with family or friends and even birthday events.

My favorite to order here is the bento box known for its large size and various types of food that comes along with the box. You have two choices of teriyaki beef, chicken, or salmon along with California rolls. I also love to order separately the Lion King Rolls that tastes absolutely delicious with salmon around the sushi roll with rice, avocado, crab meat. I also recommend the raiders roll as well. I’ve been starting to learn how to eat raw, but hear from my family and friends that the raw sushi is superb. Highly recommend to everyone to come to sushi house!< /Review>< pictures>

I go to this superb place from time to time since I love the special air that is outline this restaurant. The team is very welcoming and qualified. The service is pretty quick. Also, the food they serve is magnificent. I visited many times and I was always happy. The rate is honest. I highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.<//Review>

<text>After visiting Sushi House on NYE, we decided to dine here on Valentines Day. Unfortunately, both the food and the service were terrible. The server never checked on us and our drinks were never refilled. Shortly after our food was served, we discovered the rolls were not as we ordered. The server argued with me about the accuracy of the dish before agreeing to fix the error. The replacement roll had zero crab, and the saddest pieces of salmon I've ever seen. This was a massive disappointment because we chose to eat here specifically for their Orange Blossom roll, which was excellent on previous occasions.< /text></record>

Sushi House is a local favorite of the people of Alameda. Whenever people think sushi in Alameda, Sushi House is the go to place. That is for good reason. The food here is very good and consistent, however, big surprise it is the sushi that really shines. Every time that I go I almost always end of getting at least 2 of the various special rolls. The portions here are also very sizable. However the prices here can be quite hefty as well as the wait time. I have never come here and not waited for a table and I have never paid less than $50 here.<//review>

<Review>The restaurant was fabulous, the food was large and delicious, and the sake was cold. It loses a star, sadly, because of the service. It could have been where we were sitting, the rush hour of dinner, the restaurant being short-staffed, or any number of reasons. We had a difficult time placing orders, getting utensils and napkins, and even getting glasses for the bottles of sake we ordered. However! While this docks them a star today, I will be returning due to the food and atmosphere, in hopes for better attention from a server, any server. (All in all, I recommend this restaurant if you like any sushi. They have traditional nigiri and sashimi, as well as the non-traditional rolls we Americans love.)</Review>< rating>

The Tekka Don is to die for!!  Fresh sushi, reasonably decent service and a great location. Don't expect too much from this place because it's a little assembly line like so you won't get any personalized service or any real interaction with the sushi chefs but the food is really really good.< /review>

Best sushi place in Alameda! Our favorite sushi place this far due to the reasonable prices and large portions received. Would definitely recommend. The service isn't the greatest; this is one of the places you go to for the food not the top-notch service. Gain one thing and lose another I guess.<//Text>

<Text>The wait time was pretty long, but that's a given at Sushi House. The food is great and the fish tastes fresh. The chefs really know what they're doing. Even thought the menu is quite extensive, everything I've ever had there is great. For folx who are sensitive to sound, definitely try takeout because for eat-in dinner it can get pretty loud and overwhelmingly cacophonous.</Text>< UserId.>

Quality has definitely went down over the years but for what it's worth, the large sushi rolls are still worth the price in my opinion simply due to its size<//review>

It's good for where the location is but mediocre if you compare it with others around the bay.
Service and atmosphere is pretty decent
Their portions are generous for the price
Parking lot out front is pretty small so its advised to park around the plaza during peak hours, especially during dinner.

Delicious, a bit pricey but what can you really expect from a nice place like this- the rolls were good. I did hear a complaint once across regarding "dry textured food"- but from my half-dozen visits in the three months I had went there; I never had that experience.</text>

As much as I love this place... The   service it ok, The food is ok, but an order of a one 3 kind bento And a Boston roll takes 45 minutes... Something is going wrong in the kitchen! It's been happening more frequently lately!</Text>

But if you're coming here for great service as well, you won't find it here.  Most servers (not all) have attitudes and never bother to smile. They only come to your table once when you are seated or take your orders, and then to give you your check once you're done. Other than that they never come by to check how you're doing or if your needs are met.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< rate>

<Review>We had a big party. The food was great. Not sure why the left dirty dishes at our table, even after we asked several times for them to come and remove them. Customers don't like to sit and eat with dirty dishes around them. When someone is finished with their plate.. remove it.  Anyway the food was amazing. Get the Lion. Get 2 lions. They are even good the next morning. If not for the the service it would have been 5 stars.<//Review>< name>

<Text>We ordered 2 bento boxes to go yesterday for lunch.  We have been longtime customers and fans of Sushi House for years and have always been happy with the food.  Unfortunately we were shocked at the poor quality of the food we received yesterday: Chicken Teriyaki/Tempura bento and the Salmon Teriyaki/Tonkatsu bento. The tempura was ok, but the meat in all cases was dry, overcooked, tough and frankly tasted day old.  For $15/bento, I expect better.  It was disappointing, especially since it was for my partners birthday.  We understand that it's a struggle for restaurants during the pandemic, but when customers try to  support local businesses, it's important to treat their customers in return with respect.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Do not ever go here. Was incredibly disappointed. Went here for a late lunch while traveling in alameda and my waiter never refilled my water, never acknowledged me after taking more order and I only received half my order. As soon as I went to ask about it the very rude waiter cut me off and just said “it’s coming” and walked away. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told that the manager had just stepped out, no apology for my wait or water or anything. Do not recommend and will not ever come here again.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><Text>The only good thing about this place is the service. I remember why I haven't been there for over 8 years during my last visit.

1.  The rice to ingredient ratio in my sushi is 2 to 1. The sushi is enormous because they put so much rice in it. All you taste is rice not the other ingredients.

2.  I ordered tamago roll for my daughter and they decided to put lemon in it. Why???? That's the dumbest thing I've ever encountered.

3.  Conclusion is that it's not sushi chef making your sushi but people disguised as sushi chef and doesn't know what they are doing. You can make sushi but if you don't know why you should or shouldn't put in an ingredient, you're just a cook and not a chef.

I don't recommend this place if you're looking for a good Japanese meal. You won't be seeing me back.</Text><UserId.>111311944135909107345</UserId.>< time>

< Review>
We ordered 2 bento boxes to go yesterday for lunch.  We have been longtime customers and fans of Sushi House for years and have always been happy with the food.  Unfortunately we were shocked at the poor quality of the food we received yesterday: Chicken Teriyaki/Tempura bento and the Salmon Teriyaki/Tonkatsu bento. The tempura was ok, but the meat in all cases was dry, overcooked, tough and frankly tasted day old.  For $15/bento, I expect better.  It was disappointing, especially since it was for my partners birthday.  We understand that it's a struggle for restaurants during the pandemic, but when customers try to  support local businesses, it's important to treat their customers in return with respect.</Review>

The only good thing about this place is the service. I remember why I haven't been there for over 8 years during my last visit.

1.  The rice to ingredient ratio in my sushi is 2 to 1. The sushi is enormous because they put so much rice in it. All you taste is rice not the other ingredients.

2.  I ordered tamago roll for my daughter and they decided to put lemon in it. Why???? That's the dumbest thing I've ever encountered.

3.  Conclusion is that it's not sushi chef making your sushi but people disguised as sushi chef and doesn't know what they are doing. You can make sushi but if you don't know why you should or shouldn't put in an ingredient, you're just a cook and not a chef.

I don't recommend this place if you're looking for a good Japanese meal. You won't be seeing me back.<//Review>

I am a 9 year old reviewing on my grandma's phone. The portions are huge, the food is rocking. It isn't the cheapest, but worth it. Service is good. Seating may be scarce during dinner, but least busy if you're having a late lunch. Good location and staff. Big parking lot. Next to a mall. Wait may be long. Remodeling looks very modern. To-go fast. Car wash place across the parking lot. My favorite roll is the Crunchy roll, non-spicy.<//review>

The place can get a little busy. The best sushi in the Bay Area period! It’s diverse and inclusive. A little pricy but worth it. Service needs improvement but over a great place and would highly recommended. This place gets 4 stars. 💎💎💎💎< /text>

This is a very popular sushi restaurant with the locals.  Almost always full with a boisterous atmosphere.  The freshness of the seafood is good.  The teriyaki could be saucier but most come for the rolls.  So many to choose from from raw to fried to baked.  I like to pick up but if they say 40 minutes make it more like an hour on the busy nights.  If you make it there before your food is ready keep a diligent eye for your to-go bags because they may forget to call for you.  All in all pretty darn good Japanese food!< /Text>

We are food hunters, we travel for food 80% of the time SO WE LOVE FOOD! And as food lovers we always expect great service at places we go. It didn't happen at this restaurant, neither the first time we went there, neither THE SECOND ONE! (BUMMER)  But, we wanted to give it a second try ... Nope, FAIL!  It was even worst than the first time 😱
We checked in, waited in line after 7 people ahead of us, we finally got our table ( 3rd table to the right of main entrance to be exact and hopefully they remember us.) So we placed our order and people who ordered first than us got their food first (as it should be, first comes first served, right?. ) Oh well, that rule didn't applied to us... We were waiting for the food to come to our table... 15 minutes, 30 minutes ... Not even the miso soup... People who were waiting after us got their orders, ate, drank, enjoyed their food and left while we were still waiting!!! So I got a little upset since the two tables next to us were almost done with their food and we haven't gotten even a salad at that point! We decided to call one the  waitresses and ask if by any chance our food was being cooked? Guess what? The other waitress didn't put our order! Really? How in this world waitresses are going to pass throughout our table, serve people next to us who just came in and not realize that we were there waiting for our food? HELLO!
We had to wait around 30 extraminutes for our food to come to our table.  They apologized and gave us a "free salad"... Really??? After making us wait for an hour?
I would give this place zero stars if google had the option!</review>

<text>My wife loves the sushi here, unfortunately I cannot enjoy the food as well as she can as I cannot eat raw fish but the udon and cooked rolls are equally as good. My favorite dish there is the nabe udon. They also have good side dishes with meat that i can eat. If you can't eat raw fish but have loved ones who do, come here and you will not be disappointed.</text>< Date>

OMG. So much more than a sushi house. Authentic handmade fresh selections. Hot baked or fried ,cooked or raw. Vegetarian fish meat selections. Sake served at the table. Soups amazing. Great customer service.  Eat at the bar or table for a crowd.  Get there early get there HUNGRY.< /Review>

The food here is always good, add a beautiful view and you are set. The prices are reasonable however the service can use some improvement..It took a good 10 minutes before anyone came to take our order, and we usually had to hunt someone down to either refill our drinks or bring us a sauce or seasoning..it became a full house (per usual) so I would suggest to management to maybe plan better in regards to scheduling to provide better service .<//Text>

Food is always good, but as always it is the wait and sometimes the servers are always in a hurry to get your order and not helpful for my guest from abroad. This is the 1st time it has happen, and i dont know if that particular server was having a bad day. Still this is a good place you can grab food near the Oakland airport.< /Review>

<Text>Portions are big, but the quality is awful in terms of the fresh fish. While the fish itself was not really that old, the way it was cut was terrible. I have been here a few times and everytime I have the fish especially the sashimi is always cut horribly. It seems like the chefs only know how to cut certain types of fish property, as different fish can have different techniques of cutting due to the way the grain is set on the fish. Also I would not go near the bathrooms at all as when approaching them, there was a very weird sweet and odd odor the last time I went.< /Text>< pictures>

This place is always gonna be packed on the weekends. So I'd definitely recommend coming here during the middle of the week to have a relaxing experience. Food here is great and the place is amazing. Would give it five, but like I said it gets really bad on the weekend and you're gonna be waiting forever to get a table.<//Text>

Updated from 5 stars to 2. I had great sushi here but the fish quality is below tolerable. They do provide very large amounts of fish compared to other restaurants but the fish has a lot of visual imperfections and fat which usually would be removed prior serving.<//review>

The food was really good, we ordered the big boat i think it's called the yacht. The only complaint would be the outside seating heater was uncomfortable for the peole sitting close to the window. It got way too hot and the beers got warm. Besides that inconvenience,  the service was great and the food amazing. Next time we will sit inside.</text>

Great food. Communication between waiter was a rush. First time customer. Ordered simple teriyaki meat over rice and got full bowl meal with salmon, veggies, etc. Meal was super, but adding salad, soup and sushi we was full, a bit over stuffed. However we will go again, make sure we make a smaller order.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>the food is good but the service absolutely terrible. We waited 1:35 minutes for a table and when we were seated at the table they told us to order fast because they were going to close
and when they brought us the food, a young lady came to pick up everything from our table.
Soy sauce, napkins and I still did not finish my meal and took my plate. We seriously think about not paying for the food. but we paid and we promised not to return to that place.<//Review>< pics>

Sushi house shrimp tempura is very good also most of there items from the sushi menu. Anything else stay away from like the teriyaki chicken which is over cooked and dried out. Service sub par especially the time just before their dinner hours.< /Text>

Solid place for sushi and Japanese fare. Very busy usually, often with a wait. Recently re-done interior made for a little more room. Staff is efficient. Close to the water (Alameda shore is just across the street).<//Text>

<Time>1531166977815<//Time><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Despite no one greeting us and then shoving menus at us like i was bothering them when i asked if there was someone to seat us, the Sushi was good I guess. but they have 1 restroom for a beach side restaurant that must have had 100 people in it.  It was disturbing how they had someone sitting in front of the door and occasionally peeking in to tell you whether you could go in or not depending on if there was already a man or woman inside. The line stretched through the restaurant. I would not go again<//Review>< pics>

<Review>The food was fresh, good (if you like Japanese cuisine), plentiful, well presented and timely served. I took half of mine home.
They must have trouble with beachcombers using the restroom facilities. It seems they close every hour 'for cleaning'! And only one was open at a time.</Review>< Pics>

Great Japanese food. I like their bento boxes. I usually ask for Teriyaki salmon and sashimi. They have large TVs so one can watch sports. Wobbly tables can be annoying. Cheers.</text>

<review>Having read some comments on here, it's kinda funny! Been coming here for over 15 years of course there sometimes we have to wait a bit due to popularity of the place. Love the kids who are serving. They're great kids and so the freshness of my orders every time and all the time. It has a good view of the East Bay too.<//review>< Pics>

The food is great, but the customer service on the waiters is the worst. The manager should have a talk to the staff and make them understand that customer service is what keeps customers coming back. Hope they turn this shio ship around before it sinks because i love their food.</Review>

<Review>The Lion King roll here is truly the best. We go to other sushi restaurants and Sushi House always has the most delicious one. Their other rolls, bento boxes, and rice plates have always been satisfying as well. One of my favorite restruants. Service and atmosphere is usually great too.<//Review>< Date>

I didn't eat at the restaurant. I was Postmating but the atmosphere is nice. Right by the water but busy. I waited 30 mins for a Togo order. I'm rating off of atmosphere only.<//Text>

My favorite American style sushi place. Their Lion King roll is to die for. The sashimi is also very high quality. It's a little on the pricey side of things, but the portions aren't bad.< /review>

Good hours.
Very popular restaurant. Fortunately it is fairly large.

If there is a wait list, you can see if there sushi bar has seats available.

Excellent menu with huge selection of items.
Try one of the combo plates with sushi, soup, entre, side, etc.<//Review><Name>Rayne Iona Johnston< /Name><user_id>117667387473048635924<//user_id><response>None</response><date>1527791394733</date>< pictures>

Though it's a long wait, they have huge portions and good food. We always end up taking something home. Their rolls are super creative and filling too. The baked salmon roll seems to be very popular</review>

< Review>
Horrible customer service here. I was hoping to be seated at the bar to wait there, since it was going to be about a 30 min wait. The host really rudely told me not to seat there, when the whole bar was empty. The food was OK but it took forever to get served. After I have gotten my food the waiter told me to switch tables. After we got all of our food he noticed that there was just no room for us to manage with all the food in the ridiculously small tables that the have. He asked if we wanted another table to put all of our food there. Finally after we were ready to start eating again another waiter comes and takes the second table our first waiter had given us. I was super pissed BAD BAD service. Do not recommend.</Review>

Update 11/01/2019: really disappointed with the quality of the food, I ordered the bent box ($23) Ca roll was warm and mushy, also the tempura veggies we way over cooked. I will not be back any time soon.

Food was good, but I've had better service at McDonald's.

Just brought my daughter and her friends there for her 11th birthday and I really  had to try to force a smile and good attitude despite the unfriendly host and impatient server.

Always has awesome sushi and lots of options for plates, a la carte rolls, desserts, and drinks (beer, wine, sake, sodas). The only thing keeping me from giving them a 5 star rating is that on multiple occasions the servers have forgotten to bring small items. Mostly miso soup or extra rice. Never charged for it though which is good. Also gotta love the views of the bay from here! Definitely a good date and family lunch/dinner spot.</Review>

I think people used to come from all over the bay for this place but I dont think it still lives up to that reputation so it gets some bad reviews.   The sushi is still very good, they have a wide selection,  and it overlooks the bay.  It is very family friendly,  for better or worse.  Be prepared to wait on most nights and it can be a little loud.<//review>

<Time>1489275191623</Time><rating>3< /rating><Text>I guess this is the place to be when you're in Alameda. Cam here on a weekend night and there was about a 20 minute wait for 2. We weren't picky about where we sat and go the bar. We could see the chefs making sushi which was cool and hoped that it was ours every time they passed something over the table. We got the Bay Scallop, Hella Hot and Island to share. They were all okay. Nothing in particular stood out to me. I like the baked rolls (Bay Scallop), but it was just alright for me.

Overall, okay sushi, decent prices.<//Text>< Pics>

At 8pm at night it seemed there was only 1 sushi chef and we got 1 roll at a time about 20 min or so apart...we got 4 rolls. My boyfriend and I ordered only veggie rolls as we are vegan and they weren't the greatest. It's also sad when they offer a vegetable udon, but vegetarians/ vegans cannot eat it cause they use the same broth for all soups...fish base. Most places I've gone offer a vegetable broth for the vegetable soups so more have the ability to enjoy. Don't think we will be going back anytime soon.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Came with fish eating friends, they picked through there rolls trying to find parts that were edible.
My food didn't arrive until they were mostly done eating.  When i ordered I made clear I wanted vegetarian.  One of my dishes was covered in fish flakes.  They did eventually replace it.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user>

Authentic and a huge menu. This is a great location for anyone wanting to enjoy great views of the Bay while eating some of the best sushi I have had in a very long time. The menu offers a great mix of American favorites along with traditional food. Anyone who complains about the price has to realize that quality and environment isn't cheap. Yet, I did not find the bill large for two people with out alcohol.</Text>

Eh, it was good but not 50-60 a person good. 🙃 Also the wait was pretty daunting. Maybe I am cheap. Maybe I am just not used to everything costing 3x what I usually pay in the Midwest. It was meh.</review>

We have been going to the Sushi House for over 10 years now. We use to go almost twice a week, however for the past 2 years we have been avoiding it. Quality of the suchi has gone way down. Now they have become big lump of rice with little fish, and roles are way too big and falling apart. It looks like they are trying to increase the size of the pieces by adding rice and justifying their price... It is sad to see a good restaurant go down like this.<//text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>Sushi house is slipping a bit. 1 of the reasons besides the food people continue to go to a restaurant is the service. Last time I went, the service was terrible. Took way to long to come over, brought out bits and peices of the order so, I started eating before my companion who basically got her food when I was almost finshed. It was just ok. Disappoiting because I remember when they first opened and how friendly they were. Now ehere are they getting these servers from. Go back to the drawing board and remember the principles you opened the restaurant with.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b</gmap_id></record>

Great-tasting, quality food!!! This is our go-to Japanese restaurant. We have brought our relatives here who aren't from the Bay Area, and they've all loved it. Service may take (quite) a while on busy days though.<//text>

Lots of options for plates and a la carte rolls.  Sushi is always very fresh, and the service is fast.  Great views of the bay is a bonus.</Review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>This is a very busy resturant. You can get on the waitlist early if you go through yelp. The sushi was good. I got the $110 boat for the table. This is the chefs choice of sushi but it is 10+ rolls so decent deal. Bummy part was that the rolls did fall apart with minimum pressure.</review>< pictures>

<review>I have yet to figure out why so many people go here. The service is unfriendly and slow, and the sushi is not fresh. I have been there three times and have tried multiple things and they all are not pleasing. There are soo many better places to eat in town than here.

Most consistently good sushi restaurant I've been to in the area. The fish is always fresh and the Lion King roll is the best one I've had! The menu also has a lot of pictures so you can see many of their specialties. There are also Bento and Bowl-style meals if sushi isn't really your thing.</Text>

I ordered the sushi "to go" around 3:30 PM on Mon., April 12th, 2016. I had the Rainbow Roll and my Husband had the Spicy Tuna Roll. My Husband brought it back and it was HORRIBLE. I had to spit mine out. My husband said his was bad too. The fish tasted very old. We order or "eat in" once a month at the Sushi House but for the last 6 months, it's been really "Not Good" at all. So today we have decided to never go there again.
You can ALWAYS get Very good sushi at another place...its at the corner of Broadway and Santa Clara. (Front door on Santa Clara side). I don't think I can say the name of this Sushi Restaurant but it is ALWAYS ALWAYS GOOD!<//Review>

Over the last five years I've probably been to Sushi House 20 times and have always enjoyed excellent food. My most recent visit was lacking in service and food quality. I'm hoping it was just an off day for both the wait staff and the kitchen.< /review>

My guess is this restaurant would have a 4-5 star rating if you factored out the lousy service. I've patronized this restaurant for years and the service has never improved only the food keeps myself and family from returning. Their workers seem to be poorly trained or just really don't care. It's unfortunate because this restaurant is in a really nice location and does prepare good food.<//text>

Not the friendliest service but the food is absolutely delicious. There is always at least a 20 minute wait every time I come here. One thing ti note is that they only have one restroom so the wait can be long and you may have to wait even longer if a person of a different gender is in there.< /Review>

< Review>
#Alotoffood. I enjoyed Sushi House! I was hungry and looking for a decent place with a good value. I came to the right place, because I won't go hungry eating here. I ordered a combo, but instantly wished that I went with sushi and rolls. It's a odd habit of mine. I always want some kind of meat and tempura with sushi as my side item. If only there was a way I could not get full on the the combo stuff and make roll for at least one roll. I guess I need to bring more people so we can share. I was so jealous when the table next to me ordered the Raider Roll! You know I represent, but I had way too much food in front of me to support the roll and my favorite team.

The parking situation can get a little crazy since it's on the corner of the shopping plaza, but I'm sure if you get there early for dinner this won't be problem. I was about to park near the front. The location near shoreline is the best part. This is a perfect for a date and affordable enough for the average college student.< /Review>

It was pretty good. Had the teriyaki chicken bento box with my second as teriyaki beef. The chicken was amazing as was the tempura soup and salad. The beef was terrible.< /review>

They have not mastered the covid-19 restaurant experience. The outdoor dining is literally painfully cold. I never complain about a place being too cold, but sushi House outdoor dining area is in an ice cavern. They have overhead heaters, but none of them were on. There's a cold wind blowing between a glass shield and the building.

Service is extremely slow. I understand that they are targeting the doordash and take out customers, but the service for both of them are also extremely slow.

Finally, what used to be a spicy tuna roll tonight was a tuna roll with a blob of sriracha sauce on top.part of what makes a spicy tuna roll tasty is that the tuna and Sriracha are mixed and refrigerated. A blob of sriracha makes for a uncomfortably spicy, poorly balanced tuna roll.

My two star review is a downgrade from what used to be a four star review for this restaurant. some restaurants have succeeded with the covid-19 procedures. But sushi House has not.</Text>

The service was kind and prompt but the quality of the fish wasn't great. I ordered the fatty tuna app and was disappointed. I also had a seaweed salad which was served on top of a bed of lettuce to make it look like you were getting a large portion. Lastly i got a spicy roll that was falling apart when served and was mostly vegetables. Overall I wasn't thrilled but it was cheap and right next to the car wash where I was waiting so I may go back.< /text>

I've tried this place a few times in a stretch of 8 years and the service is bad for non-asian patrons. The service is obvious.... no refills no are you OK, nothing just the food and Bill at the end. Asian get treated and get better service here.<//Review>

Horrible service ...  can't comment about the food BECAUSE THEY NEVER BROUGHT IT! Server took my order, brought salad and soup, then brought my wife's order, then she disappeared ... when I told the busser (the only one who ever stopped at the table) that I never received my dinner he says "well we won't charge you for it"  ... really? Like I would pay for something I never received?? Their only response was "sorry" ... there's a reason this place has only 3.5 stars when almost every other restaurant in Alameda has 4.25+ ... they don't appreciate your business ... don't waste your time or patronage here ... spend your money where the customer is appreciated< /review>

If you love Japanese cuisine, don't eat here, it'll bring you nothing but heartbreak. But if you like cheap food with low-quality ingredients prepared with an empasis on presentation over flavor, knock yourself out.</Review>

I've tried this place a few times in a stretch of 8 years and the service is bad for non-asian patrons. The service is obvious.... no refills no are you OK, nothing just the food and Bill at the end. Asian get treated and get better service here.< /text>

They have not mastered the covid-19 restaurant experience. The outdoor dining is literally painfully cold. I never complain about a place being too cold, but sushi House outdoor dining area is in an ice cavern. They have overhead heaters, but none of them were on. There's a cold wind blowing between a glass shield and the building.

Service is extremely slow. I understand that they are targeting the doordash and take out customers, but the service for both of them are also extremely slow.

Finally, what used to be a spicy tuna roll tonight was a tuna roll with a blob of sriracha sauce on top.part of what makes a spicy tuna roll tasty is that the tuna and Sriracha are mixed and refrigerated. A blob of sriracha makes for a uncomfortably spicy, poorly balanced tuna roll.

My two star review is a downgrade from what used to be a four star review for this restaurant. some restaurants have succeeded with the covid-19 procedures. But sushi House has not.< /Review>

I'm not a huge fan of sushi.  This place is just ok.  They can get super busy and crowded at dinner.  I assume people go here for the fact that it's eight next to the beach.  My son likes the beach and so we go here occasionally to eat.  The fish meal is probably one of the better choices.  Though I have been here probably like four times and not eaten anything because I've had a few very meh experiences.  The portions are big at least.  I got to katau once and it was not good.  Also had tempura once that was Soo.  The rolls look good but the best values are the meals.  Still we'll go back because my son likes sushi after the beach.< /Text>

I give Sushi House a solid 3 stars, the sushi rolls were good, but not spectacular. The bento boxes were huge, the over all quality and quantity was definitely a good value for the price. For two people we had sushi rolls, bento boxes and soft drinks all for $77.

The menu is quite large, five pages. One page is nothing but pictures of all the sushi roll with the name listed under neeth. Great idea for anyone new to sushi.

For dinning out midweek, I was very suprized how busy it was. We didn't feel rushed, but the wait staff seemed to be overwhelmed. At one point I think I counted six sushi chef's behind the counter, but three or four wait staff to deal with well over fourty tables in the main dining area. This is most definitely a high volume establishment.

I was disappointed with the fact that they did not have any seared items, Like seared Ahi tuna. Also be prepared to take home left overs.

If you are new eating sushi or have never tried it but have wanted to Sushi House would be a good place to start.< /Review>

<time>1340679017914< /time><review>Not the world's greatest sushi rolls, but they are HUGE. For under $40 for two, I can walk out of here absolutely stuffed (+1 for that because I usually walk out of sushi restaurants still hungry after dropping $100).

I think this place used to be a Coco's or something, and it still feels like it inside. The atmosphere is loud, a few tables look like fold-out card tables to squeeze more people in, and it almost has a cafeteria-like feel. I was expecting a food fight to break out at any time. But you do get a decent view of the water.

So go to get stuffed with mediocre sushi, but don't expect an upscale, top-notch sushi restaurant.</review>< gmapID>

Would have given th is place maybe 3.5 stars for good food and view...HOWEVER...after 3 times I've been here there's always a wait to sit and long wait for drink, food, etc. Even forgotten orders put in waiter blamed in "new slow cook". This waiter repated back my order wrong...and big negative on the stars rating. .please get separate bathrooms if possible.  Potty training a little girl isn't pleasant after being allowed in after 2 males exited....1 without washing their hands ...both toilet seats up and wet. I dont think I'll be back soon.< /review>

The service and food can be a bit hit or miss here. I like coming here for their sushi lunch or nigiri mix.  The place is very close to the beach, so you get a really fantastic view from inside. There is also typically a pretty long wait for dinner on weekends (getting seated, and the subsequent service).< /text>

Good setting in this shop, not for everyone. It's not a world rated sushi quality, but the I like the distance to the beach for a walk and the overall setting.< /Text>

Food is actually really good. But it's super crowded, and noisy, not really a nice atmosphere to go for dinner.</review>

Food is pretty good, quality is good for the price. However, there is bit of a wait depending on the time you go, also their service is very bad, the waiter was very angry and inattentive.

I would still come here but not at late lunch time to avoid the wait.</review>

Seems like nearly every time I come here the service is bad. But today the service was fine but the rolls were falling apart and the tempura was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for an hour. I had to send it back.
Also in observing the entire sushi bar and those making the Sushi etc. 10 out if 11 were not even Japanese. All I can say is that it showed in the way the sushi was rolled and prepared. This will be my last time here. It's just not authentic and I think management is doing a poor job. Too bad really cause it's in a great location.<//Review>

I have been here many times over the past few years and have finally caved and decided that getting take out was a better option.  You might be wondering why this place is always so crowded when the service is so poor- it's for their rolls!  Decent price and huge!  So as long as you come expecting just that you'll leave feeling full and happy.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Good food but rice was packed loosley which only made eating sleightly harder than usual. Still the time there was good and the was bearable despite the amount of people waiting to get in.
I'll go here again when I'm in the area next.</review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Service was terrible, waitstaff ignored us and only responded when we asked about a table. The island sushi had gobs of roe on the top, and the spider was cold giving me the impression it was refrigerated and they didn't take sufficient time to cook it. Totally disappointing. I used to eat there several times a week when I worked at the court but my recommendation is tempered by the service and the quality of the food. Oh, they only had 2 people cleaning the restaurant so it wasn't very clean.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Not bad for sushi, but not the best. Sashimi tastes fresh and cut well, but the rolls are too large for each piece. The tolls aren't rolled tightly either so stuff just falls apart. They do, however, have a ton of special maki and temaki, as well as a few cooked sushi dishes, so it's a great place to introduce folks to sushi. We got the sushi yacht and 4 rolls for 6 people and it was way too much food. Still pretty good for a family place.< /Text>< pics>

Super dependable. Open late. Solid sashimi. And great bento boxes and teriyaki dinners. Plus, servers can be really nice. Tonight I asked for no rice since I’m trying the Whole 30 diet and the guy serving us brought out a gigantic salad with avocado and sprouts and tomatoes as a substitute. That was very cool of him! :)< /Review>

Ok, if you want good quality sushi at a reasonable price, go to Sushi House. I had the deluxe chirashi here and it was awesome! They were very generous with their portions, including the uni, which is a total win in my book! :D<//Text>

< review>
Ordered for a pick up and was told to come in 30 min. When showed up the food wasn't ready and had to wait another 35 min. when got home it turned out they charged me foe a sushi roll that was't in the box.When called to tell them the person on the phone said that I will have a credit for that amount when I come next time! I'm not planning to come next time!! They also forgot to put a sauce on one of the rolls and low sodium soy sauce as we asked. The food is hit and miss. One day it's fine and next done in a sloppy not appetizing way. My dinner was ruined last night and next time going to the place that treats the customer better.< /review>

Hey, Alameda has it's tourist traps too!  Crummy food, both the sushi and stuff from the kitchen.  Always a wait, which totally confuses me, but yeah the view is great.  There are many far superior sushi places on the island.  Save your money.</Text>

I'm sorry to say that the service here is pretty bad.  Although the last time we went we had a server that knew how to cater to our many kids we had with us.  But usually they're really busy and don't really take enough time making sure we had water, napkins, etc, unless we asked for it.  And sometimes they place us at a table where a child seat really gets in the way of everything.  I give this place two stars (**) on my more than two kids friendly meter.  And when it's busy, which is most of the time, no place to put the stroller if you've got one.< /Review>

The sushi quality is middle of the road, any environment is almost cafeteria like. It used to be very cheap, but now it's so popular that the prices are at or above those of much better restaurants. It is by the beach. Unfortunately, there isn't always enough parking in the lot to support the huge number of tables inside.< /Review>

Long story short, paid about 30 dollars for two rolls, ateless than half the food. Worst rolls I have ever tasted in my entire life. Last time I went to sushi house.< /Review>< rating>

The rolls are overstuffed.  The fish is fine if you stick to nigiri and sashimi.  Sleeper hit is the softshell crab appetizer</Review>

This place is reasonably close to my office, so I go here for lunch/dinner quite often. We also had a few company outings here. This is not really authentic Japanese restaurant. One of my Korean coworkers told me the place is owned by a Korean. The food is still quite delicious though (approved by one of my visiting Japanese coworker).

My favorite is the Sake Don. It's basically slices of salmon sashimi, tamago on a bed of sushi rice. They also give slices of lemon. Very fresh, very delicious, generous serving. What more can you ask?

As for the rolls, the serve several fusion dishes like baked scallion rolls. It's definitely different, definitely can't be found in Japan, but definitely good. Bring friends so you can share different varieties of rolls, or just bring a date and enjoy a short walk in the beach afterwards (bring layers, it can get pretty cold).<//Text>

Worst service experience I have ever got after coming here for over 22 years. I was totally ignored and they walked around me to seat other people. I had to beg for my order to be taken. Someone needs to find other work as they should not be in the service industry.</Text>

Bit of a disappointment here. Waited over an hour to eat mediocre sushi. The price was up there, but not the quality. Their sushi was ok but the temperature was off (almost room temperature). Oysters were nice and fresh but their $90.00 boat was mixed. We opted for the all sashimi option and most of the fish taste fresh but again the temperature of the sashimi was on the room temperature side.

Their rolls were a bit on the sloppy side and was ok.

Service here is spotty maybe because they're busy. It was also very room in the restaurant.

I miss Kamakura...< /text>

<resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b< /Gmap_id><text>I often go to Sushi House because it is close and affordable.  The wait for this restaurant is pretty long and it lasts late into the night.

I usually get the bimbibap salad which is a bed of salad greens tossed with chrysanthemum leaves and roughly chopped raw garlic and topped with sashimi (salmon, tuna, and tako).  They give a sweet and spicy Korean hot sauce so that people can customize the spiciness.  A bowl of rice is also provided to chow down this dish.  This is a delicious and refreshing dish although not always a hit because of the raw garlic and potential less than premium fish.

Everyone always raves about the Lion King Roll, which is pretty good, but not necessarily worth the almost $12 price tag.  The roll is a baked salmon roll with a sweet miso mayo sauce.  Tasty, but if you have tried it once, try something else on their extensive menu.

Also Sushi House is Korean owned and operated, not necessarily important, but if you are looking for authentic Japanese food this might not be that place.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Sushi doesn't taste the same anymore. I remember the first time I came here I really loved it, but every time after that, was only decent. The service there is really bad, and kind of rude. The chefs were nice but the food now is kind of bland.</text>

I've been here over 300 times in the 15 years my family has been going to Sushi House. Expect to wait an hour and have the worst service ever. The food rewards the wait.<//text>

Bad food - old stinky fish.
Bad service - nobody says hi to you, nobody welcomes you, you ask something and they forget about you.
Bad environment - crowded, noisy and stinky.
There are way better places to go for food in Alameda, avoid this one<//text>

I wanted to see the hype because it seems like Sushi House is famous, even for those not that familiar to Alameda.

I ordered the 2 item bento box with salmon terriyaki and tempura (1 piece of shrimp and a few veggies). My friends ordered a lion king roll and orange blossom roll, and the other ordered the katsu donburi. The bento box and katsu donburi come with soup and salad.

The sushi came out first. The orange blossom roll wasn't bad, the salmon wrapped around tasted fresh. But overall nothing impressive. The infamous lion king roll was fine. But definitely not rolled very well. Just picking it up it fell apart.

The katsu donburi bowl came out next. I didn't try any of it but my friend seemed unenthusiastic. She was picking around it, and the katsu looked soggy.

After about 20 min my box finally came out. The tempura was cold and bit soggy. The salmon was warm. It seemed like the entire time I was waiting for my box, my food was just sitting there. Meh.

The service was poor. Our waitress seemed rude and every time we asked for anything we'd get an eye roll. We didn't get spoons when she dropped off our soups (we just drank it from the bowl because we were starving) and then when my friend asked for a spoon for her katsu bowl, she handed her a plastic spoon. Seriously? There was a waitress that was going around filling waters and also cashed us out, she seemed nice though!

Do I see the hype? NOPE! There's better sushi places to eat in Alameda.</review>

Sushi is decent, little pricey but the rolls are big. However,  nowadays I feel they put so much excess rice..< /text>

grumpy receptionist...I waited 1 hour for a service to go ... It was supposed to take only 25 minutes, the receptionist very rude ... This was my favorite restaurant, the second time this happens in 2 weeks, it seems like I'm doing her favor ... I caught some super cold food, and without any kind of excuses!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The place is clean and tidy, parking is convenient, next to the beach, the food is delicious, the amount is sufficient, the price is reasonable! The waiter service is attentive!

(Translated by Google) You have to book a seat with your own computer. You can sit there. There are elderly people who don’t know the computer. Can’t make a reservation. Very unhappy. It takes a long time. Entering is slow. It is much faster than writing by yourself.

<review>(Translated by Google) The restaurant has a good environment! There is an invincible sea view, there are a lot of parking spaces at the door, and the sushi sashimi tastes good and variety! It often bursts into the sun shed, and you must have patience when you are late!
