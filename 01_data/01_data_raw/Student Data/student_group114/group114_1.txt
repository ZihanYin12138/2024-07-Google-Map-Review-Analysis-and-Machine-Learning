They were the best price for Ceramic Tinting. We called around and “Cash” was very informative on the process and prices. We were very pleased with the outcome and the difference it made in temperature in our car. We have black leather seats and it was hot 🥵 having the tint is clutch! Thank you Ms. Cash! You guys were great! We’ll be back!<//review>

<text>I came into Precision not knowing anything about window tinting and with central valleys humid weather, it's best to get your windows tinted before summer hits! Would highly recommend anyone to go get your windows tinted here at Precision, especially with Cash, she's very helpful and great customer services. Will come back to get my front wind shield done pretty soon!<//text></record>

I rarely post a review but felt it was necessary in this case.
Professionalism from start to finish. I explained I wanted to tint the front windows on my new 4Runner but had a limited time frame to get the job done. The Precision Team quickly scheduled a time that would work, Cash greeted me with a smile as I came in and within the hour I drove off with my windows looking exactly as I had hoped at a price lower than expected!

If you are looking to get your windows tinted, Trust me when I say... Call Precision Window Tinting!< /Text>

For Christmas I got a gift certificate for window tinting and was so excited to see it was for Precision! I had seen their name all around town and heard nothing but positive things, so I anticipated a positive experience and sure enough I was right! I called and got an appointment the SAME DAY! When I arrived, I was greeted by Cash at the front desk and she was extremely friendly and helpful. She explained the whole procedure and walked me around to show me the different tint options. When I got my car back 2 hours later I felt like I had a whole new car! I can’t stop looking at it. No bubbles or wrinkles anywhere. I love the choices we made on the tint and I have already told everyone in my family to go see them!  The customer service, attention to detail and overall experience is 10 out of 10! If you’re looking into window tinting I highly recommend Precision!</review>

Decided to wait a little to post this review. Got my windows tinted on a brand new 2021 GMC AT4 on 12/22/2020. Absolutely amazing job no bubbles haze or wrinkles. All I can say is they were phenomenal from start to finish even when I changed my mind on the front two windows tint percentage. Cash was absolutely pleasant to work with and ill be back soon to get the front windshield done. I will say this in closing when you pull up and all the cars in the lot are on the higher end you know you made the right decision.</review>

Had all of the glass on my Husband's 2020 Ford F-250 tinted darker than a steamy scene from "50 Shades of Grey." We were VERY happy with the overall professionalism and attention to detail of their installers. That front office staff, especially that Cash gal made the entire experience that much better! Let me just tell you, the windows on my Hubby's F-250 weren't the only thing that left wet!<//Text>

I recently purchased a new car and on my drive home from the dealership Precision Window Tinting was the first place I called to make my appointment. Last summer I had Precision Window Tinting take care of my wife's car at the recommendation of a friend. Excellent customer service and local owners delivering a high quality service. The ceramic window tinting makes a huge difference in the level of heat inside our cars. Besides looking amazing, the heat reduction in our vehicles is the number one reason to visit Precision Window Tinting. I dropped off my new car in the morning and before noon it was ready for pick up. Everything looked clean inside and I could tell that they took care of my car and we're very considerate to leave no trace of the fact they were working inside of it all morning. I highly recommend Precision Window Tinting.< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x80945bdcd45ccd05:0xa46cc91139c1046<//Gmap_id><Name>Leah Maez<//Name><Review>I got my windows tinted on 12/09/2020. As far as the windows themselves, they look good. It’s only been a couple weeks so we will see how it turns out, but so far no problems. However, the one issue I had was with my window panel. Long story short, it was not put back in correctly and I felt like they were trying to shift blame on me saying that for my type of car they do not take the panel off. They even looked at the paper work that they kept on my car and said it couldn’t have been because of taking it off. They suggested maybe I spilt something on it, but I didn’t drive it since I got the windows done. They were nice enough to pop off the panel and they were able to see that when someone put it back on it did not click back in place on one side so that was why my buttons were not working correctly. Although my issue was resolved, I feel like my review reflects my overall experience. I had to go back and forth twice to get it fixed and from the paper work they found it said the panel was never removed but I think it was clear that it was and put back on incorrectly.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I highly recommend Precision Window Tinting Company to everyone. The windows turned out beautiful. No more glare! I can keep the curtains open to see out and still have privacy that people cannot see in. With the tinting my pictures and furniture will not get faded. It really keeps the heat out so my energy costs will be lower. The installation was fast and such friendly and hard workers. I highly recommend Precision Window tintingy company to everyone. You'll love the results!</Text>< username>

We can’t say enough good things about the entire process! Jeff and Shanna know how to run a business and make you feel like family. Every interaction we have had with them has been amazing! In the office we dealt with Cash and Janna. Professional, helpful and friendly. As for the tint on the windows? Amazing job done by Jeff and Braden! With this current heatwave we can tell the difference in our living room where we get the majority of sunlight. We really couldn’t be happier and highly recommend Precision Window Tinting!< /Text>

Jeff and his team were on time, super professional, and super conscientious! My husband wanted to tint the south facing windows in our house, and I wasn’t sure if it would look good....but now that it’s done, I’m so happy!! Embarrassingly, I had actually resorted to living with blankets over the back of my couch and towels on a sofa table because the sun coming in through the windows was so strong I was worried it was going to ruin my furniture. It looked like there was a homeless encampment in my living room LOL. Now I can take all the crazy blankets and towels off everything and actually have my home looking nice again!

I am EXTREMELY picky, and I was so impressed with them. They carefully moved the furniture that was in the way, then once all work was performed, they even moved it back into place!!< /text>

I have had many cars tinted over the years. But there has been no company like Precision from the first contact through email to the day of my appointment customer service and response times were top notch!! And the attention to detail on my tinted windows was excellent! Shanna let me know exactly what was going to be done and we chose the right shade. If you want the very best customer service and top notch work you need to call the people at precision you won’t be disappointed.</review>

The actual tint and window installation turned out good but I had to go back multiple times due to my car door panel being improperly reinstalled. It was a minor inconvenience but if I had work it would have been major to have to go back multiple times.

For my car it cost $250 for the doors and back window with lifetime warranty. Another minor issue was that I wanted a 10% tint but they only offer 5 or 15 as the darkest tints.< /review>

It’s alright. A few bubbles here and there. They also didn’t cover the whole window with tint. They stop at the edge to the top of the window. This was my first time going here rather then going to house of the shades. Overall my quality of the tint looks great.<//Text>

We just had our bedroom windows tinted by Precision and we can’t say enough great things about their service.

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>A big thank you to Jeff and Shanna of Precision Window Tinting in Clovis. Jeff and his crew did a wonderful job installing film on my family room and bedroom windows.  They also did a great job on the front door glass panel.  What a huge difference in my home!   I’m going to enjoy having the drapes open without the worry of sun damage to my furniture. Also, the color of film Jeff suggested makes my windows look beautiful!  I’m so glad I contacted Precision for an estimate.  They are professional and take pride in their work.< /text><userid>117437551439590680010</userid>< Gmap_id>

This company knows what customer service is all about. I called there shop to get a price for my new 2020 Nissan Altima and Shanna answered all my questions and helped me with what shade to choose. I was able to get in the next day, when I arrived Shanna greeted me by name which was very impressive. The tint on my car came out beautiful and to top it off they wiped down the whole car because I brought it in dusty. When I picked it up Shanna went over all the directions and walked me to my car!!!If you are looking for 10 star service from start to finish this is definitely the place to come to. I now know why some of the large new car dealerships use A Precision for there tinting. I will definitely be referring family and all my friends.</text>

<Review>I had my windows tinted on my Ram truck because I spend most of my time in the truck. I had the two front side windows done and I notice a huge difference in heat. Before my left arm and face would be burning up but not anymore. I’m going to have them do my windshield next. They do quality work and have great pricing. In fact I messaged them though the website on Sunday evening and I got a quote in less then 10 minutes! I highly recommend taking your car here.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1566957769631, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review our business it’s amazing customers like you that make us successful.

Yesterday I took my car in to get the windows tinted and WOW! I was just BLOWN AWAY at what an easy, and amazing experience it was! The owner, Jeff, is an old friend of mine and when I stopped by Precision Window Tinting Co. last week he was just as friendly as I remember, so incredibly informative, and extremely accommodating. I used to get windows tinted because it looked good but now that I have kids especially, Jeff really educated me on all the benefits that come with GOOD tint that I never knew about, and he was available the next day to get it done. My car was in and out, done FLAWLESSLY, and the customer service & expertise provided by everyone there was unbelievable. You just don't get customer service like that anymore. They communicated with me throughout the process to make sure that I was getting the best job for my needs and made sure that I was in full understanding of the after care and warranty during pick up. I referred a friend to take her new Telluride to Precision within ten minutes of driving off their lot. It was HOT when I picked up and my car had been curing in the sun for over an hour. When I got in I couldn't believe the difference. The sun has no chance against this ceramic tint. No reason to waste gas "cooling off" your car before getting in OR scorching yourself on your seats and steering wheel. It's beyond a noticeable difference; it's like 90% cooler than it was prior to tint. I HIGHLY recommend that everyone go see Precision Tint!! Living in this HOT valley you will not regret it!< /text>

After reading the reviews online, I stopped in today to get an estimate for my car. Not only was I greeted promptly and courteously, Jeff fully explained the tint dynamics and his suggestions for my Audi (that I'm finicky about). They offered to complete the tint today and at a very fair price. I agreed and they even went as far as dropping me off and picking me up from my place once it was done. Tint looks great and the customer service is unparalleled. Well done Jeff & Shanna!<//Text>

Just wanted to thank the staff at Precision window tint for the great tint job they did on my new Lexus. They were very informative and the staff was so nice and friendly. They even gave me a ride home when my other ride canceled. My windows look great and my kids will be nice and cool this coming summer. For all that are looking for the best tint shop in the Fresno/clovis area look no further Precision is the best not only there work but there staff. Definitely a 5 Star business!!< /Text>

I can't say enough good things about this company. I brought my new 2018 mustang GT in and have been thrilled to work with the professionals at precision tint. From the first call to completed job, they have been top shelf. They are half the cost and double the quality. If your wondering where to get your tint done, stop looking, give them a call, you won't be sorry. Jeff and Shanna, thank you both so much, the car looks awesome!!<//Review>

They happily took my car in on that Sunday! I was super grateful for that because I wouldn’t of had any time for the next couple of weeks! The job was amazing and quick! The price wasn’t at all bad and very reasonable! Oh AND! I hit a bug on my front window driving over there and I was super disappointed because I JUST washed my car but i realized whenever I got back in my after my windows were tinted that they cleaned it off!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1525102829222, 'text': 'Thank you so very much for the 5 star review.

Extremely satisfied at the quality and level of professional service provided as I went through the process of tinting my car window. Another competitor had quoted me $200 for the peel and new tint of my rear and back windows. However, when I arrived to my appointment, the same work quoted over the phone was now going to be $340 plus a possibility of a damaged antennae. Disillusioned by the misleading business practice I called up Precision Window Tint for a quote and spoke to Shanna. For the peel of the old film and new tint, I was quoted $225. The amazing part was that I did not have to make an appointment at the time and brought my car right in. When I arrived the price quoted over the phone was honored plus there was no mention of the possibility of a damaged antenna. My car was ready in about two hours (4-5 hours quoted by competitor), and the quality of the work was stellar. I will recommend and go back to Precision Window Tinting not only for the quality of the work, but mostly importantly the way they treat their customers.</review>

I usually don’t post reviews, but this amazing company exceeded my expectations. The prices are by far cheaper than any other competitive out there, both in Fresno and in Clovis.
The wonderful lady upfront was very friendly, and she helped me pick the right shade for my two front doors to my Honda Sport.  They took me in as a walk-in and had my car ready in less than an hour.  I was so pleased with the quality of work that I decided to return a couple days later, so they could tint my front windshield.  I can’t wait for my front windshield tint to dry, so I can have them place the dark visor shade ontop.  Again, the price was 80% cheaper than the cheapest competitor in Fresno.
I honestly was afraid to have my windows tinted by a company that was so cheap in pricing, but I’m glad I followed through.< /Text>

The ceramic window tint turned good no complaints there. But someone left a open bottle of "Spraymaster The Chemically Resistant Sprayer" in my backseat and got ALL over the rug of my brand new car.</review>

<review>My provider at the A Street clinic was amazing. She listened to my concerns and helped me find the right treatment options. I was prepared to have to fight for what I wanted but she took the time to listen. I hope she stays at Camarena because it seems like all the good Drs leave!< /review><gmapID>0x80940c64ce573737:0x6da7d65cf854dc9e</gmapID>< Date>

I have a job and couldn’t just reschedule or I would have gone somewhere else I have super high anxiety and not once did they mention before hand that they don’t use laughing gas whatsoever. They saw I was shaking and have anxiety and were honestly rude when I expressed and I didn’t think I could sit thru it with just the local. Then at the end when the dr did the stitches I could feel the pain. I left there office shaking and having an anxiety attack. As an adult and mother I will never bring my child to that office after being treated like that nor every trust your office. You should tell your patients your too cheap to offer what other offices do</Review>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I appreciate Camarena health centers so much. They are quite professional and courteous. The girls are all wonderful and friendly. Dr. Jadaun is an excellent doctor who is always aware and definitely on top of his game as a doctor. I am a caregiver to two elderly people 24/7 Dr. Jadaun is an excellent doctor looking after all 3 of us and asking the right questions to get to nitty gritty of situation. Whenever Ive had an emergency I get a walk in appointment set up. They call me within a few minutes of my appointment. I'm telling you in all my years of living here in Madera and Fresno never such a professional and attentive clinic than Camarena health. If I ever move out of town I am hoping to keep them and Dr. Jadaun as my healthcare providers.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>They are very friendly and the people in the front desk are always willing to help everyone. They have 2 floors and they sometimes are pretty slow so, be prepared to wait. Earlier in the morning is much better and guaranteed to get you in sooner. They have restrooms and baby changing compartments. Always make sure to call ahead to confirm your appointment because sometimes they will change them.< /Review>< pics>

It's a shelter and I hate to see animals in cages but on the positive side they are adoptable so give these wonderful animals a home. With that said this shelter is so clean aside from a slight animal scent which is to be expected the staff here keep this place so well maintained and well organized. The animals all seem well tended to as well which I was very happy to see. They are also quick to be of service to their customers. I greatly appreciate they're assistance in helping to retrieve my cat. Thank you everyone< /Text>

Great place to find a life long friend. The staff genuinely care about the animals here. We have rescued 2 dogs from devore over the years. Its really a great value when you factor in the cost of spay/ neutering and shots.<//text>

As far as animal shelters go, this one was clean and the dogs were quiet. They were open only by appointment. It's time to let potential adopters in.< /Review>

The kennels are kept clean, they have a lot of adoptable dogs. For those who want to see the adoptable dogs/ animals  you need to give them a call for a same day appointment,  due to covid.< /Review>

Our new family member Pixels McIndoe. Devore shelter is the perfect place to rescue. Our four legged friends really need love. I couldn't imagine our kitty being erased from the earth without experiencing a loving human bond.<//Text>

< Review>
If you go to ANY San Bernadino shelter ask the staff why Frank MACOMBER wont allow blankets or PVC cut beds for the dogs.
I have been in rescue for close to 9 years now and this particular shelter or pound I should call it because it is a kill pound has some of the nicest people working there! I absolutely will Network dogs out of here again just because if people are so courteous and friendly. I live an hour and a half each way from here but at least it's clean kept well and again I cannot say enough nice things about the employees! Always always adopt don't shop and spay and neuter!< /Review>

I once needed a furry cat friend
The DEVORE animal shelter
had the perfect cat. Service and staff were excellent .
Now my cat is lost.  Staff members are helping me to find my cat . They even printed lost cat flyers for me.

<Review>Although this place felt smaller and looked like it wasn't updated it was clean. I honestly wasn't expecting that. The staff was wonderful. They had a paper on the counter for me to look at to see if there was any cats I was interested in before I went into the cat room. I will def go here again.<//Review>< pictures>

I found all Creatures to. Be well-cared for, clean. Well-fed. In good spirits. The three vet Techs were personable and caring.
Many pets are available for loving families.
The adoptions are processed fairly by drawing names. Canine,Feline, Equine &
the occasional "other". Make a visit. Make a new friend.🐶🐯🐴🇺🇸</Text>

The people I dealt with were nice, from the outside it looked vlean.  I didn't inside because of the Covid situation.  I DON'T LIKE THAT THEY KILL  CONSTANTLY.  AND I'VE HEARD THAT PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO BERING IN TRAPPED CATS WITH COLLARS, TIPPED EARS.  AND THE SAME PERSON SEEMS TO DO A LOT OF TRAPPING.  NOT WITH A RESCUE GROUP.  IF A STRAY/FERAL CAT IS BROUGHT IN AND NOT PICKED UP BY A RESCUE GROUP...YHIS CAT IS KILLED.  SAD COULD BE PART OF SOMEONE'S FERAL CAT COLONY.  WELL. THAT'S MY COMMENT< /text>

FYI... If you try to do the right thing you get punished,  VERY BAD BUSINESS!.. I found a dog rured it in , doing the mandatory 4days to see of it has an owner. Told the shelter that I'm interested in dog and they put me myinfo told me to call back Sunday  .. so called back sunday and they said that there was some interest in the animal so there going to do a raffle.. that this is there standard procedure.. not first come first served , so I have some vested interest I tried to find the owner was unsuccessful,  so I called them to go through I thought was proper procedure  i told them in the beginning  I was interested in the dog and I get this..smh.. so unfair!<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Kennels are clean and staff clearly care for the poor souls who end up here. They are always professional if a little too clinical but given what they see and how the public treats them it's to be expected. I think people leaving negative reviews aren't being realistic. We don't have the resources other municipalities have, low kill shelters are ideal but not always feasible. I hate that animals have to be euthanized or housed in cold kennels but that's the reality of it until people wake up and stop buying puppies from backyard breeders and puppy shops. We need mandatory spay neuter laws before we can reasonably expect low kill shelters in our community. In the interim I feel the resources allocated to Devore shelter are used well and the staff do the best they can.

I'm adopting another fur baby today, my 3rd from this shelter and I wish I could take more home! Bottom line before you say negative things about this specific shelter and it's policies, please consider your own choices and actions first. Do you sterilize all your pets and encourage neighbors friends and family to do so? Are you politically active, and do you vote? Do you know how your tax dollars are allocated and how your local city and state reps vote on animal rights issues? If your answer is you don't even know your state Rep then go back to the drawing board.</Text>< Pics>

Just rescued a sweet husky from this shelter a little over a week ago. I was heartbroken by all the dogs there who needed homes, but the real problem isn’t the shelter- it’s people’s unwillingness to spay and neuter their pets!

The staff was very kind and helpful and the adoption process was very easy. They seemed genuinely caring and helpful when it came to rescuing these dogs.

My dog is warming up to me really well and is such a sweet girl. I’m trying to find a way to adopt another pet- wish I could!</review>

We went to Devore about three or four months ago looking for a dog. We found one we wanted but we were told that she had to be adopted through a rescue and shipped out in a hard crate because she had growled at someone. The dog was a husky and the main thing we noticed about her was how sweet she was so this was hard to believe. We were told if we could get a rescue to take her we could adopt her through the rescue. The staff said there was plenty of time to get this done because the shelter wasn’t full so there were no dogs on the kill list. The staff also gave us the name of their Facebook page and the name of a rescue they claimed to work close with. So we started looking into how to get the process done to get the dog and while we were at it we checked out Devore’s Facebook page. The Facebook page had a list of dogs on the kill list and nearly every dog we looked at in the shelter was on it including the dog we wanted. Many of the dogs were also listed as needing taken out in a hard crate. During our research we found out that the shelter made more money if the dogs were adopted through the rescues. Because these people blatantly lied to our faces about the kill list and the fact that many of the dogs listed for hard crates were very sweet I personally believe this organization is a crock. This situation affects my rating for this shelter but so does the health of the dogs that we saw there. Most of the dogs looked like they were starving or sick. Many of the dogs I could see their ribs. I sincerely hope that their quality of care for their animals has gone up since we have been there but I doubt it has.</Text>

The Animal Control Officers were helpful to find out what happened to my cats. Apparently my neighbor has been trapping cats to send to Devore Animal Shelter. ( this is legal to and Animal Control Evan provides the traps for people to do it).

By the time I figured out what was going on it was too late and they had both been killed! 😭
These two cats were feral cats (that I could pet) that I befriended, had them fixed so there would be no more kittens in the neighborhood.<//Text>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>I visited this place yesterday and the first thing I noticed when walking out to see that animals wad the smell. A dog was obviously sick or scared because there were runny feces all inside the kennel. The dog had nowhere to go except in the mess. I did like that they gave you a sheet with all the available animals on it. Also almost every dog had ticks. I secretly pulled a few off a dog because I felt so bad. Maybe the area is prone to them but when i st every dog had them, they did. One dogs whole ear was covered. I did like that they had misters for the hot days. When I rounded a corner there about 4 or 5 wasps flying around some water. There must be a nest nearby. I wish I could be the volunteer here to pick ticks off of the dogs. I also wish I could just take them ALL home.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c34e328a2987fb:0xdbec06e1341499db</gmapID></record>

<Review>I lost my dog and lucky someone called when they found her but before that I visted this shelter to see if someone turned her in. It is a really nice facility and the staff were considerate even though there was a bit of a wait time. They walked me through all the kennels then gave me other places to check and resources. Their lost pets list is updated every hour unlike MANY shelters<//Review>< Rate>

This place has been here in our community forever. When a dog ends up here it's because it was found running loose or it's owner has decided to relinquish it for "whatever" reason. This shelter doesn't have a choice the way some shelters do. They HAVE to take every stray or owner release on their catchment area.
The people who work here have, over the years, been exposed to some of the most awful, animal hating people you can imagine. They have had to euthanize thousands of the most beautiful adoptable dogs and cats simply because "their time was up" and new ones were brought in that day HAD to be taken in.
The facilities are old and we all agree the county is understaffed. They do the best they can with the resources they have.  Is the beautiful? NO. Do they do right by the animals? I believe they do. I have found them to be caring people that have had to "toughen up" their personalities in order to be able to do this most difficult work. In closing I'd like to say if you really like to save a life, rescue from the Devote shelter, at least start your search there.</Text>

I am writing this review in great hope that it will shift the consciousness of anyone that is considering dumping their animal at an animal shelter that euthanizes animals. I know that you are probably thinking that someone will adopt your pet, or that some fantastic rescue group will step in and save your dog just in the nick of time. How I wish it were true that every single animal that sits in a kill shelter would be saved from taking their final breath waiting for a forever home that never materialized.

If you truly love your animal and can’t keep them for whatever reason, I ask that you do everything in your power to find them a loving forever home. As a volunteer at an animal shelter I can tell you that the most beautiful, loving, trustworthy, friendly animals in our communities are losing their lives there, don’t fool yourself into believing that they only euthanize feeble old animals, everyone is fair game, and everyone needs to be moved along to make room for the new batch of animals that are constantly coming through the shelter doors.

The shelters will tell you what can we do? We have no choice but to euthanize, this is a problem created by society, we’re cleaning up their mess by destroying these animals. Shelters will continue doing business this way. It’s up to us as citizens to step up to the plate and take care of our animals until they are old, there isn’t a day that goes by that they don’t give us every ounce of love that is inside of them, they run to the door to happily greet us when we get home from work, they cheer us up on our saddest days, and they are happy to share every minute of their lives with us. Don’t turn your back on your animal and betray them by dumping them at an animal shelter that kills animals.< /Text>

<Text>I was just there today and I have to say the shelter staff is extremely nice. We walked in a couple minutes before it opened, thanks to a lady who opened the door and welcomed us in. We walked in and immediately asked if we had a certain interest and an animal and showed us a list of available animals at the shelter. We told them which one and immediately a shelter staff member took us to kennel like area with a bench so we could play with puppy. I was there playing with it for over an hour and not once did a staff bug me if I was done yet like many shelters do. When I was finally done playing a different staff member came in and the puppy was obviously excited to him, proving how their dogs do know they’re safe in their hands. We also walked around a shelter staff asked if we were interest once again. The prices at the shelter are very reasonable and the cages are kept well clean. It is a high kill shelter so even if the dogs are well maintained while there, it’s not promised they’ll make it out. But it is obvious the staff there cares for their animals and anyone who is there visiting.
Will visit again.< /Text>< rate>

It is a shelter. Their business is not one of the greatest, they have to do what they have to do. But when we adopted our dog from here, the staff was very nice. Very welcoming. Very knowledgeable. We visited various times. On the last time they allowed us to bring our other dog to visit our future dog. To see their interaction. Very nice and smooth process.<//text>

<review>The 2 representatives behind the computer were gentle when I brought a dog which I found crossing the streets near the highway but there was an "official" who started asking me silly questions like the age of the dog, the weight of the dog, and that because I had a piece of chain and what exactly was on the streets and if I did not ask the neighbors ...?, it is not the first time I save animals from being run over and that I call to control animals or that I take them personally and the truth On this occasion, I am upset and frustrated by the official saying that I really should be on the streets doing their job and leaving the staff who have the attitude of service...

They asked me for my identification, address, telephone number and they questioned me as if I had committed a crime in saving the puppy, that is why the citizenship no longer wants to help the institutions...< /review>< pictures>

<review>Ok. I adopted a kitten almost 2months old, 65$. He had a little bot fly and they took it out cleaned and fixed the kitten up, the guy that works with the kittens explained everything well. I did take our kitten to the vet today and he's good! Healthy kitten strong heart, super duper loving! His name was Marcus at the shelter but my son keeps changing his name haha I think we decided on bowzer.
Kittens neutered area is healing very well and our vet said the vet the animal shelter works with did a great job on neutering!
I felt the need to give a good rating due to all this positive news and great outcome with our kitten!

The staff at devore animal shelter is great, super friendly and kind hearted.
Thank you guys so much! If we ever look into adopting more animals we will come to you, I will referr friends and family to your shelter also. Thank you so much!
I just called to follow up on his chip information changing to our info also and they reminded me it'll happen soon and I will get our papers in the mail :) were so happy, thank you for taking care of our forever kitty <3</review><UserId.>108516690195414438690< /UserId.><Name>Z s<//Name>< rating>

Thank you for your assistance today.  We were able to reunite a lost doggy with her owner.  What a wonderful experience.  Devore Shelter helped us tremendously by placing her on A found list and contacted Rialto Animal Control to notify them just in case they were called.

Thank you again for your professional performance in public service:  God bless.< /Text>

Six dogs have until tonight and tomorrow to be adopted or rescued or they will be euthanized at Devore Animal Shelter. The shelter is over flowing with 30-40 animals a day. CAN PEOPLE PLEASE STOP DUMPING YOUR ANIMALS TO A HIGH KILL SHELTER? Is it possible to find them a home your self or even drop them off to a NO KILL SHELTER? What is your problem people?

Here are the ID numbers if anybody wants to know.

ID# A528050 I am a male, brown brindle and white Pit Bull Terrier mix.
ID# A528179 I am a NEUTERED male, brown and white Chihuahua - Smooth Coated.
ID# A528064 I am a male, brown and white Pit Bull Terrier.
ID# A528287 I am a female, tan and white Pit Bull Terrier.
ID# A528055 I am a neutered male, gray and white Pit Bull Terrier.
ID# A527966 I am a male, tan Chihuahua - Smooth Coated.</review>

<Text>Rescued a really sweet , loving K9 from here .clean facility with friendly staff. However I had to pickoff 8 large engorged deer ticks off this poor guy for two days . The staff is walking the dogs in the local fields and not checking for ticks . Also I was charged a nueter few even though he was already nuetered . That's double dipping. Not cool people. I was just trying to rescue this poor guy and you riipped me off and I had to deal with the stress of the ticks .< /Text><name>mike contractor< /name>< Rate>

There isnt enough lines to tell you how professional clean and outstanding  this shelter  is it feel more like an adoption center then a shelter  the staff are very friendly  and very caring and lovable they want great homes for there fur babies and they want all parties  to be happy and get the perfect  fur baby right for them If more than one person wants the same animal its not first come first serve  theres a raffle  and u all get  to raffle higher  number is the excitable  winner it's fun and exciting  and make u nervous  not knowing  if u get the fur baby u want if u dont win the raffle u still have lots of fur baby  to choose  from I mean the whole point is to get them a home so that is some animal  u can find and love and there always animals being  brought  in so be patient  open ur heart and give a furry a loving home.
Important (once u adopt you fur goes to the vet then u pick up ur baby from there ) they open at 10am walk in welcomed</review>

Came in to look around for a dog. However I left rather quickly because the ladies at the front desk were pretty rude I told them I was scouting ahead for my family wife and kids waiting in car and she waited till I went around the corner to throw out a smart remark and when I tuned around they just stayed quiet... I don't expect you nor do I want you to treat me all high and mighty just basic customer/human service but you couldn't even accomplish that...I was going to turn around and say something but thought she's not worth it. To top it off the animals are so depressed here and I can't blame them if I had to hang around sad people like them.. I'll go to another shelter from now on.</Text>

<user_name>Jim Ixtian<//user_name><time>1450995428603</time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>Yes, this is a high kill shelter, but when I went to look for a dog to adopt everyone was very friendly and helpful. In fact, it was remarkably easy to adopt. Keep in mind, not all dogs will be available as some will be held until their owners claim them. If not, after that time period  with no response they'll be available for adoption.

As for the staff, really nice and helpful. They made adopting my dog really easy, then he was off to a local vet clinic to get fixed. All for a a fair expense. The only negative thing about the shelter is that it really is remote off the I-215. You'll have to meander your way to the shelter but thankfully there are blue signs pointing the way to the shelter. Also, be warned that some of the animal rescue groups regularly go through these shelters so act quickly if you want to adopt an animal.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

This place is a hell-hole for animals. They have no right to call themselves a "shelter". The animals they "rescue" have a better chance of surviving out in the streets. Criminals!<//Text>

It was like 103° out and the dogs were in outside kennels. I think that is ridiculous. Lets put a fur coat on you guys and stick you in a cage to swelter! Havent these poor pups been through enough? Prices to adopt a dog....$200! Thats a little much. Lower your prices and maybe more dogs will have a chance to live.<//Text>

I went to take a look at a horse here and the woman who took me back informed me that none of the animals they take in see a veterinarian unless it seems to have an issue.. when I was waiting for the officer to take us to the horse, a man was bringing back a dog that he had adopted few days ago because he took him to a vet who said the dog had an UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION! Please, do not adopt an animal from this shelter unless you have experience in the Veterinary medical field and know what you are looking for!< /Text>

I drove 3 hours out of my way, straight from work and arrived at ten to 5 pm only to find that the dog, Wayne, I had asked for had just been picked up by a rescue center a half hour before I arrived (according to staff).  They told me they called the rescue center and gave them my phone number, but I never heard back from the rescue center.  Supposedly the center was located in my home town of Thousand Oaks (again according to staff).  I am unable to find the dog at any rescue in Thousand Oaks.  I took a small female chi mix instead because I couldn't leave without at least saving one dog after seeing that place.  She held onto me with all her might and threw up twice in my car on the four hour trip home.  She was terrified.  I took her to my vet this morning because she was having trouble urinating.  She has a bladder infection due to being spayed without antibiotics (or pain killer afterward).  The dogs at this place were moaning and crying.  I don't hear that when I visit Agoura Animal Shelter.  The temperature is sweltering hot.  It is surrounded by open desert.  The facility is two feet from the rail road tracks in the middle of no where.  It shakes every time a train passes.  Management refuses to take phone numbers or names and call people who say they are on their way to pick up a dog.  This place is "first come, first serve" according to them.  Direct quote.  I agree that this place should be shut down, moved and placed under different management.<//Review>

I adopted a female pitbull at devore and she is one of the best dogs ever. The ladies at the front desk are very helpful and compassionate towards the animals, they try their best to help all the animals get out of the shelter and into a good home.< /review>

Went to pick up a dog and found out that dog was adopted by the public
5 minutes before I arrived. The rescue coordinator and staff were
friendly and helpful and alerted me to another dog that I was able to
network and got the dog adopted.<//text>

It's a small shelter. They are friendly and professional. I lost my cat name Ben. I fill out some paper work and left behind a picture of my cat in a folder they have. I never found him. It was really nice that  they care to try to help me  find him. The san Bernardino  shelter and cat rescue group both did tell me that the devore shelter kills strays and kittens on the same day they are drop off.  I live you with that.</review>

<Text>Just recently mine and my fiancées dog (that was given to us by his late brother) got put in here. When we found out where our baby was we immediately came down here. We told the lady in the front that we couldn't afford the payment in whole that we would need a little time. Unbeknownst to us they euthanized our beloved baby. They have no empathy or care when it comes to animals! Their excuse, was that he was antsy. Complete lies told on their end. I recommended anyone to steer clear of these heartless, money hungry, animal killing jerks here!< /Text>< pictures>

Animals are euthanized here daily and there are so many! They claim to be a shelter and "rescue" animals, but these terrified or ill creatures are killed for space. Please adopt one of their animals today, not to support them but keep the animal from being killed (especially high risk ones like the seniors, sick, injured, scared (labeled "aggressive" is often very wrong), etc.<//Text>

Drove over to look at a dog they had posted online, when I got there all the gates were locked, the website says they are open until 5 on Saturdays. No one was answering the phones so we called their emergency line and said no one would be there until Monday, with no other explanation.</review>

My experience at Devore Animal Shelter was beyond EXCELLENT! I can't even express how nice the staff and managers are at Devore Animal Shelter. I picked up a stray dog on the street one day and knew I had to find a home for him or take him to the shelter. After reading the reviews about this place, I had decided that this was not a good place to take my dog. When I realized I had to take my dog to the closest shelter from where I found him, i was scared because I knew this was the closest place When I took him took Devore, I was proven 100% wrong. I was shown the entire facility and I believe with every ounce in my body that the dog would be treated with love tenderness, love, and care. the facility is very clean and DOES NOT ,in any way, look institutional. I have only four dogs in my house, they have 50+ animals, and their shelter is cleaner that my own house!!!! I ABSOLUTELY reccommend this Animal Shelter to anyone who has a stray they can't keep or is looking to adopt a pet!!!!!!!<//review>

I figured considering its size it wouldnt be hard for me to get into a new place and wouldnt get kicked out of my current one. However. The vet that neutered him told me he was only 5 months old. Now im worried ill get kicked out of my place considering he is at the weight limit. The dogs here however dont apear to be abused and seem to be well fed and taken care of and if you adopt a dog they apear to microchip it for free which is nice.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Fees are astronomically expensive, but must be paid in a short period of time to retrieve your pet. A stick up or Highway robbery at its best. I was charged for vaccinations before she even got off the truck, she contracted kennel cough & came home with hitchhikers - ticks. PLEASE WATCH YOUR PETS ! !

How do I dislike the negative  reviews. This area is high kill because residents dont nueter or spay their pets and let them breed then abandom them when the pet cost actual money.

So let's talk about the quality of people who go here. It's the same people who can't afford their pet once they need something more than dog food and let them loose to the streets. I adopted my sweet Staffie from here. Phenomenal. This shelter held him for me while I prepared my home,  helped explain the breed of the dog and allowed me to spend time with him before. They partner with Pet Smart to help with upfront costs and I still talk to the workers here.

What I did see were trash families who tried to take animals out of cages when workers weren't looking and are probably the ones complaining because they got caught or were denied ownership over these pets.  HIGH KILL SHELTERS take up with your city council NOT THE WORKERS.

FYI these shelters run off donations. Help them and quit judging looking for likes on social media.<//Text>

They have the biggest rendering contract where they get paid more for dead animals vs adopted so they are more interested to kill them then see them out. (The dead animals are being processed into cheap dog food!) Everyone dies, they don't pick and choose, puppies die every! Every day the shelter has up to 20 dogs on Euthanisia list and they have fun doing that too, they get good laughs torturing and killing scared animlas begging and pleeing for mercy and their lives! They get a kick out of it!  Shelter employees (Managers) are the Worst animal abusers and they have to be jailed. Animal abuse and cruelty applies to Everyone! They kill animals even knowing Rescue groups are coming for them! Sometimes they will order to kill while a Rescue is in the lobby trying to save them. They DO NOT work with rescue groups, they find Any reason not to save an animal but to MURDER them instead! this shelter is ran by CRIMINALS who sooner or later will be put behind bars for Millions of BUTCHERED lives! If you are looking to adopt, you can really save a life there or take a dog to foster!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1362110987977< /Time><review>A few days ago, my children and I were on our way home in Rialto. We came across a dirty, white poodle casually walking in the street, oblivious to the cars around it. Being an animal lover, I had do do something. We pulled over, called out to the dog and he immediately ran over to us and jumped in the car. This dog had no collar on. On the drive home, I knew my husband was not going to be happy since we already had 4 dogs, two cats, 5 birds and a rabbit in our home. As much as we are a family of animal lovers, we simply did not have room in our home for another dog.

After a bit of research, I learned that I needed to take the dog to the Devore Animal Shelter, as this particular shelter services my neighborhood. I read the online reviews and the picture  created in my mind was that of a "dog concentration camp." Without much time and without any other options, I decided to take the dog there and see what the facility was like. If it was in fact, a horrible place, I was going to keep the dog, take care of him and try to locate his owner. If that was not possible, I was going to find a good home for him myself.

When we arrived at the facility, my daughter and I went in and explained the story behind the dog. I mentioned that my daughter was upset at having to leave him there. (she had also read the online reviews). The manager, Doug, offered to give us a tour of the facility, which he did. He took us all around the entire property and explained step by step what happens to the animals on the premises and how they are cared for. We saw the cat rooms, the aggressive dog area, the small dog area, the large dog area and the outside pens for the large farm animals. Doug explained in detail the engineering behind the kennels and how all areas are temperature controlled so the animals remained comfortable, regardless of the weather.

We toured the entire facility and saw approximately 50 cats and probably 75-100 dogs. The inside facility and outside grounds were very clean. I was quite impressed. After walking through the entire facility, I didn't see nor did I smell one dog turd. It certainly didn't smell like a rose garden, but it was a very clean and well-kept facility. All the animals I saw appeared to be well fed and well cared for. Doug was kind enough to spend about 45 minutes with us, explaining all the various aspects of the facility.

Many of the other posts talk about the "kill rate" of the shelter. While this certainly is a very unpleasant thought, it is a fact of life. Every day, healthy animals are euthanized because there are simply not enough homes for them. If every pet owner were responsible and made sure their animal was not allowed to reproduce indiscriminately, if every pet owner made sure their pets were properly chipped and tagged, if people did not dump unwanted pets out into the street for others to deal with, then there would be no need for animal shelters. The fact is, overpopulation exists and must be dealt with in the best way possible. After touring the facility, I felt quite comfortable leaving the stray dog there. While we were there, he was immediately photographed to be put on the website and had his health evaluated by a technician. I pray for this dog and hope he is either found by his owner or adopted by a loving family. If anyone is interested, he is a  white, male, poodle type dog with light brown patches on his back. Approximately 6-7 years old. He was very sweet, quiet and lovable. He was in my house for 4 days. He did not mess in the floor once and he got along quite well with my other 4 dogs. He was left at the shelter on 2/28/13.

After my first hand experience at this shelter, I would advise anyone looking for a pet to consider visiting a shelter first. There were so many beautiful animals waiting to be adopted. Big dogs. little dogs, poodles, and puppies. There was something for everyone. I had a very positive experience at the Devore Animal Shelter and I recommend it highly.<//review>< response>

This is a high kill pound that kills on demand.  In other words, it will kill an animal if the owner wants the animal killed.  NO animal shelter does that anymore unless the shelter is a complete dump.<//text>

Horrible Costumer Service!!!

I was so disappointed in the costumer service. I recently found a dog on the street and took him in. I called Devore Animal Shelter trying to find a non-kill place and the lady talker/treated me like I was 5. I felt so belittle, these people are suppose to help you and not make you feel like your a waste of time. Thank god I didn't take that dog there, I wouldn't have trusted it.<//text>

<Text>Here's a real review from a real person...

My 12 year old black lab was staying with my ex because I am in an apartment and she is too large.  On New Years Eve, she got spooked by fireworks and jumped the fence.  Her tag and license fell off somewhere in the night, probably loose from the fence when she jumped.  Someone in the neighborhood found her and called Animal Control.  My ex texted me to let me know she was in Devore.

So, today I go to pick up my dog.  She's there and in good spirits when she sees me.  First, they try to say she's not mine because someone else called to claim her.  I had to show multiple photos on my phone to prove it.  This I understand.  Then they ask, has she been fixed?  I state yes.  I adopted her from the Hesperia Animal Shelter where they require shots and neutering for pets.  Is she licensed?  I state yes but her tags are missing.  They ask if I have proof which I do not, except the fact that she was adopted from a shelter that required it and I lived in County area for the licensing.  They claim that without proof, I have to pay $169 to get her out.  They don't have records on her because them and Hesperia only go back 10 years or so.

Then, they would not even allow me to see my dog without paying the fees!  Seriously!  I cannot afford to pay $169 to get her because I can't prove she's fixed.  Instead of letting me have my dog, they are going to keep her and, in a few weeks, because of her health and age, they will probably put her down,

Seriously, this is a messed up place.  I would not recommend this place to anyone for any reason.  Go to YAPS or San Bernardino Animal Shelter.  And God forbid your dog gets out.< /Text>< Pictures>

Not my experince but why on earth are you letting families bring in a elderly dog and letting  them replace it with a young pup. These people dont deserve a pet. And shame on you for allowing it to happen</Review>

They're putting fearful (not feral) felines on the kill list. Lately we've helped to rescue and place a few dozen animals. More often than not, they learn to trust within a short period of time. Who is in charge of this charade?< /text>

<Text>Very loud ride...I mean LOUD! I rode in the front, far right seat and experienced a grey out twice (nearly passed out...was quite an experience)! I know that my review sounds negative but I assure you that it is not, as this ride was INTENSE! There is no pretty scenery to view on this ride, which is unusual for Magic Mountain...but it is still worth riding at least once. I have been told that each ride experience is different, I will not ride again to know...but I am glad that I rode it once and that I was in the front to do so.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This thing is fast as hell. Very enjoyable, but the airhorns are loud and the lines tend to be long. The queue music is nice though.< /Review>

This is a really great ride for the beginner to moderate Rider. It is a super safe floorless roller coaster and it has all of the features that you would want when you are writing you don't get tossed around like some rides it is still a smooth ride and highly recommended.</review>

<Review>Scream is a great floor-less B&M  coaster. The ride is fast, features some fantastic inversion, and will make you, well, scream. The ride is at the back of the park on a dead end so the wait is usually short and the operations are fast. Definitely ride if you can.< /Review><Rating>4< /Rating><Time>1516222139042< /Time>< UserId.>

Not the best roller coaster but a decent one relatively to the others in the theme park. The seats can be uncomfortable at times. I would suggest riding at the back for the smoothest ride.<//text>

Nice layout, but it just sits on a parking lot.  Kinda sad, really.

The ride itself is a solid looping coaster.  Strong loops delivered with decent smoothness.< /Text>

It's a typical regaulr coastsr.nothing too special but it kinda gives off the early 2000s vibe when six flags felt more like six flags. It's cool that they play sandstorm while you wait in line. Just adding to the early 2000s vibe of the ride. The new paint job kinda killed it tho. And also removing the photo also is killing it but overall just a decent coaster</Text>

This is an great ride. It has awesome inversions and great forces and air time. But the theme is the WORST. What even is this ride about? Twisted Colossus is steam-punk. Full Throttle is YOLO. I think they should make the theme Bizzaro, like they did at Six Flags Great Adventure, which is the same track. Overall it's a fun ride, but it lacks a theme.

Reliable but nothing extremely memorable.  That's both good and bad, nothing great but also no annoyances.  It's a good alternative if Goliath is backed up.</text>

Favorite Roller Coaster between them all. It requires a bit more guts than the others. Not for the weak hearted.. It's floor less with a bit more spinning and turning.< /review>

This coaster is a blast, and may just be my favorite one in the entire park.  The wait for this ride is also usually pretty short, and allows you to get your coaster fix sated pretty quickly.< /text>

Not a huge fan. Rough and actually gets boring.  Just keeps looping. Also it's really loud.</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Not the best roller coasters. Looks spectacular, but is quite harmless.

<rating>5</rating><Text>I love Reddingwood mobile home and RV park!!! The management here has always been 100% awesome in there service to the community here. They took over the park a few years ago and have done an awesome job at cleaning it over the years and making it a happy welcoming place for families. I've lived here in the park for 3 years and have never had any issues with the company running it or the on-site managers. Our onsite manager is constantly out in the park working on improvements and helping the older residents. We have a very happy little community here and most of the residents are like family and help each other out whenever they can! My growing family is very happy we're here in this community!!!!</Text>< pics>

Great place for a family to start out of grow into. I've lived here for almost two years and I have two little ones and another on the way. It is a very calm and friendly place. And the park pushes to keep a clean and safe park for family's they are very helpful too.< /review>

Reddingwood mobile home park has a great family orientated environment yeah their maybe one or two things that need to be polished up but overall I feel like this mobile home park is a great community to be a part of and I'm most definitely glad that we do have a kind heart'd lady like Rose that is the head of our community here at Reddingwood. Keep up the great work and please always stay sincere.</text>

< Review>
Healthier ramen kind of place. I never did eat anything but a spoonful of broth. Flavor not deep or rich enough, but I do know the sourcing of the food is on point.

I was a fan of the food, and I may just set up a summertime routine of lunch here, and Bay Bridge hike afterward. Great plan for great weather days!!

Their free iced green tea is made with matcha; I like!</Review>

The Food
I discovered this interesting place when ramen was the decision for lunch. They have this concept of broffee, which is ramen broth in a coffee cup. We ordered their Gyukotsu and Miso ramen along with their Pasture Raised Pork Bone Broth. Because this is Yuzu Ramen, we had to order the Yuzu Creme Brulee to finish off. The Gyukotsu came with ground beef, red onions, green beans, renkon (lotus root), and soft boiled egg. The miso had chashu, kikurage, green onions, sliced lemon, soft boiled egg, and chili pepper. Both ramen had the more traditional style noodle, and both were not bad. Though the taste of the broth is on the lighter side so it might be lacking in flavor for some. For me, I do enjoy the lighter broth. Though I do wish they give more meat for the Gyukotsu, it was a bit lacking. The Pasture Raised Pork Bone Broth or broffee was good, an interesting side addition to the meal. Last but not least, the Yuzu Creme Brulee was delicious, with a nice yuzu taste to it.

The Miscellaneous
Yuzu Ramen is a decent sized restaurant, for a ramen that is. The restaurant is in an L shape configuration, which is interesting. They have normal seating as well as bar style seating. I was trying to make a reservation but there weren't any available, so I was expecting long lines. But it wasn't super crowded and seating is first come first serve after ordering. The service was good, and the employees were sincere. The restaurant advertises their ingredients as organic with no additives or preservatives. They have a variety of categories on their menu, each with a few selections. There's also special timed items like their donburi for lunch and sushi for dinner. The prices are higher than the typical ramen places around the bay. But their menu is interesting, so I'll probably return to try some of the other selections.< /text>

<Review>Purchased the veggie (vegan when they remove the egg) Ramen which tastes good. Extremely disappointed with the portion size of protein provided here for the price. Tofu is easily the cheapest of the any of the protein options a restaurant can offer and yet I found a measly four small pieces of tofu in my ramen container. Also given the fact that they vegan-ize this by simply removing the egg, you'd expect a substitution with more tofu or Edamame. I hope Yuzu changes there approach here. I can't recommend this place given the cost and the portion sizes for protien at the current moment.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIOGHC3M95_gOn9eBt-tTpkfiUhEPRlX8i6kIO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80857e5e548f2433:0xb888ad48636a67a4</gmapID></record>

I dream of this spot. They are worth the nearly 3 hour round trip drive. I don't think anyone ramen spot's broth has given me dreams like this place. OMG the broth, so hot, so flavorful, so yummy. The chashu nearly melts in your mouth-- so thinly sliced. I only wished the ramen had veggies in it :). It was an odd fluke of events that lead me to find this spot, as I normally go to SJ for ramen, due to living in SC.<//text>

<text>Pros: Had the tonkatsu ramen for lunch. Broth was very rich and tasty. Noodles were nicely cooked. Portion size was ok.

Cons:  The char sui was ~ 95% FAT. The menu did state this was going to be pork belly. But I am used to having some meat mixed with the fat. Was very disappointed. The person taking orders was more interested in shutting down at 2pm than tending to the customers.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
The Food
I discovered this interesting place when ramen was the decision for lunch. They have this concept of broffee, which is ramen broth in a coffee cup. We ordered their Gyukotsu and Miso ramen along with their Pasture Raised Pork Bone Broth. Because this is Yuzu Ramen, we had to order the Yuzu Creme Brulee to finish off. The Gyukotsu came with ground beef, red onions, green beans, renkon (lotus root), and soft boiled egg. The miso had chashu, kikurage, green onions, sliced lemon, soft boiled egg, and chili pepper. Both ramen had the more traditional style noodle, and both were not bad. Though the taste of the broth is on the lighter side so it might be lacking in flavor for some. For me, I do enjoy the lighter broth. Though I do wish they give more meat for the Gyukotsu, it was a bit lacking. The Pasture Raised Pork Bone Broth or broffee was good, an interesting side addition to the meal. Last but not least, the Yuzu Creme Brulee was delicious, with a nice yuzu taste to it.

The Miscellaneous
Yuzu Ramen is a decent sized restaurant, for a ramen that is. The restaurant is in an L shape configuration, which is interesting. They have normal seating as well as bar style seating. I was trying to make a reservation but there weren't any available, so I was expecting long lines. But it wasn't super crowded and seating is first come first serve after ordering. The service was good, and the employees were sincere. The restaurant advertises their ingredients as organic with no additives or preservatives. They have a variety of categories on their menu, each with a few selections. There's also special timed items like their donburi for lunch and sushi for dinner. The prices are higher than the typical ramen places around the bay. But their menu is interesting, so I'll probably return to try some of the other selections.<//Review>

Pros: Had the tonkatsu ramen for lunch. Broth was very rich and tasty. Noodles were nicely cooked. Portion size was ok.

Cons:  The char sui was ~ 95% FAT. The menu did state this was going to be pork belly. But I am used to having some meat mixed with the fat. Was very disappointed. The person taking orders was more interested in shutting down at 2pm than tending to the customers.</review>

Great! Traditional Japanese ramen, exactly like you'll find in mum and pop shops in Tokyo. Friendly, attentive service as you'd expect. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for :)

Highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates real ramen.</Review>

Very friendly service. Waitress was really nice. Food took a little while but the broth is very nice. They don't use MSG or excessive seasoning so the broth doesn't leave you feeling thirsty. Would recommend.</review>

I've been to this place a number of times. Don't get me wrong, the ramen is very good (hearty, high quality and contains a number of ingredients), but the past few times I've been there I've noticed a decline in quality (broth seems watered down, portions smaller, etc). Unfortunately, if I'm paying 15 dollars for a bowl of ramen, I can't accept anything buy high quality.

The menu and servers have changed multiple times in two years, which suggests ownership has changed as well. Maybe this is the reason the food has declined. I don't know. All I can say is this place was a great place for us to go for a while, but I feel like it is on  a downward trend. Prove me wrong Yuzu!< /review>

<Text>The broth was great, really good. For here in Berkeley area it's pretty good. The noddles were different from what I'm used to and the portion was on the small size for me. Price wise a pretty pricey for the portion you get, but that's cause of the grass-fed, organic, "high end" ingredients they use.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<text>Great service and solid ramen. Portions are modest, but quality is excellent. Kids meals are available and are an exceptional value, especially given the ingredients - no processed nuggets to be found. Also, you can bring your dog and sit in the outdoor area! Blankets are provided if necessary. Very pleasant experience.< /text>< pictures>

Honestly...I live directly across the street and both me and my date felt sick afterwards! The food itself tasted relatively good, nothing to rave about, but it’s the fact that BOTH of us felt sick afterwards that concerns me.< /Text>

This place makes fantastic ramen. Beef, pork or pork miso. They have awesome gluten free noodles too and a nice patio out back. I’d definitely do 5 stars but the service is quick service. I can’t fault them for doing that but it means you have to line up if you need a new drink or something else to eat. Definitely 5 star food though!< /Review>

This place serves ramen with bone broth, a bit viscous and opaque. The flavor is mild and unique. Kids may not like it. Mine did not. They also have chicken wings here that are cooked very nicely. I have tried 2 spicy versions and they were good, different and probably authentic. Recommended.< /text>

What can I say about this place? Open kitchen, clean and spacious environment, decent prices for a bowl of delicately brewed ramen. Services are on point, employees are very well trained. Gotta love the jazz music!<//Review>

Great place for a bowl of delicious ramen or udon. Staff is friendly and very helpful. A nice selection of beer. I love their wings, too.

I saw a comment from someone else about being pushed or forced out to pay when she was less than half way finished with their food...you pay before you sit down and then wait for your food...so I think that person may have mistaken their experience with this nice establishment.</review>

<Text>Went here for the first time this past weekend and loved it. I like that they have a child's portion for $4! The broth is delicious. They offer $3 glass of red organic wine. I'll be coming back to try other flavors and will opt for the additional veggies.

Came back on 3/24/2017 and the service was so slow.... Sat around for like 30 minutes before getting check to pay. Not good when you have a toddler itching to leave.</Text>< UserId.>

Waaay too noisy making the atmosphere pretty unpleasant. Thin noodles were cooked to perfection but the tonkotsu broth was pretty standard and unremarkable. Pork was tasty and the egg was cooked well - just slightly set. Portion size was adequate. Very friendly service.</Review>

<Text>Random ramen spot in Emeryville yay!

Decent ramen, especially in the middle of nowhere in Emeryville. The place isn't packed for our lunch on Sunday morning. Thought that I needed to make a reservation before coming, but it's not necessary at all.

They have some beer with CBD selections :O. Definitely wanna try that in the future!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

it's good but not worth the price.  I asked to switch broth to vegetarian and keep everything else as pork broth, and they said "no" to that.  I don't know how hard it is do just switch broth...<//text>

Great broths and noodles. Their tonkatsu is textbook perfect. Even their veggie curry broth is great. They have three styles of noodles, each used for specific broths. The thicker ones have a good chew for my taste, especially the "thick & wavy" variety.

Bonus points for having a kid's meal.

This place is on the pricey side for ramen, but is well worth it.<//review>

<text>Its to bad they were quick to run me off when I stayed to taste my to go order on my first time there. Id understand if there was a line out the door, but it was dead in there. They should have just let me finish and if i liked it i would have ordered more. Instead they had to be rude and impatient. Thats not good service. Now I'll never go back and I live right around the corner. Stupid fools think that rules are more important. I will never recommend them to anyone and in fact will direct my friends to nicer people.< /text>< Pics>

Get the spicy vegan ramen (not too salty, well-balanced and flavorful) and ginger tea (not too sweet, great flavor). Soooo good! Great ambiance, both inside, but especially on the outdoor patio in the back.< /Review>

Stopped in on a Sunday night and had a pleasant experience. We had to wait quite awhile for an inside table since they only had one working heat lamp for outside, but once we got some food headed our way things got much better.

Started off with their wings and got a few of their local selection of beer and cider. The wings were fantastic, I would come back just for these. Get the big order, you will want more.

Then we had both the pork and beef Raman dishes. My girlfriend loved the pork and I thought my beef dish had some of the best flavor in Raman I think I've ever had. Exceptional. You will want another egg since they only put half of one in there, so order an extra.</text>

The Ramen 🍜 is good, but the prices are pretty steep. When you walk out and realize that with tax and tip you just paid $20 bucks for a bowl of soup... Yikes! It's just a little overpriced for what it is.</review>

The food is amazing. I've had both the pork and beef broths which were great, and the tekadon was tasty. The only thing that brings it down is the service which can be a bit slow.< /review>

The service here borders on an olympian level of incompetence. I've been here a dozen times and on the *best* day and the service is mediocre. Common issues will range from inability to be seated (when most of the tables are empty), not being given utensils, not receiving drink orders, having to repeatedly ask for water, etc. Even the take out service is sub-optimal.

As a dish, the food is fine. This is one of many establishments hot on the bone broth kick so expect the have that angle layed on pretty thick.<//Text>

Tasty noodle soup, crispy crunchy chicken wings, and the matcha brulee was super yummy. Service was very fast and friendly. In fact no less than three or four different servers came by to try and take our order, but we just had not had more than a couple minutes to review the menu. When we were finishing up they tried to bring our check even though we had intended to order dessert. So super fast but maybe not the best service. There were three of us in our party and we ordered two desserts to share but both times they brought the dish, they only brought two utensils. Again, fast service but not the best.<//Text>

<Text>Used to be my favorite. I live half a block away and when this place popped up, my family and I were thrilled. The first 3 or 4 times we went , we got GREAT service, Amazing food and saw the owner (dressed as waitstaff) often. Very humble guy with a eye for good service.

Last night 9/7/17, the Family and I walked in for the 1 year anniversary around 7:45pm. As we walked in, we were greeted as usual. Sat down at our table and ordered the same thing we always get. My Wife and Daughter got the Spicy Miso. I got the Gyukotsu or beef bone broth with no mustard or egg, mushrooms on the side and gluten free noodles.  I like most mushroom but they are like wine and I don't like them all.

Since I was removing a protein (egg)  and asked if I could possibly get more asparagus, the waitress (who I later found out was the floor manager) said she would ask the kitchen, AND NEVER CAME BACK. Honestly I did not think twice about it. I have never been disappointed with this place so I dismissed it as all is well and moved on.

Excited as I always am with this place, I was truly disappointed when my meal arrived. It came first with 7 sliced of mushroom, 1/2 of a stalk of asparagus and what I found out seconds later chewy tasteless meat. We just kind of stared at the bowl. I asked is half a stack of asparagus (a whole stalk that someone actually took the time to slice in half length wise) was the new normal and I was told by waitstaff "it is just a garnish". It is the ONLY vegetable in the entire dish. And as a point of reference this was never the case before. As most cooks know, asparagus has to be broken at this natural point or you get this hard ,chewy and stringy portion which is unpleasant. That was not done so 1/3 of my half asparagus was a loss.

After the check was paid for, which took 15 - 20 minutes to get and then get back, I asked to speak with the manager. The young lady came and I explained the situation she was like "Oh I'm sorry to hear that, let me go talk with the kitchen manager" and walked off. We sat there for about 5-10 minutes and was just out done. We left and made the decision to never come back.

I come from the food industry and have even had the experience of having my life taken over by a restaurant as the General Manager. Tasting food and working with small business is what I do daily now but inconsistent quality of food or service has me in damage control with my clients. I honestly may be more sensitive to it but i just want good food all the time since the price is the same all the time.

In the end, the broth was the same Amazing experience but with no vegetables, lowered quality of meat, and a inattentive waitstaff , I can drive a little further and get the food I expect from Noodle Theory or The Ramen Shop.<//Text>< Pics>

Eh. It was okay. I'm glad I went, since it wasn't crowed and the staff was very friendly, but the food was a bit on the salty side and the portions were small. Not sure I'll go back though.</text>

<text>The kids meals particularly (what I’m focusing on mainly) was really good I appreciate how the chef paid attention to the kids food too although I noticied they changed the soup in the adults meal to make it more creamy but the kids meal lacked that touch. But overall my meal was pleasing including: small tonkatsu ramen (with no egg), salad, a juice box, and a ginger fritter.

Broth is like none other. Super thick and comforting. Pork > Beef broth.

Had the spicy chicken wings, not that exciting. Jus seemed like they spilled a bunch of chili pepper packets from a delivery pizza place on them.

Fried rice was ok.</text>

< Review>
Update November 2019:
Service has gone way downhill which is really saying something considering service in the Bay Area is generally pretty poor. But yeah, no need to be standoffish. Also, vegetarian offering is really poor. "No substitutions" seems to be the new mantra.  Also, it's now $16 for a bowl of ramen. If the rent is too high, move somewhere else. But if you need to have those prices for a bowl of noodles, at least demand more of your wait staff. And, don't run out of anything that you carry on tap.

Instead of "give 'em a try", I'm changing the review to "avoid if possible". There are many better options in the area.

____________________________

Original review:
Atmosphere is meh, but ramen is solid.

Edit: I'm actually removing a star since they charge an extra $6 on a $15 ramen to order online. Are you kidding? Either take phone orders or get another service to send in the orders.</Review>

<Name>Brechin A< /Name><Text>So refreshing to find a relatively traditional ramen shop in my neighborhood. Absolutely in love with the broths and noodles. The whole experience is just absolutely perfect. Everything is delicious and richly flavored. Huge props for using grass fed or pasture raised organic meats and ingredients, it really makes a difference in overall flavor. I keep going back or more. The kid's meal is a bargain for a huge bowl of ramen, side salad, juice box, and a delicious little rice fritter (think of a deep fried risotto ball) dipped in honey gInger sauce. My only complaint is that the addictive side salad is only available with a kid's meal.</Text><rate>5<//rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

The broffee was fantastic. I don't eat carbs and my kids wanted ramen and this was the perfect solution. They loved their ramen. I also tried the poke salad but it was not very special. I'll stick with the spicy pork broffee. So tasty.< /text>

My first few visits here had been wonderful. My most recent visit may just be my last.

On Sept. 14th, my partner and I decided to stop in for our third dinner here. I ordered a tonkatsu udon and my partner the spicy miso ramen.

Here's a quick summary of everything I found to be wrong during our experience: my meal arrived five minutes after my partner's, had the wrong noodle, it took a while before I could flag anyone's attention, I was asked if I wanted it remade, when I replied yes I was told it would be around 10 minutes before they could get to my order (which came across like my order would be put last in line), my partner's broth had too much miso paste, and there was no correction on the bill for the waitress's mistake. The restaurant staff made no effort to check in whatsoever to see how our meal was.

Our experiences prior to this visit have been nothing short of great, but I think their growing popularity may have affected the quality of this establishment.</Text>

Best ramen in the bay. The broth and ingredients are all organic so you don't feel sluggish but satisfied.</Text>

I've been going here since they opened about a year-and-a-half ago I have to say my all-time favorite meal there is the tonkotsu ramen with extra chashu. They used to carry an Arnold Palmer which I would have with my meal they no longer carry that that makes me sad, what happened guys.<//text>

Underwhelming and expensive.

I had the vegetarian ramen. The broth was quite thick and lacked all of the umami-richness of their bone broths,  ending up more like a butternut squash soup than a ramen broth. The vegetable assortment in the ramen ranged from delightful (thin layers of squash and toasted lotus root) to unpleasant (fresh cherry tomatoes and a whole roasted okra too tough to bite through).

All in all, Shiba Ramen is only a few blocks away, less expensive and providing a better vegetarian experience.</Text>

I ate at Yuzu Ramen & Broffee for lunch a week after its opening.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen.  Overall, I am mixed about the ramen:

Pros:
- rich broth
- fresh noodles
- delicious chashu (braised pork belly)
- perfectly cooked egg

Cons:
- broth flavors were muted.  it was almost too rich, such that you couldn't pick out any particular flavors.  you could tell there was a lot going on, but nothing in particular stood out.  in the end, i'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  i did like it enough to finish the whole thing, something i don't normally do with other ramen broths given their saltiness.
- small portion
- expensive ($14)... wouldn't be too bad if the portion was bigger.

The service was fast (even though I was told it would take 45 minutes, it only took about 10) and friendly.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating area is great on a sunny day.

I think the place has a lot of potential, but it is expensive for what you get.  If you're looking for super flavorful (i.e., spicy and salty) ramen, this might not be it.  However, the ramen here is satisfying, so much so that I drank up all of the broth.  I guess that is their "broffee".</review>

< review>
This is a really great ramen place.  The broth choices are all good. There's three of them. They have signs up in the restaurant talking about the health benefits of bone broth. I can't speak to that but I might do some research on it. I had the beef broth with thinly sliced beef, asparagus and ramen noodles. The other broths come with different noodles one of them is wide and wavy. The ramen noodles I had were the traditional long wavy skinny noodles. I also tried the mini poke don and it was excellent. Everything comes with these wonderfully soft boiled eggs cut in half. The egg on the Pokemon was cold and it warmed up in the broth when it came served with the ramen. The service was slow and unimpressive. But that's kind of to be expected for a brand new place I think. They made up for it in enthusiasm and quality. I would definitely go back. I want to try the other things on their menu. They have a nice selection of beer and sake. I can't speak to the wine because I didn't have any wine. One really cool thing about this place is that you can get everything ala carte. Meaning that you can have just the broth or you can add whatever you want to the broth. The menu is really really flexible especially for folks who may have different dietary restraints or requirements or desires.</review>

The tonkotsu ramen is very good, has some of the best broth I've ever had. I would highly recommend giving it a try.

The other ramen flavors are alright but not as memorable. The yaki-meshi is similar to fried rice and is quite good, but it is definitely a side and not an entree in itself.

Although relatively expensive, still worth it for the higher quality ramen experience.< /text>

Noodles were undercooked and they bunched together in the bowl. My wife ordered the veggie ramen and all she got was soup and a few pieces of vegetables (1 or 2 pieces of vegetables listed on the menu for the dish).
Worst Ramen experience for me.< /Review>

<date>1558741176810</date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Home-made noodles with a good texture are often associated with the soup and have a good texture. The soup is well balanced and almost perfect as Japanese ramen. Fried rice is also good to be pampered.

(Translated by Google) The beef broth base ramen was delicious. The soup was cool and the meat on top was very delicious. I had beans and fried chicken as an appetizer and neither was bad. I recommend

소고기 육수 베이스의 라멘 맛있었어요. 국물이 시원했고 위에 올라간 고기가 참 맛있었네요. 에피타이저로 콩과 닭튀김을 먹었는데 둘 다 나쁘지 않았습니다. 추천해요~</text>

< Review>
I had a LARGE make out room margarita. The bartender told me they mean "business" with these huge puppies; the only thing is that I'm certain my blood alcohol wasn't affected at all by this monster mix. The venue is cool and I dunno, I just love this place just because of what it's theme is, where it is, and the diversity of what goes on in here.<//Review>

The best part of going to the Fantasy Castle Room is the funny looks on my co-workers faces the next morning when they ask what I did the night before.  Sometimes I explain more fully. Sometimes I don't.< /Text>

<Review>Everything was seasoned super well, the flavors were amazing! The wine and drinks choices were also really good. We had ordered three appetizers and two mains as well as dessert and drinks. Pickles were pretty good as well as the crevice. I recommend getting the mushroom broccoli flatbread. Also the hot warm chocolate cake with chocolate gelato super tasty.< /Review>< user>

Haven't been there in the day time in a while but night time women (waitress(es)) be tripping. You give them the money to their hand and they leave it on the table/counter without telling you so you may get robbed or get a chance to rob someone else. Customer service from waitress (thick Asian lady  behind bar with glasses) could use some work.< /review>

<Text>Great place. my favorite this about this place are the girls. Alot of hot thick latina's ( my favorite), and they are very friendly.  The setting and atmosphere is really cool. Everyone is chilled there, the dancers, the bar tender and  even the customers. I would still go there just for the hot girls, but the   entire chill atmospher makes it my favorite strip clubs I've been too.  I just paid for  a lap dance last time, I will go there soon, I will try to bring some friends. Only problem I have is not being able to wear a hat, I am kinda bald,  I am self conscious . I went to Spearmint Rhino the other week and I could wear my hat. Other than that I love Fantasy Castle and  How much is the VIP lap dance?< /Text>< Time>

<review>This place lacks customer service and the dancers do not know how to socialize. I gave three dancers money and not one ask me for a dance. The only thing good about the place was the $5 cover charge. I know now I should stick to all nude. These dancers looked like they were going through puberty and most of them were tatted up gangster chicks....< /review><time>1373085620496</time><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Girls are nasty and rachet for the most part unless you are interested into fat older chick's.  Place is ghetto as hell too, felt like I was in a penitentiary, the song gangsters and strippers they played was very fitting. 10 dollar cover NOT 5 like the other dude who reviewed this place claimed who is one of the top reviews. Good drink prices however during the week</review>

Senor Hector is easy to deal with and orders car parts (usually available in 1-2 business days) when he doesn't have them in stock. Quick, simple and straightforward. Recommended.< /review>

{'time': 1605326626256, 'text': "Jason, we're sorry you feel some how you were cheated having your wheel repaired at Eagle Dynamics. When you brought in your wheel it was evaluated and determined to be majorly damaged. We recommended more than once that the wheel be replaced but you were persistent that you wanted to have it repaired. We advised you that to repair it would be expensive and the wheel would never be perfect again. You were given a price of $350. and told it was not going to be a fast process!  You agreed to the price and timeframe. If you didn't like the price you didn't have to have it repaired! Considering the damage your wheel came in with it came out very nice. It was true enough to be easily balanced."}< /Response>
<Review>I do not recommend this company at all. 350$ for a repair & is still out of round by the eye. Took over 4 weeks to get the wheel back, they have poor communication skills. No one answers the phone when u call. My attorney will be contacting them in person to correct thus issue.<//Review>< userid>

A friend recommended me to Eagle Dynamics.  I hit a pothole & rim cracked enough to lose air pressure, I took it to them and they did a fantastic job on my rim repair that would have cost 1k for a new one. Thanks a million Eagle Dynamics for a job well done and for installing that wheel that you fixed on the vehicle without hesitation!!!! Highly recommended them!!< /Text>

<Review>I highly recommend Eagle Dynamics. The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly and professional. I had an appointment set and when i got their, they got right to work. They also finished the job faster than they estimated. They literally saved me hundreds of dollars, compared to purchasin new rims and their price was more than fair. I will definitely refer my friends, family and acquaintances. They do outstanding work and have great customer service.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Pics>

They are life savers !!!! Just bought truck that needed tires bad, was recommended by dealership West Coast Wheels & Tires (Sierra). Since buying ALL NEW tires, every other day had to put air in one tire. Took it back 4 times & NEVER repaired, they recommend grinding the rim !!! Was NOT gonna let West Coast (Sierra) do that !!! Cuz how was it the old worn tires NEVER leaked !?!?!
I KNEW where to go after all that time & wasted gas, “Eagle Dynamics” !!!! ALL the guys there ARE professionals, polite & courteous. They KNOW rims & recommend properly. Terry is the BEST !!!! THANX Terry. God Bless ALL the HONEST gentlemen who work there !!!<//text>

This is the second rim Eagle Dynamics has repaired for me, saving me oodles of money.  The first time I was able to have the rim repaired while I waited; this week they were much busier so I came back two days later to pick it up.  Both times they were friendly and efficient, and the price is great.  I highly recommend them!  Thank you guys!<//text>

Skip this place if you have custom wheels. They do more work on oem based on what i saw. Customer service isnt really their thing too if you want to be treated professionally.

A while back I spent $450 on welding repairs for one of my rare discontinued custom wheel. When i got there, I had to ask them twice while standing at their front desk for them to help me. The more i talked to Terry the more i figured that Terry seemed to stray away from custom wheels. He told me he could fix it but it would be expensive and I told him that i’m willing to pay his price as long as he does a quality job. I eventually went with him and dropped by every other day but noticed that my wheel sat in the exact same spot they had left it at. He told me he will get on it. Turn around time was 3 weeks. He charged me for chemically removing the anodize and do a full polish on the lip but i noticed he never did. He didnt remove the anodizing like he stated and didnt do the full lip polish except on the small repair area. None the less the wheel was repaired but i wasn’t happy with it considering this wheel went on a show car. I eventually sent it out to another place to have it polished and done professionally.

For the price and time involved just ship it out to the right wheel shops and skip this local one.< /text>

First time posting a bad review. If you notice any imperfections Terry will get mad and insult your character, then he'll say you are just trying to get a discount. When all you are trying to do is get it fixed correctly.<//Review>< pictures>

I had a bent rim, went in, quote was kind of high for my liking. Nonetheless it was my only option so i paid it. High quality work though. You get what you pay for.</text>

Terry is not trustworthy  and offers  dubious information. There are better places in the Fresno area to get your wheels repaired  or machined.<//Review>

<review>Soo pissed!! So a week ago I ran over a big pot hole and bent my rims, anyways I took it to eagle dynamics on Thursday to fix it and they said it will be done by Monday the latest, so I left it on the middle of the floor inside their shop and left, on Monday I received no calls about my rims so I called them Tuesday and they said it's almost done and for me to pick up on Wednesday today,  I went over there and turns out they didn't even touch the rims, tires still on it and where it was left when I dropped off the rims! I'm soo pissed cause they wasted my time!

They Alright guys do a little update from yesterday lol so the guys at eagle dynamics called me right now and made it seem like it's my fault, That I called Friday to pull it out cause I didn't want it done...but the thing is...  I never called Friday, I never even bothered to called about canceling anything, I just assumed since they're such a big company they would have started on it lol,  Now they're saying I actually called them and so that's why they pulled out of line, He's said he has the phone call record still on my phone.. quit lying to your customers! I never called Friday about canceling anything👎👎👎👎👎can't Meet quoted dates and lying to customers.. 👎👎👎 if I can go negative stars I would<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1488521078519, 'text': "Thanks to Tou Xiong  for the review.  It only strengthens our claim to be the best at what we do. Every day we save our customers hundreds of dollars and get them back on the road in a lot of cases the same day. We do apologize because of the volume of wheels we repair sometimes we get behind on our scheduled repair times. With all the recent rain everyone knows  Fresno is loaded with potholes. Because of that we have a lot of damaged wheels going through our system. We realize every wheel in for repair is much needed by the owner. We all need our cars and depend on them every day. We do our best to return each wheel as soon as possible. But  first and foremost is safety. We will not rush it through without first  a complete evaluation to determine if the wheel is repairable. If the  structural integrity of the wheel has been compromised we will not repair it. Your wheel went through the same evaluation and it was questionable for repair. About this time we received your call stating you no longer wanted to repair the wheel so it was pulled from the lineup. Just because you post a lot of false statements about eagle dynamics it will not  get your wheel moved ahead of everyone else and will not get you a discount or free repair. Eagle dynamics has reached out to you since your posting and offered to  expedite your wheel through the system and finish the repair. Just for the record you have declined and stated for the second time you don't want to repair it. We are sorry  your experience with eagle dynamics has not met your expectations. We will always try to meet our customers needs as quickly as possible. Unfortunately we have no magic fairy dust to make instant wheel repairs. Wish we did that would be nice. With 25+ years repairing thousands of damaged wheels, eagle dynamics track record speaks for itself. For many years  hundreds of people and families have been safely riding on wheels eagle dynamics has repaired."}</response><GmapID>0x80945953eaa86377:0x6a48060c70ddbb4a</GmapID></record>

I wasn't sure what the issue was so I called and they seemed nice and really cared about the issue. They were able to get me in within 2 days which was a lot better than a couple other companies I called. He was professional and adhered to all the Covid protocols. He thoroughly inspected the AC and I didn't get the feeling that he was just there to make some quick money and get out. After about 90 minutes of work it seems like the problem is fixed. I appreciated the honesy from them and their quotes were a lot more reasonable than some of the really big companies I talked to. I will for sure work with them in the future.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Steve Erwin,  Brandon Vacketta and Kyle Brummitt at Action Commercial HVAC are beyond professional!  They "listen" to your concerns and then develop an "Action" plan ( yes pun intended)  to service , you the customer's needs.

Our HVAC system is over 17 years old thus we needed expert advice and inspection of our system.   With a forecast of a major heat wave in the next few days, it was impairative to have the system serviced.  Steve came out and spearheaded the plan.

Brandon followed up, both by email and via the telephone, scheduling our service for the very next day!

Kyle responded and performed the inspection and service.  He was very honest and professional, never  attempting to "upcharge" us for any unnecessary repairs.  He even reached out to Brandon to discuss the system's status, which both gentlemen concluded was in fine shape for its age.

Kyle showed us his findings and gave our system a thumbs up for the upcoming summer season.   He reassured us that if we have any problems in the near future, Action will respond in a timely manner!

Both Steve and Brandon are aware, when we replace our HVAC system, Action is our choice!

Eduardo serviced our A/C system and did a great job. Checked and explained everything as he went. Recommended installation of a surge protector, which we had him install. Changed the HEPA filter and verified that the drain pan liquid overflow switch was working properly. All in all, we were very pleased with his service. As such, we renewed our service contract for another year.< /Review>

My experience with Action Air has been consistently positive.  Today was a good example.  The technician was polite, efficient and professional.  He asked me if I had any questions after he was finished.  Another thing I appreciate is that Action Air calls me to let me know when their technician is on their way in the time window they give me.  They also send a picture of the technician with the “on the way”
message.  This is a great security feature so you know who to expect at your front door.< /review>

Our technician Majid, was early, polite, professional, smart and most importantly didn't try to sell me on a new AC system, which some guys with white gloves had attempted to do, when I had them provide their annual Tune Up.  He showed me why we needed he part he installed, which was reasonably priced. They did such a good job I signed up for the two times a year service plan. I've spent close to 40 years in the residential real estate business, and finding a contractor I can refer to my friends and clients is not easy.<//Review>< rating>

< Review>
I hade Majid come out to replace my filters.  He did a great job.

Unfortunately he was unable to fix what another Action Air associate did.  My heater is still installed at an angle.  He said he would let his manager know that an intalation person would need to come out and correct it.

So far, it has been a week and I have not heard from Action Air.

Not real happy at this point!<//Review>

< Review>
Justin did a wonderful job showing us the numbers and answered all our questions. Action called when they said they were going to call and the timeframe for the project was exactly what they said it would be. The installers (Sean, Sam, and Gilbert?) showed up on time both days and kept us in the loop about everything going on. They wore shoe covers and taped down tarps to protect our wood floors. The company practice is seamless and dialed in. We were very happy with the service and would highly recommend them to anyone!<//Review>

I had a routine annual inspection. My two A/C units and one heating unit were all insoected and  monitered for performance. Four filters were replaced and both outside A/C units were hosed off for peak performance. An evaluation of the inspection was given to me  at the end of the inspection.  Couldn't ask for anything more than that...  I have used Action Air for 20 years and  have always been very impressed with the quality of their work.  An outstanding company.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><text>This was a routine service call, in a day and age where there is no longer anything “routine” about a service call. Shocked! Imagine, on time as promised, full explanation of what he was seeing and recommending, and the cost to perform the recommended service.
In no time, filter replaced, surge protector installed on the furnace and air conditioning. Then, even though the only mess he made was 2 small boxes and some play wrappers, he cleaned up and was finished.
Great guy, if only more companies had great employees like this!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>I’ve been using Action Air for more than 25 years and have always been more than satisfied with them. Their response to my requests are professional and friendly. All of their Service Techs are on time, or early, and are quite knowledgeable and happy to explain what they did and what needs further work, if anything.

Action Air will continue to provide all my heating and air conditioning needs.

Sean & his partner arrived at the specified time.  On the first day all of the old was removed.  They didn’t leave until the place was all cleaned up.  The second day they both worked together installing the new ducting, the heater & the AC unit,  They finished up by giving me all of the paper work.  Sean explained how everything worked and how all of the controls functioned.  The day after instillation it was hot enough to have to use the AC.  I was able to use the AC.  I was even able to show it to my Wife.  Thank you for such a good, & thorough crew.< /text>

I have a Home Warranty contract that sent a different company to fix my heater. After several appointments and a different reason for the heater not working I called Action Air. Juan was sent to assess the problem. Juan is knowledgeable, courteous and explained everything so that I could understand. He also showed me the old parts that he was replacing. Juan told me about the maintenance service which I signed up for. I finally have a heater that works! Thank you Juan.< /review>

< Review>
We signed up for Action Air's annual maintenance plan after they did such a great job handling an air conditioner problem at our home a month ago.  Their very capable technician came out for the first of two annual service inspections and gave our HVAC systems a very thorough review.  Turns out we needed to replace a capacitor on one of the two HVAC units which was handled on the spot as the tech had the right part in his van.   Tech arrived on time, and observed appropriate Covid-19 protocols both inside the home and outside.  This company has its act together.  Great on communication and very solid field tech crew.  Highly recommend.</Review>

< Review>
Major our technician was great and went above and beyond the service he provided. My issue is with Action Air as a company and it’s sales policy. After Majid’s inspection, he recommended that we install a surge protector to safeguard our furnace and AC unit. This would prevent the system from becoming overloaded and damaged in the event of a power surge or outage. I asked him why this wasn’t included in the initial build of our package seeing as how it would protect or $15,000 system from damage. Keep in mind, the AC system is not warranted due to power surge damage. Majid was super helpful but directed me to the service department.

I called the service department and was helped by the service manager, who explained that they have been trying to ask the sales department to include it within the initial AC build but they continue to refuse. Their reasoning is that,.... “there are too many add ons to present to the customer.” Also, they purchase the system through a manufacturer who does not offer a surge protector. But Action Air sells the system, and the surge protector, and the warranty. Hmmmm

This is my perspective (which means nothing). When you purchase a car you probably buy every warranty with the vehicle or the warranties that matter. Since my family is investing a LOT of money in this AC system I might want to purchase something that has umbrella coverage for the warranty or some small device that will protect it from an event that is not covered by the warranty?

The surge protector= $300, our AC system= $15,000+, our monthly maintenance warranty $13, Action Air’s response= PRICELESS (I’m being sarcastic).

Overall, I wish Action Air would change their policy or devote some attention to getting their sales and service departments to work together and provide the amazing level of customer service that I received from Majid.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Germane and Tyler arrived well within the proposed time window and went straight to work cleaning and testing all components of my air conditioning system.  Though they found several minor issues, they recommended replacement of only one item that would save energy and might even cause damage to other parts of the system. Germane covered all my options simply and in layman’s terms and suggested items required to fix and recommended items to defer. Very friendly, efficient service while remaining professional at all times.

Following up on the AC service last spring, Majid serviced the heating portion of my HVAC system this October. He arrived well within the time window, and thoroughly checked out every component on my heating unit. He was very knowledgeable about my unique furnace brand and assured me our unit was in great condition and was ready for Winter.

Overall, I’m very happy with Action and highly recommend them for all your heating and solar needs.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Nov 6, 2020  Today was a Scheduled Servicing and an install of 2 surge protectors on each Unit. Rajid did a very Professional job. He wore Mask n Gloves to Protect me. Thank  You Rajid for a Job Well Done. Everything was explained clearly and well.

Action Air is the top notch BEST. All the workers and people you come into contact with are knowledgeable and so very courteous. All are concerned that everything is right, and that you are satisfied with the work that is performed. LOVE Action Air Conditioning & Heating of San Diego. Thank you Juan Perez, it is welcoming to see you when you come to do the Maintenance on our 2 units. Twice now Juan Perez has been here to do the scheduled maintenance and it is good to have the same friendly Tech come back. Keep up the GREAT work Action Air. MYbad for not remembering all the names of the Guys that put in this Monster System we have. Our House is complicated, and the job took 6 days, Mon thru Sat. The Lennox Units are top quality, and so Super Efficient that when Juan comes to do the check, the Start up Amps don't register until he resets his checking tool thingy. Ours registers at 2, normal or more non-efficient units measure at 120. (This is what I learned today, and I am not versed on the technical  name).  Ours has a wifi thermostat, that I could not get to work so gave up. Today Juan and I got both units up to snuff. Awesome. Pic is the week of the install.< /Review>

Also, he left me a flyer about their “Action Rewards Club” but didn’t pressure me at all to join. But rather he briefly explained it, and said if I read it and then was interested, to give them a call & signup.
I was thinking oh no, here’s the sales pitch & pressure, but nope - he said read it at your leisure. I was so relieved.
And to top it off, my air conditioner works again! 👍🏻😄</review><Time>1560479213390< /Time>< user_name>

Travis did a great job and was a huge help.  My heat was out and upon inspection of my furnace in my buildings crawl space he discovered a leak in the building.  This was obviously a leak that had been going on for some time but nobody knew it was occurring.  He not only fixed my furnace (which had been installed incorrectly by previous owners) but took photos and videos of crawl space leak for us.  He went way above and beyond expectations.</Review>

<text>From day one, which goes back several years, we have found Action Air to be an ethical, straight-forward, professional and trustworthy company that provides expert installs and service at a reasonable cost.

Today, it was just for the annual maintenance check on our air conditioner.  The service tech was Thomas, who has been here a number of times for both heating and air conditioning needs.  Thomas is a expert and professional who likes people and gets satisfaction from servicing customers needs and educating them at the same time.  He is most knowledgeable and has excellent people skills.  Consequently, he is a tremendous asset to Action Air and has the abilities to advance within Action Air.  Please let Thomas know that we think highly of him and give him the credit he deserves.< /text>< date>

Antoine and Jimmy showed up each morning, on-time, ready to work. They kept the place clean and were respectful of my home. They finished when they said they would and the HERS testing went without a hitch. The Lennox equipment is very quiet and effective.  Great job!</review>

Juan Perez showed up on time, found the problem within 5 minutes, gave a breakdown and promptly fix the problem within 30 minutes.  Also Juan did not try and sell unnecessary items to me.  I was very satisfied with the visit!!!< /Review>

<UserId.>115019607281048267206</UserId.><Text>I have only good things to say about Action Air from beginning to end. I have never used the company before, however, recently  our air conditioning system stopped working properly. I called Action Air as they are local and got good reviews. I am happy to say those good reviews are well warranted. I received a ONE HOUR window and our technician, Luis, called at the beginning of that window and was here within ten minutes of his call. He was polite and listened to the issues and questions my husband had about our system. He seemed to know the problem right away and proceeded with the repair. He was done within an hour and our air conditioning system is now working properly. I will definitely use Action for any future needs and would highly recommend them to anyone who asks!<//Text><date>1509554762180</date>< rate>

Got super lucky Bill (service tech) was in the Eastlake Area when I contacted Action on a Sunday morning. My A/C and furnace installers yesterday forgot to restart my water heater before leaving.  Bill was friendly, personable and fixed my issue in less 3 minutes. Much appreciated.<//Text>

David did a good job and was very friendly. I have had a maintenance plan with Action Air for 1.5 years and so far they have done a great job. They don’t try to sell you something that is not really needed every time (6 months) they perform the regular maintenance. So far, so good.<//text>

ActionAir is our go-to for all HVAC needs. Juan did a fantastic job today on our furnace and went through in detail all the work performed.  We like to keep up with preventative maintenance so we don’t have any surprises.  Definitely are lucky that ActionAir keeps your system running like new!! Thanks Juan!!</Text>

German, my technician, was thorough and kept me informed of the air duct cleaning process. Very courteous and went above and beyond the call to inspect beneath my coach for possible damage to the ducts as well as look for any rodent activity. I so appreciated! He moved through the job quickly with concern to detail, and did not disturb me unless necessary. Explained possible issues I might experience down the road due to the age of my furnace. I will call upon Action Air again when I have my rental home serviced.<//text>

Very happy with Raphael and his team with Action AC for their new AC installation at my home. They explained everything, including my needlessly technical questions, quickly installed the compressor, air handler, filter, power, and drainage, tested the system (surprisingly quiet!), and explained next steps, all within about 6 hours. Great job!<//text>

Juan was a pleasure to have in my home.  He was on time, clean & neat, and ready to work. Juan took an appropriate amount of time to do a thorough service of my furnace and gave me a complete rundown of findings.  When finished he cleaned-up and inquired as to anything else he could answer or do for me. Juan is a wonderful example of Action Air employees and is certainly welcome  the next service.<//text>

Bill, our service tech was on time, explained what he would do and then promptly got to work. His attitude/personality were extremely positive and cheerful.  He was upbeat and affirming, and he answered all of our questions in a comfortable manner.

He offered us a preventive maintenance plan in an informative manner, but without any high pressure tactics.

Bill represented Action Air extremely well.<//text>

<text>Bill is an exceptional  technician!!  He’s fast, knowledgeable and is more than willing to spend time with you if you have questions about your unit and/or  thermostat.
For what he did, I thought the price was fair. The last person who came out wanted a $1000 and told us we were going to need a new unit in a few months. Our unit is old and will need to be replaced. However, our problem now was a clog hose that was fixed in a matter of minutes!!
Thank you Bill 🙏🏽< /text>< pictures>

<review>Horrible! Do not use this company! At first they were associated with Costco but we went with the company on their own. Mistake. About an hour and a half into it a worker stepped on the fire sprinkler in the attic and we now have extensive damage and extreme stress and inconvenience in our home! Drywall, carpet and tile damage due to flooding. Ridiculous! Stay away.</review>< Pictures>

So glad I went with Action Air to repair our AC unit. The contact center was incredibly nice and helpful and got an appointment for us pretty quickly. Our technician Bill was great! He was professional, friendly and PATIENT with ALL of our questions, mainly repetitive, figured out quickly assessed what was wrong with our unit and was honest and upfront with cost. He also explained the benefits of having annual maintenance without being pushy or upsell-y about it. Truly expressed the importance of the service and we’re so glad we did! It’s important to feel comfortable with technicians in your home and I felt like Bill did an awesome job of doing that. Like a friend coming over to help fix your home!  I’d recommend Action Air in a heartbeat! So glad I remembered seeing your trucks in our complex and that we chose you!< /Text>

He did not take long to find out why my air conditioner was not working, and had the parts to repair it right on his van, no waiting or crazy up charges! He offered me good advice on avoiding the problem I had in the future and gave me an option, was very helpful and I was impressed with how cool he was for being booked all day long on a Saturday and it was 90 degrees in the morning! Highly recommend action air and Thomas was great!!! Thomas you are "the man", thanks!< /Review>< pics>

Our scheduled time frame was 10:30-12:30.  He arrived about 10:45.  He explained what he was going to check, asked for the location of the AC unit and outdoor fan, and proceeded to the task.  He finished in about 45 minutes, flushed out the outdoor fan assembly, ran over the checklist of items he covered, and explained the maintenance plans that were available.  A very well done job!  My wife and I have been thrilled with the performance of our heating/AC unit and the low utility bills.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dbfe36c3b7a2c7:0x8e10768a0238d2b9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This was a complimentary one year maintenance check on our new Air Conditioning system. I was expecting a very basic look around since it was free but was pleasantly surprised of how thorough this check up was. Luis went right to work. Terrific young man that is professional and personable. A trait not seen much these days.</review>

Technician Bill Sanford had to completely disassemble our old unit in order to gain access to the part that needed to be replaced.  I mean cut multiple copper pipes, remove the whole coil, and then weld everything back in once he was finished.  With no access to fix later every solder joint had to be perfect.  This guy is super pro.  Thanks Action Air!</text>

We had German from action air clean our vents after a major tile install. The condo was a rental before we bought it so God knows what was already in the vents since construction.
During the tile job sweep up, we saw a fine coating of white death everywhere...
German vacuumed, air blasted, cleaned the vent covers and installed new filters.
Here’s to better breathing!<//Review>

His attitude was “what can we do with what you have and how can we extend the life of the older units?” There was none of the typical, “Oh these units are shot! You should look at replacing!” Very refreshing to have that mindset from my HVAC vendor! Highly recommend Action Air!</review><rate>5</rate><Resp>None< /Resp>< UserId.>

<review>I have been pleased with the service we've received since our AC & heating system was installed 10 years ago. Due to the routine maintenance performed twice a year, we have had excellent performance.  The technician,  David G. was very knowledgeable and professional.  I'm extremely happy that we chose Action Air.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Our air-conditioner went out during the latest heat wave and we were desperate to find someone to come out and fix it not just for our comfort, but for our elderly cat who we were very concerned about. Even though Bill was incredibly busy he took the time to call me back on a Sunday and come over to help us. He very quickly and professionally diagnosed our issue as a capacitor problem and had the part to instantly fix it. We had cool air blowing within a half hour of his arrival. He was honest, extremely capable and quick. We could not be more grateful to Bill and Action Air for rescuing us from the tremendous heat! Would highly recommend to anyone needing emergency service and we will be following up to get regular maintenance from Action Air as well because we were so impressed.< /Text>

Three years ago, Action Air installed our AC/Heater unit.  They have always been right on top of things!  Today, Juan, was our technician for an annual "check-up."  He was on time, even had "booties" to walk on our carpet with!  He worked efficiently and explained the results of the check up (our unit is working well).  Professional but friendly.  It is a pleasure to do business with Action Air!< /review>

Michael is an exemplary employee representing Action Air.  So polite and very thorough with making sure we understood the operation of the new digital thermostat installed.  He got everything up and running quickly.  He double checked that all systems were running smoothly with the new thermostat.  We are very impressed from the service we received from Action Air.< /Review>

The duct installation went very well. I replaced our entire duct system and the job took about 6 hours and they did a good job with the cleanup. The "first two" installers were kind and professional. During the install there were four registers that ended up getting bent or not fitting correctly and Ruben (one of the first stallers) came back the next day to replace and fix the four registers. He was really great and did a good job with the install.< /review>

We have worked with three Action AC team members so far and each of them was very personable, professional, and knowledgeable. They were very respectful of our house and household members (including our dog 👍🏼) while they were at our house. We are planning to have more HVAC work done in the future and will definitely use Action AC again.< /review>

<Review>We have never had anything but a great experience with Action Air and their employees. Today was no exception. Thomas was helpful, courteous, took his time and solved our problem quickly.  We only needed a band aid on an old AC system without spending a fortune and that's what we got. We will buy and have Action Air install our new system in the next several months.
Thank you to Thomas and Action Air!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Chris arrived first to clean the ductwork, then the crew came to replace my unit. I was surprised at how well the crew worked together, they were a true team, were professional, respectful to me and to each other, and knew what they were doing. Chris even stayed after the ducts were cleaned to help the crew move the heavy unit. They finished their work timely and left everything clean. They made sure everything was working and made sure I know how to use my new heating/air conditioning unit.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>While my overall experience with Action Air was fair, they left the job site dirty (dangerous for my dog if he would have eaten some sharp piece of metal) and the quality of finishing work was lacking. Also, something I was originally quoted was removed last minute in what I would say was a deceptive manner. While it's my fault I missed it this action seemed shady and not the kind of customer service I would hope for.

Edit: I was told a group of mangers wanted to come out, after your company disrespected my home I don't feel like having a bunch of you out. I did let Larry my sales rep know that he could come out but did not take me up on the offer.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The salesman who initially visited us, Larry S., was very knowledgeable about the products his company used and the process involved in installation.  The installers who did the actual work, Ruben and Antoine, were very courteous and professional.  They listened to our concerns, completed the job in a timely manner, went over the manuals with us, and made sure that all traces of the work were cleaned up before they left each day.

I have had outstanding service from everyone at Action Air from the installation, working with Eric Firman in 2013 to today, 04 January 2018.
I requested a service call and Thomas Batterton was sent.  I was extremely impressed with his knowledge, honesty and efficiency.  Thomas quickly resolved the  minor issue with my heat exchanger (actually a loose screw).  I feel confident having the Precision Tune-up Program to ensure the proper operation for years to come.  I couldn't recommend Thomas and Action Air more highly.</review>

<review>I called Action Air in for a second opinion because the company who usually services my furnace seemed to be doing a guessing game as to why it wouldn't work.  Turns out their second guess isn't the problem either. Bill who has a lot of experience explained several things that needed to be changed so I am waiting for the pricing to decide to fix or replace.< /review><gmapID>0x80dbfe36c3b7a2c7:0x8e10768a0238d2b9< /gmapID><Name>Deborah Newman<//Name>< Rating>

the service personnel are alwaysvery friendly, professional and do a great job!
I like that I can ask for a certain tech and usually get him for the service.  The reason for this is I have a protective dog and once he knows the person coming, he (dog)relaxes and accepts the fellow happily.
Over the years, there have been several different techs and all have been  excellent, polite, professional.   they really care and do a great job.

<GmapID>0x80dbfe36c3b7a2c7:0x8e10768a0238d2b9< /GmapID><Review>I had a two for one issue with both my heating and air conditioning unit going out. Being in inland San Diego this was an issue as it gets cold during the night and blistering hot during the day. I didn't want just any yokel contractor working on it because I hate having people come back three times for the same issue.

I checked these guys reviews after doing a search and they seemed to be very legit. The day of the appointment I sat waiting for the inevitable 10 to 15 minutes late appointment. To my surprise they actually showed up a minute early.

After shaking hands I led them to air conditioning unit to let them work their blue collar magic bracing myself for a huge repair bill since the furnace and ac were out.

After all was said and done it did cost me (not that going with someone else would have made much difference) But I have to say they fixed everything promptly and I haven't needed to call their techs back for any reason.

That's a reason for a top rating in my book.<//Review>< pictures>

Action Air is very customer conscious and seems to always be thinking of my household running smoothly on their equipment every day.  Juan came to service my great Lennox HVAC today and he was courteous and very personable, explaining what he was doing and why.  I felt a great sense of trust that he would do the best job possible.  I love the HVAC that action air recommended to me; they know their products and they keep them serviced with great enthusiasm and care.  I am so glad I am their customer.  I have had many servicers over the years, but these people are wonderful!  Just phenomenal! Thank you Action Air!</text>

<date>1513803792127</date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Action Air placed us on a cancel list to get us an earlier service and  Thomas Batterton took it upon himself to stop on his way home from his regular work day helping us get proper heat two days earlier than originally scheduled.
He was friendly and professional. He fully expalined his actions and findings during his diagnostics. He made no effort to upsell any service since the diagnostics showed proper operation of the unit.
Our discussion did suggest that a review of my programing of the thermostat might be useful. This ended up being the root cause of our troubles. With that reprograming we have had no further need to use the program reset on the furnace.
Well done Tom!<//Review>< pictures>
