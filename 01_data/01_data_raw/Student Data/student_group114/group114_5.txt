I've been to this shop 4 times and have had a great experience every time. Jo (my artist) is extremely talented and chill. The whole atmosphere is really welcoming.< /review>

Such a great shop. Everyone has a great vibe. Jo Atwood is amazing and she has far exceeded my imagination! She took my elements and put them together better than I pictured!!< /text>

Fip is awesome and professional. Just had a sleeve done there. I was on a mission to power it out. He fit me in and got it done in 2 weeks and a few sessions. Will definitely be back.</review>

I just had my sleeve finished by fip. Really happy with his service and of course the quality of work. He fit me in onn4 appointments in 2 weeks and finished the sleeve in 14 hours. I wanted a Japanese style dragon on my right arm and I know he is the one to go to with his years of experience. It turned out even better than I wanted or expected. Will definitely come back.< /Text>

<review>Dee is incredibly talented!! I'm not one for color tattoos (nothing against them, they just aren't my thing) Dee's ability to shade and add incredible detail to my tattoos never seizes to amaze me! He's freehand script on me, the consistency and the beauty of the words are a true favorite of mine! I admire his ability to take my thoughts and help me create a masterpiece I can be proud of! Complete strangers constantly stop me to complement me on the work Dee has done and ask me for his information. If you're looking for an artist for the first time or just want to try someone new I highly recommend Dee!< /review></record>

<review>Avalon 2 is the best shop in town. Here's a Game of Thrones peice done by the one and only D. Hes done lots of work on me. Also added the best lion tattoo I've seen. So stoked its mine.

When I moved to San Diego from the Bay Area, I had no idea who or where to go for future tats. My bud Dave who runs Fall Brewing a short walk away suggested Avalon  II & Dave Warshaw. Dave was awesome & the guitarist for Legendary band The Creepy Creeps. He has since moved on but the quality, coolness of the artists still here are excellent. I just had Mike do my last "Rat" tattoo..in and out the door in 20 minutes. Highly recommended!<//text>

Actually it was a visit to the Enigma Piercing part. Enigma is great, both of my daughters have highly "decorated" ears, & most of their work was done at Enigma (mostly PB location). They are meticulous, and informative, as well as being reasonably priced. I don't see any more piercings in MY future, but would happily recommend Enigma based on what I have seen through my daughters.<//text>

This shop was recommended by my regular shop back home in Seattle. From the beginning, Brandon treated me the utmost respect and was the pure definition of professional. He sketched my idea quickly and offered incredible insight to make it even better. The tattoo experience itself was the best I've ever had! I highly recommend this shop to anyone in town for a short time.<//text>

I went to a different tattoo parlor in the area and called a few more, and this place was by far the most helpful, informative, and welcoming. I was able to walk in and get a tattoo exactly like I wanted. I was just getting small words, and the other tattoo parlor had told me I'd have to get them about 5x the size I wanted. It was my first tattoo and D helped me out along the whole process! Highly recommend!</Text>

<Text>Jenna Aguon was guest tatooing at Avalon II, and she did my tattoo. She is so sweet, wonderful, talented, and has a gentle hand with the tattoo machine. She did a great job of making time fly by with our conversation,  and she genuinely cared about what I had to say. Most importantly, my tattoo came out infinitely better than I could have ever imagined.

Several other artists came and went while I was getting my tattoo. They all checked in with Jenna and me. Everyone was cheerful and worked well together. The bed was comfortable, which is important, since I have chronic pain, and it's hard for me to stay in one position for long. The bathroom was clean, which is a good indication of the pride that the artists take in their shop.

I'm so happy that I chose Jenna to do my tattoo, and that Avalon II was a comfortable, relaxed place for her to do her work.</Text>< pics>

<pics>None</pics><Text>There seems to be a lot of great talent in the San Diego tattoo scene... This shop is a must visit if you're considering a tattoo in San Diego. I like this place more than a few other shops as it feels more chill but not dive'ish and less millennialally trendy (Making up word now!) Parking can be a challenge but don't let this stop u from a visit... Some nice shops and eats to fill up at while the ink drys.< /Text>< date>

Tried calling first, tried walking in. Seemed like customers were a nuisance to the staff for wanting to pay them for their time.
Was told that wanting the tattoo I asked for (one color fake birthmark the size of a 50cent piece) was "really specific" with a groan.
How dare a heavily tattooed person already know what they want when they want to pay for a service. Find another shop, literally anyone is probably better<//Review>

Hands down the best tattoo shops around. I have had several pieces done there including a portrait of Johnny Cash. Mike Stobbe and Fip are amazingly talented artists. The shop is very clean. Everyone there is friendly. I can't wait to get my next tattoo from Mike!< /text>

Decent selection and the shop owner was friendly. Prices were above averages, but not exorbitant. I left with three records and I'd visit again when I'm back in town.
There were some old turntables blocking the classical section, which bummed me out because I've been keeping an eye out for a couple things, but if I'd asked they probably would've been moved. Overall, a good space to check out if you've got time to kill.</Review>

<Review>It was nice to check this place out for my first time recently. Great vibe with folks discussing music and old gear. I checked out most of their used records and ended up buying a "new" remastered old record - Rubber Soul. They have a few old amps, turntables, and speakers available - and do some repairs or can hook you up with someone to work on your gear.</Review>< pics>

Vintage audio gear and a terrific, if small, offering of used vinyl and cassettes. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. A gem of a shop that is definitely worth a visit if you're itching to dig through some crates.</Review>

A great little record store packed with stereo equipment, tapes, a few cds and tons of vinyl. They've got the new, old, rare and the bizarre. Carve some time out to discover something new, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.</Review>

Walked in and seller tells me he’s going to have lunch and waited all day. I just wanted to stay 10 minutes but I guess he couldn’t wait for clients to enjoy and buy vinyls. Very disappointing.<//text>

Had kind of an okay interaction with the lady while picking up food. I ordered the veggie chow mein and meatless general chicken, totaled like $26. The chow mein was full of veggies which is good but kind of bland. The sauce on the general chick was okay. Overall alright, but probably won’t be back.</Text>

Wonder elderly couple that runs this place is really nice. You get major neighborhood - ma and pop shop vibes here. A feeling that is rare in SF these days. They have a few tables in the dining room but I never really see people eating in at this place. I personally get things to go and pick it up. I believe most of their business comes from take out or ubereats. Prices are very cheap for SF, quality authentic chinese food.< /review>

You know when there is Chinese writing on the menu that it is very authentic.
Love the fact they have a very big ( no meat eaters) vegi eaters selection</Text>

Solid Chinese spot. We tried the general tsao chicken, may Lee veggies and pepper beef and they were all solid. Nice flavor, great portion size, very legit American Chinese food. The kitchen is really bustling and they move super fast, so expect to pick up it receive your food fast. On Friday at 7 they quoted ten minute to pick up our order. Definitely recommended over other Chinese places (other than San Tung) in this part of sunset.< /review>

Very good food to order and eat. Never dined in but ordered pickup and delivery (which is very prompt). Not sure what they put in their food but its like crack. We order a lot but sometimes barely have leftovers. Try the salmon/tofu/mushroom really well made but then again so are the other dishes.</review>

But I think people treat this more as a take-out shop, which is a bummer, because the waitstaff/cooks were incredibly friendly. At 7pm on a Sunday night, we were the only two here; however, the phone rang off the hook. I would definitely come back.<//Review></record>

Veggies are fresh, delivery is fast and flavor is on point. The Wei wei chicken entree is great and probably our favorite they are also reasonably priced.  Egg drop soup, won ton, salt n pepper wings and their noodles are all great too.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>May Lee is fast, Americanized Chinese food. It fast, cheap and generally just ok. The items tend to be overly sweet and a little greasy for the fried items. But if you are craving that General Tso chicken and need it in 5 minutes - this is your spot.< /Text>< Rate>

Also, be very careful with their on-line ordering system.
They do NOT honor their online ordering system.

For example, delivery is supposed to be free over $14 order. It is NOT free at all.
On the online ordering page, customers can select to tip on cash later, but they actually include delivery tip regardless of your selection.
The price on the online check-out is different from the amount on the sale receipt. I only knew this after I cash-tipped the delivery guy. Overall, bad experience.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I love a place with veggie versions of my favorite dishes. The General Tao was almost as good as  Friends but half the price and twice the portion. I just ordered the lunch special which came with soup, veggie egg roll (didn't even have to ask for it to be veggie), and a huge heaping of ricey goodness . I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes.< /review>

<Review>Wanted Wonton soup when I wasn't feeling well.  I didn't want to go far, and May Lee's was closest.  I was very surprised by the quality of the soup I got.  The wontons were large and homemade.  It also had a good quantity of chicken, shrimp, delicious shitake mushrooms and vegetables.  The broth was good.  I will eat here again when I'm not sick.<//Review>< pics>

<name>Chris Conner< /name><Time>1279428387571< /Time><Rate>3</Rate><text>it isnt exactly the BEST chinese food that i have ever had, but it is far from the worst. as many have said before me, it seems as if this buisness thrives on deliveries... but i ordered take out, so i can not comment on the delivery times.

i stopped by on my way home to pick up a quick lunch special. i ordered the spicy salt and peper pork rib and forked down the extra 80 cents to upgrade to chow mein. the pork rib was battered and deep fried... which was unexpected, and it turned out to be a touch oily. despite this minor flaw, it was perfectly seasoned, hot and delicious. the chow mein was veggie chow mein and the noodles were thicker than i am used to, but was far from the cheap generic stuff that you can find on every corner.

i have walked passed the place a few times before the smells finally enticed me to come inside. my first impression of the food wasnt bad... but wasnt great, but it was good enough to get me to go back and check out some of their a la carte items. the dinning room is really small, only 3 or 4 tables MAX.

i would recommend take out or delivery. the place isnt really flashy either, so it might be a turn down to some people in that nature.

i would suggest to at least try it for yourself... it is worth that much at least</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Man these fire wings is just that FIRE 🔥.
I’m not a wing stop type person rather make my own wings. But I really enjoy going to this place. This place is super clean the service is great and they got good craft beers there as well! I would come here twice a day if I lived closer to this location.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Excited to say, fire. Anytime and every time I'm asked.

Consistent, flavorful and welll executed. The wait can stretch depending on the time of day. Just don't stray away.

Excited to taste the drank on Tap when that opens. A few TVs to see the game.

Front of house service can be a little slow so be patient.  Luckily back of house is always on-point.<//text>

I came here with my boyfriend for dinner. We got the 20 piece family pack with lemon pepper, garlic Parmesan and salt and pepper wings. Everything tasted pretty good. I did notice that the wings were a lot more bratty at this location than the San Mateo one. I feel like it lacked a little bit a flavor but it definitely filled us up. The interior is cute and the service was very good. I think I would come back here again< /text>

Wide range of flavors for their wings. You're almost guaranteed to find at least a few flavors you like.

Online ordering has been broken the last few times I've tried, and I feel like they're sometimes a bit disorganized in general.

Still, the food is good, definitely recommended.

PS: they run out of chicken for the sandwiches pretty regularly. The wings are a much better option anyway.</Text>

<review>So disappointed! I use to drive to Berkeley just to get some Fire Wings, I was more than excited to find out there was a new location in the Concord area. (Close to me). But the quality was terrible. Over cooked, super dry, and under seasoned. I ordered the 10-pc combo; 1/2 Louisiana Rub 1/2 Lemon Pepper. Neither came out correct. Instead of fries I subbed for the garlic noodles, but they came out mushy. It’s suppose to come with a large soft drink but I guess they were out of cups (per usual 🙄) & gave a small soft drink yet charged the same price. Do not recommend.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Review>The food was cool, but the service was not so much. They served people before me that came in after me, and it took entirely too long for some wings and fries. They could have at least offered me something for screwing up my order and making me wait for over 30 minutes. They also wipe trays off with a damp towel, place liners on them, and reuse them instead of sanitizing them after people have eaten off of them. How unsanitary is that?< /Review></record></dataset><record>
<review>Tasty food. Slow service. Medium price. We went after a movie and dang, those wings were spicy and good. We got a combo (beat deal tbh) 8 wings, fries, and a drink for 13$, not too bad. They even have a pepsi drink select machine, never seen one of those before, so that was kinda cool. Besides the slow serving of food, we have 3/5 of us get served quick while two of us waited another 10 minutes, it was tasty, will go back. Enjoy!</review><gmap_id>0x80856784deec243f:0xecbc7d5353a1275c< /gmap_id><user_name>Roman Maximilian<//user_name><user_id>111037891204743999396< /user_id>< Time>

< Review>
I would like to preface this with the fact that I am from Buffalo, NY, so I am pretty picky when it comes to chicken wings.

Overall, this place was just ok. The wings just weren’t quite crispy enough and the flavors were ok, the hot wings were not spicy enough for my taste.< /Review>

<Review>The chicken was overcooked and I got the garlic and parmesan flavor and the chicken was drenched in it and was so overpowering that I got nauseous for like 5 minutes after 2 bites of it.   The garlic noodles were extremely dry as well.Im glad I was able to get my money back. 1st and only time</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Let me first start with the wings are excelent, lots of sauce, and a great variety of flavors.

However, placing orders from them is almost a nightmare.
1) Their website is not very intuitive, and when you get to the point of checkout if you use an unsupported card (like Amex), it just says your card is decliend.  Not that your card isn't a valid type for this business.
2) When the website was difficult to use, we opted to call our order in.  This place doesn't seem like they ever want to answer their phone.  We spent 5+ minutes trying over and over before we finally got someone on the phone.
3) Ordering a drink from the bar is a nightmare when the bartender doesn't acknowledge you were there when he was off chatting it up with other guests, then just left to go back into the kitchen.  We asked a couple of different staff members if someone could serve us, and they said they would get someone.  We ended up walking to the front and asking the original bartender to server us.

Store cleanliness could use a little work.  Lots of tables had trash on them, not allowing other guests to be able to sit.

Like I said at the start, the wings are excellent.  Not overcooked, lots of sauce, and a great variety of flavors.  But the lack of customer service is irritating.  I, as a customer, shouldn't have to go out of my way to place an order.

I'll give this place another try in a few months.  Hopefully, on my third visit, they have it all figured out.</Text><username>Matthew Fosenburg</username><user>116737626196573866123<//user><time>1577984741800</time>< Pics>

I love this place a lot. I find this place really relaxing and with a lot of positive energy. The people are very nice and will talk to you with great energy. I even made a friend which would be difficult when i have social anxiety.<//Text>

The people working there are incredibly friendly, helpful and really cared about my shopping experience. I live in San Diego and travel frequently to the Central Valley.  This will definitely be a regular stop.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Still love this store, though I noticed they don't have half the aromatherapy they once had. Seems they took out quite a bit of stuff to keep it from being so crowded inside, it's easier to navigate now without knocking things over. That's the up side. I've never been in here that I didn't fall in love with the staff. Always such friendly upbeat people.<//review>

Lots of metaphysical items, real Crystal's, tapestries, jewelry, wind chimes... oh I found Guatemala worry dolls there too! Haven't seen those since I was a little girl. The woman and man working the cash register were super nice and helpful, very personable. Loved the vibe and feeling I got from this store.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) I love that place, it's very nice, good prices, I like the peace that there is in that place, and more than anything I always find the stones and crystals that I need.

Plenty to choose from! There's even a small walk-in refrigerator with lots of specialty beer, wines, and handcrafted liquor drinks.
Also, all the people that work there are very nice and helpful.</Text>

<text>I've worked down the street from this store for a few years now. The old owner Ted was very nice and such a sweetheart however the store was long overdue for a makeover. It's been about a year now under new ownership and the new owner Danny has completely transformed this store! He is very nice and knowledgeable and very down to earth! He definitely brought in new young and fresh ideas. It is now fully stocked with a huge selection of wines, liquor, a beer cave and groceries! He is also in the process of building a cigar room!!!

Side note: I am an architect and designer so I have been taking progress pictures every time I stop by! They did a great job!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><UserId.>118329189129721911662<//UserId.>< Time>

Don't use your credit card here. Stole my credit card number twice.  Your card is swiped on a device you cannot see, and you will later will find fraud charges.<//Review>

Staff is very friendly, and they have a fairly good selection of snacks and drinks.  Not much else can be said except its very clean.</Text>

Not sure why but I always go here for filling my propane tanks, usually 2 or 3 at once.   Good service, and reasonable price is probably why 😎< /Text>

<Review>BEWARE There is a bike chained up to a sign post that has been at this place for at least 9 months. The creepy clerk with red hair and pasty white skin is telling people they can have it, that it is abandoned and a nuisance, please take it. Then he calls the cops and they arrest you. It happened to me on the 4th of July. The bike is still there. They are still entrapping people, it is really awful. Boycott this place, if you care.< /Review>< pictures>

I live around the corner and this is the second time i've been there (due to the virus & service) and had to wait till the barmaids friends were taken care of to be served. They came in after i did but she rushed to take care of them, left me waiting. I'll come back, but not as often as i want to. Sure as hell won't recommend it to my friends and family!!!< /review>< username>

Reminds me a lot of the food is from the '70s. Found the service to be very friendly, the atmosphere nostalgic, and overall very clean. Would recommend and return here!< /Text>< name>

<Review>This was recommended by Fifty Shades pet Grooming. In Winchester. Our favorite pet Grooming. We tried it out week and half ago.  Excellent food and service.  Our waitress was the best. All covid preparedness was in place too.  We decided to take our best friends there today to see what they thought.  Its definitely our spot to go to now.  We all ordered different menu items.  We all give it a 10.<//Review>< Pics>

We felt right at home, & to see they support my Bakersfield NASCAR driver Kevin Harvick Hell yeah. The bartender was great very tentative to not only us but every one else & our beers were ice cold as they should be served. We happened to be on the 2 pizza night special & they were excellent. We will definitely be back< /text>

Quick service...Friendly. $4.00 for a "Longneck" is a bit pricy but it is a clean place and beer is cold. Senior-ish, non-drinking Karaoke crowd (gotta hurt bar sales) makes Karaoke ruff for those who drink...i spent $75.00 (drinks & tips) in a few hours and was only called up twice! I WILL NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN!!!!!😡<//Text>

< review>
I thought there was Karaoke on Saturday. There was a band, female lead singer was great.

The menu had tons of pizza, if you like pizza. I don't eat pizza anymore.

I was looking on the back menu which I like. Yet the bartender told me, "Sorry, those are for Tuesdays only". What? It said "Taco Tuesday" at the top of menu and they had all kinds of food listed that was not tacos.

So I flipped it over and saw the front (I don't eat fries or onion rings since I'm on a keto diet) and I was not interested in anything on the front menu. I ordered a margarita instead. Strong drink too.

If I do go back, It will be on a Tuesday. I think Ill stick with Riverside for Lake Alice or Dukes for karaoke and food.<//review>

I went there for the first time to try the karaoke on a Thursday evening.  I had a good time, was a decent-sized crowd m  from what I understand it was a fill in DJ . I don't know who normally runs the karaoke. I plan to go back. The food is excellent, The prices are a fair for the food.  I don't drink so I don't know anything about the bar section
I know that the bartenders they were nice they handled serving the food.< /Review>

Bar hasn't really changed all that much from the previous owner, except the removed all the pool tables that used to be in the front if the bar and gave it a more dance floor type feel. I personally have yet to be there on a busy day, mostly just a few bar flies or a couple or two here on a date. The staff is friendly however and the prices are reasonable. I would suggest stopping in if your looking for that dive bar feel or just want to have a drink in peace. If you're looking for a party I'd go elsewhere. Still worth a visit though.< /Text>

<Text>As usual this is the gem of Winchester. As soon as you step in you swear you went into a portal that takes you into a bar in Wyoming or Colorado. You have the pool tables, the bar and seriously the best food that any restaurant around has. The bathrooms are so clean you can eat in them. There's always good tunes playing on the jukebox. If I could buy a bar it would be this one. They really have the right formula for success.< /Text><rating>5<//rating><Pics>None</Pics>< username>

Went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. They open at 9:00am, but the kitchen is not ready until 9:30. Otherwise, the breakfasts are huge portions and taste like everything is made from scratch, whether that's actually true I don't know. The bloody Mary's are just $5.00 and they come in a pint glass with olive, celery, and bacon strip, and are moderately spicy, but you can ask for it mild. The service seems slow, perhaps short-handed, or maybe just slow in the morning. Food preparation seemed slow too, but worth the wait.</review>

< Review>
Had lunch today and I love their pastrami sandwich. That and a couple beers and great service was great. I go there when ever I get a chance. I have to add that today I had the pattymelt and wow the best I've ever had.I love pattymelts and theirs is by far the best. Can't say enough.< /Review>

Found this place by accident..looking for a restroom actually while driving from Hemet to San Diego..suprised to see food being served.  Checked menu..hungry..so we stayed and have the most suprising PIZZA  I have had since leaving CHICAGO 49 YRS AGO!!!   HAVE RETURNED EVERY CHANCE I GET..OUTSTANDING SERVICE..GREAT COOK..CHECK OUT THE CHICKEN WINGS..HAMBURGERS AND IF YOU DRIVE BY AND DON'T GET A PIZZA...SHAME. ON YOU. !</text>

<text>Please disregard my silly photo. Lol
This place has all three things you’re looking for at a good bar. In one corner are the pool tables, the other is for dancing and live entertainment which is usually pretty good if Cougars* is playing;) and centralized around everything is the half round bar for the gals and flys that enjoi sports on two televisions.

< Review>
Almost evrybody there is pretty new but let me just say they finally got some babes for the name and they are friendly and they are there for the customer first their not there for their r own personal wants or needs . so if you like pizza and beer or cocktails and football live music pool karaoke and the owner chrissy although she is my sister i gotta say she's doing an awesome job. She does her best to make sure her girls have everything they need and then   their's the manager Lindsay she's awesome she holds it together when she needs tp which is quite often so lets all support our local bar and spend our timer and our money (lol ) there .</Review>

Called and talked to Ivan who was very helpful. Gave me the email address to place order and was able to pick up the order by 3pm the same day.  Reasonable prices and fairly quick service.  Very professional and courteous.  Thank you so very much for a pleasant experience.<//review>

< Review>
Nature’s owner Blake is unprofessional.  The products are overpriced, incorrectly delivered, and returns refused.  Direct quote from Blake “I run a $50 million dollar business, I don’t need your pennies worth of business.”
At end of call Blake still refused to replace or return the errors and threatened to take me to court.
Blake is willing to lose what was $5-$6k per week in orders for approximately $180 in returns and fixes.<//Review>

Our food showed up early and hot like it came right out of the oven. We had three p different pasta dinners and they were fantastic. The flavors were on point, the bread and the salads were fresh and delivered in separate bags. (Cold food in one bag and hot food in another bag). Thank you for that!
I am so impressed with North Beach Pizza. We haven't had a lot of good food in the neighborhood since covid-19 started. The restaurants in our neighborhood have had many changes. Some really needed to change and didn't, and others shouldn't have changed and did. But North Beach Pizza can always be counted to have delicious fresh food.
I thank you very much for all your hard work and your dedication during the pandemic to making delicious food for all of us. I appreciate you.<//Text>

< Review>
I moved here from New York, couldn’t find a decent slice of pizza, tried a few random spots, then I found north beach pizza because someone praised it on Twitter or Reddit, and I was thoroughly impressed. I usually get a small cheese pizza and a small salad with Italian dressing. The pizza is really good, it’s doughy, the sauce is really good, just the right amount of cheese. My favorite part of a pizza is the sauce-y river where the cheese meets the crust. I usually pick my first slice based in which one is the biggest or which slice is the best looking. The salad is really good too, I don’t eat enough vegetables but I like their salads, the vegetables are fresh. I get the Italian dressing, I try to commit to finishing the salad before I go for the pizza but I don’t always make it. I started ordering larger pizzas, wrapping up the extra slices for lunch the next day or two. Oh! the pizza comes with a little thing of Parmesan and red pepper flakes, that is a nice touch. The salad comes with a fork and some great durable napkins, it you know how to fold them properly you can really make them last. So yea overall I think they got the best pizza in town, at least compared to the few random spots I tried.< /Review>

<Review>The pizza was great. I am giving them 3 stars because of the drink situation. I feel like its dishonest to post on your website 20oz soda's for $3, then send 12 oz soda cans with the order. Had I know I was spending $6 on two cans of soda I would have opted not to buy it. The pizza though was excellent. I just wanted to warn others about the drink situation and what you actually get as their website is wrong.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I just ordered a very good thick crust pizza. I ask for no pepperoni and guess what it was loaded. the 14 piece wing was the worst I have EVER had from this location, see attached picture. The wing looked deep fried hours ago and sat under the heat lamp there was no mositure period. Totally to hard to eat and the kids had melted off the hot sauce, blue cheese and them leaked all over.normally, they had the best wing that used to be juicy plumb and cooked to perfection. We hat happened guys?? I used to brag this pizza and wings joint up to all my friends, co workers, etc... But never again they lost a good paying customer. So disappointed in Ingleside< /text>

I’m too busy wolfing down the delicious pizza to write anything down!

Honestly, I ordered a pizza with meatballs extra cheese and artichoke hearts it came within a half hour and it’s probably one of the most delicious pizzas I’ve ever eaten!< /review>

<Review>1) taste. Eggplant Parm was served as 4 patties that were sitting in lemon juice. The sourness was so high, it was not edible. The serving tray looked like a TV dinner and included about one handful of fettuccine and terrible overcooked vegetables.
The sun dried tomato pasta was eaten but was WAY too creamy and the tomatoes were too large, not sliced.
2) delivery. The order was at 6:54pm for two pasta dishes. The food arrived at 8:30pm.
3) price. $50 for two pasta dishes.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Woah!!! I haven’t had north beach in years! To savor those familiar flavors of pesto and Hawaiian and perfect crust; it made the evening happy. I decided to give it a try since I signed up for their discounts that alerts me to their attention</Review>

This place has alot of choices and it's all very tasty. It reminds me of a Mimi's Cafe, but great! Waiter and table staff are always attentive and the food comes out pretty quick. There's a small patio area surrounding the front half of the restaurant if you want to have your little ones join (pets).<//Text>

<Review>My pizza is always perfect. I don’t like thick or too thin and they always adjust my crust to medium for me. All ingredients are fresh and the mozzarella is 100% cheese and amazing. Customer service is always pleasant and my pizza is always ready in around 20 min. I drive 30 min for this delicious pizza!!!< /Review><user_id>112091105404592803780< /user_id><Name>elaine james</Name><GmapID>0x808f7fcda7ec724b:0xd14434a30760775a<//GmapID>< rate>

Always a pleasure to dine at NBP/University Ave. The staff are super friendly, and the food is consistently yummy. We usually get the Greek Salad and the Margherita Pizza (no tomatoes). My new favorite part of the decor is the paint-by-numbers of John Wayne, I just recently noticed.</text>

EVERY SINGLE TIME I come in here, WOW. I don't know how you feel about survival but if there was a zombie apocalypse, and I had to choose between my offspring and pizza... Sorry mah dude. If you can keep up, meet me at North Beach Pizza. Steaming slices on the fly, bomb wings on deck. Garlic bread had me flossin, and I don't even dance.

I don't sling out 5 stars for nothing but holy moley. NBP is the forkin spot.

French fry game is weak.  Fried chicken sandwich has more breading than chicken, cut it in half to see.  Neighboring table's fried chicken sliders were raw.  So two tables sent food back.  Staff was nice.</text>

<text>STACKED is always good. I've never been disappointed with the quality of their food.  It's a bit expensive (4 people 4 burgers,  nacho(highly recommend) appetizer,  chips and guac appetizer, garlic parm fries (highly recommend), 2 beers,  3 drinks), $106.67. I wasn't complaining, I've been here before.  You are paying for a really great burger! It's gourmet burgers!  The best part though,  the service.... my waitress was on it! The place was super busy but our food was quick.</text>< pictures>

The other menu choices were just so so. We ordered artichoke dip, Arnold Palmer and Korean Bowl. None of those were anything special.
The service was great though! Very attentive, helpful with some gluten free menu questions.
Would order the lobster mac again, but to go. Place felt grungy.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The menu here is great and full bar is fabulous. This has always been one of my favorite places to eat. Great service and features! I have been out of town for a while and wish I could just find a good place like STACKED! The environment, food, and service is unmatched.< /Text>

The food was not that good.  Burgers tasted greasy and was just too much.  The kind where after you don't feel so hot.  The service was really good though. Our waitress was really helpful<//Review>

There were some delicious pancakes eaten at Stacked! Built my own creation with buttermilk pancakes, peanut butter, cookie butter, berries and peanuts!! Super yummy!! I did actually have whipped cream on there, and they forgot it, but I’m not mad they were still great pancakes with delicious toppings! We also had some monkey bread nuggets. Needed more icing but otherwise very good. The staff was very friendly and attentive to the table. The location is easy to get to and has ample parking.<//text>

Food was good, service was good. Fries weren’t very good, they were soggy/oily and kinda underdone. I got the wake up call burger and it was really good. As was the cheeseburger Mac, both are recommended, skip the fries.</Text>

<time>1605948558986</time><review>I walked in and placed an order to go at the Stacked location in Huntington Beach, I waited over 25 minutes which seemed like a long time to wait. I asked the waitress to check on my order and turns out it was waiting at the cashier for me but no one from the restaurant let me know, my first response was "how long has that been there? I've been sitting right there waiting for this.. Why didn't anyone tell me it was ready?" All I got from waitress was "I'm sorry"..

So I left the restaurant feeling really annoyed and decided to see how cold the food was and I could tell right away it was and the buns were just soggy. So I went back in the restaurant and asked to have my order cooked again which doesn't seem like an unreasonable request. The waitress said ok and I went outside to wait, a few minutes later the manger Michael came outside and said my food was being remade and I wouldn't be charged for the meal.

So I finally get my food which by the way was not remade, thanks for lying to me Michael. It was the same food I originally recieved with the same soggy buns and just warmed up. So let me get this right, you made me originally wait for my food and then you made me wait again a second time so it looked like you were remaking it but you only warmed it up. What a joke do you guys feel good About this? Did you all have a good laugh knowing that I was waiting for my food to be remade but it was actually my original cold food that was handed back to me.

One of the burgers should've been well done but if you look at that photo does that look well done? The other photo is your bar that's packed with customers. How is that possible with all the Coronsvirus restrictions and social distancing requirements.</review><Rate>1< /Rate><gmap_id>0x80dd26685c762929:0x86eba84563d31ad2< /gmap_id><user_id>113741949124407412352<//user_id><name>Sean Burns</name></record>

Great food great service! Affordable! Got the lobster seafood Mac n cheese , garlic parm fries, and the wake up call burger. Both absolutely delicious! Added the crispy onion string to the Wakeup call. Both girls were very quick and helpful. Highly recommend! Total bill was only about $30 so we were surprised considering how much seafood was in the Mac! Very good!</text>

Awesome place! You’re able to customize any order using their in-house drag n’ drop app. Recommend getting their flatbreads if you want something unhealthy but taste great.<//review>

<review>The food was good but the service was horrible. I took my girlfriend here for our 6 months and called in advance if there was indoor seating and if so if we should make a reservation; we were told there was no seating available at all inside. However, upon our arrival there were a numerous amount of people eating inside. From there we were asked if we would like to eat outside or inside and we asked for inside seating. The Hostess looked for a solid 10 seconds and immediately sent us outside. She sat us next to a heater that was run-down. The party behind us however were sat down next to a fully-functional heater and the party behind THEM were sent INSIDE. In addition, she sent the only black party of two to the completely other side of the patio area. I don’t understand if we did anything to offend the STACKED staff, but it was a strange interaction to say the least.</review>< Rating>

< Review>
The staff at STACKED is very friendly, and accommodating. Ive probably ordered every type of burger that they offer, and they're all top notch, including the vegetarian option.
For anyone that has not been here, the kombucha on tap is a must. The quality of their ingredients is off the charts, which doesn't make people feel too guilty of eating out.</Review>

At the moment  you step in that place  the stuff gives you a comfortable feeling. Very courteous waiters, it is a friendly restaurant to  pass time with buddies or with your date. yummy  cuisine, talented  chief cook and stuff, modest  pay and courteous  service. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Good news is that the food was really tasty. But... Overpriced and coupled with poor service today. There are too many other options to give this place another chance.
Specific issues include:
I understand (kinda) the use of qr code menus. But it's annoying. Just give me a paper copy.
Put your prices on your menu!!! I get that places don't always provide their menu prices online. Then make another option so I can see what I'm paying when I'm your establishment...
The entrees are overpriced. The (tasty) buffalo chicken sandwich was $13. With no side. The side of fries (a true side order, not a basket) was $4. It's just not worth 17$ for sando w fries. Even the plainest of burgers was $9. Maybe I just don't understand?
I asked for ranch!! It wasn't busy. Or how about I don't have to wait (literally) 20 minutes after eating to get my bill?< /review>

<text>With an array of options this wonderful place let's you customize almost any meal to your creative pleasure. With this being my first time here I chose to stick with a simple choice of a burger the "wake up call" and was not disappointed. Definitely will be back with an empty stomach and recommend all to visit and experience the great food along with the atmosphere.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dd26685c762929:0x86eba84563d31ad2</Gmap_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN0ykaVMDXWTx2Jy_CBdxOx9HgQlXY3bS5iO12=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><rate>4</rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>The atmosphere here is great. There is one entire wall of open aired windows and a large, u-shaped bar. Unfortunately, we've had very spotty service and inconsistent food.
This place specializes in the ability to modify any dish however you want. However, whenever we've asked for mods, the kitchen has ignored it and we've had to send the dish back. Very frustrating.
Don't sit at the bar if you expect attentive service. The bartenders are always swamped and under-staffed. They are friendly though.
There are a few breakfast dishes that stand out--both the Chilaquiles Benedict and the Smoked Salmon Benedict are delicious.
This place would be a good spot to grab drinks and socialize with friends.</text>< pictures>

<time>1547343389736</time><Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Good times 😁
Has a million televisions but not one with the Los Anlenges Kings . 😡
Staff is really cool . 👱🏼‍♀️
They chatted with us for a long time. 🤹🏼‍♀️🗣
Open late . 🌚
Parking can get squeezy at peak rush times. 🚙
Patio over looks traffic ridden highway/street but is hidden by well designed privacy screening.🛣
Great location near highway and shopping mall. 🗺
Menu was standard pub grub. 🍔🍟🍕🍖🌮🍗🥨
Has an electronic ordering system that uses an iPad to eliminate the need for wait staff👨🏻‍🍳🤖 and help you over order beer and food.
Portion sizes are small. 🍽
Beers are 10oz but can fool consumers by a server under filling glass. 🥃
Small selection of mainstream large batch craff brewwing owned by larger corporations. 🍺 🏰🍻
Great for families🤱
Ok for kids too 👳‍♀️👶🏽
Good for a quick stop alone at the bar🧙‍♂️
Perfect for date night 💏</Review>< pics>

<Review>Really trendy restaurant. Service was good. My salad had great flavor. We had flatbreads, hamburgers, etc. The BIGGEST PROBLEM is there are little flies all over the place who were as hungry as we were... the manager was aware of the situation and paid for our whole lunch. That was very kind.</Review></record></dataset><record>

This place is genuinely awesome! So many good/yummy drink and food options. Something for everyone. Happy hour, late night, casual place. Sooo many GF options... it’s great! Cool IPad ordering with easy to use options/visuals. Good TVs, lots of seating, fun atmosphere. Favorite place in Huntington when we visit family. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼</text>

Best jalapeño burger I've ever had, really good and are all under $10!!!!!
Ordering through the tablet is a little complicated at first but you get used to it.
Their service in this place is great, the food quality is amazing< /Review>

<Date>1580847098273</Date><Review>Salmon burger, fries, and a gluten free mac n cheese. Staff was helpful and nice. Prices were very reasonable. The fries were hot with a lovely crisp outside and soft interior. The sauce on the salmon was just ok. I subbed onion straws for the raw onion - it was good. The GF Mac was delicious. The only real complaint is that you can't really easily tell what is GF on their IPad. When you get it right it shows a specific icon (that wasn't explained to us), but I would rather have the ingredients noted with a notation beside each. Definitely would come back.<//Review></record>

<review>It was a really bad service they made me wait in the front door for 15 minutes and they took a lot of time to bring the food services was horrible all the staff was in the kitchen eating while I was waiting to be served plus my food was cold and soggy and also when I left they left me waiting for a long time for some to received my payment so I am not coming to this horrible place.

Food is good but not great, they have the electronic menu board on each table which some people might like but I think it cheapens the place. Service is friendly they have  a bar with good selection of drinks.  Their whole grain nut pancakes are very tasty, but not sure if I would be a regular customer for breakfast/brunch just based on pancakes, the rest of their food like I said it's just ok.<//Text>

When I entered, I was greeted right away and taken to my table. This is not your typical restaurant and my server took her time and carefully explained it to me. There are no prices on the menu but on an electronic device with a touch screen. You can order a regular menu item or build your own which is what I did. The food came out hot and delicious. I had an egg scramble with cheese bacon and sausage. Very generous proportions. Also a cinnamon French toast. It was great even when cold. I recommend it.<//text>

<review>Mac n cheese is good. They have a lot of different choices and options. The prices can vary quite a bit when you are adding and removing items from your entree. I had the Cajun shrimp Mac n cheese and my boyfriend had the Lobster and Seafood Mac n cheese. It was nice to add extra things that you would think goes well. They also have some milkshake choices. We had the Turtle Cheesecake. We were too full so we couldn’t finish it all but it was delicious as well. The serving sizes are good in my opinion, I couldn’t eat it all. The service is kind of awkward though. There’s a wait staff but they also have these tablet things that you order off of so it’s kind of confusing. Use the tablet thing otherwise you won’t know the prices. I would come back here again.<//review>< Response>

The food was good. However, half filled orange juice cups is unacceptable. If they want to proportion it, why not get smaller cups so it’s not so obvious.<//review>

We liked this place. The service was very good. Nice people make a difference. Even better when they're good at their jobs.
My girlfriend liked her burger. The beer float was surprisingly good. Loved the turtle cheesecake shake. I'm not crazy about sitting in the walkway and would have preferred one of the many open booths but I'm sure we could've had one of we spoke up so no fault of theirs. The chili cheese fries were disappointing and the pork bites were ok. Overall a good experience. I will try it again.< /Review>

Loved it. Came here randomly for breakfast with my friend and we plan on coming for dinner tomorrow too before I fly home. I had the whole wheat pancakes with fruit and granola, thin crispy fries, and a chocolate and peanut shake. Everything was delicious. I didnt need syrup for the pancakes because they were perfectly moist. The fries were the absolute best part to me! Then again I love fries. They were very reminiscent of BJ's fries. The shake was very good too! I order mine with no whip cream on top and enjoyed the peanut butter cup chunks. Definitely a nice little place.<//Text>

<Review>Great food, I like their tablet ordering system but prefer communicating with a real server, glad they have both and the servers are really good and nice. Food is ready pretty quick, plenty of parking and the wait is not bad, during the day there is no wait. Pet friendly and kid friendly. Try the flying pigs, my kids love those.< /Review>< user_name>

<text>Holy yum! My husband and I had the onion strings, garlic parm fries (10/10), the prime rib sliders and the fried chicken sliders. Everything was absolutely delicious but I am in love with the fries. So much garlic and so much yum. The service was great and we loved being able to cash out on the tablet when we were ready to go. We will definitely be back!< /text>< Resp>

It's a family restaurant as well, the food is outstanding (I strongly recommend the garlic chicken sandwich).

Its reasonably priced, and after a couple of beers with lunch or dinner, you probably won't leave hungry.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Best chicken sandwich I've had in forever. Really good service. Wish there were prices on the menu though. It's  tough to decide between entrees and additions when you don't know the cost. And the restaurant is open to Edinger, so it gets pretty noisy and a little too cool if the weather is chilly.<//review>

They have an iPad at the table where you can very easily customize your order that works very well! You can easily add or remove any part of your dish or move things to the side. The tlprice updates clearly along the way and it's easy to see if you're keeping your order vegan or gluten free if that's your thing. I'll probably be back this week.</review>< Pics>

Very positive experience. I called in around 1045 to see when they stopped serving breakfast and was told noon. When we were seated at the restaurant, we were informed that breakfast had stopped at 11. My wife and I were pretty let down intially, as we had breakfast here before and knew how delicious it was. Seeing how crushed we were, our server Nick ran back and convinced his manager to make an exception for us, without us having to ask. We stayed for an amazing breakfast and will continue to go here. Thank you Nick, and thank you STACKED.< /Review>

The food here is AMAZING. However, my wife and I can't always sit down in the restaurant, so we often order out.

The online ordering here is the WORST. The food is RARELY even done on time with what the site tells you, and the kitchen often messes up the order by leaving ingredients on your order you said you didn't want or forgetting to include your dressing for your salad(s).< /Review>

<Review>Drinks werent too good, but the food was excellent.  I got the pepperjack cheeseburger and my wife got the cajun shrimp mac n cheese.  She usually doesn't like burgers but she liked this one.  Her dish was delicious as well.  We will be back to try out more of the menu.<//Review><user_id>108485889758971348494</user_id><GmapID>0x80dd26685c762929:0x86eba84563d31ad2</GmapID><Response>None</Response><Date>1582949005594<//Date><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

This was my first time at this restaurant. I was so impressed by the staff and food. The Decor and the open door feeling made it feel like you were eating at home. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. I would love to have this restaurant near me in Surprise Arizona.</review>

I have talk to grampa about this place before so I wanted to bring him. Yet to my surprise I was very disappointed when after we got sat down the hostess told us our waitress would be with us shortly and almost 25 minutes went by and no one showed up. Yet we saw multiple staff members just staring at us even managers but yet no one offered us a drink or even bother with us at all. This is by far the worst experience yet. And worst of all Grampa was mostly disappointed. I will not be coming back to this place. Stacked get your act together for costumers sake.</Review>< date>

<text>Went in for Breakfast had not been in for  long time.First it does seem not legal that prices are not on menus so when you order you have no way of knowing what your paying and the person taking it does not even tell you ! Your now Gambling on how much it's going to cost you!! Also when I went in before a while back I Ordered the Pastrami and Hash which was Hashbrowns and Pastrami I loved it! This time I said I wanted Pastrami and Hashbrowns and it was Squared cut potatoes with onion.???I asked the server and explained how it use to come Honestly I ordered it lot that was why I come in and she told me it must of been a special order? Really then why did I order it off the menu and get it with Hashbrowns??? Honesty I don't believe so and other people were sitting around me. Anyway Last time I will ever go in to STACKED!!! Very Very Disappointed also the server could see I did not eat it !! So why Change me for something I did not like or Expect!! My thoughts if you do go in Question Everything Do not think for a second they care about the customer!! No Prices on Menu ! Do not even tell you how much it's going to be After you Order!! IS That Even Legal???<//text>< Date>

<review>Always great fun at Stacked with the custom ordering on the iPads. So easy to get exactly what you want, know the price with each item addition and subtraction, and the calorie count as well. And the food is great to boot! The Cow in the Garden salad is amazing, and, if you have room after your meal, I highly recommend a custom shake--thick, rich and delicious.<//review><Name>Laura Pickett</Name>< Date>

<Review>We arrived at about 10 am, there were about 6 tops seated, we were seated at the booths by the bar. Which meant our waitress was the bartender. Which is all good and well but it took about seven minutes to get a coffee from a carafe that had probably had the pot in it for about an hour as it was only  really luke warm by the 2nd cup it was obvious that no one had made a new pot yet. We waited probably about 30 minutes for two breakfast plates that consist of eggs bacon and hash browns. I ordered a breakfast burrito. When the food came it was cold.There’s no real reason for that considering there was only about six tables and it was 10 AM so the bar wasn’t full. Nor was the kitchen that busy because most people already had their food. You can tell when a burrito is cool because the cheese is no longer stringy and has been melted but yet has a greasy look to it because it’s back to a solid-state. I took one bite. My boyfriend said let me know if it’s cold because if it is we are leaving. I asked why he said that and he said because my food is cold my Canadian bacon is overcooked and there is nothing really tasty on the plate. I took a bite of his eggs they were ice cold had been sitting obviously long enough to get that way because it doesn’t take long for eggs to get cold on a plate. When your breakfast plate cost $15 apiece your coffee is cold and you wait 30 minutes in a not so busy restaurant
It literally does not leave you with a good taste in your mouth. If it takes that long to get breakfast in a place with only six tables seated I can’t imagine what it’s like when they are actually busy. It was disappointing because we have been wanting to try this place for months and now we will not return.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dd26685c762929:0x86eba84563d31ad2< /gmap_id><user_name>Moving Boxes</user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>So this was my first time going here. Their menu is probably the worst menu you could ever order from. There are no prices on any of the items. You are pretty much ordering food not knowing the cost. You "stack" other add-ons to your burger or burrito at an additional cost, again not knowing the cost for anything. At the end of it all you are servered small portions and only a little bit of each additional "stacked" item. After asking for the bill or check as it is called... You will be absolutely surprised that your 500 calorie burger or half pound meal costs you more than $18 (without a soda) and only 1 item being "stacked". The food wasnt even beyond good as you might think for the price. You are better off going to another sitdown burger place like island's unfortunately. Unless of course you got a gift card like I did and decide to try this place out be my guest. I did enjoy the food, but based on quality, size, and costs I wont being going back here unless they update their menu with pricing and not just making it up as they go.

P.s. I am not going to ask the waiter how much  everything is on the menu and spend 30mins just having her or him tell me the price per item.

Btw, this is a casual restaurant not high end so not disclosing pricing is subject to question and accountability. Even places that have $100 plates have no problem displaying the prices.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1583172500159, 'text': 'Thank you very much for you feedback.

We felt this would cause a great deal of frustration and confusion for our guests.\n\nI am glad you enjoy ed the food, and hope you will give us another chance knowing that every price is located on the iPad and you are able to see the prices go up or down as you create your masterpiece.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNanette'}< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd26685c762929:0x86eba84563d31ad2<//gmapID></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>A weekend and I ordered 2 drinks which took more than 15 minutes per drink to make AND made without the Vodka which it was called for. Holiday weekend so it wasn't very busy surprisingly...bartender and waitress did not appear to be seasoned employees. There were about 10 people at the bar. Very disappointing although the bartender did say she would remake it...but she didn't know that Vodka was a main ingredient of a Moscow Mule?! That was concerning to me. Can't speak on the food as I didn't order any. Would not recommend this place unfortunately.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1567518625021, 'text': 'Lucy - I am so sorry that it took so long to get your drinks and that your Moscow Mule was not prepared properly.

This place is great. Maddy was our server and she was tremendously helpful. Always there when we needed her, but not hovering. The food was tasty and prepared just right. We had salad, hamburgers, chicken strips, and flat bread and it was all good. Nice selection of craft beer too. We will be back.<//Review>

Decent place with a pretty good drink/food selection....wasnt crazy about the ipad ordering system even though the wait staff is happy to assist.  Id be just as happy driving through in-n-out for a double double animal style.</review>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>Good burger albeit pricey. I always get the nachos and cocktails when I come here. I love the ordering pad and the waiter/waitress are always friendly and provide quick service.

Their food is average but taste clean. The Huntington Beach location also have breakfast burritos on the menu which is surprisingly great.

I come here for the moderate music level and ambient. Don't expect the best tasting food when you come here.

I recommend ordering long island ice tea if you are looking to get your drinks on.</Review>< pics>

Had the pastrami burger which was good sized and delicious. Food is ordered a la carte. For example, if you order a burger it does not come with any sides, you have to order a separately priced side, like fries.

<Text>I've been here a few times and the food is always really tasty but a little bit overpriced unless you're there for happy hour the desserts and the shakes are extremely yummy. I would just advise to stay away from the gluten free tortillas because they are kind of gummy. Try the lobster mac n cheese if you want something really delicious. They also have a pretty nice selection of beers in tap. The atmosphere is very chill and open.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dd26685c762929:0x86eba84563d31ad2< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great burgers. Ordering is really easy with the little touch screen that they give you. Once you're done eating you can even pay and then print your receipt. When I got print the girl came by with the receipt so fast it made my head spin.

Really good food. Love the plethora of options for my burger. However, you are definitely paying a premium for the quality of food and service. $10+ for a burger (a darn good one) with no sides.< /text>

Fabulous tailor to suit burgers and other foods.....delicious desserts, quality food at good prices. Great service, quick and with a smile. Enjoy the atmosphere!

Not so keen on table top kiosk for offering. Does not add to experience! Much prefer personal service!

Scrummy experience....go!</Review>

This place is amazing. Awesome decor and great food. Mac and cheese is amazing! Did you know they cater and deliver?! What more could you ask for. Went here for Ambassador meeting for the hb chamber of commerce meeting. We even got a picture with the owner. How cool is that! 😎👍<//Review>

An interesting concept where you use an iPad to build your own burgers, salads, etc. For every item you add/remove you can see the cost increase/decrease. The service was friendly and the decor was nice.

In practice it took too long for our party to place an order because not every possible option was programmed into the software and we had to get help with a couple items. The food itself was fine but the ordering experience was a bit frustrating and makes me not want to return.

There is an option for the waiter to take your order but you have no idea how much everything costs because the physical menus have no prices.<//text>

We have visited here numerous times and everything was suitable enough for repeat visits.  Yesterday the Food was cold.   Plates are expensive.  They stopped carrying Chilaquiles which is my wife's favorite.   After this last visit yesterday we will likely never return.   The concept of the restaurant is a decent one but when you spend $35 for 2 meals and it is not even cooked....< /Text>

<Review>This place was great in terms of food and drinks and atmosphere. I feel like 3 stars might be a little harsh but the ordering process is confusing some stuff you order on an tablet, others in person. And the biggest thing that I wasnt a fan of was that there isnt any prices listed on their menu. This isnt a 5 star steakhouse. Fix those 2 things and 5 stars< /Review></record></dataset><record>

If you want a personal customized burger, then this is the place for you. There is a tablet on each table that allows the customer to make any burger that they please. As long as you are not against digital ordering this is the most accurate way of getting your order just perfect. I have been there a number of times and it has yet to disappoint me. Everything is reasonably priced and very efficient. The atmosphere is very clean with soft lighting and a open face bar that is perfect for a somewhat outdoor dining experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys their idea of a perfect burger.<//Text>

Excellent food and service!!! My husband ordered the burger with pastrami and said the burger was tasty and the pastrami was excellent, besides being a very generous portion. The chili he tried was just like homemade. My garlic chicken sandwich with avocado was really good and I can still taste the garlic! Also ordered their onion strings and that was great too. Our server Heather was very helpful and it was a pleasure to eat here. We’ll definitely be back when we’re in town. I hope the owners will expand to Sacramento!<//text>

We received a Gift Card from our son for Stacked. We were a party of 4 Adults and 1 Child. We went during Happy Hour. You order from a tablet which for us Old People was a challenge....We all ordered apps. Everything we ordered was delish. Onion Strings, Flatbreads, Kids Sliders, Shakes, Wine was tasty all so. Our bill was $50.00 dollars. Service was spot on. HH is only available in the bar area. Nice open patio to the outside. We all agree that Stacked is a Go Back and will return.<//Text>

I love this place. The food is good and the servers are always really nice. They do lose a half a point because of their iPad system that kind of takes the place of the servers, but it is easy.< /review>

Great wings and burgers. Awesome onion rings. Very respectable beer selection. They even serve breakfast. Only drawback: very busy, sometimes slows service

Service was fast, with the help of the ordering system. You place your order using a tablet. The tablets are at each table. I ordered a bacon cheese burger, it was good. You have to get the sweet potato fries with curry ketchup.< /review>

<review>Always something. The food was good but I waited for over 10 minutes for my iced tea while watching my husband get his beer and be half way done with it. Also ordered a flat bread to come out first for an appetizer. We got everything else and half way through our meal I was talking to the bartender asking her to just take it off our bill, and here comes the appetizer.  Little things like that happen all the time but the food is good so we go back.</review><user>108410531330883314955<//user>< Date>

<Text>Dropped into the restaurant quite accidentally and it just happened to be happy hour. For those who are wondering happy hour runs from 3pm-6:30pm on weekdays and 11am-7pm on Sunday's to the beat of my knowledge but please don't quote me.

I ordered the stone IPA for just $4 for a 16 ounce glass and the chicken tenders for just $5 which are hand breaded breast of chicken.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Though a bit on the pricey side, great place for a good burger.
Stacked recently opened in my area and from the 3 times I've been there I have seen that it consistently gives a good burger among other food items. Their mac and cheese is not too bad either though it can get a bit on the greasy side.
Burgers are substantial but their bun and patty really set it apart from other burger places. Patty is actually cooked rare or medium rare by request.
Also, they offer a good selection of alcoholic drinks.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>So tasty every time we come here. I have never had a bad experience at this location. I am gluten free and love all the options they have. I haven't been for brunch on the weekend yet but I plan to come in soon and try that out. I can't even tell you the last time I had a breakfast burrito, so I'm looking forward to having one when I finally come in for brunch. They don't just have a great food menu though, they also have a bunch of drink options, for the adults, to enjoy. I highly recommend you check this place out if you haven't before. I promise you will be amazed at how easy it is to order (via iPad), and how quickly you get your food! Plus there are so many ways to customize a menu item, or create your very own, that you are sure to be pleased no matter what you order!< /text>< pictures>

Good food, but their iPad ordering system was more hassle than it's worth. We put in special instructions (simple ones like no tomatoes and pickles) and our orders came out with tomatoes and pickles on them.</text>

Family friendly burger joint. Blue cheese burgers, chicken sliders, set potato fries and butter cake (only available at HB location) are the goto orders. The nachos are good alternative to fries too. They got weekly specials that actually are good deals. We even got surprise coupons if you sign up as a member  The self order system is efficient but you still get attentuve servers. We keep coming back. Pro tip: get $100 value gift cards for $75 across the street at Costco.< /review>

My first time, I fully recommend it. My waitress walked me through all the electronic menu options. Totally would go back there again. Food was good ,coffee was very good. Small groups or by yourself.</Text>

< Review>
Nice atmosphere and choice of music. Sat at the bar and was immediately helped. The ordering system was new to me but the bartender was very helpful. During my duration, it was really busy there but only one bartender. (Looked there was two but the other disappeared off to nowhere). Yet, that one bartender, Britney, was awesome and still held down the fort by herself. Huge props to her.</Review>

< Review>
Today's experience fell short of normal expectations. I ordered a promo item: southern fried chicken sandwich and it was beyond salty. I took 2 bites and couldn't continue. Normal burgers and fries my friends ordered were good so it's better to stick with safe items<//Review>

I would say at least 80% on some of the food items......mm bartenders a little preoccupied not like it was when it first opened bartenders were sweet and kind ... NOW you ask for something like ice or water they roll their eyes... They have a great happy hour all day on Sundays Managers very sweet and accommodating and if anything goes wrong<//review>

This place has gone downhill since my last visit a few months ago. Lobster mac and cheese was lacking and dried up and the burger was lukewarm with a soggy bun.  The artichoke dip was good but they didn't give many chips and we had to ask for more. Put your order in fast because service coming out is very slow. Glad I purchased gift cards from Costco. Saved me 20%. Our $100 tab for 3 people was not worth it!</Review>

Good ambiance and decent food. However, if a place specializes in burgers but cooks a burger well-done when it's ordered medium-rare, that's not good.<//Text>

<Text>Eaten at this location twice.. first time was definitely a 4 star experience (would've been 5 but this location does not have pizza and I went there specifically because I'd been craving the mac and cheese pizza).. the good was good, service was great, the server went out of his way to help me find something to fill my mac and cheese pizza craving.  The second visit was barely a 1 star, we spent a fair amount of time just sitting at the table waiting. We were greeted by our server quickly and then waited, ordered an appetizer and waited, ordered food and waited, ordered a drink and waited.. all just a little longer than I find to be normal.  I ordered a salmon burger which was too fishy to eat (I managed 3 bites)  but by the time anyone came to check on us the rest of my group was finished eating so I let it go.  Unfortunately it came back to haunt me later that evening. Not sure if we'll go back or not.  The concept is neat but very inconsistent.</Text>< time>

<Review>Amazing food, tablets at each table make ordering simple. You can also build your own food and drinks, ingredient-by-ingredient. I really liked the beer selection, I just wish the happy hour lasted later.<//Review>< pictures>

$30 for two burgers and a kids pizza. You would think the flavor of the  burgers would be more then BBQ sauce. Not impressed with the food, service , or pricing.<//Review>

I have been here 2x.
First time I got the breakfast it came with eggs and spicey stuff. It was ok. Had acid reflux all day after.

This time I got the margherita pizza. Not very good.
Spinach artichoke dip was ok.

Bloody Mary's were amazingggggggg.
Our server was cool.

Maybe need to step it up with their food. For a $60 bill I expect alot and it just wasnt there. the bloody mary was great but everything else... bleh.< /review>< pictures>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>5<//rating><resp>None</resp><Text>I've been three times and every single time the food was some of the most amazing I've  had. I'm a military veteran with a service dog and I walked in and she looked at me and automatically brushed me to the side that was more outdoor patio. She told me the inside, other side was closed and it was because I had a dog. Then two minutes later I see a younger couple walk in and they walk to the other side that is "closed" and get sat. I nearly became enraged. She was ignorant to the fact that my service dog and me can go wherever we want legally however the reason why I gave this place five stars is because the manager took the server away gave me another one a better one, and even adjusted the bill accordingly and was very nice and sincere not just some used car salesman I'm sorry I'm sorry b*******. But the food is very good, drinks and beer are very good and the service has been above-average. It has seemed to be a very clean place as well.</Text></record>

We were well treated and the variety of menu choices plus food quality & presentation were all good.  But Wow! the prices were a lot higher than one would expect - - especially for Lunch & Breakfast items.   I liked the music & visuals in the restaurant's interior, but have to say that the *value* for my dining-dollars was not good.< /text>

The quality of the food is good, but not superior.  Also, you pay extra for ranch, aoli, etc.  Their garlic fries were "Smart and Final" quality. Finally, get ready to spend at least $100 if you go with a couple of friends (excluding alcohol).</Review>

{'time': 1529345008602, 'text': 'Charles - thanks for visiting STACKED and for your comments.  I am glad you enjoyed your experience at our restaurant.  I understand your concern about prices on the printed menu and I appreciate the opportunity to respond.  We have an ingredient-centric menu, including pricing.  Every ingredient has a value associated with it, so if you remove an ingredient from a signature item, the price goes down (which is unique to STACKED), and if you add an ingredient the price goes up.  Over 95% of our guests modify their meals in some way, so the price they pay is very rarely the price that would be displayed on a paper menu.  We feel that this would cause a lot of confusion for our guests.  The prices are clearly marked on the iPad menu, and guests can see them change as they add or subtract ingredients.  I hope that explanation helps.  Thanks again for visiting STACKED and for your feedback.'}<//Response>

<Review>Good food, fun concept. Only complaint is that you can't see prices without looking at the ordering device of which there is only one on the table. This slows ordering choices when you have 3, 4 or more people at the table. Perhaps the prices for standard items should be on the paper menus?</Review></record>

The service is terrible, I understand that you place your own order on the tablet, so the staff doesn't have to do that, but how about checking up on the table once in a while for drink refills. Food was good but way over priced. For what you pay you shouldn't have to order fries as a side. Booo</Text>

<Text>I love how you completely customize everything! My favorite items are the chili cheese fries, the jalapeño burger and basically all of their burritos!!! My favorite shake is the toasted marshmallow one...but honestly they are all good and VERY thick.

Lastly, the breakfast is AMAZING!!!!! I couldn't stop eating it. I think the pancakes are better than IHOP. Right now Huntington is the only STACKED doing breakfast so hopefully that aspect expands to the other locations as well. Great French toast too!</Text>< Pics>

< review>
I understand this restaurant is trying new style, but I don't like a menu that doesn't show prices. It's new way of ordering "per item" seemed ok, but I don't like having to use an electronic tablet menu. I expect a waiter or waitress to take my order. I don't expect to do it myself.
When I walked in with my party, aftr 8am, on a Saturday, we had to wait
to be seated, because no one was there at entrance, to seat us. We thought they weren't open for business yet.
I won't be going back to this place & I will tell my friends not to bother going here.

P S. This is the 1st time I have given a business 2 stars....</review>

You can order when you want and how you want through their iPad system, even pay when done.  Literally no hassle but you can order traditionally with a server too.  The food is amazing.

<username>Patrick Vogel<//username><Date>1547874229565< /Date><rating>1</rating><Review>My wife and I were excited to try a new restaurant....We are in the area a lot for the local retail, Dick's Sporting Goods, Nordstrom Rack and many others in the immediate area....We have watched the building of the store along with the throngs of people going in and out for the last several months....
Okay, getting to the point....You can have great food...(or in our case mediocre food)....A cool vibe, and decor....Attractive servers and staff.....But having it all is the trick that restaurants have been trying to perfect for many years....Look, there is a reason why In-N-Out only makes essentially three things....
But Stacked is no In-N-Out....and in this spirit that they can not focus on any one area....Super Sad...but this can happen to any new restaurant....
Now going back to our experience, we sat at the bar...We had three young ladies one prettier than the next serving us....But none of them had a clue how to serve or the organizational fortitude to see what was requied and how to insert their services when required....Look, we asked to see a menu....After a few minutes we received menues....We ordered drinks, but waited longer than what is normally required....Remember, we were sitting at the bar....not in some distant obscure both forgotten about...Why ask customers how they want there burger cooked if your not going to cook it in our case medium rare....The burger was cooked well done....This begs the question, why open another restaurant that spends more on decore than training....I get it, a cool looking restaurant always looks good on paper....These are the restaurants that fail....The ones that look good on paper....We all have favorite restaurants that we grew up....None of these restaurants had business plans or lofty goals to take over the food industry....No they had a different plan all together, make a great meal for a stranger and hope they come back....Well Stacked never got that message...And unfortunately did not stack up to this patrons expectations....Remember we all have choices....Do not settle for anything but the best.......<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Incredibly slow service. Difficult to get a waiter when you need something. Kitchen consistently confused orders. Been 3 times and had similar experiences each time, so things are not improving. Quality of food does not match price.</text>

<Review>The whole iPad thing they've got goin on at stacked is really cool. Tells you exactly what you're paying and how many calories it is. We came on Super bowl Sunday and it wasn't too busy. Service was phenomenal, we sat at the bar and we're mostly served by Brent and a bit by Kelly as well. Very quick, friendly, and affordable, especially for the quality of food. 10/10 would recommend.< /Review></record>

The menu is huge... and you can basically create  any of their basics with your own ingredient mix. Fun vibe.< /Text>

Their breakfast was good. We we're honestly the only ones in the restaurant and they seemed to not be ready to open. They were out of ranchero sauce, which comes on the chiliquiles Benedict. We had to share a spoon for our coffees. And we had to flag down a waitress for mimosa refills. While their food is delicious. Not sure I would come back for breakfast. Maybe just stick with lunch/dinner.<//review>

<review>Foods good but no sides. The service is not up to the standard of Denny's. Dishes, empty classes and menus left on the table. The iPad did an awesome job at getting food but not a server. I'll just plug the iPad in as a tip.< /review>< GmapID>

They have several different kinds of burgers on the menu, but it's more fun to build your own on their iPad app and have it come to you.

Pricey, burger was not THAT flavorful for that price, but I liked the options and customization freedom on burgers, burritos and more so there is that. Was STARVING and getting the food took long because we individually ordered on the little computer screen, but if you are quick and just send for an order of fried fast, you wont due</Text>

Fun customizable menu items. Add your favorites, subtract what you don't like!  Good fries. What's not to like? Only mark down is... It's a little bit noisy.< /Review>

Cant go wrong with this place, at least I have yet to create something I dont like, lol. Still not sure why there are waitresses/waiters when everything is done on an iPad. Regardless, I still tip them since most of them check in to see how things are, offer refills and clean plates off the table. Top to bottom, the menu offers a great selection.< /text>

Good food, but their computer ordering system is confusing and inconvenient. I think it was an interesting concept but just doesn't really work that great.< /review>

As for our iPad ordering system, it was developed to enable our guests to customize their meals, choosing between a huge number of ingredients to get exactly what they want.  But, we understand that some of our guests prefer us to take their order for them, and we are very glad to do so.  We just want our guests to have a great dining experience and we will do whatever we can to make that happen.  So, on future visits, please feel free to ask your server to take your order.

First time here.. Very new experience...you can order from ipad on table or waitress can help...we chose the ipad...it was kinda fun to see pics of our choices.. Food was very tasty...kind of cool cause u dont have to look for a server for drink refills. Just enter on ipad and they are right to you...will definitely go again...</Text>

I Ubereats from here pretty frequently.  The food is good and well priced.  Finally popped in to the location by Bella Terra while out shopping with my son.  Was really pleased with the experience.  Nice laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, but almost no need to interact with them.  All ordering is done from an iPad on your table.  You can customize exactly what you want-and as a vegan eating out with a non vegan 6 year old that’s very helpful.  In the middle of the meal I decided I wanted a soda- couple taps on the screen and 30 seconds later and I had a soda.  Oh- and they do Ubereats to the park.  I’ve used them for amazing picnics on several occasions.< /text>

< review>
We love stacked.  Normally it is always a five star.  Last night we received a fried egg that was well done on our burger.  This was the second time in a week that this has happened in the last week at the Huntington Beach store.  After eating a meal size salad we had to ask for our burger because it hadn't been brought back.  A bit of training needs to happen for the staff on Wednesday nights.  Other than the two egg incidences we have never had a problem at Stacked.  We love their food.  Both my husband and I are gluten free and grain free.  Hubs is also milk free.  Most of the menu at stacked accommodates our dietary restrictions.

I had lunch at the stacked in Cerritos with a friend 3 days ago.  The food was just as good as our normal H.B. store.  The atmosphere was not as fun as Huntington Beach.  The Cerritos store was a bit dark and the music wasn't as lively compared to Huntington.  The wait staff was excellent.  As I said above we love eating at Stacked.  We are in California 4-5 months a year and Stacked is our go to restaurant over all others.< /review>

<time>1497462788792< /time><rating>4<//rating><Text>I was really excited to try this place once I found out about its concept. What blew me away even more what the ambiance and indoor/outdoor theme they really blended well. For HB - this was a totally cool way to capture hanging out with friends, with an ice cold beer and a burger.

We popped in for lunch on Friday. We sat on the high tops near the patio and enjoyed the nice breeze. The concept is you order your food/drinks from the iPad and it gets delivered to your table as soon as it's ready. When your ready to pay, you can simply swipe your credit card on the ipad device and you're outta there in a hot min!

The food was amazing. Build your own burgers, or try a fun spin on their popular ready made menu items. Great food, great beers, great service.

You've got us hooked!!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The concept is that you order everything through an iPad to even check out the food comes out so quickly and gets customize everything to it to you customize your burgers or mac and cheese or burrito even your ice cream sandwich or Sunday it is the coolest place ever super futuristic super delicious and even the decor is awesome it's a smaller restaurant but they were managed to fit bunch of seating without making it feel crowded great for groups or even if they died or even your family amazing</Text>< resp>

eh. It's kind of like purgatory... not that good, but not that bad either. Had to order my drink twice and still didn't get it until over halfway through my meal. Burger was okay. Staff was friendly. The iPad order system is more of a gimmick that they depend on to get patronage. I will try again, but will lower my expectations</Text>

Had to ask twice for our drinks. No one explained the ordering system. Worst breakfast ever. Ordered egg over med. and whites were runny plus grain papancakes were raw in the middle. Was not worth the price.< /review>

<Text>Breakfast was cold
Eegs were burnt
Waitress never asked how the food was.
Filled out the form that asked how our experience was with our dissatisfaction.
Got a quick response from the manager apologizing and stating he had already talked to the staff and cooks
He also emailed me and asked for my mailing address because he was going to mail me a coupon for my next visit.
I emailed a week later letting him know I never received anything inthe mail.
Never heard back.  That was a month ago.
Don't go there. It's a colossal disappointment from all angles.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Updated diner style place. Food is mediocre. There is a screen sitting on the table  but to order the waiter just takes your order by hand...kind of weird< /Review>< pictures>

Service was good, you can use their tablet ipad to make your order or have the server do it for you! Food was soo good, I'm a big guy never get full but this food was soo hardy and delicious that I couldnt finish my burrito.  Came here before going back to AZ and Im glad to write the review for this place because it is amazing!! AZ needs more places like this! Atmosphere is cool and inviting, opened bar wall lets the cool Cali breeze air come in decor is awesome too!!!</text>

<review>Chocolate Chunk Brownie ($8.70 as stacked) is topped with double fudge brownie ice cream, toasted coconut, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, peanut butter sauce, and whipped cream. This is a rich and heavy dessert, yet decadent. The brownie itself is not too dense and hot and gooey right out of the oven. The peanut butter flavor from the sauce and Reese’s pairs nicely with the uber chocolate flavors. Peanut butter plus chocolate equals onolicious! This is definitely a dessert for the chocoholic in your life, like my hubby! Rating: 5/5

Butter Cake ($10.55 as stacked) is topped with strawberry ice cream, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, almonds, and whipped cream. The butter cake reminds me of pound cake in texture and holds up to any topping you pile on it. It has a neutral taste so you can go to any “flavortown” you please from fruit to chocolate. I personally loved it with the berries. Their natural sweetness and tanginess bring out the vanilla in the cake. As the strawberry ice cream starts to melt, it turns into a sauce that lends more moisture to the cake. I would really love to see this option on the permanent menu!!! Rating: 5/5

Pumpkin Bread Pudding ($7.75 as stacked) is topped with banana, strawberries, strawberry sauce, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, almonds, and whipped cream. If you are a pumpkin lover like I am, you’ll love this bread pudding. It has a nice pumpkin pie flavor from the nutmeg and cinnamon. I went a little overboard on the toppings and would keep it more minimal next time with more neutral flavors; maybe with just the caramel sauce, almonds, and whipped cream.

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Good food but not good enough for the price, in my opinion.

PRICING: Everything is priced a la carte and you build ("stack") your order, with each component being an additional charge. To get something really gourmet and special, you'll easily be looking at $11.50 for the burger *alone*, no sides.

PORTIONS: The burger was at least a decent size. The side of fries was small. My simple 4 ingredient salad was smaller than anything I've ever had at a restaurant. The meat portion was good, but the salad was even smaller than what many restaurants call a "petite" version.

FOOD TASTE & QUALITY:  Don't get me wrong, the burger was delicious. Juicy and flavorful. The garlic parmesan fries were tasty, but quite oily at the bottom. The steak salad was... MEH.

SERVICE:  You can have them give you standard table service, but it really is better geared to place your order on the table-side iPads. "Stacking" your order is easier if you do it, than trying to have the wait staff hear you in the very loud environment. It's kind of cool. They were pretty efficient with everything, but it does seem to leave an element of confusion to the service. Everyone helps all tables, it seems, so the lack of delegation meant sometimes I was passed without drinks refilled, but random staff did pop in to check on us. The chaos is distracting. I'd rather have staff you know I'm their responsibility, rather than have every other worker interrupt my lunch to see if I'm taken care of.

Bottom line, I just can't see paying these prices for this service and quality.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>
