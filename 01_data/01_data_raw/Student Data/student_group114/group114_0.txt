My wife Nicole was taken to this hospital and they probably saved her life! She said they were the best team she could have had in her situation. They gave her excellent care and I thank them for taking such good care of my wife!< /text>

I was there 2 days ago I was trying to see labor and deliver due to my ob saying I had to go in and they made me sit outside in the cold for 2 hours before allowing me to be seen by triage.
Afyer that is when the real issue happened. The er doctor was cold, would not let me get a sentence out and he kept cutting me off and when I denied to take the meds he wanted me to due to birth defect risks he insisted the meds k was already on would cause birth defects. I called my ob and she said that is completely false. However for a doctor to say that false statement as he leave the room as a jab is completely wrong. It has be second guessing If i am even wanting to ever go back. If there was not options to travel for medical care I'd be lost.< /text>< Resp>

If you have to go here. And I mean have to.... then this might be a good place other wise if you know your going to live for a least a few more hours, go anywhere but here. In fact if you have to go here because its the only place you can go. Look up your local mortuary and go there. Just cut out the middle man. Would give this place 0 or negative stars if such things existed. Just don't go here... Covid 19 is safer than this place...< /Text>

I don’t recommend this hospital, rude nurses, poor slow service. I had a friend of the family’s son who died at this hospital due to poor And under educated care so when the mom of the son was in a car accident the ambulance was going to take her to this hospital because it’s in their district but she said absolutely not and refused to go to mad river. So I hate to say it but even if I was extremely hurt I’d take the chances and spend an extra 15 mins to make it to Saint Josephs in Eureka...I’d give it zero stars if I could.<//Text>

<text>I went there on Tuesday because I suffer from cyclical vomiting syndrome and I was in bad shape. Whole body was cramped, I had the chills, I threw up 5 different times waiting for my call. Lead Nurse Keith is probable the rudest health care worker I have ever spoken to. When he asked what St. Joseph's did to help me last time, he laughed at my response and said, "I highly doubt that". There were 3 other people when I arrived, and 2 more after I got there. Every one of them was seen before me... I ended up leaving after 2 hours because I was actually on death's door and went to St. Joseph's where I was treated with respect and actual help. What kind of "professionals" are these people? Please, never go here.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Worst hospital in existence. Emergency room wait time in excess of at least 6 hours each time, the billing department is terrible, and they misdiagnosed a broken wrist telling me it was my elbow.

I received medical attention in 2015 for my wrist. They told me my elbow was broken and put a cast on that left my wrist exposed. Came back weeks later because my wrist was still hurting. The doctor said “oh actually it’s your wrist that’s broken, not your elbow.” I have no clue how anyone would confuse the two.

5 years later in 2020 I get a faulty bill from a collections agency for this visit. No mail or calls or anything within the whole 5 years. Just $60 bill that couldn’t be explained but was reversed upon my questioning<//review><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x54d1575285115d49:0x33c0b71780393b45< /GmapID>< username>

I’ve had to take my son to the ER here twice and my daughter once.  The first time my son had split his forehead open.  We drove for an hour and then checked into emergency.  We went into triage and the nurse could see he was hurt but in good spirits and not bleeding substantially.  We waited for a couple minutes and were taken back to a room which was clean and had several people come in to decide between stitches and glue after he had a good cleaning and was checked out for a concussion or deep injuries.  After the cut was closed up, which seemed pretty much painless for him, we were sent on our way.  Overall a good experience and all staff was on point.
The second experience at Mad River Hospital was also pleasant.  We came into the ER to have our son and daughter looked at for a rash that popped up really quickly.  We were seen in triage  as soon as we walked in.  After waiting for 10-15 mins we were taken back to a room to have the kiddos checked out.  Several nurses came and checked them out to get a few opinions as there are a lot of unvaccinated people in the community and there were several possibilities as to what they thought could be wrong.  They decided to do a throat swab to check for strep and that’s what it turned out to be.  We don’t usually like to go to the ER for stuff like this but it would’ve taken weeks to get an appointment somewhere else.  Both times we’ve had to take our kids in the staff has been friendly and professional.  They made sure to take all the necessary steps to ensure our kids were getting the care they needed.  Recommended.< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>My experiences with this hospital have been direspectful, unethical, and frankly immoral at best. Nurses and doctors have disregarded the safety of staff around them, food staff has been neglected and underpaid, under-resourced and under-appreciated consistently since the COVID19 breakout, hazard pay is non-existent for any and all staff members working within the facility, which is a blatant attempt to save money at the cost of lives (thereby applying a mometary value on a human life *at a hospital*), and the rumours of patients being falsely tested negative for COVID19 being sent back home only to later discover they were incorrectly tested and recognised that they were, in fact, positive for COVID19 are less of a rumour and more of a crisis. This hospital needs better support from without and within if it wishes to keep the title of hospital any longer, or it will soon become a graveyard due to the lack of safety precautions taken. I *strongly* urge anyone with family here to consider transferring to a different hospital, I would say any hospital would be better but in these times maybe this is the case in many "locally owned hospitals".<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Went to the ER and right from the start I could already tell the employees don't care. They guy that took my information down seemed like he didn't want to be there. The nurse was laughing at me. The doctor did not seem to care and just wanted me gone. Shut the place down or get more competent and caring workers. All the employees should care about every patient equally considering the career path they all took.< /Review>

They don't support anything in the community and have very little public 'face'; they could use some good PR! But the staff is dedicated and kind. I had a very bad experience with Dr. Hackett when I was giving birth - he refused to come in when he was on call, despite the nurses calling him repeatedly, and is just basically a misogynist, and a very poor doctor. Ladies, if you are going to give birth there, make SURE he is not anywhere near your labor! As long as you can avoid him, the staff is wonderful. Just be sure to encourage the administration to support the staff and consider being involved in the local community!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They made treating a serious injury into a somewhat pleasant experience.  Everyone was super friendly and made me feel much safer.  Most importantly they were the only hospital open at 8:00, so who knows where I’d be if I just waited until morning.

Changed from 5 star to 1 star when the bill came back as nearly $7,000 dollars.  7,000 FOR A CAT SCAN AND BLOOD TEST AND I WASN'T EVEN OVERNIGHT!!!  I WISH I WOULD HAVE JUST DIED!!  And it turns out it was just a bruised kidney so I would have been fine anyways!</Review>< pics>

<Text>With my doctor's advice ,whent there special X Ray's  to better my way of living ,only to have someone making a decision on my doctor's behalf ,wen I questioned why they didn't do what was in the order ,I was given a excuse ,and to be told have a nice day. When I called to complain  again different excuses from different people.  Ido not trust or recommend this establishment to anyone nore I trust their dicitions ,but only feel sad for the elderly that have to go there and won't complain.Raydiolagy made a call on the behalf of my doctor's advice ,you are not my doctor and you should stick to your job,you interupted the way that I could have to better my way of living,instead you found a way for a nother paying visit.(that's how l feel ). Mad River hospital is not what it use to be ,carring and loving,I am sad that I have to persue this because there are employees there that I know. I will not go there again even in a emergency  (unless you improve),I will take the chances somewhere else and I do not recommend it to anyone else , unless you want to be treated like another number,( NEXT PlEASE) they are not proffetionals but rude instead. The reason to go there is to improve someones else's life ,not for you to play God ,  and think you know  what is best because you think that you are in a position to do so, again YOU ARE NOT MY DOCTOR and I never gave you permission to intrude in my health .You are lucky to even get one star.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>5 stitches cost $5,000. I cut my hand at night after the urgent cares in the area had closed and I was worried that waiting until the morning to go to urgent care might cause infection/further damage. If I had known it would cost this much I would have risked it. Especially because when I got to Mad River there was only one doctor on staff, so I had to wait for 6 hours to be seen, defeating the purpose.

I've called to ask for a breakdown of my bill twice, one of those times the person I talked in the patient accounts department was completely rude and condescending. It was very clear she did not intend to help me or answer my questions. I went in to ask questions in person and fortunately  met with someone much nicer. She told me I could file a complaint form and the hospital would investigate my case. So I filed the form and got a letter back that did not answer my questions or address my concerns, ignoring every specific point I made in my initial inquiry.

Also the hospital's online bill pay site is really really sketchy. The general appearance, the word "donate" in the address, and the lack of terms/conditions gives me no confidence in the site. I am absolutely not going to type my credit card number into it.</review>< Pictures>

If Mad River is your only option I’m sorry. Expect wait times to be long. I waited over 4 hours in pain laying on the ER gurney in the middle of the night-early morning. During which time I had to explain what a hot water bottle is to my nurse because he had no idea what it was. When the Dr finally showed up he gave the classic excuse that he has other patients. (He’s the only ER doctor I’ve seen there) He was incredibly dismissive of what I was telling him. When he asked which medication help me and I told him he called me a drug seeker.  He then administer a shot for nausea and 2 bags of fluids then discharged me.

<review>My daughter went into ER on Wednesday. She was diagnosed with Mono with an Enlarged Spleen. she was treated and released with instructions to rest.  She was given a do not return to work for the remainder if the week note from the Doctor. She was also instructed that if she didn't feel better or if she felt worse after the three days.return to the ER.  After three days she felt worse and had difficulty breathing, so she returned to ER there she met Dr? Tuan Luu. Who conducted an ultrasound and informed her that her spleen has grown in size , but had not protruded through the ribcage.  Clearly her condition had not improved , but had gotten worse. One would conclude that returning to work would not be in her best interest. But Dr Luu refused to give her a not to return to work note.   Simply stating that she could return to work.  She informed him that she works in a very physically challenging environment. but the Dr.  Still refused and went to write the discharge papers.   As my daughter.was waiting for the papers.she again mentioned her breathing difficulties and wanted to speak with the Dr. again. The nurse refused her request and merely states ”the Dr said that you were able to return to work so you are fine.”   This is how a facility who's main purpose is to treat patients with care, compassion and professionalism must have missed that memo.<//review>< Pics>

<review>This hospital is a danger to society. I was left in an unstaffed ER waiting room for 4 hours (not a single patient waiting ahead of me) in life threaten condition. The same thing happened to my grandma with an open head wound. We stressed the fact that she was on blood thinners and has a head injury and it took 7 HOURS BEFORE ANYONE EVEN ADDRESSED HER. After being released all her stitches came apart and we finally went to saint josephs.  Calling this death trap a hospital is dangerous to society and everyone who might mistakenly go there. Just. Don’t.< /review><date>1564524091333< /date><UserId.>103014539051823673241<//UserId.>< Resp>

<Review>Had a 4 day stay here when I had a bowel obstruction. I was treated with care, the nurses kept me in high spirits, and I felt very looked after. Competent staff and comfortable rooms. The emergency room can be a little slow but overall, my experience staying here felt very homey and Surrena was a fantastic nurse. Very knowledgeable and comforting. Also got a free goodie bag.</Review>< Time>

<text>Went to them Friday the 12th, had ultra sound done to look for broken ribs or bleeding liver, said the results would be in Tuesday to our doctor. Called doctors office Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning before calling hospital and asking them where it is?!? They informed us that they had not sent the image to the doctors office and they would not give us the results. WTH?!? As it is the technician asked what happened and when we told her she said yeah that could be it or something else. Why even tell us anything?!? Very frustrating</text><resp>{'time': 1564531839284, 'text': 'I am sorry for the delay in responding to you. It is important to us to remedy issues that  you may have had.

<review>I had an amazing experience with Mariel Bosserman, NP,  until I called the clinic one day and found out that she was laid off.  I was shocked and then angry.  Why in the world would Mad River lay off such a dedicated and exceptional employee?? She may not be a doctor, but she is hands on the BEST "doctor" that I have seen.  I am not from Humboldt and moved here a couple of years ago.  Prior doctors and/or internists that I was a patient of were all from great hospitals or private practice and all were great.  That being said, Bosserman, was even better.  How sad and confusing, that Mad River chose to lay off such a competent, caring medical practitioner in an environment where they are sorely lacking.  I hope she finds a position locally so that I can switch to where ever she is working.  I am thoroughly disgusted and am giving a 1 star based on this asinine action.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><date>1551393542199<//date>< username>

< review>
Worst experience at an ER EVER!  I am extremely ill and was there just to put a gown on and have Dr Luu tell me he couldn’t help me. He was extremely rude and dismissive and should be fired based on how many patients have had so many similar experiences. I put my clothes on to leave, but they made sure to get my ID and insurance info before I left so they can send me a ginormous bill for NOTHING! I left that place bawling and will never return. It’s sad because I was born at this hospital and birthed two of my babies there. I refuse to pay for this experience and plan to report it. Absolutely unconscionable!
Edit to add: the nurse who checked me in was really nice, listened and showed compassion.
***2nd Edit to add: I don’t know what the response below is about. I haven’t been contacted or spoken to anyone from Mad River about this. Perhaps they mean that they intend to call me?***<//review>

Just went to get X-Rays from two different doctors-hips and knees. I chose to walk-in instead of schedule an appointment. I left my house  (7min drive) at 1:05 and was back in my car at 1:40. Michelle at Admitting was quick, professional but funny--exactly who you want no matter what procedure you are checking in for (I give her 8☆'s). Then, I brought my papers back to Radiology-Again fast and friendly! I sat down to pull out my phone for the wait and hadn't even unlocked my screen before my X-Ray man came to fetch me. He was fantastic as well! Commenting on my Joan Jett concert Tshirt, we talked about how great she was, when I recently was right in front of her as she rocked it. He got my films done in record time and made a suggestion for repositioning me, to save me an extra $hot.
The entire experience was excellent and I left the hospital smiling and eager to let the Google world know what a great experience I had! I was run over by a drunk driver in a truck, so I have had many hospital visits since 1995, this was a great one!!
Thanks to everyone who helped me today. It was faster than ordering a pizza from Domino's and almost as satisfying.<//Text>

Do not trust the emergency room Dr. My husband would be dead today if it wasn't for the V A. He was missed diagnosed. He was flown out of St.Jo's 2 days later. Not for C O P D but a COLLAPSED HEART valve. No stars for the E.R.        The hospital itself is great!  Wish I could rate them both. The E R is bad, but I have good things to say about Hospital.<//review>

Came to ER very sick and had to stay for three weeks, the staff here took very good care of me and the facility was clean and best of all the food was not aweful. I would come here over st. Joes for the fact that the staff here where much less corporate feeling and more warm and compassionate. Can’t stress enough how wonderful the staff are here, they seemed to all be happy to be working the jobs they had even housekeeping was pleasant. Thank you all.<//Review>

< review>
I recently went to the hospital for a foot problem. The nurse saw me and I went to the waiting room to wait as there were sicker people who needed to be seen. What I witnessed then was a collection of incredibly entitled, whining people waiting to be seen. The only relief for me was when they were taken in to be seen BEFORE ME! When it was my turn, I was seen and even received the services of a surgeon. At the end of the day I got antibiotics but the only pain relief I needed was relief from the whiny, morons in the waiting room. Of course I’ll return if I ever need medical care again.< /review>

There needs to be two reviews here, a five-star review for the nursing staff.  They were compassionate, sensitive to the indignities inherent in the procedure I was having, and they took outstanding care of me.

However, their billing department lacks competence, which could be costly if you don't know how to manage your own billing problems.  In January I had a screening test.  They billed it as if it were a diagnostic procedure.  The difference is clear, and very well spelled out in numerous sources.  One of those is the American Gastroenterological Association.  In my former life prior to grad school, I was a medical biller and know something about those codes and their uses.  In terms of direct effect on my wallet, they wanted over $800 they weren't owed.

The billing guidelines very clearly differentiate screening from diagnostic procedures, and the reimbursement differs between the two.  I figured it was a simple fix. Send them the guidelines, they'd fix the error.  After all,  not only are there numerous sources related to this common problem, but my insurance company and my physician agreed that the procedure was screening and not diagnostic.  Even after multiple letters to the billing department and the "patient experience officer", Mad River refused to re-bill, failed to provide their rationale for their billing, and threatened to send me to collections over the co-pay and deductible I didn't owe as those fees don't apply to preventative care.

I finally submitted an appeal directly to my insurance company to change the original billing, and they agreed. This is a common error, and one I assumed they'd correct once they were presented with the evidence.

If you are scheduled there for your middle-aged screening poke-n-prod,  know you're entitled to have that billed as preventative, which means you DO NOT OWE a deductible or co-pay with most insurance plans.  One way  you might be able to help yourself here is to make sure the word "screening" is written on the consent form for the procedure.<//review>

<Review>My expecting wife called ahead looking for an ultra sound quote.  She explained we didn't have insurance and that we would pay cash at the time of the visit.. They told her they would give her a discount if paying cash which would make the TOTAL cost $207.20. So she decided to make the appointment and paid for the visit before she had the ultra sound.. Skip to two weeks ahead and we now have a bill for $181 to be paid to Redwood Radiology Inc.. What happened here??? Double billed? So when she calls them to straighten it out they tell her that the $207.20 was just a "facility fee".. Ridiculous and dishonest!!! How the heck does the facility fee cost more than the actual service?? Redwood Radiology was willing to discount the $181 down to $126.70 But Mad River so far won't budge. If she had known this she would NOT have made the appointment to begin with. Also the nurse who gave the ultra sound was cold and unpleasant.. We will never go there again for any reason.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
I was admitted around 9 pm on a Sunday night.  The male nurse blew out two veins in my right arm after I told him my left arm was the arm most commonly used.  He told me it was closer to the IV machine.  I dripped blood on the bed, my gown, and on the floor. Then he very roughly used my left arm. It worked. Go figure.  Dr Luu came in looking very angry.  I explained my pain.  He got a portable ultra sound machine and checked my abdomen.  Calling it a crappy machine, I was sent for x-rays of my belly.  Luu then told me that I had "a lot of stool in there."  I told him I had not been constipated and did not know why I had this accumulation of stool.  I was very frustrated.  He claimed that my uterine fibroid was pinching the bowel and that I just needed to use some laxatives to clear it out.  "We see people like you every night," said the rude Luu.  He asked if I wanted a CAT Scan but cautioned me that they "cause cancer."  I was quite upset, having lost my mother to cancer.  I asked to have privacy to talk to my daughter and husband who were in the room with me.  I reluctantly decided to go see a primary care physician before I ordered a CAT Scan (which I did two days later and had an MRI).  Luu sent in the nurse who told us that the "doctor" had sent him in to get my decision (chicken to face my family).  Luu is rude, uninformed, and just wants to get you out of the ER.  I was humiliated to be told that I just needed a laxative and move my bowels.  I have since taken my case to UCSF, and I am still undergoing tests. This so called Dr. Luu has ZERO bedside manner, and the nurse was just as horrible.  NEVER NEVER will I go to the Mad River ER again.< /review>

<Review>My mother was transported to this hospital, where she died. I was denied my right to see my mother, even after showing propper identification proving relation, including my birth certificate from Mad River Community Hospital. After filing a complaint with Guest Relations Manager Pamela Floyd, I was told my medical records and visit history were shredded, deleted from the Hospital's system. I had set a date to speak to Pamela Floyd in person over the phone, when I called I had discovered my phone number had been blocked from calling the hospital.<//Review>< pictures>

<rating>2</rating><review>I went in around 3 am due to puking and intense gut pain. Around 4, i was given 2 shots of morhpine to help with the pain. I was NEVER asked if I had any issues with it or even what kind of pain killers I've used in the past. I hate taking pain killers as my body hurts for a reason, best to figure out why. So the strongest pain killer I have ever taken at that point was a normal strength Advil. So it's only until after the fact that I figured out that the reason the heart monitor machine was screeching every time I started to drift asleep was because my blood pressure plummeted and stayed like that.

They had me drink a liquid so that they could do a cat scan, even though I couldn't even keep water down. I was told it would be alright, just try my best. So I did and was quite proud of myself, but when the lady who was to run the scans showed up, I puked then and there. She was utterly disgusted with me which was understandable because she did see me just puke. I apologized on the spot and tried explaining why it happened and that I tried my best, but she wheeled me away to where the machine was, not really saying much. The alternative was to use the iv to get the fluids in me. I've administered an iv to my dad before and so I know how it's supposed to go. Instead of easing the fluid in, she pressed as hard as she could to rush the process along, even though I told her it felt horrible. She told me that I needed to be absolutely still in the machine or we would have to do it again. Being as still as I could, it only took one round of scans before I was wheeled back to where I had spent the last few hours.

After numerous tests, they figured out my gallbladder was a traitor and had to go asap. So by 8:30 am, they were wheeling me into surgery.

The surgery presumably went well? I'm here, so that's something.

Two days of hospitalization go by without any food or water. When I asked about getting just a sip of water, I was told by nurses that it wasn't needed because that's why I had the iv. I could have some paste to moisten my mouth or if I was good, I could get a few ice chips. When I asked if I could have some Advil for the pain in my gut, I was told no. The pain was just due to leftover gas in my gut from the surgery and I just needed to fart and it would be fine. When asking about food, I was told because my gut wasn't making sounds, I wasn't allowed to. Why don't I walk around, that'll help. So, weak as I was, every few hours, I'd walk around the hospital in a hospital gown, leaning on an iv stand as the iv is still in my arm. Nevermind the fact that I had four incisions on the outside of my belly and at least another two inside me. Not to mention constantly being awoken to have my bodily stats checked, so that also very much sucked.

The third day, I was brought food. Even though I told them I was lactose intolerant, they kept trying to give me coffee (even though I'm sensitive to caffeine), creamer for said coffee, milk, an ice cream and a small chunk nasty jello. I even had an argument with a nurse as to if an ice cream bar has dairy in it and if it did, what the side effects would be if I had even a nibble of it.

I don't remember her name, but there was ONE nurse who actually cared. She brought me an entire glass of ice chips as an apology for not doing the every three hour check up due to there having been an emergency in that wing. I was overjoyed that I was able to get some sleep in. She'd ask how I felt. She'd try to cheer me up. Hell, she asked why I was walking and offered to walk with me so I wouldn't be alone. She was that ear who would listen to what her coworkers were doing and try to make matters better. She was the ONE nurse who gave me an Advil for the pain. Unfortunately, she her days off where mostly on when I was there. She was utterly amazing.

On the fourth day, the surgeon told me not to be a hero (for going without pain killers) and pulled out the STAPLES.

They saved my life 2 years ago. Pretty sure they left something metal in me though. Metal detectors now hate me.<//review>< pics>

I have been here since 11pm when i walked in it was ghost town. No medical personnel on site no security just people roaming around in pain. After waiting 5 hours i went to check the status of me being seen and the older short heavy set man  triage nurse was rude and short and slammed the door in my face and said it will be another 4 to 6 hours before im seen. When i asked him why he was so rude he said i could go somewhere else. Medical personnel are suppose to have empathy but clearly mad river doesnt require that from there employees. If your ill do not come here you will treated poor if your ever get treated at all. This place needs new management fast. I feel so bad for the 80 year old waiting here with me he's been here since 9 and he's not in good shape  at all mad river u SHOULD be ashamed to be in the medical field<//Text>

They have literally saved my life twice.

I was turned away from St Joe's because they thought I was an addict looking for pain meds. Curse that adult acne.

Mad River caught that it was a blocked kidney because they believed the pain beyond my pizza face.< /review>

<Text>I had an allergic reaction to penicillin and my lip had swelled up,  so I went to Mad River emergency for care.  They offered me a Benedryl, but I had taken one before leaving home,  then they attempted to give me intravenous steroids to counteract the swelling.  After two attempts,  which made me feel as if my veins were being quilted or embroidered,  I told them to stop.  They had no other treatments to offer,  so I went home.  The following Monday at the university,  (HSU), I went to see the campus nurse,  and was given both oral and topical medications to relieve my symptoms.  I got expert care at HSU, and no care (in fact,  injurious care) at Mad River ER.  The one star for Mad River Hospital is given because my visit there resulted in my receiving Medi-Cal benefits later on.  Perhaps I just went to MRER when they were having an off night,  but the experience has made me gun shy of ever going there again.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x54d1575285115d49:0x33c0b71780393b45<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>I have visited here 3 times since living in arcata for 2 months on vacation. My primary care doctors are in los angelus and Medford Oregon I have 2 severe illnesses that cause massive amounts of pain and neurological issues along with kidney problems. So the first time I thought they were nice enough the doctor was short and had a accent I couldn't understand well. They said I was pregnant I insisted on an ultrasound to check the placement of the pregnancy since I was bleeding and in so much pain. He said they couldn't see it on the ultrasound I left unable to walk or drive well. The very next day I called a obgyn and got seen immediately only to find out the pregnancy was placed wrong and had to be terminated. The second visit I was treated by a different doctor for kidney infection he was much better than the first doctor. On my last visit yesterday at 10:15 am o saw the same do tor as the first time for severe vomiting and diarrhea along with heat flashes and body shaking  during the episode I was laying on the floor puckering and pooping all over unable to do anything but scream. As soon as I could drive myself to hospital I did. They moved me to a room fast then the doctor came in and said " I saw you in January and the other doctor just saw you nothing can be wrong if you say this has been happening 6 months and you didn't mention it then". BEFORE I EVEN GOT A CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM. He told me they couldn't do anything for me unless I wanted blood tests. I was very upset due to the experience I had causeing me to seek medical treatment. I ask for another person to speak with and he sent in the nurse and the head nurse both who said that nothing was wrong with me. I asked the nurse " WHAT does he think I am?! A crackhead?!" She just looked at me funny. I have been discriminated against severely by this hospital due to the clothing I wear ( very expensive undyed hemp and bamboo clothing) and the purse I carry. I even told the nurse " I don't know what's wrong or what helps I'm not on any drugs and I don't want and god dam pain medication I just want help". to make it worse for them I called my specialist who works at UCLA he called the another hospital and I had my husband drive me there they did abdominal tests and found severe swelling and lumps in my bowels and intenstine. The doctor obviously knew what he was doing because "absolutely nothing is wrong" I only have to spend a few days i the hospital to recover. I will be complaining to the hospital along with many other people when someone comes in and gets refused treatment due to "I think she's a druggie" is not right.</text>< UserId.>

Ive had non stop problems w upper management and drs. Maybe there's so few still around they can act like arrogant jerks and get away w it. They all come to humboldt..sweet chill. Then the dr change. Idk what happens..but its sad. Three calls in the management and nothing. Every provider in the county become like this. Sad. Nurses and paperwork peeps are great. U can see they get it all the time and they don't know what to do either. Perhaps obe of these places needs to hi an occupational psychologist. Theyve got to barely be keeping it afloat w pr like this<//text>

<text>Worst hospital I have ever been to. Waited 2 hours for the er and they never even saw me in the er. I saw a doctor for about 3 minutes before he shoo'd me out without running any tests. If you have anything seriously wrong with you, make the drive to Eureka or fortuna. Mad River won't do anything for you.< /text><time>1460656438709< /time>< Response>

<text>None of the workers under the building seem to be in sync. The place is ran individually by everyworker.  I you ask two diffrent nurses or representates the same question and recieved two completely different answers. The environment is completely unstable, every visit to the hopstial is a completely different experience and procedure. Some fixing definitely needs to be done internally my management or something.<//text>< pics>

The YouTube videos don’t even depict Dave but a completely different guy who is not even associated with this business.

Unlike a lot of these other comments I’ve actually been to David’s auto repair and am not leaving a review based on a YouTube video ( which is not even the right shop) . I’ve been coming to David for 5 years and he has always done great work at a reasonable price ( everything from rebuilding my engine to simple oil changes ) . I recommend David’s auto shop .<//text>

That guy shown on the video is actually the owner of the shop next door, to the right of Davids Auto. His building has no sign on the building only on his front door. Maybe before you guys start accusing random shops and trying to ruin their credibility and reputation, you guys should dig deeper as to who the person actually is and what they actually own. Did you guys even get the sellers name?</Review>< Gmap_id>

This guy is a cheat a hack a ripoff master. Guy doesn't know what he's doing. I took my truck in to get the check engine light fixed and he says OK ill have it done today, he calls me 2 days later to come pick up my truck and to find a 450 dollar invoice, my dash board broken and not put back together correctly and he says it was already like that and it was a lot of work and parts that's why i have 450 dollar bill. I get home and try to fix it only to find out that he has removed my check engine light bulb without making any repairs.  I replaced the light bulb and it turned on right away. He could not figure out how to fix it so he just took out the light bulb and said he fixed it. I take the truck back to him and the shock on his face when i showed him the check engine light on was priceless. He argued that he did not remove the light bulb and that this was a different code my truck was giving so he would have to charge me again to fix it again and he would not honor the warranty. He is a crook and a cheat. Stay as far away as you can from this place!. I'm in the process of taking him to court now.< /text>

Saw a video of him trying to sell a rough condition car to someone. Car had so many problems. Listening to how he tried to inform them of problems was painful. "The car will learn how to drive again and it won't grind in 3rd" Are you kidding me? I hope this shop gets shut down.< /text>

< Review>
Most amazing food ever! I wish more people would visit so the business could grow larger. They serve both vegan and animal eaters food so everybody has options.
Pizza, burgers, curry, salads. And all the food is enough for 2 meals.< /Review>

I won't lie, I was pleasantly surprised at my visit here! I've been to this place when it was under it's previous name; this week was my first visit to ICONIC Eats. Tuesday night after the dinner rush was pretty dead - my friend and I were the only ones here - this meant short wait for food ;) I got the beer battered portabella sandwich and my friend got the double craft burger. We were both very satisfied with our meals! Also split french fries, worth it. I got the double peanut butter shake - delish, didn't regret that. Service was awesome and attentive. This is a great spot for groups of varying diets - vegan, omnivore, keto, gluten free - all will be happy. The decor and atmosphere is pretty good. I'll be back and update as I try more dishes!< /text>

Iconic eats as a great place to get vegan food. They have a large variety of non vegan food so everyone can enjoy what they want. I like the vegan burgers, curry and appetizers. Every time I go I enjoyed what I had. My kids enjoy it because it they can get regular pizza so I don't have to try to convince them to get something they don't want so that I can eat healthy.< /review>

Pretty pricey for what you get. Food is decent but nothing special. Fries do not come with burgers. Service was good.< /text>

<date>1517114826412</date><rate>5<//rate><Text>Best food in town and especially so if you're vegan or vegetarian as they have so many options. My personal favorite is Revenant Burger but I've yet to try anything that isn't worthy of the five star rating. The place has a similar feel and style to Blaq Square, but with improved service and food quality-- something I didn't think was possible. Definitely check this place out!< /Text>< pics>

This restaurant has good food but it is never open consistently. I ordered from Grubhub, and 45 min later I got a call from the driver that Iconic Eats was closed, with a sign on the door dated yesterday. How this place is still open, I have no clue. I have gone there on other occasions and it’s had a sign on the door saying the same thing. Now, to me, it’s a restaurant I liked the food from, but it’s gone out of business. It’s disappointed me too many times. I don’t recommend even trying it<//Text>

<text>Meat, Vegan, Vegetarian... All of the above. This place Rocks! Went there for the first time a week or so ago with the wife unit. I am a plant based eater and she is not, we BOTH FOUND something good to eat. The meals were generously sized and extremely tasty . My wife even tasted my meal and said that it was SOMETHING THAT SHE WOULD EAT!!!! That really says a lot. I highly recommend giving this place a try.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c28712bff798d5:0x608243f7ac29ac7c<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is AMAZING to say the least. Anytime we come here we have not been disappointed! The food is always on point and never ceases to amaze us. The chefs here really know what they are doing.</review>

Service is pretty bad for the upcharge on anything vegan. Should do much better. How much longer will it be around? Hard to tell but need to step it up!< /Text>

<gmapID>0x80c28712bff798d5:0x608243f7ac29ac7c<//gmapID><Review>Despite this place constantly changing either it's name or ownership, one thing they've kept constant, is the food; more specifically, their pizza. This little gem, tucked away in an already tucked away shopping center, will not disappoint someone looking to have actual quality pizza. Gone are the days in SCV where quality pizza is impossible to find and names like Tomato Joe's are tossed around as "the best". Write down the address of this place before it's name changes again, but trust in it's pizza because it will certainly not disappoint. As a little side note, the brussel sprouts appetizer is delicious. Vegetable lovers and haters alike, do yourself a favor and try them.< /Review></record>

We went their last Thursday for the first and last time. Despite the restaurant being nearly empty ( I counted 4 other tables) the service was beyond slow. Even getting a glass of water was a 10-15 min process. Ordering dinner was another 5 min after that. We we're casually informed an hour into our seating that the pizza chef had to leave (emergencies happen I know) and now anything involving bread, pizza, paninis, etc....we're off the menu. So we had to change our order...again.
Between the  4 of us we had 3 burgers and 1 sandwich (Bang Mi) in addition to a beer/glass of house wine, only one each. We waited so long(2 other tables waiting for food left) that our table was about to leave (purse in hand) when she brought our food. The burgers were dry and we asked for ketchup and mayo BOTH of which they were out of. Huh? The sandwich was beyond bland (tofu, cilantro mush) and our experience was just awful.
Then the bill came. We were shocked at how pricey it was ($125) and how (out of good faith) nothing was comped. My husband and I even spoke up about it to our waitress and she was no help and not willing to see the customer side of it. We paid cash, left a $10 tip and told her we would never be back. I am currently trying to contact the owner.
Honestly, I would of had more respect if they just shut the restaurant down for the night after the cook/chef left.</Review>

The place wasn’t busy when we got there but the young staff was too busy socializing instead of taking care of the customers. We waited almost 10 minutes before anyone took our order. The server didn’t make any recommendations or even tell us what they had to drink. She just set the menus on the table and walked away. Not sure how long they will be in business.<//review>

This is my go-to for any hankering I have, the plates are well portioned and the service is always excellent, and I love the atmosphere. Dining in from what I remember was extremely pleasant too, with a lot of seating options and a great location, it's easily a 5 star from me.< /text>

This is the first time I've ordered online and my food wasn't waiting for me when i arrived. In fact, i waited 10 minutes for them to get me my single gyro wrap. Not a huge deal but if it's going to be delayed the website ordering system and or email confirmation should reflect.<//Text>

Falafel gyro is reliably good. Although onions  once we're obviously precut and stored too long.</review>

<Text>I like the food, what I don't like is the service.  Twice I've ordered online and chosen a pickup time (20-25 minutes).  Each time the food was not ready when I arrived.  The last time (Saturday night), they didn't even have my order.   Why choose a pickup time if they can't have the food ready?  There were only 3 staff on a very busy Saturday night, so where is the owner or his family to pitch in and help out?   Right now it's mostly takeout, so Nick, get your act together.</Text>< Name>

<time>1604201990932<//time><review>Very disappointed at the quality of the food. We got 3 gyro and 1 burger. Only one of the gyros had a decent amount of feta cheese and thequality of lamb/beef tasted cheap. The baklava was sugary sweet when it is usually syrup sweet. I have also never had to use a knife to cut baklava. Spent almost $100 definitely not worth it.</review>< rate>

< Review>
Nick the Greek has great and quick Greek food that combines traditional dishes like Gyros with American ones like fries (Greek fries). I had the beef/lamb gyro, and although simple, it was delicious. For only $9.95, the meal was a very filling lunch that was fast. My order came out within 10 minutes and it was gone in five. This is a must have for people who stop by in Santa Cruz or just the bay area in general as I have seen other cities with them. Additionally, Nick the Greek was very spacious providing ample room for six feet. Along with this, staff wore masks and there were hand washing and sanitizing stations.< /Review>

<name>jasmine Montgomery</name><Date>1609697479921</Date><review>If I could possibly give a half star  I would, good food, bad service. I ordered a combo special through grub hub app for my son who loves thier gyros... when my husband went in to pick up order( they seemed busy, was quite a few people in lobby waiting for orders), he was told quickly by cashier that there was no order under our name, I know I ordered because my card was charged, my husband asked for the manager,  he then says he doesn't have the order either...after my husband running back and forth, he says he found the order. And that they don't use that  company anymore..?! I know I'm not the only one who uses Grubhub to order stuff ..and he wanted his money...
At that point we just wanted our food so we can go..finally he said he would give us our order and try to collect money from company. My card is still pending and hoping that the store gets thier money and a new cashier to be more nice and accommodating to customers who are just trying to get their food..<//review><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

Tasty! Delicious! Eating here for the first time. Thanks to Covid, they got takeout and it couldn't have been smoother or quicker. I called in my order and by the time I got there, it was ready for me. Terrific set up for the times. Hand sanitizer by all entrances, telling patrons to use it and, of course, masks when entering. On to the good part now: the food. They were SOOO delicious beef/lamb gyros. I also ordered a side to go with the spicy yogurt sauce. I might add a terrific addition. We are going to be back for sure!< /Review>

Pretty damn good. Was in Greece around 2 years ago and it's spot on. Beer is pricey, but everything else reasonably priced.  We had the Lamb gyro, greek salad and Nick's Fries rounded out with 2 ciders. Get some Baklava while eating outside during this covid.</review>

<review>I was a bit put off by the numerous tables needing wiped off, but the place different seem overall dirty. We enjoyed our wraps, but the 1st round of fries were cold. I appreciated they were quick to apologize and correct it with fresh hot delicious garlic fries. The taziki sauce wasn't the best I've had, a bit thick and pasty, but not the worst. The gyro wrap was absolutely fresh and perfect. We would eat there again.</review>< Pictures>

Their beef/lamb gyro has some good flavor and their creamy sauce is excellent. Service was quick too, even on opening day midway through the lunch rush. Surprisingly busy too given the place didn’t even advertise their existence much.

The portion-size of their Gyro-Fries Combo is equitable with that of Five Guys’ Cheeseburger and (smallest) Fries Combo.<//text>< Pictures>

I like the Greek salad, I wish there was more feta and olives in it so maybe ask for extra if you like those. Otherwise it's very good. I've tried all the meats and don't really like them but the falafel is always good. Maybe I've just gotten unlucky with the meats but they've always been dry or unpleasant. The baklava is sooo good def recommend. Idk if this is authentic, it's more of a chain style fast food style Mediterranean but it's still super good. The fries are usually good too. I like the spicy yogurt sauce and usually get an extra one on the side.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808e41ecab204c9b:0x3369cf2a5c1e9110<//GmapID></record>

That has not been the case on two occasions at the Santa Cruz location.  Just check your order to make sure it is correct don’t trust the packaging.</review>< Pictures>

I’m so happy to have a new Greek restaurant in town. A no frills approach to Greek food. Keeping it simple and tasty. These guys know what they are doing. Their food is delicious!

Service is friendly and quick. Make your order and choose a table to eat in or get your food to go and head to Abbot square or any other spot you like.

So far I’ve tried the chicken gyro, falafel bowl and Greek fries. Everything was really tasteful, but my favorite was the falafel bowl. Amazing!!<//Review>

Never was a customer never will be. My 7 year old son went in there on his own to use the restroom. And they told him no, if he wasn't a customer. This never happened  before nowhere, who says this to a child that needs to use the restroom?< /text>

Dirty tables and floors. Paid for food for my family only to watch order after order come out that belonged to people who came AFTER we ordered. Finally got our food and the gyro salad tasted like nothing but oil and salt. My sons French fries were the best tasting thing out of all we ordered, FRENCH FRIES! I regret coming here.< /Review>

<Review>I just had a chance to try the beef and lamb gyro wrap, it was filled with so much flavor. I love how the restaurant looks nice and modern. I was able to order my food in 2 minutes and have it served to me within about less than 7 minutes. I will definitely try exploring the menu next time and recommending it to my friends<//Review>< Pictures>

I actually really liked the Sunnyvale location of Nick's.  The food was fresh, servings large and the prices seemed reasonable.

This location our food was cold and the fries were overcooked and cold. An early problem we had hoped they had worked out.

I kept looking at their food prep video repeating over and over in front of me and thinking "I want THAT!"...not what I was served.  Those fries looked like what I got in Sunnyvale.

Music in the restaurant was really loud and pretty much precluded conversation.

Disappointed.</text>

As someone who loves Greek and Armenian Nick does very well for flavor and portion. What's is lacking are good tahini and garlic sauces for their chicken.  Ask for the chicken with the mustard sauce on the side, Nick's mustard is an unfortunate sugary mustard which tastes like ketchup without the tomato.< /Text>

<resp>None</resp><text>My son's Gyro and fries looked ok. I wanted a Gyro sandwich on the "plate" with fries and a salad. Guess I didn't make that clear. Did not get a sandwich, just cut up meat and little triangles of pita bread. Salad was the worst Greek salad I have ever gotten, no Greek Olive, two little pieces of tomato, two little slivers of onion, and a whole lot of lettuce, and i have no idea what the dressing was but was not a Greek dressing I am aware of. Will not be back.</text>< user_name>

For my first time, Nick the Greek was fairly disappointing. We were here for the beginning of lunchtime and I expected everything to be cooked to order. Instead the fries were stale and dry. The feta cheese was not enough to make the Greek Fries worth the money.

For those of us that ordered meat, it was not the most pleasant experience, in that it lacked flavor, and it tasted a day old. When it came to the rice, it was crunchy, thus underdone.

We had researched the restaurant online. Watched some amazing videos of how the food is prepared and ultimately, we found ourselves disappointed in the quality of the food.</Text>

I loved the food, the falafel bowl was delicious.
I went for my first time on a day they had a test kitchen going, before the grand opening. I never felt like it was a practice run, they we're really quick, had friendly service, nice/clean space and great food! If the quality stays the same then I'll be back!<//Review>

Friendly service, nice clean open floor plan and a wonderful addition to the downtown community. I hat the Chicken Souvlaki plate with pita bread and I thought it was very refreshing and tasty. The mustard sauce complimented the chicken and the rest of the ingredients. Falafel of Santa Cruz is going to be put out of business!!<//review>

The gyros are great. Tzatziki had good flavor. Pricing was average. They have a spicy tzatziki also, its good. The fries are limp and flavorless. Service was quick and just okay.< /text>

Hands down the best Greek food in Santa Cruz. My wife and I ordered a couple of times through DoorDash and it always seems to arrive lukewarm. We remarked both times that we should try to go to the restaurant one time. I'm glad we did. It is so much better fresh out of the kitchen. I had the Chicken Souvlaki salad and my wife had the Falafel Bowl. Both were delicious. They need to work on delivery times, but the food in house is great.</Text>

< Review>
Went there twice,  ordering chicken slouvaki one time and just chicken skewers the other.  Both times I found the chicken pieces to be full of fat and gristle, and not made from just chicken breast as I requested.  Will never go back there!!< /Review>

Placed an order on an exhaust after confirming with a rep that it was still available. Literally at that time. Yep! Was the response. Order showed pending for 2 days so I emailed and asked why. They said it was sold before I placed my order. I asked what do you have in stock for the Civic Type-R exhaust. Response was to look at the website and give them part numbers and they would check. (Website doesn’t list availability). I get it, steel is in short supply. Don’t tell people it’s there unless you confirm it. I asked for a refund as I don’t want to hunt around randomly to find out what may or may not be in stock via email.<//Review>

Great customer service. Josh was able to help me find the wheels I wanted from WORK, even though they weren’t in stock. He found them for me and got them shipped in a matter of days. They came in perfect shape and they got here in less than a week, including the time it took to get the wheels from WORK. Making such a big purchase is always scary, but I would definitely order from them again in the future.< /text>

<time>1613151052419<//time><review>So so so happy with the work that they did on my Honda. I wanted new exhaust installed and they did amazing work, the team here are all pretty seasoned gearheads and they gave me great advice. I was a little daunted at first because I know this is the place serious car guys go and I didn’t want to get intimidated but these guys made me feel at home. Good price + great service and it was worth the long drive for me to make to get my car done up right.< /review>< user_id>

I ordered my husband Rays 17 Hex Lug Nut and Lock Set from Evasive Motorsports. I was worried since we’ve never ordered from here before but I decided to go through with it because they were decently priced compared to other places that I found online. The next business day, I received a text notification from Evasive mentioning the item was back ordered. They asked me if I wanted to wait for the order or cancel. I initially paid more for expedited shipping but because it was back ordered they refunded me the difference of their regular ground shipping. I really liked how they notified me right away. Customer service was friendly, fast and efficient. It was expected to be more than 2 weeks but we actually received the item in about a week or so after placing the order. I would definitely order from them again!<//Review>

Asked for a shipping quote, was told, add item to cart for shipping cost. No Hi, thanks for inquiring, this is the easier way, etc. You have to set up an account to do so. So it's not.
Great sales support.</Text>

Bad customer service, they couldn’t even help me out with a part I knew they had in stock because I had just checked online. I drove far to pick it up in person just so that they could tell me I had to order it online. Thanks for nothing Evasive Motorsports.</Review>

Co-sponsored a give away on Instagram for a Nissan GTR and 15k cash, and their  business and name was all over the merchandise for the giveaway. I bought 5 entry’s only to find out the give away was a SCAM!!!! They stole money from me and everyone who entered. Even if it wasn’t Evasive motor sports themselves why would they SPONSOR the giveaway and be ON THE MERCH !?! They should be sued</review>

I gave them the info they needed and that's when it went silent. I didnt get a reply for almost 25 days from Tony at customer service. After double emailing him I received an email back almost immediately saying my part would be a special order and it would take time. Of course I knew this and that's why I got into contact with them in the first place. Would've been just fine if you they emailed back immediately to get things going with Japan but no.

The wheels that I want need a special order from Japan. Evasive Motorsports gives me the best experience to get what I really need. They answered all my questions and gave me reasonable quote. Really recommend this place.</Text>

<text>Real honest shop with knowledgeable people.  If you feel like you are not getting the service you think you deserve, that means they are busy helping other customers.  I've been a customer for over 10 years and brought many of my vehicles for F&F treatment and basic maintenance. Shop with confident or stop by to say hi.<//text>< Pics>

This is a long overdue review.  Had been purchased bunch of parts from them for my Honda Civic Type R since 2018 and couldn’t be happier with the level of services they provide. I would give them 6 out of 5 star if I could.<//Text>

Great place to actually order Japanese aftermarket parts. I ordered an HKS 200 mm dry 3 layer filter element and it was delivered in about 2 weeks.  Not bad considering Covid 19. They reached out to me by text and email asked if I was ok with the delay. Other aftermarket shops rarely return my calls. I will probably go down to their location to see if they work on Mitsubishi models!<//Review>

Every purchase I have made through Evasive has been flawless. Even during instances where an item I ordered may have been wrong (whether it is from my mistake or theirs), they have always acted very quickly and accordingly to make sure that I am happy and that I get the right part. I have ordered Recaros through them, a varis kit, and a handful of other things. I couldn't be anymore happier with the customer service that I receive from these guys. Shout out to Josh especially for always hooking me up and working with me.</review>

They honor their quoted prices and don’t try to cheat or short change you on services. A+ group of guys and I will continue to be a loyal customer.</review>< date>

I will no longer spend anymore of my hard earned money on this company that does not value its customers. I will make sure to let all my car group people be aware of this company’s actions in hopes they don’t get ripped off too.< /Review>< UserId.>

I brought in my car to get lowered and Hugh sold me a set of KW Clubsport for my FR-S at an amazing price.  One of the most professional company that actually understands the products they sell and how to use them. Id recommend Evasive to my friends and family.</Review>

Honest: I might be the most versed in the tuner world, but these guys will share their opinion on what is good and what is recommended.

Knowledgeable: if I am debating on a part, upgrade, service, ... anything... Evasive is where I go to get real time facts. I watch what impact they have done in the industry: set the top time at Willow Springs, race Pikes Peak, return a JDM car back to Japan for circuit! Experience is the best knowledge you can ask for!

Most of all - I’m thankful for Evasive! Why? Because with the trust I have in them every day, with the honestly that they provide, and the knowledge they gain in advancing the industry - I was able to achieve the biggest goal any car enthusiast could of ever asked for - build a car for SEMA! That’s not pure luck that I made it there. I could not be more honored to have such great partners in that project!

<Review>So I went on this company website to purchase 15mm and 20mm H&R spacers. After I made the purchase, a few hours later I received a text message from the company stating they did not currently have the 15mm spacers in stock and would I be okay with them being shipped later? I texted back and said sure! I called a day later to see if they could give me an approximate date for the 15mm spacers to be shipped and they told me by the end of the following week.

Well I couldn't wait that long so I asked them to cancel the order for the 15mm spacers and just charge me for the 20mm and shipping. They told me "All Sales are Final" which is stated on the website. My response was if you don't have a product in stock then you haven't sold it to me. What you have actually done is charge me for a product you don't have so that doesn't constitutes a sell. Their response was, "well we texted you to ask if you would be okay with the product being shipped later!"

It should not matter if they texted me or not. If you don't have the product in hand and you're not sure when you will have it then it should not have been listed on their website and I should refunded my money. To say well the request has already been sent to the manufacturer so we can't give you a refund is ludicrous!

This is a very shady business tactic from Evasive Motorsports. Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything else from them!<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1599763534101, 'text': 'Hi Roderick, we cancelled the second pair as requested. The issue was we had already submitted the order to H&R after confirming with you that you were okay for the spacers to ship out a few days later after the order. We were not sure if we could get H&R to cancel the order before the shipment was made and had to get confirmation from them first. Fortunately, they were able to do so. We were not trying to make it complicated, but the order was submitted for shipping already and out of our hands by the time you changed your mind about the order.'}< /resp>< gmap_id>

<text>One of the best in the business. Knowledgeable sales people, great technical support and some of the only people I trust to service my cars. I’ve purchased parts from them for over 15yrs. Never once had a bad experience. Purchased parts and service for my Evo, Hondas, S14, and even my Tundra. Had my engine dyno tuned here, track alignments done here and will continue to come back. It is rare to find a staff filled with enthusiasts who know what they are selling, have experience with a variety of parts and brands, and a willingness to help old and new customers alike.< /text>< pics>

Randy was extremely helpful and reached out to me to notify me that my order was a pre-order and that my item would not be in stock till August. He then helped me find some wheels that were in stock and even found me some lug nuts that would fit the pocket size. I Will use Evasive Motorsports for all my performance purchases from now on.

<Review>I purchased an intake from them then installed it. Within 10 minutes of having it installed I knew there was a problem with the intake. I contacted them looking to either return or exchange the intake. They stated due to the box being open, and the fact it was installed the was nothing they could do and that i had to take it up with the manufacturer. I would steer people away from purchasing with them. Had to open a case with the Better Business Bureau.< /Review>< pics>

I have been going to evasive exclusively for the past 11 years. I absolutely refuse to do business or trust my cars in anyone elses hands. They have the best inventory and parts available as well the best techs in the business. From street/track cars to offroad vehicles, evasive does it all. Dont waste your time with any other place.</text>

CY is a great guy and always has answers to my questions.  He helped me find the burned out fuse when that wasn't what I came for and didn't charge me for that even though I insisted. Went above and beyond.  This was about 2 months ago but I wanted to post because mostly people complain but never post something positive. So I'm here  to leave a positive review. Thank you CY and Evasive. Keep up the good work!< /Text>< Pictures>

The guys been helpful every time I’ve had questions on orders, product placement, and other random small questions regarding car parts. He even actually calls you back in a timing manner. Which is great. I will definitely continue business with Evasive for this reason 👍< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The best guys in the business for aftermarket tuning.  From parts, installation, tuning, body part customization, you won't be disappointed.  I typically like to work on my own car if i can but these guys are one of the few I will trust to touch my car.  Don't think twice, these guys are awesome.< /Review>< Rating>

Can always trust them to get the job done right the first time and they almost always have the parts I need in stock so it's a same day turnaround on repairs and maintenance. I remember when I needed to get my clutch replaced I called the local Honda dealership (stealership) and they wanted 4 times what Evasive quoted. Plus Evasive was the only place that was able to get the whole thing done in ONE day! As much as I hate the traffic getting there from West Hollywood, it's always worth it. If you're looking for a fair honest group of technicians and race pros to trust your baby with, this is the place.</review>< date>

These guys are amazing! I brought my Lexus ISF in to modify the stance and suspension! They hooked it up and it looks amazing! Plus, they gave me an Evasive Motorsports License Plate Frame, so now it’s official ;) Thanks Evasive!<//Review>

<Review>It's too bad you can't rate 10 stars. Evasive has been out of this world for us. Great prices, great products, and even greater people. They've even come through when we were ripped off by Modern Automotive Performance. Shame a company has to drop to the level of selling parts they don't have.  The guys at Evasive  are pros, they were able to come up with what we were missing. This is the company you want to deal with.
Thanks to them, the EVO 969 will be at Grid Life/Road Atlanta again this year!< /Review><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I went with evasive due to shady Craigslist post and other suppliers with limited inventory when it comes to buying real wheels.

Everything went smooth at evasive except the long wait time. I had an appointment for 11 am to mount and balance my tires. I didn't leave with my tires untill 12:37. I waited such a long time for my new wheels, it even killed my excitement for the day because at the very end. I was mostly mad then even overjoyed because of the long time. I understand these are hard tires to install on such an expensive wheel (te37sl)/ limited staff.

The night before I already had it in my head of leaving a 5 star review and sadly that's not the experience I had here.

Customer service was spot on and the accuracy with my order was as to be expected. If these two I previously mentioned we're poor. This would be a 1 star review.

Overall I will order from them again but not have then install anything, wait times are ridiculously long.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I've been going to Evasive since they had their first shop. The guys are always knowledgeable about race setups, most recently went to buttonwillow for trackday and had alignment done. The mechanics are reliable, but most importantly honest with me and always tell me without trying to sell me. Evasive is definitely the shop I always go to. thanks guys.< /text>

Good company, however bought an exhaust at a listed price, only to have someone call me saying that the price was wrong and needed to be higher. I already had made the transaction and should've been sent the item. However, they offered me a discount on the actual price should I want to buy the item. I complied but that was false advertising due to someones mistake. Not mine.<//review>

<text>This salon is very professional and Sue did a really great job on my hair. I came in for a cut and perm. She showed me a lot of photos and replicated the reference photo exactly She is very attentive and checks up on you often during the hair cutting process. She also taught me how to take care of my hair and gave me step by step instructions on what to do on how to style my hair. Thank you so much for the amazing haircut! I will be coming back next time.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Sue recently cut and permed my hair and it came out really nice. She puts in a lot of time and genuine care. She really tries to help find a haircut that would suit the client, but at the same time is respectful of the type of hairstyle the client would like. Would go to her again!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I got a haircut here today and I love it sooo much! People are friendly and professional. They also help styling my hair after haircut. Will definitely try color dye or curling my hair later! :)

FYI $60 for women haircut (tips not included)</text>

<Review>Sue was super friendly and professional. She had a private room to ensure customers feel safe. Plus, she addressed my ideal hair style and concerns thoughtfully. I got a hair cut, root perm, and natural perm. I would definitely come back every 3-6 months.<//Review>< Pictures>

It was a great experience at this salon. I got my hair dyed and my husband got a haircut and perm, and both of us were very satisfied with the service.  The place was clean and not crowded, which felt safe enough. I would recommend this salon!</Review>

<text>First time here. The male barber does no't understand English well. The cut is careless and low quality. When you have a request in styling they don't know how to solve it. The good reviews do not mean anything. Please be aware before coming here.<//text>< pics>

<text>My whole family have been getting haircuts from the owner, Sue for a long time and we were never disappointed. She is very professional and knows the best. I have been getting a perm for many years, and I like how my perm comes out every time. My hair doesn't get damaged as well. The price is reasonable. She is also very kind and patient with children. My three boys love going to the place to get a haircut. Especially my youngest boy with special needs doesn't get anxious or scared when he gets a haircut. She is super nice and very flexible with little children. I love to see my boys' nice haircut and that is why we come back over and over. Thank you, K-Beauty!< /text></record>

If you are looking for a place to get your hair cut, this is the place to go! Their salon and workers follow the covid guidelines that are in place, which I noticed many salons don't, and are very professional. They also listen carefully to what type of style you want and also handle your hair with care. I am super happy with my results and will definitely be coming back!< /Text>

<review>I haven't gotten a hair cut for a long time (obviously covid) and so I went thinking I would just get a cut but somehow ended up getting my very first perm. Needless to my worries, my perm came out better than I even expected lol Also, I didn't really have an example hair photo to show the person but they analyze your hair condition and style to match which hair cuts or perms will look nice on you. If you do have an example photo, they will probably cut it exactly like it too. I'm glad my hair turned out really great. If you're looking for a hair cut and live around this place, you should definitely check it out.< /review><gmapID>0x808fcbbe0bb2d295:0xe9f3736c95ea8e8a< /gmapID>< Rate>

Su is an amazing stylist! I curled my hair and it looks great. This Salon is a rare find in US! It's a modern salon. Su has a great eye of fashion trend and knows exactly what I was looking for. The 3 hour hair curling experience is fantastic! Five star recommendation.</text>

The good reviews don't mean anything.  The service of this salon is the worst.  I went to have a haircut the other day.  The whole cut process took about 5 min.  The guy who cut my hair was careless and intended to rush to get his work done, while there was no one waiting after me.  The haircut was a disaster.  What kind of good haircut can be done within 5 min?  I had to run to another salon to repair my hair.  The worst decision I've ever made.  I'll never go again.<//review>

<Name>Ann Yun<//Name><Review>I was a bit worried because, ya know, Covid-19. But Repit was super clean, had good air circulation, and they're limiting the number of appointments to allow for social distancing.
Sujin gave me a haircut, magic straight, and fixed the color of my hair - I can't stop running my hands through my hair! It's so smooth.
I'd recommend coming here to fix your stay-at-home haircuts; you won't regret it.
Also, Sujin was super flexible with timing and was meticulous with the cut/coloring.<//Review><date>1599888602728<//date><response>None<//response><Rating>5< /Rating><gmap_id>0x808fcbbe0bb2d295:0xe9f3736c95ea8e8a< /gmap_id>< Pics>

I needed a hair cut as I haven't had one throughout quarantine. I called and Su answered the phone and reassured me she will be able to help me out. I came in and she was very professional, Covid-19 safety procedures were in place. All employees had masks and a face shield was given to me during the haircut. She listened to how I wanted my hair to be styled and promptly provided! I am ecstatic about the service I received and will return in the future.</Review>

<Review>This place is amazing! I have straightened my hair only at the top salons in Seoul before and was skeptical about getting my hair done in the US; however, the hair stylist knew exactly what she was doing and she straightened my hair without burning it or damaging it and the effect lasted for more than 6 months. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone looking to straighten their hair !< /Review><GmapID>0x808fcbbe0bb2d295:0xe9f3736c95ea8e8a<//GmapID><pictures>None<//pictures>< rate>

Finally, it's opened! I strongly recommend the people who have trouble with styling or caring about details of your hair. You won't be regret. I've been got service from one designer for few years, and every time I'm so happy because no more need to be stressed about my hair.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) My hair is thin, so it's always difficult to organize my hair, but thank you for taking care of it~ As you recommended, I color it in a dark color and it feels much cleaner. 🥰

(Original)
머리카락이 얇아서 머리정리가 항상 힘든데, 잘 케어해주셔서 감사해요~ 추천해주신데로 어두운색으로 컬러입혔더니 훨씬 깔끔해진 느낌입니다.🥰<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<review>(Translated by Google) I will write a Korean review as well as an American review:

First of all, you should have recognized the neon signs that you see as you enter. Does that break a lot of money from Korea? Hmm... I took pictures before entering the shop. The boss's force that you see as you enter is enormous. You dyed your hair with ash, but a person who looks really good with short hair was touching your hair. Another surprise was that there was a locker in front of the bathroom. It's common in Korea, but it's hard to find in the United States. Obviously, the boss really cares about it. And when you look at the boss's equipment, your mouth opens. Do you have love and passion for work everywhere in the shop? Five-star value with these three items ㅇㅈ?

Then let's talk about the boss's skills. First of all, the boss knew all of my heads. My face is a little flatter. The heads on both sides should not have volume, and the head should be raised a little to create an optical illusion that looks slim. It would be nice to hear the boss’s expert opinion. I really liked my hair. I don't need to say any more. Experience it yourself.

American review:
Neon sign = good.
sajagnim (boss of the hair salon) hair style = dope.
locker room = unseen before. crazy cool.
sajangnim tools = awesome collection.
sajangnim skills = very professsional.

Sorry I was too lazy writing the American review. But, listen to your sajangnim. She's dealt with a lot more hair styles, both men's and women's before. Be humble and let her do her thang.

Love,
Justin

I will write a Korean review as well as an American review:

일단 들어가면서 보이는 네온사인부터 알아 봤어야해. 저런거 한국에서 공수해올라믄 돈 엄청 깨지거등? 크... 난 샵 들어가기 전부터 사진찍었다. 들어가면서 보이는 사장님 포스도 엄청나. 애쉬로 머리 염색하셨는데 단발이 엄청 잘 어울리시는 분이 손님 머리를 만지고 계셨지. 또 놀랐던건 화장실 앞 락커가 있다는거였어. 한국에서는 흔히 보이지만 미국에선 찾기 힘들거든. 분명 사장님 엄청 신경썼다는거지. 그리고 사장님 장비들보면 입이 벌어진다. 일에대한 사랑이랑 열정이 샵 여기저기 묻어나. 이렇게 세가지 아이템들로 별 5개 값어치 ㅇㅈ?

그러면 사장님 스킬에 대해서 얘기해보자. 일단 사장님은 내 두상을 다 알고있었어. 내 얼굴이 좀 넙대대 하거든. 양옆 머리가 볼륨이 없어야되고 위로 머리가 좀 떠야 갸름해보이는 착시 효과를 만들 수 있다네. 사장님 전문가 소견은 왠만하면 듣는게 좋을거야. 머리가 엄청 마음에 들게 됐거든. 더 말은 필요없어. 직접 경험해보쇼.

<text>(Translated by Google) I heard that it's new and the price and service are the best. I'm very satisfied with my hair. It's hard to find a hair salon that I like in Mobile.

새로생겨서 들려봤는데 가격이나 서비스도 최고네요. 머리도 아주 만족스러워요 이동네에서 마음에 드는 미용실 찾기가 어려운데 한국처럼 잘 하는것 같아서 강추입니다~~<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) It's just a newly opened beauty salon, so the facilities are clean and above all the beauty skills are excellent, the price is nice and friendly and comfortable.

새로 오픈한지 얼마 안된 미용실이라 시설도 깔끔하고, 무엇보다 미용실력이 출중하네요, 가격 착하고 친절하고 편안 합니다, 부근 미용실에 단골집이 없었는데 단골로 등록 했습니다, 강추 합니다 ^^</review>

Bomb Mexican food restaurant. By far I have tried all of their dishes  and they are good. They are known for their mole plates.  They make their own mole which is a tradition for their home state Puebla, Mexico.  I highly  recommend this restaurant.

Molly Maid was a fantastic service; the ladies were on time and more importantly, they took the time & care I remember my mother using when she too had a small business called Daisy Fresh and I know she provided impeccable care to other people's homes and cherished items of memories on walls similarly to what I experienced last week in 2021. My grandmother utilized a an individual's expertise "in the day" but that was my only knowledge. So, during CoronaV, I needed a company on top of the current daly changes needed to keep up with the reality of this virus.
My two gals were very kind & during CoronaV, they really did that same impeccable job I knew of my mom's company and went above and beyond job here with their time. I made the first choice and stuck with Molly Maid; I didn't second guess my choice at all on any level.

Thank you ladies!

Melody (No pics to reflect a before and after). Trust me, they did a fantastic work of art in care & CoronaV awareness for all.. Melody< /review>

<text>If you haven't considered Molly Maid of East CC and Solano County for your business think again.  I have used franchise cleaning services before but usually for my home and was left underwhelmed.  I decided to try Molly Maid for my office and am very impressed.  I've had the same ladies come both times and they do a great job.  I have a medical skincare office and we are very particular especially now with the sanitizing and cleaning of our space.  From the treatment rooms to the break room and reception area the ladies attention to detail is so apparent and that's saying something because we wipe down every surface multiple times a day. I now know it makes a difference who owns the franchise and how they treat and train their employees.  It's obvious this is a well run business!  From one business owner to another Great Job!< /text>< Rate>

This is the second (and last) cleaning company that I've used and I recommend them to everyone. My team is so sweet, careful, meticulous, and consistent. I 100% trust them in my home and around my delicate things. They always do a wonderful job and the only time I contact the company is to provide praise. Absolutely worth it.

We have two large dogs that shed like CRAZY and my husband and I both work so its difficult to keep a tidy house and they have given me so much of my time back.

There a two small things that you should consider: 1.) they don't do electronic billing (like you can't set up recurring payments from your credit card) BUT you can use bill pay through your bank. It just gets a little tricky with timing. 2.) there's no set time that they come. But this is because there's no time limit - they clean til the house is clean, not til a timer is up...so while it can be a little tricky with planning, you know they'll take as long as necessary to do everything right.

I wanted to add that my team, Team #1 (Marta and Nena) are the absolute best. I cannot recommend them enough!!</review>

<Review>I appreciate that they have been able to schedule me every other week on the same day within a 2 hour arrival window. Past services I have used have not been on time, or cancelled at the last minute.  Not so with Molly Maids. They are very fast, but efficient, drive a marked car, and bring their own supplies that seem to be less smelly and toxic than past cleaners have used (I hope they're environmentally friendly, but I should ask).< /Review>< Pics>

Since January 2017 Molly Maids has cleaned our house every two weeks. The ladies (team) are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. It takes a big burden off of me since I work everyday. Before I had started with Molly Maids, much of my weekends were spent cleaning house. So they have helped me to improve quality of life. A few weeks back we had a mis-hap and an heirloom wall clock was disturbed during the cleaning process. It fell, incurred some damage along with knocking out a light switch. Steve (Owner/Manager) came out the next day to survey the damage. He quickly arranged for a repairman to come out, pick up the clock and had it repaired. The man he hired brought the clock back and he did a fine job and you would never know that anything had happen to it. Steve fixed the light switch himself. All is well! Excellent Customer Service!!

Another point I would like to make is most recently we had an extended vacation. I was struggling with whom could take care of our cat while we were away. It was too long a time period to ask a neighbor to do it. I was looking at pet sitters, but I thought someone else (new) having to come into the house. Then it came to me, could Molly Maids come by an extra day or two to just give the cat water and make sure he had food?  I called the office, spoke with Kathy Gallegos. She  documented all of the details and asked her manager. We got the green light. But here's the good part! Kathy took it upon herself to come over after her shift, on her own time, to check on our cat and make sure he was OK. She even picked up our mail for us! I just can't say enough how pleased and grateful I am to Kathy and Molly Maids for this. They truly step up to please the customer in any way they can! Reliable, Friendly, Dependable, Trustworthy and Customer Focused! Thanks Kathy, Thanks Steve, Thanks to our team of ladies that cleans our house! You are all the best!</review>

{'time': 1591642666092, 'text': 'Hello Candace. We understand your frustration and your feedback is valuable to us.  We totally agree that we are not the cheapest provider out there but our prices are certainly in line with other legitimate cleaning companies. What is meant by “legitimate” companies? Ones that have workers compensation insurance, liability insurance, are bonded, hold a business license, classify their workers as employees rather than contractors, pay employees “above the table” and pay their fair share of payroll and income taxes. We are certainly not for everyone but find that our customers value and appreciate the quality of our services and peace of mind when they use us\nIn regards to responding to your emails the following is provided. We received your request for a cleaning last Thursday evening around 9pm. We of course were closed at that time so contacted you the following day and booked your cleaning for Monday. You then tried to reach us via email and by phone on Saturday advising that you wanted to cancel the cleaning. As you noted, we are closed on the weekend as posted on various sites such as Google, our website, etc.\nIt’s too bad you didn’t give us a chance to return to the office this morning (Monday) to call or email you and let you know there is no problem with cancelling your appointment. There would not have been an issue since you gave us advance notice and because of this advance notice you were not charged anything. Fair is fair.'}<//response>
<Text>Overpriced, and there cancellation policy is too strict when they are closed on the weekend. They don’t keep up with there emails.<//Text>< Pics>

We love Polly and Elva from team #5.  They are very professional. Today is the 5th time they've been here. We switched to Molly Maid because the previous cleaners took 4 hours. We work from home and appreciate how quick they are. These ladies work hard and get the same job done in 2 1/4 hours. Thank you Polly & Elva!<//review>

Two weeks ago I was out of town when it was time for maid service but needless to say my team #5 of Elva and Polly still did a wonderful job in my absents. I want to thank them for the excellent job they did then and today. It goes without saying that they are the cream of the crop.
Thanks again.< /text>

<Text>I was not very happy with my experience. I had two lady’s come and clean my  2 bed 2 bath apartment, which is not very big nor was it very dirty. One of them was very nice the other was not so friendly. I did not like that both lady’s worked together cleaning everything that they did. Instead of being more efficient by one doing one room while the other did something else. I ended up paying $200 for a full apartment cleaning and the only thing that got done was both bathrooms , one bedroom window, my sliding glass door and my kitchen cleaned. Not worth the money . There wasn’t even time to vacuum the floors, or get to the second bedroom even touched . Not only that, the lady’s left about 10 mins short of the 2 hour services that I paid for. After showing up about 30 mins late claiming that they could not find my location,. One of the ladies  had the nerve to mention to me that because they got to me late, that they had to hurry to get to their next cleaning location. The company never reached out to me to see if I was satisfied with the services I received, so instead of being difficult. My husband and I decided to just never ever use their services again. Totally not worth the money.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1596486846788, 'text': 'Hello Leeah. Thank you for your feedback. We have addressed the appropriate issues with the team - such as (1) requesting more time to complete the job if necessary (2) reinforcing their customer service skills - clearly no customer should be made to feel like their house isn\'t the highest priority. Smiling - smiling is much more welcoming than a frown. The lady you describe as "not so friendly" is not fluent in English so stayed quiet but nevertheless, a smile would go a long way towards customer service and we have reiterated that with her.  (3) it is our standard procedure to follow up with new customers to get their feedback on the cleaning. Not sure why this did not happen in your case but I must apologize that it did not. I have brought this up with our team to highlight the issue. The 10 minute variance you quoted would be attributed to the few minutes at the beginning and end of the clean for unloading and loading the equipment. As with any service company, the time starts upon arrival and stops when loaded up to leave. We are sorry you didn\'t have an excellent experience with us as most of our customers do but rest assured we take your comments to heart and always to try learn and improve.'}<//response>

Team 1 (Nena and Martha) are great! they have been coming here for years and they are great people. If there is ever an issue ( only small ever) they are always willing to listen to what I have to say and give me what I ask.
They are both super friendly and chat when ever we speak to them. We are an older couple and really feel we get what we pay for.

Nena has been with us the longest and really lets me feel like she cares and am not just a customer.

Thank you ladies</Review>

Sucked!!! Had an appointment for mani/pedi with my daughter. We felt SO rushed cuz they also kept taking walk-ins. Luckily my daughter was able to get mani/pedi. I only got pedi and was there for 2 hours.  Such a disappointment. In addition, the gel polish job isn't very good.<//Text>

Amazing!! Hidden Gem♡ Its sad that nobody put it up on Google Maps yet because I am sure they would have had much more business the past year. Mimi did an awesome, detailed, thorough, prompt gel nail fill for me as a walk in client. The entire shop is spotless and gorgeous, therapeutic almost♡ I enjoyed my experience and told her I would put them on Google as opposed to only Yelp so cheers to getting more clientele~they deserve it. I will be back for more services as well, they offer it all♡</Review>

<Review>Went to have my pedi done. Mary took care of me. All I will say is: I will def be back to see her. Place is nice and clean. My nails I have gottwn done twice, the first time nails came off within a week thought ok maybe something I did Idk. Went to a different place for my set and a week ago went here to get my fill since my old nail lady is in Livermore and was out and my fill was overdue. Well its been a week and the fill is chipping.

I decided to give this place a shot since I haven't had my nails done in years. I saw the reviews, Kelly's work online, and was impressed. I decided to walk in one day and treat myself. Kelly was nice overall and she was very attentive to my needs. I showed her what I wanted done and she hit it spot on. From now on I will be going to her to get my nails done! As for my eyebrows, I am slightly disappointed because I was in and out in a Jiff. After coming home, I realized one of my eyebrows was longer and thicker than the other! So I had to pluck my eyebrows and reshape them myself. If I ever go back there to get my eyebrows done I'm going to be much more heedful and alert. Other than that it was a good experience going there. Next time I get my eyebrows done there and it's done right I'll give them five stars! 😊<//review>

1st visit I always get a regular pedi.
Just to evaluate the cleaning.
The scuba was only on the hills and outside of the foot.
They started to put a bottom coat pollish before cleaning my toenails with the little metal  spatula.
I will stick with my Galaxy spa on Tracy.</text>

< Review>
Only one star because they use hot stones.
management needs to replace many of their nail polishes they are empty dry n crumbly. I opened at least 5 and still the one I used was poor quality. It should be shiny not matte but because they use top coat it’s shiny. I believe that’s poor quality.<//Review>

<text>New, very nice and clean! I ended up getting a full set of acrylics, pedi both with get polish and I got my eyebrows waxed. Pedi is finished with hot stone massage on your legs, feels wonderful. Not bad on price, I made an appointment for lash extensions going to try them out!< /text>< Response>

When I went back in the next time I was told they wouldn't do my nails unless I paid cash and hassled me about the $10.
Haha....too many nail salons in this town that are nicer and cleaner.</Review>< Rate>

My wife, daughter and bridal party went to get their nails done for my daughter's wedding, they made appointments and we're kept waiting, then the staff rushed their nails, sloppy acrylic coverage and insufficient polish not covering entire nails. Two of the girls requested almond shaped nails and received stillettos. Suffice it to say they will not recommend this nail salon.<//text>

<review>After 2 days my nails broke rinseing out a cup with water so after I paid 45 dollars for a fill  the nail polish that was supposed to be gel but was not  after returning for them to be fixed they attempted to charge me for the fix claiming that the nail polish has to be changed and I have to pay for that .

I don't recommend going to this mail shop it's so sad because I was happy with my nails when I left but disappointed after being overcharged for a fill.< /review>< pictures>

Food was good. Waiter was nice but forgot some things that were ordered and kept forgetting who ordered what. Menu is slightly limited from the original menu.< /Review>

I used to love this place, but they are not that restaurant anymore. Poor standards and even worse management. I was told that my bisque was supposed to have large shell pieces. My Oysters shell were partially broken, and shell was  mixed with the meat. The manager did give me that one. Terrible experience.  I wonder if I should have brought a group. I was treated much better when I brought my family.<//review>

Been coming to Scoma's for 20 plus years! Our favorite hideaway when we visit the city, so glad to see you were able to survive during this mess!! Your crab cakes set the bar for all others, and your double cheeseburger hit the spot. Thank you!< /Review>

<Review>I ordered food to-go through their website & had a fantastic experience. The order was ready early. I had the crab cakes & clam chowder. I was a little skeptical about ordering seafood to-go but both were really tasty - some of the best I've had! The staff I interacted with were very friendly. Would definitely go back. The patio looked super cute with nice views, so I'd like to eat there next time.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1621805571927, 'text': 'Happy to hear you enjoyed your Scoma\'s to-go experience!

This food was incredible! I will definitely be back. We came for a weekend trip and decided to have Sunday brunch on the warf. Best decision ever. The food presentation was artistic and Beautiful! The aroma was incredible. The smoked trout was to die for. It was smoothe and buttery in texture and the smoke on it was perfect. The crab bisque was creamy and had a smokey flavor to it which I loved.  The clams in the chowder were very tender and fresh which we enjoyed with the deliciousand fresh sourdough. My favorite dish however was the Salmon and crab cake Benedict. My eggs were cooked to perfection and the cake was the best I have ever had. There is definitely something to be said about eating fresh seafood right on the warf. The only thing that could have made my experience better would have been to watch the fishing boats unloading at the docks but it was Sunday. We did however get a lovely visit from a few Sea Lions. Couldn't have asked for a better experience on our trip.< /review>

<review>Excellent quick service, I had a reservation but was able to be seated sooner than our appointed time. The food was fresh,not surprised since we are right by the water. Fried calamari had a perfect consistency of batter, texture and flavor. I had to try the crab cake sandwich, I was not disappointed in the moist and crispy cake on a beautiful brioche bun they served me. I had a crack in my glass, I alerted the waiter to prevent any accidents/messes, he replaced the glass and beverage right away. I had to pass on the dessert, I was much too full to proceed. I recommend this place to anyone trying to have a peaceful dinner with terrific service. The price is also great for the quality of food.</review>< pics>

My friend and I sat at the bar and had a marvelous experience. The bartender Kyler couldn't be friendlier. He recommended the right tequilas and meal.

The crab cakes were perfect. The gambas al ajillo (shrimp) was divine. The hanger steak with chimichurri sauce was grilled to perfection.

I've brought many friends here over the years and look forward to next time!<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeK91DOtbHjzDdaCVG3VYLjoHpuSjjms5a74qZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2JtiOH0s0H5tmVzXcTbJBJEw7NkGvW6nn_vMq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1Iv-GHMZLdSOkEBro9hvWdpzF4PcN3AMu4qid=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

A San Francisco institution that has adapted with the times. Kudos to Scoma’s for keeping the show going with great to go food and beverage. The out door dining options are really great now, especially if the weather is nice. The hosts, bartenders, wait staff and kitchen are all very kind and smiling. The food quality is really great and the prices are reasonable. Always fresh amazing g quality fish and seafood. The chowder and crab bisque are amazing. The calamari is a favorite. The sourdough is on point. Make sure to stop by especially if the weather is nice. Make a rez if you don’t want to wait but waiting around with a drink soaking in the scene ain’t so bad. Spicy margarita is excellent. Thanks!</Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Food favorites - definitely recommend the crab cakes and clam chowder! Both were amazing.

Experience - staff was really friendly and it was so nice to sit outside and enjoy the views. The patio is dog friendly which was perfect for our pup! Service was a little slow at times but we were busy most of the time in good company.

Price - coming from Chicago I thought things were slightly overpriced here, even for seafood but maybe that’s normal to the area.

Overall would recommend!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8SHpmRsu8tUYYpmYXJanO8wH5606x91cksbGG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_EBQuNejIKYA9brJ6xytDuLM1aqymBzCCALzh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9GOnED9-H9nvv3M0n5n1y-MEOkzYLId6YX4Gn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPknBT9NXjvbbbZDtVS-37H-ybO8wb42QJ9jvnT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

Delicious food and efficient, friendly service. The hostess informed us the bayside view was a bit windy so we sat on the other side which was quiet, pleasant and felt more private. Our waiter was so friendly and checked on us often. We also ordered starters; calamari fritters and a cup of clam chowder. Couldn’t take a picture fast enough before we dug in but it was so good. We will absolutely come back to try more options.<//Text>

Excellent quick service, I had a reservation but was able to be seated sooner than our appointed time. The food was fresh,not surprised since we are right by the water. Fried calamari had a perfect consistency of batter, texture and flavor. I had to try the crab cake sandwich, I was not disappointed in the moist and crispy cake on a beautiful brioche bun they served me. I had a crack in my glass, I alerted the waiter to prevent any accidents/messes, he replaced the glass and beverage right away. I had to pass on the dessert, I was much too full to proceed. I recommend this place to anyone trying to have a peaceful dinner with terrific service. The price is also great for the quality of food.< /Text>

Made reservations online for this well-respected joint. Wanted a drink, maybe a snack.

Upon arrival, we were snottily informed that they don't do reservations for drinks. We were sat in a disused section, apparently the "seats of shame".

As we sat and sipped our drinks (15 minutes of a wait for those), we watched the main outdoor dining section. Not only was it not full, but it continued to empty as we sat.

Had the front desk jockey been kinder, we would have had more to drink and even snacks. Who knew that restaurants would be in a hurry to mistreat customers after being closed for so long?< /Text>

<Review>You won't need to be concerned about finding a parking space. They have a large parking lot where more customers can be accommodated. For me, this has been a once-in-a-lifetime chance. All will enjoy this novel. The cost of food and other items is reasonable.< /Review>< username>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>This food was incredible! I will definitely be back. We came for a weekend trip and decided to have Sunday brunch on the warf. Best decision ever. The food presentation was artistic and Beautiful! The aroma was incredible. The smoked trout was to die for. It was smoothe and buttery in texture and the smoke on it was perfect. The crab bisque was creamy and had a smokey flavor to it which I loved.  The clams in the chowder were very tender and fresh which we enjoyed with the deliciousand fresh sourdough. My favorite dish however was the Salmon and crab cake Benedict. My eggs were cooked to perfection and the cake was the best I have ever had. There is definitely something to be said about eating fresh seafood right on the warf. The only thing that could have made my experience better would have been to watch the fishing boats unloading at the docks but it was Sunday. We did however get a lovely visit from a few Sea Lions. Couldn't have asked for a better experience on our trip.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiVorGCJmQbfOBTOBiUILI5cmAwKY6pZqnizD8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn-G2RDmx0pFV790NsnemY-_Y6ymr--assxeJh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCFTN7fMGNU0eSWYSUYMXgsO3pZjGDMGLVZGjt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiZr0gc2lQjmKndtz7kWZWUVmG--JvWcPakm_y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI5NwvOVAMSDt12qJvB81qOEs0C1_DRsttJWLG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy4Sjcj3lQPjthbS-6E5G-HNaBJFmCUOqDAWn2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Amazing food. Friendly service.

My friend and I sat at the bar and had a marvelous experience. The bartender Kyler couldn't be friendlier. He recommended the right tequilas and meal.

The crab cakes were perfect. The gambas al ajillo (shrimp) was divine. The hanger steak with chimichurri sauce was grilled to perfection.

I've brought many friends here over the years and look forward to next time!<//text>

Food favorites - definitely recommend the crab cakes and clam chowder! Both were amazing.

Experience - staff was really friendly and it was so nice to sit outside and enjoy the views. The patio is dog friendly which was perfect for our pup! Service was a little slow at times but we were busy most of the time in good company.

Price - coming from Chicago I thought things were slightly overpriced here, even for seafood but maybe that’s normal to the area.

Overall would recommend!</Review>

A San Francisco institution that has adapted with the times. Kudos to Scoma’s for keeping the show going with great to go food and beverage. The out door dining options are really great now, especially if the weather is nice. The hosts, bartenders, wait staff and kitchen are all very kind and smiling. The food quality is really great and the prices are reasonable. Always fresh amazing g quality fish and seafood. The chowder and crab bisque are amazing. The calamari is a favorite. The sourdough is on point. Make sure to stop by especially if the weather is nice. Make a rez if you don’t want to wait but waiting around with a drink soaking in the scene ain’t so bad. Spicy margarita is excellent. Thanks!<//review>

If you are looking for fresh and great tasting fish and seafood, look no further. This restaurant has earned its reputation.

The service is very good and traditional. The waiting staff are very informative and explain the menu, especially making sure you are aware of what has been caught that day.

The cocktails are also amazing.< /review>

Great lunch! The food was very good. I love the grilled shrimp and catfish. We went by boat, which is a fantastic thing to do. Service was friendly and efficient.

We had a great experience at Fisherman's Wharf.< /review>

Delicious food and efficient, friendly service. The hostess informed us the bayside view was a bit windy so we sat on the other side which was quiet, pleasant and felt more private. Our waiter was so friendly and checked on us often. We also ordered starters; calamari fritters and a cup of clam chowder. Couldn’t take a picture fast enough before we dug in but it was so good. We will absolutely come back to try more options.<//Review>

Wonderful date place! Weird ally location with a gorgeous marina, overpriced weak ,measured cocktails...only the Manhattan and Martini have ,what I would call, a booze forward sotuation.The menu is ALL seafood. Except for truffle parmesan fries. Very old and famous. And, wow..what a view! If you want a 200 dinner, this is your spot! Dont ask to plug in your cell phone..there is a rule that says No! Hilarious bonus, you can usually park there.....down the Ally, pass the marina..bang a left..and BAM....you get to park. Ay su set there is a fabulous seagull show on the roof as above the trash cans.</Review>

Good choice for seafood along the wharf. The classic design and more mature staff lend an air of authenticity beyond some of the other restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the clam chowder, which was rich and full of little morsels of clam. Similarly, the crab thermidor was packed with chunks of crab. It was served with a rich, creamy sauce and served on a bed of orzo. However, the citrus flavor was a little bit strong for my palette.</Review>

Some beautiful outside seating here. What a view! Enjoyed a bottle of Albirino from Spain. Crisp white light wine. Perfect for a warm day. We shared calamari, crab cakes, beet salad and clams on garlic toast    Every item was delicious. And our server this sweet native of France was so delightful.< /Review>

<text>I tried the mixed seafood grill. Very good fish, especially the shrimps, among the best I ever had. Service was very good and I didn’t have to wait for a table since I chose the cocktail lounge. 4 stars because is a bit overpriced for the amount (39$). Plus there is a 4% gratuity on top of normal tipping.<//text>< pics>

With so many of the iconic restaurants in the heart of the tourist area closed I was lucky to find Scoma. Sat indoors in the dining room. It was intimate and well appointed. Service!  This was old world service. I can't remember the last time I had service this attentive to detail and my dining experience. The food was excellent. The dining selection is broad and the Chardonnay I selected was perfect. The food was excellent. Scallops were expertly seared, shrimp cocktail was delicious, risotto was just right, dessert snd coffee were an indulgent experience. I loved the entire experience and highly recommend this treasure just steps away from the commercial clatter of the high traffic tourist spots.<//review>

This is one of the top restaurants I’ve ever been to and definitely our favorite from our San Francisco trip.  Absolutely everything our party of 11 ordered we loved. You can’t go wrong with any of their dishes.

The service was also impeccable.  If you’re a dessert person try the seven layer cake.

Their seafood is top notch but if you’re a red meat fan their steak was also extremely good.</text>

It had been over six months since I had had a meal at a restaurant or made a reservation. With the sun shining, the idea of enjoying a cold crab salad overlooking the water appealed to me. Plus it's a nice image thinking of Al Scoma creating a family business 50+ years ago and having a pier named after him. Could such a story unfold for a scrappy go-getter these days?

We were a few minutes early for our lunch reservation, so we took the time to enjoy the view of the water and the mosaic ode to the city outside. Definitely easy to appreciate on a warm day. A few minutes later, we were seated at a picnic style table and received sourdough bread and whipped butter, and glasses of ice water.

Unfortunately, one of the glasses had remnants of red lipstick on it. We brought it to our server's attention, and later on, he replaced our water. Without a word, he took the glass and walked away. I couldn't help thinking it would have been nice if he had shown some sign of remorse. I understand that dishwashers can leave behind residue, but given these especially germaphobic times, a little sign of concern for the patrons from the staff goes a long way.

$13 Crab Bisque Bowl:
This orange bowl had a creamy tomato flavor with chunks of crab meat, topped with chives and cracked pepper.

$21 Scoma's Dungeness Crab Cake:
A pair of lightly battered and fried crab medallions were served with a small portion of arugula salad on the side and some creamy dipping salad. The crab was still chunky, which was definitely a plus, because that definitely beats crab cakes with pulverized crab mush.

$47 Scoma's Crab Louis Salad "Classic" 1/2 lb:
I knew the Crab Louis was going to be a large portion, even with the smaller "Classic" sized portion, but when I saw the plate set down in front of me, I knew we would have leftovers. The pile of crab meat sat on top of shredded lettuce, decked out with juicy heirloom tomatoes, cucumber slices, a boiled egg, bell peppers, carrots, olives, lemon wedges, and a ramekin overflowing with Louis dressing. It was cool and refreshing, not to mention the crab and the accoutrements were sweet and satisfying. My only complaint was I would have preferred if the carrot were peeled, because the outer layers looked a touch hairy.
I happily packed up the leftovers and looked forward to digging into it for my next meal. Our server joked that we did a good effort, but ate too much of the salad, haha.

I thoroughly enjoyed the food, and I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I had the opportunity to witness seeing the 'Pier to Plate' process unfold. I would rate my experience a 7/10, and would be more of a solid 4/5 had it not been for the dirty glasses. I wish I could say that I will save myself the money and make my own Crab Louis, but I sure do appreciate someone else shelling all that crab.< /text>

Came for lunch and enjoyed it. They serve a good range of Italian and seafood dishes.

Seafood was fresh. Pasta was ok tasting but came in huge portions - if you are a small eater, one between two people is enough. Clam chowder was delicious.

Service was great. The seating was a bit small so it was not that comfortable.</Review>

A great restaurant a little off the beaten path on Fisherman's Wharf. That is they own their own boats and seafood processing facility across the street. Excellent seafood prepared extremely well! By the way they also make craft cocktails including a Bloody Mary made with house made gin. There are so many places to choose from but even at lunch hour in the middle of the week, this restaurant is very busy. Scoma's was recommended by our cabbie a lifelong resident of San Francisco. Locals surely know it and we were happy that we followed his advice.</Review>

Delicious Fish n Chips!  The batter is made the traditional way. The food is made fresh by order. The portions are generous. My daughter and I shared one order and it was plenty to eat.

Picnic tables are available for seating in front.

This place is a nice addition to the Fisherman's Wharf eateries!</Text>

Well we thought we were going to have a nice dinner experience for our 17th yr anniversary but what we got was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, we were seated in an area where the doors were open its was super cold that we had to wear our coats while dining, when asked if we could have an empty boothe we were refused and were told this was all that was available, hummm that's funny the boothe was left empty the whole time we were there, i don't get it me and my wife pick this establishment for our anniversary dinner and informed them threw our reservation, totally no thought as to seat us to enjoy the experience, the frist drinks were their mule drink that tasted like medicine had to spit out and refuse them.the limes were like old and dried like it had been left out in the sun ,in closing this is not anywhere near a five star restaurant, i would never ever eat there nor suggest it to anyone. I we don't mind paying for anything as long as you get what you pay for .....🙁👎👎👎< /text>

< review>
We were in seafood heaven! Both the seafood entree and mains were mouth-watering and divine. We couldn't get enough! They matched well with a local chardonnay and the Pisco Punch cocktail. To top it off we had the delicious tiramisu. It was a perfect evening at Scoma's - delightful ambience with excellent and attentive service. Hands down the best meal we had on this trip!
Tip: Make a reservation to avoid waiting for a table (even on a week night) as this place is very busy.</review>

This place is very rustic and classic! Great place with excellent food! We ordered their shrimp, squid, and crab fried rice. It was so delicious! The taste was amazing and unique in flavors. This is our new favorite Thai restaurant in the city. They also have a unique design and excellent service. I will definitely come back and have that charcoal baby octopuses. Tasty!< /Text>

Highly recommend visiting the restaurant. The service was awesome and the food was delicious. If you are at Fisherman wharf definitely stop by but it’s best to make reservations at least a day in advance.< /Text>

What's good: Clamp chowder soup is delicious and crab was well cooked that maintains the freshness. Great stuff.

Mediocre... Oyster was not fresh. Definitely not worth the money.

What's bad:  Very disappointed with the freshness of the mussels. Filled with ammonia taste.

What's unacceptable: Do not appreciate the jokes of  the waiter who took our order.. sounded condescending to me.</review>

Food was very good and very high quality.  Be prepared to wait a while unless you have reservations.  It’s not cheap in any sense - food and cocktails are outrageously priced.  But you knew that already :-)  would’ve given it 5 stars, however two out of three dishes needed salt DESPERATELY.  I know salt is subjective, but as someone that does a lot of cooking I feel like the cook didn’t use any on those dishes.< /review>

<text>Came for lunch and enjoyed it. They serve a good range of Italian and seafood dishes.

Seafood was fresh. Pasta was ok tasting but came in huge portions - if you are a small eater, one between two people is enough. Clam chowder was delicious.

Service was great. The seating was a bit small so it was not that comfortable.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPx6LIGzS3fZJHupAsFJ7V_zHPvYVjJtsRtNIuq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT4ieqiBGqSl2XUPtmNqp-01qiNiumKFgf5ygX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeltYlkWhH8aYCTTwT6tYAfsUZyphBlIIrEwC-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_C161Q8859NDnOcF43Zx1mAieQTskIR9WLLD_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7nMWGw7lFeC5maSKma_AFtv2AmR8SpUUKqNdj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7uEDBliOx1T97UZJVA0ThWhzhc8YKrnbiQbEl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTHapLN_ZJeYhRONpJ4SwLP2HtGmPQJILfT4py=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwieqovdUP8Mct-TGXZaJopj_6O6HNbfZnEqVK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_j_xhLTvfHWL8K0S7dxONRMJGboUq7n8Fnm4T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkZRqFzuMzBerGKJ4G-aUhDvt_j2bO5P5hsNQn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqPZkpJxh9oBVUc-YVosv9bpnuNCPhqqTmaXqM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7D-Z-V5yAOTht3Y8gTiJIae7jQuvjGW3JxskN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUi5y-ziD8QShylx4AF10PCE0_QwPFw13o0bIg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLjjFW5AH26rODGhBcv7kvou1_On21Ds0QwzzJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWvUzpGk7D9dY0erdsnvPWtZTITQLp4TRgKLE3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLNc6XNmgtDV6uN_8XFku1w6zgffWI9JBTjEiQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2E7iBMqkYc5FHdQ9bSJEU5BjF5aUxAK0uWm5f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPim02haZP2_uoB458ZhimJOSQ8LHF8GIUBA4OM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbd736uE4ZNhkUCtOti8nIwBX9P7T9iMp8mxNH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcp0HO6j9YMt9mM4ic55LsCbtJOQldpIELM053=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmKW4s9H4hUO_Fivz8RGoJbGO8pQsl6qgXH4Xb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcPyvbtVAu4sSjXZ3_wsLSt4OF2uplnhbdg8TR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9BX6GGK2o22fPg2f2PY9x1-vP8vCeUdV7jAxD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORUY6V1uCPndpAtNtk-Nx1H0qemQxIW4NPgXQQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPROQoHLyqrZX1k53kG-NAfHvTgalYCkNzBW4Lz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgwThnNNK681R3Rclq5WSZHckual3c4PmXMloU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Sat indoors in the dining room. It was intimate and well appointed. Service!  This was old world service. I can't remember the last time I had service this attentive to detail and my dining experience. The food was excellent. The dining selection is broad and the Chardonnay I selected was perfect. The food was excellent. Scallops were expertly seared, shrimp cocktail was delicious, risotto was just right, dessert snd coffee were an indulgent experience. I loved the entire experience and highly recommend this treasure just steps away from the commercial clatter of the high traffic tourist spots.< /text>< Resp>

< review>
What An AMAZING Experience! My mom and I just finished what I believe to be the best service we have ever had! From the moment we walked into Scoma’s to the moment we left, we were treated with the most warm and wonderful service. The food (fresh caught) was unbelievable! Please do yourself a favour and just order the Crab, hot, in garlic and lemon butter! You will feel like you’re floating on a cloud. I would like to say Thanks again to Our phenomenal server David, you are one of a kind. We will most definitely be back for many years to come!<//review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>My girlfriend and I were visiting SF and in one place this restaurant was highly recommended to us.  It was a shame to have such a bad experience despite how beautiful this place looks.  The first thing was the poor attention of the waitress, she took the order three meters away, I had to choose a little voice to take my order, besides that she had no interest in explaining the menus well.  Then my girlfriend asked for a salmon and it was raw, this situation was very unpleasant, they offered us to reconcile it but she did not want to continue eating, not even the waitress herself apologized.  not if all this had to do with the time I decided to go, it was like 8:00 pm.  My girlfriend went to the bathroom and it was very dirty.  the truth is that all this is a shame for this well located place.  Hopefully it will improve a bit since the services are not cheap at all, I find it expensive and of very low quality.  I think I would think twice to return here.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Excellent dinner spot. I'm still salavating looking at my salad from this evening. If you find yourself in San Francisco, then Scoma's is an excellent restaurant that I highly recommend.

Pictured here is the Roasted Beet Salad (Salt Roasted Red and Golden Beets withAvocado, Orange, Aged Balsamic & Fresh Horseradish) along with the Halibut and veggies.< /review>

Be prepared to spend some money here. Ask for the DIPLOMATICO plate which they removed from the menu but still make it. It was a wonderful experience.<//Text>

Enjoyed the fresh cod. The lemon aioli was amazing! The “seasonal vegetables” on the plate was a frozen diced veggie blend. A little to be desired for the price point. But overall a good experience. Lovely sunset dinner over the Bay; much quieter and less crowded than Pier 39.< /review>

A friend suggested this restaurant to me and I'm so glad she did! First of all, the staff was amazing. They were very friendly and, helpful with suggestions.
Had an amazing margarita to start and had the trio for 2 as an appetizer which includes, calamari, crabcakes and bacon wrapped scallops. Now I am usually not a fan of seafood beyond calamari but the crabcakes were amazing and came with a delicious dipping sauce. Also had a delicious caesar salad.
I had the filet as an entree with asparagus with lemon and it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. One of the best dinners I've had in quite a while.<//Review>

Darn good seafood! Cocktail was a true delight as well. Great service for a big group as well. Incredible location featuring a large seemingly endless length of restaurant. Very cozy! Great views of SF in any direction. Believe it or not I’m a 40 year old man who had never eaten an oyster in his life, that all changed at Scoma. I was wary but they were delightful! If you’re up this way doing that tourist thing AND you live seafood, then this right here is your spot!</Text>

<review>Been coming here for years. I like this place better than the Sausalito location. We celebrated our 38yr anniversary. My wife wanted to eat here. Cesar salad,  Crab Brisq soup, spicy sauteed calamari, Lazy man's Cioppino and Cod special!!! All was YUM!!!

< Review>
Very fresh seafood that they say is sourced from the local fishermen and fisheries. They're generous with the butter and everything is consistent. The first time I came here, I had the louie salad, which was extremely basic. My latest return I tried out their seafood pastas and it was so rich I could die. Definitely something you need lots of bread for, but worth trying. Interior is a little bit nautical and storied with the waiters being attentive and checking in often. It's a bit on a the pricier side, but worth the price.<//Review>

Fantastic service, fantastic food and large serving sizes.
Good conversation with the serving staff too.

Small 15-20min wait for a walk in customer, which was fine. It allowed us to have a couple of drinks at one of the 2 front bars in the meantime prior to our meal.

Would recommend.<//text>

Scoma's has the best crab Louie salad I have ever had anywhere. Their seafood is the freshest, purchased right off the boats steps away from the kitchen. Atmosphere was absolutely amazing. The scallops were perfection as was the calamari.

Everything is fantastic at Scoma's. This is a must if you are in San Francisco, excellent Clam chowder, Caesar salad, and freshest sea food you can get. We love it here, family favorite!

Easy to walk to. It's tucked away from the per noise. The atmosphere reminded me of old San Francisco, dark wood, nice comfy bar stools.

The food and service was Great. And they were able to accommodate the large party of diners that were in attendance with us. Definitely recommend reservations. The food was excellent, the wine selection was superb, and the service was efficient and professional. Highly recommend.< /Review>

Seafood is incredibly fresh. All seafood i got are local sourced, wild caught, fresh! Mixed seafood grill(King Salmon, Alaskan Wild Halibut, Wild Cod, Shrimp)is one of my recommendations! I can tell the difference between wild caught and farm raised.
Fish is just falling apart on my tongue. It is Zero effort to chew!<//Text>

<review>I've eaten here twice in this trip and both times the food and service were fantastic.
The second time we enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the interactions between the staff who truly seem like a family - with some waiters driving 2 hours to work there!
Candace and Steve behind the bar deserve a big shout out, looking after us, keeping us entertained and giving us Thanksgiving weekend recommendations :)< /review>< pics>

<Review>I love this place. Quintessential San Fran seafood spot. 3rd time here. Waiters are all very professional and provide the best service.

Fantastic seafood and cool location off the beaten path a little and in a boat harbor.

I like the intimate atmosphere. Make your reservations WEEKS in advance.

If you have never been here... you really should try it.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0bMNZQ_swPgncjnMOc4RJWvf5UsqAw0X5PDXl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

< review>
On a work trip after a full day. We ate dinner here. It was one of the few dining options available to get us out of our hotel room.

They had extra tables setup where parking used to be. So we ate outside. The view was awesome. The service was top notch.

Drinks. Delicious. I had the smoked maple old fashioned. My dining mate (and friend and coworker) had a Southern Comfort and 7up.

Dinner (we couldn't fit dessert) was the grilled king salmon over Scomaronia and the Cioppino.

We ordered a couple apps too. Dungeness crab, oysters and shrimp. All good. All gone.

We so enjoyed our dinner here!

Thank you team Scoma!!

Hopefully you are able to get a new boat soon!!<//review>

We dined here last weekend.  The lazy man's Cioppino was fantastic.  The service was superb as well.  It's a shame the pandemic has hit them so hard.  There were only a few tables occupied for dinner.  We'll go back for sure,on our next trip to San Francisco.<//text>

If you want to have a good seafood experience not in the 'tourist' area, this is your go place! The food is great and the atmosphere too. But be aware it is a 'posh' place, a bit expensive (around 50 dollars per person) and it is advisable to make a reservation.</Review>

Kinda hidden from the Main Street, Scoma's is a restaurant that you need to go!
I'm the kind of person who says don't like fish, but after trying it here I change my mind!!! The worst part is that now, anything thAt I taste will always be comparable to this one!!!
Highly recommended!< /Review>

<review>Waiting about an hour on a weekday evening to be seated for dinner. Extremely busy restaurant which impacts the service quality. The service was decent but they could do better.

Food:
Cioppino: generous amounts of fresh dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, scallops, squid, and mussels in a fresh tomato sauce. The thing that suprised me was it was pretty much all seafood and loads of it. The tomato sauce was quite plain though.

Oysters alla Scoma: rockafeller style with cheese. A bit too sour for me but my buddy enjyoed it.

Scoma’s Famous Clam chowder: solid chowder and nice junks of seafood but I’ve had better in SF

Overall a nice experience and loved the fresh seafood.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-aO0EA9U8ket_AZCYTjwgnHVNmAHaPlXnRKho=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU5UUpiB0Z-E2SuQwf12U3zqfNbaRA7KYsrPTQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI0vG-mxvgviFC61GJNy61_q9dlmOFfdQ6-zNc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My boyfriend had a few requests for his birthday dinner.  He wanted seafood, and to be near the water, at preferably an Italian restaurant. Did I forget to mention he has NCGS- non celiac gluten sensitivity. My quest to meet those demands led me to Scomas. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. My boyfriend had the Wild "Troll-Caught" Alaskan Salmon with
Whole Roasted Carrots, Asparagus, Shelled Peas, and asparagus Purée which was gluten free, and I had the Prawns and Scallops alla Gannon, with asparagus, spinach and rice. We also ordered mixed Shellfish Platter for two. Everything was delicious, and my bf enjoyed his birthday.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Not worth it. The view from the dining room is not that great. The chowder is decent. The calamari didn’t taste fresh and had a thick batter on it. Prices were very high. The kids burger was decent but you can get one just as good at in n out for a 1/3 of the price. This is an old school place with old school food. If that’s what you like then you’ll probably like it but if your a millennial then it’s not your jam.< /Review>< Response>

<Date>1582006723932</Date><Resp>None</Resp><Review>I have deliberated greatly whether to give it 3 or 4 stars.  The ambience is cozy and location is 5 stars and entering this delightful blue and white cottage you're transported to a time when you would be served something wonderful straight from the trawler at the "old" fisherman's wharf. I ordered the spaghetti marinara, my husband the mixed grill and my kids each ordered the fish and chips. I will declare I am Italian so perhaps I'm being harsh... but i thought my food was so so. The portions were very generous and no one left hungry but the food itself, not spectacular.  The service so so and I'm being generous. Perhaps it's because we brought the kids (not exactly a family restaurant) or maybe because we didn't order alcohol but i just felt we got average, perfunctory service. This is what really let it down for us. We ended up tipping 30% anyway ... but we wont be back. Sorry.</Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I was looking for a nice place to eat on the bay, but the restaurants on Fisherman's Wharf looked way too touristic to me. I opted for this more hidden restaurant and I've been positively surprised. First, the staff is super friendly and welcoming. Then the atmosphere, very "marine" with all the wood. Last but not least, the food is great! Fresh fish from the bay, with many different options available. Wasn't expecting this quality. Sure, is not the cheapest option around, but if you want to eat well this i's the place to go!<//Review>

Food was very good and very high quality.  Be prepared to wait a while unless you have reservations.  It’s not cheap in any sense - food and cocktails are outrageously priced.  But you knew that already :-)  would’ve given it 5 stars, however two out of three dishes needed salt DESPERATELY.  I know salt is subjective, but as someone that does a lot of cooking I feel like the cook didn’t use any on those dishes.</review>

Excellent sea food and Italian food. Good wine selection. Prices are a little high but the place is above the rest as well.<//Text>

Easy to walk to. It's tucked away from the per noise. The atmosphere reminded me of old San Francisco, dark wood, nice comfy bar stools.

The food and service was Great. And they were able to accommodate the large party of diners that were in attendance with us. Definitely recommend reservations. The food was excellent, the wine selection was superb, and the service was efficient and professional. Highly recommend.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Kind of overrated as far as the fish... It was ok but I was surprised that my dish was deep fried - seems like a cop-out, and it was really dry. I would 100% come back for their amazing afogato (best I've ever had!), the cocktails (best negroni!) and the service.<//review>

<Review>Kind of overrated as far as the fish... It was ok but I was surprised that my dish was deep fried - seems like a cop-out, and it was really dry. I would 100% come back for their amazing afogato (best I've ever had!), the cocktails (best negroni!) and the service.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I would give this place NO STARS if the site would let me!

Up until tonight, I always loved this place. In fact, I had made a commitment to patronize local restaurants that remained open during the Shelter in Place order to help them during this crisis. Scoma's was one of those places. I had ordered "curbside delivery" a couple of times, no problem. Drive up, someone comes out, takes your card, goes inside and runs the check, and then comes right back with your bill to sign and your bag of food. And away you go. I might add that the service was always masked and gloved.

So tonight, I called in an order, arrived in my car at the time I said I would be there. Someone was there to tell me where to park, and there I sat with absolutely no acknowledgement from the staff inside for the next 15 minutes! Meanwhile, there was a birthday party going on right in front of me, and they received two full food deliveries while I was sitting there!

The same parking guy walked by again and I finally got his attention. He went in to check on my order, and a girl came and informed me that I had to COME INSIDE AND PAY to get my order - OH REALLY? SINCE WHEN? What happened to the "curbside delivery" that you have advertised on your website, and that I've patronized at least twice without any problem? She then informed me that it was because I called my order in rather than ordering online - RIGHT! I called my orders before without any problems, so I knew that wasn't it. She finally admitted that they were busy - evidently too busy to handle the transaction as advertised. OK, well then I'm too busy to be your customer! I told her to skip it and drove away without my order.

So this is how you treat your neighborhood patrons who were loyal to you during the SIP? Suddenly the SIP order's relaxed and  you're letting people into your restaurant to order and pay, and people are standing around in the parking lot, less than six feet apart and no masks, partying and getting all your service. I see. And now I hope some of my neighbors will see, too. SHAME ON YOU. If that's how you're going to treat loyal customers, then you will never get my business again. SHAME. ON. YOU!<//Review>
<pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1592259196011, 'text': "Hi Stefanie. Thank you so much for your kind words on always loving us and we greatly appreciate your efforts to support us during the SIP. We're happy to know your two initial curbside delivery experiences went so well, but please accept our apologies for the items you described on your most recent visit. We looked into what happened there and unfortunately it was a perfect storm of getting slammed and not having the proper training for the staff that was on hand at the time. We do happily offer curbside service and do handle the transactions as advertised. It will not happen again. Next time you order or come by, please introduce yourself so we can apologize in person and make sure you have a 100% perfect experience. Thank you and we look forward to serving you again."}<//Response><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Delicious food, great staff. If you don't know what to get try the seafood cioppino. A tasty classic. There are nice view of the harbor boats from the restaurant. I ate at the bar are the service was professional and friendly. The bar tender showed me the menu and popular items. There is a lot to choose from and I was unsure and he recommended a few items. When I tried to add an app he suggested an alternative because it would simply be too much crab meat. He did so curteously and I'm glad I followed his advice. Valet parking is available if you are driving.</Review><Date>1526148288519</Date><username>Andrew Halloran<//username>< user_id>

It's a pier after all. Now they want to stop the boats from being there and that's very unfair. These are hard times for everyone we all need to innovate and yes they might need some more outdoor space but also be reasonable and share. I would like to hear a reasonable explanation from the new management.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1592089091527, 'text': 'Catherine, please know Scoma\'s is perhaps the biggest supporter of the local fishing fleet in the entire city. We are more than happy to have any fishing boat being on the pier and several do. We have been letting FV Pioneer sell seafood in our parking lot, which we pay for, at no cost to them. We have no ability, desire or authority to put anyone out of business, and the Pioneer could easily move to a different slip if it wanted to.\n\nIt is an unfortunate situation but we have well over 100 employees, many local fishing crews and countless farmers whose livelihoods depend on our being able to conduct business. After offering several solutions to the FV Pioneer no agreement could be reached.\n\nPlease read this unbiased statement from the Port of San Francisco if you are interested in knowing the facts of the situation.\n\nThank you for your feedback we we hope this response and the Port\'s statement below gives you clarity on the situation.\n\nStatement issued by the Port of San Francisco yesterday:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\n\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\n\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\n\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nFor additional information please contact the Port of San Francisco Public Affairs Office.'}< /Response><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1582507558976</Date><Resp>None<//Resp><review>I'm a local, and I eat on the San Francisco waterfront often. This is definitely one of the best meals I've had near the Pier 39 / fisherman's wharf area.

Fried calamari was very good, although it could have been just a touch more crispy.

Crispy fries with truffle oil and parmesan cheese were out of this world.

The beet salad was small for the price, but tasted amazing.

The bread roll tasted fresh, but it was not warm.

Service was fast and friendly. I was dining alone and I got one of the tables facing out toward the fishing boats.

The location makes this one of those places that you will not stumble onto. You must see the sign and walk toward the Bay down the pier.

The restaurant is like time stopped in 1965, but it's clean and well-maintained inside.

food is expensive, but not over-the-top expensive. I ordered three appetizers, calamari, crispy fries, and the beet salad. And with two diet Pepsi's it came to $51, before tip.

I will definitely be back here.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//GmapID>< rate>

i dined here one evening with my mom while in town for a quick weekend away. we showed up with no reservation and sat at the bar until we were able to be seated. we ordered a drink at the bar and enjoyed the area while waiting. there's a really nice bar. the drinks are a bit pricey though. we were seated and our waitress took our order quickly. i ordered the meal that had 3 types of fish and it was great. the fish was really fresh and cooked well. i would recommend!</text>

Best seafood meal I've ever had. It's just as good as everyone says it is. Fresh catch daily, superb dining, the food coma afterwards was divine!</review>

<Text>Fantastic view coupled with some of the most succulent dishes I've had the pleasure of partaking. The staff is kind and courteous, and considerate in their accomodations. Just be sure to order two clam chowers by the dish if you plan on sharing.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Came for lunch on a whim with no reservations (I recommend doing otherwise!) we were able to grab a seat at the bar. Had delicious chowder, crab and more! We saw a few seals swimming around outside too! Service was excellent and price is really what you would expect for the high quality of food you’re getting and it’s also San Fran so yah know.</Text>

Walked in without a reservation during a business trip. They had a bit of a wait but we found a few seats at the bar and only had one round before our table was ready. Nice surprise as I was expecting to wait much longer. Ordered the mixed seafood grill and a bottle of wine and was very pleased with everything. Service was great as well. Will make sure to come back on future trips to San Francisco.< /Text>

Nice place to sit down, relax and order everything on the menu you can afford. We sat next to the bar watching SF Giants play LA Dodgers on a Sunday afternoon in June after camping in Yosemite National Park.</Review>

Got here around 6pm dinner time, no waiting, got seated right away, got served right away, and drinks brought very quickly, ordered bowl of chowder for appetizer, and for the main we ordered lazy man's cioppino  and pasta puttanesca, very delicious but both dish taste similar in a tomato-ey way, still delicious, the prawn is just outta this world, seafood taste really fresh, service is great, price is incredibly high, about 110$ for two, yet great service, great food, great view, have that fancy vibe, great experience overall< /text>

<review>New Year’s Eve we got a table in the afternoon.  The place is a grand slam from start to finish.  The staff is so accommodating and pleasant.  I understand most of the staff members have decades of service.  Our server was absolutely wonderful!  Scoma’s seafood is about as fresh as it gets and the cooking was perfect.
I had the cioppino in a tomato stock .  Loved it.  Loved everything about this place.  Can’t wait to get back.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Nice atmosphere and the staff was extremely polite and accommodating. The crab cakes were not as palate pleasing as we had expected. They were somewhat small. Definitely had better. Soup was good.< /text>

Good but way too expensive, small portions. More than $30 dlls for that small cold seafood platter with 4 Oysters, 4 Shimps and a little bit of Crab, is a rip off!< /Review>

We always accept walk ins but the wait time can change minute by minute as people arrive constantly. It sounds like you enjoyed your time at the bar with Mikey and in most cases, when a party chooses to eat at the bar they are taken off the wait list for a table so we don't interrupt their meal to move them. Please accept our apologies if there was a mixup. Hopefully we'll have the chance to serve you again some day for what we're certain will be a perfect visit.

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>A good friend highly recommended this establishment.  When my husband phoned about reservations, he was assured that we could walk-in without a wait. Upon arrival, we were told that there would be a wait of 30-45 minutes. This was after a party of 6 walked up immediately before us without a reservation and was seated. We then went to the bar to wait on our table.  Mikey the bartender was kind and efficient and those at the bar were so nice that we eventually chose to eat there. We were practically done with our meal when we were notified that our table was ready. Mikey tried to cover for the mistake but obviously those assigning tables did not care to us.  Given our $200 bill, it was not worth it. Never again.<//Text><Time>1569223577502</Time><userid>105164023479358395574</userid>< GmapID>

Yesterday was the first time we came to that magnificent restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We had a good time with the excellent service, with the high quality  dishes and wine and with the honest pay. We will definitely return there again.<//Review>

The best crab louie salad and clam chowder in the City, period.  And that says a lot given the number and quality of the competition.  The waiters are always super social; so we always have a great time when we go.</Review>

Good staff and fresh seafoods on there. In addition, they provided a variety of wine lists and you can choose one that you like.
Because there is located in the central of fisherman's Wharf, I felt a little pricy than I expected. Recommended.<//review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>The food at Scoma’s is quite simply phenomenal- the scallops are the best I’ve ever eaten and the halibut was perfectly cooked and accompanied. The only downside was the service - which was bad- our server spoke maybe ten words to us in total - we had to ask for our starter plates to be cleared (after our mains had arrived) and for fresh cutlery. We still had a wonderful meal as nothing can detract from the food here - but clearing tables, a smile and couple of friendly words makes a difference between a good and a great experience.</review>< Pictures>

Had the mixed grill (black cod, ling cod, salmon, and shrimp with orzo). It was delicious! And the service was great. Our waiter was fantastic and no one rushed us when we chatted after we finished. Hope to go back soon.</text>

Wonderful restaurant in Fisherman Wharf, serving fresh fish. The service was fast and efficient. We have the plat de mer and half-crab salad, both were delicious. The pictures on stars/customers on the walls.</review>

Service was fantastic. Our server was a seasoned pro, exceedingly polite and knowledgeable. The crab bisque is very good, and the grilled halibut may be the best I've ever had.
Do yourself a favor and call ahead, there's going to be a wait.
A real old school classic.</Review>

Soooo good. This is the best place for Cioppino around.  It was extra cool that local fishermen were seated next to me at the bar who brought in some of the fish that day.< /text>

Loved finding this gem off the beaten path. The food was delicious. We are from New England and agree that the Clam Chowder was phenomenal! The service was excellent. Our server was Han Kim, I am not sure of spelling. She was so attentive and even funny. She made us feel comfortable and was very accommodating to our requests. Highly recommend and will be back if in the area.< /review>

The whole roasted crab was served in a lemon herb butter sauce: delicious! The bread was served cold (like from the refrigerator) which I thought was weird. I asked for it to be warmed up and was told no. So there's that...<//text>

Best sea food in SF hands down.  The place is classy with excellent service.  Prices are a tad high, but you get what you are paying for.  The food is absolutely delicious.  If you are craving for fish, this is the place to go.

The only downside to the restaurant is that it is a bit small, so I recommend reserving a table if you do not want to wait.< /review>

<Text>We have been coming to Scoma's during family visits to San Francisco practically since the restaurant opened in 1965. The setting on the wharf is very special, and the jacketed waiters are exactly the way I remember them back in the 1960s.  They are also very helpful and efficient!  The food is good, but it's really the whole experience that makes Scoma's such a treat.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Came here for dinner with my colleagues. They have a nice California craft beer list an extensive wine list (hot take: they also have a list available in Japanese). The service here was good. The food here was quite good. We all shared a seafood feast. The price point is about right for the area, that being said bring your wallet.< /Text>

The best crab louie salad and clam chowder in the City, period.  And that says a lot given the number and quality of the competition.  The waiters are always super social; so we always have a great time when we go.<//review>

<time>1566087965773<//time><review>I had a quick pre Birthday bite.  We just shared a salad and appetizers.  The crab cakes were delicious.  The calamari's corn meal breading was odd to me.  Not fine milled and I wasn't expecting the texture.  The bacon wrapped scallops were tasty but seemed warm. They would've been better with a little more heat...like a little sizzle or something.  The one thing I did enjoy but did not photograph was the Casa Margarita.  It would be one of the reasons I'd go back.  The atmosphere was nice and very old San Fran.  Although it is in the Wharf, it is a bit off the beaten track so you don't feel like you are hanging out with a bunch of tourists.  Many apologies if that offends, I just hate being with the masses.  I know...I should share such a wonderful city, but I'm selfish that way 😇.</review>< GmapID>

Good meal, especially considering it is in the middle of the most touristy part of SF. Decor is from a different time and staff are attentive. The Dungeness crab cakes are a good starter and black cod for main.< /Text>

<review>Ordered four different dishes with the family, all came out great quality. Staff we met were very friendly and welcomed us as tourists. This place is so good, the popularity would probably require a reservation on busy days! Luckily, we did have a reservation, and we got seated right when we walked in.< /review>< Pics>

In my opinion this has to be one of the best restaurants in the US. Tucked away down a small street at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, Scoma's is like finding buried treasure. The restaurant itself is not overly ostentatious but the warm friendly staff make you feel imediately welcome.
I tried out Fettucine “Pomodori Secchi e Pollo”. Now I have eaten Pasta dishes in around 16 countries, including Milan, Italy. I have to say, this was the best chicken pasta dish I have ever tasted. It was sublime. Its no surprise, whereever you look that this particular restaurant has reviews of 4.5 stars and over. My rating is a full 5* and that it is my number 1 restaurant in the US so far. If you are ever in the area don't miss an opportunity to pay Scoma's a visit.< /Review>

Everything is delicious, and the service is incredibly top notch ❤️ This place is definitely the best of the best as far as local seafood restaurants. However, their food is, in my opinion, overpriced by a noticeable margin. 2 crab cakes as an appetizer was very delicious, but not $21 delicious.</Text>

<name>Brandon Taylor</name><Review>It was our first time in SF & we had been craving clam chowder all day (at this point it had been a brisk evening) & Scomas absolutely delivered (figuratively speaking). Not only was their food delicious, but their customer service and employees were very cordial. Candace especially went above and beyond to say the least. Shoutout to Candace!!! To say she made our first experience with Scomas eventful is an understatement. When you mix flavor packed, good quality food with even better quality employees, you obtain long time customers. Definitely will be coming back here every time I visit SF.<//Review>< Resp>

<review>Very cool location on the Fisherman's Wharf. The drinks were great. I had a gin & prosecco drink with cucumber. It was delish.  The crab cakes were awesome too.  Everyone enjoyed their food...but beware that the menu on their website is NOT correct.  They did not have a dish that someone in our party wanted, even though the online menu showed it was available.</review>< pictures>

Wow, talk about fresh.  Our waiter (Chris) guided our group on a fantastical journey of fresh seafood.  The seafood trio sampler and bruschetta were simply amazing.  I ordered the mixed seafood grill (the daily fish were halibut, salmon, and black cod) and was probably some of the best fish I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Can be pricey, but you get a healthy, filling portion.  Highly recommend.<//text>

Beautiful view or a cannery row view with Ghirardelli in the background.

Jean Marc was our server. Gracious, welcoming,  knowledge, old school finesse. Loved him. Drinks, Bloody Mary was best out of all I've had, rich well blended flavors, dirty martini was well balanced and dirty. Every order from apps to dessert served well prepared and timely. Old school ambiance in a thoroughly modern world.<//text>

Clam Chowder was loaded with fresh clams and so good with no bacon. Calamari fritti was lightly coated with rice flour and tender. Caprisi salad with heirloom tomatoes and homemade mozzarella was fantastic. Cioppino was loaded with seafood and delicious. Wrapped it up with 7 layer Torta Setteveli cake; light, chocolatey and creamy. A new favorite instead of Tiramisu.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7QgQ9atUG1w0itRbnvbZvXj7fw1py3vK7Sn6j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Great location tucked away along the dock.  Old Italian style.  The steak was amazing.  The tri appetizer was great and loved by our 7yo and 9yo. We also had scallops and shrimp.  Our kids loved it all.  It was cooked nicely and our server was very nice.  I had a body Mary which was a tad lacking in pizzazz.  It was not worth the $15 they charged for it.  Other than that, it is a great restaurant and I highly recommend it!< /Review>

<text>Before going on our honeymoon, we were told by several people that all the places to eat at or around fisherman's wharf are essentially the same...while that isn't a bad thing, the sole exception is Scoma's. While all the seafood around the wharf is likely fresh, at Scoma's not only do you know it is but the service and preparation they put into each meal is unmatched. Our server dutifully told us exactly which dishes were locally caught and prepared fresh vs frozen. I started with the clam chowder and can honestly say it was one of the best I ever had. For entrees, my wife and I had the locally caught, fresh blackened cod.  Perfectly cooked and spiced, it was so good, I had to slow myself down to enjoy it more...as well as stop myself from just going caveman on it and eating it with my bare hands. Also, as a bonus, our awesome waiter (who had previously asked what brought us to San Fran after learning that we lived in NJ) brought us some incredible sorbet and ice cream to congratulate us on our marriage/honeymoon. This added an entire new level to our experience. When we are in San Fran again, we will definitely be returning!< /text><resp>None</resp><Name>Kevin Grim< /Name></record>

This was the first place we ate at after landing from Florida on our honeymoon. This historic restaurant has great views and dishes. We loved the chowder and crab cakes. On the back wall next to the harbor, you'll find a plethora of celebrity photos who have enjoyed this cuisine with you. I would highly recommend.</review>

<Review>I haven't been to Scoma's in about 5 years (I live in Texas), but it was and is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. And I have eaten in many of the finest restaurants in the U.S. I was wondering if Joey Scoma still frequents the facility. He was a big part of the Scoma's experience.</Review>< Rating>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I have only tried Scoma's once about a year ago (Apparently I forgot to leave a review at the time) and this past year I have thought about Scoma's over hundreds of times.

Every dish we ordered was beyond expectation and really became my default point of comparison when trying other restaurants. All the food was incredibly fresh and seasoned perfectly.

Service was absolutely fantastic and our server even gave us extra mini Tabasco bottles just by overhearing us talk about how adorable they were.

Our seating was unfortunately very small (right in the corner of the bar area) but truly a trivial matter when it comes to our great experience dining here.

Hope to visit again soon!</text>< pictures>

Great fresh seafood, professional and courteous waitstaff, and a fully stocked bar and wine cellar.  Definitely would visit again.< /Review>

Three is being generous. Traveling in San Francisco and Scoma's was highly recommended by our hotel staff and the glowing Google reviews. Our waiter, Timothy was less than interested in us as customers, not helpful in advising us on menu selections and overall, just a dud.  We should have asked to change to the waiter people nearby had- he was outgoing, knowledgeable and sold the menu items with skill and was not pushy. As for our entrees, my shrimp and scallops were OK, my client got the mixed grill which was over cooked and on a par with hotel banquet fare. Dessert was limited, and the tiramisu was suspiciously like what Olive Garden served. For nearly $200, this was disappointing. The salmon mac and cheese was actually great, so possibly I should have settled for this and a salad. We did enjoy the location and decor, and might (?) give Scoma's another try, with the hope this was just an "off" evening.< /Text>

Be sure to get the clam chowder, you will be happy you did.

Will be back for sure!<//text>< GmapID>

<Text>Let me start by saying coming from NY especially near many Italian and seafood inspired places I came in with very high expectations.  Although the food was good by many standards, it was not WOW.  Typical seafood fare, and flare.  Service was fast, courteous, and prices were what one would expect for the area and for seafood.  I had a plate of pasta and assorted seafood.  Seafood was fresh tasting and the pasta was good.  I also has a cup of the crab bisque which was very rich and filling- the highlight of the night.  My fiance had a grilled platter of assorted fish- which was light, flaky but nothing to rave about.  All in all, if you're in the mood for seafood I would recommend Scoma.  However, if you're in the mood for dishes incorporating seafood to set a new bar- I'd say try somewhere else.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Food is a 5 star.  Was excellent and the service was excellent as well.  Again 5 stars.  So why a 3 star rating.  I was seated in a small room in the back of the restaurant.  Attached to this room with no separation was a waiter service area.  You know coffee makers, drink machines.   Wasn't too bad until they started bussing table in the larger dining room and walking though the small dining room.  Then making a lot of racket racking and stacking dirty dishes.   If I wanted a nice view of a food prep area with a lot of noise I would have gone to Denny's.  I didn't complain during the meal as it was my wife's birthday and I didn't want to upset her my complaining.

With that said, food is good just watch out where they seat you.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//gmap_id><Response>{'time': 1557787479556, 'text': "Hi Anonymous.

< review>
I don’t dish out 5-star reviews often but this place deserved it. Incredible food and excellent service. As someone who comes from Europe and struggles with huge American portions, this place was reasonable when we ordered an appetiser to share and a starter each (came to about regular European portions). Recommend crab cakes - you get two with a little side salad/generous garnish, and the clam chowder (go for a bowl rather than a cup for a European ‘main’ size) and crab bisque.

Delicious, fresh, excellent! Usually recommended to reserve, we got lucky and walked in without a reservation. But a place this good will be busy - so either reserve or be prepared for a wait - it is worth it tho.<//review>

The absolute best white, creamy clam chowder. Delicious. Friendly staff and on the water ambiance. You won't find lots of potatoes as filler for the chowder here.< /Text>

This place is a MUST! My absolute favorite place to eat in San Francisco! The clam chowder is the best I've ever had. You can watch the fishing boats pull up and unload their catch as you dine. I've been eating here since I was a little kid. It hasn't changed a bit in 40 years.< /text>

<Text>I am from Massachusetts. Our limo driver in Boston suggested this place! All the way from Massachusetts someone was talking about this place. Location a 10! The food is all organic and the fish's wild and fresh. I got the halibut, my dad got the pasta Bolognese, and my mother and son at the scallops and shrimp. All dishes were a 10. The bread was excellent, and the service was a 10. We had Elizabeth. She was fun, efficient, and knowledgeable. We loved it here.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Prices at this place was a little on the pricier end but the food tasted amazing and even better was the table,seating and service. The views are gorgeous but might be a long wait for a good table. Bar area is great to grab a few drinks before your table is ready. I would dine here again! Loved it!< /Text>

The clam chowder was absolutely amazing, as was the bread. Once we were served anything we suddenly had no server or at least no recognizable server any longer. That would be my only complaint; service was lacking.<//text>

If you must visit Fisherman’s Warf, this is the spot to go! It is a gem amongst the tourist traps of the area. Grab a plate of oysters or the incredible clam chowder. It won’t disappoint.<//text>

First time there. The waiter was more than helpful describing the menu and place of origin of the food they serve. I had the shrimp and scallops, they were excellent. Next time I'm back on the wharf, without a doubt I'll be back at Scoma's.< /Review>

<text>Nice place to go every few years.  They have their own fishing boats so most of the  fish is fresh. Three of us went for a birthday and with an apetizer for three, a salad and a main course each, no drinks or desserts, it came to  $187.00 before tip.
The service was great and our waiter was very helpful and friendly, but it's not very affordable except for special occasions.< /text>< pics>

The crab bisque to start was outstanding. It was downhill from there. Shell bits in my crab cocktail. Shrimp was slightly over for main course but the scallops were perfect. Plating and vegetables with the main, straight from 1965 when they opened. Wait staff? All from 1965 too I think. Not attentive to diners around me, got hit in the shoulder without apology twice as they walked by, and no sense of urgency. Very fresh seafood is about all this place has going for them.< /Text>

We would have been happy to replace that for you. Also, we are sorry if you felt the service was not ideal. Many of our servers are career servers who are exceptional at their jobs and we usually hear great things about them, but we'd be interested in hearing more about your experience. Please message us with when you were in and where you sat, if possible so we can look into what may have happened.

{'time': 1592014141885, 'text': 'Vol, it seems like you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up. Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}< /response>

The crab thermidor is basically an overpriced mushroom casserole with virtually no crab and an overall earthy flavor due to being 90% mushrooms. Yet another shining example of how Bay area seafood is horribly outclassed by literally any and every hole in the wall on the Gulf coast. Scomas is probably fine if you've never had fish and only vaguely know what seafood is.<//Text>

Ordered some hot and cold plate appetizers and then the dungeoness crab. It was really messy but amazing! So much of the menu is brought in right from the docks and processed in a building steps away from the restaurant. The ambiance was classy and the servers were very friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. If you're looking for a good seafood option, this is a great choice away from the tourist traps.< /text>

The waiter was annoyed when we asked for a clean plate. The main course, Fish, was decent.. but for 2 people with 1 drink and no desert the bill was $120.. I got higher quality food at the quick serve walk up at the wharf! They must pay people do the reviews. Don’t go!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

My family and I were there yesterday, we got seated right away but it took 10min for a waiter to come to our table, he came because my uncle called him to clarify something on the menu. I wonder how long we would have waited if my uncle wouldn't have called. The guy looked at us as if he had no interest of serving us. I guess we were not his class of customers. We were treated very poorly.</review>

Worth the search.
The cioppino is fantastic
The Crab louis was split between 3 people and we still struggled to finish due to the generous portion. Highly recommended a visit.
Right out of the 70's decor.
Really cool find.

If you're looking for a fabulous meal this is the place.  Indescribably delicious!  Pricey but well worth it.  If you're going to Fisherman's Wharf, treat yourself.<//text>

I was recommended this place since I am visiting the area with family. All I can say is it’s definitely worth the wait and it’s very good food. Our waiter was very nice and came to find us when we were told a 30 minute wait. We got to sit next to the fireplace and look out at the water and see all the interesting fishing boats for the pier.
I had the fried combo platter which was delicious. The prawns and cod were cooked perfectly and were not heavy at all considering it’s a fried dish. Normally this dish comes with scallops but I cannot eat scallops and they very kindly swapped them out for more prawns.
This place is good for both locals and travelers. The cost is good for the fresh food you find here. Definitely recommended!< /text>

Waited two hours for a table after being told it would be a one-hour wait, there was a couple already seated at the first table they walked us to, the next they were literally setting up in the walkway for us. Ordered an appetizer but dinner came out first so never got to try it. Food was great, only reason for any stars, but not much better than the other places we dined during our stay.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Talk about service. Very nice, on the water. 5 star service.
Sonny was our server. He was very professional had lots of suggestions for first timers.
The Bar Tenders were very nice, but the drinks are typically light in Bay area quantity.
I get more for my money at the bars where I live.
This was a nice place for my Birthday. Really cool photos of famous Celebrities over the years who have dined there.
Great story about My Scoma, i enjoyed in the lobby
The food was delicious, well prepped.< /Text>

<Review>Discovered this place while visiting San Francisco. It is just off the main drag, so it is easy to miss, if you aren't looking for it, specifically. That is a good thing. The restaurant is quieter and much higher quality food than the places among the main road. The history behind this place is fascinating.

The seafood is fresh caught and delicious.

The staff was very friendly.

I did not have a reservation, but I arrived early enough that I only had about a 20 minute wait. Call ahead if you want to guarantee a timely seat.

I will definitely go back next time im in the city.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Probably the finest restaurant  in San Francisco.  The staff is very polite  and make you glad you came. The food is to die  for. The best seafood in the Bay Area. The chef's  do a great  job of preparing the food as you ordered lt. No ready made  meals here. Everything is cooked to order.  The restaurant  is very clean and neat. Top it all off they park your car for free. It's not cheap but we'll worth the price. I've been coming to Scoma's for over 50 years never been disappointed.< /text><name>Rick Ananos< /name><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Nice and clean polite manner of waiting staff.
Food was excellent.
$$$ is little higher but affordable.
One of best restaurant in fisherman's wharf San Francisco.
If you want to visit this place I recommend early time is wonderful.
If not you have to wait at least half hour.< /Review>

Great seafood! I had the fried platter with the prawns, scallops band fresh cod! It was served with fries and a small side of slaw. I didn't care for the slaw, but everything else on the plate was delicious! Our waiter was friendly and provided us with excellent service. I

Amazingly fresh and seasonal menu.  Cannot go wrong with the crab cakes but also a well prepared filet with grits instead of a potato base.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  5 stars if service was better for the smaller tables. Food is well worth any wait.</Review>

Food was pretty good but the service ruined our experience. Thomas was our server and was rude to our group the moment we sat down. Being from the industry we were all pretty disappointed.<//Review>

I was conducting my San Francisco Photo Tours for my Florida clients and a Lyft Driver recommended Scoma's for the best clam chowder in San Francisco. The restaurant was hard to find but we finally found it. Service was real slow when we arrive like 9 pm. It was busy and we finally got our clam chowder. Lots of black/white celebrity photos on the wall. And also the Bar area was really nice and quiet and luxurious.  This place has history and prices are $$$ so be sure to have at least $ 100 in your wallet. It's worth a visit on your next trip to San Francisco<//Text>

< Review>
We have been coming to Scomas for decades. We moved away from CA to N. Carolina, so we came to eat on a visit back. The food was fantastic and our service was impeccable as always. We asked for special orders from the old menu, which they made for us. I am glad they are now committed to sustainability, but the prices had gone up a lot and the portion sizes have gone down. The price increase, along with the smaller portions is the reason for 4 stars rather than 5. I can see one or the other, but not both. The price increase for the seafood saute was 30%!< /Review>

Outstanding food and service!!! We actually didn't know where to eat and some nice man on the street recommended Scoma's. It pays to be brave to ask a complete stranger for a dinner recommendation!! The food was crazy good and our server (Heather, I think) what quite honestly one of the best servers we ever had.< /Text>

Food: Calamari was overcooked and very tough. House seafood soup was delicious. There was a lot of food in the Poor Man's Chopionno. I don't think it was worth it for the money paid though.

Atmosphere: Right on the docks. Feels like it

Service: Pretty Good< /Review>

I was conducting my San Francisco Photo Tours for my Florida clients and a Lyft Driver recommended Scoma's for the best clam chowder in San Francisco. The restaurant was hard to find but we finally found it. Service was real slow when we arrive like 9 pm. It was busy and we finally got our clam chowder. Lots of black/white celebrity photos on the wall. And also the Bar area was really nice and quiet and luxurious.  This place has history and prices are $$$ so be sure to have at least $ 100 in your wallet. It's worth a visit on your next trip to San Francisco</Review>

Food: Calamari was overcooked and very tough. House seafood soup was delicious. There was a lot of food in the Poor Man's Chopionno. I don't think it was worth it for the money paid though.

Atmosphere: Right on the docks. Feels like it

Service: Pretty Good</Text>

My go to place in San Francisco.  Go here, period. Service and foid are simply amazing. I have sent dozens of friends here and they all rave about it. Best thing is when i am kind of undecided, the waiter always makes something i love. IMO , best place in SF.< /review>

However, after visiting with my family, I can say that this place is worth a trip. The location out on the pier gives it a truly classic SF feel. Looking back at the city and out toward the Bay is spectacular. The decor is dated, but charming. The food is very good (but not great). Come to this place for the classic experience and you won't be disappointed.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Love this place!  came here over 10 years ago for the first time, and fell in love with  the food and the view. The walls of the restaurant are full of photos from the old days, gives you a great sense of history.  even after left the Bay Area, I always reserve some time to have a meal at Scomas. I have to admit that this restaurant never lets me down.<//Review>< Pictures>

The shrimp I just had here was rubbery and tasteless, vegetables (green beans and carrots) were undercooked.  Our family has been going to this restaurant since the 60's.  It has officially been removed from our list of "places to eat in SF". Oh, the clam chowder was amazing.</review>

I'm genuinely confused by how highly rated this is. Even for the fisherman's wharf or Pier 39, the food was pretty terrible. The clam chowder was alright if you could overcome the grittiness of what I assumed was poorly cleaned clams. I will say that the truffle fries were good, but slightly oily. I got the petrale dore, which was recommended by our waiter, and it was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this dish unless you like to pay $35 for oily, deep fried cardboard. The only redeeming thing on the plate was the tartar sauce, but that wasn't enough to cover the horrendous taste of the petrale. When I told the staff who took my staff that I didn't want leftovers a sit was just not good, nothing was done about it. Seriously, make the trek to Woodhouse, Waterbar, or anywhere on the grotto if you want good seafood.< /Text>

Always a great experience. The team in this restaurant is just as good as its food, which is a high standard to meet. When it's halibut season, order the halibut; otherwise go for the swordfish. You'll never be disappointed! Also, who doesn't love wine on tap???<//text>

Terrible bartender looked high. I ordered a salad, I was served 3 pieces of huge lettuce with 3 croutons. When I asked for balsomec vignette they gave me a cup of oil.Don't EVEN ask for steak sauce, they do not have any. The portions are smaller then ever. I love crab that is why I traveled 3 hours to eat THERE! Food is NOT WORTH $160.00</Review>

Y U M !
I bring any and all seafood lovers here. It is one of my happy places in San Francisco. Clam Chowder is a must for a start. Calamari is cooked almost perfectly every time - it has been over cooked before (reason for me giving 4 stars) I recommend ordering a whole crab with the garlic butter sauce on the side so it doesn’t drink down to your elbows like it did me. The cod dish is delicious, cooked to perfection, flavors are out of this world.<//review>

Nice restaurant near the pier. It’s somewhat hidden, and took us a while to find it. Their fish and chips from kids menu is surprisingly almost the same an adult one, in terms of size and taste!<//text>

Oh lord!  I can't remember what every item was called, but the best thing I had there was their take on oysters rockefeller.  I'm getting super hungry thinking about it.  All their apps were great.  As for the entrees, we ordered the clam pasta and roasted cracked crab.</text>

We found this famous gem of an eatery tucked away behind the gaudier offerings on the main drag. It lived up to its reputation. This was some of the best food we had had on our vacation. There are no chowders in bread bowls here. Only delicious, no-nonsense local fish dishes. The children’s meal was fantastic since it included not just fish and fries but also greens and carrots!  And, what’s more, it was served on an actual plate! (Unlike many children's meals.) It’s not cheap but it’s much better value than some other local restaurants. Would very highly recommend.<//review>

A must go seafood delight!  Been going for 25 years, love the Oysters Ala Scoma.  Great drinks with weekly new creations you should try. Huge wine selections.  Go with the fresh catch or their recommendations. The hard part is getting a seat but they take reservations! See you there! Just returned to the same excellent food this week.</Text>

<review>Got there in time for a fresh made caesar salad but the other salads weren't so fresh. Soups were good as always, my kids love the mac and cheese. Everything else was fine. Only noticable difference from other locations is the slowness in them clearing tables, they sat with dirty dishes  for some time before getting cleaned.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I'm genuinely confused by how highly rated this is. Even for the fisherman's wharf or Pier 39, the food was pretty terrible. The clam chowder was alright if you could overcome the grittiness of what I assumed was poorly cleaned clams. I will say that the truffle fries were good, but slightly oily. I got the petrale dore, which was recommended by our waiter, and it was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this dish unless you like to pay $35 for oily, deep fried cardboard. The only redeeming thing on the plate was the tartar sauce, but that wasn't enough to cover the horrendous taste of the petrale. When I told the staff who took my staff that I didn't want leftovers a sit was just not good, nothing was done about it. Seriously, make the trek to Woodhouse, Waterbar, or anywhere on the grotto if you want good seafood.< /Review>

This is an old school vibe seafood place with excellent food. We had the several appetizers, the clams, crab cakes, and scallops. It was the beginning of crab season so we ordered a few roasted crabs as well. Everything was very fresh and I'd recommend visiting.

Tip: there's free valet parking if you drive all the way up to the restaurant.< /Review>

we do not have the consent of the animals to eat them as good as lobster newburg tastes it is not right to eat them. there are vegan alternatives. i am an entrepreneur looking to make meat substitutes cheap and plentiful. we should get along with animals and teach them to communicate. we can grow lobster tails without killing their brains just to eat their tails< /Review>

A San Francisco icon. Still every bit as good as it was the last time I was there 35 years ago. We had the fried anchovie and calamari app, which was wonderful; the "Fritto Misto." The sauces that comes with it were special. The rest of the meal, and the service was perfection. Add the window seat, watching the seals playing in the water, and the charming, good-humored valet, and the experience became the cherry on top of our San Francisco sundae.< /review>

Went there with the  whole family yesterday for my birthday. Excellent clam chowder and calamari fritte. I got violently sick on my way home. I was the only one to have the Canadian lobster tails and the only one with excruciating stomach pains and severe diarrhea within thirty minutes of leaving the restaurant with a 2.5 hr ride home due to heavy traffic in the city. Never been sick after a meal in my life. I can tolerate just about anything. I put the blame on the lobster tails as we all had the same clam chowder and appetizer.  I was the only one eating the lobster main course. Thankfully the doctor encouraged me to use miralax to  get rid of the tainted food. I was fine today after a tough night.most memorable birthday  of my life.<//Text>

Top notch service beginning with hostess and host...so friendly and professional- sorry to the two of you but the service was so spot on that we didn't have time to get your names!  Tim, our waiter was on the spot at all times.  As soon as we thought about it, he was there with questions or suggestions.  Food was a 5 on scale of 5 but to us, it was all about the service from the live communications via text regarding our reservations to the warm welcome and prompt seating to Tim's superb attention without interruption and Jin Lin's water and setting service.  Final point, this was my second time visiting Scoma's...first was 20 years ago and the service and food have not wavered.   Maybe others in San Francisco that have higher ratings but for the atmosphere, service and taste, it's our favorite.< /text>

This is an old school vibe seafood place with excellent food. We had the several appetizers, the clams, crab cakes, and scallops. It was the beginning of crab season so we ordered a few roasted crabs as well. Everything was very fresh and I'd recommend visiting.

Tip: there's free valet parking if you drive all the way up to the restaurant.< /review>

<Review>This place has a real old school vibe that I really enjoy.  It's off the beaten path in fisherman's wharf, litterally you take an alleyway to get there.  The food is decent, and it's pricing is what you would expect for the area.  Service is usually good to great. I reccomend the  Sol Dore.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>We visited based on a suggestion from family, and i am so glad we did, since we might not have looked for it or visited since it doesn't stick out very well. The ambience inside is fun and cozy, we waited about 35 minutes to be sat but we hung out at the bar.  Great wine selection bar staff was very friendly. We had a pasta dish and fried shrimp and scallops. Everything was perfect. The pasta sauce was creamy and flavorful and the fried items were crispy but not soaked in oil. The service was fantastic.

This was our first trip to San Francisco. Our tour bus driver recommended Scoma. So we went. The location and atmosphere are great! We waited an hour to be seated.
The food is fair, small portions of fish which were over cooked. My husband said his fried seafood dish was not good. But in all fairness, we are from the northeast where the seafood is probably the best!
We've been to many $$ restaurants that were better than this $$$.< /Text>

This place is a classic... It hasn't changed much in the past 20 years and I bet it hasn't changed much since it opened... It's that good.  Make a reservation and take advantage of the valet parking. It's a place for seafood but this landlubber has always been satisfied with my meals here.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>An elegant, yet with a pleasantly low-key atmosphere. A star choice if you are looking for good quality fresh sea-food with a twist. Charmingly located by San Francisco quay. Beyond the main dishes displayed a good selection of wines and nice deserts. A bit pricey but totally worth it.<//review>< Pics>

Service was friendly and warm. Food did not disappoint. I had the ribeye, ordered medium and it madame medium well, just as the owner said I should order- I'll order better next time! My friends had cioppino and loved it (split between two grown men and it was enough to share and then some!) And the salmon special was scrumptious! Definitely come here, ready for a memorable meal and a relaxed time.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Wonderful food and service. The fried calamari are a great appetizer and the seared halibut is a wonderful choice. Highly recommend a visit. Some people say it's pricey, but I can't agree with this statement when I compare the price of food at other restaurants in the area. At least here you get what you pay for, and there are many years of service and reputation to rely on. Just a pleasure overall. Will return whenever I'm in town.<//text>< Pictures>

My wife and I came in this evening on a whim, we left with a smile. The whole walk back we talked of the rarity of a place like this these days. Steve the server at the bar where we sat had wonderful storys of days gone by in his 25 years of service with the resturant. From famous guests to nightlife of the 90's!  The food was fantastic but it was the atmosphere and staff that after just one visit has my wife and I calling it "our" spot.<//Text>

I used to come here with my Dad when I was young. This was our go to spot. The food is still good, but the menu shrunk. You can still get items from the old menu if you ask for it, but you have to know the old menu. Service is very good and the views are very nice. Took my family here for the first time and had a very nice evening<//Text>

Terrific from the time we arrived to the time we left.  The food was first class. Everyone in our party of four had a different meal and everyone really enjoyed it. Our waiter was gracious and entertaining. Sweet desserts were delicious and reasonably priced. The same menu is used for both lunch and dinner. We were there for lunch, and as a lunch item the entrees seemed a bit pricey. Each of the sea food items in my cioppino refresh season perfectly and tasted wonderful with the perfectly made broth.<//Text>

<Review>My family and I usually ride BART to SF and walk around pier 39. Whenever, we do, we always eat at Scoma's. The food is so delicious here. I love that I can get my favorite seafood or shellfish and my husband can get his steak or chicken. Whatever you order at Scoma's will be fresh and very delicious. You will love the wait staff as I do. They are knowledgeable about all dishes, wine, drinks, and desserts.<//Review>< Response>

I had high expectations on this place and they were largely met. We had the crab chowder to start which was pretty darn good. We followed up with the mixed fish grill. The fish was really good, very nicely grilled but the rice pasta could have used more flavour. The bbq sauce with the meal was a knockout. Service was unobtrusive and the meals came out quick.<//review>

<review>It was a nice atmosphere, and good service. Food was tasty, but price was high. Yes it's at fisherman's warf, and yes it was good quality, but still a high price for the food. Would eat there again, but probably wouldn't seek it out. Drinks were quite expensive, would avoid for just drinks. (~20$ per drink at a restaurant is a lot to me personally).< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Delicious seafood and very big portion. One half of the restaurant is nicely decorated with new furniture and the other looks like it hasn't been touched for 70 years. All was good except one of the waiter would 'shush' the room once in a while as if he wants us to quiet down - super awkward for a restaurant to do that.<//Text>

Fantastic! Food was super fresh and simply sublime. Added bonus was the free valet parking. You definitely need reservations or be prepared to wait but it's a wait well worth it. This is THE place to go.< /Text>

I visited in June of 2014. It took me a bit to get past the dated decor...

It was a little hard for a first timer to San Francisco to find, but turned out to be a hidden gem.

The food was absolutely out of this world. Dishes were spot on. Some of the best and freshest seafood I have tasted anywhere. Pasta was cooked perfectly (not over done like most places will serve).  Sauces tasted fresh.

This was the first restaurant I visited on my first visit to San Francisco, and it set the bar high for my expectations of the quality of seafood for the area. Some restaurants came close but none matched.

I would highly recommend this restaurant!</Text>

Service is typical American which is fine. I'm guessing our guy has been working there since the dawn of time, he was old but effortless in his work.

Tip: avoid the mass produced beers and try the local stuff on tap. They're good!<//Review>< Pics>

<text>I was taken to this restaurant for my anniversary.  Believe me when I say I tried to get out of it.  I didn't want to sit in a restaurant that smelled of fish or had creatures swimming awaiting their doom.  So I balked all the way to San Francisco.  When we arrived I thought it's a "Hole in the Wall" from the area we had driven into.  Then a valet came to park the car which I found odd because the restaurant appeared very small from the outside.
Boy, was I fooled.

Inside, you have a reservation counter and a cozy waiting place upstairs with vintage pictures on the wall.  There may be a 30 - 45 minute wait but you are not uncomfortable.  Drinks may be ordered from the waiting area and it's not drafty.  Upon going to the dining room, the doors were slid back and what a view!  Elegant dining room with a back wall view of the bay.  Service was on point and at the time Walter was my server.  He was the most charming man ever.  I had the Lobster Provolone Dinner and it was hands-down 5 star!  We had a Lovely evening.

Two weeks later in-laws from Germany arrived and after hearing about Scoma's took us out to this restaurant.  We all had a delightful time and this is now my favorite restaurant.  The crab salad is a must!  One salad fed 4 adults and we were almost too full for the meal.  Excellent!  10 Star!!</text><Date>1520787517942</Date>< resp>

<review>This is my favorite place to dine in San Francisco. We always get the Cioppino, which only gets better each time we eat here. It is off the beaten path a little , built on it's own little Wharf shared with working fishing vessels so all the sights, sounds and smells are there. (A disclaimer...smells like the sea, not dead fish....inside it smells like wonderful cooking 😀). The wait staff is extrodinary. They have all been there for, I kid you not, for decades. I feel this place has not changed much since it opened....they know what is good and they keep doing great food.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>This little gem of a seafood restaurant is hidden at the end of the pier. Valet parking at the end for customers.  Driving over a small bridge and around a blind corner, lol.  Well worth the search!  We ordered the   crab bisque 🦀 and lobster thermador which was more than enough for two. We did not want to wait for a table so we ate at the bar.  The bar area is a bit crowded, but again, the food is worth it. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1557788030362, 'text': "We're happy you found us, Lorraine and very pleased to know you enjoyed your meal at the bar.

We had drinks in the upper bar, where the ambience is perfect. The mixologists are super, interacting and explaining things to patrons. The cucumber in my G&T was a work of art, they obviously take their craft seriously. Jean-Marc served us with infectious enthusiasm.

I cannot think of a better way to while away a couple of hours before dinner.<//review>

Great food in a bit of a hidden away location. Ate for lunch as a party of 8, no pre-booking.

Very friendly and helpful staff, food was very good and portions huge (for a Brit)!  Maybe consider sharing.

Pricing wise you will find much cheaper restaurants just round the corner, but I can't imagine they are of the same calibre.</review>

Excellent. As an occasional UK visitor Scoma's is the first place on the Wharf I would eat. Food was superb and the portions large. I was pleased two of us shared the calamari starter otherwise I would have have been full before the seafood saute arrived. This was outstanding, cooked to perfection. Quality wine was reasonably priced for a restaurant. Service was with a smile and provided just the right of information.< /review>

Scoma’s restaurant is a must do for any foodie traveling through San Fransisco. Located in Fisherman’s Wharf this homy restaurant is within a hub of sight seeing to do’s. The food is tasty and fresh and they have a full bar that offers craft cocktails. The ambiance is comfortable and somewhat upscale without being pretentious. Waitstaff is experienced and gracious. There is also a valet option as parking can be a challenge on the wharf. Come down and give this local favorite a try.</review>

<text>I would give it six stars if I could.  Atmosphere was great, service was fantastic and the food was excellent.   I had the swordfish piccatta and would say it is firmly in my top 10 favorite meals ever.  John was our server and I don't remember having better service anywhere.

<user>101597703621653160380< /user><review>Top notch!  We make plans to dine at Scomas every time we are in San Francisco. We are never disappointed in the meals and service. This time around my husband had the Chopino and he loved it. I had the Fish & Chips lunch special which was great portions of tender fish in crispy beer batter. Soo Good! Their clam chowder is very delicious also, we shared a cup just because we have to have chowder with sour dough when we come to the wharf & this one hits the mark. I suggest you walk past all those noisy eateries along the main street to this legendary restaurant, follow the signs to Scomas.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Classic white tablecloth Californian seafood restaurant, with professional table service, fresh fish and a good enough bar. The plancha seared calamari were really good and I also had the crab Thermidor and shared crab plate and both were fine. People here are a mixture of tourists and adult old time Californians and the menu is the traditional old time french inspired seafood cuisine. It's a five stars if you are really into that, otherwise it's a little bit expensive for what they offer.</text>< Pictures>

Sometimes you have a great experience at a restaurant but occasionally you have an unforgettable experience. My father and I had one of those unforgettable experiences at our last visit to Scoma's. Kevin, our waiter and Matthew the manager were simply incredible to us and couldn't have been more gracious, kind and generous.

PS: get the Cioppino...you won't be disappointed.</Review>< pictures>

Please know that food sickness can take anywhere from several hours to several days for the symptoms to manifest themselves.

Please reach out to us if you can with more details about your order and the timing of your symptoms. Food safety is always our number one priority at Scoma's and we always want to know as much as possible about any possible issue. Thank you and we hope you were feeling better soon."}< /response>
<review>Brought my wife, her mother and father, and my son and his wife down to spend two days in San Francisco before we headed down to Carmel. We are all big seafood eaters and picked out Scoma's because of it's high rating. We all had mussels except for one person in our group, and all but the one became violently ill that night. Easily the worst food sickness we have ever had. Please be avised, I would never order mussels or shellfish again from.this restaurant. Although we at this point would never go back to Scoma's.< /review>< Time>

I can't believe I had never been.  CC the bartender was super friendly, made great drinks and pointed us in the right direction for food.  I'll definitely be back and make sure I recommend it to everyone headed to that section of town.</Review>

I've never eaten at fisherman's wharf but on my last trip I couldn't avoid it. Scoma's was probably there before fisherman's wharf turned into the tourist trap it is today. The age is reflected in the interior, which makes for a rather charming/cozy atmosphere. The waiters were friendly and helpful. Food is rather pricey but OK.< /review>

Nothing was particularly wrong, but nothing was spectacular either. We tried Scoma's based on several recommendations by friends. Our waitress was great, very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We order drinks to start while deciding what to eat, the drinks were delivered quickly, they're fine...a little light on the alcohol based on how much they're charging and not made as well as other places. We order an appetizer to split and order our entrees at the same time. Our appetizer never comes... It ends up being delivered with our entrees. Not what we wanted with an appetizer but ok. I order the cioppino, and it was tasty. He orders the steak (doesn't like seafood), and it's just ok... The steak was cooked well enough but not great, the parmesan polenta was not very good (I've made better at home) and the mushrooms were just ok (he didn't like the texture of how they were cooked). We decide on dessert, our waitress expounds on how great their pastry chef is.... It's a lie, the desserts were no better than grocery store bought desserts. Overall a disappointment based on recommendations and reviews, and their own reporting.</text>

Food was okay okay at best. I had the mixed grill and it was small with a lot of filler vegetables.  The fish itself was tasty but very small pieces. For the price of 190 for two of us I wouldn't recommend  it. Go somewhere else.</review><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmapID>< response>

My wife and I LOVE this place. This is the focal point of any visit to San Francisco. If you enjoy fresh off the boat seafood, in a very well done 1960s Italian bar and restaurant atmosphere, then this place should be at the top of your list. Make reservations.< /Review>

I've been going to Scomas since I was 6 years old. Now I'm 58 years old.  I always have had a great time and great food.  Not this day last Saturday.  We were seated in lousy seats, we wanted hot coffee and got warm coffee we asked for it to be microwaved and the waiter said no we then asked him to take the coffee away then he came back with hot coffee.  Our order was taken very poorly attitude waiter, we ordered ciopino and we had this dish over the past 20 years and it tasted like tomatoe soup. The waiter asked how the meal was and we asked if the cook was new and we were told he'd been there a couple years. The waiter asked why are we asking and we explained the ciopino was just tomato soup with sea food.  Waiter said he would let the chef know. We are ok with that. Our meal was 160.00 we left a 40.00 tip. The waiter came outside and siad  thank you and we were happy about that. During our meal we heard a loud french accent waiter yelling at a dark beared waiter making comments to him that he would kill him, and tear him apart basic threats and that was disappointing.  So i am sad to say Scomas has lost its pasaz and quality and ambiance after my 50 years of going there. I felt i was treated lack luster because of my attire but rest assured we are well off. Oh one last thing as we were leaving a guy with a jaguars had lost his keys from the valet so sad we like the valet. So something is wrong at Scomas!</text>

We are sorry to hear you did not enjoy where you were seated. Please accept our apologies and know if that ever occurs again we are always happy to move you to where you'd prefer. As for the cioppino, it is our classic recipe that we've had for most of our existence and we normally get excellent feedback on it. We are not sure what could have been different on your visit but we will see. Finally, we apologize if there was some commotion between the staff members. That should never interrupt a diner's experience and we will certainly address it so it never happens again. If possible please come in and introduce yourself some day so we can apologize in person, make sure we can put a face with the name and have you make sure the cioppino is as good as you always recalled.

<review>One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Retains the old SF vibe while having classic dishes that will please just about anyone. Even people who are not seafood fans should be able to find something great.< /review>< UserId.>

<Text>Menu in the $20-$40 meal range. The clam chowder soup and clam chowder bisque are both delicious at about $12. The bisque is extremely crabby and smooth while the chowder is a bit more mellow and chunky.<//Text>< Rating>

We had a pleasant evening and the place has old school charm but the food wasn’t amazing which was slightly disappointing given the price. If you are spending over $200 for your meal you really want to walk out saying “that was fabulous”....we didn’t</review>

<rating>3</rating><Review>Just about fair if you are from Europe and are used to eat fresh seafood grilled. Don't expect that, as everything will come with some sort of sauce that will hide seafood natural taste. If you're used to eat seafood with sauce, go for it. Locals seemed to like it a lot.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was disappointed in the food.  The waiter was friendly and great.  It was good for children,  but the food was old fashioned and just not up to what i had hoped with such a high rating.   I know many people are happy with the food, but you have to know who is rating it.  I'm a bit of a foodie.< /Review>

Great dinner spot.   Off the beaten path but worth going out of your way.  Parking is tight so walk or uber.  Staff was excellent and very attentive.  Drinks and food were both excellent.  Old school "rat pack" feel, lounge areas and dinner seating allow for a couples or friends night out.  Portions were good size and reasonably priced.  Highly recommend the mixed seafood grill and butternut squash soup.< /Review>

Perfect place for seafood right off the boat. Atmosphere is great and makes you feel like Frank Sinatra could be eating in the next room. Service is incredible, with the waiter attending to every possible need. One of the best draft beer selections I've seen yet!< /text>

Truly a five star establishment! This place is old school - fantastic service, extremely fresh, and very much classic San Francisco. I would highly recommend the Pisco Punch if you like warm spices, the calamari is incredible, awesome crab cakes, and all of the entrees our party had were great. We had a layer cake dessert too that was excellent! Allow for plenty of time to enjoy a well-paced multi course meal here.<//text>

<review>We have a tradition of eating lunch at Scoma's when we fly in to San Fran from the east coast.  It's our first stop.  It's always been great but this past Friday night (dinner for the first time), it was a major disappointment.  Not one of the five of us enjoyed our meal.  Dry, tasteless fish and blah-broth, lazy man's cioppino. Small portions of bland, dry fish for $40.00!  I don't think so.

The staff is great and the atmosphere is cozy and fun.  Major help needed in the kitchen.  There are too many places to eat in San Fran that are excellent and unfortunately, there is little excitement or interest in eating at Scoma's again.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>This place is incredible .
I don't really like seafood but I loved every single thing I ate (& I even ate a tentacle!). My other half loved seafood and loved it too.The food is fantastic and there is a lovely atmosphere.
There's a classy 60s feel inside (the waiters are in white jackets and  and just so lovely and knowledgeable). Scoma have their own boat and you can literally watch the fish come off the boat, into their processing plant and into the restaurant. You can't get fresher.
Don't let the lack of outdoor seating put you off. We arrived at sunset on a lovely night & wanted to sit outside ...... But actually a seat in the lounge by the window was incredible. We watched a lovely sunset and kept warm.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My sister and I has a late dinner here tonight. We added ourselves to the handy yelp waitlist at 8:00pm and were 17th in line.  We were instructed to be at the restaurant at 8:30pm.

We arrived late because or lyft driver was very slow but they still honored our waitlist spot.  We had a very professional and attentive waiter but not extremely personable.  I ordered the 3 fish grill (cod, salmon and halibut) and a cup of clam chowder. I loved the halibut and the salmon was above average the cold tasted a teeny bit underdone but that may have been the texture since it is a flaky fish.  She ordered calamari app, ceasar salad and a cup of clam chowder. She enjoyed everything as well but we both agreed the clam chowder was the belle of the ball.

It was a pricey meal at nearly a hundred dollars for our meals but it was a prime location and beautiful post sunset view.

While I wouldn't insist on a revisit, I have no regrets.  It was a lovely meal and a great experience.< /Text>

<Review>Amazing dinner!  Service was excellent. Our server, Sal, made us feel so special. My daughter wanted a pasta dish with crab, but the menu did not offer one. Sal said they could make it for her. He recommended the white wine, mushroom and garlic sauce and the dish was perfect!  The cracked chilled crab was juicy and sweet!
I will recommend SCOMA'S to all my friends that plan to visit SAN FRANCISCO!< /Review><time>1511070002870</time>< username>

Stellar meal. Attentive service. Great old school cocktails (boozy, plentiful, cold) - very fresh seafood, excellent presentation, well put together traditional menu ( oysters Rockefeller? Hell yes!) - Dungeness crab pot overflowing with fresh meat ; oyster platter was exquisite. Desserts a must.< /Text>

Terrific food.  Very good service.  It has an old time feel of a classier establishment.  Way nicer than the rest of the tourist trap and chain places.  Go at off times to avoid a wait.<//Text>

Amazing food, hidden gem. Excellent waitstaff recommendations, patient with many questions and very attentive to food allergies.

Highly recommend!

Based on location and lack of signs pointing you there, very much seemed like a “locals secret”!<//text>

Had a great time here, sat by the bar and enjoyed the very friendly service and great food. Fresh seafood with a nice range of options. Book ahead if you want a table for 3 or more but I recommend trying the bar seating if you get the chance<//Review>

We love Scoma's. It's great old school service and awesome food. There were at least 20 people milling around inside and out hoping to get a table, and it looked sketchy for our reservation, but we were seated at our table immediately. Yes, they knew how to both take and keep a reservation. We'll be back.</Review>

A hidden gem! For a primarily seafood place, the pasta here was one of the best I've had(and I eat a lot Italian food). The service was exceptionally great . Our waiter (so sad I forgot his name) kept us entertained as well as satisfied our every need. Thank you Scoma's for your hospitality and great food.<//Text>

My open faced albacore was delish even though it could have been a bit hotter. The green salad that came with it was tasty and I liked the kind off greens they used not your average ice Berg. It came with French fries with the skin. We were there for lunch so they offered lunch specials which I really at appreciated. They weren't skimpy in their servings either. Although the I've tea was a bit expensive $3 and it came in a small glass. It's the cheapest easiest drink to make. I was a bit irritated but then I remembered we had about 4 baskets of their yummy sourdough bread so I calmed down 😁  overall it was a nice dining experience for me. The service was great.</text>

Our favorite seafood place in  a city with hundreds of excellent restaurants. Have been going there for years.  Always great food and prompt service.  Much better than the other more visible Wharf area restaurants.<//Review>

<text>Recommended by a cab driver, said they had the best clam chowder in San Francisco.... clam chowder is alright. Food is over priced. Our waiter was a chubby guy sounded just like Louie Anderson. Was very nice and friendly to everyone else, but when it came to be and my husband he never made conversation. Never going there again.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

The website claims the restaurant is „vegetarian friendly“. Since we couldn’t find anything vegetarian on their menu, we called to ask. They told us they can make a salad and pasta. When we asked if that was it (considering they claim to be so friendly towards vegetarians), they hung up on us. Great customer service!</Text>

<Review>A hidden gem! For a primarily seafood place, the pasta here was one of the best I've had(and I eat a lot Italian food). The service was exceptionally great . Our waiter (so sad I forgot his name) kept us entertained as well as satisfied our every need. Thank you Scoma's for your hospitality and great food.< /Review><time>1503630299863<//time>< UserId.>

Waited 15 minutes on a Saturday evening. My wife's crab was a huge portion and I had sole. The crab cakes were awesome! The server was very knowledgeable and patient with us.<//Review>

<Review>Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.
After being repeatedly and shamelessly lied to about the availability of our table, it was impossible to enjoy anything these lying pieces of crud could serve. "Immediately" and "we're preparing your table right now"  mean at least a 30 minute wait at this nightmare of mismanagement and lies in my experience tonight.
Don't wait for a table here, don't eat here. These diots don't deserve a penny on your money.</Review><user>118390769405010704739</user>< Rate>

Romantic location in exclusive Sausalito with views of San Francisco and Tiburon. Seafood is fresh and oysters on the half shell get comfortable on a bed of ice. Dining here is intimate and conversations inspire grins and sharing of secret tales in three to four languages. Excellent location, cuisine and sometimes even the company.<//Review>

After a long day of touristy stuff with two kids we happened in on this local's recommended restaurant.  We were tired and it was about a 45 min wait, but we sat at the bar and the nicest bartender made us feel right at home.  Seafood and kids meals were excellent.  Garlic crab and seafood salad were top notch and my daughter especially liked the prawns.  I would highly recommend this for anyone in or around the area.</text>

One of the best seafood restaurants in the city. Free valet parking. There is usually a wait on the weekends so a reservation is helpful. Try the shellfish saute. It's not on the menu but it's incredible!< /Review>

We love Scoma's. It's great old school service and awesome food. There were at least 20 people milling around inside and out hoping to get a table, and it looked sketchy for our reservation, but we were seated at our table immediately. Yes, they knew how to both take and keep a reservation. We'll be back.<//Review>

I've been coming to Scoma's since around 1984 and I've always loved it.  The view, the vibe, the food.  The clam chowder is great, it's the first place I ever had fried calamari (with marinara, pls) but the cioppino is my absolute favorite.  I couldn't visit SF without visiting Scoma's.</review>

It's been years since we have gone to Scoma's. They had the best Ciopino I had ever had, so really looking forward to the meal. I didn't mind the 90 minute wait, because of the tremendous food. The sauce used to be garlicky and flavorful. This one tasted like fish and shellfish boiled in tomato soup, so pretty bland. Our whole group thought the food pretty average.< /review>

Had calimari, fried scallops with bacon and crabcakes. Main meal was halibut and it just melted in your mouth. Wonderful flavors.Service was stellar. Even after we asked for our 4th helping of sourdough bread.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</gmap_id>< user>

<Review>There were 2 sides to our experience.  First we went at 2:30pm and it was very busy, unfortunately they couldn't handle it.  We had a very efficient guy filling up our drinks and bringing us bread but that wasn't the waiter, the waiter took a long, long time to take our orders, even though we had told the drink-server guy we were ready ages before.  He also made an excuse rather than just apologizing.  Then my wife was brought her chowder way before my scampi starter, this is just amateur.  Then our mains were brought before our starters had been taken away, not such a bad thing but it's a clear indication of a badly run floor and pass.  The food was tasty but also expensive.  The table next to us had complained that one of their dishes tasted very strange although the chef did come over and apologize.  Overall it was great food with very badly organized service.  Don't go when it's busy and you'll probably have a good time.</Review>< Pictures>

A beautiful menu full of beautiful fresh fish, all sadly massacred by the over cooking of said fish. The dishes are also unfortunately accompanied by strange concoctions which insult the poor fish further then to add further insult to injury, it's extremely expensive.  The oysters are delightful and fresh, give these a try< /Text>

<Review>Hidden behind Fisherman's Wharf with a view of the water this place is worth the few extra steps and sometimes short wait.  Once you are seated you are greeted by the most friendly staff and walked through the delicious daily specials(many of them right off the boat).  They have a nice wine menu and you are given a nice basket of bread to munch on while your food is being prepared.

A little bit pricey, but well worth it compared to the other tourists traps around the Wharf this place is worth the money.  The Cioppino is to die for and comes in a huge portion, The fresh swordfish is also a favorite menu item.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
The best possible seafood in San Francisco. Scomas is a landmark in Fisherman's wharf. They have the freshest seafood, right off the boat. Beautiful views day or night. The bay is lapping right up to the parking lot - and yes, they have free parking, just remember to tip the hard working valets. They can have long waits to be seated, you're welcome to call ahead and ask what the wait time is. The long waits to be seated are because they are the best seafood restaurant ever. People come from all over the world to eat at Scoma's.
Try it.  You won't be disappointed.< /Review>

Although the clam chowder wasn't terrible, it isn't worth the hype and was very starchy. Maybe living in Rhode Island I've become a snob. I was really disappointed in the Dungeness crab cakes. Shredded meat and lots of filler, when I had been expecting some decent limp crab cake. Service was terrible. Very slow. 10 minutes before being offered even water. I opted not to stay for a main course.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//gmap_id></record>

I didn’t realize how expensive most dishes would be, but the lunch specials were better and very tasty. I had a steak sandwich that was well prepared and filling. The fixed price lunch menus also looked like a good way to taste multiple dishes!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Your going to have a hard time finding fresher seafood than this place, if you were paying attention you walked by the fishing boats on your way to the restaurant. Excellent crab cakes, clam chowder and the scallops are my personal favorites.</Review>

Lovely place to eat! My wife and I were in San Francisco above the Fisherman's Wharf area from July 1 - 5, 2002, shortly after our marriage, and a nearby shopkeeper (would that I could remember his name or of his store!) recommended Scoma's as a great place to eat. He was right. Fantastic food and service. My one disappointment was trying Dungeness Crab but aside from that, nothing whatsoever to complain about. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the fine food and drink Scoma's has to offer. P.S. You do have Alaskan King Crab legs don't you?  ;)<//Text>

<name>NY CEE</name><date>1552935143456< /date><pics>None<//pics><Review>Disappointed from the high ratings it received. Ordered the trio sampler first.  The calamari was mostly tenttactes and not fried adequately.  The scallops and crab cakes on it were decent.

My seafood in marinera sauce was decent but the bartender recommend a crab cream cheese casserole dish which was subpar.

Overall the food here is decent but definitely not superb like the ratings would lead you to believe.  The Fog House was much better with nice ambiance and actually cheaper!< /Review>< UserId.>

Our Calamari is one of our most popular dishes exactly for the reason you listed--it is lightly fried, mostly tentacles and not the simple rings most places serve.

You know it's good when you go mmmmm on every bite. Then at the end you start cutting it into smaller bites to make it last longer. I had the steelhead trout and that's what I did. This place is really that good.</Text>

<Text>The food and service are not as great as their location across the bay (Sausalito), but I enjoyed all of the dishes I ordered nonetheless.

If you're expecting the same experience as the Sausalito location, you will be a bit disappointed.  However, if you're craving any of their signature dishes and don't feel like crossing the bay, then it's conveniently located adjacent to Fisherman's Wharf.<//Text></record>

Seem like you get transfered back in time as the waiters have very traditional uniforms and it seems nothing got changed on the interior since 60 years. Better reserve a table as otherwise you need to wait. The food is delicious but pricy which is probably related to the proximity to Fisherman's Wharf. Definitely worth a visit as also there is a wide variety of dishes and not everything is seafood. A cool place...<//review>

Long wait,  slow service,  expect 2.5 hours total.  Food is good but not amazing.  Lobster and steak are flavorless.  So are the veggies.  Its by the water so pretty nice view,  but not all its hyped to be.  Wouldn't come again.<//Text>

I can't put my finger on it because the food was delicious ..and yes it was pricy...service was good as well.. possibly it was eating dinner watching the multitude of homeless dig though the dock trash for food right outside the window. No reflection on this establishment or it's team...state of our society<//Text>

Excellent seafood place right on Fisherman's wharf.  Good service, beer, and better food. Not much of a view outside of the docks off of the building due to other larger structures.<//Text>

If you don’t want to servers us just ask someone else to do so.
I can definitely seen the difference between you sever other table and us,seen you sick smile. The $6 dollars only for cleaning fee, not for your service.
Anyway the food was just okey, don’t worthy. Don’t wasted your time and money. Nothing special!< /Text>< pictures>

We went only one night to Scoma's but it's worth every cent. The seafood was excellent. Also the service and the furnishings and equipment are very good. We really loved the location as the restaurant is located on an old pier.</text>

<text>This was a fantastic place to get some really good seafood. I had half a Dungeoness Crab chilled and the "Lazy Man's" Cioppino all topped off with a very nice glass of wine. Was a bit on the expensive side, but if you have the cash to spend you will have a great meal with a great view in a very nice restaurant.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>5<//rate>< user_name>

<text>Overpriced, terrible service and awful food.  For these prices we should have had a leisurely dinner but that was not the case.  We had cocktails, appetizers & meal & we're done in less than 40 minutes.  We ordered the clams & they were just plan weird (definitely not the right texture).  The beet salad was good but the presentation was really unappetizing.  The fish entrees we had were "ok" but at $34 for 6oz. of salmon, it should have been a lot better.  Basically I will never recommend this place - NEVER!</text><name>judy bourne</name>< rate>

Scoma's has been the best sea food restaurant in the bay for such a long time. They just make higher quality seafood than anything else I've found.<//Review>

< Review>
Oh my! What a find!   We were near Fisherman's Warf looking for a good bite to eat and Yelp suggested this place.   When we walked in I was a little worried that we were underdressed because the wait staff was bow ties and sharp as could be.  But I figured, "meh, my money's green."
Our waiter was very kind and kept our kids supplied with a delicious crusty bread. We barely scratched the menu but the fish and chips and clam chowder were absolutely excellent.  I for one am pretty hard to please with those two items and Scoma's nailed them.
Overall our lunch in SanFran was one of the best experiences of the trip.< /Review>

This is definitely one of those places that you have to go to in San Francisco. I have been told to go here by so many people and after sitting down and trying it I completely understand why so many people are in love with this place. As a tourist is one of those places you just have to try at least once.< /Text>

<review>First time that I have been to this restaurant. If you enjoy and appreciate New York style type of waiters, then this is the place for you. The meal that I ordered was a house speciality and it excited the pallet. I have learned to eat slowly and enjoy the flavors and presentation. The individual that was in charged of filling the water glass was excellent and attentive. I tried the chowder house speciality found that it was a smaller portion, as compared to Fog Harbor. I would definitely return to try other items.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /GmapID></record>

<text>Amazing seafood, even better people that work here what more could you ask for? Oh maybe some old celebrity photos on the wall? Yeah this place has that too. If you are eating here and have room get the Clam Chowder, Cioppino, or the Grilled Salmon with Lobster Ravioli. Every time I have eaten here it was great and I am going to be making another reservation to come here in the next week or two.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//Gmap_id></record>

Fresh seafood. Many options. No reservations required.  Visited again tonight 6/12/17. They have removed several items from their menu. For a one or two time visit they are good.  After that it is repetitive.<//Text>

It blew me away. Really good classic dishes, with authentic flavor. The crab cakes had just enough crab and the sauce was not tooo rich. Get the fried artichoke hearts, they were light but still crispy!

This is great for a date, anyone who wants to get a waterfront view, and a cozy place.< /Text>< Pics>

This is a nice restaurant if you want something a little more upscale. Most of the surrounding restaurants are touristy, but Scomas has charm and excellent food. Great fresh seafood!<//Text>

The service was very slow, the waitress only took half our drink orders before leaving the table, the fish didn't seem fresh, and all our entrees were very oily and almost identical, even when they looked different on the menu. Their lobster bisque was quite nice though.< /text>

Service was fine, but not equipped to solve the food questions.

I had the Classic Crab Louie Salad (~$40). The crab was tasteless. I ate about 1/3 and gave up. Server assured me it was not frozen, but the lack of taste suggested to me it probably canned. Server suggested they may have 'washed' the crab reducing the flavor?

My friend had the Poor Man's Cioppino (~$40), which was an apt description. Lots of seafood in a thick sauce that could have been V8 juice. The brussel sprouts($9) were very good, you can't really go wrong when you add bacon to anything. Tasty bread and butter. Definitely a tourist trap, would not recommend.

Total bill a bottle of sparkling water ~$107, no alcohol. Yes, we could have sent it all back and walked out, some days you just don't have the energy for that.

Tonight we have reservations at 'Dirty Habit' and much higher expectations.< /text>

I live in the Bay Area but only recently visited Scoma's for the first time.  Unfortunately, it didn't exactly meet my expectations.  The food was ok but was pretty bland, and the menu seemed severely lacking in creativity.  The fact that they give you free parking is great, but I found the prices pretty high for the quality of the meal.  Perhaps worth trying once, but I'm not sure I'll go back.</text>

Service is, of course, excellent for this type of restaurant.  The seafood although cooked very well, is over-priced and underwhelming. I found myself thinking about the seafood stands I saw on the wharf and craving bigger bites.<//Text>

Worst seafood I've ever had! Anyone that appreciates and respects the protein should avoid this place. Their Cioppino being their signature dish deserved the name Lazy! It could have been a tinned chunky tomato soup. So very disappointing!
Dated... overpriced... poorly cooked... presentation was terrible... I have left feeling hungry and robbed!<//review>

One of just a few places along the wharf we enjoy. Their mussels are our favs though they were not so good last time we visited. The wait for a table is usually very long so call ahead.<//text>

< Review>
Love this place! Very fresh seafood, very tasty. Love the mafioso appeal. The walls filled with countless autographed celebrity photos offer amusing eye appetizers while awaiting our entrees. Best clam chowder I've ever had in The City. It's a little hidden but in a good way, likely keeping out wandering tourists or weekend hippies from chancing upon it, making it next to impossible to get a window table on a walk-in. Of all of the many eateries around San Francisco's great Wharf, Scoma's is the the only one I personally consider worthy of historical significance. Yes, Boudins began here and may still be the more popular restaurant even today, however in my opinion Boudins has grown into the Budweiser of bread. Scoma's has something no other Embarcadero restaurant has, a pulse, an identity, character, and bay city charm.  Stepping into Scoma's feels like stepping out of the city. A peaceful, quiet, sense will greet you as you enter as if time itself slows. Forwarding through time, neighboring eateries will likely fade away while Scoma's remains, gaining fame, iconic status, and historical importance. What Randy's Donuts is to LA, or what Katz Delicatessen is to Manhattan, so should Scoma's be to SF. From the cresting waves of the mighty Pacific Ocean, along California's golden coastline, a small port town filling with migrant ruffians and Forty-Niners quickly grew outward and upward. It grew across steep terrain, eventually gaining root spanning the entire Southern Peninsula. Where Giant Pacific Redwood forests once grew, now grows a mighty metropolis. A civilization so grand that Westerners know simply as, "The City," and it was here, hidden down a narrow alleyway, treaded upon by those who've come to know of it. There, built directly onto the wooden planks of a dock, nearest the point where city becomes sea, that is where you'll find it...  Scoma's. To all you soon to be first timers, you're welcome.</Review>

<Text>It's a seafood restaurant so don't go there for the pasta. The alfredo wasn't very interesting and I don't eat seafood so there wasn't much else to try. The chocolate brownie with ice cream was delicious though. It's a big place with a lot of seats but they still had a waiting list on the weekend.< /Text>< Pictures>

<user>104607424381319946855</user>< Review>
Started with a perfect Bloody Mary while waiting 45 minutes for a table.  Never has a wait been so worth it!

We had a bowl of clam chowder.  Fresh clams and organic ingredients. It was far and away the best I have had!

The entre was Pasta Diplomatica which is sort of an Alfredo white sauce.  Fresh ground pepper and fresh grated cheese added to the mix. It was a huge portion of one of the best entre's I have ever had!  Simply delicious!

The wait staff, of which there are plenty, are always there before you need them.  Always filling glasses or taking care of things, but never intruding into the meal.

It was the best meal I have had in a very long time!  Only shame was we had no room for desert.  And the desert menu was sooo tempting.

I will never come to San Francisco and miss Scoma's restaurant!< /Review>

Off of Fisherman's Wharf main path so not as frequented as other touristy restaurants. Reasonable prices for San Fran at the Wharf.< /review>

I have loved this place since my father took me there as a child and young adult. I was killing time and thinking of calamari as I saw the Scoma sign. It was so tender and the spinach salad was awesome. I had enough left over to share with a friend.</Review>

We came to Scomas for lunch because of the great reviews and the free valet parking. Walked in right when they opened at 1130am and got a seat right by the window as requested. Excellent service by older gentlemen that took care of us, had the Cod on the lunch prefix menu along with four shellfish combo which was delicious , I will be back.</Text>

He helped me choose softer foods (a week past wisdom tooth removal) and gave us a huge "sample" of a salted caramel gelato when we couldn't decide between a few desserts. I wouldn't way service is slow as others complained, I think the atmosphere is meant to be that way.</Review><time>1476564984987< /time>< Gmap_id>

Nice service! The oysters and fried calamari are very good. But the cod is a bit overcooked, and the linguini (with prawns) doesn't have too much flavor. With that price, I would go Cliff house instead..< /Review>

I've eaten at this one and the one in Sausalito. I like the one in Saulsalito a little better, because you have a great view of the bay and the city while eating. The food is delicious! It's a great place to take friends from out of town, so they can try San Francisco seafood.< /Review>

If you think Olive Garden is fancy, then you're in for a treat.
Every thing about Scoma's is dated and out of style but screams a desperate attempt at the appearance of class. Wood paneling, conference room seating and walls of photographs of celebrities no one under 40 can name.
The food was fresh and edible, but the dishes are the very definition of boring and poorly executed by what I assume are novice chefs.
The waitstaff are, from my experience, old, slow, dressed in the typical steak house white jacket/black pants and walk with a sad, hunched, shuffling gait.
Scoma's antiquity would be endearing, if the food were not so painfully boring.<//Review>

The best place for fish in San francisco, period!  Try the Pacific Sole. Guaranteed to please. Some of the best crabcakes I've ever eaten. Excellent wine selection. Friendly staff.  Reservations suggested. I never miss a chance to eat at Scomas when I visit SF!</text>

If you think Olive Garden is fancy, then you're in for a treat.
Every thing about Scoma's is dated and out of style but screams a desperate attempt at the appearance of class. Wood paneling, conference room seating and walls of photographs of celebrities no one under 40 can name.
The food was fresh and edible, but the dishes are the very definition of boring and poorly executed by what I assume are novice chefs.
The waitstaff are, from my experience, old, slow, dressed in the typical steak house white jacket/black pants and walk with a sad, hunched, shuffling gait.
Scoma's antiquity would be endearing, if the food were not so painfully boring.<//Review>

<review>Nice service! The oysters and fried calamari are very good. But the cod is a bit overcooked, and the linguini (with prawns) doesn't have too much flavor. With that price, I would go Cliff house instead..<//review><userid>107299327370286263807</userid><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

O'my is it ever wonderful, the food is spot on and the service is great. Seating can be a little tight, but since we had no reservations we couldn't complain. We had the "clams & pasta" clams braised in butter, olive oil, garlic & white wine, the roasted beet salad, and Denver Sole lightly sauteed. White wine and some yummy hot bread. Each course was served separately...we rolled out because the portions were ample enough to share. AND WE WILL RETURN!!!</Review>< pics>

<text>We went there on 19 th sept seated and
All very frIedly but there seemed to be friction
When we inquired about the size of the meals
As the ladies were not big eaters it all went downhill from here the waiter became pushy
And condescending sensing we were tourists
Australian when we asked another  question
He grunted “tourist” gave us the bill and walked
Off. Then expect a tip
I feel some education in customer service
Would  be money well spent but rest assured  it
Won’t be ours
The food was good the service  and attitude of the staff was sadly lacking
We won’t be recommending this place purely
Because of the way we were treated .
Walk a couple of 100 meters past the entrance plenty of places 10 times cheaper and better food and friendly Cheerful welcoming staff

The hostess seated us near the service area at the end of the restaurant even though there were so many tables available at the elevated level of the restaurant. Only caucasians were led to the large elevated room while asians were put together in another smaller closed off area. Disappointed to see such blatant racism even today in a city which is so cosmopolitan.</review>

<Date>1281729393440< /Date><Rating>3</Rating><text>I live in the Bay Area but only recently visited Scoma's for the first time.  Unfortunately, it didn't exactly meet my expectations.  The food was ok but was pretty bland, and the menu seemed severely lacking in creativity.  The fact that they give you free parking is great, but I found the prices pretty high for the quality of the meal.  Perhaps worth trying once, but I'm not sure I'll go back.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Definitely the best clam chowder I had. They had large clam pieces. The crab cocktail could've used less sauce. But I'm looking forward to go back and try their othet food.< /Review>

Scoma atmosphere is dated, with 1990's seafood resteraunt feel.  The resteraunt is clean and we'll maintained.  Food offerings are good and prepared well. I had the salmon.  Expect a wait unless you sit at the bar which is typically full also.  Customer service was neutral, maybe because of workload, but I didn't find the service pleasant.<//Review>

We went there on 19 th sept seated and
All very frIedly but there seemed to be friction
When we inquired about the size of the meals
As the ladies were not big eaters it all went downhill from here the waiter became pushy
And condescending sensing we were tourists
Australian when we asked another  question
He grunted “tourist” gave us the bill and walked
Off. Then expect a tip
I feel some education in customer service
Would  be money well spent but rest assured  it
Won’t be ours
The food was good the service  and attitude of the staff was sadly lacking
We won’t be recommending this place purely
Because of the way we were treated .
Walk a couple of 100 meters past the entrance plenty of places 10 times cheaper and better food and friendly Cheerful welcoming staff

Love scomas restaurant. The food is consistently delicious and fresh. The service is wonderful. Views are beautiful and I have not had a menu item that I ever was disappointed with. Stronglyr ecommend this Restaurant over the other wharf restaurants as Scomas food is much superior in quality, taste and with presentation as well. Worth the money spent.<//text>

Overpriced and mediochre.   We did get excellent service, but $9 draft beers, and a $40 entree that was three tiny pieces of grilled fish and 2 prawns on a bed of orzo and diced veggies?   Gimmee a break.< /Text>

Prawns were fried and greasy, veggies and orzo that came with it were meh, crab bisque barely had any crab in it, market crab was good. All overpriced for the quality. Outdated atmosphere. I was really disappointed.<//Text>

<text>I was very excited to try this place but I must say it was all hype.  The salmon was grossly over cooked to well-done (dry).  The service was horrible.  My waiter was an elderly man who had trouble hearing but that wasn't a problem.  The problem was that he visited our table once during the entire meal which was only to bring the check.  Catching him while passing by was a task and it was as though we were bothering him.  This a disappointing experience overall but on a positive note my wife enjoyed the roasted whole crab.  Won't be back for sure.</text>< pics>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>Popped in right before they were closing to grab a couple glasses of wine and some calamari. Best part of the evening is the fact we were driven here in a brand new Bentley flying spur, which was awesome, so it began with us leaving AT&T park after watching USC crush CAL (Fight On), so we proceeded to try and catch a cab, but with no luck we walked down to the  St. Regis to catch a drink and instead were greeted by the doormen offering the house car for a tour of San Francisco. We accepted.
The driver opened the doors to the beautiful car, we got in, and drove us all over the city showing us different sites and telling us a little history about each location, while my fiance and I sat in back worried that we smelled funny after our rooftop tailgate before the game with friends, but he didn't seem to notice, and we certainly weren't going to bring it up.
After he took us to a few wine bars he inquired about our lust for seafood and asked if he could suggest a spot, so we obliged and he took us to Scoma, but not before making sure a table was ready for us. We arrived and were greeted by an amazing staff and enjoyed some great bites to eat while sipping a fantastic Malbec.
The long and short of it is this, we had a great evening with great food and wine, which cannot be beat by much.</Text>< Pics>

We visit San Francisco often and seek out good food while we travel. Scomas is a restaurant that was recommended more than once by others.
We finally tried the restaurant and we have to say it is excellent. Ask the waiters what is good and they will advise you...you wont be disappointed.
We tried a few dishes and will make Scomas a regular stop when in S.F.<//Text>

We ordered the calamari alla pancha which was the perfect amount of spicy. It was accompanied  with a delicous corn bread that balanced out the citrus of the bed of tomato sauce. We also ordered the Pacific Black Cod drizzled in a cream sauce with seasonal vegetables and crispy potatoes. Food was fantastic. Service was amazing. Portion sizes need a bit of work. We still felt a little hungry after our meal. Still a recommended spot.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

30 minute wait, ramp in to establishment with wheelchair lift to dinning area. Crab Louie Salad was enough for two, crab cakes were delish, also try a Bloody Mary.</review>

Casey made a proper Woodford double oaked Manhattan.  The Fritto Misto appetizer had a nice touch of fresh lemon zest on the local and fresh anchovies.  The cioppino entree had a great base and a generous portion of seafood.  Overall a flawless delivery of eats and drinks.  Great service.  Retro modern digs.  Prices more than par for the segment.  Portions more than par.  A hearty 5 stars in the middle of a sea of touristy mediocrity.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Prawns were fried and greasy, veggies and orzo that came with it were meh, crab bisque barely had any crab in it, market crab was good. All overpriced for the quality. Outdated atmosphere. I was really disappointed.< /Text>

<text>Old school food. The grilled seafood platter was 3 x pieces of Over cooked bland fish. They know how to fill simple dishes. The only good thing is that the sizes where so small so it too painful to eat them. This is ap,ace that is designed for topical America that love cover protein with sauces. I don't understand why it's still so busy. I give this place another 5 years when all their regulars and employees will be dead as they are all so old it's like going into the Madame Trussaud wax museum. The worst dine experience in San Fran I ever had in my many visits.</text>< pics>

This is an old restaurant that is trying to be old-style elegant. It isn't anything but old style anymore. Yes, the waiters wear white jackets, but the paneling in the dining room just looks...old. The prices are high, even for Fisherman's Wharf. Typical entree is $30+. The service is not excellent. When we arrived it was a very light Monday night crowd, but the hostess would not seat us until our friend who was parking the car arrived five minutes later. When you are really busy I can see this, but not if the restaurant is more than half empty. The quality of the food is mixed. My wife had lamb chops. Two were excellent, one was raw...and tasteless. I had swordfish in a picatta sauce. The fish was excellent, but the sauce was thin. Bottomline: there are better seafood restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf.<//Text>

<Review>Lively atmosphere with much to watch while you wait. Food is a mixed bag: stick with the simple and straightforward seafood dishes.  Service was formal to the point of being punctillious: but also oddlly sneering and suspicious - the only place during a month in the USA to decline my debit card.<//Review><Time>1399652563829</Time>< UserId.>

Everyone was very polite. Our server was one of the best!  He made our visit to the city that much better.  I'm sad to say as writing this I can't recall his name :( though I know all servers here will give the same quality service.  The entrées were delicious.  My steak (their version of Kobe)omg, mouth watering.  The purple potatoes were cooked perfectly!  Soft inside with slightly roasted outside.  I did not add salt or pepper to my meal.  That's a sign it was cooked to perfection. My father's meal was also perfect. Our dessert was decadent.  We will definitely visit Scomas next time we're in the city!</review><Name>Brooke Carroll<//Name></record></dataset><record>

<review>Old school food. The grilled seafood platter was 3 x pieces of Over cooked bland fish. They know how to fill simple dishes. The only good thing is that the sizes where so small so it too painful to eat them. This is ap,ace that is designed for topical America that love cover protein with sauces. I don't understand why it's still so busy. I give this place another 5 years when all their regulars and employees will be dead as they are all so old it's like going into the Madame Trussaud wax museum. The worst dine experience in San Fran I ever had in my many visits.</review>< Rating>

We were there yesterday 9/29/19 and the lady in the front desk was rude and didn’t give us a table until the rest of the group showed up because they were parking the car so we had to wait for 10 minutes so I called my son to make sure if they were close enough and they were5 minutes away and I asked the lady if she can give us a table and she refused to do it again so disappointed 😡<//text>

Hopefully it was just a misunderstanding. Our policy, that most top restaurants in town share, is to only seat a party when it is complete. Otherwise, our servers have to come by extra times as the other people arrive, throwing off the entire flow of the restaurant. We hope you understand. However, we offer complimentary valet parking right at our front door so there should never be any wait at all. Hopefully your meal went well when your party arrived and we hope to see you back soon!"}<//resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Scoma's is a legacy, but they are just fundamentally being outgrown. Wish they would pare down the menu, update the decor a little bit, and put a little more attention on the waitstaff's skills.

Service was good, appropriately polite and attentive, but kind of clumsy in execution for the intended ambience. E.g. reaching over other guests to serve plates and grate cheese, or forgetting which plate goes where, or just generally awkward interruptions in table conversation and rushed ordering. To be fair, we sat at the bar tables instead of waiting for our reservation.

Food was good but not great. My Bolognese was obviously fresh but the papardelle was sticking and the sauce wasn't much to write home about. Table bread was cold.

I recognize that I'm likely being picky on the details, but based upon the price of the meal, my expectations were higher.

Not 5 stars, but otherwise a good meal and quality service.</Review>

<Text>Smacks of a dying restaurant.  Most of the fish seemed to be from the east coast.  The ingredients  were inexpensive and overcooked, but not inexpensive prices.  The staff was more interested in watching tv at the noisy bar than serving customers.

Fisherman's Wharf has many great restaurants; this is not one of them.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>We were disappointed in the food and the sitting arrangements. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time but they seated us anyway which was great! However the tables were so close we could not have a private conversation and could certainly hear other table's conversations.  Did not have a nice view either.  The service was pretty good but did not care for the food. Don't get the Dungeness Crab Thermidor Gratinato unless you love onions and not much crab. The Wagyu Bistro Filet was okay and Polenta was good.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Lively atmosphere with much to watch while you wait. Food is a mixed bag: stick with the simple and straightforward seafood dishes.  Service was formal to the point of being punctillious: but also oddlly sneering and suspicious - the only place during a month in the USA to decline my debit card.</review>

Zagat must be slipping... apparently a 25 means: salads made from brown, wilted, store-bought pre-prepared mixes that sat in the back of the fridge too long, mediocre wine selections and crab so overcooked you have to chew on it like a strap of leather.  If you want better seafood, go to a Red Lobster.  Scoma's was singularly terrible in that regard.  No complaints about the atmosphere or the waitstaff though, they did a great job.  It was too bad that when they asked me how everything was, the only nice thing I could say was that the bread was great (and it was).</Review>

Ordered bistro filet, wagyu sirloin cut with smashed potatoes, and raw sliced carrots. Presentation wasn't great. Carrots were right; raw and edible. Smashed potatoes were right and cooked well. The 9 oz filet by no means looked like 9oz it was dished up cut in half. The temperature of the steak was more like medium than what was ordered which was supposed to be medium rare. I have had more flavorful and more tender steaks at a chain restaurant.

The waiter Chris was nice and courteous.<//Text>

<Review>Was sold this restraunt as the best seafood Fishermans wharf had to offer . Ordered the three main specialty dishes on the menu. Scallops were to die for. Amazing. But that was about it . For the price , disappointed . For 280 ( 350 AUD) bucks for 4 people. Sydney fish markets could do for about 120 bucks . Maybe my expectations were to high .< /Review></record>

<Review>Scoma's is a legacy, but they are just fundamentally being outgrown. Wish they would pare down the menu, update the decor a little bit, and put a little more attention on the waitstaff's skills.

Service was good, appropriately polite and attentive, but kind of clumsy in execution for the intended ambience. E.g. reaching over other guests to serve plates and grate cheese, or forgetting which plate goes where, or just generally awkward interruptions in table conversation and rushed ordering. To be fair, we sat at the bar tables instead of waiting for our reservation.

Food was good but not great. My Bolognese was obviously fresh but the papardelle was sticking and the sauce wasn't much to write home about. Table bread was cold.

I recognize that I'm likely being picky on the details, but based upon the price of the meal, my expectations were higher.

Not 5 stars, but otherwise a good meal and quality service.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//Gmap_id><rate>4<//rate>< time>

Walked in off the street and had about a 15 minute wait to be seated. It was a fairly busy day so there was no place to sit while we waited. They use a texting service to let you know your table is ready, so we just walked around outside.

We started with the fried calamari and it was very good - they cooked it differently then we've ever had it before - big pieces (great dipping sauce too).

After the calamari, we were all actually pretty full so we weren't as hungry for dinner as we would have liked. We had swordfish, shrimp in egg batter and ahi. All were cooked well and tasted good, but not amazing.

Great views from the restaurant, super service, will come back to try the clam chowder!</text>

<Review>Was sold this restraunt as the best seafood Fishermans wharf had to offer . Ordered the three main specialty dishes on the menu. Scallops were to die for. Amazing. But that was about it . For the price , disappointed . For 280 ( 350 AUD) bucks for 4 people. Sydney fish markets could do for about 120 bucks . Maybe my expectations were to high .</Review>< pictures>

I ordered the mixed seafood linguini dish which arrived looking appetizing. However, the mussels tasted pungent, the clams didn’t open up all the way, AND the salmon chunks were SPOILED! When I told the waiter about the clams, he gave me a knife to pry them open. I then discovered the spoiled salmon and send the dish back. The writer smelled it and agreed that it had gone bad. A fresh plate came half and hour later and the flavor was good. However, I developed an upset stomach thereafter and my afternoon/ evening was spoiled. I was glad I didn’t feed this to my 1.5 year old toddler. For a restaurant that has a high turnover and claims to be high in quality, this was an awful experience. No one apologized and the full price of the dish was on the bill.<//review>

Scomas's is an excellent restaurant with great food and fantastic views. The crab (steamed) was great w capers. The garlic shrimp w/ rice aoli was fantastic too. I would highly recommend.< /Text>

<review>Skip this place. It was recommended to us and we went to this classic and long-established restaurant. A short wait at the bar and we were eating. The service from Jose was friendly, but the food was at best average, and the prices are high ($110 (incl tip) for dinner for 2, no apps or dessert and 2 beer/wine each). The fresh wild salmon was utterly unremarkable, slightly overcooked and with little flavor (I could have easily done better at home any number of ways), and the pasta with sausage was OK but overwhelmed by black olives. Perhaps other things on the menu are better, but at these prices I can't see coming back to eat my way through the menu to find something better than average. Spend your money elsewhere.

Having visited this Scoma's for the first time, in 1985, this place has been incredible every time I have visited it, ever since that time. It would appear that they have adhered to their unremitting dedication to being at the top of their game; and have thrived ever since.<//review>

For a touristy restaurant, it's the grand dame.  Incredibly fresh seafood, outstanding views, and solicitious service make it a 3 star winner.<//Text>

Calamari alla Plancha was the best calamari dish I have ever enjoyed. The filet was phenomenal, texture and flavour! Our easier was wonderfully professional and helpful south our orders. The entire experience was FAR above what I expected from anything in the tourist district. This is not a tourist restaurant. They are pros. As a New Orleanean, I know great food and service... and Scoma's delivered!<//review>

If you have to eat at the Wharf, of entertain visitors. The Cioppino is still very good, the view magnificent, the wines top notch. All can be foudn better elsewhere, but the combination at a national landmark is hard to beat.<//Review>

Not bad, but way overpriced. You can do much better for much less outside the tourist trap.</Review>

<name>Brenda Harvey</name><Text>We on a whim decided to go to Fisherman's Warf. Found Scoma's and decided we need not go any further. I mean what could be better than eating fresh fish right off the warf. We were not dissapointed!!! The food was amazing best Cod, Scallops,Shrimp, Salad and Fried Calimari ever. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and a pleasure. Thank you all from Top to Bottom fir your excellence. I will defiantly return. Blessings!!!<//Text>< rate>

Van, our waiter (maybe Dan - older gentleman from Chicago) told me it was good, gave me a description, and I, a lady who doesn't like strong tasting fish, LOVED IT!!!!  We started with soup, my husband had clam chowder, I had the lobster bisque. Excellent start to a wonderful meal. We finished with the 7 layer cake; chocolatey, hazelnutty, creamy, crunchy, but not over sweet. The perfect end to a perfect meal! The only part of the meal not extraordinary was the bread - just ordinary bread that was cold in the center. Thank you Scomas for an absolutely delicious meal. Parking is valet - when you start down Al Scomas Way, go over the bridge, make the turn and the valets take it from there. No charge (we tipped).< /Review><user>106722577590802922101< /user><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmap_id>< Time>

If you have to eat at the Wharf, of entertain visitors. The Cioppino is still very good, the view magnificent, the wines top notch. All can be foudn better elsewhere, but the combination at a national landmark is hard to beat.<//text>

<rate>2< /rate><review>This is an "Old School" Italian Seafood Restaurant.....perfect.....our two most favorite foods (Italian and Seafood) and we LOVE anything "Old School."
Upon entering.....you immediately get the 60's vibe.  We went for My 50th Birthday lunch....so had every intention of hanging for a bit with a bottle of wine and of course some Birthday dessert.....all those things that really help to run up the bill....and we didn't care one bit. We were seated in the back upper level. The dining room was not very big and they made sure to seat everyone in one section so it was hard to have any real conversation. We ordered a cocktail while looking over the menu. We both decided on Seafood. My husband ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Dungeness Crab Salad, with a bottle of wine to come w/the meal. Our lunches were brought to the table and as soon as the server walked away, my husband looked at his fish and said "this doesn't look good"  I looked at the fish and could see what he was talking about.....it looked so dried out. He took a few bites and it was awful. My salad was ok....it was supposed to be shelled crab. Of course every bite I took, I had to pull shell out of my mouth. Shelled=Means no shell or cartilage. I can understand a bite or two w/shell but this was ridiculous. The server forgot the wine and we were so glad.....because we were so unhappy that we just wanted to get out of there.  We couldn't believe this is what was served for the price. Our bill was was $125......before tip.  We didn't bother to send the food back because we figured everything was going to come out just as bad.  So totally disappointed! I think the chef needs more training or they need to have better quality control. Would NEVER recommend this establishment.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

One of the few restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf does does a nice job. The Cioppino is 5 star, other menu favorites are Shrimp and Scallops alla Gannon and Shellfish Sauté Sec.

Only be overpriced knocks them down one star.</text>

I have been to Scoma's now four times over the course of nine years. I have had wonderful experiences every time. The views are beautiful and the seafood is GREAT! I have never had such good seafood. I have had the  Dungeness crab cocktail, Gulf shrimp pastina, and the whole dungeness crab. Each of which were AMAZING! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area. I think it goes unrecognized because it is down an alley toward the warf. I will be back sometime again in the future.<//review>

We checked online and yelp and found it is a great place to go but very disappointed. Food are not as advertised "fresh" seafood, the seafood looks very frozen prior.....not taste and not too many people there. I will not recommend it. I believe it was a good place and talked to people that night, the restaurant goes downhill recent years.< /text>

The food was excellent and so was the service. We didn't have a reservation, so the wait was long, but it allowed us to do some additional walking around at the pier and the food was definitely worth the wait.</Review>

Magic... from the service and setting to the reheated leftover linguini democratica  (frutti di mar) the next day.  An absolute gem off the beaten path.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Not too stuffy either, a very relaxed and fun atmosphere.<//review>

Last time I went there was 7 years ago. I remember having halibut. No halibut this time only cod and salmon. Sad.. I could have gotten those at any other restaurants around.<//text>

The clam chowder is delish. You can valet your car out front, no need to pay for the parking garage.< /Review>

Nice seafood,  very good local crab, good wines by the glass,  friendly and efficient staff.  Price vs quality probably not bad for the area although overpriced in my view. Would definitely recommend it though if you're in the area.< /Text>

< Review>
Went to resturant on recomendation. Expected fresh fish off the boat but they had none. No specials. Food was overpriced, but your paying for the area. Waiter was a older gentelman and very surley, service was sub par. Location was great. The meals that were ordered were fast and of average quality. I would not recomend.<//Review>

Gang:

This Restaurant is tops, the sourdough frenchbread is the best!!

Yes it is busy but so are all great places... so be smart if you are going to be on the Wharf, make rez & go window shopping & come back in an hour enjoy it dont sweat it.

But.... I hate the rez booth up 4-5 feet above your head ..."strange"
Bottomline after dinner go to the Buena Vista a few blocks away!!

Have a great time Mike #32<//text>

{'time': 1592014083583, 'text': "Yuri, if you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up, please know Scoma's has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\nThis is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales.\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation."}</Resp>

We've been to Scoma's many times over the years while visiting San Francisco and have always enjoyed our meals here, but we were disappointed on this trip. The service as always was outstanding, but the food was not as good as it has been in the past. Lots of money for lunch that was at best mediocre.<//Review>

Outrageously overrated. Anyone who likes this place must usually eat at the Olive Garden. The wait staff was disinterested at best, and for the (stupidly high) price the food was unimpressive. Eat there if you must, but there are better places.</text>

Water was not served 10 minutes after seated down. Server did not pick up order for at least 15 minutes. Not recommended this place for its awful service.< /text>

A surprising gem among the tourist trap wasteland that is Fisherman's Wharf.

A bit pricey perhaps, but they've got solid seafood.<//Text>

<Review>Our experience at Scomas San Francisco was delightful. The food was delicious and the fish was perfectly cooked. The best part of the meal was Tim our waiter. He was funny, sassy and knowledgeable. He made our dining there extremely enjoyable. I would definitely go back and ask for Tim.<//Review>< response>

(Translated by Google) Great service from the charming waiters in a fish restaurant, in whose nostalgic interior you immediately lose yourself :-) If you want to go out to eat in style without dressing too chic, this is the place for you. Portions are big enough, prices are high for German standards (a large shrimp salad around 45 euros), but tasty.

(Original)
Super Service durch die charmanten Kellner in einem Fischrestaurant, in dessen nostalgischem Interieur man sich sofort verliert :-) wer stilvoll Essengehen möchte, ohne sich dafür zu chic kleiden zu wollen, ist hier richtig. Portionen sind ausreichend  groß, Preise sind für deutsche Verhältnisse gehoben (ein großer Krabbensalat um die 45 Euro), dennoch lecker.< /Text>

I ordered a glass of beer for this and it cost $ 100 including a tip. The price is high, but I am satisfied with the taste and service.

<text>(Translated by Google) Seeing a lot of delicious reviews, we drove over to eat. It doesn’t matter if the price is expensive. As long as the seafood is fresh and delicious, everything is worth it, but it’s not the case. The checkout is faster than $200. Crabs are not fresh. ! We grew up eating fresh crabs!

(Original)
看到很多好吃的評論，我們特地開車過來吃，價格昂貴沒有關係，只要海鮮是新鮮好吃，一切都值得，但事實並不如此，結帳快200多美金，螃蟹不是新鮮的，天啊！我們可是吃新鮮螃蟹長大的啊！< /text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) A small restaurant hidden in the fishing port of San Francisco
The sunset outside the window is paired with simple and extraordinary food
An endless stream of people, full of the human touch of the store
I don’t feel messy, but warm and relaxed

藏身舊金山漁港內的小餐館
窗外的晚霞 搭配著簡易不平凡的美食
絡繹不絕的人潮 充滿店家滿滿的人情味
竟不覺得糟雜 而是感到溫馨與放鬆<//Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The food is good, especially the crab sauce fried garlic cream is delicious, but the food price is very expensive, the service staff is older, the age of guests is also higher, creating a traditional American-style human service, more suitable for older people . Expensive is the only disadvantage I have seen. After the meal, lemon and hot towel will be provided.

(Original)
食物不錯，尤其螃蟹的醬料炸蒜香奶油很好吃，但是食物價格很貴，服務人員年齡偏高，客人年齡層也偏高，營造出傳統美式富有人情味的服務，較適合年長的人。貴是我看到的唯一缺點。用餐完會提供檸檬跟熱毛巾。<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) A classic Italian seafood restaurant on the water in San Francisco. They have a great selection of fish, seafood, crab and a single steak.
The dishes are on the expensive end - $ 35-40 for a main course, but the portions are large so you can plentifully settle for a lunch. We got Linguine alla Vongole and Pasta Putanesca. The wine is pricey and OK. The beers are cheaper. Their double IPA is fantastic. Try a cocktail while you wait. The lemon kiss (Bacio al Limone) is excellent.
The service is classic, good and attentive.
Can be recommended if you can afford it.

En klassisk italiensk seafood restaurant på vandet i San Francisco. De har et stort udvalg af fisk, skaldyr, krabbe og en enkelt bøf.
Retterne er i den dyre ende - 35-40$ for en hovedret, men portionerne er store, så man kan rigeligt nøjes med en ret til frokost. Vi fik Linguine alla Vongole og Pasta Putanesca . Vinen er dyr og OK. Øllene er billigere. Deres double IPA er fantastisk. Smag gerne en cocktail, mens du venter. Citronkys (Bacio al Limone) er fremragende.
Betjeningen er klassisk, god og opmærksom.
Kan anbefales, hvis man har råd til det.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsxC52uEe6fJqx620G68O1XcqyijajtSOCqhrt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_ZvQ4Zt6qbIGTm0S9wgUE3h8R8xjQBaaXrf_0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ6iH8f0d1gFGPAAophi1WRa7lrtthu2Gr7vRd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-kGIGgACYdo4Bwkm_H_mKpGd8gnyFTR7sofN2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaRn_b496IVizmD2Plx7Lor4f9p0tXk2nkDFTD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsoiM7KUN2x27Le-bhz9M1VrrC9XWlgQU9A6X-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsVadP7VEgbrD7N5kF7IHyW7c_448SvGFjN0GN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzATkM_bT0BGOdWWJEFQpWaGPxgs8idDntQ62i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWM2i6HqBl-lLufvGbSB_c43HG97WSyxUBppd6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRmT1sJwVCpOJ_LhsmwOSdn2G8dVPY1rpBrCGS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Seafood restaurant located in the port of San Francisco. The quality of the food quite bad, products without flavor, the spaghetti vongole undercooked and with a lot of liquid (we assume that they were not drained). The cesar salad was 4 regular lettuce leaves and 4 very salty croutons. Seafood quite tasteless. Very expensive for its quality and the living room needs updating after years.

(Original)
Restaurante marisquería situado en el puerto de San Francisco. La calidad de la comida bastante mala, productos sin sabor, los espaguetis vongole mal cocinados y con mucho líquido (suponemos de no haberlos escurrido). La ensalada cesar eran 4 hojas de lechuga regulares y con 4 crustones muy salados. El marisco bastante insípidos. Muy caro para su calidad y el salón necesita una reforma después de años.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Seafood restaurant on the pier. The dishes are fresh and designed, the service impeccable. The quality is medium. I ate steak, very ordinary. Excessive prices, the cost of three meals in the city. You can skip.

(Translated by Google) Seafood at Pier 39 is a high end. Of course you can enter comfortably without the dress code. There is a little price. 2 beer, 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 160 for US $ 200,000

Chiofino delicious! Kkalra Marie Fries, Cram chowder is also good
The grill is saw

Pyeonyira weighted long side haldeut reservations. If you search a beer or a cocktail at the bar while waiting. Immediately gave instructions do not just sit down to wait in the bar located off the table when the zoom menu

(Original)
피어 39 에서 해산물 음식으로는 하이엔드. 물론 드레스 코드 없이 편하게 들어갈 수 있음. 가격은 조금 있는편. 맥주2, 에피타이저 2, 메인 2, 하면 한국 돈 20만원 정도 달러로는 160 (팁 포함)

치오피노 맛있음! 깔라마리 튀김, 크램차우더도 굿
그릴은 쏘쏘

웨이팅이 긴편이라 예약이 편할듯. 기다리는 동안 바에서 맥주나 칵테일 한잔하면 됨. 따로 바로 안내는 안해주니 그냥 바 자리에 앉아서 테이블 기다린다고 하면 메뉴 줌<//review>

(Translated by Google) A really nice local authentic American beach restaurant in a slightly secluded location, Mainly with Italian food. The price range is not even high compared to local prices. The taste, on the other hand, is great. The service is very nice. You can always chat with other guests.

(Original)
Egy igazán szép helyi autentikus amerikai tengerparti étterem, kicsit eldugott helyen, Főként olasz ételekkel. Az árfekvés a helyi árakhoz képest nem is magasak. Az ízvilág viszont nagyszerű. Nagyon kedves a kiszolgálás. Mindig lehet beszélgetni a többi vendéggel is.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Perhaps the restaurant I tried in the USA, which looks more like an Italian restaurant. The white jacket waiters, in keeping with the decor and part of the menu, seem to come directly from the 60s. Good food, nice staff. Not really cheap.

(Translated by Google) It is a seafood restaurant.
As it is a popular shop in this area, reservations are necessary.
The clam chowder was very delicious.
If you have ginkgo, salmon, halibut, etc., you should ask them to share and eat separately.
You can enjoy various tastes.
There is no complaint.

(Original)
シーフードの料理の店です。

<review>(Translated by Google) We went to the restaurant at around 10/19 pm this year, ordered a bottle of sparkling water, and also had two children to dine. During the period, the mouth was very thirsty, but we found that there was water and bread on the table around us. I don't know if it's because we are Asian, the whole feeling is very bad! ! The service is not in place, the overall restaurant tastes OK but the cost is too expensive!

我們在今年10/19下午一點左右去餐廳用餐，點的一瓶氣泡水，另外還帶著兩個小孩用餐，期間口很渴，卻發現周圍的餐桌上都有水跟麵包我們卻都沒有，不曉得是否因為我們是亞洲人的關係，整個感覺很差！！服務也沒到位，整體餐廳口味還可以但費用太過昂貴！< /review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Perhaps the restaurant I tried in the USA, which looks more like an Italian restaurant. The white jacket waiters, in keeping with the decor and part of the menu, seem to come directly from the 60s. Good food, nice staff. Not really cheap.

(Original)

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It is a seafood restaurant.
As it is a popular shop in this area, reservations are necessary.
The clam chowder was very delicious.
If you have ginkgo, salmon, halibut, etc., you should ask them to share and eat separately.
You can enjoy various tastes.
There is no complaint.

(Original)
シーフードの料理の店です。
この地区では人気店なので、予約が必用です。
クラムチャウダーがとても美味しかったです。
銀鱈や、サーモン、オヒョウなど人数がいれば別々に頼んでシェアして食べると良いでしょう。
色々な味が楽しめて良いです。

During the period, the mouth was very thirsty, but we found that there was water and bread on the table around us. I don't know if it's because we are Asian, the whole feeling is very bad! !

<text>(Translated by Google) Raw oysters, clam chowder, it was very delicious.

Crabs are delicious, but Japan is delicious.
The crab may not have been a delicious season, but considering the price, I personally feel that it is not at a level that I recommend.
However, since crabs with garlic oil have never been eaten in Japan, there are times when you experience it. It is delicious to eat the remaining garlic oil in the pan.

The mixed seafood grill was delicious, but the taste is within the expected range, not until it breaks the expectations.
As for the Japanese people, after all seafood has a high level, ..., strengthened the completely selfish personal view.

(If you don't compare it to the food in Hokkaido, it's delicious enough. I think it's good enough if you're hoping to be able to feel that there's also delicious seafood in the US.)

(Original)
生牡蠣、クラムチャウダー、とても美味しかったです。

カニは、まあ美味しいけど、日本のが美味しいかなー。
カニが美味しい旬の時期ではなかったのかもですが、値段を考えると必ずおすすめするほどのレベルにまでにはない気が個人的にはします。
ただ、ガーリックオイルでのカニは日本では食べたことがなかったので、経験しておくのもありでしょう。残ったガーリックオイルをパンにつけて食べるのは美味しいですよ。

ミックスシーフードグリルも美味しかったけど、期待の範囲内の美味しさで、期待を突き破るまでではなく、、、
日本人のがやっぱりシーフードはレベルが高いかな、、、との全く勝手な個人的見解を強めました。

(北海道での食事と比較しなければ、十分に美味しいですよ。アメリカでも美味しいシーフードがあるんだなという気持ちになれることを期待しての訪問なら十分に良いと思います。)< /text>< rating>

(Translated by Google) The location is very good. Clam chowder has many ingredients and it is delicious, but I felt a lot of saltiness (depending on taste). I went there in winter, but oysters are very small, I think that they are not very satisfied if they are Japanese oyster lovers. It may be unusual for clams to eat raw clams. Seafood fried was quite tasty. The beer was not very cold. The staff who corresponded was very kind.

ロケーションはとても良いです。クラムチャウダーは具も多くておいしいのですのですが、私には少し塩分が多い気がしました（好みにもよると思います）。冬期に行ったのですが、牡蠣はとても小さく、日本の牡蠣好きの方だとあまり満足できないのではないかと思います。ハマグリの生が食べられるのは珍しいかもしれません。シーフードフライはなかなかおいしかったです。ビールはあまり冷えてなかったです。対応してくれたスタッフはとても親切でした。<//text>

(Translated by Google) If you want to try fresh, good quality fish and seafood of all kinds, this is the place for you. The restaurant gets its fish directly from the fishing boats. It couldn't be fresher! The price is high, but you also get extremely good service. Very friendly waiters who also help with the selection of the dishes. If you don't want to wait, a reservation is required.
For two people, we paid $ 120 for a full meal, including a tip.

Wer frischen, qualitativ guten Fisch und Meeresfrüchte aller Art probieren will, ist hier richtig. Das Restaurant bekommt seinen Fisch direkt von den Fischerbooten. Frischer geht es nicht!

Wenn man nicht warten will ist eine Reservierung erforderlich.
Für 2 Personen haben wir für eine volle Mahlzeit inkl. Trinkgeld 120 Dollar bezahlt.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) I state that during my stay in the States, speaking as an Italian, I had a lot of difficulty eating well as we do in Italy, even at renowned restaurants. In this case, however, I have to say that expectations have been largely met. excellent Sicilian dishes, oysters spectacular and best American ever drank white wine. To try.

Premetto che durante il soggiorno negli States, parlando da italiano, ho avuto parecchie difficoltà nel mangiar bene come da noi in Italia, anche presso ristoranti blasonati. In questo caso però, devo dire che le aspettative sono state ampiamente soddisfatte. Piatti siciliani ottimi, Ostriche spettacolari e miglior vino bianco statunitense mai bevuto.

(Translated by Google) Fisherman's Wharf's long-established Italian seafood. We recommend the classic tomato-based seafood stew cioppino. There are 4-5 people lightly, so the veteran waiter recommended a small crab cakes (appetizer size). (Dinner size comes with 3 crab cakes with pasta)

<Review>(Translated by Google) Because this meal has a great impression on Fisherman's Wharf, it is not enough to eat all the seafood services that you want to eat about 45 knives per person. The crab is very fat and the lobster is also tender and tender. Because I wanted to eat butter mushroom sauce and want to eat onion sauce, the chef specially made these three kinds of sauces for us, which was surprisingly delicious. It was a bit unpleasant to find a seat at first, but then another grandfather asked us in detail about what we wanted to eat and how to do it. Specifically, we changed the plate and pepper for many times, and asked for a good meal at the right time. Sour bread is free and there is a free lemon hot handkerchief, which is always recommended by conscience!

(Original)
因为这顿饭对渔人码头印象超棒啊，人均45刀左右能吃到所有想吃的海鲜服务没得说。螃蟹非常肥美龙虾也是外焦里嫩。因为既想吃奶油蘑菇酱又想吃洋葱酱，主厨为我们特意做了这三样酱汁混合的，出奇意料的好吃。一开始找座子有点不愉快，但是之后又一位大爷为我们详细询问介绍我们想吃什么以及怎么做。特意为我们换了好多次盘子加胡椒粉，在恰到好处的时间来询问是否用餐愉快。酸面包是免费的还有免费的柠檬热手帕，总而言之良心推荐！< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

By cons quantities are there.
But nice corner. Not sure that it is just as pleasant during the tourist season.

(Translated by Google) The seafood dishes eaten at tourist spots come out more than expected, not less. Of course, the price is slightly higher, but considering the characteristics of tourist spots, it is inevitable.

(Original)
관광지에서 먹는 해산물 요리 이상도 이하도 아닌 딱 기대만큼 나옵니다. 물론 가격대가 살짝 높기는 합니다만 관광지라는 특성을 고려해보면 어쩔 수 없습니다.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Really everything very good. Book by appointment because there are usually many people to eat (at least in August). As I say, every dish is more than delicious, although accustomed to the prices of Spain perhaps I saw it a bit expensive. But we already know that the United States is like that.

To eat good fish, I don't think there is any better place in Fisherman's Warf.

(Original)
Realmente todo muy bueno. Reservar con cita previa porque suele haber mucha gente para comer ( como mínimo en Agosto ). Como digo, todo plato está más que delicioso, aunque acostumbrado a los precios de España quizás lo ví un poco caro. Pero ya sabemos que estados unidos es así.

<resp>{'time': 1592014223974, 'text': 'Dmitry,  it seems like you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up. Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}< /resp><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}</Resp></record>
