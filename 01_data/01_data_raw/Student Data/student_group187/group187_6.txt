<Review>Tasty ethnic food option in the downtown area. Patrons flow through the restaurant speedily. And they refill the food when supply runsblow. So the food is always fresh and warm. The Namm bread makes the whole meal so satisfying.< /Review>< Response>

The food here is sooo good. Loved it. The Samosas were so fresh and tasty. My vegetarian meal was great and I really liked the rice.
We also had garlic Naan bread and it was great.
The service here was so friendly and nice. Overall just great.< /Review>

I like this spot! They prepare first-rate meals, their menu is large, The chief cook in that restaurant is well trained, I enjoy a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are consistently of high class, the service towards the clients  is helpful. I  go often to this restaurant and I not even once was disappointed.  I highly recommend it.<//Review>

They have an extensive Indian spread. The buffet is always on point, which can be difficult having abalance of of to much where the food gets cold and stale and too much where you're scraping the burnt bottom, but never here. This buffet have a great variety. I particularly love the different dippening sauces for the naan bread and the chicken marsala. The staff is friendly and efficient my glass was never empty.<//review>

My husband and I were visiting from out of town so we didn't really know what to expect. We were very pleased to discover a lovely restaurant with semi-outdoor seating. We had the vegetable samosas and they were delicious. The Aloo Gobi was also terrific.  The prices were very reasonable and what impressed us most was the attentiveness of the staff. Our water and tea were refilled immediately. The host and waiters checked on us often and cleared our dishes right away. We couldn't have been happier with this restaurant.< /Review>

Love Tamira! As a Santa Barbara local, I’ve eaten at Tamira quite a few times; both for the buffet lunch as well as for dinner. Every time has been excellent. The service is quick and friendly, the price is fair, the food is fresh and tasty, and I just love how it’s a family-owned business. Remi, the owner, is a super sweet man. I’ll definitely be back soon!</review>

I don't have enough room to tell you how WONDERFUL Tamira restaurant is!!! We catered a holiday party at our home for 40 people. Not only was Remmie the owner INCREDIBLE to work with, but the food was OUTSTANDING!!! What a treat for all our guests. It was very reasonably priced, and HUGE portions. I would order again and again for all my parties, and our guests raved all night about how delicious the food was. We had so many selections. It was delivered on time, and was packed in trays that were piping hot. I would recommend if you are doing a party, to go with Tamira...it won't disappoint:) I love this restaurant, and so did my guests! Thank you, Tamira for a job well done!!!!<//Review>

Got an Indian food craving? Look no further! This place has it all. Unbelievably delicious food, kind staff, very clean, and cozy environment. Remy is a very personable and amazing owner. I wouldn’t hesitate to use this place as a catering service for a wedding or event! Truly great food, service, and people.<//Text>

Favorite Indian restaurant in Santa Barbara!! Kind, family owned, and great service. The lunch buffet is a fantastic option. It’s well priced and comes with rice and naan. I recommend the masala and korma dishes. Been here twice and will definitely come again! 😋🍛< /Review>

You won’t find any place with perfect combo of pricing, quality, and service like Tamira. Honestly this place is so bomb! Their naan is sooo good and their mango smoothie is heaven. I always get the chicken tikka masala is so tasty. This is literally where I take my friends or dates whenever I’m trying to show them around.

If you go to UCSB you HAVE to try this place before you graduate. If you thought Naan Stop was good wait until you try this place out! I honestly can’t rave about this place enough. LOVE this place!

Seriously, try this place! I’m literally gonna go there again today! That’s why I even wrote this review.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Service was the best buffet service I've ever had. Selection is moderate but I believe the benefit is that everything is turned faster and fresh. The owner overseas everything and is attentive and cordial.

Food was excellent. As we were 7, we all selected a different dish and shared family style. Very flavorful but not spicy hot. Will most definitely go back when in this area.

Food is good, service is terrible. Workers are incompetent and the guy manager is rude. Took them 5 minutes to get us seated in a half empty restaurant. 15 mins to get our orders. I asked for a straw and the waiter said he will get me one but never happened. We asked to split the check. They first said they can't, then one said it's okay, then the manager said no isn't okay. You guys need to learn how to serve the public. It's not enough to have a good chief of the staff is rude/incompetent. Another time during the buffet, they kept coming to my friend asking if he is done or not. His plate was half full and he was still working on it while checking his phone.  After asking twice, one servant picked the plate up without any notice.< /Review>

This restaurant is very affordable, especially compared to other restaurants nearby. It is consistently delicious with generous servings and attentive service. I can't say enough good things about it. The one tip I can offer is to always ask for spice if you want it, otherwise they make it mild by default.<//review>

High quality Indian food in a very nice setting in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara. The staff are friendly and efficient. VERY vegan-friendly. The owner will tell you which items are vegan and also make you vegan naan bread. The lunch buffet is excellent and reasonably priced. Highly recommended.</text>

This is a lovely family owned restaurant. The service is good. The food is delicious and the price is great! The lunch buffet is so yummy and a great value. If you want a nice atmosphere with yummy food for a good value, this is the place for you 10/10 would recommend.
Also, it was just as good the second time.
The chicken Tikka masala is so good and the naan bread is delicious. They have really tasty tandoori chicken and the rice pudding is super good.</Review>

Came in at 8:50pm. They close at 9:30, but close the kitchen at 9:00? I used the restroom immediately after we sat down and when I got back, my partner said he had to order for me because the server said they were closing. I didn't even get a chance to look at the menu! They brought the two mediocre dishes out with one small bowl of rice for us to split. Seriously? I asked for more rice and they ended up charging us extra for it. The entire time we were eating, we were being rushed. If the posted hours say you're open until 9:30pm, you need have your kitchen open until then. Won't be back.<//review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Go to Tamera because the food is truly amazing and high quality. They could be slightly more generous with spices because the Fish curry is a bit bland. The Chicken Tikka Masala was spot on and lovely. Their buffet menu is fantastic. The service isn't that great as the owner is  kind of grumpy every time. The waiters don't make an effort to come check on you because they're way too busy and understaffed. All in all, the food is well worth it and the atmosphere is awesome.
Definitely try their Samosas - they're amazing.<//text>< pics>

I often eat my main meal of the day at lunch time between 12-2 p.m. I look for Fresh food from Salads to Meats. So Tamira is one of my favorite places to enjoy my lunch. They have a buffet with a wide selection of fresh tasty India Foods. The Owners & Staff are helpful & informative about the foods they serve.  The Buffet only cost $10.95 + tax.
Also for my Vegetarian friends there is also a great selection for them too. I have also been know to meet large groups of friends for Birthday celebrations there, as my friends can order from their extensive menu & we share the dishes & are never unhappy with the food, the price or the evenings celebration.  Just relax & Enjoy the good Food😊</text>

<Text>Good food at very reasonable price. I like their buffet from 11.30 to 2.30 on most days.  I wish they more.  I am actually vegan for most part and I want a place to eat everything under 12$ including tip. This place fit the description. I used to go to hymalyan kitchen but the food and chef has changed and food is mostly meat based and greasy unfortunately!! Miss the good people there though. The staff is friendly here to but not personal as kitchen!! I appreciate Tamira for providing the buffet.</Text>< pics>

<review>Great quality indian food, but not the most authentic.  The lunch buffet for $12.95 is a great value for the price.  Selection for the buffet is somewhat limited but enough to get by.<//review><user_name>nick< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Their lunch buffet is solid, not a huge list of options but there's something for everyone. If I'm especially hungry I can manage 2 plates' worth, which is absolutely worth the money.

They seem to get busy in waves; I've been in some afternoons and been the only one in there and others I've had to search for a table.< /text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Came for a late lunch buffet. The staff was pretty kind and the place was very clean. There wasn't a wide range of options in the buffet, however the food quality was over the average (neither too salty nor too spicy at all). Tried the tandoori chicken, which was perfectly marinated and grilled (maybe a little bit dry). I also tried some of the vegetable options, which were good, especially the aloo zucchini and potato. The chicken tikka masala was OK. There were some other fresh salad items such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions cucumber, carrots, etc. as well as pilaf and white rice. The dessert options weren't nothing special, just diced pineapple and rice pudding. At 2:30 pm, when the buffet closed, I asked for more tandoori chicken, and the manager gently brought me some extra pieces. A really nice gesture.
We paid $9.95 + tax, which is a good deal comparing to most of Indian buffets.<//text>< UserId.>

Been here quite a few times. The staff is very polite and prompt and treats their regulars well. Lots of great vegetarian options; I especially enjoy malai kofta with plain or garlic naan.</Text>

This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Santa Barbara or Ventura areas. They have a very good lunch buffet and their service is excellent and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant and am very grateful they are open.  Keep up the good work Tamira!<//Review>

I went here because I wanted a halal cuisine and I like Indian food as well. The portions were okay, the lamb Korma was below my expectations, tandoori chicken was not so good, and the chicken tikka masala was too watery. Nevertheless the service was good and the prices were inexpensive.< /text>

<review>The service here is slow. You have to ask 3 staff for 1 piece of naan bread and it takes them literally over 15 minutes for 1 naan bread. Also, it does not matter if you are alone or a bigger group, they will only give 1 naan bread at a time. Btw, it was a buffet. Otherwise, food is good.</review>< gmapID>

< Review>
I highly recommend this place because for around $10 you get all you can eat appetizers, entrees, rice, naan, and my favorite, riatta, and their riatta is SO good. If they add 2 more options to their menu, I would change my review to a 5-star. Very great service too. In fact I would say it's more of a 4.5.< /Review>

Bad attitude of the owner towards his customers. The owner was annoyed when I asked for more naan, despite my already asking for it more than 5 minutes ago.< /text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>They have a decent lunch buffet. It can get busy during lunch but they usually offer tandoori chicken which tends to be on the drier side. It's Indian so there is always a dahal, another vegetarian option, chicken tikka masala (which is usually good) and usually one other chicken curry dish.

The downside to it being busy is that they run out of items frequently. Make sure to mention it to one of the staff as they don't check as often as they should.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>The manager offered no smile and sounded too rude, using lots of "Go Ahead!" instead of a simple "Please!" or another polite expression.
Both 'Aloo Gobi' and 'Gulab Jamun' were from last night if not older. Potatoes in 'Aloo Gobi' were decolorized due to overheating and 'Gulab Jamun' dumplings were too leathery. Basmati rice was equally unimpressive.
Not recommended if you're a seasoned South Asian foodie.</text><rate>2< /rate>< response>

<Text>Over priced and the food is just bad. We went for the buffet. Chicken chilly had raw chicken. I couldn't even cut through the piece. There weren't options or variety for such high price and the food was not just disappointing and unauthenticate, but seemed stale and tasteless<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
Food was okay, but terrible service. I ordered a medium spice bhaingan barta; instead, they gave me a really spicy one. After telling them that they got the wrong order; they rudely refused to admit it -- so I ended up eating the food which left my stomach very irritable (my stomach cannot handle spicy food!).

Just a side note, if you come for dinner, you HAVE to pay for the rice and naan separately, which is a total rip-off. Plus the lamb masala (#23 on menu) had only five tidbits of lamb.

(low key seriously think that these other reviews were written by the employees themselves.)< /Review>

They serve uncooked chicken . The food contains artificial colors and the owner is very rude and grumpy. This place survives only because there are no other Indian options. Never go to this place otherwise you will have  stomach upset for 2-3 days. Stay far far away from this place.</Review>

Service was terrible, took them 30min to get our drinks and served 4 tables before us.  We had to leave with takeout and the one of the tables had finished their food by the time we left.  They we're not busy and the manager on site served tables of only women much faster and like to flirt with them.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Good Indian fixed price buffet ($ 11 each, including naan bread, drinks not included). Good food but little spicy / spicy (personally I prefer it stronger). Friendly and very attentive service (they came back every 2 minutes to ask if they needed more free bread or drink refill)

(Original)
Buon buffet indiano a prezzo fisso (11 $ a testa, pane naan incluso, bevande escluse). Cibo buono ma poco speziato/piccante (personalmente lo preferisco più forte). Servizio gentile e molto attento (tornavano ogni 2 minuti a chiedere se serviva altro pane gratis o refill della bevanda)</text>< Pictures>

Má nová zkušenost s indickou kuchyni. Jídlo formou bufetu. Začal jsem opatrně ochutnáváním a pro třetí talíř jsem šel již najisto. Vše jsem dorazil dezertem,,  sladkou rýži s ananasem,,. Doporučuji!</review>

Great place to get your haircut and beard shaped. It was my first time getting my beard shapped and trimmed and the gentleman took his time to make sure it was perfect. Friendly and fun environment too. Definitely worth going to. Make sure to get an appointment in advance though.< /text>

I absolutely love this barber shop.  The atmosphere has a very modern cool vibe and the staff provide a very oldschool  hospitality vibe.  They are all very nice and greet you upon arrival.  I have brought my boys here since they first opened and will  continue to do so.  They keep my boys hair looking fly.< /text>

I've been a loyal customer for over 2 years and mostly with the same barber. While he and most of the staff have amazing skills and are very talented barbers, there is a lack of business etiquette, professionalism and customer service. Rarely have I checked in to my appointment ready to be served as previous appointments always run behind- often 15 mins and a couple times 30 mins behind.

The haircuts are great but it's no longer worth the frustrations or annoyances of dealing with the poor time management skills.< /Review>

Came in for a fade, one guy was busy with another customer the other barber didn’t seem to enthusiastic about quitting his solo pool game to cut my hair. That combined with the loud stereo & tv going was enough to decide it would be my first & last cut here. The place is more of a hangout than a professional barber shop. Been a while not sure if things have changed.</Text>

Not many authentic Mediterranean restaurants in greater Palm Springs area. This one is no frills but the food is good and fresh. Plenty of outdoor seating and lots of parking as it's in a larger shopping complex. Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood.< /review>

<text>I tried to order a group order for 10 people via Seamless and they cancelled my whole order because I asked that they separate out the pita due to a gluten allergy - then I called to resolve the issue (apparently they always separate it out...), and they had me resubmit the order. Then they cancelled the order again - why? Because they don’t take online delivery orders that big... they make you do call in to pick up takeout and they don’t deliver themselves.... I don’t understand why they wouldn’t take my money....<//text>< date>

One of the best Mediterranean restaurants I’ve been to and I’ve been to a lot. The people who served us (assuming they also own the place?) were so kind and the service was wonderful. The food was fresh, cooked upon order. Pita was on point! Will be back for sure!< /text>

We ordered take out and it was very good. We had the lamb & beef shawarma with French fries. The meal was delivered on time, looked great, however only one comment on the French fries. They would be so much better if you fried them to be a little bit more crisp either using the European method of frying them twice or at least letting them stay in the oil longer to crisp up. Otherwise the food is very good here and fresh.<//text>

<Text>This restaurant is the best in Indio, for my money. I'm not saying every experience is perfect every time. That's not my idea of realistic. I judge based on quality, consistency, service, ambience and convenience. By this standard, over time, and I've dined here on many occasions in a variety of contexts and for different purposes, Super Shawarma Mediterranean Grill deserves my five-star review.< /Text>< Response>

<Text>Rude to say they didn’t have my Uber eats pickup order. Plainly rude. Order #D3CEA
On Sunday (4/18) I walked in at around 1:20pm. I asked to pick up a Uber eats order.  The waitress said they have no Uber eats order.  I tried to show her it says ready to pick up on my phone.  She didn’t bother to look and said it was cancelled.   Rude. Worst attitude ever. I had to walk out and waiting on Uber support.  Ironically it remained ‘ready for pickup’ on my phone until at least 2pm and automatically completed it. So it thinks I picked up or whatever.<//Text>< GmapID>

Yes it's truly the Super Shawarma Mediterranean Grill in the Cathedral City, CA.  Better than Zachary's.  If you have a freind who disagrees, I'd challenge her to a blind taste-test.  Honest tongues prefer Little Star.< /text>

We decided to try out this Mediterranean joint over Sushi (we’re creatures of habit) and we absolutely loved it! The Chicken Shawarma was delicious. My four year old enjoyed her meal as well; great options for kids. I enjoyed the atmosphere and music. Service was great. Very polite and sharp. Will be coming back whenever in the area.<//Review>

Honestly never had deep dish pizza until this place, but after this place I am a fan and a believer. What is there not to like? Just get the normal popular ingredients of a pizza and INCREASE 5 TIMES!!!!!!!!</Review>

Great food! are Egyptian heritage and I'm used to Lebanese so the only thing I couldn't get was tabouli but the rest of the food was delicious. I ended up having excellent hummus and pita bread they also brought me out delicious rice and chicken shawarma yellow. I would highly recommend the falafel because it's freshly cooked, and you have to get The baklava for dessert. They call it goulesh but either way it's amazing<//text>

This place is the absolute BEST place to get Mediterranean/Greek in the valley. The gyro wrap is absolutely exquisite. Nothing else in the area can compare. The hummus and grape leaves are on point as well. The lentil soup was a nice bonus on a cold night. I’ll be a lifelong customer.<//Text>

Service is friendly but rather slow, still expanding their menu, but a tasty alternative to the more widely available Mexican or Chinese restaurants in the area. Given their slow service take-out might be a better option.<//Review>

I placed an order which was delivered promptly, however the order was incorrect.  No problem, I was promised a replacement order and, an hour later it still had not arrived and they were no longer answering their phone.  1 star -- not for the mistake, but for the lie about replacing the order that ended up causing a family to go 2 hours and have no delivery options as everything was now closed.

PS food delivered was not food that we could eat and was not picked up -- a very sad waste of food that had to be trashed :(  I will not order from them again.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1582751188241, 'text': 'We usually don’t respond to bad review because most of them was personal issue. Your issue is totally our fault and you are so honest of everything you wrote. You received a wrong order and your order wasn’t picked up yet. I talked to my server to be careful next time and make sure to give the right order to the right driver cuz it cost us money and lose customers. It seems she was doing it on purpose and she did the same thing with your Order. As matter of fact she gave your order to the driver that belong to a different company so we end up by firing her. We stop taking orders that night cuz I don’t have server as we told her to leave the restaurant right away. I spent more than four hours on the phone with Uber eat and Grubhub to notify them with our fault and make sure that all the customers get their money back and we are responsible for everything.\nI am explaining to you what happen even thought I understand that’s not your business. I am just trying to give excuses so you can give us a chance to make it up to you. So please contact us and we will do anything to win you back as a customer.

< Review>
This is my second visit. I was greeted immediately by a friendly man. I was asked if I was enrolled in rewards points. I signed up shortly after he took my order. He also showed me the specials. I had the chicken shawarma plate, and lentil soup it was delicious. I loved the decor, the server was an older gentlemen, very polite. Reasonably priced. I highly recommend this restaurant.

Muy buena comida, buenos precios, personal amable.</Review>

Unbelievable.  The first time I've been denied service with my Mobility Dog.  Mind you, I rely on him for balance, and as an engine wearing full leg braces on legs that don't function.  I couldn't believe it when I told him (as if he didn't know) that it was a Federal Law, a California Law, and common decency, he still refused.  If you have a disabled friend or family member, do them a solid and find a better restaraunt to eat at.</Review>

The best middle eastern food establishment we've been to in the Coachella valley thus far. Great food, affordable prices, and excellent service, the people and family that work there really take pride of what they do, and they do it very well. It's clean, cozy, and a breeze to park, easy location to find in Cathedral City.</Review>

called and showed up an hour before the place was supposed to close, and it was already closed. Obviously they cut out early and don't adhere to their business hours. Lost business<//Review>

<text>Im not sure if is the lack if traffic but the food didn't feel fresh, I wasn't able to even eat half a plate.

I was looking forward to go there but for sure will never go back.

Service was okay<//text>< GmapID>

Restaurant was out of food. We we're served the leftovers which didn't amount to the money we paid for it or how it was listed in the menu. A short time after we ordered the waitress came back and asked if it was ok to substitute an item from our meal because they ran out. How do u run out if rice? In the end, our meal was less than satisfying and the restaurant made no concessions for there short comings.</review>

Their falafel is dry and their falafel sandwiches do not taste good - there are so many better falafel sandwiches out there, unfortunately their's fell flat. The soup that came with the falafel was very good but that was about it.</Review>

Food was well prepared. Service was slow for the amount of customers. Total seemed high at the end of the evening. Did not notice that they had added French fries to the bill that we did not order . Pricey for the quality and amount.</text>

Food was freshly prepared but flavors were more dull and not as bright and complex as other styles of thus Middle Eastern cuisine. But reasonable so try for yourself .< /text>

<text>My mom and I decided to try this place based on the Yelp reviews.  We both decided to try the chicken and beef schwarma platter.  The food was very good especially the soup, meat and rice.  We like the babba gonush, hummus and tzaziki.  We shared a piece of baklava which was a little disappointing because it was tough. The service was attentive.  The place was a little slow for a Saturday evening.  I hope they advertise more because I would hate to see them close.</text>< pictures>

The service was outstanding however I didn't find the food to be quite as impressive as I was expecting. I think perhaps a better choice for Middle Eastern food would be some of the other restaurants in Cathedral City.<//Review>

The place looks nice. It has a nice bar with hard spirits and beer. Lots of tvs for watching sorts. Friendly staff. Food is typical bar and grill food. Nothing special. It's a good place to watch a game with friends.<//Text>

<text>First time visit... Great atmosphere to watch FSU Football. It was jam packed and anytime my beverage was low, they asked it I needed another one.

Killer wings too.

<Review>We decided to try the FH last night as we were both wanting burger type fare on a Friday night and as close as this place is to our house we had never been there. Walking up to the door there was a lively crowd in the patio at the front. Entering the establishment it impressed as being roomy with the bar and dining areas at opposite sides. The waiting staff was friendly. My wife ordered the tri-tip sandwich and I ordered the blue cheese, bacon burger, medium. The tri-tip was tasty, but tough. Similarly my burger was tasty, but dry.  When it arrived I wondered how I was going to take a bite from a 5" thick sandwich. My onion rings we good and my wife's fries were crispy. The mid rating is due to the high cost - at least $3 higher per sandwich than anywhere  else we've been in Fresno, and the lackluster punch of the food. Even with all the flat screens on the wall, the ambiance wasn't worth the premium prices.</Review>< Pics>

Great local sports pub. Relax and watch the event or grab some quick pub style food. Their salads look enticing also... But not as enticing as their black & blue burger.</text>

<review>Service was great! The bartender was attentive and super friendly. But the food was disgusting. I ordered the Cheese sreak sandwich. The meat was good, but the oil or butter that was on the bread was bad. Not as in it tastes bad, but as in rancid bad. It made the sandwich inedible. The sweet potato fries looked black. Probably old grease in the fryer. I told the server and she said she would talk to the kitchen manager. But there was no resolution at all. We received the bill, which was not adjusted, paid it and left to never return. Other than the disgusting food, the place is pretty good.< /review>< Gmap_id>

The place looks nice and I love the location.  It is very loud inside even when the place is half full.  Menu is very limited (there are no vegan options) but the prices are on par with most other places to eat in the area.<//text>

<review>Good food, moderate prices, and always very busy so the service is hit and miss.  I've been there 4 times.. 2 with good service, 2 with poor service.  With more consistent good service, I would give it 4 stars.< /review>< pics>

<Review>There was no social distancing procedure in place in the store. Customers were over each other in the checkout queue. Target does it really well where they have big round step stickers every 6 ft. And hm store had tiny red tapes that no one cared for and was hardly visible!!!!!! If any store is opening in this pandemic should assume social responsibility to make store shopping experience anxiety free for customers!!!!!!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I bought pairs of jeans for my son. The cashier lady didn’t take out the alarm button when we went out of the store, the alarm went on. We thought maybe the lady next to us. We went home let my son tried out the pants. Didn’t know there was a big needle inside the pant, my son got a big scratched on his leg.</review>

Didn't know I needed to bring in my handicap sticker to use the handicap dressing Room at this store. It was the only stall available and I asked to use it several times. There seems to be some miseducation about what the employees should and should not be saying or how they're treating individuals with obvious or not-so-obvious disabilities.<//Review>

< Review>
Really liked the banh mi and bun here. The cilantro lime shrimp was also a great twist on fries - ours were sweet potato. Portions are very filling, even when we split a lunch special (half sandwich half salad). Service is fast, there's outside seating, very close to the movie theater and nearby shopping. Definitely coming back here again when in the area.<//Review>

<Name>SaRice Freeman</Name><Text>I tried this place for the first time and was very satisfied. I had the Bun salad with chicken and the sparkling mint limeade. The salad has cold noodles in it and it’s very pleasing . I like all the dynamics of the salad and the chicken egg roll that tops it is so good I almost went back and got a separate order. The limeade is very refreshing although I think it is a little over priced it was a great combination with the salad. I also love the service of the staff here they are super friendly and nice and very helpful when it comes to a hungry person who can’t decide what to get like myself . I would definitely come back!< /Text><resp>None</resp><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7EsMWuZ1CZ0Jlf-vQf8fvauISWsHJeTJkq83A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< user>

Sawleaf in the marketplace completely solves my withdrawals for delicious Vietnamese food when I'm in Irvine :)

The location is very modern, clean, and super cute inside! They have really cool artwork and I love the layout of the store because it feels so open and bright all the time!

The service is amazing- everyone is really friendly and they always check up on their tables even though it's not a full service restaurant. Calvin, the owner, is seriously so passionate about the food and that shows through the quality and consistency. He really cares about his customers and that definitely translates to his staff as well.

I feel like I've tried most of the menu by now so I'll break it down:

Beef pho: the broth is amazing! It's super hearty and you honestly don't need any sauces because it's so flavorful on its own
I really appreciate the fact that there are separate broths for the beef, chicken, and vegetarian
The soy garlic tofu pho is also surprisingly Delicious even though I loveeeee meat

Spring rolls: so light and refreshing~ I also love the dipping sauce and it's great with sriracha

Egg roll bites: perfectly crispy and a great appetizer since they're so small and there's a lot a lot so it's easy to share

Banh mi: I love how the bread here is perfectly toasted so it's crunchy but also soft! It doesn't hurt your gums like some of the other banh mi places :) I've trade the lemongrass beef, chicken, and pork belly and they are all so good so I'd recommend Any of them!

Bun (vermicelli) and salad: this is my go to when I want something healthier feeling especially cause there's so many greens~

Loaded sweet potato fries: I prefer these with the shrimp :) it's another good appetizer and the sriracha aioli is bomb like always~

Sparkling mint limeade: my favorite drink here because it's super refreshing and light!

Vietnamese coffee: really creamy and smooth :) it's also sweet and strong just as it should be~

All in all, I love everything here and I'd recommend sawleaf to anyone because they have such a huge variety</Text>

Was hoping to get the tofu pho with vegetable broth, but they don't have veggie broth :( I thought they had it before. Maybe it was discontinued?! I settled for the tofu bahn mi sandwich, which was good. It comes with a side of sauteed jalapenos. Staff was very friendly. The bathroom could use a deep clean!<//Review>

Spent $10 on special Bun Mi all bread skimpy on the meat and nothing special. Better off getting the pick 2 special. Better Viet menu elsewhere and at a better value.<//Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>I had the bahn mi with garlic beef and a bowl of pho. The soup that came with the pho was luke warm and not impressionable. I wished they cut up the beef a bit more in the bahn mi because the chunks were huge and with each bite of the sandwich, most of the beef would come out and leave the bread with just cucumbers and pickled carrots.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz8BjNLnGDizqWA6UoL2SZVuo9C8Y-QSEfx-8w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoVO5P7MFmOsCXobWkScTBuatKqnTSe4bTFCE4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures></record>

I'm happy there's a Pho place near me, but Im not used to the price and portion.  Good food, love that they don't add MSG to their food.  I've been spoiled being brought up in family Pho restaurants, so paying $10 for pho with a small portion of beef in it was a shock to me.  Don't get me wrong, their food is good, but Ill have to get use to paying premium $ for being in Irvine instead of Little Saigon.  Their banh mi is pretty good, perfect amount of flavors and fresh veggies.  The bread isn't the traditional bread but it works (they panini press their sandwich).  I love their coffee which is made with Cafe du monde beans.</Text>

<text>I like that they have some vegan options. I usually get the Banh mi sandwich with tofu. Really good! They don't have an extensive menu for vegans but it is good for a quick bite. More like Vietnamese fast food but still good.</text>< username>

The food and service were ok.  The upsetting part is that the bowls show that they come with a spring roll so you think you will get it, but then you are told that it is not included, that it's extra. False advertisement!</text>

This restaurant was a solid find by me and my husband. We come here quite often. They are unique in their approach in serving Vietnamese food. Nice ambiance and clean and friendly service is more than most Vietnamese restaurants can offer.

We tried their pho and they've recently changed the way they serve pho. They have different types of broths! They have a "Hue" style broth that has lemongrass and chili overtones and a roasted garlic type. We tried both and it was great. The price is a little higher than what you would find in Westminster but hey, it's Irvine!<//text>

Really good americanized Vietnamese food. If you can't make it out to westminster or garden Grove then this is the location you could try hitting up. I did not realize that they had pho as well as banh mi and bun which is a Vietnamese noodle dish. Overall the prices were affordable and I ended up getting the chicken bun which was pretty delicious for the price. The sweet chili fish sauce was different that the fish sauce I am used to but it overall made it a very good tasting dish. Would be willing to try the pho to go next time but you can get that everywhere in garden Grove though so it might be a waste. I would recommend this if you are in the area and are craving Vietnamese food and need to eat right there and then. Also blk coffee next door is pretty good if you get their blk coffee and nothing else.<//Text>

This place has a unique approach to get Vietnamese food out there. It's located in the heart of the Irvine Market place and gives people who are unfamiliar with Vietnamese food a chance to try some.

It's fast casual and while im used to sit down restaurants, I feel like there is no real competitor out there in this segment. What I love the most here is the combo option. You can actually get Pho and Banh mi combo! It's a smaller portion but i thought that was unique.

I will be back!< /text>

I'm so happy they opened this one closer to home, and with an expanded menu! It's a little pricier than your average $5 bahn mi, yeah, but super high quality (and do you really expect $5 sammies in this shopping center?). The counterservice is quick & extremely cordial too. I'll be back often.<//Review>< Pics>

Veg pho! It actually tastes good too, unlike many other veg pho offerings at other restaurants. Really great service too, they're on their game. I'll be going back for sure.<//text>

I honestly only went here for their yelp check-in deal and yes, it was good but being in Irvine, I think place was really over priced for Vietnamese food since there are so many asian places in irvine for cheaper.

Their food is pretty good and if you are looking for a more "aesthetically pleasing" vietnamese place I would recommend Sawleaf but their pho tastes just as good as the pho so 1 on barranca and thats only $8< /Text>

Had to ask for a refund. Soup was room temperature the first time it came out. I asked for a new bowl, the worker apologized walked back and grabbed another bowl of pho which also had been sitting there for well over 5 minutes. Don't compromise on quality when it gets busy, customers will wait for good food.<//review>

<review>Pretty good place for a quick bite to eat. Ordered from the Pick Two menu, which is only $10 and you can choose from pho, bahn mi, or bun. They’re half portions, but enough to split for a lighter lunch. I really liked the beef bahn mi. And their sparkling mint limeade is so good! Pho is pretty decent, not as flavorful as more authentic restaurants<//review></record></dataset><record>

Yo, I came here the other night and their pho was amazing! I had a large filet mignon pho. The meat is super tender and the portion is actually quite bigger than I thought. Anyways, me and my friends are definitely coming back. Glad it's so close to my house.< /Text>

The pho isn't very good, but the bun and banh mi are solid.

Generally a better deal than the other food around it, but kind of pricey compared to what you'd find in Little Saigon.</Text>

<Text>I like the tofu with veggie broth pho here. It's not authentic pho, in my opinion, but it has a savory flavor. They do not include veggies in the pho like at other places, which makes it a lighter meal.  Today we ordered Saw Leaf via Postmates for delivery to our home.  It didn't take long to arrive, but there were no beansprouts, jalapeno, or lime.  We called the store to let them know and the young man that answered simply said he was sorry and he didn't know what the protocol is for this type of situation. It was disconcerting that the staff is not trained to handle these matters. 😟< /Text><Rate>3</Rate><userid>114348218991486000190</userid><time>1509842896601<//time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Casual pho, but not for the experienced pho eater.

I was excited that a new Vietnamese food place popped up in Irvine. Came to check out the Pho since my previous favorite pho place (Thuan Kieu) left Irvine.  I was immediately disappointed by the lack of choices on the menu. 3 kinds of pho, 3 kinds of banh mi, 1 bun....  Ok, I get it, it's not a Vietnamese restaurant at all; it's a cafe....  But choices are more limited than a food truck!

I ordered the Pho supreme. The brisket were in pieces, broken mostly.  The tai was all clumped together indicating that it was cooked in a strainer. I would have preferred my tai be laid out and cooked in the bowl by the hot broth.

The noodles were also packed too tightly, but cooked well. Broth is a bit light for my tastes (some may call it watery) and definitely not hot enough.

True to its name, they serve the culantro herb ("saw leaf") with the Pho. It's is a must have for a good pho experience 😉.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The weather was chili last Sun so the sound of pho broth seemed appropriate. We ordered the pork belly bahn mi which my 14yo son enjoyed.
Not a fan of any creamy sauces on sandwiches but then again everything tastes good to most teenagers boys esp!
Also had the premium beef pho. Eh. Thin broth. They claimed to concept on super fresh ingredients, well, the sprouts were brown, the 1 sawleaf was so tiny, 1 sprig of basil had maybe 4 leaves, & 2 slices of soft jalapeños. Not going back.
I know this is Irvine but I'm used to cheap vietnamese food pricings so I think I would rather drive to westminster & go to our usual beef pho joint, pho 79 (best soulful beef pho in cali)!!!<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It’s not good for nearby other pho restaurants. Vietnamese river flour is not strong enough, the color is not bright enough... Vietnamese bread is even more excessive, the beef minced is stinky, I don’t know how old it is! It’s too much! ! !

Scammers or simply Non professionals. We agreed for a 6 month SEO contract and half on the amount was transferred as requested. The website was crushed on very first day of the start.  We had to restore the website from backup but they CRASHED IT AGAIN on next day. On both occasion they denied any responsibility saying they did not even start the job login details were wrong. Nevertheless realizing something is wrong we decided to cancel this job and asked for a full refund. They responses was "refund will not be provided as it was you who cancelled the project". More than that despite originally stating they were not able to even login to WordPress, they now say "we did 3 month worth of SEO on your website" :(. Simply dishonest scammers!
No refund was provided up to this day. Emails and calls are ignored.<//Review>

<text>Thank you for developing our website. We like to compliment on the design , colour concepts and especially the logo.
The duration to have completed the website was remarkably fast.
I would like to thank Sharon (salesperson in charge) for reaching out to our business at the right time to increase our sales. She introduced a responsible person named Joe to create and work on our website. Joe has put in continuous effort with patience on explaining the process of the requirements. Sharon and Joe are highly recommended in their professional performance with humility.<//text>< Pics>

I am pleased with their work and would like refer this to my friend and relatives. This is one of the best website i ever had, after 3 companies and been very disappointed i can say that Shane did give me back all my confidence that was lost about trusting companies unknown. The service is quick, efficient and reliable.

Now i can say that Get Visible Web are part of my success and my company expansion. Amazing team to work with and they can give the top customers expectations.

<text>If you pay this company for anything and decide to switch services to a different company, please beware. I was to take over a website and after only a few weeks, the website no longer works due to a hosting error. I have tried to contact the old account rep and he will not reply to me. Now the client will likely have to pay for their website to be completely rebuilt.

Do NOT hire this company for anything.</text>< response>

My experience with Get Visible Web so far has been fantastic! From my first initial phone call and speaking with Floyd I have been impressed with the ongoing support he and Tom have shown me in managing my website and their dedication to getting my business to the first page of google as promised. Floyd has bent over backwards to help with any problems I might have had and Tom has done a great job managing my account as my account executive. Well done guys & Thankyou.</Review>

I would like thank Floyd and his team for designing my web page, the whole team has been very helpful to what I have requested.  They have been very professional in their approach and communication has been very good. Floyd and his teams input have helped me design a web site suitable to my painting and decorating business and have no hesitation in recommending their services.

After several dismal attempts from other SEO Companies, I was fortunate to receive a call from Bryan at Get Visible Web who explained exactly what I could expect from his company.

I am very happy with the work that both Bryan and Kate (Marketing Executive) have so far done for my website and business.

I am looking forward to a long standing relationship with all at Get Visible Web. Keep up the great work I am very happy with your efforts.

<Review>Get Visible Web and I have been in a very heavy working partnership for more than a year now. Needless they have been instrumental in promoting my business over the internet and I have been enjoying a steady flow of potential customers over the past year. Thanks, to their well planned marketing strategy that we are sailing high on the internet.  Moreover, the website that they had developed for my company has been of top class and I often get compliment for it from my friends and clients. We all know how tough finding an efficient online marketing company can be, but all I can say is that I got lucky, they have been a very strong point of support in promoting my business.
Get Visible Web has constantly been on my side with their innovative marketing idea. The best part of this company is that they are passionate about their work and it shows. Moreover the customer service team at Get Visible Web is a dream to work, ensuring a great end product and assured results and most importantly, in time. Thanks for the support and keep on the good work Team Get Visible Web.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I was looking to place my business on Google to see what it would generate in sales but didn't know who to talk too. Then out of the blue received an email from Get Visible Web,I decided to contact them by email and have a talk about my advertising on Google and am I glad I did. My contact at Get Visible was Andy Walker he helped me with everything and what he promised he did and more. Happy with Get Visible Web (very happy).Would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone who was looking for a provider to get them on Googles front page.< /Text><Time>1452678726798<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Most of the reviews on google for this company are purchased reviews. They will keep calling ever after you refuse them and ask them politely not to call you. Their agents would just not listen. They have pissed the hell out of me in the last 3 days. I mean 35 calls in last days days even after asking them not to call me so many times. So damn annoying!< /Review>

I have had nothing but trouble with them. They did make a beautiful website for me. HOWEVER, what was supposed to be a $199.00 website turned out to costing over $700. After the website, they start charging  you for monthly SEO updates. They also did not explain that after making the website I would have to pay for them to list me in my hometown.  I have my Domain with Go Daddy and I used to have my site through them as well. I made it clear I wanted to keep my website through Go Daddy and just have them build a simple one for me. They built it on their site so now I HAVE to pay them monthly to keep my website. They made it clear that they would take my site down if I did not pay them monthly.
THEN I would receive an email saying they are going to charge me. I did not authorize one of the charges. I called them 2 times and left messages and I responded to the email that I was not going to accept the charge of $100.00. Of course they send the charge through and are refusing to refund. They sent me a letter saying I had to send them in writing that I would not reject any charges with my bank or report them to the better business bureau. WAIT, IT GETS BETTER !! I received a call last week saying it was Get Visible and they understood I was unhappy with their services. They said they were with the refund department and they were going to refund me $800.00. I knew this could not be right. Then they said I had to go to my laptop or desktop and give them access to my system so they could put the refund in my account. I refused to do this. A friend of mine got scammed this was and the company took money from her account instead of refunding it. SO I REFUSED TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO MY SYSTEM. This just did not make sense. So now I am thinking about shutting down my account and going through Go Daddy and starting over as I still have my Domain with them. I am so annoyed. No one there speaks English either so there is a language barrier too. PLEASE CHECK OUT OTHER OPTIONS BEFORE USING THIS COMPANY.<//review>

They kept calling me for 8 months continuously. Finally I gave them my business, paid a deposit and then hardly ever heard from them after that. I had to chase them up for updates on my campaign. When I signed up they called me again to upset me to some other stuff but they never called me to update me on my performance.

When I saw I was not getting any service I decided to ask for a refund and even then I hardly ever heard from them. Once they have been paid then they don't care to deliver the service.

They are NOT BASED IN THE US. THEY ARE BASED IN INDIA. Because of time difference I always preferred to contact via email but they hardly ever replied. I am still waiting for my refund.<//Review>

Get Visible Web did an amazing job creating the website for my non-profit organization! Vineet at Get Visible Web assisted me with the process and he was super easy to work with. He was prompt, efficient, and I feel like I can depend on him and Get Visible Web for help with any questions. Vineet asked me what I wanted my website to look like, and the designers really listened to all the little details! I am truly happy with the website they created for me and would definitely recommend them to anyone building a website.< /text>

I've had extremely good experiences with Get Visible Web. They have helped handle my programming and search engine optimization needs extremely well. If it wasn't for them I would still be dragging and dropping/copying and pasting the Excel sheet that practically runs my business. They also designed an extremely cool, and modern looking website design for my business. I also purchased SEO from them, and sure enough my website is ranking in the top 10 spot on Google! yay!! Would highly recommend.</text>

After receiving a phone call from Mr Andy Walker and likening how he would do extensive work in getting me on the front page, I thought i would give it a go as my previous company did not live up to their word. Andy Walker and his team listened to me, I have had an increase in phone calls just when the work market around me seams to be slowing. So I'm happy .
I have just signed on for another stint with Andy Walker and hope his team can keep up the good work.
Cheers Damian.

I was looking to increase traffic to my website. When Abraham at Get Visible Web explained how SEO could give me the results I wanted, I was skeptical, but after 2 months I have seen a definite increase of traffic to my website. I am pleased with the results,  and their explanation of how things work in online advertising.</Review>

<Text>After trying two different web designer companies in 2013 and 2014, we were really disappointed.  Luckily  I received a phone call from Bryan (marketing Executive of Get Visible Web) who restored our loss of confidence in website designers.  His genuine and honest short presentation of the services and benefits offered by his company, lead us to hand the design of our web site to Get Visible Web without any fear.
Thanks Amy (Account Executive) for dealing with the job, your patient and understanding was great specially when dealing with small details as well as adding and removing information effectively.

Do not use Get Visible Web. It's a complete scam. They keep putting off giving my refund. Now they will not even return my phone calls. Sad, but I guess I have to learn the hard way to research the company's that I deal with better.< /Text>

I started engaging Get Visible to work on my site about a month ago. I work with Fraser and Amy. I must say they are very pro-active and very quick to respond whenever I have a query. One month has passed and I'm seeing results at the SEO level. I will recommend them if you need a reliable SEO management company.<//Review>

The worst company I have ever had to work with. I have had nothing but problems and stress in the 2 years I have worked with them. They offer to provide marketing which does not work, they buillt a website which was hacked 4 times due to the lack of security. I am fighting for a refund on my website hosting fee for 2017 as my website is still unusable and is hacked and they will not restore it., now they have taken our money We have now gone with a different company who are really proving to be professional, what a difference. Use Get Visible Web at your peril!</review>

You can never get hold of anyone one the support phone number and when you leave a message, well thats as far as you get. The emails you send to support all get read but for some reason never get responded too. So overall... Rather give your money away to a charty than to this company, at least you will see a positive result from it.<//Review>< pictures>

I can highly recommend Get Visible Web SEO. I can attest that in a world where I have spent alot of money on Web services, everyone of these services have let me down one after the other, but in the constant telemarketing calls that we all get I took a chance and finally got lucky. Both Amy and Dave have been amazing always available to talk to which is truly amazing and Amy has been so polite and patient with my needs and requirements. They seem to be the real deal...thankyou Get Visible Web for your continued support< /text>

Scammers!!!!!!!
Review written on 19/02/201

SCROLL DOWN PAST REVIEWS AS THIS COMPANY HAS TRIED TO COVER UP THE TRUE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!

Also see complaintsboard forum

Getvisibleweb ripped me off!! Almost $1,000 Australian Dollars. I am a landscape gardener and earn less than $40,000 AU per year before tax. They were extremely misleading from the beginning to the end. I am still in the process of trying to remove the website they created.
Just to name a few mistakes they made-

1.) When first contacted by Getvisibleweb, I was quoted a price and a for the initial website and also the SEO settings to gain first page positioning on google. They then tried to change/ increase the prices thinking that I would not notice.
2.) I was told initially that within 3-4 weeks my business would be on the first page of google. Then after the 4 weeks they said it would take 8 weeks, and this continued.
3.) I was asked to answer a list of business details that they would use for the website and SEO settings which I answered all in writing (email typed document) that also included the keyword settings that I knew prospective clients would type to find business's such as mine however, I received a phone call about 3-4 weeks later asking for the same details that they had already received, They told me there was a technical error and the information was lost.
3.) I specifically asked them to only use information and photo's from my previous free wix website as I knew what important information clients here in my region of Australia need to know however, they created a website full of misleading information that was not even relevant to my business including a photo of a guy hosing his roof with a normal garden hose which was suppose to indicate that I provide a pressure-cleaning service. Too many content mistakes to mention, the list goes on.
4.) In the document that I emailed including my business details, I had specified to not list my home address as I provide a mobile service only. My home address was on the website for months after I told them of this mistake. After each mistake, I was told 'We are very sorry and it will never happen again'. It kept happening. During our phone communication almost every time they asked me for information that I had already supplied them with in regards to my website preferences.
6.) How I think they really fooled me was that after almost 3 months of signing up they sent me a report of the keyword settings and the page my business was listed in on google. One set of two keyword was successful in getting my business to the 1st page however, it was not a keyword that any client would type to search for the services I provide. It was not one of the keywords I had specified in writing and it was obvious that the only reason my business was on the first page of google was because no-one else in their right mind would actually type these words in to look for business's such as mine.

This was when I decided to pull the plug as it was obvious Getvisible was not, and still is not providing a genuine service. I have asked repeatedly for a refund however, they told me that they have completed everything they said they would. How do people like this sleep at night? So upsetting and it has been stressful and damaging to my business! I have since done research and have read other stories in forums including one very unhappy customer explaining that this is a fraudulent company- which you can find at complaintsboard forum

Update: I posted the above review yesterday and just received a phone call from Getvisibleweb today:
Getvisible web called me today offering me a 50% refund if I take down this review.

I refused!!!!

I am now in the process of asking other business's who have used Getvisibleweb to tell their story. If you have been ripped-off by Getvisibleweb and have a similar experience to mine, please write you're review on this site. If we all make a stand, we can stop this from happening to others!!!!< /Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>BEWARE::: Spam Company and spam reviews... They are in Kolkata, India not in USA... I am a SEO specialist myself and was trying out this company. I paid them 3 month in advance and asked report after 2 months and that day they logged in to my site for the first time.. Giving me excuses about "offsite work", Offsite work will never take place before "Onsite work"... You can never get hold of anyone one the support phone number and when you leave a message no call backs. They were sending wrong rankings(Keywords were not ranking on the page they showed in the report) so you'll love your reports but you won't get any increase in the site visits. The emails you send to support all get read but for some reason never get responded too. Still it's your money you can give it to these people to waste. You won't get results for sure.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< review>
I have been dealing with Getvisibleweb for all my website and Google advertising for the last 6 months. In particular I have been talking to Floyd, who has been always helpful, clear on what he promises and loyal on delivering all what he said.
I have been getting calls from many companies to improve my website and Google listing. None of them delivered any of their promises. I had a lot of hassle and issues with those companies. Honestly, I thought that I will never go with any of the Google listing companies anymore, until I spoken with Mr. Floyd. He actually listed to me all what the particulars of their offer and I wrote them. I then asked for sometime to think about this offer.
Later on, I decided to give it the last chance. Fortunately, I hit the ten and was amazed that basically they started delivering what they promised.
Now, six months later, my business already tripled the amount of customers. I then decided to renew my contract with them further.

I would recommend Getvisibleweb to everyone, who is keen to increase his business and going on higher horizons. Be confident that if you speak to Floyd, then you know that you are in reliable hands and that he will take care of your business and distributing your advertising campaign that way you desire.

I was told that I need to change my rotors and break pads when I really don’t need to change.
So I went to some other place to verify if they have same diagnosis. They only asked to change breaks fluids .
I was quoted $ 900 where my work is done for $ 90 dollars.

Stay away from scam.</Review>

Been coming here for years! Firestone is honest, straightforward and usually has great deals on their website on everything related to car maintenance. They never oversell which is what keeps bringing me back. They keep you in the loop as your car gets worked on and are very responsive. I'd highly recommend bringing your car here.<//review>

This particular Firestone on mowry gave me a decent deal on tires but usually the alignment and the service is a little bit questionable when you ask for something you may not get something like I wanted my brakes and my suspension inspected and they really didn't check it at the time when I was buying new tires. The downtown Firestone usually does aba job at listening to you.<//text>

Don’t waste your time.
I dropped off my vehicle around 1 for flat tire repair and lady at the front desk said it will be ready at 5.
I received a call at 5 that they won’t be able to repair it so i told the lady to go ahead and replace it and I’ll pick it up at 6.
I went there before 6 and guess what they told me they couldn’t work on my vehicle because of wheel lock.
Basically they kept my vehicle for 5 hours and didn’t do anything.<//Text>

Where do I start?  I just went there for a brake job and it took roughly 3 hours. That's not even the bad part yet that's just normal stuff, When I come to pick up my car after I was told it was done I saw none of my car wheels were back on the car. It clearly wasn't finished yet and they called me back too early.  That's not really a problem, that just a small mistake and not the reason for the one star. My car was finally finished and I paid for it I went outside and I notice there was something wrong with my trunk handle on my Prius. I then notice that part of the plate that guards the hatchback handle has cracked!  I called the main manager over there to show him the crack and he was reacting like he wasn't sure it was done at his shop. I told him that crack was not there until I brought the car here.  He gave me a card and told me that the main manager of the whole store would call me the next day. The next day happen and I did not receive a call so I had to call down to the shop to talk to the main manager. Not only was there a crack in the plate that covers the handle but the whole handle and plate came off, hanging from one wire. The guy that worked on my car ripped the whole handle off of my trunk and didn't tell anybody and pretended like it didn't happen!  Also the very next day one of my lights on my dashboard that indicate that I have a low tire came on!  We're talking amateur hour here!!  I'm going down tomorrow to talk to the main manager and I hope I get this fixed.  Stear clear of this place!! So mad!!</text>

Fremont Fire stone 40861 Fremont blvd (Too Bad)

💯% Mechanic’s Fraud,

They don’t know a vehicle STRUCT part located,

Here is the Reason :
I gave my car for flat tire and some noise in front Tire. Repair flat tire & they wasn’t find the struct part not exists (Damage) .
They just Lift my car , open 4 tires kept for 3 hours and they charge $73.47 .
Day after I called back why still noise exists, they said they didn’t find the issue and dealer should know about that.

After I take to another local mechanic shop , he just open hood and told me strut was damaged.

These fire stone garage have large space with fraud mechanics exist inside.< /text>

Message to Indian Community:
Yahaan kabhi na jain!!
I made a appointment to see this particular shop to get alignment checked again ( the car was working perfectly). Car was working perfectly since I have a mechanic who takes care of my vehicle.
In a matter of few minutes leaving their premises a new problem developed and when I returned next day as to why things can go wrong out of blue .... I had to hear that take your work somewhere else, I don't like your line of questioning. With little choice I had to get part replaced and got a bill for $500.
I asked for the part that failed and they said they sent it to supplier to get lower price for me.
They know people are in bind and towing will cost extra on top of the repair and plus hassle of investigating ...customer want to get on their way. So people listen up. I do not recommend this particular business.
If you need oil change go to oil change only place, battery just go to battery place only, tire change go to a tire store and change place only. If you go to a shop that provide all range of service like this business, DON'T  EVEN STEP IN.
Please write comment, tell us how many of you went to this repair shop and ended up getting more problems.
PS: I called State Attorney office to get their customer list and investigate how many customer came in and got caught up with more problems at their shop.</Text>

Worst experience ever! We dropped our car Sunday evening and we were told that somebody will be in touch with us Monday morning. After calling 10-12 times, they finally picked up our call and kept on postponing till Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, they called and said they have identified the issue but they are not able to fix it. They charged us almost twice than what we were promised initially for the diagnosis. Their manager is very rude. Overall, it was a complete waste of time and money.<//Text>

<Text>This place used to be a 4 or 5 stars. Came in today and service has gone down hill. Rude staff is a turn off.  Even if I wanted to continue giving them business I wouldn't be able to bring myself to. In the past have recommended Firestone for their honest staff.  Now the attitude just blows.

Update:  Maybe it was just a bad day.   Upgrading from 2 stars back to 4.

Update 1/14/19:  Tried calling several times to get tires.  The phone rings for 3-5 minutes and then just hangs up.  Don't know if this place is still around.  This was during listed business hours.  Down to 2 stars since it's impossible to know if this place is still open and taking customers.</Text>< pics>

<Text>I take an appointment on Sunday around 1 pm for Tuesday 10 am. My wife went there for oil change and vehicle inspections coupons for 20.99 and 9.99. 1) The white guy (don't remember his name) doesn't honor the time and doesn't give a time of how long it might take.Mr.Patel steps in and upon persuasion, he says that they will take around two hours 2) Mr.Patel calls back in 1 hr saying there are many problems (but can be fixed later) and then calls back again in 20 mins saying there are some urgent issues to take care 2) My wife reaches around 12:10 pm and he says the tire has got a big nail in it near the valve and can't fix the tire. You need to buy a new tire and also the rear bulb near name plate is not working. This is a new good year tire bought around 4 months back 3) I get on a call with the white guy and not really have an option but to rotate the spare tire (charges $20) and also bulb ($23). 3) Gives me a laundry list of things that need to be fixed costing of $1269.
On top of that, the white guy is pretty rude to my wife. I just get the essentials fixed for which the bill is $75.
Never go here. They are cheaters and rude. I read a similar story here about nails in tires. See the pictures. Amazing job they did in putting the nails in the tires<//Text><Time>1519185629231</Time>< pics>

I dropped off my car for an oil change and asked them to give it a checkup. They pointed out 2 of the tires were going bald. I was able to get them replaced and a tune too (hadn't had 1in 2 years.

They didn't even verify tire pressure though tire pressure indicator on. when, I question about tire pressure inconsistent indicator. They says "You drive around, it will fix automatically. if not it could a different issue :(" It didn't go away though I finished 200 miles. When I verified, tire pressures... those are inconsistent. When they can't fix silly issue and try to say... It could be different issue.....! what should I say about their service ?? Quality of service is really poor & Expensive.<//Review>

I am from out of town, I got a nail in my tire too close to the edge to repair. I was at Fremont store first thing Sunday morning. The big guy told me it would be a 3 hour wait but the store Mawry, had only a 2 hour wait... so I went there. When I arrived at that location, they did not have my tire in stock so I went back to the Fremont store. When I was ready to pay for the tire (I was going to purchase the tire and go to Universal Tire to mount and balance) the big gal told me it was cash only. ??? WTHeck. So I asked ... so if I wait for three hours to install .... I can pay with credit card? But if I want to "just buy a tire I have to drive to an atm on my spare to get cash? But i was desperate so I did. It just did not make sense to me.
I could write a couple pages on the extremely poor service put to put it mildly, no accommodation for anything, very poor attitude and a poorly managed operation. It is sad .... by the way watch out the parking lot is littered with metal objects... bolts, brackets, screws etc.

Incompetent lying and rude crew. I have the life time wheel balancing for my car. I used to end up going here for oil changes to make use of it but they started claiming tires are too worn or have multiple nails and I should buy new tires. This happened twice over a three year period. I bought new tires each time. Both times they broke tpms sensors. Tire pressure sensors only update after driving a few miles. When I went back they ask for $120 just to diagnose and claim no responsibility. After the first time it happened I let it slide but obviously these guys don't know what they are doing. This time I had tpms sensors replaced from another shop. Ended up costing quite a bit extra each time. Don't plan to go back here again.<//Review>

Never ever trust their marketing team. The sales person lied to me. My front break pad was 6mm thickness. He said it is supposed to be 10mm. The brand new break pad is only 7mm in thickness. This was not causing the sound at all when I apply my break. But they fix that too. That was completely unnecessary. Some other review called them Liers and cheaters. That's completely true.<//review>

BEWARE TO THIS PLACE
i got my battery replaced and my car was stopping because the computer memory was reset. For this simple thing they charged me $200 just for inspection and gave me an estimate of $850 + plus taxes. I took my car to another nearby mechanic and he fixed for $100.< /review>

<Text>This was my first experience and it turned out to be really good. Staff is nice and courteous. They took time but gave me quality service. I have been ignoring other places like this and was using Walmart's Lube and Tire service at Automall in Fremont, CA. I was also ignoring the poor poor service from Walmart and bad customer support there. finally i got frustrated and decided to find a new place and found this one. Really impressed. Gosh should have come here earlier..</Text>< Time>

Worst customer service ever. I made appointment over the phone and reached on time . almost waited for 20 mins and guy on front didn’t even looked over and when I asked him how long is waiting he mentioned it can be 1:30 to 2 hr window.

<Text>Okay, Sunday morning I call in and ask about front end inspection for my 760 wagon (VOLVO) because Les Schwab told me from they're inspection my front end couldn't be fixed, so more or less this was a second opinion. I drive in and and let then do the inspection and they do a thorough job and tell me whats up with my car, I find I have a little play in my Tie rods. I do have wear in my tires outer rim from treacherous driving through the Altamont hills (How badly other people drive) and its pretty curvy up and down the hills. Anyhow they found me a decent set of tires but they didn't have it in stock, so i ask do i need to come back?, No they reply and order me a set from the other store. So they had someone deliver tires on Sunday so I can be done and drive safely again. I am so happy with they're service and treatment. I find by the end of this they waved the inspection fee and gave me a discount on the alignment service and waved the inspection fee. How much better can you get? I swear the Hook up isn't a word they do not understand, they emphasize it in they're services. A+ all the way, Highly recommend, just ask and things happen.</Text><username>Andrew Chevalier< /username>< user_id>

Horrible service. Sent my son home with a tire that was leaking air. Didn't stand behind warranty to repair tire. Service isn't at this store. Horrible experience. This store will be out of business soon. I would never recommend anybody going to firestone Fremont ever. If I could give negative start I would. There coffee even sucks.< /Text>

LIERS!!
Went for oil change and requested a tire rotation which was included with the tire package I bought from them earlier. I have different tires on front and rear and realized after coming home that NO tire rotation was done.

They lied to me and cheated me. This is not acceptable. I dont want to pay for  NO service!! CHEATERS</Review>

Service team had me wait in the parking lot for a auto inspection said they would be right with me.and it would be less then 1 hour  .. Then after 40 minutes of waiting the service manager states it will take over 3 hours since the team ignored us .  Poor customer service .<//text>

They are the best (change my mind). I've been coming here for almost a year maybe more and I've had no issues. Each and everyone of them can cut hair but ill be a little bias here because I've gone to this guy since I found this barber shop but  ask for Leslie.<//Review>

Guys did a great job on my hair cut. Wish I could have gotten in sooner but there is a long wait if you don't save a barbers number or call in to schedule your haircut.

Overall great experience!!</Text>

Very nice decor. Good group of guys. Not a walk-in and get a haircut (unless your lucky). I would suggest calling before hand and grabbing your barbers mobile for the best service!< /review>

Definitely a top-notch establishment with that rustic barber ambiance. James and Les were very warm and gracious people. I liked that there were appointments but I waited only about 15-minutes. Joe cut my hair and did amazing work! He was swift, but accurate and paid special attention to the fade and I left feeling great about his barbering skills. It is always a perk to be offered an ice-cold water or adult beverage while getting your haircut. Also, my wife and I were planning to eat in the area and Joe recommended an amazing place and texted me a discount flyer! Score!! They definitely went above and beyond with the service they offer here. I have finally found a local place to get my hair cut with confidence, style, and full barbering services! I think my hairs already growing back, or maybe I can’t wait to go back. Thanks again!!< /text>

So since I’ve been going to DJ for my cuts I get compliments ALL THE TIME!
DJ is excellent at his craft and also makes recommendations to help suit my personality and vibe.
I like my style to be really crisp but easy to maintain and DJ always comes through without a miss.
When DJ is away, I have had Sean and he is great too.
As a well traveled Marine, I can tell you that you will get a superb cut here with an environment built with the customer in mind.< /review>

THIS IS THE Best place for a cut!!! These guys are professional and super laid back. They know how a barbershop should be run for sure. Cuts run anywhere from $20-25 but are worth it when you go out and spend $100 on a night out. They have a great core group of guys and even have visiting barbers. Call ahead to make sure you get in and out with ease.< /Text>

Before chain barber shops would mess up his fade or cut his hair too short so I'm glad he's found a place to stick to. This place also has an awesome vibe and really cool experienced staff.

Stumbled here looking to get a cut, was probably the best experience I've ever had. Recommended it to all my buddy's at work and they all agree its one of the best. All the staff friendly, place styling, clean. Mens masterly, patient and price is right.</text>

my bro told me they rude if you aint a regular, so... do they want more regulars?? They just gonna be rude to every new person?? 🚨

Fade Factory opened up on Mira Mar , now I really wont be be recommending anyone here.

A barber at Fade Factory will literally drive out to give you a cut, theyre nice and dont mind new customers... I cant stand  “clique” vibes.

Respect ALL customers not just the ones you recognize. 🤷🏽‍♂️< /Review>

<response>None< /response><Text>After trying a few places on this side of the San Diego I couldn't find a place that could cut my sons hair as well as the place we used to go to in Chula Vista. The only reason I didn't give the Mecca a try earlier was because I'm used to walk-ins yeah sometimes u have to wait a couple hours but no appt was necessary. Anyhow after reading reviews I decided to give it a try. I made an appt with Ant and he did an amazing job on my son Preston. I'm so happy to have found a place right down the street from me that does a great job. They know how to cut and Ant did an excellent cut on my son. I will definitely be making another appt soon cause you really should make an appt a couple days ahead.

Unless you have an appointment expect to wait 30-45 minutes before someone even asks if you have an appointment or not. Barbers will disappear into the back for 15-20 minutes waiting for their next appointments while 2-3 "walks in" sit waiting for someone to cut hair. Higher than normal pricing not worth the wait.< /text>

OKAY... First time getting a haircut in the 858 area since I moved out here. I called the shop and I got my appointment locked-in. I asked for their price and then I actually started browsing different shops to match prices. Yes, some of them had $15 for a cut when Mecca quoted me over $20 for an appointment but I did more research. I browsed their instagrams, read some comments and reviews and I saw they were lower on the review numbers but had a cult following. Well, I took the chance and went right after work as I was running about five minutes late. My barber Jose actualy waited for me instead of taking some one else since I scheduled the appointment. Now I dont recommend being too late but they all have their personal number in case you need to let them know your running a little late. After settling down and a hair cut later my barber gave me exactly what I asked, old-fashion look with a hard part. I think I’ve found my new barber and I will soon be scheduling another appointment. Overal I had a great great experience: no waiting, No long line, great energy, no chopshop, No stabing hair cut. Just a great barber shop, excatly how it should be!<//Review>

I had a handcrafted brick oven pizza and a couple of cups of coffee with Bailey's and a salad called a chop chop.  The service was everything you could ask for!  Fast friendly and fun!  This will become one of my regular spots for sure to bring business clients and just a casual late evening meal.  Highly recommend!  - Joey<//review>< response>

Always love this place! Great service, awesome vibe and delicious food! I've come here a few times but highly recommend the 7's cheeseboard, truffle fries, and maybe even follow it up with some buffalo cauliflower! So good. They have a full bar as well as a fairly inventive cocktail list - they have an extensive list of authentic tequilas too! Won't be disappointed.</text>

There are a lot of great places to eat in this area, but I keep going back here. Great service, great food, we enjoyed some outdoor dining, and an actual happy hour that's got quality stuff on it. DEFINITELY go for the crab cakes and truffle fries.</review>

<Review>On The Thirty is a good restaurant for good quality food. Their brunch menu is good and their fully menu is even better. I had their crab cake with eggs for brunch. At first I was upset that it only came with one crab cake but it turned out to be ok. The potatoes, melon medley and the 2 eggs filled me up. Their Bloody Mary was mediocre though but their other drinks looked good. Make sure to leave room for dessert. Their beignets are pretty damn good.</Review>< time>

Great place! Staff and owner was very welcoming. Music and overall atmosphere felt great. Vegetable pizza was amazing and Moscow Mule is the best I ever tried in LA.
Definitely a must visit in Ventura Blvd!<//Review>

<review>Indoor and outdoor dining experience on Ventura Boulevard. A tasty experience with a variety of menu items, an extensive beer list and cocktails. I had a perfect Old Fashioned that is now craveable and a flaky Maryland Crabcake. We also enjoyed the Shrimp Spinach Salad (spicy shrimp), the Ahi Tuna Tartare and a Margarita Pizza.

The service was spot on. We were checked on regularly, food came out hot and fast, left over dishes removed quickly.

During Covid they asked for 90 minutes at the table. Tonight must have been an exception with the playoff game on a roll away tv outside, this request was not enforced.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIKjtO92nVd_CkmSNcMUASEzCB9BACkyPa68K5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOur_u__O3y_0199bWfIiGdzYekspJTDc44zog3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7s9vEMFXgctF12xo_2SdYHdcegz5LmRej9o_N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHqHe9SY-_5RFzZ8bR1xLISVwsGtbknHTGpnnr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c297c57824dfff:0x905f216b3f315606< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Poor quality of service.
It appears that when gratuity is already included in the bill, there is no need to make customers comfortable and take proper care of the table.
We didn't have utensils while our meals were already cooling down on the table. Around 10 minutes, we could not catch Jenny (our waitress) and ask for forks. Then, during the evening, she twice took unfinished drinks from the table without asking. Later on, we could not find Jenny again, and after 15 minutes of waiting, we were forced to order a drink from a busser (who was very nice, by the way).
As even basic services weren't provided fully, we decided to leave 15% tips instead of 20%, and we asked to call a manager. At that moment Jenny said that she is a manager and became extremely rude. Manager Jenny yelled at us and argued unacceptably that her service was excellent. She insulted us in increased voice with assumptions that we do not live in America and will leave her "a penny." Moreover, she NEVER APOLOGIZED for any of the above inconveniences.
After terrible arguing and insults, Jenny threw the bill at the table and said she does not need any tips. She added we are not welcome at the restaurant anymore.
It was the first time in my life when I did not leave tips.
Friday night was completely ruined.
Do not recommend this place.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c297c57824dfff:0x905f216b3f315606</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Good atmosphere, food was hearty and delicious. Drinks were stiff and made well.  It was Friday around lunch time so not too busy but I'm sure it's busy on the weekends.  I'll be back during that time to update my review.  Seating both inside and outside.  Air conditioning but not super cold.   Bathrooms are fully stocked and clean.  Lots of bar seating.   Great place for apps and drinks. Laura was my waitress she was awesome.<//Review>

<Review>My new favorite spot in Sherman Oaks!

Restaurant has an amazing selection of drinks and food. Gluten-Free & Dairy-Free friendly.

The vibe is great and the staff is phenomenal. We went near closing and they were diligently cleaning. Still friendly even though we were there towards the end of the night. Our bartender bought us a drink for Fourth of July. Will definitely be going back!

Highly recommend.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I would give this place 5 stars based on those items,  but their sandwiches and entrees are fairly uninspired and don't match up to the taste level of the rest of the menu.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>The food at On The Thirty is fantastic. The Cheesesteak sandwich, sweet potato fries, and blackened shrimp spinach salad were the standout of our meal. The outdoor atmosphere includes music and television screens that make you forget everyone is outside due to Covid. The only downside it that the service could be better. The restaurant is so busy that our server forgot to bring requested items more than once. Our server was definitely really friendly and you could tell that she was working hard. I will definitely return.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Delicious food with good-quality ingredients, comfortable inside, friendly, honest, and straightforward service.  We started with 2 drinks, The White Lotus and The Fire & Sand.  My Fire & Sand was one of the most delicious scotch cocktails I've had so far followed up by a glass of Ardbeg on a gentleman's cube.  We selected a variety of items on the menu, with all of them delivering on satisfaction.  The filet mignon, beet salad, Kobe meatballs, mac & cheese, and coconut shrimp spring rolls, with red velvet fried oreos to-go.
A great liquor and drink selection as well as on tap beer.  Fries were a little overdone and brown and the coconut shrimp should be more clearly stated as spring rolls and not so exciting, but everything else was superb.  Will definitely be back.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-kVz48NIqtWPnv9qKkVcRlKLN_iep2naSOB7i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIt7ztUdKe-PpXjYvPq6wzc0HWo3RgEk1PM0U0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXbkki8gpvPUw-wbqfJt1Kjq0SUZvfw78LPQQC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBfUY3TNyMMPuO6H_YeTjzLTeLBHnH-IVk3kFm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c297c57824dfff:0x905f216b3f315606<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN THE VALLEY

The food here is always good. I think they have dinner of the best pizza I've ever had!

Full bar. Solid happy hour (Monday $1 oysters after 6pm doesn't suck). Tons of TV's that are easy to see making this a great place to catch a game.

Validated parking if you park in the back lot behind the restaurant.</review>

I went here for happy hour. The brussel sprouts were delicious, the pizza could have been crisper (it was soggy in the middle), the fried oreos (pictured) were a guilty pleasure and the service was friendly. I will dine here again.< /review>

My favorite restaurant in the valley! Food is good we had the salmon today for the first time but wasn’t anything to brag about, I’ll stick to their sides and pizzas and of course their amaze balls! We had their sesame and the chimichurri salmon this time.< /Text>

I admire this place! They offer first-rate meals, their menu is decent, The chief cook in that place is a real pro, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The food is always good, the attitude towards the visitors  is efficient. I  go often to this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it to all my friends.<//Review>

The place is ok I like that is casual. The food is good but not outstanding. I was a bit surprised that they add a 20% gratuity in your bill I am ok with that since I know that some people are cheap and don't like to tip.< /review>

The food was great the ambiance was very modern laid back fun. The food came fast and so did drinks the only issue was our server. We came in Saturday night and sat at a table across the bar. I saw her when we first walked in talking to host then after a long wait she was the one serving our table. We ordered drinks she was knowledgeable of what was in them but she was not attentive. For the price of menu items I would expect the service to be better rather than just have an ordertaker. She didn't follow up after we got our food and we had to keep asking other people for our server and we also prebussed our own table because she wasn't taking our empty plates away. The people next to us were complaining about her service as well. I will be giving this place another try though. My friend got the garlic infused steak that is not pictured because it got eaten so.quick haha</review>

Love both the food and the staff. Drinks can take little long when the place get super busy as there is only one large bar here with two bartenders on duty. A great spot for a date nite or a party. Plenty of TVs for watching sports.</text>

Really good food and okay drinks. However, it is extremely loud inside so if you plan on talking in any sense of the word then go somewhere else. The hostess Ana was very nice and accommodating. She had great recommendations for my entire meal.< /Text>

Reason for visiting: birthday dinner
Date/time of visit: Saturday night, around 8:00 PM
Parking: on the street or the adjacent plaza behind the restaurant
Party size: 6
Environment/ambience: fun but loud. TVs everywhere so it's a good place for a game. Restroom is relatively clean too. There was a 30 minute wait for a table so we went to the bar where we ordered drinks and oysters.
Service: bar was slow initially. We waited about 10 minutes before the bartender came by. After she came by, she was pretty good. Service at the table was good.
Food: was good; had the burger with truffle fries. The oysters were good too, tasted fresh. Also had an Old Fashioned with Bulleit bourbon, which was good.
Cost: expensive but worth it. Came out to about $120/person.<//Text>

< Review>
This is actually one of my favorite places to eat. I’ve been here for a dinner date, my birthday dinner, and one of my close friends had her bridal shower brunch here. Place itself is very nice. The food is good. I am always very satisfied. I recommend this restaurant to everyone.</Review>

The vibe here is excellent. The servers are always super friendly and mess around with you and the food is phenomenal. The pizza, any pizza, is amazing. Also highly recommend the amaze balls, they're amazeballs. And no meal is complete without dessert, deep fried red velvet Oreos with vanilla ice cream have your back here. Complete with full bar and good beer, one of the coolest places to go in the local area, if a bit pricey for a daily escapade.< /Text>

<review>Wasn’t expecting it when before got here, but was happy to learn they make delicious pizza here. Delicious in a way that I am planning to return here.
Place is nice, big, and perfect for sport watching. When it is followed by good drinks and good food, what else can you ask for? Just a readable pricing.

I think my time here was dampened by two  things:
1. The majority of the seating is on high chairs.  I hate high chairs. I'm super short and these have always been uncomfortable for me.
2. The table right next to us included two families where the adults didn't give AF about what the kids were doing.  One of the kids would pick up a fry and throw it on the ground.  Would grab a handful of noodles an throw them on the ground.  By the time they left the entire ground and that side of the table were covered in food.  Not cool people.

That said - the food was good.
I got a steak and shockingly (I say this because this isn't a steak place) it was very well good and very well seasoned.  I've gone to steak places that weren't as good as this one which is why I was so surprised.
My husband got a pork sandwich that tasted excellent (I snuck a bit of the pork)

I would go again probably - but really the chairs are an issue for me so it's not going to be soon on my list.< /text>

It is really hard to do everything well but this place does it... They have excellent brunch and dinner food, cocktails, beer selection, food for a wide variety of appetizers (oysters to mac n cheese to charcuterie plate) for all sorts of tastes, outdoor seating, and even TVs for those who wanna keep tabs on the game. It's a great place for first dates. The ambiance is lively but the light is dim and the setting is cozy. I have been here at least 4 times. They also have an excellent selection for brunch and your choice of bottomless mimosas or sangria. They have a pizza with a cracked egg, excellent choice of appetizers. Service has been hit or miss. The hosts always seem to be on it but the waiters are not reliably excellent. I doesn't change my opinion. This place rocks. A staple for any event or just an escape if you are in the SF valley.  Happy hour is Sunday thru Thursday and I think it's 4pm - 6pm. I can't wait to go back.<//Text>

I found the menu to be a bit odd, the majority of it was pizza and essentially appetizer with there being a small section for high end entrees and I believe hand cut sandwiches with a single burger.< /review>

I’ve been a fan of On The Thirty for a long time. They have a wide selection of great beer and the food is amazing! The waitstaff has always been very friendly and helpful. I always get the prosciutto pizza. I love how they use truffle oil in truffle salt on most of their food! the only negative thing about this place is it is a bit on the pricey side. Usually for prices like this for what you get I would deduct a star and give it four stars… But the fact that I literally dream about their prosciutto pizza is deserving of keeping that star and getting a five star review. I would absolutely make this one of your must stop restaurants if passing through the valley. It’s a great place to meet up with friends.</review>

Why only two servers during big games? While they hustled, service was super slow. Drinks and food are tasty!</review>

Amazing food and cocktails! They have a great happy hour and the pizzas are much larger than expected for the price.</text>

Had Bolognese and it was beyond expectation. My party enjoyed there food too, though my dish was the star of the table. Unfortunately, their drinks were disappointing. Their mimosas have cheap champagne. Another popular drink is forgettable in name, but not in aftertaste.</text>

<Text>On the Thirty bar has amazing atmosphere and great variety of food selection. Service was great. Staff are friendly and competent. Prices are relatively affordable and competitive to similar bars along Ventura blvd. A great bar to meet and hangout with friends/a date over wine or beer. Street parking is available. I highly recommend On The Thirty bar if you're in Sherman Oaks area.< /Text>< GmapID>

Place is great specially the outside tables, Ventura is not too busy and the shade is perfect. Whether you sit on the bar or in a table service is quite fast. Oysters were surprisingly fresh and came with 4-5 differet toppings. Chicken skewers came 3 so if you share I suggest ordering another dish. Food was good but unfortunately every drink I ordered came absolutely wrong.  Martinis were not shaken or stirred I had many ice chips and way too much olive juice... and the most disappointing one was the bloody mary. It was 50% water and 50% horseradish.  I love the venue and the crowd that comes here is fantastic and nice. But drinks were not good. Thanks for a nice Sunday tho!<//Text>

The bartender was clearly far more interested in others at the bar, because he practically threw menus at us and didn't greet us or make eye contact. It also took a good 10 minutes before we even had our drink order taken. It was also ridiculously hard to ask for anything else once we placed our order, so we ended up asking one of the bar-backs and he got us waters and eventually brought us our bill too. Definitely should work on their service at the bar.</Review>

Staff was nice. Food not so great. Good fries. I had the salmon, it was a little on the dry side, and lacked flavor. Brussels sprouts appetizer was good, just needed a little salt. Good side salad. Over cool place, ok food.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>This is a hip and sophisticated bar/restaurant located in the heart of Sherman Oaks. Great date place for first dates and we got a sitter for the kids dates. They have a drink called the VIP which is a pineapple infused vodka that you drink out of a martini glass. They soak the pineapple in vodka 24 hours before serving. If you like pineapple and vodka, this is a must have. I am especially fond of the veggie pizza and during happy hour their pizza's are half price!!! (One pizza is big enough for two) Other food items my friends and I have loved are the lobster roll, the steak sandwich, the sweet potato fries, and the roasted beet and walnut salad. Go here and take all your friends with you. The vibe is great and its an awesome place to go every night of the week, with your friends, with your family, or even alone if you just want to get a drink or some dinner and be alone.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Service can be hit or miss. Food is really good, drinks are solid as well (ask for the off the menu bacon bloody). There’s a strange chemical smell inside (pine sol maybe). Over all chill place good for watching sports too.

Update: DOWN HILL....

I don’t know what happened but the food has gone from decent to bleh. The bacon bloodies used to be a reason to visit but no they’re watered down and they charge you double for the bacon for the difficult task of setting them in your drinks. No more smoked meats for the poutine.

Used to be decent, now stay away! Unless you like spending a $100 on a bunch of very subpar food and an absolutely terrible Bloody Mary. Bummer. RIP On The Thirty.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Super edgy, chic, sophisticated.

The small plates can get sort of pricey but they have decent sized and prices salads, sandwiches and pizza. I got the Kale

They have Happy Hour Monday-Thursday from 4:30-6pm that features half off on Pizzas and $5 beers and wines.

If you are ordering off HH then the bill really starts to stack.

Great ambiance tho and tasty wine!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Total let down! I've wanted to try this place for so long. Ordered the truffle fries and spicy cauliflower. Completely underseasoned for the price. I was expecting high quality, luxurious food but, I didn't even get a taste of truffle in my fries. I got one at the bottom that finally had a tarde of truffle, one!  And the cauliflower had zero flavor. It was just pieces of deep fried cauliflower without any spice. Completely underwhelmed. If you want something good, go to Bellwether!< /Text>

***EDIT———

Good food. GREAT Staff.

But now, as we are into what we are calling our “New Normal”, as hard as the management is trying, it still isn’t quite there...
There isn’t enough attention paid to the mask mandate.
People walk through the outside area, from the back parking without their masks on, and proceed to walk up to the Hostess without their mask.
Also, there is a makeshift fence along side the outer area, that borders the sidewalk, there should be plexiglass on top of these fences. Saw SO MANY people walking down the sidewalk without masks...
And smokers just stand on the sidewalk smoking, near all the diners outside.
I feel that there needs to be stricter regulations on where people can now smoke.
ALSO; the servers should tell the customers that gratuity is automatically added.
That came as a huge surprise.</Text>

<Review>Asked for a drink twice.  Bartender forgot the drink even the second time and came to ask me again.
Asked for the check twice, bartender was still unmoved.  Eventually paid, still waiting for change.

This Is why it matters.  If you are the owner I was hear for the night...... left after one $6.45 drink.

So check came, change was wrong.  Surprise ... no.
Made a call met my customer at Q sushi in Thousand Oaks, not really what we were looking for but the evening was great, server great, attention great.  We spent $230 which I would have been happy to spend at on the thirty but there you go.< /Review>< Pics>

Who says you can't have pizza for breakfast!? We went for the brunch special and it was great. Breakfast pizza and bottomless mimosas? Already worth it right there. We had a big group of ~15 people seated outside and when it started to rain, they promptly moved us to a table inside that accommodated everyone.  Service could be a little better, but the food and drinks are what you come here for.</Review>

This place is usually on point but the service took a nose dive this last time.

After getting seated it took 10 minutes before the server came over and greeted us. I guess the benefit of that was that we had more than enough time to read the menu but no way in hell we were going to order anything beyond dinner for fear of not knowing when we would ever see our server again.

It took about 30-40 minutes for the food to arrive which is pretty excessive for some burgers in my opinion. Five minutes after our food arrived the server came to check on us but at this point, we didn't need her help because we decided to go walk up to the host and bussers to ask them for additional items like red pepper flakes and extra ketchup.

Fortunately, the food was good but seeing your server twice over 50-60 minutes is simply horrible service.

I'll go back because I am local, but it will be long time before I do.</Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><rating>5<//rating><text>We ordered a ton of food, all of which was delicious - street corn, buffalo cauliflower, sweet potato fries (3 orders, they were that good!), pear & prosciutto, beet salad with burrata, a goat cheese salad, 2 different kinds of pizza, coconut shrimp, chimichurri chicken skewers, bacon wrapped dates, salmon. Everything was delicious. I had a fantastic Richmond gimlet and some sort of fresh blackberry and mint drink with rye. I heard the service can be on the slow side, but that wasn't a problem at all tonight. Great service. Got everything correctly and quickly. I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes like their charcuterie or a burger. I'm super impressed!< /text>< date>

Came in for my younger sister's college graduation lunch and she and a girlfriend got bottomless mimosas. Cut them off after 4 mimosas and then only gave them the option of water. Mind you this is a family affair with parents and aunts and uncles and the girls were being respectful and not appearing sloppy or drunk. We were enjoying ourselves but this really ruined our experience. We spent over $300 and this is how our graduate got treated and how we will remember our special occasion for her.

They should not advertise "bottomless mimosas" when it is not in fact bottomless. This is the whole reason why we came here in the first place. Call it "4 weak mimosas for $15".<//Review>< username>

I got the crab cakes appetizer and a side of sweet potato fries, bottomless mimosa too.  It was good. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because we had to remind the waitress multiple times for things.<//review>

I love this place. The space has always been jinked. I've been living in Sherman Oaks for ten years and I believe that space has been 3-4 different restaurants. I think "On the Thirty" changed that.  Their menu is delicious with lots of variety, they have live music which I love, sports on TV (which I don't love so much but others do). :)  The vibe here is great, servers are nice, and the patrons I've met there are very cool.  An establishment like this was much needed in Sherman Oaks.< /review>

<Review>A nice, upscale joint to have a few drinks, grab some better than average bar food and catch a game.  Big screens are plenty as is the selection of drinks.  Whiskeys, beers...don't know if they have anything else, cause that's all I need. Waitresses are nice and the place is well staffed.  There's an outdoor seating area if you want to get away from the noise on gameday.  This is still the first place I think of when asked where are we gonna watch the game.</Review>< Date>

No one is going to celebrate a birthday at your restaurant  that does that which means less big parties. That's just cheap on your end.

This is the first time I have ever taken the time to write a review. I sat at the bar for probably 10-15 minutes before a bartender thought to ask if I wanted a drink. When my friend arrived, the same thing happened to him. The place was not crowded at all. We actually laughed about it because the whole place has a pretentious vibe about it; like they are doing you a favor by helping you out with your order. We stopped at one drink and went somewhere else for dinner.<//Text>

My friend and I kept passing by On The Thirty and finally decided to give it a try. We came in on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't too busy. There were a good amount of people seated outside on the patio but we were seated inside quick enough.

The bar is the length of the room and all of the tables are high tops with very comfortable seating, perfect to sink into after having a few drinks  We ordered from the mixology menu a On the mojito, blackberry smash, and I had the pina picante (pictured). Everybody was very satisfied with their drinks and they were quite strong, enough that my friend had to swap her drink with our other friend. The pina picante has the perfect amount of heat, and I love anything quite spicy.

For food, my friends had the bacon-wrapped dates (A according to them but there's only four and they're small, so pricey in the end), the Montreal poutine (again A - the portion was plenty and the cheese curds melt perfectly), and the mac and cheese, which looked and apparently was delectable but again small and seemed pricey for the amount (though they do use local ingredients as much as possible!). I just went with the truffle fries, which seemed mediocre but the chipotle dipping sauce made up for that.

I would come back for the drinks - the beer menu looked amazing as well - but pass on the appetizers/food unless I'm celebrating a special occasion.< /Review>

I have been coming here since the world cup started but today being on a Sunday, one of the guys who is usually at the bar actually told us 'it was better if we left" because we were using two tables for our party, when the place was pretty empty at 11am.< /review>

<Text>I can appreciate the effort of On the Thirty and also the selection of strictly California craft beer on tap.

This definitely has a wine and upscale sports bar feel to it rather than a gastropub. The vibe here is definitely not trendy and caters to an older Valley crowd.

The hosts outside were not too friendly during my second visit. We wanted to sit at a table and they said "oh, that's for groups of four."  Later on, I saw a couple sit at that table.

The food selection or how the food is presented on the menu is not too exciting to me.  It feels overpriced for what it is.

I personally prefer the gastropub vibe at Local Peasant over On the Thirty. The staff seem to be more passionate, better trained, professional, and knowledgeable.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>I've celebrated many birthdays here and casual dinners it is very nice and pleasant experience they have amazing drinks good prices an awesome atmosphere and occasionally you'll spot a celebrity. However, I asked the bartender for an old fashioned with Japanese whiskey and I wanted hibiki but they didn't have it so he told me he has something else that a Japanese whiskey and I said ok. But when it came to billing me. He told me "oh hey, I'm sorry I didn't realize that this liquor is $55 so I won't upcharge you on making the old fashioned." I usually spend about $20 on my old fashion but paying $60 for one drink was a little ridiculous but I left it as an honest mistake. 😅< /Review></record>

I've only been here a couple times it's a decent place to meet date or friends for drinks or food, they've got some really good bar food and the drinks are pretty good. I don't know if I could be a regular here but every now and then it's okay, parking behind the place or street parking which can be limited.</Text>

Food is consistently good, server girls are sweet, sometimes there's a small wait, but you can call in your order. If you don't go there to eat, at least go for the beer and wine selection, that's where this little gem shines the most =)</review>
