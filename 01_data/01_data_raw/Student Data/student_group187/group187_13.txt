I frequent this convenience store, because it is the closest store that sells snacks, beer, drinks, etc. However, service quality has recently plummeted. I stopped by and bought a scratch-off lottery ticket, and I happen to win. Being excited about a semi-decent win for $100( on a $20 ticket), I returned to cash in the ticket the next day. I was turned away because they said they didn't have enough cash in the register. I understood the first day, and returned again the second day to find the same thing. Finally, the third day I bring the ticket in and even make a sizeable purchase for nearly $50, when I didn't plan on making a purchase at all. But, I figured it would help bring down the "cash back" amount. The middle-aged woman, who could hardly speak proper English proceeds to get upset because I was trying to cash the very lottery ticket I bought from that location. I explain that if you cannot cash out scratch-off lottery tickets, then you shouldn't sell them. She proceeds to get angry and tells me I have to pay for everything out of pocket. I told her the only reason I got this much to begin with was to help lower the funds she needed to return to me. Reluctantly, she throws a fit and clicked a few buttons on the cash register, which made the safe dispense the cash needed. SO, YOU MEAN TO TELL ME FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS, ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS PRESS THREE BUTTONS! There is no excuse. THIS IS LAZINESS. Yes, there are a couple employees here that I have great respect for and they are extremely helpful. This was a horrible experience though, especially when I came back three separate times...</Text>

This place is closest to my home so I have had to use it a half dozen times and every time I leave angry and fustrated. The pump doesn't connect properly so it shuts off or it freezes on "waiting for cashier" or it automatically says thanks for your purchase 10 times before help arrives and says it's a vapor lock issue with the pump please move to another. Save yourself time go to a different station< /text>

Often the program will jump back to the start menu and force one to start over again for no apparent reason. Sometimes it wont respond to button presses, then after a long pause flicker between several screens. This is all while lines of cars form at a gas station that is already always very very busy. These things desperately need to be replaced.  Until this is resolved I will take my business to Chevron over on 17561 MacArthur Blvd.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dcde805540b787:0x23c0f0d53d104546</gmap_id></record>

No thrills gas station in Irvine. I prefer Shell gas and this is one of the only ones in the area. It can be very busy during rush hour so I'd recommend getting gas outside of those hours.</text>

<review>The most frustrating gas station I have ever experienced in my life. The gas station is ALWAYS busy but only because of its convenient location, not the service it offers. The frequency of Out of Service pumps is outrageous. One should never expect to get gas at the first pump and instead play an infuriating game of pump roulette with the other patrons who are equally as frustrated. Half the time the broken pumps aren’t even labeled as such so you get excited to finally not have to wait in a long line to find out through trial and error that the pump doesn’t work. If you inform the inside staff they will just have you pay at the register and then never put up a sign for future patrons at the pump. At this point I dont know why they don’t have half a dozen laminated Out of Service signs at the ready. They should have diverted their money from the remodel to fixing their pumps.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

Buttons on some pumps don't work. Also the gas pumps slow, a tell tale sign the owner doesn't change out the filters. As for the cashiers, the day they are average and below. The night crew is a mess. Long waits to check out, have trouble ringing items up and they speak little English.<//Review>

< review>
Wow, between the beautiful view, the wonderful and attentive service, and the delicious food, I'm thoroughly impressed with Chinatown restaurant. The man who I assume is the owner was so kind and even brought me an apple for good luck as I was leaving and thanked me for coming in and giving him some work to do.

In Chinatown, it can be difficult to choose a place to eat, you would be making a great decision to eat here. I tried to tip 40% but the owner gave me back some change and said he would just prefer I come back to eat here again, which i will be doing tomorrow because it is that good.<//review>

This place is horrible! They added the tip in and would not remove it I feel like we have the right to decided how much they added 33% tip (31.75) to our total. The food was average and the prices per plate are $20 & up. Dishonest people stay away !</Text>

< Review>
This restaurant has been here since 1919 and this alone makde this visit interesting. But due to Covid, I got to sit outside on their fire escape. Now how many diners since 1919 got to do that? I'd bet not many. Food was decent but they clearly had a different menu for the Chinese and I'd really wish I had a chance to order from there.</Review>

Tried sitting us up stairs while ushering us in, staring at my husband pushing a wheelchair. Seriously? Sat in a ground level room next to the kitchen.Room sooooo cold,  just blah. Happened to sit next to a portable floor heater that we plugged in,it helped the 2 people next to it only. I thought restaurants needed to use commercial appliances but this place had regular refrigerators. Wayyyyyy over priced for mediocre food. We were hungry, my kid wanted dim sum and I needed to use a bathroom. Needs updating, yes has been there since 1919, cool. But meh. Bathroom was old but clean, nothing like a previous poster photo. With the added tip they should redo the bathroom. I was shocked at the prices and actually it's against the law to auto add the tip. Note to visitors  you can remove it. I didn't notice it posted anywhere in advance. I wouldn't recommend this place.< /text>< rate>

Food and service weren't that good... Our waiter kept forgetting some of our orders and the food wasn't that flavorful. ALSO, free was NOT as described. Gratuity was also added without being mentioned at all! The restaurant was wanting an 18% tip, which probably deserved a 10% tip. I definitely recommend checking out a different restaurant in the Chinatown area.< /Text>

Very bad food and very bad service.  They have a paper that says "20.95" special . They didn't explain that each plate was going to be $20.95 on the paper it doesn't say each. Dont fall for their scam. Lady outside handing out papers for free potstickers and free green tea ice cream with how much THEY chose to charge to tip we paid for it. They charged $18 tip for themselves.  They charged $18 for drinks ! Two can of sodas two bottle of waters and some store bought sour lemonade. DONT GO DONT GET FOOLED  BY THEM ! Over paid for some nasty food ! Never going back.</Review>

The REASON WHY I WILL NEVER COME HERE IS THAT, they did card fraud on my card right after paying, only used my card here the whole day and all of a sudden a whole lot of small transactions then big ones, be careful really sketch people there.

Our service woman (not the young one) got an order wrong and blamed us. The latrine for women was initially filthy with toilet tissue that contained human excrement was cleaned up quickly but jeez. Although my husband had a coupon for two free pot stickers, he never received them, even though we mentioned it several times. The other wait staff were very friendly.</Review>< user>

Food was delicious and plentiful and staff was friendly and helpful. I wanted something with curry, owner had dish prepared special for me that wasn't on menu. It had chicken and curry and veggies. It was great, just what I wanted. We were given a coupon when we got there and received an appetizer and green tea icecream free. They were both delicious, as was everything we ordered.< /text>

Came across this play while walking around town after work.  This place is such a great little find.  Got seated straight away, was able to sit outside on the upstairs patio.

Staff was extremely friendly, food was well prepared, and came out pretty quickly.

Upstairs patio has a great view of China town and downtown area!  Great place for a quiet date night!< /Review>

<text>We were greeted by a lady on the sidewalk distributing their promotion offer of free potsticks and green tea icecream with an order of one entree. So, we decided to try the place and it wasn't disappointing. The ambience is nice with soft Asian music playing. We ordered the salt and pepper crab 🦀, which was extremely delicious and better than what we had expected. The free potsticks were also good and appetizing. The green tea icecream at the end was one of the best I've ever had.</text>< Pics>

I really loved the food and service- they were all wonderful people! But I was a bit shocked by the bill- they added a 18% tip for a table of 2 people, forgot my main order, and charged me much more for the soup + entree combo.

Seriously though, awesome food but that really caught us off guard. $80 for a meal for 2 when we ordered 2 apps (which should have been $5-$6  & 2 meals that were priced at $12-$15) i wasn’t expecting that bill. Couldn’t even double check it because the bill handwritten...Other than that, this was great!<//text>

<Text>They're now calling themselves Beijing 39 or something. We've been going here for years. The food and service used to be mostly pretty good. Prices were fair and we got parking validated.
But today, the food was absolutely awful...awful, I could have prepared better. People were pleasant enough. Oh, and prices were MUCH HIGHER!

<review>First time trying Chinese food and being in San Francisco. This location was really welcoming to my group of 24 and attended us with great service. They even brought out dessert free of charge and fortune cookies. I thought the food was great, my friends ordered the noodles and dumplings. Everything was eaten up, I really liked the Sweet & Sour chicken. I recommend you give them a try, just because of my experience with the servers. Prices are reasonable for the portion. Give them a try!  👍🏽</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The price and quality of the food does not match. The staff seem friendly, however, were close to being overcharged by 50% of the final bill, we requested to recalculate which they did and realised their error. Thereafter proceeded to charge an 18% service charge as a "mistake" and Hoped it was okay
I would have preferred to tip  at our own rate considering it was just two of us. All in all disappointed
Let feeling ripped off. Was looking forward to the dinner but in the end I was glad to leave. Wish I had read the reviews earlier. This place is daylight  robbery! Someone needs to do something about this. Literally 60% of the reviews are complaining about the same issue! They are taking advantage of people. Stay away.</review>

I thought the food was excellent! The fried rice was very good as well as the orange chicken. Service was great, we came in with a group of 46 people and they took care of of with no problems. Give it a try!<//text>

<user>109707462141657076359<//user><Text>Food was great! However, tonight when the lady brought us our ice cream and check she literally tossed it down at our table and walked away fast. No joke. five cups of green tea ice cream and the check dropped in front of me and I had to pick them up and pass them to my husband and kida. My husband and I just looked down at the table and then at each other in silence. The last time we came here is was 5 years ago. Today we were visiting from out of town with our 3 boys. Just a fun getaway for the day and then we get treated like we didn't exist. No coming by our table to check on us or ask us if we needed anything. They weren't even busy. Sad thing is we were really looking forward to being there tonight but after the way we were treated I don't think we will return. Don't fall for their ladies out on the street handing out fliers luring you to their business with the promise of free potstickers with the purchase of an entree.< /Text>< Date>

We've been here as a family of four after our visit of Chinatown. I would only give 1.5 stars if possible. The service was decent, so was the food. But nothing special. Don't go here if you expect good authentic cuisine.
On a side note the restaurant seems to be stuck in time. When we asked for a receipt the copied the handwritten receipt we received before and gave it to us. They also only had plastic cups.

We were ushered into this restaurant by a couple of employees handing flyers out on the street. The food was good, but very overpriced for the quantity that was served. What really annoyed me, and what I found quite unusual, is that they included a tip in the bill (for our party of 3) and did not let us determine how much we wanted to tip. There was an extra charge for tea as well, which I was unaware of. It is not worth the price. 1 entree and two starters cost us $46.<//review>

Food was not great. Mixed drinks were undrinkable. To top it all of they handed us chicken scratch for a receipt and snuck in there a tip at the bottom which I still can’t decipher. Please don’t waste your time here.<//Text>

This place is ridiculously OVERPRICED. They say the potstickers & Ice cream are "Free" but add their own 20% Tip (You are basically STILL paying for it!). The service was TRASH. NO free refills or WATER. We literally got charged $4 for a bottle of Water!! DO NOT GO HERE! Avoid AVOID AVOID!!!< /Review>< Pics>

I give this one star for the food, if it was to rely solely on customer service, It’d be zero. I recently went there with a couple of friends because I used to go with my sister with no problem. When paying for the food (which is pretty overpriced) they charged a hefty tip onto my card without letting me know.  and when I brought it to their attention (mind you, over three times) they would walk away mid sentence! Even the manager left me and my friends with half a sentence. The bill was 85$ and we ended up paying $105. We will not be going back.<//review>

Don't be drawn in by the girl with the flyer. It's bad, very bad. Ribs were gone off, they stank. Wrong order brought to our table about 4 times. Charged a fortune for what we got. Do not waste your money on a promise of free chicken dimsums.< /text>

The food is not good,

Beside it's expensive they serve the minimum of food on each plate
For the money they're charging you expect little more
Don't get me started on the service they're All so rude and have attitude.
And on top of that they add 20% off tip without telling you.
And expect you to add more.</text>

I got the fish and tofu soup and it was okay. Our waiter forgot to get us our drinks which didn't make us happy. We found the place from a street solicitor who imposed his coupon  onto us. The place is so desperate for business they need to go to the streets.< /review>

Went with a group of nine, we went because of a person advertising on street. Messed up my order of Chicken Fried Rice, and were give Pork instead of Chicken, which we said 5 times , we are allergic. The free ice cream was 1) Horrible and 2) reimbursed with the 20% ..The Don't waiters made faces when we would say something like no tea or not being ready to order.. Don't  Suggest coming at all, should of read the reviews before we were seated.</review>

Not recommended!! Poor customer service and they charge you mandatory tip without any warning. You can’t leave without forcefully being charged a tip and on top of the mandatory tip their receipt also asks for an additional tip after you sign the receipt. They also forgot part of our order and when we were leaving tried to charge us for it anyway.<//Text>

I got vegetable rice which I knew would be hard to be disappointed with. It was 12.95 which was a bit much for fried rice with no meat. Felt a bit queasy afterwards but I think the food itself was okay.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is the Beijing Sijiu City on the first floor. It is a shop in the store and a restaurant opened for one year. Mainly in Beijing Palace cuisine, you can also order the dishes in advance~ The taste is very authentic, similar to the taste of domestic dishes. Very traditional cooking techniques, but the taste is home. Each component is very full, and the plate is well-regulated, and it looks like an old-fashioned restaurant. The environment is quite style, just like the tone of the big house door.

来的是一楼的北京四九城，算是店中店，新开一年的餐厅。主打北京宫廷菜，也可以提前包年菜哦～味道特别地道，跟国内的菜品味道很相似。很传统的一些烹饪手法，但是味道上又有家的感觉。每个分量都很十足，摆盘中规中矩，一看就是老式餐厅。环境挺有风格的，就像是大宅门的那种调调。</text>

(Translated by Google) We have not eaten so badly. The dishes tasted nothing. The soup of the Oberhammer ... purest porridge. The bill was wrong and the tip was already written on it ... was cleared during the meal and the ice cream was with plastic spoons. Are disappointed. Never again...

<text>(Translated by Google) The worst place to eat in chinatown. The food is disgusting. We ordered a broccoli beef when tasting the meat wise to rotten. The prices are ridiculously expensive. They didn't care that everything had been served without eating. In summary this place is a robbery, they force you to tip as it is included in the account. They don't deserve a single star

(Original)
El peor lugar para comer en chinatown. La comida es asquerosa. Ordenamos un brócoli beef  al probar la carne sabia a podrido. Los precios son ridículamente caros. No les importó que todo hubiese quedado servido y sin comer. En resumen este lugar es un robo, te obligan a dar propina ya que esta incluida en la cuenta.

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Great customer service , experienced staff , and great prices. This place is the only spot I go to for questions or help with my snake. This is, admittedly, my first reptile but I've come in before for recommending on what I should start with, also misconceptions, and all the good information I needed. The staff also makes it comfortable to ask questions and learn without feeling like you should already know your stuff. They also take really good of the animals they sell, and make sure to fully fill you in that day . Really an amazing place!</review>< Resp>

We decided after seeing their dragons compared to ours that we needed to get ours nails clipped and get some advice. Let me tell you that was the best decision we made! They were so encouraging and helped us figure out correct lighting and even helped our dragon eat some worms as he had never had live insects. They did not make us feel stupid or bad that our dragon was under weight and not getting enough UV light (I know we felt horrible) . I would 1000× over recommend them for everything reptile, they are kind , knowledgeable and helpful !</Text>< Pictures>

Brought it back a couple days later wanted to swap or get a partial credit. Apparently they do not do that. They took the rat and said they would feed it to one of their snakes though, even one they would eventually sell. They also do not inform you of this 24 hr policy, even when I sat there and questioned the size and if my snake would eat it

They are also really overpriced, even in comparison to pet co or pet smart. You can drive down to Chico to a much larger reptile store, with a larger selection and save quite a bit of money. Even on the littlest stuff like bedding or a tank.</Review>< pictures>

They are very knowledgeable and friendly and seem to want what is best for the customer and not their wallet. They won't try to sell you the most expensive thing if you don't need it... unlike the other places. The pets here are clean and well cared for. I can't wait too see what they do next! Very highly recommended.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Prices are reasonable compared to big box stores, except these people are reptile experts. They only sell you what you need and answer questions for free. They also help with rescue, rattle snakes and wildfire evacuations. They really helped our Boy Scouts with their reptile merit badge.</review>

The owners and staff go out of there way to patiently educate and shepard potential customers through the process of choosing and caring for a new pet.  There is good stock and see to the needs of expert and beginner customers.  They maintain a good selection of animals to choose from and view.  They also have an additional viewing room for a small charge that can even be arranged for parties...with COVID limitations.< /text>

Best place to find food for your snakes. They owners were very helpful when my son was on the hospital and I was charged with feeding his two snakes. They recommended the size and number of rats I needed. Boxed them securely too.<//review>

Best reptile store we have ever been in. The staff is very knowledgeable and always has time to answer questions. Multiple breeds of snakes and other reptiles, spiders and more! We visit weekly for feeders and bring our snake in from time to time to get their opinion on his health....etc.< /text>

<Review>This is best place to get anything for your reptiles. Whether it be food, lighting, accessories, or a new pet. Sandra and everyone else here are super friendly, and are quick to answer any questions you may have. They know what they're talking about and they actually take care of the reptiles, unlike Petco and PetSmart. Please, if you're thinking about getting a new reptile or set up, give them a visit.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Although at the time I purchased my items for my turtle that being hood light and light bulbs so he would be able to stay warm in his tank Lady at 1st seemed very helpful though the prices were quite extravagant at 1st and this be my 1st time owning a turtle I figured it was normal when I started having problems with the hood light and replacing the bulb I was given the wrong kind of replacement bulb by another employee who talked down to me and very condescendingly about the fact that I even had a red ear slider turtle as a pet though I had adopted it He talked to me like I was stupid and Like I had no clue what I was doing Without even taking into consideration that I had alredy researched how to properly care for my turtle then later on when I went to try to return the hood to address the issue of the fact that it kept blowing bulbs on one side which it shouldn't the lady ensured me that I had to have screwed in the bulb too tight theoretically that is impossible to cause a lightbulb to blow and since then I have discovered their prices are way too high they do not return their products or hold their policies and frankly I feel like they're extorting money out of people and giving them inaccurate information  I will never purchase another item from them again!  Very discouraging experience!< /Review>< Response>

Nice people, nice selection, my girlfriend's snake loves their rats! Very reasonably priced and is WAY better than Petco and PetSmart. Their animals are well taken care of and snakes are quality.

I [used to {when I was in Redding}] come here often for rats and crickets. I would highly recommend going here if you're interested in reptiles or need rats or crickets. They even have some hand raised rats if you want a rat, or at least they did not too long ago.<//Text>

We will never apologize for overeducating however it is never our intention to make someone feel bad about the care they give to their reptile.\n\nIn regards to your comment about us being very unorganized,  we keep stock of the reptile necessities - feeders, habitats, heating/lighting, food, decor, substrate and supplements and they are arranged within our store in an organized fashion.  Of course, there’s always room for improvement and would appreciate more hearing why you felt our store was unorganized and how we could improve it.'}< /Response>< GmapID>

This is a local meat market that carries a large amount of merchandise-everting you would need when inviting friends over. Very wide selection of snacks along with different types of meat. The focus seemed to be on adult beverages however looked like over 59% of beverages were nonalcoholic. Staff was very friendly during check out.<//Text>

They always have great sales. Aside from their deli meats and groceries they sell beer and liquor.< /text>

< Review>
Cold drinks but not worth the high prices, plus you might get attacked by one of the cashier for being right.  The only store in LA the is named with Mexico in it but not one Mexican world in the store, the product has layers of dust on them and the owner is  misogynistic narcissistic obese prick within better than you attitude. If your a female just go ahead and forget it, they do not let you slide for one cents! The side walk in from of the store it's years of filth that blacken the sidewalk less than 10 feet north of the entrance to the store.. Tacos are being sold on a raw $1.25 discriminate price...<//Review>

Friendly staff and very fast service. I knocked on the door, someone came out and I told them what I was looking for. He knew exactly what I needed and brought out a few sizes to make sure I had the best fit. The skates he recommended were the exact ones I read about online.

I recommend doing research and calling in advance if you're not sure what you want or looking for. There's no in-store browsing but they literally have everything you would need.<//text>

This shop is a hit or miss. It was a hard miss for me. The prices of items are inflated and more than they are online. I'd recommend buying online before going here because at least you can return your items if there is an error, especially if there is an error on their part that they won't take accountability for that ends up leaving you with an item you can't use that they won't take back. Depending on the day, customer service is also hit or miss. They can either be very helpful or very dismissive. Especially once they have your money.

I'll never return here. Ultimately I was extremely disappointed. My experience won't be everyone's.</Review>

Came by today to get a complete board. They were able to meet me at the front door. Talk me through what I’m looking for. And get me set up with an excellent new board. Tremendous value and great service. Excited to come back here once we can come inside.<//review>

I called ahead as I would be in the area a couple days later. The person I spoke to on the phone took time out of his day to text me pictures of all their roller skate wheels. This made me choose their store over others that were closer. I truly value that type of service.</Review>

What a convenient little chill store. The owner is really awesome & he helped my 10 year old son and I pick out an early Christmas gift. For 70s-80-90s folks there are some gems hidden throughout the store that will bring you back. My son is infatuated with his new board . Thanks again for all your help & company.</text>

Really annoyed by the customer service here. its like they don’t want to help you. Also pressure people into buying things and claiming the owner will do returns if things don’t fit then the owner says no returns.

follow up, thanks for the response, it was a two visit situation we hoped to the second visit would have been better but it didn’t solve anything and took a long time. the first person said you would take returns the second person was sluggish (understandable it was hot/etc) but we didn’t get any good answers and eventually just sold the item on facebook and everything was ok. I know its a good shop and i am sure in non covid times it would be fine, but just hearing people out would be great. thanks.< /review>

Was surprised to see their thrift shop items, very unique idea - there are some treasures if you look around. The staff loves this stuff, you can see it on all their faces and in their work. This company will grow into something even more amazing if it can embrace change and utilize its staffs passion.< /review>< Pictures>

I have heard amazing reviews about the shop so I had to check it out! I found great quality boards(used and new) for a reasonable price range.I would definitely recommend this skateboard shop for not only pros, but beginners. Additionally, the staff is amazing and very helpful for beginners like me. Once again, highly recommended and if you have a choice, PICK THE L.A SKATE CO.!< /Review>

<Review>Oldest shop in LA with extremely knowledgeable staff. If you get the opportunity to stop by the shop, owner LA Dave is an absolute Los Angeles legend in the skate community. He knows so much about the  sport and is always willing to take the time to get you in the best setup for you. Staff won't try to upsell you and listens to your needs and requests. Prepare to spend some time in there as they literally have thousands of skate decks to choose from. Prices are pretty much inline with your online resellers.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1563821961979, 'text': 'Thanks for your support Eugene.

The owner of this place is an absolute expert on every fine detail of a skateboard.  If you just want to buy a skateboard, you can go to many places, but if you also want to learn how a particular adjustment affects speed, etc., this is the place to go to see the pro.< /text>

<text>The owner, Dave, is a pleasure to do business with. He is knowledgeable, professional, and delivers a great customer experience. When putting your board together, he ensures it is done in the best way possible - for example, he ensures that the board you choose is actually straight before beginning the task.  This is attention to detail that gets missed in other shops. I have followed the shop since it's prior location in Silver Lake and I hope it continues to thrive.

<review>Oldest Skate Shop in Los Angeles! No trades. Only cash for parts or completes in good working condition. Incredibly friendly staff there to help you shop the very best deals to get you rolling. The very best deals on gently used footwear, clothing, and protection still will never compete with Dave's pro-tip to give that duracap on your Vans a coat of Krazy or Super Glue (promising outstanding wear prevention from grip tape abrasion). Grizzly CBD now in stock for under your sox. Thanks, Dave! Your store rocks my Redz roll! Happy 2020 New Year!< /review>< username>

We brought my 6 year old son in earlier this year to get him a "real" skateboard. Dave and rest of the staff spent a lot of time with us understanding what kind of skating my son does then helping pick an appropriate deck and components. The price was very reasonable and the service was first rate. My son's skating made incredible progress this year, getting him on the right board was a crucial first step. I highly recommend L.A. Skate Co. they know their stuff and will take care of you.</review>

This place was great. I wanted to build a new board and they had such a variety of decks it was amazing. They helped me immensely and I ended up getting all the exact parts I wanted. Now I have a beautiful board for great prices. Couldn't be happier definitely my new skate shop.< /text>

Dave of LA Skate Shop was great. Came looking for a new pair of roller skates to start skating again and he was intensely knowledgeable and friendly. Spent a good amount of time with me having me try on skates to get a good fit, taught me about wheels and plates and everything else! Will definitely be back and absolutely recommend.<//review>

These are people you can't trust. I decided to buy a pair of roller skates here, and to pay three times the price that was on Amazon, because they were for a show and I didn't want any risk. I ordered something specific, I waited for a week. The owner who assisted me ordered a man's size , he made a mistake. He new I had a time issue, I was very clear about that, so  he showed me a more expensive pair or roller skates. If he was a responsible people, who takes care for the mistakes he does, he would have sold me those for the same price of the previous. But he didn't. He asked for the difference. So now I need to change the script of my show because of him, because there's no way I could get the right pair in time for the show. I spent at least a couple of hours to decide and order and pick up. Plus the week I've waited. You decide if these are people you wanna deal with... Surely they won't see me anymore.</review>

{'time': 1542432957892, 'text': "This is an unfortunate situation. We ordered the best size we could get in a conversion from size 8 ladies white skates, to a men's black which would be a size 7. This is as close as we can get to a ladies size 8, as the model she wanted (a Riedell 111 Angel $129.99 MSRP) comes only in full sizes. We made every attempt to make the customer happy and in the end felt a full refund was the best course of action and wish this person all the best. We believe the customer was uneducated in the type and style of skates she needed for the project she was doing and unaware of the difference between mens and ladies boots and how they fit. We also believe blaming us for this situation is innapropriate as we delivered the product on time, in the size ordered and in the minimal time frame she allowed. This customer waited til the last minute to order this item and left no room for any adjustments.  L.A. Skate has always been dedicated to the best outome for all our customers whether new or old for the last 40 years, and will continue to do so."}< /Response>

Great service, even has parts for vintage decks, old trucks and wheels. Lots of cheap used decks, lots of new decks and parts at low prices, they will assemble your board for 10 bucks, if you don't want to do it yourself, while you wait,</text>

<review>I found my new skate shop today.

Fantastic selection.  Knowledgeable crew.  Grounded vibe.

Dave, the owner and skate legend, offers top-shelf, expert service for a friendly, neighborhood price.

I never felt pressured to buy anything - and he offered me inexpensive fixes for my board when he could have charged through the roof if he wanted.

He carries used decks and new - just so everybody can afford to skate.

Go try them out!<//review><response>None<//response><rating>5< /rating>< user_name>

We thought LA SKATE is the best store we could have possibly have ran into. It's tiny, still has a great selection of decks, and we loved the vintage clothing selection too. Staff was super helpful and very relaxed. We visited several other skate stores in LA which all pretty much breathe an unpleasant clean commercial vibe - but this little gem... this is just for ánd by REAL skaters. What you what you what you want! Many thanks 🙏</Text>

<Text>This skate shop has soul, you'll find what you need for a reasonable price. Dave (store owner) is a great guy, he knows his stuff.

They also sell used boards, shoes (even single shoe) and clothes (not sure about the latter), this would be a savior for me in my student years.< /Text><UserId.>105128138167902175124<//UserId.><Time>1494783987743</Time><pics>None</pics>< rate>

I was looking all over online for the best skate shop in LA /also affordable to buy my first skateboard  .As soon as I walked Dave said hello such a cool guy .I told him it's my first timer so he asked me a couple question regarding what I was looking for and what would be best ... just very honest.I also told him my limit and he worked with me and I left there with a brand new red wheel sweet rider for 85 bucks other places charge you over 120 bucks or more.  I say make your first stop at skate LA you won't regret it. I'm coming back also they have used and new gear it's  like heaven to a skater ..THANKS DAVE</review>

So I went to this skate shop this afternoon just 5 minutes before they close and usually when you get to a store just about the time to close you are not so welcome, but it was not the case, Dave and his associates were nice and made me feel comfortable, Dave helped me out to get exactly what I was looking for and needed. He has got 35 of experience in the business and he knows everything about skateboards and skateboarding; thru also have everything from old to new school skateboards and accessories. Do not think twice and Just walk in they sure have what you are looking for. Great shop in the heart of LA.</Text>

Doesn't get any better than feeling yourself in the vibe and culture of skating. The employees are honest and owner has astounding stories for days. LA Skate is where the culture is at.</text>

I called them up today asking if they had many choices in my size, and told them I'd stop by later. Upon arriving, they had all the shoes in my size pulled and ready to try on. All I can say is I got some dope kicks 😃 I'll be visiting again soon.</review>

(Translated by Google) The must-have skate shop here in L.A! An endless choice of wheel boards that the dealer assembles in front of you. The price is reasonable. It's extraordinary !
Worth the detour.

(Translated by Google) My wife and I went to buy a deck. There were many types of decks, and when I told the store clerk my favorite brand, I got multiple decks including ones that are not in Japan. At first, the owner worked hard at the desk, but when we were seriously looking for it, we came here with a smile and looked for me together. And while I was looking for, I was pleasantly talking about skateboarding and felt enthusiasm and love.
In the house, I am pleased to get a deck with the logo of this store.

The store clerk has a good attitude, a great smile on the owner, and a great variety of items. It is far from Japan, but I would like to visit the owner again.

(Original)
家内と二人でデッキを買いに行きました。デッキの種類が多く、店員さんに好きなブランドを伝えると、日本には無いデッキも含めて複数出してもらえました。オーナーは最初、机に向かって熱心に仕事をしていましたが、私達が真剣に探していると笑顔でこちらに来て、一緒に探してくれました。そして探している間もスケートボードの話を楽しそうに話していて、熱意と愛情を感じました。
家内は、この店のロゴ入りのデッキが手に入り喜んでいます。

店員の態度も良く、オーナーも笑顔が素晴らしい、そして品揃えも豊富でとても良いお店です。日本からは遠いですが、是非またオーナーさんに会いに行きたいと思います。< /review>

<Review>Allen the technician was good and professional.  We talk about sports to pass the time. He works quick and knows what he's doing. Doesn't just replace the recoil springs but takes his time to adjust to make it right. Friendly face and attitude. Would recommend Allen to my family and friends. Thanks Allen from Israel 👍<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>When I called to have my appointment time changed Jennifer made it happen with such kindness...
We had an issue with our garage opener, The repair man named Benjamin made us feel very comfortable with his advice, and the way he explain how the mechanism works all made sense (the opener was dated 17 years ago) so it was long over due for replacement.
Everyone acted very professional, and super kind and friendly. I am very glad I came across this company.
Thank you Benjamin and Jennifer.</text>< Pics>

Scheduled work for Monday and Jonathan made magic happen by sending Benjamin out on Sunday to fix my garage door. Benjamin was professional and had safety as a value. He replaced the springs, wires, and pulleys safely and quickly to give me my Sunday back. This job took a little less than an hour but is very dangerous. I cannot stress enough the professionalism and skill that Benjamin had to do the job. I am very pleased with the work done. If in need, I highly recommend First Garage Door and Gates.<//text>

< review>
First Garage Doors has been a savior for us on many occasions, and I’ve used them for both for my home and my business. As a real estate agent, I’ve had a fair share of garage problems. This company is amazing!

I have a three car garage and one of the coils on one of the doors broke about two years ago which was the first time I used their service. They gave me an unbelievable price to replace the coils on all three garage doors because they were all old and very low-quality. We bought our house new and the builder has installed the cheapest coils possible.

I called them again to fix our garage keypad which stopped working recently. They walked me through how to troubleshoot the keypad over the phone which was a success and extremely convenient! Now it works perfectly.

I also had another recent garage door issue at one of my listings. The garage door was old and not closing. Jonathon, one of the technicians met me at the property and was very professional and identified the problem immediately. Although the doors were old and needed complete replacement, he was able to fix it within minutes so I could go on with my next showing appointments. Truly a life saver! These are just a few of my experiences and I highly recommend this company for any and all of your garage needs! Thank you Jonathan and First Garage Doors!<//review>

< Review>
I can only provide 3 stars for this review.  I had them install two new garage doors and openers.  In general, the garage door installation went well, although I had to ask them to fix some issues that existed after the initial installation.  My reason for the lower rating is the fact that they were late 3 times without letting me know that they were going to be late.  The first time was when Jonathan came to provide an estimate.  The second time was when they came for the initial installation.  They said they would be at my house between 2:00-4:00pm but the first person did not show up until 5:30pm.  I postponed the installation at that point since I did not want them to rush the install.  The third time they were late was when providing follow-up service to fix issues with the first installation.  They said they would be at my house between 9:00-11:00am and when I asked around 10:45 if they were coming, I was told that they would not come until noon.  So, just be prepared for these types of issues if you move forward with this company.<//Review>

I was beyond frustration with Mesa Garage Doors. I needed help fast because the garage was wide open. First Garage Door and Gates sent a technician the same day who quoted me an unbelievable price, $500 less! They had an installer out the next day who worked hard to get the door installed,. Despite the obstacles he ran into, and these were significant, he was courteous and highly efficient. I wouldn't hesitate at all to personally recommend their service and would now like to publicly commend them for an outstanding job. I'm a General Foreman and wish that more people could provide this caliber of customer service.</Text>

Benjamin is courteous and  professional. He is very experienced and was able to tell me the issue with my opener immediately.
He helped me replace my opener within an hour and it works great now. He offered me a competitive price and also told me all the new features that comes with the new opener very patiently. He was also on time and showed up the day I called. I will highly recommend Benjamin and First Garage Door to my family and friends!!<//text>

I had a great experience with First Garage Door and Gates. I was lucky enough to have Benjamin as my garage door technician to install my garage door opener. I was impressed with how quickly he installed the garage door opener! Benjamin was professional and friendly, and I appreciated his explanation of the new opener. The whole experience was very smooth.</Review>

The tech Benjamin was here in 20 minutes on the dot. He did a great job replacing the torsion springs and get us back in action. Benjamin was extremely polite and knew his stuff. He was in and out in less than 35 minutes! Great experience all in all. Good and reliable service.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I need a new Garage door to replace my old ,broken one and have done a lot of research.

Many companies gave me very high prices,,

The last company I came across was First Garage Door & Gates. I met with  Jonathan . He gave me a good price (slightly lower than MESA, with better quality door) and Jonathan suggested me to pick the Unique Garage Door Company for my garage door.

Unique Garage Door Company is as good as  the top garage door company such as Clopay but with much lower price.

I picked their top of  the line option.

I got my new Unique Garage  door installed in a second  day!!  It is insulated steelback with R- value of 10. It is very strong and supper quiet. It has good quality materials.

The garage door was raised to over a foot higher for clearance with a LiftMaster Model 8500W garage opener.

I now can open my wife SUV, RX 350 lift gate inside the garage (could do it with the old one)
And I can also park my big sequoia inside if I need to.

Thank you Jonathan for such a great service and great price,,

<gmap_id>0x80dcdfa7ddcd856b:0x584333e4544c12e5<//gmap_id>< Review>
On Monday night my garage door collapsed as I was backing my car into the garage. I was able to close the garage door, but after that it was a wrap.  I looked for companies and checked out the reviews and First Garage and Gates had the highest ratings of anyone.  I contacted the company and to my delight they informed me that they would be able to come out to fix my garage the next morning.

The gentlemen from the company were on time and competed the service in about 30 minutes.  I was shocked to that they finished so quickly because prior to the door being fixed it looked like a disaster that would take all day to fix.  The service was great and I couldn’t be happier with the results.  Prior to service my door made noise when activated and it sounded horrible.  Now everything is working properly with no issues I highly recommend First Garage Door and Gates for your service needs!!< /Review>

<Review>Adam arrived on time and gave us a fair and honest estimate. His knowledge and experience was apparent from our conversation before the work began. He replaced the opener on our current (and really old) door fairly quickly and we are very happy with the installation and operation. We will definitely be calling this company back when we are ready to upgrade the garage door!<//Review>< Name>

Benjamin showed up in the same day and he's courteous and  professional.

He's very experienced and right away
told  me exactly what need to repaired , just change some parts of my garage door. He did not  upsell me. Unlike the other company told me that I need to replace the garage door and opener !!!!

Benjamin is so honest. Nowadays it's quite hard to find a good company. I will definitely recommend First Garbage Door and Gates to all my friends! This company is a keeper!!! I know I can trust them!< /Review>

My spring on my garage door snapped and I called First Garage Door and Gates and they were able to send a tech same day.  The tech, Allen, arrived on time during the arrival window. He came with everything needed to fix my garage. He explained the problem to me and I was able to understand what needed fixing. He was an overall genuine and honest guy. I will definitely refer this company to family and friends.  Thank you Allan and First Garage Door and Gates.< /Text>

Allan did a fantastic job installing our garage door opener. I ran into a tight spot late in the afternoon and needed them to come same day.

He came to my place on the promised day and made appropriate adjustment for the springs. My garage door is heavy but thanks to the adjustment, door can be lifted easily just in case we need to open the door manually. Thank you for your hospitality and professional work.

Thank you, Benjamin, for the professional work. 20 years old springs and opener were replaced quickly. I sent a couple of texts after he left as I had some questions about operation and he gave me a call back right away. He also does for follow up visit if needed. Thank you again for the work. I recommend this company.</review>< Rating>

Garage door stopped working yesterday afternoon, called them around 7pm and they arrived this morning. Allen was able to diagnose the problem literally in 3 seconds. He explained to me what was wrong and gave me an estimate. He finished the work quickly. Really nice guy. Happy with his work.

Update for 8/3/21

Called today because garage door stopped working on way to work. Nathan arrived within their time-frame. He worked quickly and double checked everything. He also did maintenance that was overdue. Would definitely recommend and as you can see, I am a repeat customer.</Review>

Jacob came by and was very informative about our options. He then priced the job, and was able to get the order executed within 24 hours which was surprisingly quick. More importantly, the technicians were early, friendly, informative, and competent. We moved into a new home in need of several upgrades and the electric gate had been a big problem. Many claim to be gate technicians, but the lads at First Garage Door and Gates are your best bet.< /text>

<Text>Belt broke on our Liftmaster. Called First Garage on Labor day and they even tried to get someone out that day! Ended up coming the next day but that was no problem. He checked out the belt and quickly realized the spring was going out and suggested we replace that as well. Gave us a good price so ended up replacing the belts and springs on all 3 openers. Great guy to deal with. Very helpful and friendly! Well definitely refer to friends and use again when the time comes!<//Text>< Pics>

After checking out the reviews on here I decided to give them a try when my parent’s garage door chain broke off the track.  Booking the appointment was easy.

We were able to get a same day appointment and both the dispatch center and technician communicated efficiently via text.  I found that option very convenient.

Even though there was a delay in the appointment time they communicated with us beforehand to make sure it would be ok with us.

We had Benjamin and he was very nice, professional and did the job right.  Garage is now fixed and working great.  My parents are happy with the service and I am glad I trusted Benjamin and First Garage Door and Gates.< /review>

I cannot say enough good things about Jonathan.
He is truly amazing-friendly and very knowledgable.
My garage door failed. He came to my house within a couple hours of my call.
Jennifer was also really great and very nice over the phone
Anyway he returned the next day with the needed parts, we have a custom wood door so its need a custom parts
I was very pleased with the results and especially with the quality of his work
I highly recommend him and First Garage Doors and Gate

Needed one of my garage springs replaced as it snapped. Looked online for a reputable repair company. Found Jonathan and really glad I did. He was very honest, professional, and on time. Prices were reasonable and service was outstanding (I'm always willing to pay a little more for a product/service I trust). Would highly recommend Jonathan if you need any type of garage services!<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I had a spring on my garage door break. I called them at 7am and received a call back almost immediately. They said they would have someone out between 8 and 10, and they would call and confirm. They were hear around 9. Very pleasant and very professional. Found out that the wrong springs were put in by a previous company. They installed the correct ones, adjusted and balanced everything and greased and oiled moving parts. It operates smoother and more quiet than ever. Couldn’t be more pleased. They use quality parts and do great work! I highly recommend them,<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1597801240164, 'text': 'Thank you very very much Jack !\nWe really appreciate it\nHere for you anytime\nThank you !'}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcdfa7ddcd856b:0x584333e4544c12e5< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

One of the springs in my garage door broke and I found “first garage door and gates” on line and I couldn’t have made a better decision.  They came within a couple of hours and replaced both springs at a very reasonable price.  I definitely recommend them  as a reliable company and profesional service.

Thank you, Jennifer!< /review>

I waited an extra day based solely on the reviews I read. I am happy I did. Technician came out and assessed the issue quickly. Gave me a couple options to consider and went about the work I selected quickly and professionally. Any future issues, I’ll only contact First Garage Door and Gates.<//review>

Very positive experience w/ First Garage Door and Gates. From the initial contact w/ Jennifer to set up an appointment, through installation, they were very professional. Ofer came out out, assessed my needs and then scheduled his crew to come back and install a new Liftmaster rolling gate to replace a piece of junk GTO gate motor we had.</Review>

<text>I came home from work and the coil spring had broken and the garage door was not operating.  As a result the garage door opener broke off from its mount.  I had previously had the same problem but didn't like the previous companies I had used.  I called 1st garage at 610pm and they arrived by around 9pm.  I spoke to Jacob he sent over Benjamin.  Benjamin was very helpful.  He not only promptly fixed the spring he adjusted the door and cleaned up all of the broken materials.  He was professional and honest.  I would recommend Benjamin if the need presented itself.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>The garage door was installed ahead of schedule.  The installer made sure it the remote controls were programmed to work.  The only problem was that the molding was not wide enough to cover the frame of the garage.  Benjamin said I just need to paint it to cover the exposed wood.
There was a miscommunication on the warranty and Benjamin followed up with it and rectified it.</Review>< Pictures>

Hi there again this is Brian cho writing another review I had to log into a different Google account bc i am unable to extend my original review..
Had to also replace the screw drive portion of the garage door opener so Jacob was able to find the part and install it properly.  He had to make a few custom adjustments to our set up but in the end of an hour, it was working fine and all good. Again Jacob was professional and very pleasant and friendly.
A couple days later i had a couple of concerns due to a couple of sounds i was not used to hearing and another aspect i was not used to.
Jacob out of his own time graciously accepted coming to see me again to make sure what i was seeing or hearing was fine or if something needed addressing. I just needed a peace of mind.
He did stop by at an agreed time frame when he was in the area and showed me and explained to me the couple of concerns were not concerns at all but something that was different due to the different model of replacement and situation and relieved me w knowledge and explanation to make sure i clearly understood what was going on.
Jacob thanks for your service and friendly communication during the last 2 weeks.
We will hope to see you guys in business in the future ...hopefully this time in a good many years down the road. God bless thank you.</review>

<text>I called what I thought was Chamberlain support, but it wasn't.  Jonathan with First Garage answered.  He helped me when he didn't have to.  Our issue was; the garage door started opening back up as soon as it closed, so in other words we couldn't close the door without disconnecting the drive. We face-timed and he helped me reset garage door electronics.  If you ever need a door service provider, Jonathan sincerely cares about the customer.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

I like to thank First Garage Door & Gates, called them at 2 am my garage door collapsed. They said we’ll send someone out at 7am. Very professional broke it down to me about repairing it. He told it’s too badly damaged for repairs, it would be wiser to replace everything. He was off came back with my new door. The installer came by shortly after and bamm!!! I’m glad I went with all new parts,  my garage door came out fabulous!!!!  Thank you for all your help and excellent service. I would definitely recommend First Garage and Gates to all my family and friends< /text>

Upgraded review to 4 stars because company stepped up and met competitive pricing. Knowledgeable and efficient technician. Pleasant.  Notified that arrival would be late. Original low rating was for high pricing.  After the fact research found local company installs same unit ( identical unit/model) and drive assembly for considerably less. Company wants to do the right thing by its customers.</review>

Jonathan responded timely in response of my need. He was professional and kind. He spent time with me to explain to set up garage door opener ,auto and cell phone programming. Garage Door is working nicely and is not making unusual noise. May consult him again if there is any problem with garage door.< /Text>

Very persistent and pushy. After giving me his price for a new garage door, and declined moving forward with his company, he tried to charge me for the estimate ($29).  I was never informed there would be any fee for an estimate.  Had several people come the same day to give estimates and was not charged by anyone else, and some had come from down the hill.<//text>

I am very satisfied with the service I got with this company.

The owner (Jonathan) himself came all the way to South Bay area from
OC to come and fix my garage door when he could’ve easily sent one of his workers to do it. He knew the urgency of my problem so he took it upon himself to get the job done and I appreciated that so much.

He came and assessed the problem and fixed it in less than an hour. He even checked the other parts of the garage door to ensure it was secure.

Jonathan definitely went above and beyond on the job he did.... I know now who to call when I have garage door issues!

I highly recommend First Garage Door and Gate.

Thanks Jonathan!</text>

The springs of my pretty old garage door were broken and when I called Jonatahan scheduled an appt right for the next day and Fred came and suggested that it would be a better option to change the old garage door for some extra money instead of spending on the springs and which I thought was a pretty honest & good suggestion. The quote he gave for the new door was pretty good and after checking with others I found that their quote was the cheapest and they installed the new door as per my desired date. They were on time and the new door was installed pretty good. I highly recommend this company, they are the best.< /Text>

<review>I had an emergency with my garage door preventing me from getting out of the garage  and called First Garage Door & Gates.  I live out in the Inland Empire in Canyon Lake.  The owner, Jonathan, answered the phone immediately and was able to walk me through my garage door issue .  For this gentleman to offer his services on a Sunday over the phone without hesitation, in the extremely nice and professional manner in which he did, blew me away.
Any other company on my opinion would have insisted on coming out for a service call.
Jonathan even went so far as to give me his cell # if I had an additional issue so I could reach him even faster.
I’m in my late 40’s and you just don’t see people do business like this anymore-  “The Good Old Fashioned Way”
I never write reviews and he had such a positive impact on my day I was compelled to write about my experience with his company.
I’ve dealt with garage door company’s in the past and you get passed around and they try and do a sales job on you.  This is not that company.
Thanks Jonathan !!!

<Text>Called Jonathan on a Sunday for a garage door that wouldn’t open and he not only answered the phone but got to my house in 1 hour as promised and fixed it.

Before calling First Garage Door and Gates / Jonathan... I called Precision Garage Doors first thing in the morning and then twice more to follow up as to arrival times.  Their operator answered saying they would send the tech out and would call me on his way.  6 hours later, no call from the tech and garage wasn’t fixed.

Jonathan is nice and experienced and will call him if ever needed again.  Couldn’t recommend a more efficient garage door repair company.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Text>A very professional outfit from beginning to end! Jonathan answered our initial inquiry within the hour and stopped by the same day to discuss the project. He offered very politely his professional input when we asked andbl we are so grateful. He really knows his products and services well. And if something is unfamiliar, he does the most thorough research and inquiries and comes back with the best information!
The locking  side door that he designed for us is so elegant beyond our wildest expectations! The installation was perfect and precise. His crew was absolutely professional and does the most careful and meticulous job.
First Garage Door and Gate has the honesty and personal touch of a longstanding family owned and operated business and the professionalism and precision of the larger and grander corporate firms.
The best combination in a company that I trust will continue to be very successful.
Thank you so much Jonathan and crew!<//Text><userid>113500720201123470152< /userid><Pics>None<//Pics>< rate>

Great experience and will use them again if needed.
I had something break in the garage mechanism last week that scared us as it was a huge reverberating drill type sound. Door wouldn't open and i had to manually lift the door and close it every single day since to allow myself and my wife to go and return from work.
It was a huge stress on my part as i couldn't figure out what to fix and it was just another added distress and i was a bit desperate.
Jonathan came to see me as promised and looked over everything and relieved me that it is something they can fix.  He assured me that this was a typical issue for the area i am in. I thought i was going to be in financial trouble here but he assessed simply it was a fix done in 2 hours and a cost that was very reasonable and hopeful for me. His partner Jacob later that nite returned to see me as they wanted me not to wait another day. He swiftly and confidently did all the work ...i mean it was a huge undertaking to my eye ...very complicated and involved taking out the frame off the wood and so forth. I was extremely concerned w competency as i have had bad experiences in the past w vendors doing work on my home and being overly confident but at the end being careless about something regards to their visit.  Jacob was not that way.  Although there was needed a ton of elbow grease and experience and nuance to do this job properly ..he did it just the way my picky mind expected him to do without me even muttering a word. He explained even the smallest nuance that he did that maybe otherwise overlooked by others and may cause issue in long term and performed that part extra just to show he cared genuinely.
The ratchety sound from the screw lifter? Well he also took a look at that disassembled my whole garage door unit and readjusted the screw so it was properly calibrated again and put everything back together again.
All in all i believe honestly it was totally worth the price they quoted me. This was something i would have never been able to do nor even some home depot or lowes i looked into prior. They would have less experience and perhaps miss all the nuances Jacob addressed for me and perhaps even just say hey you need a whole new garage door opener.  Jacob didn't. He applied extra elbow grease to my issue just like he was helping out a good friend or relative.
I will without a doubt go back to these guys if heaven forbid i get another garage issue. Which was harrowing.   God bless!<//text>

First Garage fit me into their schedule the same day I had called.  Johnathan was efficient and professional. He threw away all of his trash leaving only a pristine worksite and a brand new garage opener for us.  He had the new opener on his truck, ready, so he was in and done quickly.  Thank you!<//Review>

I got home from work yesterday and my garage door would not open. Unfortunately it is the only way to enter my home.
I was sooo stressed out. I found first garage door on google and Jonathan said he would come over right away, and he did!
I did not realize anything was wrong because it was fine when I left in the morning.
Jonathan came straight to me and replaced 2 springs and gave me a tune up.
I was so happy. He was such a nice man and even though it was an emergency, did not take advantage.
The job was clean and reasonable and I am very happy to refer this business to my friends and family.  Thank you Jonathan!! Great job and I appreciate that you came right away.
Great job First Garage and Gate!< /text>

we kind of broke the garage at 1145pm and frantically were looking for a 24/7 serviceman to fix it since our garage door was hanging open mid-way up. i called first garage door and was answered promptly! Jonathan texted he'd be over in less than 45 mins. 3 brackets were broken, one of the wheels was off track and the cables were just all messed up. he fixed everything in less than 15 minutes. he's super friendly and accommodating even though this was a midnight job... sorry about that!! highly recommend first garage door and gates!< /Review>

I called after midnight on a Saturday when my garage door came off the tracks and Jonathan was out the next morning to fix me up. Prices were fair and service was great. Hope I don’t need them again for awhile but I know where I’ll go when I do!</Text>

<Name>F M< /Name><Text>Jonathan did a great job of resolving the problem with our garage door opener not functioning. He found an identical replacement unit, 3 years newer, in his truck and helped re-program our remotes. Excellent service at a fair price. Highly recommend Jonathan!

Nov. 2020....A brief power outage required a manual opening of our garage door and later, when the power was restored, the motor turned, but the door didn't raise up. Jonathan responded the next morning and in about 1 minute showed me how the manual release cord needed to be adjusted to engage the gears. Problem solved...excellent work Jonathan!</Text>< UserId.>

our garage door stopped lifting suddenly om Friday and I needed to find someone to fix it before the holiday weekend. I called First Garage Doors and Gates in the morning and I was scheduled for noon. they even called me to let me know when their tech was their way.                                                              Jonathan came by and showed me that the tension springs went out and needed to be replaced. Not what I wanted to hear considering I had a plumber at my house the same time for some garbage disposal issues.                                                                                                                                                After agreeing to the repair, Jonathan left to their local warehouse and retrieved parts. when he returned, he got straight to work and got the repairs done quickly. He was very nice throughout the whole job and we even talked a little about trucks and camping locations.                                                               First Garage Doors and Gate made the whole situation painless.                                                                                     Today wasn't the best day but at least I found a great plumbing company and a great garage doors company I can rely on.<//Review>

Shows up when he says he will! Gives me solid quote on garage door replacement. Tells me he'll be back in two days and when mind you! 2 Days Later, shows up when he says he will and takes care of business within a couple of hours! Articulates what he's going to do and handles it like a pro!</Review>

When I was refered by my nephew i thought ok hes used them good to use someone you know. I can tell you my man Frank took care of me like I was family. He got me a unit close to the nephew. It was reasonably priced. Set up the paperwork over the phone and had me taken care of in a short period of time. It was quite the pleasure working with him.
Thank you.<//Review>

I have had a storage unit at National for almost 20 years. My family and I were satisfied with the protection and care of our belongings for numerous years and varying circumstances. The facility is safe and the units are under constant surveilance. After 20 years, when I emptied my storage yesterday and couldn't make it into the office, the management staff contacted me to clarify whether we were and had vacated their unit. I appreciate this follow through. Thanks so much to the many staff over the years.<//review>

It's a shame they let people live there in the units.  I guess it's a little better with the new managment( who i would drug test) but less homeless rating there now. Yes I do know of two that still live in units.</review>

Clean storage units and friendly staff. The security system is top notch and the cameras are very new and high tech. They don't have moving supplies right now, but they do sell locks for the storage units. No climate controlled units, but clean and dry.</review>

<review>This facility was recommended to me by another past and satisfied tenant.
I chose this mainly because of the Manager Wendy, she sold me on her helpfulness and friendliness. When I met Wendy she was excellent with her customer service.  It is a drive up entry, but the hours and the accesability are excellent. I'm glad that it was available, but more so I'm glad that Wendy was there to make the transition comfortable.</review>< Resp>

<Review>We have had multiple units here over the last couple years. We have had issues with moisture getting inside and causing mold and mildew on our property.  We were moved to another unit and started finding mouse droppings. I brought it to the managers attention and was told they have a service and couldn't do anything else. I put a couple traps out and have cought mice with what appeared to be a used condom in its mouth. Ended up having to call a got junk service and having half of our belongings dumped.<//Review>< pics>

However when a health conscious rat happens upon a unit with Muscle Milk inside, they are hard pressed to resist a treat. This is why in our lease, food and drink are prohibited as a stored item.  It just too much temptation for a rat.\n\nWe’re sorry your sentimental items were damaged and are happy to help you submit a claim through our tenant insurance program.'}</response>

<text>Overall location gets a 4.5. There is quite a bit here, but not exactly a lot either. Asada burrito and tacos are great! Red and green sauce are excellent and unique. Little bit of heat on both. Food was awesome, will come back again soon to try more. This location is a small grocery also. They don't have a huge selection, but you could make just about any mexican food item you want with what can be found inside. Was quite pleased to find marjoram on the spice wall and a few other items you don't find everywhere. Serve Thrifty ice cream, decent looking meat counter. The pan dulce selection was really limited, had hoped for more. Staff were extremely friendly, was warmly greeted and assisted. Neighborhood location is in, not that great, will want to be aware of your surroundings when you are there. Location is clean, but could stand for some upgrades. Decent amount of parking, should be really easy to get to, very close to freeway. Parking, entrance and aisles are all accessible. Visit during COVID, so no chairs and didn't see a bathroom. Will return again soon, possibly best burritos for 5 miles around. Beans and rice great for burritos, but not best rice and beans ever had.
Oh, I wouldn't ever take a date here, but would happily bring this to someone I'm seeing, they will love it.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Craving carne asada and costillas. Been coming to this place even before it was Raffa's. Always has good meat product. Not a huge variety but exactly what most us Latinos like. Because of the current situation the price of meat is high but always nice to treat yourself.</Text>

Also I got Lengua tacos and it the tip of the tongue with the taste buds showing was a bit much for me. I ordered 4 pieces of chicharones and 2 of them still had pig hair...

<text>Always a buyer in the past from “big” dealerships, I was skeptical at first of going with a smaller outfit, but was delightfully surprised with my decision to check out MAL.  Not only did they pack in a lot of great late model quality inventory into their lot, but they were also honest and priced lower than I expected, probably a result of having lower overhead than those mega-dealerships.  Very satisfied with the entire process! William was a great sales person and very accommodating to the many questions I asked along the way about the vehicles I wanted to check out!</text><username>Jimmy Nevarez<//username><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5sS05mN6QOT0v273u-3hLhMPwXwweSwERMJ23=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<review>Looking for used vehicle is tough. metro Auto Loan made it easy by starting at a great price leaving no need to negotiate. This place was about the tenth dealership I stopped at, I should have come here first. Ask for Ray, he's very upfront with everything and easy to work with. Thank you Ray! Do your homework and then check with Metro Auto Loan first!< /review><user>108691812618191786530< /user><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80c34bbe8b05103b:0xf40e44d9f8a81dff< /GmapID><rate>5<//rate></record>

I found this dealership through Car Gurus. I was so pleased with the service and the experience. My Fiancé and I purchased a 2017 Ram 2500 and got a great deal on it. I was skeptical coming here at first because it is a smaller dealership but the customer service I received here was far better than most large scale dealerships. I will be recommending them to family and friends. 10/10< /review>

I like to say that this has been by far my best vehicle buying experience since 20 years ago. These fine group of professionals take the time to show the vehicle and work with you to get what you like. I have been extremely taken care of including to the level that they are professionals with commitment they respect what ever agreements we decide and make transition seamless.  I purchased a 2018 F350 in great shape they even allowed me to bring my own mechanic to inspect it,  something other find offensive and therefore treat us worse. Overall best team Eddie great man. "The Man". And Ray also good to work with. Thx you guys. I highly recommend these folks for your work vehicle or any needs.<//Text>

Was looking to get a new car and walked came upon the lot not even intending on buying today and walked off extremely happy. When I arrived I got a friendly meeting from Ray who had just the car for me! We took it on a drive and me and my Dad were sold! Everyone always dreads the long buying process you have to go threw when getting a car but with Ray it only took moments to get us a good deal. I definitely recommend metro auto loan!<//text>

<Review>I bought a car, very nice salesman, but his boss was very rude, he threatened me to put me under the category of the people who doesn’t pay on time, when I have been paying everything on time. At first I was going to make this dealership my “go to” but after this I’m definitely going to change to another one.</Review>< pictures>

< review>
Went in for a truck that was 32k. They were trying to sell it for 41k OTD!!! The salesmen tried to tell me to go look at the computer that breaks down the price. When I saw that their was a add-on interest rate of 3.140% the finance manager got mad and left. Called them out on their own scheme and they got mad. They were then saying that they have another customer coming in to look at the truck after me, I told them to sell it to that person cause I am not paying 9k in interest + fees, and they pretty much told me to leave if I am not buying it.< /review>

The Radio/big screen was dead, it had the wrong color headrest, and was missing one of them.

Metro Auto Loan(independent dealer)  told me that they will have the Fiat dealership replace the Radio under warranty and the will buy amd replace the missing headrest.  In short I offered to buy it at their asking $6499, our Out The door for around $7600. They would not tell me exactly what I was paying for but I pressumed taxes amd licenses.  Anyway, I agreed and asked them to have the radio fixed and completed the missing headrest.  I asked what the next steps would.  Then I was out in hold then told they were raising the price for another $500, and they will not sell it for the adverstised $6499.  They just wasted my time.

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME either AND PASS ON THIS dealer.  THEY ARE UNPROFESSIONAL.

<Text>Ray is very attentive and helpful. He offered us a great deal with a fair interest loan on a quality truck. If you come to metro I recommend asking for Ray. He’s not pushy and he addresses all your questions.< /Text>< pics>

Ray was great!!!!!
Very, very professional,  my wife and I  were very pleased with the kind of customer service Ray gave us.

Pictures don’t always reveal everything so you have to trust your salesman.

Worst place to go to we purchased a truck on Aug 18 and by Aug 20 check engine on, fuel gas does not let us pump gas in it, different dashboard lights on for windshield wipers which we put and does not come off and side view mirror broken. I spoke with Sergio and he just laughed and joked around. Bad service and requested my money back. But being told no no no. I wanted to buy a truck that works not junk.<//Text>

<Text>these people DO NOT CARE about you, they only care about your money. My  husband recently bought a 2006 F-150, and it was trash. IT WAS A LEMON CAR. As soon as he had signed the contract they had told him about 2 days later that no one wanted to pick up the loan because it was too small. They asked my husband to ask his bank to pick up the loan...- what kind of salesman asks the customer to ask their banker to pick up a loan....- it is the salesman's job to look for a bank to pick up the loan. Second, a week after my husband had the car, it started to have problems. The valve lifters on the truck were going bad and the transmission started to slip, and it turned off when turning the wheel to reverse. We took it in because of the 30 day warranty and they mentioned they were going to fix it. We got the call to pick it up and they had only changed the oil?? they told us to drive 500 miles and if the problem persisted they would change the oil again. We asked for that on paper, and they refused. And they went for a verbal contract/agreement. Absurd... we drove for 500 miles and the problem persisted they took it back and said they were going to fix it... point of the story is that they never fixed the valve lifters and stated that the transmission never slipped.  Today, my husband and I went in and told the Sales Manager that we were frustrated and needed to get the car fixed as stated in the California Lemon Law. They refused, and I told him we were going to sue. He directly told me to shut my mouth as I did not know what i was talking about. THESE PEOPLE DO NOT CARE, I ADVISE YOU TO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS.

p.s. we got our money back.<//Text>< pictures>

I gave them a one star because they are NOT  HONEST  at all...bought a  car and they tricked me into over paying the down payment. Then 2 weeks later the check engine light came on and they wanna tell me it was the gas...Seriously?  Then when the car broke down on me they promised to fix it and the only changed the battery after I argued with them for 3 days. One guy even called me and told me to come get my money back because they weren't going to fix it...but their Golden Boy Ray, said he would take care of it.....not even. They REFUSED  to sent my car to a real mecanic. Then once I got my car back I see they changed the Pirelli tires for off brand tires. (PETTY) For all I know they might have sabotage my car for something to go wrong. They are so fake and fony....I am so dissatisfied with them.
My suggestion go somewhere else because if your car breaks down in that first 30 days your screwed  They aren't going to help you....DONT believe anything they say!!!</text>

The whole team at Metro is by far the most accommodating sales team available.
My name is Jesus, I speak for the Vazquez family when I say how well we have been treated. We got the lowest interest, and our payment was budget considered Amazing! After more than 10 cars the deals don't get any better. This dealer is definitely worth the drive. We live in Indio about two hours away. Arturo was nice enough to drive out here on many occasions to save us a trip. To the gang well see you again.

The Vazquez Family.</text>

Salesman sold me a bad car, overheated on me the second day i had it then i brought it in, the car has been in the shop since the day i got it. The car has been in the shop for 10 days now and havent recieved no phone call to see whats going on with my vehicle. They let me use a car but then tried to charge me for the miles i put on it, what was i supposed to do? just let the car sit there? i bought a car for a reason...to use it. I asked for my downpayment back and the guy refuses to give it back because of the miles i put on the car.<//review>

i asked him about warranty, its crap and placed to where you would have problems after like usual.
I asked him about the oil changes and where he takes the vehicles, HE SAID WALMART, you know, the non certified technicians? the olive oil scams? the +1k 1 star ratings and reviews and countless lawsuits for blown up engines? when i checked the oil on the car i test drove it was darker than it should of been for 40k miles.

after i said no i'm leaving because of you cutting corners he got mad and told me to gtfo.

DO NOT SHOP HERE. because the first thing out of their mouth when i walked inside was how i was going to pay for the car, they don't care about the cars or you, only your money.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

They don’t deserve a star unfortunately you have to put one , very bad service and they’re a bunch of liars , a salesman ( Gonzalo) maid me drive 2 hours away to see a truck when I’ve asked him if the truck was still available he told me yes I drove from far away and the truck had already been sold, very bad costumer service don’t waste your time with these folks< /text>

Pretty good food! You get chips and salsa at the table. yummy. 3 kinds of salsa. Ocean views! Pretty much anywhere you sit, you can see the ocean.

I got a chicken torta. So good! There wasn't very much meat. But it was still really good. Great flavors. Does not come with any side.

Hubby got 2 Al Pastor soft tacos. Sour cream on the side. Came with onion and guac. They were delicious! Very tiny though.  Came with beans and rice. Both basic. Nothing special.

No drinks. Just water. Came to around 27 bucks. Not bad. The portions are on the small side though.

The service was OK. Attentive, but not friendly. They all had very serious faces. No smiles. No small talk. A bit cold. But, this seems to be normal these days.

Food was pretty good. Great views. They also have a bar inside, and the bathroom is outside. Parking is limited. Small lot. There we're about 12 cars in the lot, with a few spare. But only 4 tables occupied. We will be back.

We had a night off, and decided to drive down here to have dinner. It's off on a side street. No ocean view. It's in a tiny shopping center, that almost looks deserted. Super easy to find, since there is a large sign on Hwy 1.

Just a couple of people inside when we arrived. Pretty quiet. The girl who helped us was friendly. Must be family operated, there was a toddler running arround.

We ordered the carnitas fries to share. They were very good. Had pork, cheese, and sour cream. We got pico de gallo on the side, since  hubby can't eat it. He got a beer, and I got a pineapple soda.

I ordered 2 hard tacos. One chicken, and one carne asada. Both were good. But 3 bites. I didn't get any sides. Hubby got 3 soft tacos. Those were 2 bites. Tacos are good, but VERY small. He got beans and rice. Both were good. I LOVED the rice. Very moist and flavorful.

You also get chips for the table. They have 3 salsas. But they are all runny, and just liquid. We didn't care for any of them. Food was decent, but not amazing.</review>< name>

<Text>BOMB! Had the Chili Rellenos and a michelada. It's a little pricey but the quality of food is so good it's worth it. The artistic resturante furniture was super awesome as well, the whole atmosphere was great. Service was very attentive as well. 4 stars because the chips were kinda stale, however The salsa was so good we ate 2 baskets of chips despite the staleness. Will most definatly be back for another meal!</Text>< pictures>

I remembered this location as having been a roadhouse from a previous coast trip several years back.  This time it was Antonio's, and I'm glad we tried it!  We were in town for 4 days.  We tried Antonio's for dinner the first night and everything, in our opinion, was perfect!  We ended up eating lunch or dinner there 2 more times.  Good ingredients, everything was perfectly cooked, the seasonings well-balanced, the sauces are great and the views are as good as it gets.  The building is newly remodeled and the interior is colorful and fun.  I tried a different meal every time and everything was top-notch.  The most consistently good Mexican restaurant I have come across, so I just had to give a review.</review>

We went for breakfast/lunch and we were seated quickly, that was the fastest thing that happened. I asked if they were still serving breakfast and the waitress had to check, that took more than 5 minutes. Ten minutes later the waitress asked for our beverage order. I had to ask for chips and salsa.
Another 5 minutes later she came back and asked for our order. The food was bland and the plating was very generic. We will never return.<//review>

We were staying at Sea Ranch for the week and asked a local where to eat. She suggested Antonio's.  So glad she shared. It's a small place behind the hardware store. Easy to miss unless you are looking for it. Don't pass it by if you are hungry for Mexican food. I had mole enchiladas.  It tasted like someone's grandma had been slaving for days over the mole. The beef nachos were also delicious.</Text>

<review>This place is small in size (maybe 5 tables inside and a couple outside) but big in food. Taco Tuesdays are great - $.99 tacos! They also have good burritos and Tricia loves their tostadas. One of my favorites is the green salsas. They usually have 2 and both are wonderful. We eat there often.
Note: I just found out that they usually have $1.99 shrimp tacos on Thursday. I must try them.</review>< Time>

It was my Family's last day of vacation at SEARANCH, and we decided to grab some lunch.  The place we normally go to was closed. So we decided to look for something new. We saw the sign for Antonio's Taco on hwy 1 and decided to try it.  There were six of us and we all enjoyed everything we had.  It's not a very large place. There are a couple outside tables, and apparently the locals like it. There were quite a few take out orders while we were there.So if you are looking for a change from fish and chips on the coast, I highly recommend Antonio's Tacos for great Mexican food.<//Text>

Great food!  Best Mexican food in the whole area.  They REALLY need to get a menu online or a take-out menu, though!< /Text>

Best most authentic mexican food on the north coast! Period! If you're  looking for good real mexican food, great salsa/chips then this is your place to stop. Friendly, accommodating service , albeit limited, and great take-out. Atmosphere is just a roadside diner joint. If you're looking for romantic, this isn't it. But for great mexican food, this is a must!</Text>

I would have had a great experience if the store shelves would have cat food  on them. No merchandise very limited to the expensive ones. Fancy feast no selection.</review>

They have a great cat rescue with multiple kitties to choose from!

The Doggie Day Care did not appear to be reopened yet but I could be wrong. Call first if you want to bring your dog to the doggie day care.

Nice employees. Lines got a little long when the store got suddenly crowed but it wasnt too bad.</Review>< name>

I brought my adopted dog Siscily, her owner passed away,  to be groomed at PetSmart. Her body needed to be shaved because of the matt's. Her facial hair was fine and I combed it every day and used barrett's, hair ties and bobby pins to add some style. When I went to pick her up I saw her on the table, but thought to myself that can't be my dog. The body was shaved, but there were random long pieces on still left on parts of her body and her face had been unevenly cut. She is a Cocker Spaniel Mix, ( Cockapoo ), but not anymore. She looks like a Poodle and then I I saw on her profile, that I created my groomer, ( Araceli ) , changed her breed to Poodle Miniature can you believe that, but I changed it back. There will be no more styling the front bangs for now and I AM SAD ! I will say the store manager was very kind to me when I went back to addresses my concerns and even gave Siscily a Dog Sweater at no charge and refunded the the $82.00 that I paid and for what I am not sure because no report card was given 😣<//Text>

<Text>Petsmart on Huntington Dr in Pasadena is located in a Mall. Plenty of parking and easy access. This place is larger than most I've visited in the past.  They have a grooming area, a small pet clinic and adoption station as well as everything else you'd expect. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. This was the neatest, best stocked and cleanest store I've ever seen.  Well done to the management and the team.</Text>< pictures>

curbside pickup for the win! It normally takes few hours from placing online order to curbside pickup. But once I arrive at curbside, staff comes out with my order within minutes. Fast staff!</text>

<Review>I love this location in Pasadena. So friendly and very professional. The PetSmart located at Alhambra is not so great. Most of the employees there are not friendly. Very cold, and poor service.<//Review><Date>1612607889300</Date><rating>5< /rating><userid>108647977113895530520< /userid><Name>Kim Chang</Name>< Gmap_id>

Lots of things to buy for your pet.
Only thing is I think all pets should be on a leash.< /text>

<review>The shelves are always empty of the Purina dog food. The employees told me they don't stock the shelves until after 1pm. Here's an idea petsmart, stock your shelves before you open so you stop wasting customers time and gas money. I'll take my $70 a month elsewhere I'm not coming back here.</review><user>112558360711289815843</user>< Pictures>

What a great store and staff! It's quite far from home, so I called in advance to make sure they had exactly what I needed. They were nice enough to check stock for me. When I arrived, someone immediately asked if he could help me find anything. When I told him what I needed, he said, "Oh, you called about that; right this way," took me to the correct aisle, and even loaded the big bag of food into my cart. When I thanked him, he said, "You're the reason we have jobs!" I thought I had time-traveled back to that kinder era when helpful service was common in stores. What a refreshing and pleasant experience. Kudos to a truly excellent staff! On a more practical note, parking was plentiful and easy. Overall great experience, and well worth the long drive!</Text>

PetSmart is my go to place for anything for my little friends. They get everything they need high quality, and I get to save a little in the process. The staff is friendly, attentive, and more that eager to help with your every need. Visit PetSmart in Hastings Village and you'll get exactly what you need.< /review>

PetSmart's online ordering with store curbside pickup was simple and quick.  I received a confirmation email the next morning with instructions, drove to my local PetSmart, called them and they brought my items right to my car. Way to go PetSmart.</Review>

I thought it was due to the lockdown, but they informed me they never closed, so they just come to work and allow their fush to remain in tanks sharing water with other tanks. Go to a real pet store, not a capitalist money grab. This is Pasadena. There are independent fish, bird, and feed stores EVERYWHERE! Resist corporate takeovers of our lives.< /Text>< Pictures>

As always, employees were friendly and helpful finding an item that had been discontinued,  and the new product that replaced it.  I've never had a bad experience at PetSmart, it's  my go-to for pet supplies.< /Text>

Very low stock. Often they are out of what I need. Prices on website are lower than in store. They should order and ship for free to your home like other stores do if they are going to continue to keep their stock low. Also prices are high compared to Amazon or target. Personnel is nice and store is clean.<//Text>

My review is based on my dogs grooming experience with Amber. She takes good care of my little one. She's gentle and gives her lots of tlc, helping ease her grooming anxiety.  Super grateful for her great work.</Text>

Tony is an amazing cat groomer. My cat is semi-feral, and she doesn't go near strangers. Tony was a able to give her a hair cut, a shampoo, and a nail trim. He is very caring and gentle with the cats. I can tell that he really cares about the animals and his job. I highly recommend Tony. He's the cat whisperer.</review>

This store is always clean and usually well stocked.
Just an FYI:
Currently, Purina/ Friskies canned cat food batch #s 1157, 1159, 1161 are very possibly tainted. Many cats have come up sick and or dead because of that food.
Be warned!<//Review>

<Text>Preferred over Petco simply bc they always have the brands that I'm looking for along with certain products for less that you just can't find anywhere else in person any longer. Great team of people, adoptions, it's a pets paradise so be sure to bring your bff with you. Who knows?! They might even be able to pick out their favorite toy for being so good 😊< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>The older white haired associate(I regret not remembering his name) was AMAZING! He was very informative in regards to grain free dog food and ingredients and made sure we got a food that perfectly fit our pups needs. This led us to purchase a new brand - the pet smart brand! Our pit bull LOVES it. Not only are we now saving money and getting our girl the nutrients she needs, but our pup is acting like this is her fav food! A big thank you to the associate that helped us. Truly a great asset to your team.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< pics>

My experience with PetSmart grooming was the worst... the older man who was supposed to cut my dogs nails was very untrained. He had my dog up on the table with the leash to high and to tight.... when I went to go tell the groomers that it was to tight someone rushed in and unhooked her by that time she had passed out and when I told them what happen to my dog they wouldn’t tell me what happen they just took her to Bandfield and I waited 10min until they took her out and the excuse they gave me that her heart is week and that’s why she passed out.... weird thing that’s her doctor who I’ve been taking her to for the past 10yr and he’s never told me her heart was week...<//Review>< pics>

Sometimes you need to wait for someone to help you, but that's during the busy times. I get my dog's groomed here as well and the pricing is better that Pet Co. They will help you to the car if you ask. In brand fish tanks are not the best for 2.5 gallon.<//review><rate>4</rate>< gmap_id>

<review>I used to like this place until what I experienced today. I work literally across the street and came in wearing my uniform after work. Nothing unusual there, that's a part of my normal routine. I was in the area where the guinea pigs are kept (makes sense since I have one and I got her from this location!) and went to the bedding. I was comparing the prices of bedding when I noticed a store associate come towards me. He was squinting at me mad hard. I used to work retail, I KNOW the drill. He did the usual polite question of asking if I needed help. I kindly responded that I was fine and was just browsing. I went back to what I was doing. About 5 or 10 minutes later, HE CAME BACK. Same thing. He would squint really hard at ne, stare at my cart as if he was checking to see what I was putting in it. This continued the whole time I was there and I'm disappointed beyond belief.

The whole ordeal was uncomfortable and unnecessary. Who would shoplift and steal, while wearing their WORK UNIFORM!?

Do better, PetSmart.

For fellow shoppers, avoid this location. They have an issue with profiling. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.< /review>< Pictures>

The store is so organized that it's easy to find what you're looking for. And if you can't find it, there's staff around to help you. Staff has been friendly & so helpful. And if you come in with your dog, you might end up buying more than you intended to! Lol<//Text>

< Review>
Terrible customer service. Came in on a Sunday afternoon looking to buy a starter fish kit and some fish. After waiting for help for about 10 minutes I went up to the front and requested help. The cashier told me to go back to fish dept. and someone would come help me. Even though I saw the cashier call for an associate over the PA no one ever came.

Headed back to cashier, repeated process. No one came.  By this point there were several families waiting for help with fish. After about 10 minutes a young lady finally showed up but instead of asking around she helped the first person in her line of sight. At this point (I had been there about 45 min) I got in my car and headed to Petco in La Cañada. The store is smaller and they don't have as much variety but, as soon as I came in, the store manager asked if I needed help and then spent about 30 min explaining the different types of fish and procedures necessary to start a new tank.

This was all probably for the best.</Review>

<Text>Great location and staff.  Stay away from the Moneovia pet hotel.  Day care staff is the best!  Jasmine and Terrence are always a pleasure.   The dog trainer is great, huge shout out to Armando!

Weekends are an event because of the adoption charities that come in.  Not unshoppable though and if you're looking to adopt a cat or dog, come here first.< /Text>< pics>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Used to be a 4 star review but updating today.  I just experienced one of the most outrageous examples of unprofessional behavior by a "manager" of a retail store.   I went into Petsmart today to buy crickets.  When I walked in the person who stands there greeting people said hello and if I needed anything.  I was talking to someone on the phone and I indicated I was OK. at that moment.  Eventually I would need crickets but I had other shopping to do first.   When I returned to the area where the Crickets were I stood there for quite some time. Other people were also walking up and down the aisles looking for assistance and one person had to go up to the registers to get someone to come back and help him near the turtle supplies.  I stood there for over 10 minutes and not one person showed up or check the area at all. I was not the only person waiting for assistance.

I got disgusted and decided to leave the store.  I have been shopping at this store for years.  As I was leaving the "manager" who I didn't know was the manager was near the entrance with other employees and I overheard him giving some direction to the employees.  I commented to him as I walked by without stopping, "maybe you should have someone come back and check on people standing around for over 10 minutes waiting to buy crickets"

I was walking at a brisk pace because now I had to drive another 7 miles to find somewhere that would be able to sell me crickets.   The manager came literally running out of the store to argue with me stating that "we tried to help you and when you came in you said you didn't need help".   I then told him that I didn't need help as I was walking through the doors and that doesn't excuse standing in a location for 10 minutes and being ignored.  For clarity I talk loudly as a baseline.  I am a veteran, and I have a fairly significant hearing loss so I tend to talk loud.  As I'm walking to my car this "manager" "Juan" continues to argue with me telling me that I'm yelling.  Which is irrelevant because I can yell all I want.  I'm outside walking to my car. There are no laws stating I can't yell.  I then turned around to him and stated that he hasn't heard me yell and than put on foghorn blast to make a point.   I was born and raised in New Jersey and worked with Adolescents for nearly 15 years.  I can be loud if necessary.

"Juan" continues to follow me to my car, literally trying to antagonize me and when I gave him a demonstration of yelling to provide clarity that my normal tone of voice is far from yelling he then starts telling me that he is calling the police and follows me to my car and starts taking pictures of my license plate.   I told him he can call anyone he wants.  There are no laws on the books that say I can't yell at "Juan".  This is part of the California entitled snowflake mentality.   Someone needs to put his big boy pants on and grow up.  I actually hope that he did call the police because his actions to which I have a witness were clearly intentional and  antagonistic. For him to follow me out of the store trying to create a conflict is outrageous.

As long as Petsmart employes him I will no longer be a customer. There are too many other places where I can shop to put up with childish unprofessional antics of a bruised ego of an incompetent manager.   In fact when I called the store from the parking lot before I left asking for the name of the manager it wasn't him at all.  He is not the manager.  He is the assistant manager.  I will absolutely be taking this to their corporate office on Monday.   I've dealt with a lot of nonsense from insurance companies and other organizations that think they have you over the barrel  I have never been confronted with a "manager" who conducted himself in such an unprofessional manner.

Juan is going to learn a lesson about conducting himself appropriately because I am going to make sure that this is broadcast from end of the planet to another.</review><username>DJJ Nonya< /username>< time>

PetSmart is merchandizing Friskies canned cat food in a most inconvenient manner now.  Instead of offering sealed cases, well-organized, they now haphazardly stuff the shelves with open cases, and the sealed cases are off in a corner with zero organization - everything stacked every which-way.  It is now quite difficult to select specific cases of cat food.  This brand only - the other brands remain well-merchandized and organized.  I would use the online-order with store-pickup service but, for the Pasadena store at least, getting the order right is challenging and after trying this with them a half-dozen times, I have given up and decided to come in to the store to make my selections and then check out the normal way.< /text>

<date>1471981261271<//date><rating>5< /rating><Text>I love this location and the staff is always friendly. We started going to PetSmart when we got our first dog. Angela is one of the best trainers we've worked with over the years. She taught our stubborn French Bulldog to listen and learn skills in a positive, safe and fun environment.  We did every training level with Angela. When we got our second Frenchy four years later, we brought him to be trained with Angela as well.  We plan to complete all training levels with our second dog.  We've gone in from time to time to get food or more toys and the staff always remembers our dogs names.  I don't know what we would have done without Angela over the years! Thank you!< /Text>< pics>

< review>
I saw an employee WALKING after a loose dog that was running through the busy parking lot. This employee was so unmotivated to catch this dog it was gross. The employee was holding the dogs leash and attached collar, and the dogs owner was crying at the front entrance as she watches her dog almost be hit by two different cars.

I felt compelled to tell the employee that he will never catch the dog if he doesn't walk over to it. Luckily another customer was willing to go after the dog since this employee couldn't be bothered.

Staff is friendly. Store is well stocked and maintained.  Used the groomers for the first time. Maybe it was because it was a weekend, but it took longer than it should have. 3 1/2 hours for the basic grooming service, no extras.< /Text>

I had taken a video of the dog daycare to show a friend who is looking for a place to take her dog a few days a week. Here is a conversation that happened as I put my phone away.

Dog daycare employee:
“Excuse me mam, we don’t mind you snapping a few photos but these are people’s pets.”

Me:
“Ok, they are animals its not human trafficking. Lets not get into a freak out.”

Btw-
Petsmart dog daycare is an entire wall that is a window so customers can look at the dogs. I’ll bet when the dog owner drops them off they are aware that dog privacy is not a part of the service.
Dogs pee, poop and sniff each other’s butts in public. I’m sure they will be fine if they get their picture taken.< /text>

WOW. I trusted you with my CHUWAWA Crissy Lopez. Yesterday 06/28/2016. Admit  she is having a problem with rolling on her back as if something is not right.  I have comprehensive care for her.  You, PetSmart should have noticed she has fleas... I looked today 06/29/2016, one day later. I actually paid paid forrservic and was scammed.  FOLKS, find a true vet. Not pet smart, I love my girl Chrissy. As u all love your pets.</review>

<text>I would put ZERO starts if I could.   My husband was falsely accused of stealing something today.  My husband attempted to return something (with a receipt) and the Manager accused him of either being an idiot (because my husband didn't notice the item was missing from the closed box) or of stealing because the manager found it unbelievable that somebody, including his staff, would miss that the box was empty.    We have been customers there for years (as should have been evident by looking at our purchasing history - which the manager claimed to have looked up).  This type of treatment is unacceptable.<//text></record>

(Translated by Google) There is a variety of products in the store, however the cashier was a little rude to give me my change, I practically threw coins for being Latina.

(Translated by Google) There are a lot of dogs that are in the back of the store, but I thought there would be a lot, and I wouldn't be worried if I had a place like this.
