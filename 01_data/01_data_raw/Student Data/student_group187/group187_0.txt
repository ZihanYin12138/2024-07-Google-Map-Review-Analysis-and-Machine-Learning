< review>
I’m from Modesto and we scheduled an appointment there because we were referred and told they were the best to align for bagged cars. So once we got to our appointment at 9:30am on a Monday there was no one there. We drove about an hour to get there and waited an hour more because we thought they were late. No, they were just closed. If they were professional we would’ve got a call a day or two before to let us know they were closed. We called the following day to let them know what happened and they said okay let’s schedule an appointment for that day. Turned out they called me back about 30 min later saying their technician is sick and out for the day. Like come on don’t you guys work at the same place? Is there no communication? They then asked if we wanted to schedule another appointment for another day and we kindly denied. Too bad I saw all these wonderful reviews and I was excited to get a job done from them. They really let us down. I’m pretty sure they are good! But please communicate with your customers and staff members. Let us know ahead of time if you guys are going to be closed or not for the day.< /review>

They got the job done but took a month and a half due to CarHop sending the wrong Parts supposably I will never know they also reviewed my car two times and said that they had found the problem which was a gas line leak when I told them that I needed new fuel injectors and which was the problem the whole time and they had to go review my car a third time to determine that was the problem and then call CarHop to replace it</Text>

< review>
I've never seen or heard of this shop before. I needed an alignment done on my car asap from just getting it back from a shop that installed some coilovers for me. I wanted to find a shop that would be able to perform an alignment on a lowered car. For one there were no other shops available to do so and couldn't take me without an appointment. I called johns shop and was welcomed there soon as I could get there. This shop is it man. Not only do they have a perfect alignment machine for lowered cars but the technicians there know what they are talking about and the shop is clean and makes you feel comfortable walking in. They found one of my control arms were busted. Told me they could have the parts there that day and have them installed for me with an alignment for a great price. I couldn't leave my car there. They hooked me up the best they could with an alignment to get by for the day and had me come in then next day. Boom showed up, dropped my car off, called me back when John said it would be done and I couldn't be any happier. Thank you John and the rest of the team there not only for being very professional but making me feel like I was part of the family and for also doing a fantastic job. I have any more problems this is my shop to go to.</review>

He was searching for the best shop all over California, when all this time, he should have never gone anywhere else...He could have just stayed here is Stockton this whole time.

Awesome shop with great and unique performance parts. The Staff are knowledgable, and give you their best, realistic advice. Some shops often times get bad reviews, simply because people do car upgrades on a limited budget, without addressing current issues with their cars. With that said, Autosport209 is well deserving of a 5 star review from me, based on my experience of their customer service, installation, and product knowledge.< /review>

My first experience with John was a good one, but after that it steadily got worse. John installed an air ride system into my car. I paid $3000.00 and was told by him that there may be some leaks here or there but that was to be expected. Three years later and $2000. more dollars the problem hasn't been resolved. John doesn't stand behind his work nor does he answer his phone. I would highly recommend that you take your hard earned money else where. John and his team really don't know what they are doing.</review>

i had them order me a stage 3 clutch and he said it would be 5 days. This was on  a monday. The following Friday he texts me n days it won't be until the next week on Wednesday or Thursday.
So I am very unhappy with their unprofessionalism and lies. Seems like they will say anything to get your money then once they do, it all changes.</review>

Pressures you into buying junk if he thinks you don't know cars or car parts.Super rude.Literally ordered the wrong rims for me, then told me a week later that he wasnt able to get the ones I originally wanted..but still wanted me to sign paperwork for financing
Owner John is ridiculously unprofessional.</text>

She is a stellar professional who knows her stuff! Office was professional, clean, respectful and very thorough! This is, by far, simply the best ophthalmologist I have ever seen!

Dr. Fram saved my eyesight… After having R K 30 years ago I needed a cornea transplant which Dr. Fram did an excellent job… Then I had cataracts in both eyes which doctor Fram also replaced with new lenses… I now have 20/25 vision!!! My optometrist said Dr. Fram is so ahead of her time in her knowledge of the eyes!!< /text>

<Review>My first visit to Advanced Vision Care was to establish a relationship for a future cataract surgery.
Not only was entire staff courteous and friendly but Dr Naids suggested 2 minute procedure to improve vision in my problematic right eye!  I am thrilled to report that the results exceeded my expectations and beyond!  Very very pleased with my entire experience.<//Review>< rating>

She took her time with me and explained the benefits of cataract surgery and how she will help me with my vision.  I trust her and know I am going to be well taken care of and anticipate a wonderful outcome.</Text><username>linda ruhland<//username>< resp>

Advance vision care is the most prestigious ophthalmologist office that I have ever been to. They are very caring, compassionate, and passionate about their work. Dr. Nicole Fram is an excellent physician when it comes to treating your vision. I truly appreciate all the hard work that she puts in to ensure that her patients are satisfied. Miss. Nicole Larsen is the one of the most welcoming practice administrators I have ever met, she clarified the whole process during my cataract surgery. Once again I truly appreciate all the hard work and effort they put in.<//review>

I have been seeing Dr Naids at Advanced Vision Care for several years now ever since I had an eye emergency that required me seeing an ophthalmologist rather than an optometrist. I have had a great experience with all of their staff in their office and with Dr Naids for my annual visits as well as surgery. I always feel like I’m getting professional, attentive, caring, cutting edge care. Never feel rushed or dismissed. I also love Simon who does my check in & refraction. He is charming, knowledgeable and always seems to go above and beyond discussing my current vision and prescription. I highly recommend them.< /Review>

Dr Fram is very competent and personable. I was there a long time for prep etc but  my procedure was quick;  I felt like I was treated well and had good professional care.  Where they could improve their service would be to give better instructions with regard to home care. I was told I would have floaters; I did not know how long they would last, how long to expect the dilation to last, and what restrictions I was expected to follow . At the time I didn't think to ask; it was after I returned home when the office was already closed that I realized I needed more direction. It's always a good idea to write down questions before arriving at any office, due to the fact that when going into any kind of procedure the brain is only focused on the immediate inconvenience; hence, clarity is limited. Because of Covid, my husband couldn't be in the waiting room. He was downstairs with no seating for over 2 hours and couldn't stay outside because at 6pm it was very cold. The important takeaway is that I received excellent professional care. Come with your own chair and a jacket.</review>< Rating>

Everyone is very friendly, patient and helpful.  The visit I had was an annual checkup 2 years post surgeries. Both of my surgeries were performed by Dr. Fram and my vision is amazing! I can see so much better than I have in years. I will never be able to express how grateful I am to Dr. Fram and the staff.  Yesterday I met Dr. Naids for the first time and he was as wonderful as Dr. Fram.  I love this office!<//Review>

I have had Dr. Fram do cataract surgery on my eyes with tremendous success. Recently I brought my 94 year old mother to live with me from Florida. She needed vision care so naturally I brought her to Dr. Fram. My mother does not give complements easily, but after her exam and consultation with Dr. Fram she told me that was the best and most through eye exam she ever had. We are very pleased to be in the care of Advanced Vision Care. Thank you Dr. Fram, Dr. Nades, Simon and the whole team!</review>< rating>

<text>I am a surgeon and, with over 40 years in practice, can recognize a high-quality practice. Dr. Fram and staff offer exceptional service to their patients. Appointments run on time and smoothly. Staff is attentive and professional. I learned that many staff members have been part of the practice for many years and that is emblematic of a good place to work and a good place to be a patient; veteran staff members know their jobs and do them well. Dr. Fram is a good communicator and very attentive.
Heartily endorse the practice; you will be well cared-for.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>My visit to see Dr. Fram was my first experience with AVC.  I arrived on time and the check in process was effortless and then I was introduced to her assistants, Paul and Hussan. who ran me through numerous eye tests and photos.  Everyone I met opened with an introduction and an explanation of the next steps and the purpose.    When the tests were complete, Dr. Fram came in and completed a comprehensive explanation of the results and what steps were to be taken and why.  My vision had undergone rapid changes this past year so it was good to hear a thorough explanation of the next course of action.  Before I left the office I had a complete report on the events of the day and a protocol for treatment.  I would not hesitate to recommend ADC and Dr. Nicole Fram to anyone else seeking help with eye care.</review><gmapID>0x80c2bbf24adbb6d3:0x20ea6bd5e270b4ea< /gmapID>< Resp>

I had an 8:00 a/m/ appointment and got there on time.  I had my temperature taken before I entered the waiting room and was told that I would have someone get me in a couple of minutes.  Within a couple of minutes I was taken to an exam room for my peripheral vision  test on a machine. everything was explained to me and I was handed a tester.  the whole test took about 15 minutes.  I was then told that Dr. Fram would get back to me with any results in a couple of days.  I can't remember the name of the employee who tested me but she was very professional.  I have never had a problem with anyone there since I started seeing Dr. Fram.</text>

During COVID we realized my cataract developed so much that my vision was awful and i had difficulty driving at night.  When all was safe, we scheduled the procedure (it was so easy and simple, i can't refer to it as a surgery).  Everyone was wonderful from Nicole, Dr. Fram's scheduling administrator, Dr. Naids, Dr. Santo and the entire staff who did measurements, taught me how to administer the never-ending drops, and the people at the surgical center.

He recommended her as a national level expert in the treatment of this condition.  Every resource I looked to confirmed  this assessment. I found her staff to be very pleasant, thorough and great at communicating instructions and recommendations. Dr. Fram performed surgery and from A to Z the process was seamless and efficient. Everyone from  the receptionist to the nurses to the anesthesiologist were kind and made an effort to provide assurance and comfort.

<review>I was referred to Dr. Fram by my previous ophtamologist and was impressed with the expertise of her and the staff. With the pre- and post-op appointments with my cataract surgery, I got acquainted with many of the them. Dr. Fram took time to understand the condition of my eyes, offered options, and fully explained each one and what was involved. Her personal interest made you feel comfortable and more than just another patient. The procedure for the Light Adjustable Lens was probably the most painless procedure I have ever had done. I would and have recommended Dr. Fram and the office to others.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Fram performed cataract surgery on me and I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome.  Not only her expertise and bedside manner but her professionalism in every aspect of her practice was 5 stars across the board. Also, her refractive technician, Simon is one of the nicest and most professional members in her office. I totally trust his ability and recommendations with respect to my eyewear and prescription.
I would highly and without reservation recommend Dr. Fram and her office staff.<//review>

Dr. Allaire is my dentist and my lifeline to oral health and well-being. He uses with the finest level of equipment and takes conscientious care into making sure your teeth are good  - he is second to none. I find it so very special that every time I have left his office, I have left with a smile on. my face due to the compassionate way I am treated at Allaire dental.  Allaire dental has a wonderful staff that includes Art who is a guru right at the front desk that handles your case and paperwork from start to finish.  I would be remiss not to make a special mention of the oral hygienist named Carrie.  She is amazing and possesses some type of magical powers where she can give shots in your mouth without you ever having felt a thing. They are all compassionate dental educators on the highest level and I highly recommend Allaire dental to care for you and your dental needs. You cannot pay for what they put into service like this!<//Review>

It’s been a long journey and everyone has helped me along the way.I was in an impossible situation and Dr. Fram has fixed no my vision with her exceptional skills. She is a genius.</Text>

Dr. Naids was my second opinion since I was not comfortable with the first practice I had a consultation with. Soon as I met this doctor and he explained in detail what to expect and not sugarcoating best case scenario - I knew this who I would trust to work on my eyes. The follow up appointments have been a good experience. My only criticism is the front staff lacks customer service and professionalism. When I speak or email Claire Murdoch she is cold and replies with “4pm” when I ask for latest appointment available. Then have to email again asking “what day next week is he available at 4pm?”  Then calls to let me know he can see me earlier and I explain “i asked for later appt since I can’t get off work before”
And end the conversation with “well, if you can get away early just let us know”. Haha; really?  Don’t expect full sentences from this lady. Other than that this practice is perfect.< /review>

I can't rave enough about Advanced Vision Care. Excellent facility with a great staff.
Dr. Steven Naids is my hero! I recently had surgery on both eyes and I couldn't be happier. He is truly an amazing doctor and an excellent surgeon who really cares about his patients. My opinion, best eye doctor on the planet! Thank you Dr. Naids for what you have done for me, even during this uncertain time we live in, everything seems beautiful with my new vision and that to me is priceless.
I also want to thank Nicole Larson, the Manager for AVC. She is one of the best people I have had the pleasure of meeting. Without Nicole's help, guidance and expertise I would never have had the courage to go through the surgery. She made sure I was comfortable and guided me throughout the process from pre to post and beyond with the utmost care. After surgery, I  had an issue with one of my eyes and was freaking out so I called the after hours exchange and they said someone will call me back. When I heard Nicoles voice on the other end, I felt so safe and calm as I knew she would know how to resolve my issue. Thank you Nicole for being so great.<//Text>

< Review>
Dr. Fram performed cataract surgery on my right eye.  This procedure, which employed a laser, went splendidly: I suffered no pain during the surgery and almost none post operative. My eye sight is almost perfect and in the future,  I expect to  see, if not like an eagle, than at least to have the powers of observation of a Sherlock Holmes!  I am extremely grateful to Dr. Fram and her support staff who demonstrated compassion and  technical skill laced with good humor.  Please thank them for me; they have enriched my life!</Review>

I made an appointment for a lasik consultation two months ago, because their earliest appointment was two months out. I just called, needing to cancel it. They told me that I didn't have an appointment in their system. If I had kept the appointment, taken the 4 hours off work and showed up, I would have been very disappointed. Glad I'm not giving this place my business.</Text>

After seeing two doctors that couldn't help me ...try this and in two weeks....  Over four weeks into a corneal ulcer the Dr Shami took the bull by the horns and it was day to day for two weeks before the eye began to clear up.

I was a new patient and explained my situation over the phone not recognizing the seriousiness of my problem and they asked if I could come in today?  The entire staff really cares to do their best.  People come from over the world to this clinnic and it's obvious why.

Actually Dr. Shani has moved her practice to over by UCLA, 1092 Wilshire Blvd just off the 405 freeway.<//text>

I had a noise in my car I was sure it was the belt and I came in and they just fixed it right away with no charge or anything. The bolts were just loose and when I asked how much I owed them they let me go with no charge. Great people and great place and I am a happy customer I will definitely be coming back<//text>

I was travelling to Los Angeles and my car broke down in Valencia.  I was towed to Ace Automotive thinking the worst and I remember Evan, the tow truck driver saying what a great mechanic Shy was over there and that he'd get me back on the road in no time, plus it was a Friday.  Evan wasn't lying!  Shy popped the hood and fiddled for like three minutes and knew exactly what the problem was.  He was able to fix it and get me back on the road under an hour.  He was kind, courteous, knowledgeable and quick!  And he was honest!  He easily could've taken advantage of me and my wallet as I was a stranger in town but he didn't.  The whole repair was under $100 and I was happy to pay him!  My car made it to its destination and all the way back home.  Shy even called me on Monday to make sure I returned safely and if everything was OK.  If live in Valencia or are ever stranded there by fate, do not hesitate to have your car towed to ACE AUTOMOTIVE!  I wish they were located here in Fresno as Shy would be my permanent mechanic for life!  Shy if you're reading this, thank you again and thank Evan the tow guy too - he was also honest with me and wise enough to tow me to you.  Wishing you and the business many successes.  ;)<//Review>

<review>Going to a trustworthy mechanic is as common as finding  a needle in a hey stack, finding SOMEBODY THAT that will shoot you straight on things is pretty rare i am a 23 yr old male that is pretty handy with most things i am  no mechanic but can fix the minor problems and i like to but against my own pride and ego and dealing with a busy schedule i took my truck in to the only mechanic my family and i trust they are  fixing my truck  as we speak but i cant  tell you how much of an awesome experience it is. My message is for anyone that is mechanically savvy or not, save yourself some time and bring it in to ace. Shy will always be more honest with you than anyone you know and shoot you great prices i am not someone to write reviews or beat my chest about service but this is just one of my simple ways of them thanking them for saving me time and stress its been a pleasure<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Shy and Steve are the only two mechanics I trust in Santa Clarita. Been working on my vehicles for 5 years now and have always treated me and my vehicles with respect. Prices are fair and competitive and all the parts they use come with a warranty.</Text>

My father sold cars for over 40 years, we’ve dealt with a lot of mechanics.  I’ve never dealt with a more honest more professional mechanic who truly wants to help.  He’s never overcharged, he’s helped my all of our cars.

Best mechanic in the SCV and all of Los Angeles!<//review>

Stopped by for a diagnostic after work , not knowing if I would have to wait , I didn’t have an appointment, But nope !!! My car was taken to the work area ASAP, maybe about 30 minutes or so I had some feed back about my car . Super easy to work with the owner and his coworker Steve, very nice & felt they were both honest with what they think about my car.  I will be going back when I’m ready to drop a new transmission in my car .<//review>

An honest mechanic, skip the dealer and deal with Shy to diagnose and fix your car quickly, fairly and get back on the road again. 2006 Mustang GT, and 2003 Chevy Tahoe. Excellent work and guidance.  BTW - I was teacher's pet in high school auto shop and former jet engine mechanic.  Enjoy your day!</Review>

<time>1372712388562< /time><rating>5<//rating><text>I Have a 2004 Dodge Durango that would crank but would not start until you press the gas pedal all the way down.  After spending $1500 at the dealer, who replaced the fuel pump, and the computer, the car was still not fixed, and the dealer told me they "could not replicate" the problem I complained about, even though the car was still doing the same thing.
A friend recommended ACE.  I took the car to Robert, and he found a leaking injector, fixed it quickly and at a very reasonable price.  The car works great.  I have taken all my cars to him for several years and he is honest and reasonable.  Glad I found him.< /text>< pictures>

Robert and Charlie are two great people who know how to fix cars right the first time. I have been a customer since they opened. They are so good at checking out the entire car for our family. Look no more this is where to take your GM car for repair.< /review>

<Review>IN SHORT:
I am VERY disappointed with ACE Automotive. Don't go there, especially for an estimate. They will charge you for doing nothing! I wanted to give them 2 stars because I think they had a good manner about them and were polite, if dismissive of what I thought might be wrong, but charging a customer for doing nothing is VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. It seems that the only month it might be safe to go there is July, when AAA comes by to give them a certificate assuring they have great customer service.

FULL STORY:
I was referred to Ace by Kiwi Motors down the street who did excellent work on my wife's Honda. Went in to Ace because my car was running a little rough and there was an oil leak and some door handles that needed to be replaced. I liked the guys when I first went in, they assured me that they would give the car a thorough look over and let me know what needed to be done. I had the car in by 8:00AM today to give them the maximum time to look it over. I let them know that I didn't have much money, only a few hundred to do repairs for an oil leak and maybe a few other things if they were affordable. I brought the new door handles I ordered online in with me. By 10:30, they called me back. I won't name names, but the person on the other end of the phone assured me that he had looked it over for half an hour: The rough idle was from old engine mounts. Replacing the door handles using the parts I had brought to them would cost me $175. He couldn't check on the oil leak because he would have to take the covers off to find out where it was and that would cost a lot in labor, but the operation was likely to involve a repair that would cost over $500. That was only to fix the one possible oil leak and timing belt, because it was bound to break and strand me if I didn't take care of it (My wife had a new timing belt put on her car at Kiwi for about $250). There would be an additional $150+ charge to do a valve-cover gasket replacement (A simple DIY operation, less than $50 for parts, oil and oil pan at any automotive supplier and about 30-45 minutes to do yourself). Then he told me that there was a problem with the BRAND NEW alternator that I had installed less than six months ago. He suggested that I needed an entirely new alternator, which would be over $175 for them to do with labor and parts, because there was a spark gap in the lug holding the lead into the alternator and he didn't want to touch it because it was hot. I immediately went to get my car, this sounded fishy...

I was charged $45 to get my key back for nothing besides some advice (I don't know what is laborious about driving my car into the port and looking under the hood for 20 minutes, probably less). I drove it home, replaced the washer and lug-nut holding the lead on the alternator. The lead was clean; there was no melted metal and no corrosion or whitening/blackening from sparking. Took me LESS than one minute to do everything. No more alternator light. Nothing wrong with alternator. Took the door panels off and replaced the door handles, replaced door panels. Less than 30 minutes to do both handles myself!

I called another local place (Big John's, THANK YOU) and asked them what they would charge for an estimate and a thorough look over of the car: Nothing. Estimates and inspections done for free. The guy even gave me advice on how to do some of the work myself. THAT is great customer service.<//Review><user_name>Paul Newland< /user_name><time>1381436776497</time><Rating>1</Rating><Response>None<//Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

We deeply recommend.< /Text>

<text>If you work in the area and need food, they're a good choice and cheap. They also have brown rice which is a surprising but welcome choice.< /text><gmap_id>0x80dd2cebd22253fb:0x988158d04a0a1517< /gmap_id></record>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I can only compare the food to a place like "Flame Broiler". This place is much much better and even cheaper. The chicken is fresh, delicious, and thick and juicy. The steak is the same. Quality cuts of meat. I eat here 2x a week for lunch, or whenever I can. Great family run joint.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2cebd22253fb:0x988158d04a0a1517< /Gmap_id></record>

I must say that I am absolutely happy with Absolute Auto Care service work done on my son’s red Mazda 3. I was rear ended with severe damage to the rear left that needed whole new axle, bumper, lights and lots of body work (see attached photo of before & after repairs). I called around asking for quotes and almost all of them quoted an arm and a leg. Some even refused saying it’s a done deal (totaled & not worth repairing). Only Danny from Absolute Auto gave a realistic & honest quote over the phone subject to actual diagnostics. His final quote after examining the car was within the original price range quoted. I met Cindy, the office manager who was a very sweet person with a big heart. When she knew I was paying out of pocket since my Insurance declined coverage, Cindy comforted me, offered to help reduce the cost promising a good quality work.  I also found out that it was her family run business and Danny was her son etc. I must admit Cindy and her family did keep their promise! The completed work was simply amazing, beyond my expectations. During the repairs process, Danny kept me updated by text messages and photos of work in progress! I thought that was real cool! I want to convey my deepest appreciation to Cindy, Danny, Spencer and entire Absolute Auto team (not forgetting their friendly dogs that kept my son company while waiting) They are my new family , a go to place for all repairs and body work. Their service and completed work reflect their honesty, pride and integrity Best of all, they give lifetime warranty on their work done!  I real breath of fresh air in today’s auto repair world of
scammers, liars and cut throats!< /review>

Absolute Auto Care has an auto care package that provides 8 oil changes within 2 yrs, many discounted auto services and several free services for an unbelievable deal on Groupon. That deal may not available now, but it introduced me to who I like to call," my personal mechanics."
They're polite, professional, honest & affordable. They work extra hard to earn your trust and business.
I had my brake pads replaced at an excellent price & am very satisfied with their work. My brakes work great & I know I paid less than any shop I called for a quote.
I feel I have a new "personal mechanic" for life.

I bought their whole plan on Groupon cause it seemed like a good deal. I needed an oil change and the price was unbeatable. Told me it would take 7-10 days to get the silly coupon packet in the mail. Took almost a month and a half. So I get the book and go to call to make an appt cause this place is 45+ minutes from my house. I call and call for about a week and a half and not once does someone answer the phone. Finally I'm frustrated and I decide to go in person. I get there and the lady behind the counter is extremely rude. Didn't even apologize for the lack of answering a phone call the idk 15 or so times I tried to call over the week and a half. So whatever I tell her I want to make an appointment thinking I'd come back later in the week. She proceeds to tell me they are booked until May 21st...uh why would I make a two month from now appointment for an oil change? I'll be attempting to get a refund tomorrow. We will see if they will refund it cause Groupon sure won't. Should have just gone somewhere else but had to try to get a deal. I will never book am oil change months in advance. Who even does that?< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp></record>

Do not get work done here especially if it’s restoring an older car. Pics you see from others are likely friends. 10K later we will never do business with them again. They are full of excuses and time delays.<//Text>

<Text>I waited two years to write this review so here goes. I've started going to this place around 2013 for oil changes. I've taken my Boxster, 911, and Maxima. In 3/27/2018 I took my 911 for the standard oil change. I provided the oil and the special Porsche specific oil filter. When I picked up the car, I was told that the oil filter was wrong. I thought it was weird because I was 99% sure it was the correct filter. I went home and checked by doing the filter change myself. It fit perfectly. Not only that, the oil drain bolt was almost stripped. I don't trust them anymore.< /Text><Date>1606597305480</Date><user>110286665375442689498</user><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rating>

< Review>
My car had stopped and the engine would not turn over. I had my car towed over to Absolute Auto Care spoke to Cindy, she was very knowledgeable of what the problem might be.  She called back and told me they found the problem it was my ignition that was tied to the computer of the car that was not functioning properly.  She said that they could replace it but, i would have to go to the dealership to have it programmed. I also spoke with Sean he was very polite and professional in explaining in detail what they found through their diagnosis of the car. Even though they did not repair my car they still showed great care and professionalism. I definitely recommend this place to take your car for service or repairs.</Review>

I recently needed a quick repair on my truck after the engine shut off while I was on the highway. Absolute Auto Care was available and had my car repaired and ready to drive within 24-hours. They were considerate of my time and communicative. My only notes:

1) The location is hidden. It is at the back of the property.

2) Their two dogs (Dusty and Sable, I believe) approached me while I was retrieving my vehicle. While Dusty (pitbull mix) approached gently, Sable (doberman mix) was much more wary, approaching with some barking and an accelerated speed. Both dogs were VERY NICE and sweet, but I can see how some individuals might feel overwhelmed if they are not comfortable with strange dogs approaching in this manner. Please use this as a word of caution if you are cynophobic (fear of dogs).< /Review>

Knew this shop because of a good deal off groupon. You need to have an appointment before things start. The recepionist is courteous and accommodating and very easy to talk to especially for rescheduling appointments. They have a waiting area and kids have theirs too. Though there's not enough entertainment here but there's free wifi to use. Also sharing common restroom for your needs. They deliver on time and make sure that your car was dealt with, a mat of appreciation of our business receives you as you go with your car (unlike other dealerships, how it came in comes out the same). They provide maintenance, repairs, upholstery, marine repair (jetski), restorations, paint jobs and insurance claims!< /text>

Need to work on their Customers Service.  Need to work on their communication with customers. I was afraid to ask question about my own  car. Kept getting into arguments for simple questions i asked. Almost forgot the ad  said free diagnostic, then get to shop then its oh we gotta charge because of this... I think they call it bait and switch.</review>

My grandson first referred me here. I have received such great customer service and expert repairs to my Camry. Repair prices are always in line...I always feel treated fairly...the personnel there are knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend them to anyone who has been taken advantage of by other repair shops.< /Text>

Purchased a oil change deal from Groupon. Have had 2 services since then. They are really quick.  This last visit was especially fast yet sadly they failed to wash the windshield as was documented on the receipt.  I will continue to do business with this company, the price is right. Was greated quickly when we arrived.</review>

I have enjoyed each experience at Absolute Auto Care. I service my company vehicles, my personal vehicles and (as every parent knows) my adult children's. They always return your vehicle just as clean as you brought it to them. You will love Cindy's pets, of which, will soak up all the attention you can give them. Though, they are busy, it is worth the wait, they are timely and friendly. And there are times you can call to service your vehicle, upon another customer's cancellation. I been servicing with them going on 4yrs. And ypu will too.< /text>

This is one of the only two places I take my car to in Sacramento. Honest, quick and cost effective. They have great prices and on top of that occasionally they will have a deal on Groupon that’s got some incredible discounts.< /text>

<Text>Earlier this month I made an appointment to get my wife's MDX serviced. They told me to bring it in by 8:45am and we arrived on time walked into the office and the front desk lady gave me a rude tone stating they weren't even open yet. So I sent my wife in and for some reason the tone changes with her. After having the car serviced a week later her car was running really rough on her way too work and I found out that someone intentionally unclipped the fuel injector, leaving it loose to easily pop off. Other than that, I don't think they even did the valve adjustment we've ask for!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmap_id>0x809ac7553ecd23a5:0xb6aa2ce5db9401c4< /gmap_id><username>JonMac< /username><rating>1<//rating></record>

<Review>This is a team you can trust and a price you can afford. I drive for a living and I found these guys about a year-and-a-half ago, since then I have replaced axles, sensors, tires, lights, seals, oil leak, and a whole transmission, nothing broke the bank and everything was done with care and expedience. If you need a repair shop that does just about everything I would recommend them.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Nice family atmosphere. Had my car there for 9 years . Wish things had of went better for the 15,000 I spent . They mean well . You have to stay on top of them and what you want. I have to redo my entire care all over my paint ,my interior , work to the engine  , brakes and new entire audio system that wasn’t reinstalled after interior was completed. Very disappointed and yes I got screwed but I was doing a long distance request were I wasn’t able to make sure my car was right . This car meant a lot to me and when it was shipped to me . I was lost didn’t understand where I went wrong to deserve what I received. Lessons learned all in all I like the people there and I trusted them . Don’t make the mistakes I made never trust anyone make sure you stay on top of your car ask for all old parts look at what you paid for before leaving the shop. I will say this they did take care of my car as far as storage. Cindy was good to me  as well . Yeah I got screwed but I can move on start over and be smarter .</Text>

We had been lead down the wrong path by several mechanics with our older  F 150 truck until Shaun & Cindy helped us.  They were honest, timely, made great suggestions on how to head off future problems,  and reasonably priced.   If I could give then 6 stars, I would.  A quality shop you can trust, and no I'm not a relative.< /Text>

A wonderful shop. Shop owner Danny and his team can do anyting. Wonderful, honest, family-owned business. I have a 1952 Chevrolet styleline Deluxe that has had some remarkable restoration done at this location. I highly recommend this shop to any person/business for any restoration type work. This shop can get the job done. 👍< /Review>

The most honest shop I've ever been to. Cindy was extremely helpful and nice, explained everything thoroughly. This shop does not try to get you to spend more money like others I've been to. I will come here in future if I ever need anymore work done. Best prices in town (i called 9 other shops, seriously) and A+ work!< /Review>

When I walked in I was greeted by Cindy and her adorable pup. Came in because my car was making all kinds of noises. Wasn't there long when they told me what was wrong and how much it would cost(which was MUCH less than I thought I'd have to pay). Cindy was very helpful, I knew what she was talking about since she used to work on cars herself, my whole experience at Absolute Auto Care was amazing and I would recommend this place to anyone!</text>

I usually go to my manufacturer for service. I was tight on money this month, but needed my car looked at immediately due to not planning ahead. I found AAC on-line. I am very happy their work, prices, and quality of staff! There phone was ringing off the hook the whole time I was there. They managed to help in-store and phone clients with a smile, and an inviting attitude. They patiently explained my options, so even I could understand.There were no hidden fees. I am going back for my $24.99 oil change for sure!  If you want quality work and fair prices, go see Danny!< /Review>

<review>First motor blew up on the the way home. To make it right they said they had another that would rebuild if I paid for the parts. It was never balanced and had alot of vibrations. I had it taken to a machine shop and guess what never rebuilt never balanced and now I need a motor again. Cost me thousands. If you want skilled labor dont go here.<//review>< pictures>

I took my truck to Absolute Auto to have a oil change. They mistakenly thought my daughters car and mine were the same she was going to take her car for a oil change and tune up mine was just a oil change. My wife waited hours and finally asked them what is taking so long. They said they were having problems with the tuneup. She said what tune up this was supposed to be a oil change. She went on to tell them the tuneup was my daughters car the next day. They charged me anyways because my wife did not look at the work order. I got the truck back and it was running terrible. 2 days later the Truck started screeching turned off the truck and the engine was hard to turn over. Had the truck towed to my house. My friend who has been a mechanic for years pulled the oil filter and oil pan. We found what looked like thick greasy substance in the oil filter and in the oil pickup screen pipe was plugged with this stuff. I contacted the BBB and filed a complaint to no avail. I am disabled right since 12-02-14 so money is tight. I did not know about the burial of auto motive repair until today 7-13-17 I took my engine to CasCar to have the crank spun and new bearings today the truck has sat for well over a year. There are maybe 20 miles from the day of the oil change to the day it had to be towed home. I am writing this complaint in hope of you helping me but moving forward as if you cant help me like the BBB did.<//text>

<text>Great idea! I like that I didn't have to take my mother-in-law's Jeep somewhere. But I had a list of things for them to specifically tackle. I gave the list of things I wanted to make sure got done to the receptionist and hand wrote a note and left it inside for them to see. None of the things I asked, got done. The cleaning looked like it was completed in less than an hour. Granted a Jeep isn't a huge vehicle but streaks on the inside of the windows, Dust on the dash board and the wheels looked like they hadn't been touched. Not worth the $$ in my opinion<//text>< GmapID>

Probably time for a name change. There isn’t any luxury left at this outlet mall, and not even any real outlet stores.

This is just another strip mall in Mammoth at this point.

It was a good spot to catch the 4th of July parade from.< /text>

I'm not sure how a Bass outlet, a souvenir shop and a good coffee, wine and beer bar make up a luxury outlet...But whatever. The souvenir shop is good and Black Velvet brews a good cup of Joe and if you need you weed you can grab that Asent in the same parking lot. Also food and beer at Liberty Bar, good food, good staff and good libation selection.< /Text>

<review>I rented a van here in 2016. Then in 2020 to help a friend. Both rentals were with full disclosure and I paid what I expected. Remember that miles are computed after return, at check out only 20 miles are estimated in the quote or initial charge. I suggest you be efficient in your move and refuel the van back to what it was when you bring it back.</review>< pics>

< review>
Not the greatest experience at all. I went here thinking that all I needed to do was rent my truck, per usual, and be gone. First, the rude woman at the front desk told me that I could not use a debit card at her location at all.

Upon questioning her further, she been clarified that I could not use a debit card if I was renting out a van, but if I wanted to use the truck, I could use my debit card for that.

Any customer service rep that works for U-Haul could look at my account and easily tell this woman that I have never paid a $100 security deposit for renting a U-Haul Van. However, that's what she insisted that I needed to do, I needed to pay $100 security deposit.

She then try to Hard Sell the insurance for the U-Haul, claiming that I would need it for the rain, because the drivers on the road get crazy when it rains. Once I told her that I couldn't do $100, she didn't even care if I left out of the store or not.

I immediately called another location, and they charged my debit card $47 for the entire fee, before I even made it to their location. They clearly need better customer service agent at this location.

However, if it's not broke, they don't need to fix it. I would NOT highly recommend this place to anyone that I know. There are enough attitude in Los Angeles, why do I need to come here or send my friends here to experience that?</review>

I definitely recommend this spot for DTLA U-Haul services!< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Worst customer service /counter help!! Rude, lazy and lacking interpersonal skills. Wanted to rent a furniture dolly and I was told I needed to rent a truck to get the dolly. Wrong!! I rented a furniture dolly from the same location last year. There are other UHaul locations in LA.</Review>< Pics>

I have been to a lot of U-Hauls, and this one is the best by far.

Really well run, great customer service, friendly and really go above and beyond to help you.

I had an issue with my wiring for a trailer and one of the associates called his friend to see if they could squeeze me in to get it fixed last minute.

My plans would have been completely ruined had he not gone above and beyond to help me out!

Really appreciate these folks and how they do business!</Text>

<Text>Unprofessional, uninterested, and unqualified. I literally watched one of the foul mouthed employees back a truck into another employee who was standing in the lot while I waited for any of the 6 or 7 employees here to notice me in the 15’ truck I’d pulled up in to return. It pains me to give these people money and support this awful place. I highly recommend seeking these services elsewhere.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Don’t bother using express check-in, still had to wait in line for an extra 30 minutes because they didn’t properly assign a piece of equipment to the reservation. Don’t advertise a service and then not properly train your employees about it.

Also to have one checkin employee during peak hours isn’t fair to the employee or to customers.< /Review>

I'm not exactly sure if Yolanda the store manager still works there but she makes the entire U-Haul experience much better. Othereise the storage space is spacious and other staff are very helpful. I cant comment on price as I haven't compared it with other storage facilities around LA.</text>

The only issue I have is they put a second lock on your unit and you have to trade ur license to get the second key making more time to get what you need to do.  Also the halls are very dim so bring a head lamp or flashlight...employee's are nice.  Parking sucks.  Only entry to move stuff is a loading dock.< /Text>

<rate>2< /rate><Text>Staff was very friendly and helpful. But the facility itself was very disappointing, so much so that I ended up moving into a different storage provider at the last minute after seeing the space. Chain link fence dividers do not instill much confidence in the security and safety of one`s belongings nor do the large rat traps in each storage space.  Access hours are limited, but what`s worse is the single loading dock which makes it nearly impossible to load/unload at the same time as anyone else.

Unfortunately I can't recommend this facility.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp><userid>100782475453775731593< /userid><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1433267463075</Date>< username>

<resp>None</resp><review>The truck was given to me with less than a quarter tank (what the paper stated) and a battery warning. The truck had gas light come on from only 15 miles being driven. I filled with more gas than I used and the group did not ever send me a receipt, only because I checked my credit card statement did I notice that they charged me an extra $25 for no reason. I called Uhaul and they said the reps from this location would be in contact with me and I have yet to receive a call. Very disappointed.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

Very unprofessional. Fictitious charges two weeks after rental was returned. Expected a refund within 2 business days, instead was charged a second time for the exact same thing. Impossible to reach a Supervisor. NEVER will I do business with this company again!</text>

<Review>I had a reservation here and had a really bad customer expierience with the manager there? can you believe a manager this bad? with an attitude?  WOW i'm never renting from uhaul again and i hope they get rid of this woman...... I just found out her name, Yolanda i had called earlier and i asked her what her name was and she just left me on hold of course she did it afraid of my complaint. I can see in all these reviews that i'm not the only one complaining about her and uhaul has done nothing to resolve this woman's problem.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

There is just one person to sign people up and help. And the process is excruciatingly slow. We had a 9 am reservation with 3 people ahead of us. Our reservation automatically updated to 10 and we finally got our confirmation done and ready by around 11.< /Review>

<review>I wish i could give this place no starz. YOLANDA MARTINEZ IS VERY RUDE AND THEY ARE THIEVES. I rented the truck from 8/1 @ 9am to 8/2 -@ 9am yet Ive been overly charged for 3 days. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM UNLESS YOU'RE HISPANIC THEN THEY JUST MIGHT NOT ROB YOU.  PAY CASH SO THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO YOUR BANK.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

< review>
My husband is currently at the location, he was told he could have a storage room with the first month free. It's been two days of run  around, no storage and I am currently listening to the owner Yolanda yelling at my husband due to a mistake she made in booking. I will be calling Corporate  and filing a complaint. Yolanda is very rude and very unprofessional.< /review>

(Translated by Google) A very poor service I had to move in an emergency and I went to look for a truck and as they did not have in all Los Angeles they told me to call customer service where they did not give me. Security that I could rent one they were going to mark me until the next day to see if in a case it would be better to look for someone else to move my things if they know that there is a lot of demand in the move they should have more trucks is my opinion

(Original)
Un servicio muy pobre yo me tuve que mudar de emergencia y fui a buscar un camión y según no tenían en todos los angeles me dijieron que llamara al servicio al cliente donde no me dieron. Seguridad que podía alquilar uno me iban a marcar hasta el siguiente día para ver si en un caso havia mejor busque a alguien más para mover mis cosas si saben que hay bastante demanda en la mudanza deverian de tener más camiones es mi opinión</Text>

<name>Michael Frazier<//name><time>1617648966443<//time><Rate>1</Rate><review>Horrible experience. I have no idea how they are still in business. We bought a 2020 35' Class A motorhome from them. We noted issues prior to purchase like a cracked windshield, dented bay door, etc. We were assured they would take care of everything. We made an extensive list when we picked it up and put it on the due bill. We are at a year and a half and have not been able to get it in for service. They refuse to set a day and time- and do not return calls. They now say we are out of warranty even though they are the ones that pushed us beyond coverage. After we signed the service manager hit the coach with a forklift. They said they would take care of it- but have yet to repair anything. We will be seeing them in court!</review>< Pics>

UPDATE: HAD TO REPORT THEM TO BBB ( Better Business Bureau) for not  Honoring extended warranty and repair service request

not buy from them!  Lacking customer service... Need help with customer service, needs a customer service program in place. Last year my family and I bought a 2017 Keystone  Springdale... From the 1st moment we hook the trailer up to water the toilet  leak and is still leaking a year later.  We still have factory warranties we also have extended warranty...  We had made phone calls I have place emails.... And today my  Toilet is still leaking water my kitchen is leaking water...  Can I use the sink because water is leaking underneath my refrigerator only works off of gas not like electricity...  I feel like I need to call the consumer affairs.  Under the sink it has tape where the sink has cracks.

We bought a new travel trailer from this business in May of 2020 with a 1 yeay factory warranty. Now in August they refuse to honor the warranty "because they got rid of their warranty dept because of Covid19" yet they were sure able to sell it to us during Covid19!. We know they have a booming business. All other rv dealers will only service their own sales because they are so busy. The factory says to go to your sales dealer. We have been left with a worthless piece of junk.  WE WILL BE SEEKING OTHER RECOURSE!< /Review>< Pics>

I want to comment on how rude the service was today. Simple questions to test the equipment on a trailer and denied. If I wasn't going to buy anything I needed to leave. He told me I would find out if the appliances worked when I took it home. Unacceptable. The owner, Mr. David V. Just didn't want to be bothered. Im very disappointed in this small town business. Never shop there if you want to be treated like dirt.<//review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>I’ll spare you the details, sales guy knows all the right stuff to say when it comes to honing in on a sale with zero sense about how to treat people. Every second of talking to him was excruciating. Told me (in a very wordy way blaming everything and everyone) he needs to know exactly what I want before I look at it. After I caught on to the attitude I told him plainly, specifically what I would like him to open for me. He walked away, came back, opened them, walked away again, no words exchanged, no smile, nothing. A personal friend told me not to go here because of the service, I went anyway, not wanting to prejudge and I came to my own conclusion. Before I left I told the sales rep that
I’m leaving because of his attitude and I didn’t feel welcomed. He told me that I was “lost and should go to an RV show if I wanted options to look at”. But no aknowledgemnt of the attitude, or for that matter even a reason for it.</Text><Name>Sasha Shkurkin<//Name><Date>1594425672424< /Date>< userid>

Went twice now to look at recreational vehicles there and twice now I had David as the sales associate and he is very rude and doesn't want to waste his time showing you anything. He only wants to help you if your a serious buyer he's very lazy and a bad sales associate don't know why he is there. I will not ever go back to there facility to buy anything from them.</review>

One of the best RV Dealerships I have been at! Great inventory to choose from and friendly salesman. Went in there to look at a couple of FW and ended up purchasing one at a great price that I could not decline!</text>

<review>Heads up if you are shopping for an RV in Atascadero,  Ca. Horrible dealership there. Once you drive your brand new unit off lot that's it!!!  They're done with you!. No return calls or emails. No time to check problems & schedule repair appointment. Final walk through guy had very little knowledge of unit  features. Their service department down the street from them totally ignored our request for a service appointment. No returned phone calls. Had new unit six weeks & couldn't use it. Finally the owner of the manufacture factory personally called us & we took unit down for repairs. Great group of guys.  Owner give hours of his total attention & kindness to us. Repaired & addressed our issues plus more. Toured factory 😁 Thank you PCW.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<rate>1</rate><review>We purchased a new pull trailer from Pacific Coast RV.  This was our first purchase and unfortunately our experience has not been pleasant.  Here are 4 reasons why we would not purchase anything from this place in the future.

1) Pacific Coast RV did not stick to the agreed upon pick up time.  They called 10 minutes before our scheduled time which was inconvenient since we had driven 2 hours to get there.

2) After waiting until late in the afternoon, the trailer that was presented to us at pickup was not the same trailer we had agreed to purchase the previous week.   The main issue was it was missing 4 key features and was a different floor plan.  They agreed to order and install them.  Many months later, this work still has not been done.

3) Once the purchase was made, it has been a nightmare.  After months of no action, I contacted the manufacture twice where they informed me any of this work would void some or all aspects of the warranty and they did not recommend the work occurring.

4) Craig (the service manager) is very good about returning phone calls but I found it never resulted in any action.

*  During the walkthrough, we noted there were missing light covers.  Craig said he would mail them to us the next week.  Despite numerous phone calls over several months (call that were always returned), we never received the covers.
*  Craig was supposed to mail us the users manuals and warranty information.  We never received them from PC RV.  Several months later, we eventually contacted the manufacturer who emailed them to us that day.

Buyer beware!  Go somewhere else.<//review>< pictures>

Rudest service. Don’t go here. Made an appointment to see rv. Drove all the way from out of town and when we got there they had sold it to someone else. No honor. No respect for others.< /review>

We received the rudest service I have ever,ever experienced.  When we pointed out major water damage to a unit they weren't the least bit concerned and basically ended their THREE of customer service reps being very hostile with us.  We want to warn shoppers of their shady practices. They have no interest in selling quality used units. I have been buying used units for many years and was absolutely shocked by the unprofessional manner. What a true disappointment as I planned on making a rather large  purchase, buying two separate trailers from them. BBB is my next call.</text>

The owner and staff at Pacific Coast RV couldn't have been more responsive to our needs in a recent transaction.  They collectively worked together, as a team, and are very happy to go above and beyond on your behalf.  Special thanks to Vance and to also to Shawn Brewer, Owner, and his entire Pacific Coast RV Team.</text>

My wife and I purchased a 2015 R Pod from Pacific Coastal RV.   Although we have experienced a few problems with the trailer, each issue has been
professional handled to our satisfaction by Craig and his techs.   I have
found Craig to always be available to answer my questions regardless of the subject matter.   We would buy another trailer from this facility based largely on the service we have received from staff, especially Craig.</Text>

We drove to Atascadero from Beaumont to View a 2018 40ft Big Horn 5th wheel in February 2018. We sent the full payment a few days later and drove back after the PDI. When we showed up to pick up the unit, the right side panel was damaged. We were reluctant to take the unit with this damage. David the sales manager assured us that the panel would be ordered and replaced. I called a week later and talked to the Service manager. He told me the panel was on order. I called every week and was told the same thing. Then after waiting till June I called again only to find out that the service manager no longer works there and the panel was not ordered. I have now called twice more. $68,000 on a new unit that was damaged by employees at this Dealer and they do not want to take responsibility.<//text>

I'm changing my review after our purchase was complete.  To start out every single employee was nothing but friendly and helpful!  The owner was onsite and just seemed like someone you would want to be friends with.  We did our financing through them and it was fast and easy.  We even had our 1 year old and 3 year old sit with us while we went through the process.  Fast forward...  Once we purchased our trailer we were treated like second class citizens.  Customer service was terrible and they ended up selling us a trailer that was to big for our truck.</text>

I was asked by Pacific Coast RV's lawyer on May 17th, 2016 to "cease and desist" regarding my past review and experience with their company and it's employees.  I was asked to remove the post not because it was non-factual, but because I called them a name that to me represented the way I was treated by their company. I was born and raised in San Luis Obispo County, where I was taught the meaning of your "word" and a hand shake, because that is something that people judge you by.  It's too bad that others don't realize how important that is in a "large" but still very small community as ours. (The one star rating is given only because without it I couldn't post my review.)<//review>

I had a poor experience with the manager here on Tuesday this week. I had to take a breathe due to being out of breathe with having to walk in my WALKER from Vicenzio's to your lovely store. After putting my mask down for 5 SECONDS he asked me to put it back on with NO ONE ELSE IN THE STORE.

I am all for safety but this is ridiculous. I would have spent a lot of money at the store that night. Give a lady a break that is in a walker and needs a moment to breath for God's sake!

The county of riverside is not going to shut you down for a lady taking off her mask for a moment!</review>

This place has it all! Knowledgeable staff, huge selection and great prices.
Even the male staff was really respectful and everyone is eager to help you. In Lake Elsinore, this place is a GEM! Everything is well lit and clean. I was educated on lubricants and special cleaning for my seductive purchase ;)
You can tell the employees are treated well, they are always so happy and they never come off too sales pitchy...( I even asked if they were commissioned AND THEY ARENT!)
Plus, they’re rewards program is where it’s at! Whenever I come in, I always have some points to use toward a good discount. I’m happy to say I’m a regular here.<//Text>

Poor mans/womans Adam&Eve. Movie selection was awful, clothing selection was almost good, and toy selection was adequate.</review>

A few high-end products, but mostly stock the cheaper "novelty" items for everything beyond vibrators - almost all from CalExotics - so not much variety. I'd suggest calling ahead if you're looking for something specific.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Great Store. I have been to many from San Diego to Las Vegas and this is by far the most laid back place ever. Most other places make you feel uneasy by following you around. Others have squat for a selection. This is quite, helpful and knowledgeable establishment with a friendly staff. The only thing that I do not like (and it is very miniscule)  is the fact that they do not give "Veterans" Discounts. Only active duty personnel (Some of us did not get to stay in and not by choice. But that is a topic better suited to a owner decision I don't do there books to see if it is freezable.
Other then that minor thing I love the place</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Coming here is like visiting you uncles who weren't expecting your company but they have to feed you since you're family and that's the mood of this place.

Food hits the spot when it's cold out and you've been hungry all day. Loved the side dishes and they kept refilling them without us having to ask. Hot plate of squid and pork was delicious, and we got an army stew for 3 for 4 people and there was so much food left. Seafood pancake was just ok, needs to have a but more flavor.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpR1hAQ4HsEW1vc0oBnWw50Il-dxBAqlbUJDw7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtdhwU53aXfqp6p8E59oQ3LP79n6ilhoTMtv9s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwQvqffgEdSRKakvdThu3GNC2wV_1B1ouOoKyR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHvco_tE7mun-DyP_Xq1I7iWTB5yxS9xRZDyDH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOk37QdDxOzTcFWeOAAhNf5M27Y0XcWyGC_YebB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfFwzwLDBdouMI5ZkkESPVFBDFhE8a3F-I-dk1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqgtwEW4ZjCfU5bt9IMVqN0zcoPoJaEh0Fs29i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfdumiTErqGYmzhpNym3xTwio8P_xA0sNaMOYD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoIwUCGUIZVag2zeb9HVg4WlONM-ym9KlFJE4d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhz68JKuLu2M1mjhn9P11RRw5_E0czb5aK5VvF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq_u_5XKbwwvIwU6NDPtSkN3n4cqUZd8bfOUtw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB045046pGoPcQaj8lBcMlj0mOT2pRgNwzO1Hu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlE3cGS0Gzb-bkQDAJm8hyz3tmF8EzJLnkVMOw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV1ffHZyPGZSQ22Io_-k01WsJHDCBsqJym6-U8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6x7tAZf0T5DlZPC044EKjaI2r_72FDVcccDGk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuZp20dq_UIu425hDWDhRa9BuG1MIsUNS-0dPt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO38Gf3kvo3irHB2k2Oed9486b3-Gts8YTAqjSN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Portion size. YUP. Unlimited Ban Chan. YUP. Great for my sick friend. YUP.

We wanted army stew, and looked for places around us. This happens to be one of the many few places(in the area) that actually have this stew, in comparison to all the existing kbbq places.

We got the hot pot - Base Army Stew(w/ serving size for two) and we were absolutely demolished. If you consider the ban chan and the red bean rice they give you, that's an insane amount of food that I think could have filled up to 3, maybe even 4 people.

They did not skip out on the sausage at all, and they have fish cake for sides. Tons and tons of protein!

This is a hole in the wall gem that blessed my sick friend's sinuses, maybe it'll gain more popularity as army stew becomes as popular as Korean barbecue.<//review>

<review>I love this spot! They have tasty food, their menu is varied, The chief cook in that restaurant is a professional, I like a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are always good, the service towards the customers  is friendly. I visit often this place and I was never discontended.

<rate>4< /rate><Review>This place is a small local Korean restaurant that serves very basic, but hearty food. These types of restaurants are tradition for many Korean families who simply don't want to cook that day. The army stew is very cheap and tastes great. You won't get a value item like this in many American places so just give it a try. The food comes out fast but don't go into Korean restaurants expecting the best service. The best service is relative because there are different styles of what is good. In Korea, the style of good service is to not bother the table unless they call for you. I personally don't like cheese in my army stew because it makes the soup too creamy, but if you like creaminess cheese is the way to go. Other than this, I can see myself coming back.< /Review>< userid>

Nice little restaurant. The food is delicious unless you hate spiciness. The interior may seem super basic but clean. Oh one thing, *everything is in Korean* so you probably wanna know how to speak that, or just like me, bring a friend who speaks that fluently.<//Text>

Pretty nice Korean restaurant.
Had goat stew and finished the whole bowl although it was a large portion.
Will be back again and try other dishes on the menu.
Overall experience was good and nice people.<//Text>

Not a fancy place where you want to take your gf or guest and be impressed by it (There is KyungBokKung for that). Having said that, this place is very traditional and casual Korean eatery at its finest. Price is pretty affordable and service is very friendly.< /text>

<Text>I discovered their herbal rice from a recommendation by my acupuncturist. They serve a dish that I cannot find anywhere in Los Angeles that is from KangWangDo province. The herb that they use is from KangWangDo (and “sun-dried”) and not the packages from supermarkets that contain sulfur.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Grilled fish, bulgogi, gondola soup and miso jjigae were very impressive. Unfortunately, lunch seems to lack a lot of side dishes. On the other hand, the lunch price is very good. I thought the gondre salmon roe was a signature menu here and I thought it was a signature menu here, but the soup stew is very popular! Anyway, it is a restaurant that is regarded as a Korean style restaurant which is colorful but does not have to be colorful.

음식 전반적으로 정갈하고 가정식 스타일로 맛있음. 생선구이, 불고기, 곤드레나물밥과 된장찌개가 매우 인상적이었는데 오랜만에 방문해서 먹어본 부대찌개도 괜찮음. 아쉬운 점은 런치는 반찬의 갯수가 조금 부족한듯요. 한편, 런치가격은 매우 착함. 곤드레 나물밥은 이곳의 특색있는 메뉴로 이곳의 시그니쳐 메뉴라고 생각했었는데 부대찌개가 인기가 많군요! 어쨋든 화려하지는 않아도 구수하면서도 색깔있는 한식집으로 여겨지는 맛집임.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlbZu8oXkPe_l1Lws148TGucIAD9Ro6QZxaR6r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9XJ7HrEhPvfNmwD-aoeSixMsA0HsQA_M9INxb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNerhW5oRp-JLnj1F05TUYpHhG3kda0s4UiTg--=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMTtK_CQR5agqpBfY-OorqnqbvpJcfosUHVBI7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM32vrA1zGyQ_CboMCAYt8A-3rYfx8K_ooSaYJS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) I really like bag stew, it is delicious. I do not think there is a place to sell soup stew, so it is not a good place to go, but I think that even if you have a new soup stew shop, you will not be able to taste it here.

The only thing I feel is that I have to go to dinner or togo in the evening, but I can not eat bean sprouts bibimbap because of the exhaustion of materials.

부대찌개를 정말 좋아하는데, 맛있습니다. 부대찌개 파는 곳이 없어서 맛은 별로지만 어쩔 수 없이 가는 곳이 아니라, 새로 부대찌개 전문점이 생기더라도 웬만하면 여기 맛을 넘을 수 없을것 같다는 생각입니다.

다만 아쉬운건 제경우 아무래도 저녁을 먹으러 가거나 저녁에 togo하게 될 수 밖에 없는데 재료 소진으로 인해 콩나물 비빔밥을 먹을 수 없는 점입니다.< /review>

(Translated by Google) There are more houses with many other dogs. Strictly speaking, stars are bad feedback. I can not say that it is bad or I can not give you a star, so it seems to have given me a new life in Chunhyang. Be rich.

이렇게 별세개가 많은집이 더문데. 엄밀히 말해서 별세개는 나쁜 feedback 입니다. 차마 나쁘다고 말할수도, 별한개를 줄수도 없기에 억지춘향으로 별세개를 준듯함. 부자되세요.</Review>

I'm new to cubing and have always enjoyed twisty puzzles.  SpeedCubeShop helped me get a variety of puzzles perfect for my non-competing budget!  Very thorough of the various types and features of each cube.  Plus, they had a great selection from what I was looking for to top-rated cubes.  Really awesome!< /review>

Speed cube shop is the best place I have ever gotten my cubes from. They have great prices and shipping. My cubes always come about a day early then what said and I love that you can track your order. They have great customer service it’s easy to use and they contact you back within hours. Really great shop👍< /review>

I am an adult and I am also a big kid. I love puzzles of all kinds and I used to get them all off of Amazon. Then one day I realized that you pay twice as much for way less at Amazon. Not to mention all the extra services you can get for customization of the puzzles at Speedcube.com. These guys are fast and provide just about the best customer service of any delivery company. Like sending personal thank yous via email.

Keep up the great work!<//Text>

Their custom services produce some of the best cubes on the planet. Highly recommend getting a custom custom product such as a supernova or cosmic cube.
All in all best cubing store.< /Text>< Time>

<user_id>111015790290837676436<//user_id><Text>Absolutely great, my package arrived before it was supposed to, and it’s the best cube I’ve ever held. My times dropped so fast once I got my cube. I was even using a speed cube before, but it was nothing compared to this. It turned so easy and was very easy to customize, and I have no regrets.< /Text><response>None< /response></record>

<review>Have purchased a cube, timer, mini cube, and mat for my 9 year old son! Will definitely purchase more. The quality of the products is excellent, especially compared to that of other companies. I feel like I can trust the products that I buy from here are going to be of the best quality. The service is excellent, great communication through email, and the prices are very reasonable!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>I bought 2 cubes with setup from SpeedCubeShop, and both were setup perfectly.  I prefer to buy from a specialty shop vs. a mega-retailer.  Prices at SpeedCubeShop were as good or better than Amazon, the selection was much better, and there were more options for customization.  Delivery was fast.</Review>< pictures>

If speed cubing isn't your jam, you can still find dozens of other puzzle options. I will never make the mistake of buying twisty puzzles off Amazon again.</Text>< pics>

This is hands down the best online shop experience I have ever had. I recently purchased Lunar lubricant but I then wanted to exchange it for Martian, so I contacted the SpeedCubeShop team if I could change it and they replied in less than 15 hours, updating my order. Not to mention the easy to use website and wide variety in puzzles, custom puzzle lines like supernova, cosmic and uni cube but also the cosmic lubricant line which is exceptionally amazing. Never had such a good experience. Top tier guys keep it going😁. Team SCS!</Review>

<text>Gone are the days of buying puzzles that I have to put together, mod, lube, and sticker myself! These guys really know what they're doing. I think it's great this this hobby has gotten so popular that there are business like SpeedCubeShop who are willing to put in all this work for us. Is it worth spending $100 on a speed cube? Well, my Cosmic Gan 356 XS is the best cube I've ever laid my hands on. Their PVC coating keeps things grippy, too. I'm interested in seeing how much it protects my stickers. Then, there's the fact that it came from the shop exactly how I like it, with no modifications or sanding needed to be done on my end. Priceless! If you can afford it, their Cosmic cubes are worth every penny! I'll definitely be spending more money here as I replace the aging minxes and big cubes in my collection.</text>< pictures>

I have no complaints! The shipping was very quick and they packaged the cubes very well. There was no damage and the cubes were also adorable. SpeedCubeShop has cubes that are budget but good up to expensive brands like Gan. If I ever need any more cubes I'll use this website for sure.</Review>

amazing selection! I’m from Canada so the Canadian cube websites didn’t have nearly as much selection as this one, expected a longer shipping time but arrived in 3 days! Will definitely be shopping here again, I had the free 1-3 day shipping because my order was over 123$ CAN. So I guess tht helped with the shipping. Nothing was broken or missing from my order and i even got sent a free 2x2! Best cube shop I’ve ever ordered from :)< /review>

<Text>I have bought several cubes from these guys, and their service has always been excellent. Will not hesitate to buy from them again. One suggestion for prospective customers: If professional set-up of your cube is offered, get it! It's money well spent to get a cube that is expertly lubricated and tuned.< /Text>< rate>

<Review>I recently purchased quite a few puzzles from speed cube shop for the first time. Within 4 days I had received my international order with absolutely no issues. Where in the past I have had orders take 3 weeks for products to come in with defects. The products were wonderful, I received a follow up email from the owner and a text from customer service asking how I was enjoying my products. If you are into cubing either as a hobby or more seriously I highly recommend going throguh speed cube shop, you will not be disappointed.<//Review>< Pictures>

One of my sons became a cuber a few years ago.  Since then every Christmas, Birthday and any other occasion has become a reason to buy more cubes.  He loves the products and the variety.  I love how easy it is to shop there, how fast the shipping is and how responsive the customer service is.  Everyone is always amazing!  Love the SpeedCubeShop!<//text>

I need to share ho happy we are with their customer service. We had made three purchases from them. Our third order had a little bit of issue, but when I contacted the customer service, they immediately took an action and fixed it for us. We are impressed and thankful for their professional customer service. We will continue to shop there with confidence.< /Text>

I found speed cube dot com and that a great spot to find the right cube for the right price. They are very accommodating and easy to navigate. I ordered 10 cubes from them recently. For the price that is very favorable. These cubes will help train new cubers to enjoy the many facets of cubing as I do. Good company. Thank you speedcube.com.< /text>

Great products at a good price, we were very happy with the purchase!  I removed a star because the packaging on a cube that we bought as a gift arrived torn and in bad shape, not sure if we will be able to gift it.  Otherwise,  happy and will buy from again!< /Review>

<Review>I have ordered from speed cube shop multiple times and they have always done a good job shipping my stuff. The cubes are greatly priced and there are always new deals and sales. I love that they added a new shipping price. My cubes always come at least a day early. They are a great company over all</Review>< pictures>

Due to storms I still haven’t received my cube and I know this isn’t the speed cube shops fault.  They were quick to email me updates and asked me what they could do to help.  They let me know the steps to take should I not receive my cube.  I love their excellent customer service and their quick response time to my emails.  Overall this company is very professional.  I will definitely be buying all my cubes from the speed cube shop from now on! I highly recommend this company!< /Text>

<Text>My daughter had been looking for a 4x4 speed cube and purchased one from SpeedCubeShop with her birthday money.  The cube is exactly what she wanted (made to order just for her).  An email was received several days after the cube arrived to see if everything was okay and to say thanks for purchasing with them.  I'm sure we will be buying more from SpeedCubeShop in the future.<//Text>< Rate>

<text>Customer service is outstanding, I had two broken items from shipping and I issued a return, I sent in photos and information about the defective items. Within the hour I got my money back and I did not have to return the defective items. Every time I make a purchase from speed cube shop I get a personalized email from the CEO, it really seems like they care about customers.< /text>< pics>

<text>This is the best online cube retailer I’ve ever bought from. The cubes I bought from SCS function amazingly. Their lubricant is simply amazing. And not to mention the fact that they process orders much faster then any online shopping store I’ve ever seen, not just rival cube stores. I’m definitely looking to buy from them again soon. Would recommend to all cubers, beginner or pro, casual or competitive.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x80ea403682178671:0x76adb8485c06cfac<//gmapID><rating>5</rating>< username>

They had great communication, amazing product selection, fast shipping (and they were transparent about any potential delays due to pandemic shipping issues or out of stock items) helpful service (I have used their professional lubrication and tension tune-up services for many of the cubes I bought and they were adjusted perfectly).

<Text>I highly recommend Speed Cube Shop.  My son loves their products.  They are durable and well made with many choices to choose from.  With a year like we have been having, this is something that definitely puts a smile on my kid's face and is one more way for him to connect with his friends.  (As I am writing this, he is cubing and chatting up a storm with his buddies online.)
Also, the customer service is phenomenal.  Alex was super helpful and knowledgeable when we had an issue with one of our cubes.  He gave us great information and knows the products.  I really cannot praise this shop enough.  Thank you again for all your help.  :)</Text>< pics>

Great shop with good selection of cubes, as well as other puzzles.  My second order from the shop included a lubrication set up of a new cube.  Everything I have ordered came in great shape.  Very responsive customer service.  I'll definitely be ordering from them again when I need another puzzle.<//Review>

Great product and great service! My son loves his 2x2 cube, and is racing his best times every day. Arrived in Canada quickly with no additional charges. We're very happy and when he's ready for his 3x3, we'll buy from here!<//review>

I bought five 1cm or .50" 3x3 cubes to share with my cubing friends, and they were amazed by how well made these tiny cubes are.
There is a challenge to scramble and solve these cubes, but this is part of the fun.
I highly recommend SpeedCubeShop for their prompt delivery service, great prices, and wide selection.</text>

<text>I love the SpeedCubeShop! Placed my first 2 orders last week and they both were filled and shipped the same day. All items came in good condition. Nothing was missing or damaged. They have prices that rival Amazon and as a bonus, you know you are getting exactly what you ordered in new condition. I've had iffy items from Amazon that might or might not have been counterfeit. You'll always get the real thing at SpeedCubeShop. I haven't ordered a custom lubed cube from them yet, but I've heard good things. Will definitely be going back!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

My son is over the moon about his MoYu RS4M cube! He asked to have it professionally  setup, and he couldn't be happier with the speed he has already gained. According to him, the cube turns faster, smoother and he doesn't need to worry about pops. Thank you Speed Cube Shop for making him super happy!<//Text>

<Review>Ordered on 2/22. Added a second cube to qualify for 2-day shipping. Package has not arrived as of 3/2. I emailed customer service to ask them to contact FedEx, and received no response. I opened a claim with FedEx myself, and again contacted customer service with no response. I have, however, received multiple advertisement emails from them. I do not recommend.

EDIT: In response to the owner's response: You do NOT, in fact, respond to all emails within 24 hours - which is why I had to take it upon myself to open a claim with FedEx.</Review><UserId.>111631017418952678625</UserId.>< Response>

Been steadily growing my cube collection ever since I found this shop. Awesome customer service. I got a puzzle that was slightly defective and they took care of it super quickly. Their shipping is just as fast as Prime too, I've gotten cubes less than 48 hours after I've ordered them and I live in Pennsylvania, so they are crossing the entire US. Overall I don't have much to complain about except a couple puzzles being out of stock for quite a while, but they always come back in stock. Great company!!<//text>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>My son loves these cubes.  He now has three of them.  I would give it 5 stars, but the last one he purchased (the 4x4) exploded on him after an hour of manipulation.  He had to put it back together.  We ordered the pro setup so I expected it to last longer before it locked up hard enough to explode.  Other than that, he is extremely happy with his purchase.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1614532612899, 'text': 'I’m very sorry to hear about the 4x4 popping! While the process up is certainly a good prevention against popping it is not full proof as these higher layered cubes are more prone to popping due to the number of small internal pieces moving around at the same time. If you contact our support we would be more than happy to help get you guys pointed in the right direction to getting it reassembled 😀'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x80ea403682178671:0x76adb8485c06cfac< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Our purchase came when they said it was supposed to, it was very well packaged, and I have one happy kiddo.

<Text>SpeedcCubeShop is by far the best cuber's online store the US has to offer, their website is neatly organized perfectly for you to find the product you need, and trust me, they have it. With cheap budget cubes just so you can upgrade from the disgusted Rubik's brand, up to the best cubes used by professionals, and I first heard of them from YouTube content creators, which shows that they love helping us cube enthusiasts as well. If your getting started or want fast shipping, go with SpeedcCubeShop!< /Text><rate>5<//rate><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80ea403682178671:0x76adb8485c06cfac< /gmap_id>< time>

Not only were the items I bought affordable, but they came in three days with normal shipping conditions and they worked fantastically! I would very much recommend this store to any cubers, new or experienced.< /Text>< pics>

I was very impressed with SpeedCubeShop. I ordered an item for Christmas, and the next business day I received confirmation my item had shipped. It arrived in less than a week. I received an email after I placed my order following up with me to not only thank me for my order, but to open the lines of communication, should I need anything else from them. I was extremely impressed with SpeedCubeShop. I won't hesitate to order from them again in the future.< /Text>

I bought a cube from amazon but they sent me a wrong one, so I returned it and replaced, but now It was 4x4. I was upset and refund them. My son found that some cubers said not to buy cubes from amazon but buy one from here so I start to look at this shop. I found many good cubes and others even cheaper !! Now My son is happy with 2x2 3x3 4x4 and 5x5 cubes.<//Text>

He enjoys collecting cubes but he says these are the best in his collection because of how smooth and fast they move. The variety of shapes and colors really grabbed his attention. He bought so many for a good price and they arrived all together in nice individual boxes. We will keep purchasing from this amazing shop.< /text>< rate>

<Text>An amazing business ran by an amazing team. Cameron has come such a long way and has worked so hard got the success of ScS and it really shows. Although I will no longer be ordering my puzzles from here as I simply can't afford the shipping prices to the UK, I've had nothing but good experiences with the team and any queries I've had have been answered promptly.
Their custom services are unparalleled and they are without any doubt the best place in the world for high quality puzzles and services.

I have been purchasing from SCS for years and have never been disappointed. I use them to buy all of my cubes to introduce family, friends, and school groups to the world of cubing. Fast delivery and always a great selection. I have only had one return/exchange, which was no fault of SCS, and it was a no-stress exchange process. Give them a try and you will not regret it.<//text>

Best cube store yet, fast delivery, great customer service, and great items.
A few days ago I received a cube from SCS and a corner piece was broken on the stem. In under and hour after I contacted them they said they will replace the corner piece for free! Great store, 10/10.< /text>

<Review>Best place to get cubes and lube as well as anything else you might need as far as I'm concerned. Shipping is quick as well (metro detroit area for reference) seems to be normally 3-5 days for usps first class as the cheapest option. No complaints.<//Review>< GmapID>

I ordered these cubes for my cube-enthusiast son. The website was great and easy to use. The communication throughout the whole process, from ordering to shipping to following up, was greatly appreciated. BUT the best part is the amazing products! My son has a large collection of cubes (by other manufacturers) and they just pale in comparison to what the SpeedCubeShop carries. A definite homerun for my son's birthday.< /text>

<text>The SpeedCubeShop is in the same state I am in, which means that I get my cubes faster. I often see things that I want on this site due to the pricing of the puzzle that I want. Sometimes I go to another site to buy a certain puzzle because this site doesn't have it. Other than that I am happy with this site.< /text>< Pics>

My son just recently got into speed cubes and asked for one he found online. Shipping was on time, came intact and so far has survived the 24/7 use of a 12 year old!<//text>

<text>They have cubes at all different prices, so you can find one in your budget. The one I picked out for my son was a great price, and a perfect cube for a beginner. Also, I received a personal email from the CEO letting me know he would address any concerns that we may have with the cube. So far, the cube is great. My son and I are very happy.< /text>< Time>

Very good for new cubers as the cubes go at lower prices than other websites, have 2 budget cubes and they came without damage and were very affordable.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Fabulous selection!  Wonderful products!  Excellent prices!  I purchased many quality Christmas gifts for my daughter, her partner & her friends.  They’re all gamers, and I wanted to find something a little bit different.  I was a teen in the 80’s when these were all the rage.  Had no idea they’d become popular again in recent years.  Was thrilled to see them when they arrived.  My order was shipped quickly & packaged with care.  I’ll be returning for additional products in the future!  Many thanks!< /Review>< pictures>

Seamless purchase, fabulous service, excellent product. Bought the Gan 11M Pro for my son for Christmas. All I knew was he wanted a new cube. I didn’t know I was buying the top of the line best cube out there, but I watched the video and it looked amazing.  He was sooo happy! Best experience ever!< /text>

I purchased for my grandson who is seven and has recently developed a love for solving cubes. He wanted 2 x 2 because he thought it would be an easier way/great way to practice.  He is still having issues and gets  frustrated but the frustration is much less.  He loves the animal cubes.<//Review>

Literally the BEST place to get your cubes and supplies, my son has several cubes, magnets, little tools and lubes, personal cube bags and so much more. We continue to shop and support SpeedCubeShop because not only are their prices very reasonable, the shipping is always faster than expected! Thank you Speed Cube Shop!<//review>

AMAZING QUALITY!!!
The product was outstanding. (Got a 2x2 btw) However the delivery came one day later than expected which isn't that big of a deal considering were in a pandemic. 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!<//Review>

<review>My niece loves the speed cube solving, and when I had to drop-ship her gift this year she got to open it early and absolutely LOVED everything! The 1x1 cube was an especial hit with the whole family. Great shop, great stuff, and honestly great prices for how happy it makes her!<//review><Time>1607202603450</Time>< gmap_id>

<review>This was an amazing experience! About a day after I ordered my cube (Qiyi MS Magnetic 3x3) we got an email from SpeedCubeShop giving my order confirmation and letting me know that if I had any questions I should feel free to ask. I especially enjoyed the fact that it was a personal email as well. When my cube arrived, it came in nice packaging and the cube was great!<//review>< pictures>

I paid for two day shipping and the item would have been here before the epic ice storm if they had shipped it when I ordered it. I'll buy other brands on Amazon going forward. I still haven't received the item but I'm sure it will get here within a week or so after the ice melts.<//review>

I have to say, you guys are seriously AMAZING! I just ordered my son a few things for Christmas during the Black Friday sale, and I chose the mystery item for free at check out. When it came, it literally blew my mind!!! We got the GAN  356 XS!!! What?!?!? Still mind blown....I did not expect something so awesome. My sister also chose the mystery item and received another cool cube. Just wanted to say how excited we are and how awesome YOU are!
Thanks again!!< /Text>

I’ve gotten several different orders from them, and they’ve all showed up in the estimated time and with no issues. I even got the last couple cubes with the professional service setup, and I really liked it. The cubes came broken in and felt really smooth to use. They also have nice deals that rotate out through the shop, I’ve gotten quite a few “steals” through that as well lol< /Review><date>1608938698198< /date></record>

My first experience shopping with SpeedCubeShop was shockingly seamless and we received our order in less than 24 hours from the time we ordered. Second time around the order was lost in transit, but customer service (Alex) was extremely prompt and just fixed it. Very impressed. Products are also great. My son has taken up speed cubing and while I don’t know a lot about it, he rarely puts them down.< /review>

Love this place, even if it's further then thecubicle, I enjoy it more for a few reasons, 1: The lube they provide is better, mostly cause they have many with different purposes and its easy to tell what us for what. 2: Most of the cubers I watch are sponsored by speed cube shop. 3: Their pro service sounds cooler "Supernova" and "Cosmic" sound awesome

The one down side is that they don't sell as many different puzzles, like you won't find the Wuque or Hays 7 M on their website.<//review>

Happy overall.
No troubles with the shipping, everything arrived in good order.
Really happy with the GAN 251M.

But I'm not terribly happy with the "Rubik's Connected replacement stickers", for 3 main reasons.
This is not intended to be a rant, just want to capture the points as clearly as I can :)
1 - I don't like the clear applicator tape - it's frosted, which made it very reflective, and difficult to see the placement. Also I seemed to have the opposite problem from what was mentioned in the helpful sticker-application video: my stickers would not leave the backing and adhere to the clear tape - even rolling it back didn't work; I had to almost ply each sticker off the backing and make sure it didn't shift on the clear tape.
2 - I find the sticker placement extremely biased towards the center, where there is around 1/2mm to all the touching-edges, and more like 2-3mm to the outside edges. Made placement extremely challenging and could afford a little more spread in the placement.
3 - I went with the "Bright" color scheme to try to match my GAN 11 M pro and GAN 251M - and comparing the stickers to those stickerless, it's pretty close....except for the GREEN - the "lime tree green" is much more dull and sickly looking compared to what I saw in the Sticker Picker and on my GANs (which I believe are the "bright" scheme?). (eg. Blue is really close, as are red/yellow/orange - green is different, and difficult to capture in the attached photos.< /Text>

<review>So there are two parts to this review. The first thing is the actual cube. There were no damages, I got what I paid for, and the price was good. The next thing is the shipping time. I was expecting the package ~6 days earlier but it was delayed. I completely expect some delay from covid but it still felt long. Then after a bit I got this pretty nice email from speedcubeshop “A large number of packages have been experiencing delays due to inclement weather conditions. These delays are impacting all mail carriers but we remain in close contact with each carrier and are told that the situation appears to be gradually improving.
Providing you with the best experience is our priority and we hope that these weather delays do not reflect negatively on our service. We are doing everything we can to stay updated and are always just an email or phone call away should you have any questions or concerns.” It was nice if them to reach out and let me know why there were delays instead of keeping me in the dark. The shipping times are the only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because of the shipping times I mentioned. While I am totally cool with spend more get more but it seemed like it was still just too late to just be from covid and weather when there was already a 5-day window to get it delivered.

In summary I think you should buy a cube because they deliver on what they promise even if it is a bit late but from other reviews, they seem to have good shipping times. I love what I got and will most likely be using it for the rest of the time I spend cubing.</review>< Pictures>

I very much enjoy the Galaxy and Peppermint cube lube I received from the Speed Cube Shop!  The items were just as they advertised with no downsizing, and the shipping was on point and even arrived earlier than expected!  I would highly recommend Speed Cube Shop to all my friends who are interested!</Text>

SCS was very nice and communicated extremely well. They're  responsive even if it does take a couple days, and they amswered any questions i had. 100 outta 10 will buy from again.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I ordered three different kinds of cubes. The RS3M 2020, RS4M, and the YJ MGC 5x5. All of these cubes are exceptionally good for the price and I’d recommend them. I got exactly what I ordered and the staff set up my cubes to perfection. Great service.</text>

This is the one and only place I will order my cubes and cube accessories from now on... I ordered a single 2x2 cube and it got shipped in less then the time expected. Then, I ordered a WeiWei M 3x3 which I later realized I miss-typed my address. So I contacted them and they have literally the best and friendliest staff I've ever come across. The people that rate this place bad just don't understand that the shipping delays isn't scs's fault, because the shipments are by USPS and FedEx. I rate this 5 starts, and the condition of the products when they arrive is definitely better then anywhere else.<//review>

I was super satisfied with my first 3x3 order. It was a reasonable price and shipped quickly, even amidst post-christmas and The covid pandemic. So when I got the first email from the CEO about how he was glad that I ordered from them. You would be forgiven for thinking that he just had a program sending these emails out automatically. It wasn't until my second order when I realized that the guy hand writes (figuratively) every email! I have high hopes for my second order. And would give 11/10 every single day if I could! Be safe sir Cameron Brown. Have a good year and may others find you here!<//Text>

I ordered the MoYu RS3 M 2020 and was not disappointed at all. The packaging was great, and was in good condition. The cube is very nice and set up well!</review>

Good communication and fast shipping, though the USPS continues to miss deadlines and be a general embarrassment - on par with governmental services everywhere. SpeedCubeShop was great, though!<//review>

< Review>
Have ordered several times now for my 10 year old who is quite a fanatic of speed cubing.  Shipments have been remarkably quick.  On occasion, I have paid for the pre-shipment inspection and lubing.  He and I agree that this has been a good investment.  I really didn’t have any particular reason for choosing this site over competitor sites, but I am glad that I chose SpeedCubeShop.  I’ll be a customer as long as my son stays interested in speed cubing!  Thank you for several great experiences!</Review>

My son found this rubics cube and wanted to try it out. He looked in to the reviews and noticed they were all pretty decent reviews so I bought him won. He was super anxious to get it and couldn’t wait. He seems to really be loving this one. I must say this is a better one compared to the original Rubics Cube. I am sorry to say that but the turns on this one is really good. It doesn’t get stuck like the others and I have bought him plenty over the years. So this is a great product and I’m sure we’ll be looking into another purchase in the future. Thanks 😊< /Text>

<Review>I ordered a YJ YuLong v2 Magnetic from this site roughly 2 weeks ago, and it came in the mail on time. It wasn't damaged, and the cube seems to work well for both my budget, and for my goals. I would highly recommend this site, personally, if you're into speedcubing. Or solving Rubik's Cubes in general.

Oh, also, the site's CEO e-mails you whenever you make a purchase. I don't know if that sways your opinion or not, but I feel like that's cool to mention.<//Review></record>
</dataset><record>
<pictures>None</pictures><Text>The service is amazing with the massive selection of hundreds of cubes, and amazing quality, ranging from a 19x19 to a 2x2, and other shifting and cool cubes. The price for these cubes is cheaper than amazon (Use discount code JPERM), which is really great. It even comes with a setup service, if you want your cube to be great out of the box, and they sell many different kinds of lube. Their shipping takes only a week, or 6 days, which is not that bad, and the owner is very nice. This is definitely the #1 Speed cubing Seller in the world.<//Text>< resp>

<Text>I love this website!

Before I would order from other company’s but noticed they took awhile to get shipped but once I found out about speedcubeshop, I started picking some items out for me and my brother and when I got to the shipping I was amazed there were faster times that were also cheaper then other company’s! So I think if you need cubes for a normal price I recommend shopping here! (Can’t wait for my new puzzles to come in!)< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Only getting one star because something actually came in the box. They delivered the wrong item. I’ve reached out to correct the error and gotten cheesy canned responses from auto bots, rather than sales reps. I’m really hoping that they read this review and correct it. My 11 year old son spent his own hard earned money on this item and was SO excited for it- now he’s upset and heartbroken. I’m a single parent who lost work due to C19 and can’t reasonably afford to just buy him a new one. I can’t begin to tell you how frustrating it is to not have a phone number to call, or a real person to connect with right now. Really hoping they read this review and reach out to me ASAP. :-(< /Review>< name>

I have ordered from this site several times and have always been very pleased with my orders. They arrive earlier than expected and for the price the cubes are always as good if not better than expected. I recently placed a Black Friday order with a mystery item and not only did I get 10 really awesome cubes for less than 60$, they sent me a GAN nova complete set with magnets... this cube is valued at 25-35$ depending on where you order from. On top of that, I ordered a stickerless 2x2 time machine cube and was surprised when I opened up the box and got a time machine cube with Roman numerals in the style of a compass which saved me from ordering the stickers separately. To me, this was an awesome substitute whether on purpose or not I am very happy with this site overall and will definitely be expanding my cube collection through them again in the future!</review>

Great customer service!! My son ordered 2 cubes for Christmas and I was pleasantly surprised to get a friendly email from them just to thank us for the business. They have exceptional communication and sales skills that a great deal of other businesses could learn from. As well, the order was delivered fairly quickly.< /Review>

<Review>The puzzles are very smooth, I try to buy the top brand names and have the pros at this shop set it up and I beleive that really makes a real difference for me, because I have bought cubes without any pro setups and I just can’t get them setup to suit me! Some people will say you don’t need to spend a lot of money to get a great puzzle and that could be true. I really don’t know, I don’t have much luck with that., Most of the time you get what you pay for. This is my number one place to shop for all my cubes and puzzles.< /Review><gmapID>0x80ea403682178671:0x76adb8485c06cfac<//gmapID>< pics>

I absolutely adore my new Gan 356 XS. I appreciate the option to have it come pre-lubed, and ready to go! Needed very little tweeking out of the box as it's a little loose for me, but my gosh is it smooth, and wonderful to solve!

Fedex had delays, but that's no reason to not give you guys 5 stars for a wonderfully packaged, and shipped product!<//Review>

<Review>My son found this cube himself online and asked if I would buy it for him.  The checkout was easy and fast and our cube arrived within the week.  He loves it and plays with it constantly.  The price was right as well.  Thank you Speed Cube Shop!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>111334828047294100900</user>< rate>

<review>Best cube store ever! I was in and out, and the service was great! I used a discount code, Blue for 10% off and the cashier didn't hear of it, and he believed me! Great customer treatment. By the way, that discount code is valid use code "Blue" and get 10% off!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

There is no other place to buy cubes. Displays cares about their customers so much that they will respond to any question within 24 hours, the cubes are amazing, and they are overall nice people. I will only buy my cube from them.< /text>

<Text>GOOD JOB SCS. I ordered a few cubes from here to test the waters. 2x2 and 3x3 A+ in my book. Super fast shipping on their side out the door anyway. not so much on usps😔. I even, as a test asked them in the special instructions to write happy birthday and I'll be, handwritten on a post it way to go. Will definatly be buying my 4x4 and 5x5 from them soon. Probably some other more novelty gifts for friends as they seem to have anything I could want or need.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Amazing as always.  They let me know the UV coating GAN 11 had defects and let me switch up my order seamlessly. I got a refund for the difference and my cube showed up on time and is great.  Always a pleasure and professional experience with SCS!<//Review>

I've placed two orders with SCS in the last month and I love their customer service!  Their website is clean and easy to find what you are looking for, their response to orders and questions is above and beyond!  Little things like a personal thank-you from the owner every time an order is placed tells me that they take customer satisfaction very seriously. I highly recommend the SCS for any cubing needs!< /Review>

Order placed and filled quickly and accurately as I’ve come to expect as normal. When there is a problem (we’re all human and pencils still come stock with erasers) it’s addressed and solved expeditiously. Wish all online shopping was so pleasant.<//Review>

I ordered a supernova cube and i love it! I've heard that mgc cubes come out of the box very loose and kinda dry, but my cube has had no problems with its tension and i can definitely feel the lube as i turn, its my favorite one in my collection. I love ordering my cubes on scs and i can guarantee ill be doing it again.< /review>

Awesome site, awesome service. I am not a cuber myself, but my son is. Did his first 3x3 at age 5, the 5x5 at age 7 and now a 7x7 at age 9. Got to the finals of his first national sanctioned competition last year against adults, and this site is a big reason why!  Thanks!</review>

This is an amazing place with all sorts of awesome puzzles! They are at good prices and always arrive on time. The only downside is that for small orders you need to pay shipping but it is still very cheap!

Very awesome store that I recommend!</Review>

Really good prices from this place.  You can get your budget cubes on the cheap (better prices than eBay or Amazon).  Great company that cares about its customers.  Don't go anywhere else!< /text>

Our goal is to clearly communicate how many business days it has been since your package has left our warehouse which is why we send you the ship date calendar. As much as we wish that we can prevent shipping delays once the package is with the mail carrier we cannot prevent such delays and the inclement weather in the United States recently has been contributing to a lot of delays. I’m more than happy to do what we can to help and will send out a replacement after a certain period of time but we do ask that you remain patient while the weather conditions are sorted out as there is nothing that we can do to speed that up.'}</Response>

They charge for shipping and items take forever to arrive. When I spoke to customer service, the rep was extremely condescending and sent me a link for timeanddate.com to “explain” what a business day was. Never once did they try to ameliorate the delay in shipping, rather just blamed it on the post office. Never buying anything from them again due to their attitude.< /Text>

Their cube setup service is great too.<//Review>

I think you should not have sent a requedt for a review until after the item has arrived, since it is not here yet after ordering a month ago. There is a saying if you haven't anything good to say best not to say anything.<//Text>

<text>The speed cube shop has every cube I’ve heard about at the best price. Top quality and very fast delivery. I’ve bought speed cubes off Amazon.com but they don’t seem to be as legitimate as SCS as far as the packaging. I would highly recommend for anyone interested in finding the best speed cube for their style.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I love this company. As a speedcuber, I love using a company that actually takes care of their customers. I have ordered about 5 items from SpeedCubeShop and all 5 of them have been delivered in great condition, which I greatly appreciate. I enjoy watching the content made by YouCubers such as J Perm, Cubing Encoded, etc. Because of their content, I love having a reference for the types of cubes and brands to use.

The prices of the products are very well-placed and are inexpensive enough. The sales and markdowns are worth it. Other companies like The Cubicle, only shave off a couple of dollars worth of their products when there's a sale. SpeedCubeShop shaves nearly half the price when it's on sale. I greatly appreciate this. Though the discounts that YouCubers give, are only 5% off and I am a little unimpressed with this.<//Review>

I could literally not ask for a better website. I’ve have literally bought every cube but one from here. The shipping from the other company (who I won’t name) wasn’t quite as fast and it was more expensive. However SpeedCubeShop was very fast cheap delivery and amazing cubes.</text>

By far better than the cubicle. When you get your cubes you can tell how much effort they put into their store. Respect<//Review>

<Review>Still waiting for the items I ordered to arrive, ordered with two day shipping, still waiting 10 days late

Update: STILL waiting for the items I ordered on Feb. 22nd now March 7th. Fedex hasn’t been helpful and neither has the customer service for this company, offering me a 10% coupon for my “next” purchase (not going to happen) is not sufficient. At this point a refund or replacement is what should be done and this company should take it up with Fedex.  I understand completely that Speedcube shop has no control over fedex. Not the point any longer.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1614661710255, 'text': 'We are very sorry to hear that but cannot control the shipping delays that are occurring due to the inclement weather conditions. If you contact our support we are more than happy to send you a replacement package although it might not arrive much faster.

< review>
I enjoyed the comet lube and the yuxin 3x3 a lot! They are really fun to use and the lube is very affective with all my cubes I have at home. One thing to note though is that my delivery time was delayed and had to wait for a week to get two things. The delivery was horrendous, absolutely horrible.</review>

We don’t have any part of the delivery process so we can’t do much to help there but we are seeing that there are some delays during the holiday season and covid which is impacting all carriers.

Go to place for cubes. Want to become a sub 10 cuber. Still practicing. Had just the walmart rubiks for a long time. Started watching videos. Got links to this store and have bought like 20 cubes so far. Great store. Easy customer service.</Text>

The first time I ordered from speedcube.com, my package never came.  First time from any shipper. I hated having to tell them that I didn't receive my order,, figured they'd be like yeah right buddy but they were super chill,  treated me with understanding and respect.. my replacement package came fast with no issues..... this next time the order arrived with no problems... I'm sure the original problem was a problem with the deliverer, as I've gotten other people's packages before,  at least I was honest enough to take it to them... oh well... their product was exactly as I ordered,  and I will purchase from them again for certain....< /Text>

Very happy with the cube I received, arrived promptly. A lot of excess lubricant on the outside of the cube, but that’s very minor. Would 100% purchase from Speed Cube Shop again!< /Review>

Ok, where do I start? The beginning?
My son asked for some things from SCS for Christmas and I threw in a few extra items... he was STOKED {cubing lube? it's a thing...a cube tree ornament? still in his room!} Ok, so I bought him some items, they arrived quickly and as expected... What WASN'T expected was a personal email from the shop owner to thank you for my order {let's just say I shop a lot, and I mean a LOT online, to get a PERSONAL thank you is, well, pretty much unheard of!!}... my son was unusually excited about this- so I asked Cameron if he would kindly email my son... which he promptly did~ resulting in some serious stoke in my 13 year old {as a Mom, it was pretty cute!
Cameron is the bees knees, the shop is AWESOME and has a fantastic variety of items available for you or your loved ones. I don't like to tell people what to do... ok, maybe I do:  SUPPORT SPEED CUBE SHOP.< /review>

Bought my first real speed cube from here and I was not disappointed at all, quite the opposite actually! I opted for the service to have my cube lubed up & all that, and it still shipped super fast and arrived early!
Not to mention, the cube itself is phenomenal! SCS is most definitely gonna be my one stop shop for anything I need going forward in the speedcubing world.</text>

Package was received in good condition. This is a Christmas present for my son. We hope he loves it. He saw it on YouRube and speed
Cube shop sold both items he was interested in. Thanks we know if he wants to ordered more, SpeedCube shop is the place we will go!< /Review>

Fast shipping, good service, and quickly shipped out my order. They have incredibly good prices, I bought two sets of ten of the same two cubes in order to practice making cube mods and didn't pay nearly as much as one would expect from buying 20 very high quality cubes.

Their shipping is so fast I placed my order earlier today and it was scanned as picked up within four hours!!!

If you are looking to buy a range of cubes for rock bottom prices and don't want to wait or take risks with buying them directly from China, SpeedCubeShop is the best distributor of cubes and cubing supplies without a doubt in my mind.< /review>

I had not attached the right email and I was concerned my package would arrive without my knowledge, I called the company and asked if they were able to change this, they not only changed that but let me know it would not be able to arrive on time due to an item that was on back order for a few more months. This is a GREAT company!< /review>

<Text>Great puzzle store, especially loved their selection of stickers and lubricants as nowadays stickered puzzles are becoming less prevalent - even before affiliation with SCS. They offer a variety of lubricants, all of which have their own purpose and can change the speed and feel of a puzzle.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Absolutely recommend. I made a mistake in my order, and because I didn't say that my order required a spare piece, my order shipped without the piece, which was entirely my fault. But after a week or so had gone by, scs sent an email and said they would make it up to me, so they sent me the piece. They didn't need to do that since it was my mistake, but I am soooooooo thankful that they did. These people are great.</Text>< Pictures>

It would be cool if your website and app were linked so that you don’t need to edit both carts. It would also be helpful if you had browsing section in the app just like on the site.</Text>

<review>The customer service is soooo good here. They are not like eBay or Amazon. They won't ignore you and they treat you better than anywhere else does. If you buy your cubes at Amazon or Ebay... stop and start buying from here. You will never get mistreated, argue with customer service, or get completely ignored. I tried other websites but none of them beat this website.</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<time>1607105197400<//time><rate>5<//rate><Text>I learned about SpeedCubeShop through J Perm. I wanted to know what a cube with magnets felt like, and the first cube I bought on this website was the MoYu RS3M 2020. Since then I have been a returning customer who is satisfied with the products and services here. My only criticism for SpeedCubeShop is that you have to pay a certain amount of money to waive shipping & handling fees, and sometimes popular items are out of stock. They sometimes throw in promotional free items for certain events, or for having a high valued order. They also have all the usual social medias to keep up to date with promotions and new releases, and I think their owner, Cameron, is pretty knowledgeable on just about everything on here. I recommend everyone who is interested in speedcubing to use SpeedCubeShop.< /Text>< Pictures>

I emailed about an order I had placed that included a cube that was on pre order, asking if they could just ship the rest of my order separately, and I received an email back within a day telling me that they shipped my order, including the pre order product. Would highly recommend.

I also purchased a cube and something happened and it kind of broke. This was in no way SpeedCubeShop’s fault; but they let me send it back and fixed it at no charge aside from shopping. Very satisfied< /review><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<Text>I started using speedcubeshop years ago when I started cubing because they’re prices were very similar to other retailers and the shipping was a lot quicker. However I had never used the professional setup service. This past order for Xmas I got the supernova lubrication and tensioning service for a minimal up charge and I can say that it was definitely worth it. The MGC 6x6 supernova is the best cube that I have ever received out of the box. My times dropped drastically as well setting a new pb by 40 seconds within my first mean. (4:20-3:40)<//Text>< time>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I really enjoy ordering from SCS they have great customer service and the cube lubes i bought are awesome. The monster go cube is such a nice cube too, smooth turning and feel, if you can't afford a Gan  "labeled" cube then get this one, it is a very affordable Gan.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

My pre-teen son is into Speed Cubing and he first ordered from both The Cubicle and Speed Cube Shop. He instantly became a Speed Cube Shop only buyer after some great experiences (and no great ones with Ghe Cubicle). They communicate so quickly and thoroughly, are helpful, and the orders always arrive fast. Thank you!</Text>

Used to be an avid cuber back in the day. Watched some YouTube videos of newer cubing stuff, and have gotten back into it, I've ordered all my new cubes/cubing supplies from SCS, and added the setup on all my cubes, and I gotta say, I am 100% impressed and could not be happier with what I've received!< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Worst guys to deal with, had ordered a GAN cube to be shipped to india as a gift for my nephew on 26th Oct 2020. The shipment showed it's reached mumbai chatrapati terminus within a week and been there since. After a couple of weeks I followed up via email, however was asked to wait as the delivery time was 31 business days. The waiting game started, then after 31 business days was told that they cannot open a case with their courier partner before 45 business days. Clearly the parcel is lost in transit and the product not received I ordered another one from Amazon and was delivered within a week. Now I am following up for my refund but they are declining saying you did not opt for insured courier. They haven't mentioned on their website that they will not deliver with standard shipping, and if you just want to get our hard earned money why not just ask for a donation? Big shifty people I would suggest stay away from them as they have their local courier partners to blame for everything.<//review>< Pics>

<resp>{'time': 1609907225035, 'text': 'Hi, first of all I am sorry to hear that the package wasn’t delivered but I will tell you the same thing that we told you during our email correspondences. Once a package leaves our warehouse we have nothing to do with the delivery process and cannot prevent delayed deliveries especially during the busiest time of the year. Today was the 45th business day that your order was in transit and we are now able to open a claim with the USPS and your local post office since they are in possession of the package. Despite you not opting for insured delivery we still offered you a free replacement which you rejected because you say that you purchased elsewhere. We will continue to update you with the results of the claim as they are given to us but we do not have delivery partners just to be clear 👍'}< /resp>< GmapID>

I am most impressed with SpeedCubeShop’s delivery rate, I recently bought a pvc coated cube and they got it sent after a few days during the holiday season. SpeedCubeShop has yet to fail me in anything and their website is nice and easy to use, just make sure you use code “jperm”.</text>

It shipped out the next day and I received email updates when my order shipped, was out for delivery, and was delivered.  The cube was well packaged in a nice bubble envelope.  I also received a personalized email from the owner, a nice touch. This place is top notch, will definitely be my first stop for all future cubes.</text>< Pics>

<text>I have a huge amount of respect for Cameron and his team at SCS. Running my own ecomm business I know how much work it takes to make the clean site, lead a friendly and helpful team, and manage a lot of inventory of very similar products, and they do it well. I’ve learned a lot from the cubers they sponsor, and I’ve ordered many, many times over the last 2 years and always been beyond satisfied.< /text>< pics>

<Text>Got my Yuxin Little Magic 3x3 M in just two business days with professional setup and, it is unbelievably great! I thought my Mofang MF3RS was good before but, now I can't stand using it because the Little Magic is just so good. My solves have never been so fast, especially after I learned how to properly control such a fast cube. Would highly recommend SpeedCubeShop, The Yuxin Little Magic M, and, of course, the professional setup with a nice fast core lube and a medium-slow piece lube! Overall, very impressed!< /Text><Name>Corey Smith</Name>< response>

I love speed cube shop there website is so easy to use and they make sure to tell you about all the new puzzles if you sign up with your email. When you order something they tell when it was delivered and when it arrived. The cubes are no where close to being overpriced so If you want to get quality puzzles then I recommend speed cube shop. Btw use code jperm at checkout for 10% off your whole order(i think its 10%)< /Review>

<Review>Spent 80+ dollars on a rubix cube, which took forever to get here, and I do understand it was custom made, but that does not excuse it being here 2 weeks later. And I could get over that, but when I opened my box I was even more disappointed than before. I open my box open and see that my rubix cube magically has black edging. I specially remember putting stickerless bright, as I do with every single rubix cube I have ever bought. Also my Exoshield that I paid 25 extra dollars for was not worth it because it came with air bubbles all over the cube and it looks terrible. It’s the quality I expect from a 5 dollar cube not an 80+ dollar cube. I will more than likely be trying to get my money back for this garbage and taking my business elsewhere.</Review>< userid>

Bad customer service, my package never arrived, looks like the usps guy misplaced It in other mailbox, speedcube just answer with a link to do a claim with the carrier...this is very inconvenient and the carrier wont let me open a claim...not sure why, speedcube should be  who opens the claims and should give me a refund right away when I reported that package never arrived...that' a good customer service...not just sending a link..</text>

Placed a couple of orders for my son who has not been into cubing very long. He's now a very happy lad, both orders arrived surprisingly quickly and the Gan 11M Pro is his favourite thing ever.</Review>

<Review>I love this place! My dad got me a Gan 3x3x3 and a 2x2x2 for my Birthday and I love playing with them! I just started getting into cubing and I saw that the YouTuber JPERM was talking about how good they were so I decided to get some birthday cubes. The owner sent my dad a really nice E-Mail, thanking us for shopping there. The shipping took a bit longer than expected but because of the cubes great condition and the custom $4.99 pro settings, it doesn't matter. I will continue to shop from here, and I would definitely recommend anyone who reads this to do the same. Thank You!</Review></record></dataset><record>

My GAN 356i2 and Robot 2.0 arrived in perfect condition, they work perfectly fine and im verry happy with the product. One small thing tho.

On your "lube your cube" Card.. Who is supposed to read that? I mean the "Speed, Control, Gummy and Heavy". The print is really really small and even with my glasses I really struggled to read that and it kinda hurt my eyes a little. Might be only me bc my bad sight but I think you could print that a bit bigger. There is enough place on the card anyways and I think I pay enough money so that you can afford a bigger font on the card. No offense. Just an idea. Actually, let me quickly ask my room-mate.

Yeah... she couldnt read that either. Bigger font it is😉. Other than that im again verry happy. Looking forward to order from you guys again in the future, maybe even with a better readable card. Lets wait and see^^

Kind regards, have a great week and dont let corona get you down.

SpeedCubeShop is the place to get your puzzles and accessories. So far, my YJ MGC Elite 3x3 that I bought from here and Martian from the Cosmic Lub collection have allowed me to decrease my times by so much. In March, I averaged 30. Now, I have a PB single of 9.89 seconds and a PB average of 5 of 12.13. Overall, I would highly recommend.</review>

Had a mixup with an order. Called in and left a voicemail. Got a quick call back with a response. They definitely went out of their way to make things right and I greatly appreciate that. The cubes are amazing and flow so smoothly. We will definitely continue to business with them.<//text>

<review>I took advantage of the deals on Black Friday by getting a decent puzzle instead of going budget and well it added up so I decided to leave out a 4x4 and planned on ordering it on a later day so I could spend that money on having all my puzzles with the pro service and since they were offering three options based on our checkout total I took the gamble and chose the mystery gift and well to my surprise I received a 4x4. I am so happy with the quality of all my puzzles from my wrm2020, to my pyraminx and magaminx and my 4x4 and it all came in a very timely manner. Love their products and service.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea403682178671:0x76adb8485c06cfac</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love it I haven't even bought anything from it on thing is that i don't wan any on to buy from here speed-cube shop .co.uk   go to this em ail and help the real speed cube shop by going to this email abuse@cloudflare.com and copy and paste this message:

“The website that you are hosting, speedcubeshop.co.uk, is operating unlawfully by

This is the best place to buy all of your SpeedCubes and I love their products . The Owner is a nice guy and their service is amazing. Except for the PVC coating, I recently bought a gan xs with PVC coating, But I don’t feel any grip enhancements and only really feel the overlaysI have a standard gan xs and I feel that the grip is better on the standard gan instead of the coated cube. I personally would not recommend the PVC coating. Other than that it is a great store 😀<//text>

I like their service with cosmic and supernov, also their cube quality and they have almost all collection of cube, but I am disappointed with their customer service because they don't reply very soon and also most of the times I don't get answer to what I ask and their shipping is also a bit late.<//text>

The site is very easy to operate, and is only hard because of my mobile. A bunch of lovely puzzles on stock, and on my second order the CEO sent me a very positive email. First Class Shipping is oddly cheap, and shipping is very speedy. Costs are very acceptable. Would order again!</Text>

I thought it would be safe to go to scs but no .opposite... there was a deal that said if you order in the next few hours it will be shipped the next day it no it has been too long I wish to have received my order the next day I may come back to shop ONLY IF you guys can make it up to me it’s still in bakersville for gosh sake</Review>

Good service very fast. However my huanglong 5x5 M was chipped on a white piece but I think it’s the factory’s fault and they accidentally sent me 3x3 SCS logo stickers instead of the 5x5 SCS logo stickers I ordered.<//Text>

I’ve worked with SpeedCubeShop for a long time now and despite the fact that I’m sponsored by them, I wouldn’t represent my brand with them if they weren’t the best! Customer Service is out of this world, shipping time is fast and prices are always low.<//Text>

We went from Finland to here to Bakersfield, because of the speedcubeshop. I bought many new cubes (100$ in total). Crew was really nice and i got even some free little things. For example: there was last white SCS cube bag, and there wasn't that plastic thing on the other rope. So he gave that bag for me for free! Overallgreat experience and crew is ready to help for you! If you are going to this shop, its better to find some cubes in internet before going in the shop. Recommending for every cuber!!!<//text>

I ordered the wrong version of a cube online. I called them and they were able to change my order immediately because it hasn't shipped yet. Super friendly, really awesome customer service. I will definitely be buying my puzzles from them in the future!< /Review>

Today was the third time I have ordered from Speed Cube Shop, and they have been amazing. I appreciate how fast the prepare and ship orders. I ordered a backpack at about noon and by about 4pm it was on a fedex truck.  They were wonderful to deal with on an exchange. And I would recommend this business to anyone with no worries they will deliver...<//text>

<Name>ALYJAH WILLIAMS</Name><review>This place is just about anything you could ask for in a great cube shop,the prices are low,they are legit, the cubes are legit,this my first time ordering from the online website and the order got here in 2 days i realize that may seem like a long time but it come all the way from California that is excellent also the prices are so low that i was worried that this cube was garbage,i know that this is the website that everyone uses but i thought this was the fake website everyone has been has been talking about.finally the cube quality,the cube quality is excellently my main before was a rubix brand(which by the way is not THAT bad,i got some sub 50s on that thing)now my main is the qiyi sail w 3x3x3 and right after got a pb of 42 seconds,right now i have a qiyi 2x2x2 coming in.< /review></record>

Awesome little store. Son found the SpeedCube shop here. Owner is great, my son asked 21 questions and he responded to all of them. Will defiantly be coming back now that we know where it's located.<//review>

<Text>I ordered a GTS3 at around august. Paid everything online to only get a shipping invoice from FedEx. It's been 3 months and now I randomly get a duty tax out of nowhere that says I have to pay $12.46. I spent $60 CAD so it I was completely dumbfounded that that duties tax is over 20% of the order. I've ordered from Amazon numerous times and I've only had to pay for the product and shipping. Amazon never charged me duties so why would I suddenly get an invoice from FedEx for a duties tax when I order from you guys. Make it more clear on the payment page that I'll be charged 20% in duties fees. Now I feel I'm going to get charged another set of "handling fees" that brings the total I paid from$60, then to $72, then to $100. Ordering from speedcubeshop has only caused me headaches and a constant worry that I'm going to get charged with a fee that was hidden in a block of legal text. Will not order from you again.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I ordered from this website. It had a lot of different options of cubes. I was very impressed and thought this would be better than the cubicle. This was my second time ordering cubes but my first time ordering from here. This all seemed legit, the shipping was cheaper and there were good options. But DO NOT get the FED Ex 2- day shipping. They say that is only takes two days. Two days! So we ordered it and thought it would come two days after. Guess what? The next day we get an email saying it will be delivered next Tuesday! Do not spend $6. whatever cents there is to get '2 day shipping'. The free shipping is better. They say it would deliver in maximum 5 days. I should've got the free shipping but instead got scammed for 6 day shipping! 6 Day Shipping! Always remind me why cubicle is a better website. At least they're honest. And BTW Cameron, you wont see an order under this account. The name it is under is Jc Casaclang.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

As we outline on our shipping page, FedEx does not process new mail over the weekend making Monday the 1st business day and Tuesday the 3rd the second business day which would be on time.

They stole my money. I ordered them a Cosmic Gts 3m cube with PVC coating. They didnt applicate the pvc coating, and they cant keep the guaranteed shipping time. To this date, they have not responded to any request and have not returned any money.<//review>

Excellent customer service. They email when they send the order and when the order should have been received. They also recognized me as a repeat customer and thanked me for it.<//review>

My son bought Valk 2 M cube on the event at Thousand Oaks. It works awesome. He really likes it.
It is actually a good idea to open a stand or booth at the event, so people can buy cube or accessories without shipping fee.
Thanks.<//Text>

Ordered Dec 12.  Got shipping notification today Dec 23 they shipped today 2 day so it will arrive December 26.  Thanks, kids love Christmas presents on the 26th.  Shows absolutely no care for customer... SMH.  *WOW REPLY SIMPLY BLAMES ME AS THE CUSTOMER VS EVEN AN OUNCE OF REMORSE THAT THEY SHIPPED ON 23rd OF DEC, with no option to OVER NIGHT AND SIMPLY DROPPING AT A PICK UP LOCATION VS A REAL FEDEX LOCATION.  Again shows no care for customer.  I will never shop here again.  Would give negative stars if I could, spent over $100 and get zero care from customer service on actual delivery.<//text>

This place was so cool it's amazing to see all the cubes on all the shelves. I wish there were more around the country, like in Chicago, Orlando, Portland, New York, You know what I am talking about. I wish they were in these places. I just hate having to pay online and having to wait days for them to arrive. But when they do, the rest of the day, I cube. I love speedcubeshop.<//review>

<review>Customer service was great and really nice, but one of my items got backordered and held up my order, it has been 4 weeks since i ordered it and it still has not arrived, I contacted them after the 2nd week to see what was going wrong. They said that my puzzle was backordered and asked me if I wanted to ship out the other puzzle, I said yes. The puzzle was never shipped out until 2 days ago when we got in contact with them. We paid for 2 day delivery at checkout and has taken longer than 2 days to deliver. TLDR they never contacted me about a puzzle that was backordered and stressed me out for 4 weeks and did not select the shipping option that I paid for. Update: We got in touch with them again, they said they would ship it out the next day, they did not, so now I have to wait longer for my package to arrive and this is the 3rd time they said they shipped the puzzle but they actually haven't.</review>< Resp>

It was terrible experience for me when my kid order it from Canada. We did not know why they charged more than 50% tax on customs. Once the delivery company asked us for so much tax, we just asked them to ship it back. I told them I could pay the handle and shipping fee only. I want them to refund some of money for me but they never did......< /Review>

The cubes are quality and you can get emails on the latest cubes. Plus, all of this can be shipped to your front door with a variety of different shipping options.
