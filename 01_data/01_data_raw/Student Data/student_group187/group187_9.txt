Erik is the man! We have bought two boats from him now. He puts the customers needs first and will spend all the time it takes to get your dream boat right the first time. Looking for a new Malibu? I highly recommend you go see him.</review>

We purchased a brand new boat out of the area and when we got it home it had all kinds of mechanical issues. Two shops could not find it or fix it. The team at VS Marine went above and beyond to get it running as it should. I can’t recommend them enough! Great job! Thanks for everything.< /Text>

Fantastic boat buying experience. Shawn and the crew are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. He spent almost an hour with me explaining every system and feature of the boat. I highly recommend VS Marine.< /text>

I highly recommend VS Marine.  My research said try to find a dealer that is there for you.  Boats occasionally have issues.  If you have someone that helps you in a pinch, stick with them.  This is exactly the service you will get from Kris and Shawn.</Text>

This team has become family to us. We love VS!! This is our second boat that we’ve purchased from them and will never buy a boat anywhere else. We also sold our last boat through them and we’re able to relax knowing it was in good hands and it sold within 2 days of being listed. We feel sooo well taken care of every single time we are there. Thank you all for everything!!< /review>

Went there for life vests. Only place in our area that had them regularly stocked during the summer. Coast guard approved ✓ variety for type of use i.e. 🎣, 🛶 and water-ski, for our family. Also liked how Kid's life vests are neon colors. Gives other vessel's xtra additive for all safety reasons.< /Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>We searched and searched and searched for our families boat.  I always kept VS Marine as a top choice although we live 250 miles away.  Timing was perfect and every mile driven up and back was worth it.  The communication was amazing from phone and through text.  From photos of the boat in real time to starting the buying/finance process the day before driving up.  Kris and Tina were amazing and we can't thank enough.  Highly recommend VS Marine for anyone in the boat market and hesitant about finding a good dealer or hesitant on making the drive there.  It was a great experience for my family.</text>< Resp>

<Text>I recently had the opportunity to have Shawn help me with a 2019 Malibu 23 LSV.  I have never experienced such amazing customer service in someone going  above and beyond to help me in any consumer setting. They were not my local dealer but took extra pictures, and answered every question and were unbelievably responsive to any questions I had. Great dealership. I usually don't leave reviews but VS Marine deserves this one! Thanks guys!!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

VS Marine is AWESOME!! We purchased a previously owned Malibu MXZ from VS Marine. We hunted for the right boat deal for a few years, and found VS Marine to be fairly priced. The team at VS Marine bent over backwards to help us make the right decision for our family. The crew at VS came in on their day off (not to mention it was a holiday weekend - huge shout out to Sean) to take us out for a test drive on the boat. The test drive and friendly service helped us to decide to buy our boat from VS. Since I live in the LA area all of my communication with the team was through calls and texts. Thank you to Kris for always being responsive and answering my endless questions.  Kris was always transparent and honest and I had a lot of trust and confidence in his advice. I also relied on Kris to modify my boat tower to fit in my garage and it was customized PERFECTLY. I received a good deal on the boat, and the customer service made the process a great experience. I have over 30 years experience in the boating industry on the consumer side, and I can't speak highly enough about the customer service I received when purchasing our boat from VS Marine. You guys rock!</review>

<review>Kris and his Team at VS Marine are true professionals! I found a used Malibu online and purchased it with huge confidence- after our initial conversation he sent a myriad of supporting pictures and detailed information. I live in Colorado, and found it much easier and more trusting purchasing a boat from VS Marine over 1,000 miles from my home- than the Dealer 20 miles away!</review><username>Peter Koclanes< /username>< Rate>

I need it some parts and the employee that helped me was very nice, however the owner is the type of person that profile the customers, he make customers feel about 1 inch above the floor if he don't see a potential for buying a  $100k boat from him, specially if you are looking for a part only.
Was very disappointed to see that, I've been buying from the shop for years but I guess I never seen the owner acting before, surprise.
Like to thank the service department employee that deserves all the respect, very professional,
Watched the owner how bad he communicate and treat employees.
I bought my new boat elsewhere for that same reason and parts I'm shopping online for better people customer service.
I Don't support these businesses since I don't believe in profiling customers and mistreating employees who are the key for a successful business, I don't think any business owner will succeed without good employees.
Good luck<//Text>

My husband and I purchased a beautiful 2019 Bennington Tri Pontoon on 7/14/19. We are
“Newbies”, had the best customer service. Owners Kris and Tina were gracious & humble, they helped us with our purchase, no pressure!! Kris loaded our Bennington as if it was his own!! Capt. Ron spent time with us at Lake Nacimiento, he was so helpful and made our purchase even more special. So patient, pleasant unforgettable experience!!!
Since then we’ve been to the lake twice, my husband has contacted Kris on his cell with random questions... Kris is AMAZING!!
We’ve shopped around in the Central Valley area and there is N0 COMPARISON!!!

We highly recommend them. Family owned and can honestly say, they treated us like family!!!

THEY HAVE OUR BUSINESS NOW and OUR FUTURE BUSINESS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Thank you Kris and Tina for helping us in our purchase and building more family memories!

Respectfully,

Raul & Sam

I am so impressed with the VS Marine staff!  I have been in Southern CA boating for years and our adventures have brought us up here.  I am so impressed with the VS Marine team.  The service department was excellent and we now bought a boat from the team.  The experience was awesome and we are enjoying working with this crew. The difference is CUSTOMER SERVICE, and they know how to treat a customer!  I cant say enough about Shawm when its comes to customer service.  What a great, team, and I am proud to be a new Malibu owner from VS.  Thank you all!! I have the highest recommendations for them.<//Text>

Kris, Tina, Shawn & Mike are an awesome team. We love our new boat and the experience we have had dealing with every one at VS Marine. They are not only knowledgeable, but they actually care, which is so refreshing! If you want to buy a new boat or get your boat serviced, you owe it to yourself to at least check them out.<//review>

Their customer service and help throughout the entire process of analyzing the boat, making the decision to purchase, preparing the boat for shipment and delivery was simply spectacular.  The boat arrived sooner and in excellent condition to our home, having been delivered across multiple states.  Highly recommend this outstanding dealership.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>VS charged us over $3000 for repairs to a 40 HP Honda motor. The motor never worked properly and was soon taken out of service. VS refused to make good on the work or to refund all or part of the charges. Too bad when these dealers have somewhat of a captive audience and feel that they can do whatever they want.<//Review>< Pictures>

Kris at VS marine really help me buy a boat from them. With me being over two hundred miles we did a lot by phone and internet. Kris even came to my house and towed my trade-in back to his dealer ship to put on consignment until my boat was built. I lost one of my rear seats(high wind} and shawn Wilson helped me get a replacement. VS marine is the place to buy a boat.<//text>

<date>1444500011271</date><rating>5<//rating><review>I would like to start off by thanking Kris and Tina and everyone at VS again for everything and helping our family get the boat we will be able to enjoy for years to come making memories that will stay with us.
As a long distance buyer of a boat you have to have a lot of faith in who you are dealing with and they blew away every expectation I had.  I had previously bought another boat long distance and it really wasn't a good experience at all. As soon as the payment was made the service and promises went out the window, but from my first conversation with Kris I could tell this would be different.
The service I received through the entire process was 5 star.
The only thing I would change is I only wish I lived closer so I could have bought our boat in person.
Kris and Tina were always available to answer any question we had no matter how silly it might have been, and if they didn't know the answers they got back to us asap with them.
They really do care about you and what you are looking for, not what they think you need and these days I think that's rare.  So if you are looking for a boat give them a chance you won't look any further.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>I recently bought my first boat ever from Kris at VS Marine. While I have some minimal boating experience, I was apprehensive about purchasing a 12 person deck boat given that I had never towed anything, let alone towed/launched a 4,000 lb boat. Kris spent an entire Sunday with me practicing taking the boat on/off the lake, hitching the trailer to my truck, towing the boat around town and everything in between. He spent many hours walking me through every aspect of owning and operating a boat and all that comes with it. By the end of the process I was confident/comfortable enough to take the plunge and buy my very first (dream) boat. I cannot say enough good things about Kris and his wife Tina and how they treated me throughout the entire process and really made me feel like part of their extended boating family. I would recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a boat, especially newbies.< /Review>< rate>

Dr. Hakimi and her staff were very welcoming, professional and kind.  I would strongly disagree with the reviewer who stated that they were only motivated by profit; I brought our daughter to Dr. Hakimi to get a second opinion and she suggested that instead of having periodontal work now as the other periodontist recommended,  we wait until after our daughter has her braces on and see how it goes because she wasn't convinced that the procedure would be necessary.   Thank you Dr. Hakimi!</text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>We all know that if you have to see a periodontist you have a serious problem. I put off a gum graph for years due to horror stories of pain, misery and discomfort. Auburn is a drive for me.  It was well worth it for the level of comfort and care I received from the Dr. and staff.

Dr. Hakimi’s  gum grafting skills and modern  technique was astounding. I did not have any discomfort during the procedure and minimal pain after. I followed the post care directions exactly as explained. I had prepared myself for this horrific pain and misery to set in, but it never did.

I know all periodontist can due gum graphs however, I am convinced that not all periodontist have the same competent level of skill. The comfort during the procedure and outcome is based on the skill of the doctor and their assistants. Her skill set is proficient and absolutely amazing.

On my follow-up visit I was asked,  on a scale of 1-10 how was it?  I said,  a 2. Just for comparison in pain levels for me, root canal pain is an 8 and a dry socket is a 10++.

I now have learned to ask the most important question when I hear horror stories about periodontist procedures, who did you go to?  I recommend this doctor without hesitation.</Text>< Pictures>

Wonderful experience, yes at the dentist office.  Dr. Hakimi is very down to earth, she spends time explaining everything that her office can do for you. The dental hygienist Lori was wonderful, made me feel relaxed during a very long deep cleaning. Dr. Hakimi and her team of ladies were professional and made you feel as relaxed as you could be in a dentist chair🌷</text>

<Review>We can't say enough about Dr. Hakimi and her staff.  She performed a bone replacement graft for me in 2014 which was a complete success. Dr. Hakimi is extremely knowledgeable and professional and her staff are always professional yet very friendly and helpful.  Our family has regular checkups and cleanings here and have complete confidence that she cares about our periodontal health  as much as we do. We highly recommend this periodontist, her dental hygienist and all her staff.< /Review>< userid>

<Text>Dr. Hakimi And Her Staff Are AMAZING!

I had an extraction of an infected tooth and had bone grafting done to ready the site for a crown three weeks ago. Dr. Hakimi and her staff were very professional and worked quickly to get the tooth out since it was really bothering me. I can't thank them enough, I'm now pain free with no problems what so ever from the procedure or recovery. The three times I've been there the staff have always very welcoming and courteous to me and the other patients who where there. I am definitely recommending their office to my family and friends.<//Text>< pictures>

Dr. Hakimi is great! Periodontal surgery is a very specialized skill, and Dr. Hakimi has mastered the art. I appreciate her emphasis on communication and her knowledge of the techniques used for the best outcome. What people need to realize is if a periodontist is involved with their dental health, it usually means that there has been some problems the patient presented with. Dr. Hakimi does a great job providing the information required to take the next step in treatment. For this I appreciate her compassion and her consideration of all of my needs.< /Review>

I had 4 very difficult extractions done by Dr. Hakimi and was very impressed with my care. She and her staff are absolutely amazing and they care for each patient as an individual. I have nothing but respect and appreciation for Dr. Hakimi and her team. Great job!<//Review>

I have had problems with my teeth for years. I was referred to Dr. Hakimi, and though the prognosis was bleak,  Dr. Hakimi and her staff were amazing. I have never dealt with a doctor with so much compassion.  It was very hard for me emotionally to hear what needed to be done. Dr. Hakimi and her staff explained what and why these things needed to be done. I had major work done. My recovery was painless and went exactly how I hoped it would. They have stayed in contact with me throughout, managing my progression the whole time.  I still have 4-6 months before everything is complete. I cannot wait for the final results.  Thank you Dr. Hakimi and staff for making a very difficult time much easier, and for giving me the smile I have always wanted!!!< /review>

< review>
Approximately 10 years ago my wife had 3 implants done to the tune of about $20,000 by Dr. Hakimi when she had her offices in Roseville.  For approximately five  (5)  years the implants were trouble free,  but this last five  years have been a nightmare for my wife, , with constant bleeding and the need for intensive daily car and my wife has done her due diligence.  Of course, Hakimi since sold her Roseville practice  and moved to Auburn, leaving all  liability  behind. Today, the first of the implants had to be removed, to the tune of $3,800  and the prognosis for the remaining two implants is poor, at best    The removal was done by Dr. Vasanthan,
who bought Hakimi's business and is now in the business of cleaning up the carnage left behind  by Hakimi.  These people are motivated  by one thing and one thing only:  PROFIT!  Good luck to you all.

I, Robert L. Seyfried, husband of Jessica Seyfried, wrote the above most critical review while in a state of both anger and disappointment, perhaps predicated upon my lack of knowledge of how this dental business works.  About 10 years ago my wife came home with a professional proposal compiled by Dr. Hakimi and another Roseville dentist whose name I can't recall.  Including the three implants the total proposal came to approximately 20K.  Gulp!  .My wife then proceeded to have all of the work performed.  I accused Dr. Hakimi of charging Jessica 20K for the implants and Dr. Hakimi rightly informed me that the implants did not cost that much, although we no longer have records of their cost.  A few years back Jessica began having some problems with the implants and she phoned Dr. Hakimi's office only to learn that Dr. Hakimi had divested herself of the Roseville practice, had moved to Auburn and that, contractually, all work done previously by Dr. Hakimi was now the responsibility of her Roseville successor, or other periodontists.  This is not the culture that I come from and my lack of understanding as respects the legalities of the dental arena made me angry.  In rebuttal to my "tirade" Dr. Hakimi's assistant informed me of the 5 years contractual  statute as respects Dr. Hakimi treating her former Roseville patients and I also learned from the same rebuttal that 5 years might be a reasonable time before implants begin to fail.  Perhaps we should have known that prior to moving forward with the procedure.  Although my wife is angry with me for venting my frustration and anger and I do apologize to Dr. Hakimi for "losing it",  I must ask where does this end?  Dr. Hakimi's successor, Dr. "Ash" charged $3,800 to remove the first implant, plus the ancillary periodontal surgery to repair the receding gum line.

I guess I just don't understand this high level  dental care and, for my ignorance,I do apologize to Dr. Hakimi for those undue critical and offensive comments I may have made.

Sincerely.

That gravy is out of this world! We ordered Smothered pork chops, candied yams, cabbage, fried chicken. All delicious. It's a new business that gets busy, so the wait can be a little long. Totally worth it for the quality made to order food. The owner & her husband are very sweet. Me and my family love their food!!< /text>

I drove past on Long Beach to see a soul food place literally walking distance from my house. It being a little too warm to cook, we decided to try In The Kitchen.  Some people get upset when things are sold out, but in my book that just means, "Make an extra effort, it's that good." Missed out on Oxtail, but we had the smothered chicken and pork chops. Chicken Mac, cabbage, black eyed peas and red beans and rice were our sides.

Everything was seasoned to perfection. I could eat a bucket of that gravy alone. The cabbage was sweet and salty and the mac was outstanding and creamy. The service is fantastic. The people there are extremely kind and appreciative. The menu is small, but I rather like that since they stick to what they do best. What I do best is eat that stuff.

Welcome to the neighborhood folks. Keep making the good food and I will keep on eating it.</review>

<review>We had the smothered chops & fried chicken w/mac, greens, black eye peas, & red beans plus cornbread.

We split the meat to taste both. My smothered chops were awesome but the chicken needed salt. My black eye peas & greens slapped! His red beans needed salt & his mac was dry.

We will be back, tho.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQK2b4GWaZ40LsEFmva8HfJhq8RRAUPe_BJN2T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwdYqi8d5vOp0TRS60rz0zMsenM7IthBVBuAIX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODac3dgfLCsJ_UkAsq5z0vmsgPww5I-DQtghlo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPa7FpafGczahdETPQUgLWIGdhOOwrU03KrvgC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Date>

< Review>
I Always love to support black owned business And the owner and her husband are wonderful people love their attitudes and personalities were great very sweet people. but Me and my daughter was very disappointed because They took our order at 2:09 PM we didn’t get our food till 3:45 PM.Then they were calling us up telling us after 45 minutes of waiting, that they ran out of our items that we ordered. and then when we finally got our food, the chicken was delicious the Mac and cheese was not good and The gravy was the same. Big disappointment.< /Review>

Stopped in with my family while on a Saturday afternoon. Was informed that "ITK" had just catered an event and had a limited menu. Customer service was excellent. Friendly staff, Orders came out accurate, It was perfect.
Catfish was Excellent. Oxtail disappointing. Yams Bland. Red Beans and Rice Average. Peach Cobbler Amazing. Oxtail and Yams are my Two favorite things so I was disappointed overall. Will definitely go back for that catfish and Peach Cobbler.< /Text>

Highly disappointed yesterday. Not because of a food review but because there was no food to review!  Drove all the way from Pasadena to Long Beach only to be told the restaurant catered an event and only had so much of the menu to serve in the restaurant. Chock it up to experience for the restaurant I guess. I will try again another time.</review>

First Soul Food Experience and it was AMAZING! the Fried Chicken was crispy,juicy and full of flavor! The white beans was killer ! The cabbage was crunchy and just enough spice to want more and more! The mashed potatoes was PERFECTION ! the chicken mac was OUT OF THIS WORLD ! True definition of Soul Food.  I felt the love Nora and Bruce and we will be back ! In The Kitchen wont disappoint!< /Review>

<review>We decided yesterday to try this new soul food restaurant that was featured on KTLA the day before. We were met at the door by Ms Nora's husband who painfully delivered the news that they were out of food. My immediate response was "Wow!! How cool" I could tell he was surprised that I wasn't upset at all. I actually felt it was appropriate that they would sell out considering their segment on the news the day before. Ms Nora also took the time to speak with us and offered her sincere apologies that she could not serve us. She invited us to come back as soon as we can so that she could serve us. I definitely will try again soon. Congratulations IN THE KITCHEN!!!!

My first time going on Saturday the fried fish is absolutely delicious I don't know what seasoning they use but it's fried to perfection they cut all the bones out of the catfish the prices are about standard for soul food but they need a little time to get a little bit organized it was overwhelmed with orders and had to shut down for a little while to regroup but they're going to be a good soul food place for Long Beach.< /Review>

< review>
My 3rd visit to In The Kitchen was an UNPLEASANT experience.  I stood in line for awhile and finally my order was taken and I paid. After about 45 minutes I asked about my order and was told there are 20 orders ahead of me and could I come back tomorrow call first and I would be served. I come back the next day and was told they're busy with an catering order and to come back in an hour. I come back in the hour and was told my order is still not ready. I asked for my money back. I'm confused as to why I wasn't given my order at first and again the next day when other customers were given their orders.The food is awesome and Owner Ms. Nora is nice but the service I was given is unacceptable.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Okay. First of all I give this restaurant a five star for quality and freshness. I'm not sure if I was just starving by the time I got my food, but I dont really think that is the case. This food is really good. I have a regular restaurant I go to for my oxtail, so I was hoping I wasnt disappointed.  So glad I gave it a chance. I tried to buy a sample of everything.  I purchased Oxtail dinner with rice and greens. The greens were so good, I was tempted to go order another side order of them, but there is no way I was waiting in that long line. I came right when they opened so it wasnt too bad. I sat right in my car and ate my lunch... now it's back to work I go.For those of you who have complaints,  give them time to adjust. We gotta give our people constructive critiques without tearing them down.  Anyway, to continue on , I also ordered a side of fried chicken,  garlic mashed potatoes,  and yams. The meal also came with a giant cornbread muffin. I am stuffed. I tasted a little bit of everything in my bag. I will definitely go back for that fried chicken too . I saw that cast iron pot on the stove and knew it was gonna be somethin special, and it was that indeed. So well seasoned and crispy,  yet juicy inside. So worth the money I spent!<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Been around the world, military, civilian, and have worked with many shops that do repairs. I was recommended to have a bit of work done here, at A Plus, by a custom shop down the street. Now, I will GO TO NO OTHER PLACE, because A Plus Smog & Muffler is by far the most efficient, hardest working, and timely business in the Inland Empire. Steve, John, and the ENTIRE CREW have done more than exceptional work on my; Engine Mounts, Thermostat, Water Pump, Alternator - and the skilled customer service displays a highly trained, knowledgeable, informative, certified mechanical staff. Currently I had some sounds from my wheels,  (and they knew right away what they were working with) and now they are taking care of my Wheel Bearings and Tie Rode Ends! Good looking on the Brakes too, Steve!

Great work done at an incredible price. Fast, friendly and reliable, when you know the dealer should just tell you to come here, to A Plus, from now on!

Our family is ever grateful and feeling much safer driving our vessel!

Thank you A Plus, Respect.<//review>

<Review>Came here because they own the website mercedeskeyrepair.com and I needed a key for my Mercedes. They made me the wrong key which they then blamed on me for not specifying my car had keyless start. They then told me they couldnt even make the right key when I asked. They should be ashamed to call themselves mechanics.

Also when I asked on the phone if they used cheap Chinese keys they said they have Mercedes logos and are probably Mercedes keys, lol. Key does not have a mercedes logo and is obviously a cheap Chinese made key.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Been taking my cars here for past 8 yrs. Price is reasonable. Service is great. Mostly maintenance like brakes, oil changes, and smog checks. I always bring the cars in before any long distance trips. They keep my 2000 Nissan SUV, 2005 Toyota Tacoma and 2008 V8 running in top form.< /review>

Worst customer service ever. I paid $60 for a smog check which I didn't even pass.. then when I asked mechanic what was wrong with my car he said I had to pay another 100 dollars just to find out what was wrong with it.. no courtesy no customer service at all. Then they told me if I find out what's wrong with my car that I still have to pay another $60 to take the test again. In there own shop.... worst ever... I just got taken for my money....< /review>

We got towed here because the AAA lady recommend it. They charged $85.50 including a 10% AAA discount just to look at the car and tell us it needed a new transmission. Guy didn't even get dirty and made that munch is a matter of 3-5 minutes. Most of it was talking. This is ridiculous. We had our car towed home and the transmission repair was less than half the price we were given here.  Do not let AAA talk you into goimg here. PLEASE</Text>

One of the men from their shop stole my tools from the back of my truck and they admitted to taking them. They took advantage of their policy to exploit their customers. they are money hungry pigs and Jon B promised to reimburse me 50 when the tools are really worth 200+ dollars, and then when i called to ask when would be a good time to pick the money up he lowered it to thirty dollars and he had the females that work for him be his lil messenger he wouldn't even get on the phone to handle the matter. I kept asking why would he say 50 and then lie and say he never told me that and all i would get was 30. After this i do not want to deal with them at all. i would have given them half of a start but it wouldn't allow me. don't go here if you want good services. and i will be warning my friends and family about this place as well.

I will never come here ever again.  I came in about a month ago to get my alternator replaced. I literally waited almost 5 hours for them to complete the job. Ever since I got the car back from them the serpentine belt had been making a noise. It never made any noises before I took my car in. So I took my car to another mechanic and it turns out that they didn't put the serpentine belt on right and one of the pulleys has fallen off.< /text>

First off, been going here 10 years, replace water-pump twice, brake bleed initially, felt good with Christian ownership.   They let me bring own parts which was a plus.   Two years ago, got a rattle in exhaust, they replaced whole system with new muffler and cat.   Got engine code right after, they forgot to hook-up o-2 sensors, no biggy, fixed it myself.  Must add, welds on new exhaust were wonderful, I am a back-yard welder.  Here comes 2018, my jeep is telling me with code-reader that my sensor in distributor is bad, either camshaft or crankshaft, forgot, it is in distributor.   I take to my favorite place because state wants a smog check, the the heavy duty one required by state.  They oblige, I overhear owner telling his staff, "I might not make payroll next month."  He didn't know I heard him.  My Christian values sink in, tell the mechanic I have all these parts for radiator repair, why don't you put them in for me if cost is reasonable.  We agreed on price and felt good to help out shop.   I come back 2 hrs later, smog guy tells me it didn't pass, need new cat and O-2 sensors plus diagnostic.    I am astonished, my cat replaced by you two yrs ago with less than 2000 miles (this is a rock-crawler, very limited use) is bad?  He states those cats are cheap, don't last long.   I agree to replace o2 sensors because I have never replaced them (1997), told them to hold off on cat because there is no way it is bad after 2000 miles.  I get jeep back, tell me to drive for 50 miles to clear codes, for some reason, they replaced my number 1 cylinder spark plug, never asked why, forgot I replaced wires and plugs last year.   I take Jeep in next few days after putting miles on it to clear codes, nothing, codes never popped for me.    Amazingly, when smog guy starts up jeep he gets code for mis-fire on cylinder 1, can't do recheck until more repairs.   Needs total tune-up with wires and plugs.  I tell them to park jeep on side of street, will pick up and do work myself.   Order factory parts from mopar, took two weeks for back-order, did simple job myself and put 100 miles on it to clear codes.   My code reader showed no hits, very clear.  Take to shop for smog re-check, smog guy tells young guy to check for codes, tell customer he is late and will have to leave jeep.  Jeep is a play-toy, was planning on leaving and always tell them to take your time, no hurry.   Overhear code reader tell smog guy, who is busy, say codes are clear.   I wait for an update for a few minutes, code-reader guy approaches and states your system has not cycled, drive it for many more miles.    At this time I know this is not the same shop I have spent thousands of dollars at, a sham.  I drive it 2 miles west, have another shop test and it passes easily, cat is 0%, no issues at all.   Don't go here, either not same Christian owner, or went sleazy.<//text>

Had a big discrepancy with this place and rated it with one star until they called me to apologize, communicate what had happened and offered to rectify the situation.  I'm really surprised and grateful for their effort.  I will be taking my car in for a free oil change and see how that goes.  Until then I will re-rate them with 4 stars.< /review>

For a 10 by 15 at Darrell's is  A $130 for a 10 by 15 at Glen will save you $40 A no brainer for the price.  Beware Uhaul will try to sell you a storage and say it's not available when you give him the size so they can up sell you for bigger one if they don't have it they will try to sell you two storages. Good luck<//review>

<Review>We had a bike, ladder and a dolly stolen from here. We had asked if they had cameras that might've caught anything and they told us that they would check and get back to us and they never did. The odd thing was that the lock was never broken, but it had been changed on us. But we took our stuff and left but were not coming back here again to put up storage.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

First adventure in a year to a bar. The outdoor sitting was spacious with some tables with umbrellas. The wait staff service was excellent and attentive. The beer selections was fulfilling and tasty. There was a Mexican taco truck available for an epicurean delight paired for beer tasting. The bill for two was perfect for a delightful afternoon.<//review>

Great atmosphere! Arrived at about 4 PM and all tables were taken but the nice guy working there rolled out a barrel for us to stand at while we waited. Mexican food truck was very good but waited about 45 minutes to get our food. Great selection of beer and they have plenty of space heaters outside but still... bring a warm jacket because after 5pm it was windy and freezing.<//Review>

As California opened and re-closed a couple of times, Belching has gotten smart and added much more outdoor seating. Each day is something different, from pizza to burritos, BBQ to hot dogs.  All the food is great and we have our favorites (and maybe not so favorites) - but the beer is ALWAYS flowing.<//Text>

I didn’t know this BB existed in Oceanside. It’s really nice and big. I love the patio space and how it’s not DG and it’s paved for your dog, so your dog doesn’t have to get dirty. They also allow dogs inside. They started making their own spiked seltzer. Which was okay. I do like the big space! I like this location better then vista but it doesn’t have its own kitchen which is cool, there’s a good truck though.<//Review>

Belching Beaver is a very unique brewery. They do a lot of experimental beers here, which are all amazing! Some of the beers I sampled at the brewery were the mango IPA, peanut butter milk stout, mosaic double IPA, orange vanilla IPA and the IPA collaboration they did with the Deftones. They also have a good selection of bombers and cans for sale at the brewery for a reasonable price. This location is kid and dog friendly too. I highly recommend this spot.<//review>

Good beer (mostly IPAs and stouts though). Plenty of space to be with good people. Usually a truck outside for food.<//review>

This place is awesome! We were here for a fundraiser for San Diego Humane Society, and it was a lot of fun. Tons of great people, dogs and great beer. Can't ask for a better spot to spend a Saturday afternoon.<//review>

Who knew this Oceanside gem existed!? Cool open warehouse brewery tucked away in an industrial park. Fresh beer on tap in a cool environment with lots of room for seating and indoor games, trivia, and more. Definitely worth visiting.<//Text>

<Text>Best place to try the latest and greatest of Belching Beaver brews! Relaxed and inviting atmosphere. Food trucks available almost daily, but you're welcome to bring your own food if there isn't one. Dog and kid friendly. They also host bingo night on Tuesdays and trivia night (with Sunset Trivia) on Wednesdays. Plenty of parking. Only downside is on busy nights, seating can be hard to find. But otherwise, great place for catching up with friends, a drink after work, game night, or all of the above!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

We we're visiting family from out of state and located the brewery with a Google search. There were three people in our group.  We each tried a flight of four beers, and of course shared a few. I did not have one bad beer.  So glad we made the detour after visiting the beach!<//text>

Great beer and space, but the BBQ was the most overpriced and under-portioned I have ever had.  It was delicious, but $20 for a standard size paper plate with two chicken tenders three bits of brisket, a quarter cup of pulled pork and a bunch of Mac n cheese is ridiculous.  It’s too bad because it used to be a real BBQ portion that could feed two people.</review>

Like most microbreweries in San Diego it has very limited options for non-drinkers. The soda machine was out of both non caffeinated sodas. The bartender was friendly and accommodating and offered me a soda when he saw the machine didn't work so that was definitely a plus on the service side.

If you do enjoy breweries and beer, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at the Belching Beaver.< /text>

Amazing beer and amazing people.  Known for their Peanut butter milk stout, but they have great IPAs, hazy beers, barrel aged stuff, and even sour beers.  One of the best breweries in SD, or anywhere else.  I highly recommend them.<//review>

< Review>
Two good, two not so good experiences. Beer selection is mostly IPAs and stout variations, a couple others sprinkled in, good beers. If you're into the amber or red style your sol. Bartender gave me a sample one visit then never returned to see if I wanted one, my girlfriend finished her beer while the bartender finished his.
** we have since returned and found the service to be much better.<//Review>

Hang out in a family and pet-on-a-leash friendly place. Excellent beer, ample parking, rotating food trucks, and pretty chill folks await you.</Review>

< Review>
One of the belching beavers around Oceanside and Vista. 25% of this place is the bar and 75% is the actual brewing, packing and barrel storage. There are picnic tables, barrels to out your beer on and stand around, and a wrap around bar.

You can bring your dog, children and even play some corn hole or various other games that are behind the bar. A nice place to grab a delicious beer with friends. I enjoy all of their sour beers and the interleague ipa.

There are often food trucks available also!</Review>

First time to Oceanside for Beer, now I fell like I should dive in here more often, My beer town is at Miramar Area where is the melting point of micro breweries of San Diego. The ambiance is wonderful and location is very isolated and quite.

Belching Breaver beer are brewed to the Perfection. The warehouse is hard to find but its BIG, lot of space to relax and have fun.

Getting there:
Lost Abbey is really lost in San Macros, it is hard to find. Follow the directions carefully.
It's Hard to find. It is literally Lost, all the way behind few commercial buildings.

Beer Choices: Good, ~ 15 taps
*** Top 5 Beers (No-Particular Order) ***
Not my favorite places for beer, tried 4-5 beers but none was impressive.
Beavers Milk Stout: Best Basic Milk Stouts: Nice roasted flavor, very basic & no adulteration.
The Mayor - Scotch Ale W Maple, Coffee and Vanilla
OL' dirty Barrel - Bourbon Barrel aged imperial stout.
Peanut Stout
Me so Honey, decent Pale Ale

***Ambiance***
The atmosphere is like a big picnic area with lot of picnic tables and bar stools.
Lot of Fun stuffs to do, Bean bag toss, Jenga.
One small TV near the Wall Menu.

***Prices***
The prices varies on beer the range is below
Taster size: $2
Half pour size: $3-$4
Full size pour: $5-$7
Growler: $16-$20
(Growler fills are priced as 40 oz and 64 oz fills only)

***Food***
Food truck, pretty good ones.

***Try this***
Lot of Fun stuffs to do, Bean bag toss, Jenga.

***Highs***
Nice and Big setup, picnic like.
Pet Friendly

***Lows***
NOT GREAT BEERS

Hoping to come again and try different beers and update my ratings.

Big Shout out for Ritz the bartender, very friendly indeed.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Pleasant surprise to find this place by chance on a Saturday afternoon. This hotel is located in an industrial area around San Diego, a casual place with excellent beers.

(Original)
Grata surpresa encontrar por acaso este local num sábado a tarde. Fica em uma zona industrial ao redor de San Diego, local informal e cervejas de excelente qualidade.</Review>< Pictures>

Everything is almost gone, except for all the furniture in the baby section, but all the displays and furniture is still priced too high.  The items are being moved to the front of the store and unless you ask they won't let you go to the back and check out the displays.  Its all very messy in the back and everyone is just running around.  The cashiers are very moody and bad attitude with a serious ugly face.  Such bad customer service.  They don't know anything if you ask.< /review>

<review>I met this amazing woman named Cathy Who was either a manager customer service but definitely an employee wearing a red shirt on December 23, 2016 at The toys are us in Santa Cruz California. She made my granddaughter's wishes come true even though they seemed impossible. Thank you Kathy with all my heart. God bless you.< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>The store is the largest toy store around Santa Cruz. They have a great selection of toys, baby supplies,  Nursery furniture, games, a whole video game section, arts and crafts, and down to candy! The store pretty much has got it all but the only problem is is that it is closing down, I'm unclear as to why a huge company is shutting down..... Im thinking it was an inside job🙄😜 Bummer. Does everyone only shop online now!!??? I don't want to.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Make sure you do NOT have to use the restroom and make sure children use the restroom BEFORE you arrive. It is not the place you want to be if you need to use the restroom. Filthy at all times of the day INCLUDING opening and always poorly stocked. It's very challenging for someone with small children to make sure they "don't touch that"! Yes, it's bad enough to note in a review.

Pricing labels are poorly placed on the shelves and you REALLY have to check the SKU #s to make sure you have the correct item.  Yes, it's a toy store and of course children are going to want to play. I do sometimes too. Still, all-in-all, the store is physically a mess.

All that being said, sales associates are helpful to the point where they will search in the back and climb ladders to find items that are not on the shelf but the inventory device says there's 1 more in stock. can be a little on the shy side, they do what they can to help. I'd say 9 times our of 10 they can find it. They're usually cheerful and almost always willing to talk about their favorite toys.<//text>

<review>I was assisted by Cathy Kern on 3/18/15.  I asked her to help me find a gift that an 8-yr. old boy would really be happy to receive.  She showed me many versions of Legos and together we settled on one that I thought Rudy would really like.

When I gave Rudy the gift his first response was, "How did you know that I wanted this so badly?"

I thank Cathy for her time, care and patience in finding the perfect 8-yr. old boy toy!
Toys R Us is lucky to have such an attentive and caring employee who both greeted and assisted me!

Sincerely,

I have been here many times and have never had any problems. The staff are always helpful and they almost always carry whatever I am looking for at the time!</Review>

Got a "warranty" along with my son's tablet. A few months later it broke and we expected them to honor the replacement warranty. No such luck. In fact, they had no record of it at all. Went back four or five times with no one able to help. Going to buy another tablet somewhere else. What a waste of money.</Text>

As I go to purchase they say that the game isnt available for over a week. The game is already out and no one could help me/let me purchase the game. Seems like their hands were tied but it speaks loads on what kind of company they are. The game is out, you have it in stock and you still refuse to sell it to me? Incompetent. Stupid.

My grandson loves this place.  The workers are nice.  They have all sorts of comics and action figures.  They have a new gaming section.  They also have T-shirts.  It warrants a look.< /review>

Really cool place. A lot bigger on the inside than the store front led me to believe. They are currently expanding and adding a gaming room. They have comic's, pokemon cards, magic the gathering cards, posters, sports cards, action figures, vintage video games, board games, Pop dolls, and tons of other collectables. Stop by and take a look. Support small business.</review>

Great comic shop. Has a wide selection of items. Figures, comics and books. They hold D&D tournaments and other card games as well.

You must call the store for details about days and times.< /Review>

<text>Fantastic comics shop. Amazing Employees and just an overall fun place to get comics or some graphic novels at. I've been trying to go every week since the store opened just because of getting feed back on certain comics and stories. The people who work there are very friendly and easy to talk to. I would recommend to anyone who reads comics or just want to a quick read to stop by and check it out. You won't regret it.</text>< pictures>

Went to pick up my wish order... Kinda far from my house so I waited for my Dr appointment at Kaiser to go.... But if rather go a little further away and get great service then get someone rude.. So 10 thumbs up for the very patient young man that so pleasantly sold me a redbull and dr pepper.. Didn't catch his name but very impressed with the work ethic. Oh and getting my package in a timely manor.. Great way to get ur store noticed as well... I would have known about this place. Now because of wish and the great attitude of the associate at Atomic Comic I will now have a place to refer my friends to.. Remember store owners , supervisors and employees... PEOPLE WILL WANT TO RETURN IF U SMILE AND BE NICE...<//text>

The Owner helps you with what you are looking for and will also order it for you if it's not in the store. Also the membership is totally worth it and inexpensive so its a great way to help out a local comic shop</Text>

Terrible experience. Store owner had a complete mood swing during a trip to his store. Really recommend pursuing another comic store. I've seldom had nights ruined by a trip to a comic book store and this place took the cake. Try Comic Hero University which is in Fullerton. Even if it's maybe a little bit of a drive for you, its a much better environment. I doubt this shop will be open long as they clearly don't know how to run a comic book store, so if you're a collector in this hobby, build a relationship elsewhere with a decent owner who interacts better with customers.< /review>

{'time': 1541227766150, 'text': "This entire review was fabricated and looks to be self serving. It’s a shame they allow negative reviews to go up like this without someone checking it out. I’m the owner, and I have not had any mood swings at my shop. That’s just not the way I run my business nor do I live my life that way. Come and check us out for real, and you’ll see. As outspoken as you are, you'd think you would have a lot of reviews out there, but this is the first review for your account. This account was obviously made to discredit the competition. Sad. Treat your customers well, and you won't have to badmouth the competition. There's more than enough to go around."}< /response>

Wow.....I am Completely Impressed by this shop! The Owner (Eric) whom I spoke with,was very knowledgeable overall, and very cool listening to my ramblings about many characters, newer titles, and my missing editions etc...plus,a bit of extra  time to chat with me when I brought  up my older and rare figures and collectables I wanted to sell or had too many questions about! His shop blew me away with fully stocked new titles,limited runs,and issues thought by alot to be lost,and not seen again, plus a vast selection of Inde,dark,and imported comics Ive not read or heard from  in quite some time! Atomic Comics  actually came RECOMMENDED from A Competitor! That's why his shop is  amazing! Check this shop out for FREE COMIC DAY,and thumb thru all the New,Used,and Rare reasonablely priced gems,maybe even admire or purchase one of many signed/ limited versions or titles you "used to have," or never had the opportunity to buy?
This shop is truly The One Above All...🌌</Text>

{'time': 1557100556084, 'text': 'Thanks for the review, Adam. I wish you were specific because I hear I often price my hard-to-find figures under the market price. I do have a collection of over 15,000 older comics to choose from that range from $1.50 to $1,300, but those are priced by comic condition using the Overstreet price guide and/or Ebay pricing. Most comics are less than what you can get them on Ebay, depending on the condition. I also have about 2,000 comics that are in the $1 bin. The new comics are cover price unless you get the $20/year membership, and then you get 15% off all new comics and up to 50% off the comics in the bins. For collectors, the $20 membership fee is well worth it, especially for those coming in every Wednesday to get their new comics. Comic stores can\'t really afford to sell at yard sale prices if they want to stay in business. If we don\'t make a profit, then we can\'t pay the lease, the lights, the employees, etc. This is why you often hear the phrase, "Help support your local comic book store." Many go out of business because they can\'t compete with the online businesses that don\'t have to pay for the lease, lights, employees, etc. I know we all like a "deal," which is why we offer the membership for $20 so you can feel like you\'re getting a "deal" every time you come. I think most comic book stores have some sort of membership to help keep customers loyal so it\'s not unheard of to have this at our store. Thanks again for the review.'}< /resp>

<Review>This smart and final store really deserves a 5 star rating due to the following reasons:

1. Selection is really wide and have everything and I mean everything that other supermarket has only at a  much better quality.
2. Prices are actually cheaper than a regular super market.
3. Parking is very ample
4. Customer service is friendly and helpful
5. Restroom are super clean
6. Other shoppers are even friendly which is a rare thing now days.

I highly recommend this particular store.</Review><rating>5< /rating><UserId.>102124323600368986959</UserId.>< user_name>

Worst smart & final ever! They have rotten everything. I'm disgusted by their food and customer service is just as rotten as their food.. and I will be calling corporate on them... they better get it together! I wish i could give it no stars! Supervisors are horrible ... I will never shop or try to shop there again! I might even report them to health & safety.... everything had mold cauliflower, brocolli, bell peppers... ect ect... what a shame of a store...<//text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>S&F is a good place to go for quick needs . They are by far not a low price outlet . I wish they would get away from you having to buy  multiple items to get a reasonable price. They would be a great place to shop if they would accept their competitors advertised  prices on " same' brand items. "Food 4 Less" is still a good place for lower prices. I'm just saying!!!< /Text>< Pics>

Love this store. It's becoming my neighborhood favorite. Even though most items are sold in bulk., you still can pick up a head of lettuce or milk, etc.</Review>

Went yesterday to get some good food specifically fresh veggies, fruits and kids mid-snack. This grocery store is really nice and clean. You'll find all people respect the new 6 ft rule. Well, people have mask for protection as well. Good to know we are all taking care of ourselves and others too.</Review>

Well stocked with meats,produce dairy and dry goods and bulk items.Good sale items.I especially appreciate the single feeder line to checkout Social distance markers are on the floor You are called the next available register.The line moves quickly.If one checker is handling a large order another checker calls you .You won't get bogged down especially if you only have a few items< /text>

<date>1566389976341</date><rating>3< /rating><Review>Yesterday August 20 I came into the Smart and Final in Bixby Knolls #745 and purchased #202 the least amount of items I ever purchased. My issue was with my water purchase - I had a coupon 35 bottles for 1cent - great right ? Well I ended up paying full price - I had the coupon on my phone but the cashier was unable to scan it because she said “the coupon was not straight “so the little red light could not pickup the bar code, my mistake - I felt like my purchase wasn’t valuable enough for attention from management- she should have tried to make an afford to give my purchase at the discounted price instead she charged me full price to get me out the line — Very poor customer service skills- thinking on her feet should have been her job to help me and holding up the line should have been mine- but I’m one of those nice considerate seniors that people really don’t like spending too much time with - speak to her about this Jason it certainly would make customers satisfied and I do love this store it is always so clean and neat — Thank you.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Time>1563589530868</Time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>After years of periodically shopping for this company. This has been the worst shopping experience i ever had. When have cashiers scanned carts not one time but 3 times while i waiting in line. I asked cashier Adriana when did you guys starting scanning carts? her response was due to security. My next question was security for what? Cashier couldnt answer the question. To mind you the customer in front of me cart didnt get scanned at least i didnt see that. what a way to make a customer feel very uncomfortable. Im not the one to leave reviews at all but the feeling of being discriminated while shopping for your company had to be noticed. I will never recommend anyone to shop at this location. My first and my very last. I most definitely did contact corporate with cashier name and time i shop at this location. I couldnt get the other cashier to left of her name but im sure she will get notified as well. The second cashier to left of her stopped her whole transaction just to scan my cart. while she had a customer plus a line with other customers to attend to. Very un professional ladies having such judgement shows what kind of individuals you are.You both should not work at any company especially with that judgement towards people. You both need coaching better on how to elevate your customer service.< /Review>< Response>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Worst Smart and Final ever. I own a business so I come here a few times a week. I buy meet here often. Every time I come I have to ask them for more items since they dont check shelves. You have to buy 50 or 70 lbs of meat for the sales price bit they will display only 20 lbs and you will have to spend 30 mins asking and waiting to get more. 8 out of 10 trip I have to do that. Not fun.

Every time I buy items 50% off I always ask cashier to make sure they get it, even that only half of the time they do. You have to spend 10 mins waiting for them to get it right.

Today same thing, I wanted beef at 50 lbs for wholesale price but they had 25 and nobody was around. I cane up to cashier ( 1 cashier was opening) and the guy called meat department, he said he would go back and check. 10 mins unasked if he went to get the beef somewhere else or where why it takes him so long. Cashier said He doesnt know I will have to wait. I said Actually I dont have to and I walked out, left all items in the cart and bags. I just left.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I really liked this store until I was charged a different price for a pie that was labeled $3.49 and register charged $5.49! I didnot notice the discrepancy until the next day. I should have paid attention, but i was talking to the cashier who was complaining she was scheduled to work all day Easter Sunday. She has children. The point is this is dishonest. How many more products are charged more than the labeled price? NOT COOL, VERY DISHONEST! Bait and switch!!

So i decided to gv this store another chance. Twice i went back to have the alarm and cart freeze when i exited the door AFTER I PAID FOR MY ITEMS. I ALMOST TRIPPED ON THE CART. I opened my purse to prove I HADNT STOLEN ANYTHING. Well the cashier is supposed to scan the cart as well as your groceries so this will not happen.  2 times this happened to me. Seriously how many times do i overlook this?</Review>< Rate>

Our associates are supposed to scan the barcode on the bottom of all shopping carts. Please know your feedback is very important to us and we will use it to improve future experiences. If you'd like to share any additional details, please email customer.relations@smartandfinal.com."}</response>
< Review>
I’ve had the same experience but never reported it but to see it wasn’t just me targeted action definitely need to be taken because they can’t explain why they are scanning the carts    next time try hiring some people with respect and class discrimination isn’t cool I will never to back to this store<//Review>

They've changed their hours to 4 am to 12pm.  This is the best bakery!    If you show up in the early morning, they have a delicious croissant breakfast sandwich, coffee, and donut of your choice for $6.29.  The croissants are made with real butter so they are flaky and delicious.  The owners are very friendly and make you feel welcome.  If you look closely, you will find the "regulars" meet there almost every day.  What better recommendation could you have than that?< /Text>

Believe it or not we go here for their salads to go, ..one of my favorite lunches! If we feel like a  splurge.. they have the best fresh croissants. They have awesome breakfast sandwiches as well as a large selection of donuts and cinnamon rolls also, good coffee. This is owned by such a nice young couple. They put in a lot of hours to serve our community, and always have a smile.😁</Review>

Best donuts in town! Great selection / variety and they're not stingy with the frosting. Donut holes are one of my favorites, and theirs always have a nice thick glaze.</Review>

The eggs, cheese, ham, and bacon on a croissant was delicious and a hardy breakfast.  I could easily have split this with my wife.   Less than $4.00 and definitly worth it...<//review>

<text>The best donuts in Santa Maria. Don't bother with any other donut shop. Main Street Donuts taste fresh and all their donuts have the right amount of chocolate or maple frosting. All the other donut shops in Santa Maria have brick donuts with little frosting.</text>< pics>

<Review>I am so happy that Petco sells Just Food for Dogs. I live in orange county and was staying at my cabin in Crestline. We decided to stay longer and I needed more food for my dog. I called and the person on the other end was really friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. They checked to see if they had the Beef and Russet Potato and yes they did. He even asked if I needed directions to the store. I drove from my cabin and bought the food. I am so happy to know that Petco carries Just Food for Dogs and that the employees at the Fontana store are friendly and helpful.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Love the trainer here (Sarah Samson)! I highly recommend her. Great return policy, which I appreciate, because I have a picky eater for a pet. They are downsizing tho, so their selection will be affected by that.

HEADS UP: Their closing time on Google is incorrect for Sundays. I was there last night and they had this sign on the window. Which clearly reads 10 AM - 6 PM. This might be temporary, due to the remodel.< /text>< response>

I really like the different brands of pet food Petco offers and my favorite brand for my dogs is Whole hearted. Really great brand of healthy dog food. Purchasing online is simple and reordering what I purchased the last time is so easy. And its so convenient to have the option to pick up my order from the store and have curbside pick up service.</review>

Whenever you want to but a fish or small animal, they always criticize your setup. I went with my mother today and she was offended on how they treated her when she just wanted 2 Neon fish.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Just moved to the area, and this petco is definitely the coolest I've been in. The fish section blows my other city's petco out of the water! I bought a dog toy... my dog destroyed it in seconds. I was so discouraged and felt bad trying to take it back but the guy didn't make me feel weird at all! No questions asked, gave me a refund without any awkwardness. I will DEFINITELY be back to get stuff for our dog, cat, and fish.< /review>< pictures>

Had everything I needed except for an aquarium light that was out of stock until Fri. These things happen. No need to lower the score for that. The people very very responsive and friendly. I had to return a light that was the wrong size and the experience was very easy.<//Review>

We took my great dane to this place and we payed 90 dollars for a desheding a wash and a nail cutting. The wash and nails look fine. But when we got home he had so much hair my black pants were full of his white hair and since my dog didn't want to go in a crate we are not allowed back here.</text>

Everybody was great!  But just a lot of merchandise not there!  Everything I went for was out!  Is it Covid and not getting deliveries or poor ordering?!  This has been happening with a lot of Petcos for a while!< /Review>

<Text>I am a new pet parent, I walked into the store with the idea of just picking up a good choice of puppy food. I was lost until I reached out to Jennifer, she took the time to school me on becoming a pet parent and the essentials, highly recommending the right diet for my puppy and its breed. I was able to walk  out with a great choice of food, a crate/kennel, some toys, treats,  leash and collar and puppy name tag. I was delighted to receive so much information and help while shopping. I am well satisfied with the customer service and my Ivy (my puppy) thanks the team!<//Text>< pics>

I needed to buy some dog food for the poodle and fish supplies. I selected the fluval 307 canaster filter. Didn't work out because it leaked from the sides and the center connections? I worked on that filter for an hour and the leak never stopped. I took it back and exchanged with no problem. Replaced filter with another brand now works perfectly. The dog is happy and so are my litle tigers.</Text>

The Manager Jennifer at this location is very rude and has completely made me never want to step foot on another petco ever again. I’m a disabled veteran and treat everyone with dignity and respect but Her nasty demeanor and non-helpful attitude makes me wonder how she ever gained a leadership position in the first place. Jennifer should wear a name tag that says Karen because that’s what she is. Completely disrespectful and disgusting person.</Review>

The prices in most stores like Petco are very inflated. This location was small but that wasn't bad at all. I just didn't like the price of my purchase.< /text>

Employees here are actually friendly and happy to help you and your pets. I personally bring my dog to their training class and grooming and I love their service. Classes have been very fun and progressive. With grooming I love that they take their time and actually pamper my dog then go over everything they did and actually show me. They also have a great rewards program. Very worth  joining if you shop here frequently.<//text></record>

Cashier assisted me with getting a good deal/discounts using the price matching option. This was an extreme help to me as I have two great danes, three cats (one who's sick so i was buying wet food for her)  and a leopard gecko. This really helped me purchase all the items I needed without overdrawing my account or having to sacrifice any items.</text>

Not even my boyfriend could push the little clips into place.  Especially in the condition she is in I wouldn't want to move her too much. I wouldn't recommend it. Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is the employee helped me look for the cone and it's well organized and a clean store.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Everyone (customers and service staff) are always very friendly when I go in there. The only thing I have an issue with is when I tried to order an item online, Petco said the item was available for pick up at the store that same day.
I do not trust anything so I called the store and mentioned that I wanted to order the item online and wanted to make sure the store had the item for pick up. The lady checked and said the item was not available. I told her that the website mentioned the item was available for pick up. When I asked her why the inventory was not matching what the website said, she told me that it can take a few days for the website to show whether or not the item is truly available. That is not acceptable, especially when people are depending on online ordering and curbside/store pick up a lot more these days. That is the reason I removed 2 stars. Otherwise, shopping there has been great over the years.<//text>

<text>So if you want to buy anything in the store make sure you double check the prices online. The store prices will always be much HIGHER than the prices PETCO has on their OWN web site. I bought the k9Advatage flea medicine for my dog and at the store it was $49.99, but on the PETCO web site the SAME item was $26.99!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c34c1c51509669:0x45628212fee0017e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They dont return calls as the recording says they will. I try to book online as they recommend on voice msg, But there are 0 appts available( Anyday,, any time, even couple weeks out). I have tried numerous times in the past months, way b4 COVID, And they never have returned my calls. When I have had luck to get through & my call gets transferred to them, they drop the calls even after couple attempts. Bad customer service( Grooming Dept) !!! Regardless, if they are too busy, they should improve their customer service and appt availability ( if on- line)!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>BUYER BEWARE!!!!  If Petco sells you an item right now that is either broken, or incorrectly described, or any of the other reasons that are no fault of the customer, they will NOT allow you to return it and get your money back.  I understand the concern, but if you are open for business to take my money, you surely need to give people their money back for return that is out of our control.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I enjoy going to Petco but I believe their customer service over the phone can use some improvement. I called a few weeks ago and they answered the phone as if I was calling a friend. The words the gentleman said we're very short. "hello" "yeah". The professionalism wasn't there and he was not too knowledgeable on some things which is not too terrible.< /Text>

I don't buy much from them but I do buy my hamsters from them because they seem to live for a longer time. I've had a hamster live for almost 9 years.

I searched online for a certain pet food. Once I found the pet food that I wanted to buy, I called Petco to see if it was in stock. Unlike my experiences when I either called or visited Walmart, the sales associate at Petco searched the shelves, located the product and gave me the prices, the different  quantities the regular prices and sales prices. After a busy day at work, I just wanted to go into the store, but what I needed and head home, so this was very helpful. Thank you, Petco for providing great customer service<//Text>

<Review>This Petco is awesome! I regularly take my dogs for grooming. I have a small chihuahua mix and a medium Labrador mix. I have always been able to get an appointment for both of them at the same time. They keep excellent records on their treatments and my preferences, so they always get the same level of service with each visit. The staff are friendly and interact with my dogs, lovingly. I appreciate the hard work that they put in. Go GROOMING!! Pamela is really good and she's super sweet. My dogs really like her. I also frequent the aquarium section and they are beyond great! They are knowledgeable, courteous and helpful. They are able to answer all of my questions and keep the area clean and well stocked. I sometimes pay a little more for some products here ( as compared to other discount stores). That's because the service is exceptional.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Great store. Good prices. I shop both pet smart and pet co , prices are nearly the same. I'm just curious why I bought a rolling pet food container , and didn't get the wheels included. :/ I would like to receive them. I didn't realize it until now, bought it earlier this month at this location. *scratches head*<//text>

I've had pleasant experiences the few times I've been here, but nothing special. That's why they get 3 stars. I'll continue to shop there as long as it's the closest one if its kind to my house.</text>

I love the cookies that they sell for my puppies. Staff is awesome as well. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that they sometimes run out of large crickets.<//review>

Petco has really stepped it up!  They have a wide variety of grain free dog food and treats.  The dogs apparel and toys are really unique and fun.  The layout of the store is really fun!< /text>

I go here at least once a month for fish food. I keep bala sharks in 100 gal tank. They are about 6in long now x 4 of them. I feed the frozen blood worms and shrimp. They love it. Good place to shop, prices are about the same as everywhere else.< /Text>

<Text>I've been shopping here for years and each time I leave a happy customer. I had questions regarding my dogs diets and was thoroughly answered and provided possible examples of what to get.

I also had questions about my pet birds laying eggs. To my surprise there was an employee who's speciality is birds. Whenever I need advice or supplies for my pets, I know I can always come here.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Do not adopt from these people, they breed their cats to make money. Freakin ridiculous! And selfishness there's so many damn cats. And they charge 125$, the cats aren't all fixed when you adopt them. You have to take then yourself. And they don't have all their shots. It's just ridiculous. Shame on them and Petco for allowing this. This woman Dee said herself that the cats are from her cat.

They've had problems with lack of staff recently. Waited 30+ minutes just to get fish, even after going to the front to ask for help. When someone finally came to help they helped the people who came 20 minutes after us. All the staff is great, but there's just not enough of them. Had a similar problem a couple weeks ago. You can't expect 2 people to  handle an entire store. Multiple groups of people left when no one helped them.<//Text>

The first scratcher is already significantly being worn out by my cats!  I don't think this one will last a couple of weeks.  The last scratcher I purchased from Amazon lasted at least 2 months.< /text>

Staff are almost always friendly.  I just wished they did not sell animals at any petstore. Stop caging all animals.  Let's live life enjoying animals as they are free, and wild.< /review>

<Review>You don't get the friendly greeting from the staff here as you would any other store. Instead of the employees being so eager to help you, you have to go and look for one. I mean come on it's a small location. You don't think that you would have to look that hard.</Review>< userid>

<text>Customer service has much to be desired. I just got done shopping there again. My opinion has changed. A gentleman by the name of Chad helped me so much today.He educated me on things about Petco. They are trained on food and animals. I am disabled so it's hard to lift the food,so his help was greatly appreciated< /text>< Pics>

Went here looking for a hamster, met a worker named Josie who cares for the hammies. We had a bad experience with a hamster at a PetSmart where the employee mishandled the hamsters, so we came here hoping for a better experience. And we got what we asked for, Josie was the best help and gave us guidance on the friendliest hamsters and each of their personalities. She was so smart and considerate and wouldn't let just anyone leave with a hamster. The absolute best customer service I've ever experienced and I will continue giving them my business. I hope Josie gets good marks for her amazing service and intelligent marketing ❤️< /Text>

A gentleman by the name of Chad helped me so much today.He educated me on things about Petco. They are trained on food and animals. I am disabled so it's hard to lift the food,so his help was greatly appreciated< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c34c1c51509669:0x45628212fee0017e</gmapID></record>

<Text>Staff is always very accommodating! I'm a senior citizen with numerous pets (large dog, cats, birds) and limited for medical reasons on what I can lift. Staff always greats me immediately and asks what I need on this visit. They take me to it, lift it into the cart for me, advise me of any new items they think may interest me and conclude by putting my purchases into my car.</Text>< Rate>

<text>Has a great selection on accessories for any of pets, especially the small pers like rodents and reptiles. Over all a good experience no one really bothers you; but if you are not a casual person you will get a bit of a cold shoulder (but who's not used to that)< /text><Rate>4</Rate>< GmapID>

I find the staff is always very helpful and ready to provide assistance with answering questions, making suggestions and lifting heavy items for me. Plus, it's nice that you can also take your animal inside if you want.</Review>

It was nice but the food selection was very little. It's either had blue cheese on it or it was all spicy .I'm not one that likes blue cheese or too spicy of stuff.< /text>

Went in for dog vaccinations, which wasn't to bad.  The the line was long but the vet staff was nice.  However the staff at petco not so friendly. One gal was upset cause there was dog poop on the floor, but really you work at a pet store.  Plus I helped clean it and it wasn't my pet. I happen to be the lucky one to step in it going round the corner, yuck.<//Text>

I have been coming to this petco for over 5 years never had a problem with the staff .. I started using the grooming service for my baby girls as well. Today I had the worst experience they had a rush of people come in and they helped my husband and I with getting my girls nails done when I notice it was very quick once we got her back and checked her nails there was blood all over her paw . The grooming lady didn’t even bring it up we had to go back and tell her about it . And she didn’t even apologize. I haven’t seen my baby bleed like that from a nail ever! Now I’m scared she could get an infection from it. And after all of this they asked me to tip her.. lol like, I will give you a tip yeah I tip you to go get re-train. Never will I bring my baby here again . She is not just a dog she is my baby . My kid. They are family . To them they maybe just another dog but to us they aren’t! They are my kids! Lost my business!< /Text>

The first time that I went I thought that they were very nice the cashier answered  a lot of my questions which were about live plants, and she told me when to come back when they get there fish shipment, is usually when the new plants come in I went back that Wednesday to check like she told me to do and another worker told me there was no such thing Okkkkkkkkkayyyyy, I still patronized the store and went back again as I stood inline the cashier was ringing someone else up in front of me and she started motioning with her index finger and I looked behind me and asked what,( couldn't hear what the finger said) She said stand over there that is where the line is because she did not want other customers to come in and get nervous, I understood where she said she wanted the line, but her guiding me with only her finger like I was a child  and she had to tell me more than once thing kind of teed me off a bit, I believe that I have grandchildren older than her and none of them or their parents talk to me in that manner like I am a child. So with that and the beginning of everything else that was the last straw I realized at that point that I was not wanted in that store so I put my items back and went out the door, and told her as I was leaving, the last thing that I wanted to do that day is make a bunch of people nervous and vowed not to ever go back and I have not. I found this really nice pet store and it is even closer and the people there treat me like they really want me to come back, the name of that place is called Mely's< /Text>

The staff here is AMAZING! Theresa, Kristen and Rigo are super awesome with all of my questions, and whenever I take my fur - babies into grooming they are super friendly! Thank you Lynette for awesome service! And Felicia is more than a Dog Trainer, more like the Dog Wisperer!!< /Text>

<text>Nice place.nice ppl. But HATE going pet co.i was here&inly reason i went here-closer)everything always more expensive then pet smart where you have better variety  (looking for 3meat bomes-hadonly one type)as good of a variety.i guess its good for expensive taste...but hey-i hate "Martha Stewart ' & giving her money but even her thing (which i have to say are cute&usually well made) are cheaper at pet smart.< /text>< pics>

<review>Grooming is super friendly.
Took my Pomeranian in, when he got out he had some long hairs that you can tell but not ALOT it was just some places, i cut them when I got home so no big deal, but for $80 I didn't think it was worth it.<//review>< gmapID>

I stood in the aquarium area, didn't get helped.  Asked the cashier to page someone, I stood and waited...same result.  I left. This is common at this store.< /Text>

I like this petco. It's kind of a drive from south fontana, but I enjoy how it's always so crowded with people and their pets.</Text>
