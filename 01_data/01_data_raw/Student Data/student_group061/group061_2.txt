< Review>
This grocery shop is amazing! Everything you need was very easy to find. Affordable prices for all items, groceries, meats, and fresh produce. And also, this place is very conveniently located and the parking area is very spacious. All of the staff as well are always happy and willing to assist you. It was a very good and remarkable experience!< /Review>

< Review>
This grocery shop is very clean, organized, and has an excellent customer service. Here, it was very easy to look at everything I need because it was well-arranged. This place is not crowded and you can do everything you want to do. The staff here is super friendly and helpful. I was always satisfied every time I go here. Highly recommended!< /Review>

<Review>Western Kosher  is very similar to Western Kosher . I got to admit I like their prepared Food a lot more. Their chicken is amazing if you can get because they quickly sell out. Produce is fresh and brought daily.  Gets very busy so best times to go is when everyone is at work.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Never too crowded here. You just have to go at the right times. Really good selection on everything considering it's one of the smaller Safeway's I've been to. Closest Safeway to me and provides me with what I want and need. Legit.</Review>< pictures>

<username>Theresa Contreras</username><text>Claudia (night employee) like to close the doors early.

My dryer stopped working. Arrive at Laundry 360 about 9:45 to dry my laundry. Doors are closed and lady is mopping floor. Tap on windows, lady says "we're closed". I stare you close at 11p.m. Lady then says last wash was at 9:30. I tell her I'm drying not washing. She says "we're still closed"<//text>< response>

The staff are friendly and bilingual--English and Spanish. I would occasionally see the owner (no clue if they were the actual owners or not, but I'd see them fix up the place and work on the machines from time to time when I was small).

I have been coming here since I was in middle school, and they've come a long way in upgrading: there is now a "lounge" where you can sit on orange stools and use your laptop or phone in the back (WiFi is free,  countertops have an outlet above them that supports USBs to charge your phone if you need it), and a support desk in the middle as you walk in.

They offer five different sizes of washers, and a laundry service. Dryers and folding tables are located on both sides, and although some  dryers have better heat, they're responsive to feedback, and will get whatever problem solved if it's within their reach.

The two coin machines are located on the right from the entrance, along with vending machines for laundry supplies and/or snacks.

The restroom is NOT public: you must pay 25c.

Folding tables and machines are constantly wiped down by the staff. Floors also are swept/mopped. There is a sink before the support desk.

Only problem is that parking is sometimes an issue because of the surrounding shops or heavy traffic in the laundromat, but I usually park towards the middle of the lot anyway, if anything.

Personally, I always come back because of the cleanliness + WiFi!<//Text>

Horrible experience, my dryer broke down this evening.  I usually only use this laundromat during those days were I am to busy to wait at home for the next load.  During this visit I was amazed on how poorly I was treated.  I loaded the dryer and the lady that works there told me that the owner does not allow people just to dry.  That I had to remove my clothing and go somewhere else, the worst part about it was that she did it in front of other people and on an evening where 65% of the dryers were available.< /text>

My favorite place to chill and have some comfort food after drinking. The soup tastes the best after you add green onions and salt. The price is really acceptable and the soup and rice just make you feel relaxed and comfortable in stomach. The parking is not easy tho.<//Text>

Went for lunch. Food always excellent,  service fast and friendly personnel. A young man came in and created a disturbance; security was called and showed up almost instantly and took care of the problem by escorting the young man out of the restaurant.  They protected their customers and it was so much appreciated. Recommended.<//Review>

Best almond croissant I've ever had. Perfect balance of airy, crusty and sweet. Shop itself is cozy and quaint with a really nice, non-pretentious neighborhood feel. Can't wait to return and try some of the other croissants and pastries. Everything looks amazing.<//review>

Every pastry here is divine. The matcha and pumpkin croissants are definitely highlights. Taka is the sweetest man, quick, and thoughtful. The espresso here is really quite good. Make sure to come early as he can sell out pretty early on weekends of lots of the pastries.< /Review>

This is the best cafe in downtown LA!
With a wide variety of coffee: strong, smooth, exotic, hot or cold they got it.
And with the half-price coffee in the happy-hour 2pm-5pm from a allready cheap cup, it's a bargain you can't miss!

They also serve an aray of western-hand foods. Like avocado toast, rybread with egg etc.

Approved by a traveling Norwegian!</Text>

It's a great cafe in little Tokyo.  Bulgogi sandwich and Avacado toast are A-Must try on the list. Their drink is also good. I had a brown sugar latte w/ boba, their boba is chewier than other boba shops which I really love it. Clean and relaxing cafe with good wifi connection. Definitely coming back.</text>

The prices are good, especially for this area of downtown, but you get what you pay for. The salads are basic compared to the other offerings in the WaterCourt but aren't bad and it is good to have a reasonable choice for food<//review>

<Date>1479934992122</Date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Delicious Panini Sandwich. There is one entrance. Three ways to go once inside. Left lane most likely for online and phone order pick up. Center lane for regular folks who are wanting to order. Right lane probably to exit once you receive your order.

Seating area available inside as well as outside. Other eateries share outside seating area. Wait time for my order was about five minutes. I did arrive at 12:30pm and a day before Thanksgiving day. Not busy at all.

Sandwich cooked just right. Soup was warm and accompanied with five crouton's. Small chips was a bonus for me. Thank you.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>The prices are good, especially for this area of downtown, but you get what you pay for. The salads are basic compared to the other offerings in the WaterCourt but aren't bad and it is good to have a reasonable choice for food. Extremely limited indoor seating (2 four-tops, 1 six-top, 9 bar seats) and during the lunch hour, the employees on break take up half the seating and then leave their trash for someone (presumably another employee?) to clean up. Plenty of outdoor seating when the weather is nice. Strangely, no trash cans inside. You need to walk outside to throw away your trash...I guess that is why the employees leave their trash in the seating areas.</Text></record>

<review>This little food court gets pretty crowded for lunch and the corner bakery is no exception. It doesn't have an extensive bakery selection but the food is pretty much your typical fare. I came here and got the half carbonara and half tomato soup which are usually my go to. Was great and always recommend if you are looking for some good food.<//review>< Pics>

<text>I especially love this place on the days that they do not run out of the things I crave, i.e. their kouign amanns and their ham and cheese croissants.  The texture, the flavor...salivating as I think of them!  Their chocolate almond croissant is also delicious, but it's the other two that keep me coming back.< /text><Rate>4</Rate>< Gmap_id>

And guess what?? I loved it!! And bought more cookies lol  and a coffee!! Keke gave such amazing customer service! And was so sweet and always with a smile

<review>Yum Yum donuts rocks! Always open and always turning out fresh donuts. There is no shortage of donut shops in Canyon Country. However many close early and many do not restock their offerings during the day. Not so with Yum Yum Donuts. I have never falled to find my favorites day or night!

The store sells more than donuts but I have no experience with their sandwiches or other stuff. I can only attest to their great tasting donuts and a few other pastries I've ordered. Always good!

I might mention that Yum  Yum is a drive for me but the nearly ten mile round trip is well worth it. Staff is always friendly and helpful.

Five stars!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I came here to get a bagel for lunch and right from the beginning the older lady that was taking my order today 3/24 at approximately 12:45 pm was very rude. I asked her a question about the menu and her response was, " I don't know what you want we have what is on the menu" then when I proceeded to ask If I can add items to my order she said that she had already started my order and in a very rude tone asked" what do you want me to do about it" I told her she was being very rude and she tried arguing with me at which point I walked out. Due to this employee I will not be returning to this location. Based on other reviews I see, it seems that she has treated others in a rude manner before which is surprsing that she hasn't been fired yet.<//text>< pictures>

<Date>1598453120605</Date><Rating>2</Rating><review>Being a first time here I had normal expectations of how place would be. When you enter the restaurant looks clean with all the racks full of doughnuts it looks like a nice and welcoming place but thennnnn you get to the staff I was helped by a young Asian women. No greeting given just "what you want" I placed and got some coffee creamer and she basically tossed then at me instead of giving them and after I payed something happened with the return of my CC. With all this social distancing they have a table set up in front of the check to further the distance between you and the staff well this lady kept the food on her side making me stretch over almost to behind the cash register to be able to obtain my food. Overall food is normal as is the coffee the only down side for this place is the staff other than that this would be a great yum Yun location I am surprised this type of customer service is allowed by yum yum you would expect better customer service.<//review>< pics>

< review>
Just went to this location this morning to get a bagel, the “old man” approached me and asked what i wanted so i asked “can i get a regular bagel” (i thought i was pointing at the regular) then he says “that’s not the regular” so then i said “okay just let me get the one that is regular.” After that i noticed he started getting a little attitude towards even though im respectful and watch the way i speak to others. Then he asks “do you want anything else?” (Me thinking he would put cream cheese on it since that’s how you eat a bagel lol...well most people). Anyways i replied with “no that’s it” so he started ringing me up at the register, then i stopped him and said “oh yeah can i get cream cheese on it?” This dude really had the audacity to turn around and tell me “i thought you didn't want anything else?” I was surprised because he looked like he just had a problem with me overall. So i simply responded with “nevermind i don't want it anymore.” (Told him i didnt want it before he put anything on it) He basically started putting on plastic gloves all mad just because i asked for cream cheese on the damn bagel lmao but whatever I hope this little description of this place is helpful to some people in the area. Would give this place zero stars if I could.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The person who took care of me was wearing gloves but with the same gloves that I had, he attended two more people, he was using the register, charging and he did not change the gloves, so he grabbed the donuts, that is lack of hygiene, I did not like it, I think what to take responsibility and more in these times of the virus crown ... in the hands is where more bacteria are now in the money with more reason I hope they take action in the matter because who likes to eat with dirty hands

(Original)
La persona que me atendió traía guantes pero con los mismos guantes que traía atendió a dos personas más estaba usando la registradora cobrando y no se cambió los guantes luego así agarraba las donas eso es falta de higiene eso no me gusto creo qué hay que tomar responsabilidad y más en estos tiempos del corona virus ...en las manos es donde más bacterias hay ahora en el dinero con mayor razón espero tomen cartas en el asunto porque a quien le gusta comer con las manos sucias< /text>

<UserId.>104518367551412498916< /UserId.><review>Hands down - the BEST store with an extensive inventory and knowledge base. We bought all our Medeco locks here years ago.
More recently, I had need to get many duplicate keys made to a very specific Italian made display case for work. No one had the blanks for this. Neither did Hills, but that didn't stop them: they MADE appropriate blanks and then the keys. I was able to use them for an event in one of my accounts.
Then our head mdsr heard I was able to get keys, and she had me make several more to overnight to NY. Hills to the rescue.
Knowledgeable, friendly, and won't gouge you. Unique store, too!
Worth the drive, especially if you have something unique or difficult.</review><Time>1593555552948<//Time><Gmap_id>0x80dd288789080c8b:0x1799ccc510d5235<//Gmap_id><rate>5< /rate><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><name>JillT<//name></record></dataset><record>

Save money by having them re-key the locks. Disassemble lock and they can make a new key when you move into new place instead of buying and installing new lock/new keys. Super friendly. They have been around 75 years. Garden Grove's historical business,<//Review>

<Review>I've been coming to this place on and off for years. This locksmith has one of the best selections as far as locks in Orange county. I've been to many places in Orange county and by far this is one of the best shops.Some locksmiths don't even carry a good selection of paddle locks but they do. I highly suggest spending good money on a good lock. Spend the extra money on a lock that has shackled protection so it's not easily able to cut.</Review><user_name>WESTCOAST RONNIE</user_name><user>116587233833270123910< /user>< GmapID>

A very nice & happy young man helped make a copy of my car key. 2016 Jeep Compass. It only took 10 mins and cost $90. It was a pleasure coming here. Such great service. Happy employees, cool place to work & decent prices. Out back they have parking for 3 cars. With the speed of their service, there should always be a free spot to park in. I recommend this place for all your lock/key needs. These guys will be in business for a long time to come. This is the example for all lock shops. Terrific guys - just terrific. Keep up the good work. Thank goodness we still have stores like this in The OC.<//text>< pictures>

Personilzed service.  These people have got me out of a jam more than once. They think out-of-the-box to solve problems and they aren't looking for the most expensive solution either. And the prices are reasonable. Good old-fashioned type of service and attitude.</Text>

Came in and within minutes they got to it and was out of there in no time with two new copies to the snug top of my truck. The staff is definitely very knowledgeable at their craft. Definitely would recommend them to anyone with any key issues or copy needs.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I had a telehealth visit with the Doctor a few months back. I was telling him what I was looking for. I was mainly looking for things I could do or consume that could possibly help me fight my hair loss. He helped me so much by sending me a list of things that I could do to try and same my hair and also some things that could be causing my hair loss.

I found out I was consuming a couple things that could be causing hair loss. So I immediately stopped using them. I also started using the products which he suggested for hair growth. Now it's too soon to really know how this is going to turn out, but I am hoping for the best.

He seemed like such a nice Doctor and was more than willing to try and help me.</Review>

Dr. Sean is an amazing artist in the hair reimagined community. His eye for detail and insight on proper hair placement all while walking a fine line of cautious yet progressive outcome is outstanding. His gentle yet jovial personality immediately softens every worry or concern. He has a deep knowledge of his craft and enjoys sharing his love and passion with you at all times. On a side note, post surgery, Dr. Sean has scored above and beyond marks with continued communication, information, procedure updates and that personal touch that so many people seem to lack. Top 25 hair transplant surgeons in America. I can see why. Thank you Dr. Sean. I'm already planning my next procedure with you.

<Date>1626847967774< /Date><rate>5< /rate><Review>It has been eight and a half years now since Dr. Sean performed my hair restoration surgery. My hair graphs are still thriving! I am so grateful for the inner security I feel in my appearance, which I have enjoyed throughout these years. At age 49, I am getting complimented on the thickness of my hair by my hairstylists. I would not have believed this 10 years ago. It still seems like a very sweet dream, but it is my reality.

I would also like to say just how kind and caring Dr. Sean is. I had a follow up visit today. I am always touched by his welcome and warmth. He is such a sweet and gentle person. This means so much, especially eight and a half years ago when I felt so sensitive and shy to discuss my hair concerns. Dr. Sean, just being who he is, made me feel comfortable. It is always easy and enjoyable talking to him. I hope this helps anyone else who  feels like I did. You are in great care with Dr. Sean!

Oh, let me also add how impressed I was today with Dr. Sean's new beautiful office spaces. They are so well ventilated and fresh with state of the art air filtration systems. Dr. Sean explained to me that he invested heavily in his air purification system in an abundance of caution to keep his staff and patients safe from Covid.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Dr. Sean, is hands down, the best! He has an amazing bedside manner, made me feel super comfortable and relaxed. My overall experience with my eyebrow transplant procedure was absolutely amazing and turned out so beautiful! It is life-changing! I feel so confident and pretty! The only thing I regret is waiting so long to do the actual procedure. Don’t waste any time, if you’re feeling you want a hair transplant whether it be on your scalp or eyebrows, at least go see him for a consult… He is amazing and very personable. Thank you Dr. Sean! And your whole team! I am a very super happy, satisfied client!<//review>< pics>

<text>I had a great experience at Dr. Sean's office. I was stuck with a hair transplant scar that had widened severely after three strip removal procedures. It was a very tricky, difficult problem to fix but Dr. Sean used his skill and expertise to revise the scar and make it far less noticeable. I would highly recommend him to anyone considering any kind of hair transplant or revision from past procedures.< /text><Time>1625265585495< /Time><rate>5< /rate>< response>

<rate>5<//rate><response>None</response><Review>Let me start off by saying that I could not be happier with my results and with Dr Sean. He is truly a magician and made me feel so comfortable. My hairline is finally back!

I came in for my consultation after countless hours of internet/Yelp/reddit forums...you name it. I chose to reach out to Dr Sean after seeing his name pop up in a good way everywhere. But the biggest reason was because he specializes in African American hair. Other places would only mention it on the website but not very much. Dr Sean has a whole section dedicated to African American hair. He even has a special tool he uses for kinky hair types. After my consultation I knew I wanted Dr Sean to do my surgery, mostly because I never felt rushed or pressured into it. Dr Sean and his hair consultant clearly laid out the procedure, pricing(very fair prices), healing timeline and dates available if I chose to book that day. When you do work as well as he does, you don't need the hard sell.

From the consultation, to the surgery and even afterwards, his attention and service has been great. I get texts from Dr Sean asking how my healing is going. He really cares about the work he does and really cares about his patients. He doesn't just leave you out to dry once you have the surgery. He makes himself available all the  time for questions. To sum it up...

Surgery day-10/10.
Recovery-10/10
Service-10/10
Follow ups 10/10

Go to Dr Sean, at least a consultation. If you're on the fence, meeting him in person will definitely push you to his side, he's so funny and nice.< /Review>< gmapID>

I rarely share anything publicly unless what I receive is something extremely good or extremely bad. I had a fantastic experience with Dr. Sean's talented group, and would do it again. As a matter of fact, I already know I will do it again. Just one more time, though. My hair is going to look great now, and round number two down the line will make it even better. I keep telling folks I know that when they are ready for a bit more hair on top, they know a guy who knows THE GUY. THE GUY is Dr. Benham.<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Dr. Sean is one of the best practioners I've interacted with. He is patient, supportive and goes above and beyond to support his patients. From consultation, to procedue and subsequent follow ups, which in my case lasted for over a year, he was easy to contact and was always caring. He sets realistic expectations and does not recommend anything more than what is required.

I would highly recommend him and will not think twice to take his guidance/services in the future. With Dr. Sean, you are building a relation with a trusted partner who really cares about you.

Thank you Dr. Sean. You are truly a gem!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Dr. Benham is good at what he does. He clearly has a lot of passion for his work. He did a fantastic job and I'll be sure to use his services again in the future. You can tell he's very knowledgeable in this field because he goes over all the nuances of the surgery in great detail.

I preferred to deal with him directly versus with his business guy since I'm an engineer I can see the same kind of engineer-like spark in his eyes.

The process was relatively pain free except for the part where he numbs you. It took half a day to complete. He gives you his personal number to text him anytime you have a question or any issue. Very good customer service direct from the man.

Highly recommend going to him to help fight off that aging process.< /Review><user_id>116380107122463733309< /user_id><GmapID>0x80c2bb468a73dabb:0x3db7fe123f83b097< /GmapID>< Rate>

From the day I came in for a consultation to the day of the procedure itself, Dr. Sean was attentive and kind and knowledgable. His staff and assistants were just as informed, friendly, and responsive.

I’d done so much research, but Dr. Sean’s passion for hair and hair restoration assured me I didn’t need to look any further. As a black woman who has been getting tight braids and weaves for years without regard to the damage, I realized I’d eroded my hairline at such a young age, and that traction damage was no longer naturally reversible. Dr. Sean specializes in working with course or curly hair, and the hairlines he creates are always natural.

The day of the procedure was really enjoyable. He and his staff are are diligent and a delight to be around. You’re awake the entire time, they always make sure you’re comfortable and experiencing zero pain. Afterwards you’re sent home with literally everything you need for successful healing and the dr provides his personal number which he responds to via call, FaceTime, or text whenever his patients need him.

His work speaks for itself and I’m so grateful I found him. I’ll update my post in 6 months as my hair continues to grow back, but please check out his previous work to see for yourself. You will not regret choosing f Dr. Sean Behnam!</review>

<review>Such an amazing experience! Thank you so much for your care and excellent work with my hair transplant!

For anyone considering this procedure, keep in mind you have to do it during a period when your hair follicles are young / robust enough to actually be pulled from one area on your scalp to another. Meaning if you wait too long to get it done, you might not be a candidate anymore.

I know it's a lot of money for a young person just starting to earn a living to commit to, but you won't regret it.</review>< time>

I would absolutely recommend Dr. Sean to anyone seeking a hair transplant expert. An exceptional hair transplant requires the work of both a medical professional and an artist, and Dr. Sean is both. I did a LOT of research, had multiple consultations with different doctors (from San Diego to LA), and looked into each doctor’s level of experience before choosing Dr. Sean for my long-awaited procedure. I live in San Diego, but Dr. Sean became my number one choice, and I couldn’t be happier.

Since this was my very first cosmetic surgery, I was pretty nervous, but Dr. Sean made the day of my surgery so pleasant. He made sure I was comfortable and well-fed; and his staff work together so well. It has been one week since my FUT surgery with Dr. Sean, and he has been nothing short of responsive and caring before, during, and after.

On a Saturday evening two days after my surgery, I had an accident at home where one of my grafts fell out. I texted Dr. Sean immediately, and he responded within 5 minutes. He met me at his office that night at 8:30pm to fix my graft. Talk about amazing patient care!!</Review>

<text>Dr. Sean is the best!
I did some extensive research (with visits to different doctors in Los Angeles and reading zillions of reviews and articles about hair restoration) before deciding to go with him. At first, I thought he was just too good to be true. How could someone be so nice, so caring?? Well, it's been years now since my first visit to him, and I can tell you, he's truly a wonderful person, as well as a master of his craft. I have done both the FUT and FUE procedures with him (I did the FUE last week), and I could not be happier with the results. Trust him. He and his dedicated team will give you the care I am sure you cannot find anywhere else.< /text>< GmapID>

Dr. Sean Behnam was very professional and friendly. He was up front about the possibility of the grafts possibly not taking due to the severity of scaring I had experienced because of acid damage to my scalp. I was fortunate that the grafts took and the hair restoration was successful for the area that was treated. I look forward to future treatments in other areas where my hair line and eyebrow was destroyed. His staff was pleasant to work with and follow up calls were abundant in ensuring that recovery was going well. I chose not to go back into the office for regular checks after the first month as I felt healing was going well enough in my opinion and it was a long trip. Dr. Behnam was amiable to face time consults in effort to save me the travel to his office. This was helpful by reducing stress that would otherwise have been experienced during long drives. So far results are excellent, and I am very happy with the hair restoration.<//Review>

He provides explanations and resources necessary in order to make informed decisions about your procedure. I have had a few hair procedures with other Doctors, and none of them ever spent  nearly as much time as Dr. Sean did with me. He truly cares and his staff are very proficient. I am extremely satisfied with the overall experience.</Review>< UserId.>

I preface this review by saying I’m not the type of person to take the time to give a lengthy review, positive or negative, unless it’s well deserved and warranted.

Before meeting Dr.Benham, I had two FUE procedures done with another reputable doctor; the front and the mid scalp. I wasn’t unhappy with the results, but I wasn’t ecstatic about them either. After thorough online research into what doctor to use for the procedure, I went to Dr Benham to address my crown area. From the first consultation, Dr. Benham was amazing. He went over a detailed plan with me, and was straight up with me in terms of expected results. Since I had two FUE procedures done prior to meeting with Dr Benham, he was honest in saying that we may not have an abundant amount of donor hair to fill the crown, but we will make a significant improvement on it nonetheless.

The day of the procedure was a breeze. Pain is minimal, and Dr. Benham and his friendly staff give you the utmost dedication and attention in the fact that the doctor only does one procedure a day. Dr Benham was able to extract just under 2000 grafts. During the procedure Dr Benham explained what was going on, how it was going and even shot a short video for me on my phone of some grafts being placed. Couldn’t have been happier with the procedure that day.

One difference that really stuck out in my mind, was the attention that Dr. Benham showed in regards to my immediate post-op care. My previous doctor, although reputable, didn’t give me any attention in terms of post-op care. Dr. Benham did the exact opposite. He gave me his personal cell number, along with some tips on eating a hair healthy diet and a vitamin regimen to obtain optimum results.

Flash forward 6 months, and to say I’m happy is an understatement. My crown looks like a head full of hair and it’s still got some thickening coming up in the next six months or so. Dr Benham’s technique is the reason I was able to get such amazing results with a limited amount of donor hair. If only I had him do my prior procedures for the front and mid scalp.

Since the day of my surgery to this day, Dr Benham has helped me along in my journey. His hair growth topical formula is amazing as well. He instructed me to start using it on my crown area as well as my front area where I had a previous FUE treatment. He said we’d look at the front after a few months of the topical treatment and see if we should try for another FUE procedure to fill some areas. Turns out that’s not necessary. The topical treatment has thickened my front and mid scalp to the point where Dr Benham said it’s not necessary to have another FUE treatment right now. Like I said at the beginning of my review, if you’re looking for a doctor to get a hair transplant done, stop looking. Dr Benham is hands down the best in the business.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< Time>

After conducting my own due diligence and interviewing many hair transplant specialists over a two year period, I decided on an FUE procedure with Dr. Sean Behnam. He and his team immediately put me at ease. They are very professional and do their jobs well. The procedure was less painful and stressful than I imagined. I followed all the post op advice and had no complications at all. My hair started growing back after 6-7 weeks. It’s now been 9 months and I feel it almost fully grown out. I am overjoyed at the results. Thank you Dr. Behnam. C.B.</Text>

I was losing my hair at a young age of 26. I didn’t know what to do to fix it. I desperately wanted a fix, so I decided to have my first hair transplant with a very known company, it was a total disappointment. I’m not going to get into detail because this review is not about my past negative experience with another doctor.
15 years later after my first hair transplant, I gave it another try. This time around I did my diligent research and met with a few doctors, none of them felt right nor genuine. I came upon Dr. Sean practice online and watch a few of his YouTube videos. I was amazed with all the positive reviews I found all over the web and the informative videos he posts. I made a call and a few days later had my consultation. My initial consultation went extremely great, Dr Sean went over everything in detail with such a passion that make you feel that you are at the right place. Just to mention a few things, he went over how he will place the hair and the direction it will be, the tools that he uses to produce a perfection extraction with minimal scar. My whole hair transplant procedure went so smooth, Dr Sean and his staff were so humble and professional, they worked tirelessly to accommodate me and make sure I was taking care of. I had no pain during or afterwards and my healing went great with no scars. Dr Sean is one of a kind, nothing but perfection and attention to detail. Two years later with my hair transplant with Dr. Sean, you will never think or know that I had a hair transplant. I’m very satisfied with my experience and results. I highly recommend Dr. Sean.</review>< rating>

Dr. Sean Benham is an absolute Artist in his field

I was losing my hair and had resigned to the fact that I was going bald and abandoning the prospect of a full head of hair.

I thought I would at least investigate the Idea of trying to salvage my Hair.

My hair was getting quite thin and my feeling to find a Physician that even understood the complexities for my ethnic hair was unlikely.

Never the less, I searched nationwide for a Physician that I thought would give me the highest possibility of a positive outcome although I would have been content with a modest improvement or stabilization of my hair.

I found Dr. Sean Benham and he is absolutely a leader in the field, his team is knowledgeable, investigative and he is really a gifted Hair transplant artist.( I Know it sounds over the top but no; The guy is really, really sharp; an Artist in his field of FUE is quite appropriate). I believe his work with ethnic hair is unique and most likely developed with his own experience and research.

I am an experienced 30 year in field healthcare provider and Practice in a Hospital teaching setting. I can differentiate good from bad healthcare and Dr. Sean Bonham and his team are the very top shelf. Everything was meticulously communicated, detailed and planned, he does not cut corners.

Dr. Sean(as everyone calls him)  provides his personal cell phone and his availability and responsiveness is exceptional.

Before and During the procedure Dr. Sean’s instructions were very clear and easy to follow. The procedure took one day…in at 6am out by 2:30

My outcome…was amazing .

Most likely I had a really positive outcome was because Dr. Sean is exceptionally talented and  provided clear instructions along his own youtube channels, great communication, and everything was easy to follow. Everything was provided by the office therefore there was no running around searching for products, prescriptions, bandages,  It was just a really good experience.

I would give Dr. Sean Benham and his team in Santa Monica five stars, his efforts have actually improved my quality of life.    Money well spent.</Text>

<review>Dr. Sean Behnam is one of a kind - he's professional, kind, compassionate and elite at what he does. He is at the top of his game and nobody compares to his skills and artistry. I can assure you that if you choose to have your hair restoration procedure done by Dr. Sean you will feel comfortable and confident throughout the process knowing that you will achieve the best possible outcome through his work. I went for multiple consultations with other groups but not one other physician was as honest and straight forward as Dr. Sean and nobody else really made me feel comfortable about taking the leap and actually getting it done. His staff and his personal advisor, Steve, are also excellent and worked tirelessly to accommodate me and make sure everything went smoothly. Thank you all so much! I just had my procedure done 2 weeks ago and the process has been seamless. He really worked with me to make sure what he did was exactly what I wanted. The day of the procedure was a breeze. I had no pain during or afterwards and my healing has been excellent so far. See photos of his amazing work! He has even texted me every single day to check on me. You can't ask for more! Can't wait for it to grow out.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>The whole process was absolutely amazing. Dr. Sean provided all the materials I needed to understand exactly what was going on at all times. Very professional and sweet. Gave me personal cell phone number and stays in communication to this day.

The best part though is that it 100% worked. My hairline was receding in the front. Dr Sean put in 1,000 grafts and literally within 4 months my entire hairline was perfect. After 1 year, it was thick like I never lost my hair in the first place.

Thank you so much Dr. Sean.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

After having a consultation with another 2 hair specialists, I found Dr Behnam. He is knowledgeable, and supervises everything personally.

The pre-surgical instructions and the post surgical care was very well explained, and in addition to this Dr Behnam was very easy to reach throughout this time for any specific questions that I encountered.

I wouldn’t recommend anyone else.<//text>

I wish I could give more than a 5-star rating as my experience with Dr. Sean has been really great! Dr. Sean is one of the kindest men I have ever met, and that made it easy for me to select him as my doctor. Right from the consultation session, I knew I was in safe and excellent hands. Dr. Sean and his team were very professional and well equipped during the procedure, and they made me feel so safe and comfortable. I was really happy afterwards and I had no doubts that I had made the right decision to go in for the procedure. I've had my 1 year post-op visit, and my hair has grown back so well! Thank you Dr. Sean for being the kind, humble and amazing doctor that you are!!!<//review>

The consultation was easy and straightforward and Dr. Sean answered all of my questions patiently and thoroughly. The day of the procedure was incredibly smooth. I was the only patient that Dr. Sean so that day, so I felt looked after and cared for the entire time. It's only been a few days, but Dr. Sean has been following up with me daily and helping me  through the healing and recovery process.

I'm looking forward to seeing the results!

Update: It's been one year since the surgery and I could not be happier with the results. My hair looks great and it feels great to look in the mirror and see the results each day. My wife and I still talk about how great Dr. Sean was and how helpful he was throughout the whole process. As someone that spends a lot of time and energy taking care of my health and fitness, it's extra inspiration to see my greatly improved hairline in the mirror each day. Thanks Dr. Sean and crew!!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Dr. Sean and his team were excellent! After meeting with several hair transplant doctors in LA I chose Dr. Sean based on several factors: 1) he in no way felt like a salesman 2) from the beginning took time to talk with me about what I wanted, what were realistic expectations, and if I was even a good candidate 3) was extremely friendly 4) was always available after the procedure to follow up with any questions I might have.

During the procedure itself he made sure I was very comfortable, and even got me lunch. Since I was traveling from far away he split the cost of a hotel room with me to make the day after significantly more comfortable.

I've been very happy with the results. Before I was nervous to go outside on a windy day without a cap for fear of exposing the very thin hair on the front of my scalp. Now, I don't think anything of it! The hair looks significantly thicker, feels thicker, and most importantly, makes me feel way better about myself. Plus, no one has ever suspected that I've had a hair transplant.

You can trust that Dr. Sean will not simply try to sell you a hair transplant, but take the time to make sure you're a good candidate for the process. Even then he will be cautious to make sure you understand what you can expect from the results. I was personally shocked by how much better the results turned out.< /Review>< gmapID>

<Review>I feel so lucky to have found such a great hair transplant surgeon. As a dermatologist, not only I happily refer patients to Dr Behnam, but I have also referred my own family there.  Every single patient I know who has been treated by Dr Sean Behnam has been very happy with the results and grateful for the recommendations. Keep up the great work!</Review>< Gmap_id>

For the last 10+ years, my hairline has receded and thinned to the point where I wanted to have a hair transplant. Like most clients, I combed the internet for information and reviews. After watching one of Dr. Sean’s YouTube videos, and meeting him during the initial consultation, I was persuaded by his patience and kindness for the way he explained the procedure. He provides a human touch and truly cares for your well-being and your hair transplant outcome. For me, the only painful part of the procedure was the numbing. But don’t let that dissuade you. Dr. Sean is there for you every step of the way—before, during, and after the procedure. Six months later, I am happy with my outcome. Other tips: be patient, don’t panic, listen to his advice, follow all instructions, and contact him for lingering questions. Finally: Enjoy the results!<//text>

I'm about 9 months removed from my surgery and loving every second of it. I wake up every morning and am super stoked to look at myself in the mirror, Its really amazing.

If you're like me and were wondering if the whole hair transplant thing was worth it, trust me, its every bit as amazing as you could hope. Tons of people are getting it done these days like famous athletes and actors you see every day. DO IT!!!

Update: Just got Surgery #2! Dr. Behnam and his staff were extremely caring, attentive and calming.  The process was a breeze and I'm super excited to see how the crown of my head turns out. The photo attached to this review is after Surgery #1, I'll update in 6 months!</text>

< Review>
This is my second FUE procedure.  I didn’t do my first FUE with Dr Behnam.
There are several differences between the two experiences.
Dr. Behnam does the entire procedure himself.  He discusses with me where to prioritize to have hair transplanted to maximize the fullness look since I have limit amount of donors.  He draws on my scalp and shows me pictures of it.  My first procedure was done by two technicians.
After the surgery Dr. Behnam gives me a spray and an Acell cream to reduce the chance of scab formation and to cut down the healing time for the donor area.  It might help regrow some of the donors back.  I wish I had that in my first operation.
Dr. Behnam texts me that night and he even wakes up before 6 am to reply my text.  It is impressive.
I drive from San Diego to do my surgery with Dr Behnam.  It so worths the driving and the traffic.  Thank you Dr Behnam<//Review>

<text>Dr. Sean is awesome!  You can trust that he will take care of you and leave you with great results because he cares. I’ve had the strip procedure (FUT) done twice with great results and minimal scarring. I recommend the stem cell as it helps with healing where the incision was made.  Dr. Sean and his team are accommodating, friendly and they are there to help you for whatever it is that you need.  Clear instructions were given before, during and after the procedure.  Dr. Sean and his team made sure I was comfortable and felt no pain during the procedure and because of this positive experience it was easy for me to get a second procedure done.  Dr. Sean followed up the following day and gave his personal number for any questions and checked up on me frequently.   You can’t get a Dr. better than him and for this reason I’m sure I am not the only one to drive a long distance to see him.  Thank you Dr. Sean for being such a great person and making my hair look good again! :)<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Dr. Sean and his team were incredible to work with and extremely professional. He gave me an honest recommendation for my situation/hair type and didn't try to sell me more than I needed. As other reviewers have stated, Dr. Sean gave me his personal cell number and was always available to answer questions and check on my recovery. Highly recommended!</Text>

It was a two day procedure and the entire time Dr. Sean and his entire staff were great, he kept me well informed and made sure I was comfortable even though sometimes it slowed the procedure.  After the surgery he is very accessible for any questions or concerns.  If I was not following up with him, he was reaching out to me, to see how I was doing and asking for pictures on my progress.  After seeing the results and how well I was healing, I decided to have a second FUE procedure six months ago.  My friends and family who I have told about it, cannot believe the difference it has made and how natural it looks.  The ones who I have not told just comment, “wow, you grew out your hair, it looks great!” I just had a six month follow up for the second procedure, with Dr. Sean. He was just as excited and proud of the results as I was. You can genuinely tell he cares about his patients and the results they are getting.  I will recommend Dr. Sean to anyone considering hair transplant surgery.<//text>< Pics>

My experience with Dr Sean was nothing but positive, and 100% successful results.  I didn’t really consider hair transplant a real option, until seeing Dr Sean’s work.  After my consolation with him, I felt very comfortable and confident to go through with it.

It’s been a year since my first procedure, and I just had a second one.  My hair looks very natural and grows organically, and looks so good.  Dr Sean spends a lot of time with you to make sure that the shape and coverage of the new hair looks very natural and frames your face.  This is the first time I’ve grown my hair in out in probably 15 years.  It’s incredible that this technology exists.

The staff there is very attentive and professional.  The day of the procedure, they order you lunch and take great care of you.  Dr Sean has personally been in contact with me through the whole process to monitor my recovery, process, and well-being.  I’ve done a lot of research into hair procedures, and I would only recommend Dr Sean to anyone interested in getting hair again.</Text>

I'm amazed at my before-and-after pictures.  I knew my hair was thinning, but I didn't realize how much had actually grown back over the last six months.

I realize each person's hair restoration is different, so rather than use my personal results as any sort of benchmark, let me simply observe that Dr. Sean and his entire staff are terrific -- and well worth a visit so you can see for yourself!<//Text>

My experience with Dr Sean was incredibly positive. He was very diligent and transparent about his procedures and anticipated results and he followed up continuously after the procedure. I am now 1 year post surgery and feel great, the results are amazing. I definitely recommend Dr Sean and thank him for his great work and level of professionalism throughout.</Text>

<text>Dr. Sean did an excellent job with my hair transplant. I was starting to bald on the top and in the front a year ago and now my hair has grown back to the point that I feel confident not wearing a hat anymore. Everyone from Dr. Sean to the staff were always helpful and super nice from the day of the operation to the many follow-ups that came after. I don’t regret choosing Dr. Sean for my hair transplant and would totally recommend anyone else on the fence to give him a shot.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>I want to start by saying that I have never had any type of surgical procedure done before so I was very apprehensive about hair transplants and I really wanted to make sure to do my research before deciding to go through with my procedure. I had met with a few different doctors in my area but ultimately, I felt that Dr. Sean Behnam was the best choice for me. He seemed to really care about my concerns and questions and took time to answer them all. The procedure went very smoothly and Dr. Sean and his team were nothing but friendly and professional. It really was a smooth and painless process and I can't think Dr. Sean and his team enough for that. I'm about 4 days in to my post-op and Dr. Sean has checked in on me every day to make sure everything is going well and that I'm healing properly. This has been a great experience and if I ever need to go back for a future procedure I will definitely be going back to Dr. Sean!</Text>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Here’s why I chose to go with Dr. Sean Behnam for an FUE hair transplant after first visiting two other hair transplant clinics:

1.    He’s super knowledgeable and has years of experience in hair transplant procedures
2.    He was thorough and friendly during our consultation and shared his honest opinion
3.    His work looks very natural and the results speak for themselves

Bottom line: Hair transplant, weather FUE or FUT, is not magic. You won’t get the same hair you had when you were 12 years old (nor should you because that wouldn’t look natural) but the results will eventually look much better than pre-op. The procedure itself is not a difficult experience to go through and Dr. Behnam's staff does a great job in making the process go by smooth. When it comes to hair transplants, choosing the right doctor with an extensive background in the field is crucial. This procedure requires an artistic eye and exceptional technical skill which Dr. Behnam certainly has. Overall, I am very pleased with the results and my decision to go with Dr. Behnam.<//text>< Pics>

I came to Dr. Sean after a friend referred me and told me how great his experience was. I had the same experience. Very friendly staff and took great care of me. I had 2000 grafts in one day and the pain was so minimal. Only when I was numbed it stung for a few seconds. Steve is a great guy also. Very humble and explained the entire process to me. Everyone has complimented me since I got the procedure done and has asked me who I saw and I have recommended them all to Dr. Sean. He is the Leonardo Di Vinci of hair art. Great job and thank you again! So happy!< /review>

<Review>Dr. Sean is very nice, professional, and always available for questions whenever you have them. (His series of videos really prepared me for what to expect pre and post-op.) His work is VERY good and all of the pricing is transparent and up-front. The day of my procedure went by very smoothly, less painful than the dentist, and actually very pleasant while talking with the staff and watching movies while they worked. If I need another procedure later on, I'll definitely be coming back.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I am a patient of Dr. Sean Behnam,  I am writing this review because I wanted to let women know especially African American, there is help for our thinning and balding scalp.  Dr. Sean and staff are very professional, I felt at ease with them, especially with having such an embarrassing situation. I've gone to several doctors who had know clue what to do with African American hair, I have kinky curly hair, which I was losing drastically. I had a consultation with  Dr. Sean,  I felt confident that he was the doctor for me and my problem. Surgery was scheduled for me for implants, my own growing hair, and now I am over the moon with the results, my own thick growing hair. I wished I had known about Dr.Sean Behnam years ago. Dr. Sean has given me confidence for a brighter future with my own growing hair. I would highly recommend Dr. Sean Behnam.</text>

I had an outstanding experience with Dr. Sean and his team.  Hair loss is not something I wanted to deal with, but when it began to happen, I decided have something done about.  Dr. Sean and his team only perform one procedure per day, giving them time to work with the natural orientation of the hair, restoring the scalp to its pre-hair loss appearance.  They did such a great job that I rarely think about my hair thinning in the first place.  I am extremely pleased with the outcome, and highly recommend them.< /Text>

I’m extremely happy with my results, again highly recommended him. Thank you so much Dr. Sean</review>

I had an amazing experience with Dr. Sean and staff! The attention and focus he gives to the process is incredibly personal and professional. I could not be happier with how my procedure went, and I am grateful for the continuing support and care everyone at the office continues to show! Will be recommending to anyone I know who is interested in a hair transplant operation. Thank you Dr. Sean and team!< /Text>

After several consults with what seemed to be nothing better than used car salesmen in the LA area, I was so happy to find Dr. Sean and knew from dermatology work with his brother in same office they have an incredible reputation in Santa Monica. His approach, and evaluation was always personal and realistic, with competitive pricing. I had ~2500 FUE about 1.5 years ago and couldn't be happier with the results which look entirely natural. What made the experience easy and comfortable was his attention to detail and explaining each step as he went, along with a staff that is amazing working with him. I was kept comfortable during the procedure and with adequate breaks, movies, food it really was well done. Thanks again Dr. Sean and I can highly highly recommend him to anyone!!</Review>

If you are concerned about hair loss, don’t look anymore.  Just see Dr. Sean Behnam.  With Dr. Behnam, you are in excellent care! He and his staff are super friendly and helpful.  He answered all my questions, made me feel comfortable, and really took care of me through the whole procedure and after.  He is patient, knowledgeable, dedicated and very passionate about hair restoration, so you are in good hands.  Dr. Behnam was available whenever I needed.  I’m really happy with my results.  Everything looks completely natural.  It boosted my confidence.  I have no doubt you will be very happy with Dr. Behnam.< /review>

<review>It's been 15 months since I had my crown transplant surgery with
Dr. Sean and I couldn't be happier with the results. The scarring from the donor strip removal was excellently minimized by his technique and I'm able to wear my hair as short as #2 without any visible scarring, Dr. Sean has a very down to earth personality and I consider him a friend as well, I was given his cell number early on which really made me feel good to know I could contact him directly if needed. The results are very natural and I would recommend him to anyone considering a hair transplant, you will not be disappointed.</review>< Rating>

The hair transplant was successful and I feel I’ve chosen the right clinic. If I have to do it again in the future, I will definitely ask Dr. Sean to do it again. So amazing.</Review>

<Text>First class all the way. Really really cares about his patients and the results. Great bedside manner makes the process very easy.

In all my life, that’s 45 years, I’ve never met a Doctor Who cares about his patients as much as Dr. Sean. Every time I’ve needed him he’s been there for me and he just has a genuine heart and passion for what he does. I would absolutely 150% recommend him to anybody that wanted this procedure< /Text>< response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Dr Sean is the Man!  I had the FUE procedure done with him a little over a year ago and I'm super happy with the results.  Dr. Sean rebuilt my hairline in a natural appearing way, and probably doubled the volume of hair in the middle-front and top.  Dr. Sean was a pleasure to deal with from my first consultation with him.  My recovery from the FUE was super fast - I went to work two days after the procedure wearing a big trucker hat:-).  Highly recommend!< /review>< pictures>

Just had a procedure done today and will wait on the results which I'm positive will be great and I have to say was very impressed. Friendly staff and did not make it awkward for me. It was a family type atmosphere and explained everything very thoroughly and procedure was painless and didn't take long. I highly recommend to whoever else that are thinking of coming here and having a procedure done. Will wait on the results and post more reviews after. It was a very wonderful experience.<//review>

I made an appointment for a free consultation, and during that time his team walked me through the procedure (I ended up being a candidate for FUE) and provided insight into what to expect.  Then, Dr. Sean met with me and did a more through analysis of my hair.  I have to say that Dr. Sean is the most down-to-earth and kind doctor I have ever met.  He did not talk down to me like other doctors I have spoken with, but rather made me feel comfortable in answering all my questions and giving his input into what options would be right for me.

During the day of the transplant, Dr. Sean and his team made me feel at ease and talked me through every step of what they were doing.  After the hair transplant, Dr. Sean met with me again to walk me through the post-op process - detailing exactly what maintenance I needed to do to ensure healing and long-term success.  Dr. Sean even reached out to check up on me numerous times after the transplant was complete; I cannot emphasize how reassuring it has felt to know that I am in constant touch with Dr. Sean, and can update him on my progress or ask any questions that come up.  It's only been a few weeks out since my hair transplant, and the recovery has been going well.  I strongly recommend Dr. Sean and his team for anyone considering a hair transplant.  There is no one better in the hair transplant business than him, and I cannot wait to see the results of everything in a few months.

UPDATE (10 Months After)
It's been almost a year since the FUE Procedure and I am over the moon with the results.  Looking back at old photos, it's amazing to see how much hair has regrown and filled in.  Dr. Sean has been wonderful with keeping in touch with me and answering my questions throughout the recovery process.  If anyone is even thinking about or considering having a hair transplant in the future, I recommend reaching out to Dr. Sean for a consultation.  Can't say enough wonderful things about him, and I only wish that others have great results with their hair as I did.< /text></record>

To be honest I had had a bad experience with the first hair implant that I had from ANOTHER Dr..NOT Dr. Sean. This other Dr did not only do a bad  job, he did not follow up and the scar left was painful and extremely noticeable. I was blessed and thankful when I found Dr. Sean Benham. He took the time and was kind, attentive, personable and most of all  knowledgable in his field. HE CARES ABOUT HIS PATIENTS! He recommended that I remove the scare tissue that was there from my botched surgery before having another surgery. This scar made me so self conscience besides the fact it was very numb and painful it looked bad. My experience was so much different that the other Dr. ( in a positive light!)  that not only would I go back to Dr. Sean  and have expressed my gratitude, but have recommended several friends to look no further if they want to have a hair transplant! !< /review>

After realizing I was diagnosed with alopecia, I thought my life was over. My beautiful head of hair was no more. I was depressed and didn’t want to be in public. Dr. B bought me out of my depression. He gave me hope. This procedure works!
When I saw the first new hairs sprouting, I cried. My hair is coming back and it’s only been 6 months!</text>

Who would’ve thought I’d be getting a hair transplant and how did I end up with Dr Sean with the hundreds of other options in LA?

I started noticing him through his replies on forums just from basic google searches. Does it hurt, realistic goals, cost involved, fue vs fut, etc.

Then I read a few articles about him and decided to go in for a consult.

I didn’t meet with his partner/hype man Steve(I think that’s his name... sorry if it’s not Steve) I met with Dr Sean. We talked about options, expectations and the procedure.

Of course the hair line I wanted wasn’t what he was going to be able to accomplish on the first try... but he’s really honest from the beginning. “If you want thickness and a natural look for your age this is what I’m going to do.” I liked that and I knew he was the guy. (Once you meet him you’ll know too)

$500 deposit later and I was scheduled for my day about 2 months later (he performs 1 per day and is pretty booked).

I went with the cheaper fut, he thought the fue method was not necessary for me. I will probably do the fue next time as healing is wayyyy easier.

Okay day of surgery. It’s an early start and the team is there and ready. They made it as accommodating and comfortable as they could for me. It’s painless except for the local he gives you where the cut is made on the back of your head. To me that was painful. Like it hurt. (But maybe I’m soft lol but once that starts working it’s painless the rest of the day)

I drove home that day. I was tired and stressed but I drove 15 miles home.

Post:
He gives you his cell phone! He wants you to text him and call him. And well I did.

I had a few issues in the post procedure. Nothing to do with his procedure or instructions though I will say is the first day or two when you have to keep the area wet with a solution he gives you he wants you to irrigate it with some pressure not just keep it wet. That’s where I went wrong.

The cut in the back of the head is a little painful after and the healing process in general is gross and stressful but that’s just the procedure wherever you go. Don’t expect to look kind of presentable for atleast a month or two.

Regardless I made it though. Almost a year later and I’m a new man. Is it like Brad Pitt’s hair? Not exactly but it’s damn close!

Him and his team are great and I highly suggest you go with them on your hair transplant as it’s an art form too and Dr Sean created the paint brush.</Review>

Dr. Sean and his staff are super friendly and look after your every need. I researched many hair transplant doctors and have been happy that I've found one that is dedicated to his craft and takes great pride in his work. He only does 1 hair transplant a day so his staff can offer the best results possible without cutting any corners. I do have to say I'm very pleased with the results and would recommend Dr. Sean if you're considering having a hair transplant. He explains the procedure well and gives you plenty of follow-up information on what to do after your procedure.< /review>

< Review>
Dr. Benham is a superb surgeon. 10/10. I researched hair transplant surgeons for nearly two years and identified Dr. Benham as the ideal doctor for my fut procedure. Dr. Benham provided me clear insight and options for my transplant. Another LA doctor discouraged me from an fut procedure. Dr. Benham was different. He and Steve clearly and professionally provided me with details on either procedure. In fact, Dr. Benham said I was a fine candidate for either procedure. I went with an fut procedure in late May 2019. Dr. Benham transplanted 1946 follicles which equated to roughly 3000 new hairs in my frontal region. Now, nearly 7 months later, the results are beyond my initial expectations. Each month my frontal region becomes thicker with new hair. I am completely satisfied with Dr. Benham and his team's work. I was quite serious in my research of doctors for this procedure. I had consultations with at least 6 doctors on the west coast. I felt most comfortable and assured with Dr. Benham and his team. While a few other doctors (mostly in LA) were pushing me toward the fue procedure, Dr. Benham and Steve, his assistant, were quite open and candid about all my options. I could go on and on. The bottom line is that whatever procedure you opt for, Dr. Benham is the clear choice.<//Review>

Dr. Sean is a very nice guy and takes time to answer all your questions and more importantly he is very honest and ethical during his consulation. He really has the patient's best interest in mind, I would highly recommend him if you are on the fence.

Update: I have been using the 8% minoxidil formula which is derived by Dr.Behnam's team. I have been using it for about four months now and I must say I have seen results - my crown area is much fuller then it used to be over the past 4 years since I have been dealing with hair thinning. My existing hair also have become fuller and stronger. Once again - Dr.Behnam and his team only have your best interest in their minds (which can't be said about many HT doctors). I walked into Dr.Behnam office in Jul 2019 when other doctors I visited recommended me for a HT on my crown, he advised me against it and instead asked me to use the 8% minoxidil formula, not only has this worked well but also saved me 1000's of dollars.

Conclusion: I would highly recommend patients to visit Dr.Behnam, there is reason why he has such a long backlog of patient consultations. He is honest, kind and a very talented doctor.< /review>

<Text>I was in a car accident in 2009 that left me with a laceration to the scalp, for which I needed medical attention  The resulting scar was about 2 inches across and about half an inch wide.  For 8 years I either had to comb my hair a certain way to hide the scar or had to wear a hat.  I visited Dr. Sean Behnam after reading positive reviews online about people who received hair transplants for balding and wondering if he could do something about my noticeable scar.  Dr. Sean told me that he could treat the scar with a FUE hair transplant procedure that would make the scar invisible.  I communicated to him my fear that the individual transplanted hairs would die in the scar tissue, but he reassured me that they would successfully graft and grow in the scar tissue because of the placental lining solution he uses in the FUE procedure.  I was told to take it easy for about three weeks after surgery, and I did do the follow-up care as Dr. Sean instructed.  The hair started growing out of the scar about three months later and the hair strands eventually become thicker, which surprised me.  The scar is gone.  I can now comb my hair normally and don't have to wear a hat when I cut my hair short.  Dr. Sean transformed my life.  I'm no longer conscientious about the scar like I use to be!  I highly recommend seeing Dr. Sean to treat scalp scars!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>Hoping this review would be helpful for some folks: I'm a performer and my wife thought I should get some professional help with my receding hairline so with her support I started looking into it. We first talk to another hair specialist and we didn't feel like we trusted him, that he gets my look and my needs -- I have never done a cosmetic procedure before and to me if I would it had to be perfect. My wife decided to get a second opinion and scheduled a free meeting with Dr. Sean. I'm really glad she did. We arrived for a free consultation and after meeting Dr. Sean I had no more doubts about what. i want to do and felt ready to give this a try. He gave me confidence in the process and the fact that unlike the other office he only has one patient per day just felt like the kind of attention for details I was looking for. Dr. Sean approach felt very artistic to me and the natural look of his works (he showed me loads of photos) was exactly what I was looking for. On top of that, he quoted me a much better price, almost half (!) of what the other doctor wanted for FUT and about 20% less for FUE. Dr. Sean explained everything in detail and there were no surprises the day of and the days after, it really seems like he enjoys his work. Dr. Sean and staff did everything they could to make me comfortable. All the post-op meeting were free and at my convenience. Dr. Sean was personally following up periodically to make sure everything is OK and always answered my concerns in a timely matter. I followed all the instructions as months went by and nothing showed for a while... And then, about 6 month after the procudure, the new hair started showing. A year later, the before and after photos are quite amazing and my hair feels and looks natural. I told Dr. Sean I was very grateful, he suggested I'd share my experience and here it is. I'm a very happy camper and wanted to recommend to talk to him if you need more info and you're considering investing in your hair. You'll find a very pleasant, experienced and honest individual who is on the top of the field that will genuinely care about you.<//text>< pictures>

I saw in the media how well-practiced and renowned Dr. Sean Behnam is so I scheduled my consultation. That's all it took to schedule the procedure. The procedure took a few hours and I got exactly what I wanted. My hairline is just like I wanted and I no longer need to wear a hat in public. I would not look elsewhere if you want to look GOOD!</text>

<review>Dr. Sean Behnam and his team/practice are great. He’s one of the few IAHRS (Google it) member doctors in not only the USA, but in the world. While definitely professional, Dr. Sean is also a fun and energetic guy. A stark comparison to some other doctors that I consulted with, who were a little more cold and reserved. It’s clear that Dr. Sean is very passionate about and good at what he does.

Dr. Sean (from my recollection) charges per graft, but doesn’t push patients to get more. He actually refused to transplant anything over 2,000 grafts for me. He said I might need those additional grafts later in life. Another, scammier doctor I met with agreed to transplant 3,000 grafts for me. That struck me as pretty telling, that Dr. Sean puts the wellbeing of his patients above his own financial gain.

He and his team are very transparent about the process and whether or not he thinks a patient will be a good fit. He doesn’t sell dreams; he is honest with managing expectations of his patients.

Patients are given his personal cell phone number to follow up with him whenever they’d like to. One time I asked him a question, and he recorded and sent me a selfie video message as a response.

He told me that I’d see full results from my transplant within 12-15 months, but I saw results that I was happy with as quickly as 4 months in. I can’t wait until my 12 month mark. My hair looks completely natural, and everyone tells me how great I look. Nobody has any idea that I had work done, unless I tell them.

If you, the reader, are considering hair transplant surgery, I recommend it, and I recommend Dr. Sean and his team. It has changed how I look at and feel about myself every time I glance in a mirror. If I could do it all over again, I would, and I would go back to Dr. Sean.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Dr. Sean is  MIRACLE WORKER! I had my procedure 1 year ago and I have growth in the spots that were BALD! After crying myself to sleep for weeks, I am now smiling and excited to be in public. I have hope now and I am beyond thankful for Dr. Sean. He literally saved me and I know he can do the same for you.<//text>< Time>

<Review>We looked around for a little while before deciding to go with Dr Sean. He stood out with his passion, dedication, and sound advice.

I heard about Dr. Behnam through the radio and from the consultation to the procedure, he and his staff made everything smooth and easy going. I got the procedure done about a month after the consultation and he was able to do everything effeciently without any hassles. If you're on the fence, don't worry and let Dr. Behnam and his staff take care of you. He really cares about his patients and the results will be great. I definitely recommend Dr. Behnam to anyone!< /text>

The following letter is what I wrote and forwarded to Dr. Sean Behnam's office moments ago.  It tells it all...

Tuesday, June 19, 2012

Dr. Sean Behnam & Staff
Dermatology and Hair Restoration
2825 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 303A
Santa Monica, CA 90404-2492

Dear Dr. Behnam and Staff:

I am writing to thank you all for the excellent service you have provided me in connection with my earlier consultation with you and the actual hair transplant this past Friday.

You gave me your time generously all along addressing my concerns and explaining each step to and including the day of the procedure.  However, what sets you apart even more from many others in the same field is that Doctor Behnam’s initial examination was methodical in the sense that before any number for the grafts was proposed, my hair density and particular attributes of my scalp were evaluated helping arrive at a realistic goal, rather than just “throwing numbers”, which I had seen by those with whom I had previously consulted elsewhere.

Yet, what sets you apart the most from the many in the field is your “one patient at a time” approach.  I could not be happier that I was going to have no less than 100% of your attention and care on the day of my procedure.

On the day of the procedure, your utmost diligence, exceptional care, command over the process, and attention to details were exceptional, which, I am confident, in time, will prove to have been paramount in our goal of achieving a natural look.

I have built my professional life and reputation upon my commitment to give my clients what they need with service that exceeds their expectations.  I have seen the same commitment in each and every one of you.  I can only hope that my clients are as pleased with me as I am with you.

Again, thank you for the outstanding care, excellent service, and giving me back my youth.

Gratefully,

Adam Nick</review>

< review>
Just had an FUE procedure done with Dr. Sean. It’s only been a week, so my review is based on the experience.
I live in the Bay Area but chose Dr. Sean after taking into account multiple factors: 1) member of IAHRS 2) Great reviews on Yelp and Google 3) Amazing Youtube video explaining in great details everything you need to know pre-op, op and post-op. 4) consultation was great. He went over everything: cost, what to expect, what not to expect and other details. 5) Amazing personality. Warm, friendly and professional. You can tell he absolutely loves what he’s doing and takes great pride in his work
I saw 3 others doctors in NorCal&SoCal + Bosley + virtual consultation from Turkey and finally selected Dr. Sean.
He personally called me the night of procedure, which was very kind of him
On the day of procedure, he evaluated whether FUT or FUE is better for me. We agreed to do FUE. He initially told me he will only do my front and probably no crown this time.
He had a hookah-style laughing gas to get me ready for the numbing. I have very low pain tolerance but I was okay with it. I laid on my stomach for 2 hours while Dr extracted the grafts. I had 1 bathroom break. I would recommend not drinking coffee the morning of operation. The less bathroom breaks you take and the less you move, the more grafts he can extract (don’t make him lose his momentum). He had 4 nurses who were taking the grafts from doctor and separating them into 1,2 and 3 hair follicles. He told me he was happy to actually extract ~2900 grafts for me!! Which was amazing news. Of course prior to operation I gave him the thumbs up that he can extract as much as possible.
We took a lunch break where I ate and watched his staff work on my grafts. After lunch, they started the insertion. Again, the hookah nitrogen gas and numbing. He made the incisions himself on the front and my crown which I was super happy about.  Once that part was done, two of his staff started inserting the grafts while he monitored them. The staff took turns so not to get tired. Remember, 2900 grafts means: 2900 drilling + 2900 extraction + 2900 incisions + 2900 planting!! So it’s A LOT of work. The doctor did the ~9000 first three parts himself and the staff did the last part. His staff were amazing!! We watched a movie and were talking about all sorts of things! It was fun.
The second part is tedious. You’re sitting for a good 4 hours or more. Your legs get super tired but thanks to the hookah laughing gas, you get through it somehow.
Overall, the procedure took almost 11 hours (including morning consultation and prep + lunch and operation and post operation). It’s a long day. I’m glad I’m stayed at the hotel next door to his office so I just walked back to hotel in like 30 seconds.
I saw the doctor next day and also on the day on my flight. He cleaned up my area, cleaned my hat for the airport and went over everything again.

I’ve been back for 2 days now. I send him pictures every morning for him to see and so far so good.

Overall, I was super happy with the experience. Amazing doctor, amazing staff. Let’s hope for amazing results soon (let’s hope for somewhere in between Elvis and George Constanta)

Will definitely update this review with results.

Thanks again Dr. Sean and your amazing staff.</review>

< Review>
Dr. Sean Behnam is the BEST of the BEST!

I did a ton of research before selecting Dr. Sean and I actually traveled from Hawaii to his office in California.  His office made it so easy, there is a nice hotel next door, and they arranged all of the accommodations.  All I had to do was check-in the night before the procedure date, and everything else was prepared and ready for me.

- FUE Procedure Day -

I arrived early in the morning and they started right away.  Dr. Sean only does one procedure per day, so 100% of the staff attention was on me, and I felt so comfortable the entire time.  The staff was very professional and they were so nice throughout the entire procedure.

There was almost no pain at all!  Dr. Sean has a special technique, that he developed himself, to numb his patients.  It not only makes it easier, but there are no needles!!!  Throughout the entire procedure Dr. Sean explained what was going on and was always available if I had any additional questions.

About half-way through the procedure Dr. Sean's staff brought me a delicious lunch, and they also provided great snacks throughout the day.  They really went above and beyond to make me comfortable!

Before I knew it, I was done!  It went quicker than I thought and I was ready to go back to my hotel room and relax.  They gave me a great post operation kit that had all of the supplies needed to properly clean and protect the procedure.

- Post Procedure -

I went back to his office the next day for a followup appointment and Dr. Sean looked over his work and answered all of my questions.  After that I flew back to Hawaii.  Dr. Sean called me often to make sure things were still looking good, and if I had any questions I could text him directly!  He always would take the time to answer my questions.  It has been 10 Months since my procedure and he still checks in with me to see how I am doing!

- Results -

It has now been 10 Months since the procedure and I could not be happier!  The results are amazing,  and no one has ever asked if I have had hair transplants.  Dr Sean is very talented in the placement of the follicles, he makes the hairline look completely natural. I am in the water almost everyday and I never have to worry about my hairline. (Before the procedure I would put a hat on the second I would get out of the water so people wouldn’t see my hairline).  I have so much more confidence in myself and it was sooooooo worth it!  He totally has a special skill!  The density is better than I expected and I feel and look great!

Dr. Sean truly cares about his patients and I feel part of the family.  I would totally recommend Dr. Sean to family and friends.< /Review>

<review>I can't say enough about how pleased I am with the results of my FUE transplant. I am a registered nurse and to say that I am wary of any and all medical procedures would be a massive understatement. I did a tremendous amount of research and watched many Youtube videos. After much deliberating I decided to go with Dr. Sean ... best decision ever!!! It has been 8 months and my hairline looks fantastic. The transition between my previously existing hairline and the new grafts is virtually seamless. I would post pics but for the sake of anonymity I would rather not. Believe me when I say the work is sublime. If you are considering undergoing this procedure with Dr. Sean allow me to lay your fears to rest. The man does amazing work nuff said!</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I went in on May 1st for my FUE transplant.  I was scared as hell, but Dr. Behnam and his staff eased my worries.  The 10 hours I was there went by pretty fast, and they made sure that I was in no pain.  We had conversation, watched movies, they gave me Mahi Mahi (mmmm), and after that they gave me the option to stay in a hotel.  I said no, as I wanted to just go home.  Instructions were provided to me and I followed them with a little human error, but after 7 months most of the hair has already grown in.  It looks great.  The doctor gave me my life back .  You really can't tell any surgery was done, it was in the back of my head, where I had a huge baldspot that everyone loved to always comment on.  I will always recommend this doctor to people on the fence of doing this. It's worth it.  Get your life back while you can! This doctor is the best, hands down. Also, he is an active researcher and contributor to technologies advancing the field, which I find very awesome!  Thanks again guys!  BEST EVER</Text>

Dr. Behnam is an exceptional physician. I just had my transplant done 2 weeks ago and am already seeing significant growth. Him and his wonderful team of nurses have made this procedure as stress free and pain free as possible. So if you are in the greater Los Angeles area and are considering having this procedure done. I asssure you Dr. Behnam and his staff are both compitent, capable and experienced! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!<//Review>

First of all Dr. Sean really did his thing I can't believe my results. I spent 5 months researching doctors, specifically one that specializes in African American hair. Once I had my consultation I knew right away I was in good hands, dr sean talked me through every step of the procedure and what to expect post op. What I most love about Dr sean is his constant communication after the service, Yes Dr Sean calls you to make sure you're doing well with post care I never felt like a "patient" I feel like family! I was comfortable during my procedure it was done before I knew it went home rested two days and was back to regular activity in two days,  and my hair is flourishing just after 5 months! He's really passionate about hair, his excitement and love for his job is what helped make this the best experience. And you have to try the protein Shakes! Not only my hair, but my nails are so healthy and long with no breaking I can't make this up dead ass serious! He's the best. DO NOT look any further. DrSean Behnman is the best!<//review>

< Review>
My name is Chris Kreuz and heard Dr Behnam hair Restoration procedure and have always wanted to get this procedure. Since i met Dr. Behnam he made me feel very comfortable in my consultation and I decided to get the procedure done this week . I could not believe their was no pain to the procedure and his staff and every part of the experience was above my expectations . I have probable only done a review twice before so for me to right a review. I highly recommend the procedure don't put it off and only go to Dr. Behnam you will feel well taken care of it.

< Review>
Back in 2012 my doctor recommended Dr. Behnam when I asked about a hair restoration specialist. That alone says a lot because anyone my doctor recommends is usually excellent in both medical skills and people skills. I still shopped around for a bit but had the hair graft procedure done shortly after with Dr. Behnam. Very quickly I knew I would write them a glowing review, but also knew from doing research beforehand (shopping around) that most of the reviews were from people who'd recently gotten the procedure done, so I thought I'd wait a bit.
So finally after 2 years I decided it's about time I write this review, because after all this time I'm still just as impressed with my experience there. They are extremely people-friendly, it feels more like visiting family than going to a clinic (his twin brother's dermatologist practice is in the same office so it does have a family practice feel.) He's the only doctor I've ever known that actually gives his cell phone number after surgery, so if you have any issues / questions you can contact him immediately. That's amazing- I don't think any other doctor does that.
Even though my doctor recommended Dr. Behnam I still shopped around and quickly found that Dr.  Behnam's practice had the best rates around- I figured probably in part because they have a nice office on the second floor instead of a 7th floor penthouse like some practices, but it's also obvious that Dr. Behnam is not in it for the money- and ultimately that's what makes the biggest difference here. Contrary to so many places, he only does one procedure per day. So you get his full attention and all his effort and energy on doing the best possible job for you instead of rushing through you to get to the next guy on the list. Every other place I looked into did at least 2 patients per day. (one morning, one afternoon)
As for the procedure itself, I was very satisfied with the results and the operation itself. They made me feel comfortable the day of, and after just a few months waiting for the grafts to grow, for the first time in years I could comb my hair backwards instead of hiding my bald spot.
Included in the price are visits for the laser chair thing, which helps stimulate hair growth. So after all those visits I really came to see that these guys are the real deal. Just good people passionate about what they do, no bullshit, and doing a really good job. If you are not a good candidate for the procedure, he will tell you. That kind of honesty is hard to find in an industry that is known for greedily exploiting people's insecurities.
So yeah, in conclusion I highly recommend Dr. Behnam!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Dr. Sean is a very experienced and trustworthy doctor. In June, Dr. Sean underwent hairline surgery, and the whole operation went smoothly, which made me very nervous and relaxed. He and his team also provided me with a lot of ways to relieve pain and relax during the operation. Thank you very much to everyone who participated in the operation.
After the operation, I was given a bag of medical items, medicines and vitamins that would help my hair.
Moreover, Dr. Sean's Follow up has also been very careful. In the next few days of the operation, he asked me about his condition and updated his surgical area every day. He patiently answered all my questions. And after a month of surgery, I will actively ask about my progress. Dr. Sean is a doctor who feels relieved.
The next step is to wait for the hair to grow out slowly, looking forward to the effect.
Dr. Sean is highly recommended here!

Dr. Sean是一位经验非常丰富，值得信耐的医生。6月在Dr. Sean这里做了植发际线手术，整个手术过程都很顺利，让本来非常紧张的我得到放松。他和他的Team在手术过程中也为我提供了很多减缓疼痛放松心情的方法，非常感谢每一位参与手术的人士。
手术完之后，送给我一袋医疗物品，药物和对头发有帮助的维他命。
而且Dr. Sean的Follow up也做的非常细心，在手术接下来的几天都询问我的状况，每天更新自己的手术区域，他再耐心的解答我所有的疑问。并且在手术一个月之后也会主动询问我的进展，Dr. Sean是一位让人感觉到安心的医生。
接下来就是等头发慢慢长出来的过程了，期待效果。
在此非常推荐Dr. Sean！</Review>

(Translated by Google) Impeccable work and service that I highly recommend!

From the first free consultation, during which he does an objective analysis and projection while taking your expectations into account, until the day of the procedure, Dr. Sean takes great care to prepare you in the best possible way and in the best possible conditions.
A team of 4 people is 100% dedicated to you during (often) the 2 days that the operation lasted.

The hair transplantation procedure was performed by the FUE method. A method almost under pain and without sequelae (procedure performed over a year ago). He will be able to explain the different methods that exist very well.

Professional support before and after the operation to obtain the best possible results.

This procedure was something I dreaded because there is no room for error. Dr. Sean was able to give me confidence by clearly explaining the steps and means used to make the operation a success.

I couldn't have gotten better service anywhere in Los Angeles. I have met several specialists in hair transplants but, Dr. Sean really stood out, I do not regret choosing him and highly recommend him to anyone wishing to have a hair transplant.

Un travail et service irréprochables que je recommande très fortement!

Depuis la première consultation gratuite, pendant laquelle il fait une analyse et une projection objectives tout en prenant en compte vos attentes, jusqu’au jour la procédure, Dr. Sean prend grand soin de vous préparer au mieux et dans les meilleures conditions possibles.
Une équipe de 4 personnes vous est dédiée à 100% pendant (souvent) les 2 jours qu’a duré l’opération.

La procédure de transplantation de cheveux a été réalisée par la méthode FUE. Une méthode quasiment sous douleur et sans séquelles (procédure réalisée il y a plus d’un an). Il saura très bien vous expliquer les différentes méthodes qui existent.

Un accompagnement professionnel pré et post opération qui permet d’obtenir les meilleurs résultats possibles.

Cette procédure était quelque chose que je redoutais car il n’y a pas de droit à l’erreur. Dr. Sean a su me donner confiance en m’expliquant clairement les étapes et les moyens employés afin que l’opération soit un succès.

Je n’aurais pas pu obtenir meilleur service autre part à Los Angeles. J’ai rencontré plusieurs spécialistes dans la greffe de cheveux mais, Dr. Sean est vraiment sorti du lot, je ne regrette pas de l’avoir choisi et le recommande vivement à toute personne désireuse de procéder à une transplantation de cheveux.</Review>

I am glad to say that we had a awesome evening and the place was evidently one of the reasons for that successful evening. The team  collaborated in a pleasant way, the cooking was great and my buddies were so  overjoyed. We shall surely come back again for more celebrations. thanks very much.<//review>< time>

Food is amazing!!! Very reasonably priced. Customer service top notch...Jose is priceless! We stopped by just as they had closed but Jose informed us they had a private party coming in so we were more then welcome to place an order and he would make it for us. He prepared our food and even offered us to dine in if we wanted. He was most attentive and genuinely helpful!!! We have found our #1 Mediterranean place 😊!!!< /review>

By far the best, most delicious, falafals in the entire valley. Moist and cooked perfectly. Most are dry, these change the game.< /review>

I heard they had the best falafel on the west coast and my god they were amazing. Crispy on the outside and perfect wet texture on the inside. They were super flavorful and so savory.

The Moroccan cigars you can tell are home made and made with love. These are not frozen from restaurant depot. Each is hand rolled and stuffed with meaty goodness.

Hummus was fresh and perfectly spiced. The pita were also warm, fluffy and toasted to perfection.

If you are down for some Cholent or Jachnun - both Shabbat delicacies. Then come on Sunday and these items are LIT.

Their grilled chicken plate was super flavorful and just so fresh and light. I can eat that all day.

The ambiance is fresh, airy and most importantly CLEAN. I met the owners, a very sweet and welcoming Israeli woman and her Moroccan husband. You get the feeling they transported their home countries to the Valley and all of the hospitality, flavors, and dishes are made with that purpose.

Would go again!

P.S. the pickled veggie bar, the home made olives, the nana tea, the Turkish coffee, the baklava bites, the cabbage salad... all spot on.</review>

Best falafel I've had since Israel where I actually worked at a very tasty falafel shop for a few months. This is the real deal, and trust me -I tried plenty of places that didn't check out. Owner is very nice, and so are the staff. Great place to sit and eat with friends in a laid back,  authentic Israeli restaurant.< /Review>

<review>Not sure about all the negative reviews... We went there today for the first time and the place was clean, the people were nice, and the food was awesome.  Will go back again.  And I disagree with the food category: it's not Moroccan, it's definitely Israeli.<//review>< Pics>

I love falafel, and the falafel at Star Falafel Grill is good. The people here are so nice and it is the only place I have found in the valley that serves Turkish coffee. One thing they can work on is the decor. This is not a very comfortable atmosphere and I wouldn't come here with my family or with my friends to meet up and have lunch. I also wasn't really a fan of their tahini sauce, which I thought was very bland.<//Text>

The food is strange... we ordered delivery for our office, and all four dishes weren’t that well received. The salad had a mix of cooked warm broccoli and cold lettuce. The chipotle pasta was very spicy but lacking actual flavor — the sausage was oddly so bland you wouldn’t know what you were eating. Shrimp scampi was flavorless, pizza was OK but not great by any means.<//Review>

I am the one who posted the photo of the Shrimp Scampi, oh, you didn’t recognize it by the photo??? It was the one swimming in Alfredo sauce, and you thought it was Fettuccine, tsk tsk. Now, I have a dairy allergy and can eat dairy if I decide to take a my meds prior to. So I wasn’t at all prepared to see an extremely creamy sauce with a side of noodles. Correct me if I’m wrong, but shouldn’t Shrimp Scampi be a pasta of minimal sauce? I thought so, could be just how it is prepared here, tasted like Alfredo sauce mixed with Tabasco, no red rooster lol... Please get it together Palermo, you have one job.

PS. The customer service was excellent, I’ll be barfing this up in a few, wish me luck 👍🏾< /Review>

It changed from the last time i was there.
The burger was 10/10 amazing sauce.
The pizza was also delicious.
I believe they are under new management after reading the previous reviews.</Text>

I was in town on business. Found that this place was close to my hotel. I ordered a "fresh mozzarella and tomato pizza" as well as some meatballs. If you like large frozen meatballs, you will love theirs as they are not fresh. Pizza was ok. Will probably not order again.<//text>

Stop #46 for @pizzas365: Palermo's Pizza has a pretty standard, pretty average pizza. Maybe a bit too greasy. Everything else is fine and nothing more. 3.0 Stars.</Review>

We ordered a cheeseburger, a pepperoni roll, and some pasta. My wife didn't seem to mind the pasta too much. The burger was so disgusting, I had to throw it out after a few bites; the meat seemed low-quality and there was some weird sauce on it. The pepperoni roll was neither bad nor good.

Their motto seems to be "quantity over quality".<//Text>< Pics>

I called and was on the phone with the guy 12 mins because he kept putting me on hold. All for him to move the phone for a couple of seconds and just hang up. I called back and he still had me on hold. Bad customer service...<//Review>

< review>
I have ordered from Palermo's Pizza twice. The first time it took an hour and 15 mins for me to receive my delivery which was cold when it arrived. I live about two miles from the restaurant. I called the restaurant and they adjusted my bill. I appreciated the customer service and ordered from them again a few weeks later. This time the delivery arrived within an hour. I ordered the pizza pasta combo. The pizza was cold. The pasta (fettuccini) came with meat sauce, which was not listed on the menu and seemed odd. It tasted ok. That night I had such a bad stomach ache that I had trouble sleeping. For the next five days that followed that meal I had food poisoning. I called the restaurant to complain and the manager said nonchalantly  "oh yeah, a lot of people got sick."  So if you want cold food or E. coli then this is the spot for you.</review>

<Text>Rita, on E Valley Parkway was such a great help! I never thought I would need a payday loan, and she definitely made everything so easy and so smooth! She made sure to double check what informs I needed to have and was able to have done electronically if I did not have the correct forms, or missing forms. It was all straight forward and made everything. Process was so quick and easy. Customer service was amazing and Rita was so sweet. Definitely would recommend coming here !<//Text>< gmap_id>

Having to inquire about a loan can often be an embarrassing or uncomfortable experience, especially when it’s an advance on EDD unemployment, but Jeremy made the whole process a smooth and relaxed encounter. While helping me with my thousand questions, he was also courteously assisting a newer employee, but maintained focus on me and made me feel he was genuinely intent on making sure I was comfortable, educated, and that I felt tended to. An A++ in customer service and a great guy to have working the front of any operation. And did I mention they give advances on EDD? Crucial when emergencies pop up because we don’t choose when we might need some extra emergency cash. Thanks!< /Review>

Only amazing things to say about this place. Maryann has made my experience here so delightful. Every time I call or go in she is always in a wonderful mood and even brightens up my day with how positive she is. I would recommend this place to everyone. The service I received here is the best I ever received. I would recommend this loan company over any other.< /text>

<review>Jeremy was extra helpful and took all the time I needed to make sure I understood every step in the process.  He went WAY above and beyond normal customer service. He is a Super Dupper Employee!!! I hope his bosses understand and acknowledge what a superb asset Jeremy is to this business.<//review>< pictures>

Compassionate, caring and understanding!
Jeremy is an amazing manager. He helped me and my family in our time of need! My wife is going thru Chemotherapy and times are rough. Jeremy made my whole week because of his heartfelt actions! 10 stars are deserved for this location</text>

<Text>This place is amazing. When ever I run into a financial emergency I know I can just run over and get the help I need. I want to personally acknowledge Joey and Jeremy, they are awesome employees. I have had the pleasure of having them help me the last two times I have been in. I had fractured my back and they had remembered that from the last time I came in and were asking how I was doing now etc... Very friendly and have me in and out in less than 5 mins. I would recommend this place to anyone in a bind. Thanks again Joey and Jeremy!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) I've been coming to this Advance America for a while, I've never paid my payments late. In April I started working 2 jobs and unfortunately I couldn't keep coming to pay my payments in person, so I decided to bring my checking account information and sign up for Automatic Payments. Lisette helped me make copies of my checks. I later found out that Advance America did not deduct any payments from My bank account. I spoke to Lisette again and she told me that advance america was unable to withdraw money from my account. However, I can prove with my bank statements that I have and had money in my account. I have been calling for the last 3 weeks trying to contact the District Manager, Lisette and the other boy are bringing me nothing but wasting time. Diecie is going to call you AND NOTHING. Today I called again and they kept me on hold for almost 20 minutes. All I want to do is pay the balance and close the account, I don't want to receive any more surcharges. The customer service is Horrible I am very unhappy and genuinely disturbed by the lack of professionalism this store has ... Every time I call it is pure lies. They tell me we'll call you later and they don't call. Horrible customer service and ZERO professionalism. I am a very understanding and patient man, but this is already unacceptable. It benefits them not to call me like that they keep charging me surcharges, Horrible customer service, I was one of their best clients, no more ... DON'T COME

I started coming to this location a while back, I have never been late on my payments, In April I started working 2 jobs and unfortunately I was not able to make my payments in person so i decided to bring my checking account information and enroll in automatic Payments. Lisette helped me she made copies of my checks. Later I found out Advance America did not deduct any payments from My account I spoke to Lisette again and she said that advance America was not able to take the money out of my account, However I can prove with my bank statements that I have money in the account. I've been calling for the past 3 weeks trying to get a hold of the district manager and she has not called me, Today I called again and they had me on Hold for almost 20 minutes, All I want to do Is pay the balance and close the account, I don't want to get anymore late fees. The customer service is Horrible I am very unhappy and genuinely disturbed by the unprofessionalism this store has every time I call they tell me we will call you back later today and I get no call back. Horrible customer service and etiquette skills, ZERO professionalism. I am a very understanding and patient man but this is already too Much.
It benefits them not to call me so they can continue to charge me surcharges, Horrible customer service, I was one of their best customers, But I will never come again. STAY AWAY

Tengo Tiempo viniendo a esta Advance America, nunca e pagado mis pagos tarde. En abril comencé a trabajar en 2 trabajos y lamentablemente no pude seguir viniendo a pagar mis pagos en persona, así que decidí traer la información de mi cuenta de cheques y inscribirme en Pagos automáticos. Lisette me ayudó a hacer copias de mis cheques. Más tarde descubrí que Advance America no dedujo ningún pago de Mi cuenta de banco. Hablé con Lisette nuevamente y me dijo que advance america no pudo retirar el dinero de mi cuenta. Sin embargo, puedo demostrar con mis estados bancarios que tengo y tenia dinero en mi cuenta. He estado llamando las últimas 3 semanas tratando de contactar ala Manager del distrito, lisette y el otro muchacho me traen nadamas perdiendo el tiempo Dieciendome te va a llamar Y NADA.  Hoy llamé nuevamente y me tuvieron en espera por casi 20 minutos. Todo lo que quiero hacer es pagar el saldo y cerrar la cuenta, no quiero recibir más recargos. El servicio al cliente es Horrible Estoy muy descontento y genuinamente perturbado por la falta de profesionalismo que tiene esta tienda... Cada vez que llamo son puras mentiras. Me dicen que lo llamaremos más tarde y no llaman. Horrible servicio al cliente y ZERO de profesionalismo. Soy un hombre muy comprensivo y paciente, pero esto ya es inaceptable. Les beneficia no llamarme así me siguen cobrando recargos, Horrible servicio al cliente, Yo era uno de sus mejores clientes, no más... NO VENGAN

< Review>
This was my first visit to Dan's Optical and I was impressed! Covid protocols were in place and strictly followed, which made me feel very safe. Every single member of the staff was friendly and professional; the doctor was kind and knowledgeable; the frames specialist was patient and helpful. At each step of the process, my questions were answered and I never felt rushed. It was a truly pleasant experience. Thank you!</Review>

Very prompt and courteous staff. My doctor was so helpful and took the time to explain things to me. I would like to spotlight one amazing receptionist. Her name is Carol and I had to stop on the way out to tell her what an amazing person she is. She helped me get set up an appointment to get my first Covid-19 vaccination the first time I came in. Two days later, when I came back for a follow up, I observed her be very caring and professional with several other patients, including leaving her chair to walk around and bring someone back their insurance card and to give 2 little girls some stickers after their appointment, telling them how brave they were. All the while, she was being kind to her fellow staff members. Thank You, Carol!!</review>

My Dr is fantastic. All the services are fantastic.  The only issue I have is they said they don't take my insurance.  My insurance changed and on my last appt is when I found out that they don't accept Anthem Insurance of any kind. Why I don't know but they said they would bill it this time, but I may have to switch Dr because of it which I would hate to do because I really like my Dr there and have had him for about 7 yrs.<//text>

The receptionists are so nice. The optometrist and his helper are very nice and professional. They set me at ease when I got my eye drops put in ( lol I can’t spell dialated)! They have a good selection of frames and the purchase was simple with the personal attention I got! Best of all I can see so much better now!!!! Thanks Dr. Laya!</Text>

<Review>I have been a patient at SCHC for years. My Dr has moved to the enterprise area and he is still amazing but the check in process is absolutely unacceptable. I was there and it took the older lady about 30 minutes before even acknowledging me. Then while I was filling out the simple form there were patients come in and just waiting in line there was about 15 people waiting for her to even look up at them. The door way was packed. The other two there were to check the patients were busy. One was on the phone and still trying to check in the patients, the other lady was dealing with an angry man, I was not upset with them but the older lady that was the main check in lady was rude, slow and messed up who I am multiple times. It took a while to get called back into the other rooms but that’s understandable since my Dr is popular so that didn’t bother me. But at the end of our visit I would wait hours to see my Dr! He is amazing. Just wish he didn’t move over to the enterprise area. I understand it’s new and in a hard time, I’m hoping that it will all get settled soon! And I hope it will start to move faster. All over the way it’s ran... slow and not really acceptable but I wouldn’t change my Dr for anything. So as long as he’s there I will go there.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Experience was great very friendly. We called there office and was able to be seen the next day. My husband and I were able to be seen together to get our eye exams to get new glasses.  Mine was done the next day and his was done the following week. No long wait to receive our glasses, and the selection to chose from was amazing.  We definitely recommend this office.< /Review>

This a great facility to come to for health care. Its clean everyone's got a smile for you,they are polite & treat you with the respect every human being deserves. Everyone of the staff are so very helpful. The doctors take the time, an are very kind and compassionate. They understand you don't feel well, an are very patient with EVERYONE equally.  A great clinic to be apart of. I'm glad I  have this clinic to turn to when I'm sick. The  Doctors & all the staff that works there help everyone who comes in to feel better.  Also I'd like to take the time to THANK Doctor Villalobos, for helping keep me as healthy as possible & taking the extra time to LISTEN AN CARE for me, an my health issues these last approx. 5 years, an just basically being there. Hes a Doctor with a smile for EVERYONE !!  An the most POSITIVE & POLITE DOCTOR IVE HAD THE PLEASURE  OF KNOWING!!!!**  This is a grade A+ Clinic***** 🤗< /review>

< review>
I love Shasta Community Health Center it is the best care by far in Shasta County but their vision center is the worst I have ever been to. I went to check in for my appointment and it smelled like an ashtray it was so over bearing. Then went up to the front desk, the lady started coughing so hard she almost threw up on the floor then ran to the bathroom. I was just standing there. She came back and said she need a covid 19 shot so she got on the phone and scheduled one. So I went to the next person to check in. The exam was very burtal the lady was very ruff checking my eye preasure and putting in 2 different eye drops she made my eyes red because of how hard he held my eye lids open. She sat me out in the waiting room to wait another 20min with blurry vision and dilated red eyes. Then they took me to a dark room to wait for 1 hour for the doctor to show up even though I had an appointment. I had so many questions because I couldn't even see my hands or anything anymore from the eye drops. This was my 1st eye exam so I did not know what to expect. Finally the doctor showed up. The first thing he asked me to do was put a tissue under my mask for his safety and I was thinking you should be concerned about your receptionist coughing all over the place and I should be concerned for my safety. He did not check for why I was originally there in the first place then asked me to come back again to check for what my  appointment was for but im pretty sure it was because it was close to closing time. If he wouldn't of made me wait and hour not counting the 40min before that in the waiting room they would of had time to properly finish my appointment. He also asked me to go to the last eye doctor from 3 years ago when I had an eye infection to get paperwork just to see if my vision changed from then to now. To me how would that change anything about my situation it is a waste of my time, gas, and that will not change my current vision now. I was asked multiple times if I wanted glasses to make a sale and I have perfect vision in 1 eye and the other is just a bit blurry. I will never come back to this place poor service all around. There are many eye doctors in shasta County pick any one of them but here. I could barley drive home my eyes were so blurry.<//review>

I went to the new and improved Churn Creek / Enterprise Shasta Community Health Center this week. The staff was friendly. The  assistant (Orephin sp?)pleasant and attentive. The PA Maegan Gautam was one of the best physician's assistants I have had the pleasure of dealing with. She made sure that my questions were answered and was proactive in providing services. Thank You. Ps plus parking/sign in was so much better than Placer< /Review>

We took our Genesis in to Stockton Hyandi for the 60,000 mile check up. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. The gentleman in the service department was very efficient and got our service going right away. He explained the different types of service and wasn’t pushy in trying to talk me into more than I needed. Simply gave me the info and let me decide what I wanted done. Everyone we dealt with from start to finish was very friendly.<//review>

I popped in unexpectedly, after I had a hybrid system failure while driving on the freeway. I contacted Stockton Hyundai and they said to tow it right there.

It has been about 3 years since I have been there, as I get oil changed elsewhere. However, I walked in and Xavier immediately recognized me and even remembered my name. This guy is a class act. Although my car is now past warranty, he still fought to get it covered. Hyundai wasn't having it, but I truly appreciate the effort.

I was given a promise date and price. Not only did they get it done a day early, it came in slightly under the estimate. My only gripe, is that the mechanic forgot to completely closed the hood. Had it not been for a really windy day, I would not have noticed it. It could have been worse, but it was caught before anything happened.

Aside from that I love Stockton Hyundai and I love my car. After 110,000 miles, this is the first time I have had a problem...and it didn't break the bank. That's reliability that will keep me around for a long time.< /Text>

<review>As a small business owner punctuality and delivering my vehicle back to me on time is Paramont. Probably as it is just as important to anyone even like people that do not rely on their vehicles for their business. My experience with Stockton Hyundai is absolutely outstanding I wish I can give them six ⭐️ Stars. In fact it wasn’t just the service department that was great sales person helped me and one of the managers I believe his name was Joey actually came and answered my questions after hours which was fabulous to have somebody actually answering the phone for a change. If you want great service at a great price this is the place for you  Joe Nicolai<//review><time>1622131238236<//time>< user_name>

Great experience getting a new Kona from James and Hugo.  I was given the best price I had seen from any dealer in California without any hidden extras. They we both very professional and knowledgeable about the car.  I came from out of town and James arranged to pick me up from the airport.  Definitely recommend.< /Text>

This was the routine 15,000 mile service. Easy appointment set-up online. Quick handling by the service writer when I arrived. The car was taken into the shop area immediately . The technicians did the service I requested. The car was returned to me as clean as I left it. Reasonable price. Factory-trained technicians know the vehicle. Clean, comfortable customer waiting area. Satisfactory experience in every way.<//text>

Stephen was great he made sure that any issue that came about when financing my car he took care of! He definitely handled business, He worked all day to make sure the best option for me was chosen ! And I had a few things pulling against me but I expressed how badly I needed a car and he made sure that I left in one ! Thank you to the whole staff who helped me, Alex and James as well you both did a lot to make me feel welcome and at ease ! I love my car thank you !< /text>

This was our best car buying experience ever! Our salesman, Carlos answered all our questions, was polite, respectful, never pushy, and was a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend him as he was excellent! The paperwork process was streamlined and easy. Our finance experience with Abdul was excellent as well. If you want a Hyundai I would highly recommend Stockton Hyundai!</Text>

Yes!! It was a great experience! I just came to get my car appraised and Ernie swayed me into getting a Sonota, which I loved. Then Brian came in and sealed the deal, gave me an offer I couldn’t refuse. Looool sounds kinda cliche but it was great!! 10/10
Would recommend, really friendly people and really attentive!< /Text>

<review>We bought a used car and worked with Carlos. He was a great salesman! No pressure, very knowledgeable and personable. He made the process as smooth and quick as possible, although it still took a while. The only negative to us is that my husband asked if they could fill the car up with gas (it had half a tank) and the response was “I’m sorry, we don’t do that for used cars.” The response indicated that had we purchased a new car we would have gotten a full tank of gas. I believe a customer is a customer no matter what they are purchasing, and it was off-putting to feel like we weren’t good enough to have a full tank. It’s a small thing, but for us we had driven a long way to get the car and could have chosen another dealership to buy from, but we chose Hyundai Stockton. A customer wants to feel valued. Other than that and the paperwork taking much longer than it should have given we were paying cash, it was a pleasant experience and a very nice dealership.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I drive here over an hour because folsom hyundai is shady. The Stockton location is always straight-forward, quick, responsive, and everybody there is personable. I purchased my first new vehicle through them and I go there for all of my services. Thanks for everything! Will buy from here again 👍< /Review>

Everyone I spoke with was very friendly.  There was plenty of room in the waiting area, and I was there for 1.5 hrs when I expected to be there longer. I took a star off because I read on the website that when I came in for a recall, my car would be returned to me washed, and it wasn’t. That was disappointing.< /review>

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of 1 is because I love the front desk.

2 hours for a simple oil change, and I had an appointment, this made me late for my work meeting.

I will never schedule service on Friday again< /review>

<text>Chris was extremely helpful, and seemed genuinely happy to help us purchase a new car.
He listened to what we were looking for, and then found the perfect one. And obtained an awesome financing deal for us.
I definitely recommend Stockton Hyundai for a no pressure and easy car buying experience.

Steven delivered the car right to our house, even though it was raining and dark. He was very kind and helpful, we really appreciate his great attitude.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ive have been thinking of getting a new car and my sister recommend Stockton Hyndai and to ask for Chris Preciado.  So i did and yes this man was very helpfu knowable and midful of my request. Even hospitable. Thank you Chris.. The only part that I feel could of went better is when i went to the next person for finances. When signing paper work i had to to be sure what i was signing. Me asking question just so i could be assured and confident on what i was signing , kinda made me second guess myself . i felling like he was unhappy with me asking. Either way good experience in the end thanks guys @ Stockton Hyndai< /text>

These guys are the best!  The engine seized in my brand new 2020 Hyundai Kona and the dealer I purchased it from tried to tell me that it was because I took it to an after market oil change shop (I won't mention that the salesman at that store failed to mention to me that I had 3 years/36,000 miles maintenance free).  So when I told the oil change about this, they towed my car to Stockton Hyundai.  My service advisor, Xavier, told me they would be submitting the claim to Hyundai corporate and allowing them to determine whether or not the engine would be covered under warranty.  Turns out it was and I now have a brand new engine thanks to Xavier and the awesome service staff at Stockton Hyundai.  Even though it's inconvenient for me, you'd better believe I'll be taking my car all the way to Stockton Hyundai for service from now on!< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I will never in my life purchase another Hyundai. Not only do they have an issue with premature engine failure, the Stockton service center is an absolute JOKE. I have been a loyal customer for the last 5 years and I’ve never had any mechanical issues. Well shortly after getting an oil change my engine started making a propeller noise. I called Hyundai to schedule an appointment for a diagnostic and was told it would be $300. However when my boyfriend called he was told it would only be $167. They told me my piston failed and was grinding causing flakes of metal to get into my oil and ruin my engine. Apparently every time they change my oil nobody has ever paid attention. I was told they could submit a good cause claim for me since I am a loyal customer and it was possible I could get the engine repaired free of cost. It was supposed to take one week. Well 2 weeks later I’m having to hound them to figure out what’s going on with my car. Every time I call they need something different. When they needed my registration did anyone call me? No. Do they answer the phone when you call? NO. Today I was told that the main Hyundai office is requesting more detailed information on my engine issues. However the mechanics don’t want to waste anymore time on my car (his words) because they don’t feel that my engine will be covered. The only way they will continue working on my car to give the main Hyundai office what they need is if I agree to pay for the labor myself. How does that even make sense? So basically I never had a chance to get my engine replaced at no cost because they never intended on finding the root of the problem without me opening up my wallet. When I spoke to the service manager to express my concern he reiterated that if I don’t pay them the mechanics don’t get paid. I’m sorry are they not paid by the hour? My whole issue is the process was never explained to me. If id known the only way to even possibly be approved was to pay thousands of dollars for them to rip my engine apart i would’ve never even left my car there in the first dam place. They need to give customers all the facts before Wasting everyone’s time. I also don’t feel like I should have to keep calling for updates about the car. Why can’t anyone at the store keep me in the loop? I even told the service manager that if I hadn’t came up there making a big stink about it I don’t think anyone would’ve called me to inform me. HE AGREED! How is that okay? Is that the Hyundai standard? He even tried to pass the buck to the CSR because he didn’t keep men informed. Ultimately it falls on the service manager you’re the leader and you set the standard. How about you do a little better.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>When I purchased my new Genesis, Stockton Hyundai took the time to explain how to work everything in my fancy car. It was a pleasant experience.

UPDATE: I had my first service check on my new car. I went to Stockton Hyundai to have the service done. The key with any service place is to make an early appointment; nine times out of 10; you will be in and out with no issues. I still had the same excellent service and, once again, a pleasant experience.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It was a quiet Sunday afternoon. I was greeted by Christopher  Preciado after I entered the building.  He first asked if I had spoken to anyone. I liked that because that shows respect for the other sales staff. He was very polite and friendly.  We talked about what I was looking for. After a few minutes we walked outside so he could not only show me a vehicle but he went on to point out and show me how everything worked. Very impressive! The vehicle i settled on had just arrived so it had not yet been assigned a stock number. From meeting the sales manager to finance manager, everyone was wonderful.  No high pressure from anyone. I liked that. The time from agreeing on a price to getting out of finance took about 30 minutes.

I've purchased many vehicles over the years. I've had some wonderful and not so wonderful experiences.  I can't remember any that was less stressful and as quick as my experience was with Stockton Hyundai.

I highly recommend Stockton Hyundai for your next new or used vehicle.< /Text>

Honestly best experienced within a big company i ever had.. they had me in and out with no problems at all between Xavier the service rep keeping me up to date with everything on my vehicle and always there on the phone if i had questions, to the service manager actually working on my car and giving me his honest opinions on what my vehicle would need and how to go about it without forcing parts or unnecessary repairs to be done. Also stephen, chris, and Terry are the best guys to talk about trade In's or looking to get into something different not once did they get annoying or persistent. Also if you see a light skin tall gentleman named Jimmy hes a lot attendant that made sure i had gas and rental was detailed upon recieving it. Just overall great service with an outstanding staff.< /review>

Awesome people! Friendly, accomodating, and willing to work out a deal for our benefit. Very easy to talk with by getting to know them personally. Felt very comfortable dealing with them. Not like other dealers that just focus on one goal. Very personable and honest. Not the newest facility but felt very taken care of. Would drive this far again to get the kind of experience I received.< /Review>

With the challenge of these times of Covid and not driving much, my service schedule is way off based upon the normal usage. I appreciate that the service department didn’t try to sell me a service I didn’t need.

Also, they got my car scheduled quickly and the service was done in a timely manner.<//text></record></dataset><record>

We understand you wanted to go through your own financial institution which we helped you with. As far as your first monthly payment due date, various banks have different programs regarding that subject. Sometimes lenders have special incentives for their clients that the dealers are not allowed to give out. We called your lender prior to your delivery of your vehicle and had them explain to us the process of how to set up your financing. Apparently there was some confusion or miscommunication about the matter. We apologize and hope we can help make it better for you in the future. Thank you.'}<//response>

<username>Angela Cole< /username><Text>Sales persons James and Abdul will mislead and give you wrong information in regards to your purchase. I was told they spoke to my bank and my first payment for new loan will be in 60 days when in actuality all the correct was in CUDL and my credit union actually offered 90 days. My credit union was still offering me 90 days deferred payment if Go Hyundai will change the sales contract to reflect the new payment due date. I spoke to both sales person and Abdul told me because my credit union paid Go Hyundai for the loan , Go Hyundai is unable to rewrite the sales contract, and that he spoke to someone in underwriting at my bank and the individual told him they will change the date in house. That turned out to be a lie, unless the sales contract is changed the bank has to go with what's on the sales contract. When i called on the phone, i was met with very unprofessional/rude attitude.
I will never purchase anything from GoHyundai Stockton CA, never!< /Text>< Time>

My engine and transmission was destroyed after I hit something on the freeway. Tim did everything to make sure everything was ordered and fixed. He also went above and beyond going back and forth with my insurance company to make sure everything was covered. He also called me and kept me up to date. He was so amazing! I would highly recommend Stockton Hyundai.<//review>

Had a wonderful experience with Rosindo, Xavier, and Eddy!! Fantastic service and attention, work was done expediently by a tech, and Covid safety precautions were taken by everyone and throughout the process. Plan to return to this dealership next time I need work done! Thank you for making it such a pleasant experience, Hyundai Team!!<//Text>

<review>Stockton Hyundai was understanding and flexible. Originally I called them ahead of time to get a quote on the vehicle I wanted. When I arrived there were some hidden costs due to Stargard, which cannot be removed. However, they acted quickly and professionally to keep the price in line with their quote. In the end, I left the happy owner of a 2020 Veloster. Ask to work with Samajaye, he was the man with the plan. The manager was also top notch. Would recommend.</review><GmapID>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba< /GmapID><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

Got a very fair price for the high demand vehicle we searched for in the Bay Area. Their internet service was fast and efficient. The sales crew worked together to provide pictures as I was over 70 miles from the dealer. Unfortunately that’s the best of the best. When I picked up my vehicle it was not as detailed as accustomed. The interior still had plastic coverings in many places which my son was happy to remove, and the rear window was never cleaned on the inside resulting in really bad glare. There was also a very small but deep paint ding on the rear gate. I was promised that it would be addressed but 2 months later? Crickets!! I’ve had service at a closer dealer and they have been better so I will just get a little touch up pain and try myself.<//Text>

<review>Stockton Hyundai Is one of the most impressive car dealerships I know.
Whether it’s sales or service they are the best.
I love Hyundai of Stockton because they’ve looked out for me for six years. They are kind, patient, considerate and caring. I’m happy with my service. I would recommend Stockton Hyundai to all my family and friends. And to anyone who is looking for a great car. And a great team to keep it running without outstanding service.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I had no intentions of buying a vehicle as I was just looking. Alejandra Estrada was the first person to approach me letting me know she was available to assist with any questions. She wasn’t pushy towards getting me to buy anything. On the contrary she was extremely helpful and patient with us! No questions were left unanswered. Extremely happy with my over all experience! Thank you Alejandra!<//review>

<text>Went in with a pre- approval that dealt with really less than perfect credit history - so going in, I didn't think i was going to be leaving with a vehicle.

Greeted by a friendly and awesome guy by the name of Stephen Inthirath.  I talked to him about my credit history and then my current positive finances.  He took the time and went through the ringer to make sure I was able to be approved for a vehicle.  He made the entire experience a positive and uplifting one.  Highly recommend Stephen as your go-to sales guy.

<Review>Took in for recall repairs and to get my key fob to work and they advised me that my battery needed replacement - did so - then 4 days later battery light comes on and car loses all electrical power then they won’t warrant their repair or diagnostic to confirm it’s a different issue and because I was in Sac they wouldn’t cover towing or extend reimbursement of the diagnostic at the Sac store until it’s confirmed a different issue - completely left me without a car and having to wait now till next week to find out what’s wrong with my car annnnd I have to pay for the diagnostic regardless if the repair is under warranty or not!!

Such a great experience. We made an appointment and had a full maintenance service including a transmission flush, coolant flush, and an oil change. Tim was pleasant, as he greeted me by name as soon as I got out to walk in. They finished my service in under 3 hours, I was very impressed, as we anticipated it would take longer. They had a full staff and made the experience easy from start to finish. I always enjoy going to Stockton Hyundai. They are always pleasant and eager to help. Outstanding customer service! Every time!< /text>

I would not recommend this dealership for service. Had motor replaced because of a recall and within days several things began to break down. AC  stopped working , Hose clamp was found lose from engine, fuel began to leak from motor...@repair cost over $700.  what's next? Took it elsewhere and found things were put together incorrectly. Have had to tow car 3 times! The Service manager is incompetent, rude, disrespectful and will try to suck every penny out of you.  Go to a different Dealership< /review>

<Text>Hugo was really helpful in finding the vehicle that was perfect for me. They have the best prices out of any Hyundai store I’ve been in and are super friendly and no pressure. Highly recommend this store.< /Text>< name>

Edgar was very attentive to me from the time I walked in, until I left..
Was told my car repair would take one hour, and my car was ready on time. I was impressed when it was ready. Hopefully when I return next week for new parts to be installed, this will happen again.
Thanks Mike< /Text>

<Review>I wish I could give 0 stars. The management is horrible, which explains why the service is the WORST service I have ever received at a Hyundai dealership. I am still waiting for a return call from the manager and its been a month. I even left a request with the finance manager, which should have given my second request priority, which it didn't.  I have purchased Hyundai in 3 states, CA, OK and AL, this was the worst experience EVER.  I will NEVER patronize Stockton Hyundai again.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Had an easy, great experience at Stockton Hyundai. Carlos M. was awesome,  kinda guy I enjoy buying a car from. Not pushy, but helpful. And sincere. actually a few sales guys made sure I was doing ok while I was still deciding. But not in an aggressive way.. they just wanted to make sure all was good. Happy with my choice in car and dealership. will drive out to Stockton for service on the car just to work with them.</Review>

Exceptional and friendly dealership and a great place to buy your Hyundai. The inventory is great and the sales team is very responsive and provides great help in selecting and deciding on your auto purchase. This would be the place to go especially if you live in Northern California. Hyundai have an amazing portfolio of autos to meet ever need.  All beautifully designed.< /text>

<text>I really truly enjoyed the service there. I was even told about other stuff that I could have done with my vehicle so It can run better. I had a flush done on my car. Actually it runs a lot better smoother. And they gave me a list of things that also can be done whenever I have the time to take it in. It’s good to know about your vehicle at least for me. I’m not someone that can just go buy a new car. So the car I have now means a lot to me I want it  to last me quite a while. So thank you for your service.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Took my Santa Fe in for a oil change and an issue I was having with the sound on my car. All sound stopped working on the radio and GPS. The rep I was working with,  Xavier was able to figure out the problem super quickly. I guess the computer system in my car glitched and all he had to do was reset it. He also showed me how to do it myself in case it ever happens again. Been going here for over a year. The service is always super quick and within my budget. They do a multi point inspection to make sure my car is running great and have always been able to tell me well in advance in something needs to be done to my car like tires going bad or needing a transmission flush in enough advance I was able to save for it. I won’t go anywhere else.</text>

I was very impressed with Stockton Hyundai! Carl was wonderful to us from the time we called to see if the lot had the car we wanted. My son an I drove to Stockton we are from San Jose. The car I had requested was sitting in front washed and waiting for me to see. I got a great deal they priced matched with a Hyundai dealership. I purchased my new Kona Ultimate and was very satisfied. The financial manager was very informative.as well I would recommend going to this dealership if you are purchasing a new vehicle.

He was very professional and was able to make a great deal with me which made me want to come to Stockton hyundai. Chris was my salesman assigned to me and he was very professional and also very personable when speaking with me. I felt I was able to connect with both of them not just on a business level. The whole Staff was super friendly to my family and I and I was super happy overall. I would recommend Stockton Hyundai when purchasing a car. They are honest and I want their customers to leave feeling happy and that their purchase was worth it.<//Text><username>Andrea Roldan< /username><time>1591116033150< /time>< response>

<text>I've had positive customer service from Eddie, Xavier and Tim who are great at the service counter.  The mechanic tech Baba has been great thus far at finding the correct issues with my car.
However, the prices are above my budget being a single mom. It would be AWESOME if they had some type of payment plan. Nonetheless I give Stockton Hyundai four stars instead of five, due to the high prices.</text><rating>4< /rating><resp>None< /resp><Pics>None< /Pics><gmap_id>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba<//gmap_id><UserId.>100167367600763205076< /UserId.>< user_name>

Tim the advisor for my service that day was excellent. I had some instructions listen on the form regarding the type of oil that was used. Not their fault because my husband gave them the authorization to use regular oil instead of the synthetic oil in my instructions. Tim said that he would honor the coupon for $39.99 for synthetic the next time I got an oil change. Thanks Tim!< /review>

I had an appointment for them to check three things in my car. Oil change, AC and sunroof visor. They did the oil change, they said my AC was OK so I’m hoping it is because it hasn’t been blowing the greatest cold air and they wouldn’t fix my sunroof visor because they said they needed more time.< /text>

Kudos to Chris and Brian for their excellent communication and customer service.
Fair pricing and no-pressure buying process made this one of the most pain free new car purchases in a long time.
I highly recommend Stockton Hyundai.<//text>

Stockton Hyundai Service Department provides a positive and caring experience. Today was no exception.  I was greeted warmly with a smile and was checked in promptly.

They are very professional in answering any questions you may have as well as resolving any issues that are going on with your vehicle.  It is truly a pleasure bringing my car here.

<Review>I love my new 2020 Hyundai Accent from Stockton Hyundai! This was an excellent experience for my first online vehicle purchase. Sales Manager Jason Suen went above and beyond to take care of my needs. I found that he and the other sales reps with whom I interacted at Stockton Hyundai all have exemplary communication skills, and their follow-through was timely, thorough, and professional. These were critical factors in my decision to do business with Stockton Hyundai. -- Suzanne B<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I have nothing but love for Stockton Hyundai. They have helped me and treated me and my husband with kindness. They have gone the extra mile and fixed my car several times all under warranty. I didn't have the best experience with service in the bay area where my husband and I first bought our cars. Except for this one service guy name Jerry he was so kind and remembered mine and my husband name. However, Stockton Hyundai restored my faith and will always take our cars to them. Grateful and thankful for their kindness and exceptional service.<//Text>

I visited 7 different dealerships before choosing Stockton Hyundai. I wanted to test drive the smaller SUV at each before making my decision. I went to Toyota, Chevrolet, Mazda, Subaru, Kia, and Ford, tried them all, and finally made it to Stockton Hyundai where I fell in love with my new Hyundai Tucson. I’ve had it for a week now and couldn’t be more excited about it. I got the ultimate trim package and it has so many awesome features that I love like the heated and cooled leather seats, sun/moon roof that opens all the way to the back seat, safety features like gently guiding me back to the center of the lane if I get too close to the line, letting me know when there’s a car next to me so I don’t change lanes yet, an amazing sound system, and so many others.

And if that weren’t enough, I also found Stephen Inthirath. He was the icing on the cake. I had already met six other car salesmen and was not pleased with any of them to say the least. Steve was so awesome, he made me feel so comfortable as I checked out the SUV. He explained the features and listened as I explained what was important to me in a vehicle. He even contacted me the next day to check if I had any additional questions and help me set up starguard and blue link on the SUV. I know if I need anything else I can always contact him and he will respond. I cannot say enough about the exceptional service he provided and continues to provide. I highly recommend Steve Inthirath and Stockton Hyundai and will certainly come back for purchases in the future! Thanks Steve!</review>

I found Stockton Hyundai by accident.  I was on my way home from a visit in New Mexico when I stopped in Lodi to see my sister.  My van would not start when I went to leave.  I took it to Stockton Hyundai and they found the problem and fixed it the first time.  I had it in other dealerships and they did not find the problems. I have had my Entourage in several times over the last couple of years for repairs and have been extremely pleased with the service, expertise of the employees, and the courteous staff.  The Service Department is exceptional!< /Text>

What a fabulous experience! Jason and Stephen took great care of me.
Jason even went out of the way to drop off a part at my house that needed to be ordered.
If you are looking for a great car buying experience, Stockton Hyundai is the place.<//Review>

It was my first time buying a car and I came in with my dad. As soon as we parked Chris came out to greet us and assist us. He was very professional and friendly and helped us with what we were looking for. He spent a lot of time with us which we really appreciated. He is an amazing honest employee and covered over everything and helped us with pricing and all! He really worked with us and made sure we were comfortable and that I was happy with my choice. We appreciate everything he did and the Hyundai Stockton dealership is a great place to look. It was a wonderful experience. I really recommend Chris and Hyundai Stockton.</text>

<review>I went in for a recall software update and an oil change. As I was pulling away I noticed a check engine light so I went back. After looking at it again they said there was an 800 dollar issue that would need to be fixed and it would take weeks for the part to arrive.</review>< pics>

<text>I've bought numerous cars in my life and I always go in defensive and informed. I do my research and know the price I want to pay because without fail, the dealership will try to squeeze every last penny out of me or I spend hours at the dealership haggling over price. It's stressful and exhausting.

Stockton Hyundai was unlike any car buying experience I have ever had.

Without a doubt, this was the smoothest, most stress-free car purchase I have ever made. I was able to negotiate a great deal via text message, fill out all my financing information online, and got a good deal on my trade-in, all without ever leaving my house! When I showed up at the dealership, there were no bait & switch or up-sell tactics... Everything we agreed to was set up and ready to go. I just filled out all the paperwork, got a walkthrough of my new vehicle and I was on my way. Amazing!

I drove 45 minutes from Sacramento for the vehicle, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. The photo they took of me smiling from ear to ear in front of my new Palisade Limited was truly from the friendly and hassle-free purchase (The SUV is pretty cool too!).

Thanks guys!</text></record>

My experience with Stockton Hyundai was AWESOME! I will say that it didn't start that way. I had an appointment to look at a particular vehicle. When I arrived, the vehicle was not there. It was being showcased at an event. I was a little upset about it because one, no one told me. Two, I dragged my family out while it was cold and rainy. The representative, Mario, with whom I was working with offered to take me on a test drive in the same model, just a different color package. I think he could sense I was getting ready to leave. Well, the model I test drove is the model my family liked more! Stockton Hyundai, thank you for being an awesome team, no pressuring and aware of your customers. Aside from the amazing vehicle line up, Stockton Hyundai is where you should be buying your next car!</Review>

Working with Stockton Hyundai was probably the most smoothest car purchasing experience I've ever had. I saw the car I was interested in and sent an email for more info. Some back and forths throughout the day and drove 2 hours to pick-up the car that evening. Mind you this was while I was at work =). Jackie, Karina, and Brian were awesome to work with and made my experience just that much smoother. If you make a purchase at this dealer, be sure to try and work with these folks.< /text>

I went to Stockton to visit my Dad on the way there my A/C stopped working, I called Hyundai on Hammer lane they made an appointment for me the next morning. I spoke to Tim when I arrived he was very friendly and courteous. I told him the problem he informed me there had been 2 recalls on my A/C I wasn’t aware of, he checked the address on file we found out it was an old address so he corrected it. After inspecting my A/C Tim called me said my vehicle was ready but he would have to order the recall parts would I still be in town, I told him I would not. When I went to pick up my car Tim had prepared my invoice and included the part numbers I needed to get those repairs when I got home. I was able to Order the parts and schedule my appointment over the phone to take my car in when I get home. Great experience! The only thing that could have made it better is if the parts had been in stock.< /text>

I was impressed with the service at Stockton Hyundai sales dept. Sal Onate helped me and he was awesome! He was really helpful and patient while I tried to figure out what I wanted. He even stayed late to show me how to use a bunch of the features on my new 2019 Hyundai Sonata sport.  I love my new car! Thanks Sal & the sales team at Stockton Hyundai!<//Text>

<text>I walked in thinking that there was no way I would leave with a car. A little  over  2 hours later I drove off in a 2018 Elantra. The most welcoming car dealership I've ever been. No pressure, willing to work with all different credit types. I totally recommend Stockton Hyundai if you're looking to buy a new  or newer vehicle.<//text>< pictures>

Approximately, a week ago I
took my car for maintenance check, I was greeted by a young man, who informed me, what was to be done. After about and hour, I was told that the car was ready. I thank them,  this time around, was no recall.  Since I have been taking the car for maintenance, it appears that each and every time, was a recall on the car.</review>

<review>I pride myself with being a diligent and savvy car buyer after purchasing more than 100 cars in my short life.  I contacted Stockton Hyundai regarding a simple all cash purchase for an advertised car and received nothing but run arounds.  I don't know if it was because they did not have the car or what but I could not get a sales rep or sales manager to sell me a car!  First, it is important to mention in all fairness that this was a remote purchase being conducted, but given Covid-19, remote purchases are more common place and they should have been prepared.  every person I spoke to continued to tell me to fill out an application for a cash purchase... I protested there was no need but they insisted. I said if you need my personal information for the transfer documents , I will provide that information but I will not consent to a credit check nor will I provide my income information as it is irrelevant for this transaction.  I submitted the form and immediately called back to confirm receipt and that they would not pull my credit report but after 4 days of unreturned phone calls, I attempted to reach the General Manager, Joey Gonzalez and I am starting to believe this man does not exist because no one would take a real message, he has no voicemail, I asked for an email address and could not receive one.  This is the only Hyundai dealer in the area my niece lives so I wanted to do business with them but they were truly horrible to deal with from the sales person to non-existent GM.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Great selection of cars. Amazing deals and discounts throughout. Excellent customer service. Was greeted by a very nice gentleman that directed me to Carlos Marin who was my sales representative. Carlos went above and beyond with his customer service. He answered all my questions (very knowledgeable) and was never pushy when it came to selling and me taking time making my final decision. He even helped with returning my rental car so I could drive off in my new car! Would definitely recommend it and will do business here again!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was looking around for the right car to buy, and did my homework and landed on the Palisade or the Telluride. These cars are hard to find!

I just called Stockton Hyundai after finding they had the right model Palisade in stock and talked w/ Carlos.  I was dreading having to drive 1 hour and potentially having it be a bait and switch or even sold before I arrived.

But Carlos did what I asked over text, send me a pic of the car and the window sticker, and said he would save it for me, and even promised a price over the phone.

And guess what?  I arrived, met Carlos.  He's a friendly, cool dude.  I went for a test drive, was sold on it, and then said I'd like to buy it.  No back and forth, just bought it w/ the price promised.  There was an offer of extra warranty and stuff, which I didn't want (Hyundai offers a great warranty out of the box).

Everything with financing went fast as well, signed papers quickly and I was out of there with a pleasant experience.  Thank you to Carlos (sales) and Abdul in finance.   Would recommend if you're out there in the Stockton area!< /Review>

<user>102467639828928210577</user>< Review>
Had various experiences from other dealerships but from all Stockton Hyundai was the best. I believe it was the representative that makes or brakes a deal within a dealership and Brian Blakley provided the best experience. He provided details of the car that suited my needs and he went above and beyond to get the most without breaking the bank too much. He WAS NOT pushy like other representatives and was not distant because “you may not buy a car”. If you ever need advice on a car or need to get a general idea of where to start, here with him would be a great start, with no hard feelings. I left to look at other options but came back because the car was great but the service was even better. I am a first generation college student and I got my first car (a Hyundai Tucson sport)!! Many thanks to Brian!!! May you get upgraded or a bonus, bless your heart.<//Review>

<review>I had a wonderful experience at Stockton Hyundai! Jason, Austin, and Phillip were all wonderful and made my car buying experience a joy. They’re not pushy like so many other car dealers and want what’s best for their customer and will work hard to make you happy. I highly recommend them for your next car buying experience.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Well, it was my first time their and every thing went well better than I thought .I was greeted and was given  options as far as having work done to  my vehicle and how do I want to wait for my   Vehicle to be done the options were do I want a rental car for the day or would I like  a discount on the bill once it’s complete  and of course I took the discount because I wasn’t going anywhere for that day also they sent a ride to pick me up when my vehicle is done.  I never had any dealership give me options like that  they would give me a ride home but no discount  or even offer me a car for that day without my car being kept overnight  I found that to be very helpful for me .< /Text>

Salesman (Sal) was very friendly and patient throughout entire process. We looked at several SUV’s and discussed several options. I am totally satisfied with my new SUV. The other staff is extremely friendly. Getting the paperwork processed was smooth and easy. Great place to buy your next new car.

Customer service,  service center was very considerate of my time and got right to the job. Christopher and Catrina were very nice allowing me to test drive a couple of new models. This helped me make a final decision as to what my next car is going to be. Absolutely sure I won't be buying a Palisades.</Review>

<Review>I bring my car to Stockton Hyundai because the staff is very personable and cheerful.  And because they never overcharge me or try to sell me parts or service that I don't need.  As I told Xavier today, when I decide to purchase a newer car, I will seriously consider buying a Hyundai because I am so pleased with the service department.<//Review>< gmapID>

Bought our 1st car here but this was our 6th Hyundai overall. Working with the team and James Garvin was painless and very easy. Probably one of the better car buying experiences that I have done.< /Review>

Hugo and Stephen helped me and my buddy tremendously by looking after us shopping for a performance vehicle. Beyond that, upon walking in, it was clear this team was organized and worked well together. We didn't walk out with a new car today since we have more research and shopping to do, but I will definitely be coming back to Stockton Hyundai if I buy a Hyundai and recommending this dealer to my friends and family.< /Text>

What a great experience purchasing from Stockton Hyundai!! With just the intent on doing some “car shopping” I ended up leaving as a VERY satisfied customer! My sales rep Brittany was AMAZING!! She went above and beyond! She was very patient and explained every option that was available to me. I can’t rave enough on how smooth the process was. Thank you again Stockton Hyundai!!< /text>

<review>Appointment was right on time. Oil change and some maintenance. Advised of some additional maintenance needed, which was over my budget, but not pressured to do now. All staff I dealt with were courteous.do wish they would do car wash or at least give coupon to a car wash. Even if it is exterior wash only.<//review>< user_id>

I went to stockton hyundai with my wife and mother in law. We were there to buy a car for my wife, my mother in law ending up buying one to because of the way our sales guy chris precaiado treated us. He did his best to give is a good deal. He did. Sale guy chris even clean the cars himself. I have never seen that before and I liked it. He took a step above the bar. It is our first hyundai we ever bought  and best experience of buying a car we ever had. Thank u chris for wonderful service at hyundai of stockton. Antonio camarillo<//Text>

The service attendant left me waiting outside for 20 minutes And I had to text him to remind him that nothing was happening.

Then he finally texted me back  20. Minutes later

The car was taken back to the garage to change the oil and rotate the tires

During the same conversation I asked him if he could vacuum out the inside and it never happened.

Probably not gonna come back</text>

Awful service.
My window is not working so I requested diagnostic. My window position was up but they made it down and let it down position
I asked them to make it up but they told me I should pay more labor fee and it is not their responsibility although they got 160.
They got my money and ruined my car
So bad experience< /text>

Great customer service here. The service advisor and technicians were very friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you!

*I recently bought a vehicle from here as well. The service center and Farshad have been so great to me I decided to give sales a try. I'm glad I did. I worked with Stephen and he got me into the car I wanted and I walked out the door feeling comfortable in my purchase. There was no pressure or any crazy sales tactics. He was very professional and friendly. He even made sure my daughter was occupied and happy since I had to bring her with me. The finance team worked with my budget and my needs. They sold me a great used vehicle that is in beautiful condition and I didn't wake up this morning regretting the deal or worrying I went in over my head. Very relaxed, family environment here. The sales team in general is so customer service oriented and it shows. I chatted with people I wasn't even working with and even got the names of some great restaurants in the area as well since I just moved here. Small things like friendly conversation can make your experience so much easier to deal with. This is where you want to service your vehicle or purchase a vehicle!! Top notch customer service and it is very sincere! Thank you all so much for helping me out! :)</Text>

I would recommend Stockton Hyndai and my son (who is an auto mechanic) says you cant go wrong with a Hyundai- well built cars, dependable and the best warranties!</Text>< Pics>

After shopping around at different dealerships at different cities the day before, my wife and I came across an internet add at Stockton Hyundai. We went inside and was surprised how busy it was on 4th of July. While looking inside one of the cars on the showroom floor this gentleman who obviously was very busy running around helping other clients stopped in the middle of his sprint to ask if we've been helped. Christopher Preciado helped us from begging to the end. Very professional and easy to work with. Working with Christopher did not feel like I was haggling back and forth, more like he was working for us to get the numbers we wanted. Bottom line with Christopher, this buying experience which usually is a chore and a headache became one of our easiest experience ever. With that busy and half staffed day, he even personally washed and filled the gas tank up himself. Thanks for the wonderful experience Mr. Preciado!< /review>

<Text>Purchased a 2019 Santa Fe in July, went to our first service in September. Very pleasant purchasing experience with sales, but very poor experience with service department. Drove grime Sacramento to Stockton believing we should establish some “loyalty” with dealership. Best I can explain is, service experience reminded us that we have plenty of alternative Hyundai dealerships to service with and even closer.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Our sales associate was quite helpful and informative. He took the time to address all of our questions regarding the car that we chose. Because we started our loan paperwork so late in the evening we had to return the next evening to wrap things up. To our surprise the Sales Manager was able to get us a better loan with a lower interest rate and a lower monthly payment thereby saving us a fair amount over the term of the loan. Thanks to the Hyundai staff.< /Review>

Great customer service, and an overall wonderful experience, which is why we are repeat customers. They do not pressure you and respect your requests and choices. This time around they didn’t have the exact car and features I wanted on their lot but they located one for me and sent a driver to go pick it up for me. I had my new car the same day. I’m very happy with their service and highly recommend Stockton Hyundai. Stephen was a pleasure to work with.< /text>

<Text>Not satisfied with the salesman I had, everything was fine the day I purchased my vehicle. I'm finding out he told me many untruths. I found out two weeks ago my vehicle that I ask him twice if it was certified he said yes I did not know that I should have been given paper work saying certified this was the first time in my life that I purchased a pre owned vehicle. Now he avoids my phone calls.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba<//gmapID></record>

Before I arrived at Stockton Hyundai, I had been led to believe that the man I was meeting was the he sales manager. This was not the case. I did meet Brian instead. Brian was very accommodating but had to go back and forth to the real sales manager for Q and A.< /review>

Had the most disappointing interview today,not only did the young man accuse me of selling  cars illegally. But he conducted the most unprofessional interview I’ve ever been too. He didn’t look at my resume before hand to see not only did i move from a different state but also that the sales regulations are completely different then California. He was also rude&disrespectful. So the whole entire interview he kept accusing me, with out fully looking at my resume. Luckily i was able to report this to corporate before legal action was involved. Hopefully they pull through on there end because i will sue the for being racist during an interview.< /Text>

I brought in  my 2019 Ioniq for its first servicing. The appointment was on time and the job was finished in the time they estimated. I’m happy

This is another review for yet another servicing. One again, Stockton Hyundai did a great job. The appointment was on time and they did I shed on time. I always take my car to Stockton even though I live in Sacramento.</text>

My service writer Xzavier was fantastic. I had three items fix and only one item was fix correctly. Xzavier did let it be known that we had a additional year in case it was not fix correcty. I will have to take back my car to the service dept to get the two items look at again. NO fault of his as he is just the service writer.<//text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>My car broke down in the middle of the freeway. I would’ve taking my car to a trusted repair shop in Modesto because I only thought it was going to be a minor issue that would only cost around $500-$600. But that would’ve cost me an additional $200 so at Geico’s recommendation I had a repair shop to take it to nearby that doesn’t work on motors or engines or the dealership. Having no clue or even an inclination that my car had something wrong with it I just went ahead and sent it to the dealer thinking I was going to pay an additional cost just for it being at the dealership. It was getting later in the day and I had only heard from Tim at 8 AM the next morning so I started looking for rental cars since my insurance only covers rentals in the event of an accident. Around 3 PM I got a callback from Tim telling me that my engine had completely blown and never in his years of working on cars had ever seen an engine explode the way it did and damage the rest of the car like it did. I immediately felt all my savings and money fall right through my pocket. But then he told me he had some good news and said that he spoke with the dealership and Hyundai and told them the way the car was damaged should’ve never happened even with normal wear and tear.

Hyundai agreed to recall my engine, warranty out my engine, and cover the cost of all parts and labor.
They also strongly recommended to replace belts and hoses connected to the engine and were nearing replacement anyways and would cover the cost of labor on that as well. But I would have to pay $500 for much needed maintenance.They also agreed to give me a loaner car while all repairs and maintenance are being done free of charge and until my car was ready to be picked up in a couple weeks.

I was so happy with the customer service I got from Tim, their front desk people, and how open and honest Tim was. Please give Tim some sort of reward/promotion/raise. He was open, honest, and very straight with me - most, if not, all privately owned shops would’ve never gone to the extent Tim and Hyundai did. Thank you everyone!<//text><rate>5<//rate></record>

<review>I met with Carlos Marin at Stockton Hyundai to buy my new 2019 Santa Fe and had an amazing experience. He is a wonderful salesman and kept his word on our agreed upon price without being pushy or trying to get me to purchase upgrades or anything I didn’t want or need. He took his time to completely explain all the paperwork, we signed everything needed, yet was respectful of my time and we finished rather quickly! He also walked me through all the details of how my new vehicle worked before I drove off the lot. I’d highly recommend Carlos and Stockton Hyundai to anyone in the market for a new Santa Fe!

Service was excellent,  my only issue was they didn't wash the car. When I had my vehicle serviced at the dealership where I purchased it in Arizona,  they detailed it always. Even if I just swung by to say hi, they took the car and detailed it just for great customer service. Maybe I was just spoiled by them, but it would be nice to have that in Stockton after service. I  will continue to go to Stockton Hyundai though.< /text>

In and out in 25 minutes for an oil change!
Very nice waiting room to pass the time.

Back again today (12/11/19). Had an appointment. After 20 minutes of my car still sitting in the parking lot, I inquired, after which it was promptly moved to the work area. I was told my wait time would be 45 minutes. I was there one hour and 35 minutes.<//Review>

Now this is only based on service and test drives no contacts where written. We all know it's work but they really do have a great attitude . Busy dealership yet low key . Nobody bothered me while I looked at the vehicles and then once I asked they were more than happy to help and got on the ball . My vehicle was serviced in the time that they stated.< /text>

<review>I have yet to have a negative experience with Stockton Hyundai. From the purchase to the service, I have been happy. Xavier is the service representative I usually see and he is the best! I tried to hack the survey to give more than 5 stars but it wouldn't let me.< /review>< pictures>

<text>This was our third purchase of a Hyundai since 2018 all from different dealerships and Stockton Hyundai was by far the best in customer service not that the others were bad. We also received a great deal on our Tucson SEL AWD! Another bonus is that my insurance went down even with max coverage due to the safety of their vehicles, per my insurance agency. So in all I would highly recommend Stockton Hyundai and that’s coming from a former Toyota customer for the past 20 plus years. Thanks Phil and Stephen!</text>< Name>

< Review>
We came at this place as we thought it’s a big showroom, so expecting a good deal. But unfortunately the attending assistant manager was so rude. We are completely unhappy with their service. Though they have a big showroom but they don’t even know how to attend a customer.

(Edited)
And yes declining our offer is not our disrespect, we are totally agree with you. But when we had given our offer , the attending person said “no , thank you, not a penny less” , and suddenly get up and walk away. Isn’t this disrespect? He even don’t try to stop us and not even try to convince us for some other vehicle or anything. It seems like he is in so hurry . And then we left from there, this is actually what happens there.

We feel so insulted that we do not even ask for $50 test drive coupon. Thank you.< /Review>

At $18,255 on a BRAND NEW Kona we feel we have the best price in the market so to reduce this does not make sense for us to do. We have the Kona you are looking for and a price that is better than anyone else! We are still happy to help you, but if we decline your offer its just a business decision not a personal one. We can still be friends :)'}<//Resp><GmapID>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba<//GmapID></record>

Best all around experience at a car lot. Chris Preciado helped me find a car. He is an excellent sales man. He listened to what I was looking for.. was able to answer all my questions, worked out a comfortable affordable deal for me and he has a great attitude! He’s one of the best! I ended up purchasing a Hyundai Kona.. I LOVE my new car..<//Text>

<text>Now this is only based on service and test drives no contacts where written. We all know it's work but they really do have a great attitude . Busy dealership yet low key . Nobody bothered me while I looked at the vehicles and then once I asked they were more than happy to help and got on the ball . My vehicle was serviced in the time that they stated.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Went in looking to purchase an Suv and walked out with a 2020 Hyundai Tuscon. The person who helped me was really considerate of my needs and guided me through the process. So far Im happy with my purchase.
Just adding to the review, I'm completely happy and satisfied with my purchase as well as how simple and hassle free it was for the maintenance. I would recommend this dealership.<//Text><rating>5< /rating><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

Staff was very helpful, not your typical down your throat car salesmen trying to get you into a car right this second. Friendly and understanding. Christopher Preciado was my salesman, who made us feel comfortable and got me into the perfect car with the price for my needs. Thank you<//text>

< Review>
I did a lot of research when buying my first electric car. I tried many dealerships, but got a lot of deception and disappointment. Stockton Hyundai was the only dealership that made me the deal I wanted with a hassle free experience. Chris Preciado did an excellent job of getting me where I needed to be as far as MSRP, APR, and monthly payment without hours of haggling. I couldn’t be happier with the end result!</Review>

<review>I waited for about 40 minutes for the shuttle only to find that I was the lone passenger and during that waiting time, I had seen the driver walk around the lounge multiple times and there was no attempt to alert me that the shuttle was ready. I seemed to have "slipped through the cracks" since only when I followed up with the service adviser that the shuttle was driven up the customer lounge.

The problem with my car was resolved more quickly than the time frame promised though I had no appointment and at no cost. Would have been nice to have had a complimentary carwash.< /review><Response>None<//Response>< Pictures>

<Text>I have purchased 2 new Hyundai vehicles over the last 3 years. I have had all my services and recall checks performed at Stockton Hyundai. They have always done great work and fortunately I have not needed anything else besides the routine services and recall checks. I keep coming back because of the friendly and helpful service staff, especially Xavier! They always try to get work done to meet your schedule and let you know about special pricing coupons.<//Text><date>1555269415219< /date><gmapID>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba<//gmapID>< Name>

<Text>Tim was my helper, he was solo today. Despite
how busy he was, he was polite, courteous, and friendly.  I left my coupon at home and he still honored it. I was very thankful. And the wait time was not too long. Thank you Tim for an awesome day.</Text>< time>

Hugo did a great job as all of the people we dealt with yesterday! We appreciate Hugo’s warmth and dedication in finding the perfect Hyundai to suit our needs! This our third Hyundai in our 52 years of marriage and we love these cars.
(We wondered why we would not qualify for the LOYALTY rebate since we bought our first Hyundai in 2006, added second one in 2009, and finally this year. That did not seem exactly right to us.)

Thank  you Hugo for helping us through to the desired conclusion.

< Review>
(1st time) We had a 10:45 am appointment and I got there on time. I waited in the waiting area, and at 11:45 am, the car had not been moved. So I went to ask why they hadn’t worked on it yet (they said it was lunch time), but they finally moved it in the dock and it finally finished 45 minutes later at 12:30.
All my other visits went well. However, this visit Xavier Betts was not there to check me in and make sure things went smooth.

(2nd time and 11/2020 post). We went again this week and Xavier was there. All went very well.<//Review>

< Review>
We bought an Elantra car during the weekend and when we got home we realized one of the keys was not cut. We called them and they told me to bring the key back to get it fixed. So that’s what I did. Later someone from Hyundai called me saying my key was cut and I only needed to bring my car to reprogram my key. They scheduled an appointment to go on Friday at 4pm. When I checked in he told me they were short on technicians and he could reschedule it. I said no way. So he received my car and keys and said he was going to do his best. Later he came to tell me that my key never got cut and we had to schedule it for next week. So next week is going to be the third time I go back to Stockton Hyundai to get my second key cut and reprogrammed. Their entire staff needs to do a better job at communicating.</Review>

All the staff here was great, friendly & helpful.  Purchased a new Veloster & Chis (my sales guy) was knowledgeable & helped streamline the purchase process.  Joe in finance was able to work the numbers to make the deal go through.  I'm glad that I chose this dealership to work with.<//Review>

These guys rock!  30 minutes to do an oil change. And the guy in front of me thought he needed brakes. Nope, they just cleaned them, checked them and said his brakes were fine. Now that’s service!<//Review>

Had my car towed in to the dealership after my wife had hit some debris on the freeway. The check engine light was on and the ambient air sensor was flashing. The techs inspected and said there was front end damage with the rock guard pierced. They quoted a price for the work. I called the advisor back and left a message that i would just replace the air gemp sensor. Didnt hear anyfhing from ghe advisor so called him back three hours later to confirm he got the message his reply " what message" so cofered with him. He tells me they dont hsve the sensor and will have to order it and should have it by tuesday five days later. Tuesday come i call around noon to see if they have the part, they tell me it should be there in the afternoon. I call wednesday afternoon and they tell me the part is in but the harness had not come in. No one said anything about a harness, car wont be ready until possibly friday. Full week without wheels and no offer to provide rental car. Not impressed<//Text>

Warning! This place has a service department that lies and commits fraud. We can speak on our behalf. Ken and Tim both told us, a certain repair wasn't covered by the ext warranty and convinced us to pay out of pocket. Yet when we called the ext warranty, we were informed that the they never declined the repair and that the service manager never got back to them. And the warranty company also mentioned that the service dept seemed to bill them for things that weren't performed, as well as for a rental car, that we didn't have. We went to the GM Joey Gonzales and instead of he being outraged at his staff's lies and fraud. He instead seemed bothered that we went to him. And his rolled his eyes like a child and exhibited an attitude, rather then a professional manager. He kept diverting from the principal topic, that his manager and staff lied and submitting fraud.

When I asked him for his superiors contact information, he refused and then lied also by giving me the wrong information. He stated his superiors is an investor and corporation of "5th wheel corp". I researched and and nothing popped up.

That entire dealership service department and management should be  replaced.</text>

My wife and I visited three different Hyundai dealers. The first in my home town Tracy and they couldn’t get their act together on pricing.  The second one in Dublin, the salesman didn’t want to listen to want I wanted and proceeded to tell me what I wanted. When we arrived to Stockton Hyundai we were greeted by Brian Blakley and we were so impressed. He took us to exactly what we were looking for and took his time to explain every detail of the car we were looking at. The entire staff was amazing through the whole process and we were also really impressed with Carlos, he checked on us a couple times while we were waiting  for the paperwork. Thank you Brian Blakley !!! When we are ready for another car we will be back to see you.</Review>

I appreciate the promptness in which my vehicle was serviced.
However, this was the first time that I take in a new car for first time service where I didn”t get a courtesy wash.
When I called  to reschedule the appointment, the staff member that took the call failed to add the notes I requested from her, even though she said that she did it.</text>

I've been looking for a vehicle for a while now and decided to check Stockton Hyundai for one. Multiple people helped me while I was there, with Karina Morales in particular being very helpful. They made me feel welcome and gave me all the information I needed. I'd recommend a visit if you're searching for a new vehicle.< /Review>

Great service, my family didn't speak or understand English very well but Karina was able to translate for them and helped them find the correct part for his car. I don't know anything about car parts so she was very helpful!!<//Text>

Did a lot of research online shopping for a new car.  The Kona was consistently in the top 5 in small SUV's.  My experience was as expected in buying a new car...takes hours!  My salesman, Mario, was very pleasant and polite, eager to please, but had only been on the job 1 1/2 months.  He was knowledgeable about the vehicle however.  My only concern was that when Philip helped Mario out, he said he could get me $18,500 trade in for my 2016 Ford F-150 with only 10020 miles on it and in 'very good' condition, by "working with the numbers".  This didn't happen and it gives car salesmen a bad name when they make promises they can't keep.  (We shook hands on that amount)  Chris saved the sale by upping the trade in amount on my vehicle.  Had it not been for Philip making a promise he couldn't keep and not explaining 'working the numbers' when I asked, I would have given a higher rating.</review>

I've been shopping around for a Sonata for a few months now but haven't pulled the trigger. When I came around Stockton Hyundai who was having a great deal on a 2015 Sonata Hybrid I figured now was the time. I went down on Saturday and worked some numbers, wasn't satisfied with the deal so I walked.... After re-working the numbers all night I decided to call the dealership back the next morning and tell them the deal I wanted and laid out the numbers. I was told I would get a call back and waited around. Still no call back by Monday, so I called Monday morning and was told I would be called back. When it finally reached the afternoon I decided the only way I would get answers was to physically be in the store. I went to the store and ended up re-working the deal that I worked on Monday. UGH! It felt like no one knew the numbers I had discussed on Saturday. I ended up being able to negotiate a bit more since this was now my second trip to the dealership and I was determined to leave with the car. I ended up walking with the deal that I wanted, but felt that better communication between the dealership staff could have led to a better car buying process. As I'm a loyal Hyundai lover! I would return here to purchase again, but hope that a communication process is in process the next time around.</Text>

<text>Not happy with service. Every time we go in there's either something they forget to do or something is not covered. We wanted to make sure everything was covered so we have a 10 year, 100k powertrain warranty, as well as the bumper to bumper warranty. My Sonata is currently in for service and I'm being told that a 12 volt battery isn't covered because it only had a 3 year warranty. What kind of car is equipped with a 12 volt battery with a 3 year life span, and why is it $285!?! I haven't picked it up yet but I'm hoping someone takes care of this to keep customers happy. I paid $32,000 for this car 4 years ago. We've had constant rattling of the sunroof which has been worked on twice. It's back in for that again. Doors rattled but "fixed" (supposedly) but I just got tired of complaining about that so now we just deal with it. Speakers on our infinity system have been worked on before and it's back in for that again. Sunroof leaks but they said they don't see the problem so I guess we have to deal with a leaky roof in the rain on a car that's still pretty new. Last time it was in for service the techs smeared grease on the roof liner but didn't clean it when we brought it back in for them to do that. Now the dash is blinking DO NOT DRIVE, CHECK CHARGING SYSTEM. But since they don't cover the battery that is supposedly causing the problem, I was given the offer to pick it up and drive off like that. By the way, I am not the only hybrid Sonata owner that has this issue. I searched online for this problem and there are others as well as YouTube videos of it. Should there not have been a recall? If they take care of that battery I'll change my review. The service guy at the counter is great but he can't do everything. I blame the service technicians and the Hyundai corporation for lack of customer care. I was next considering buying an SUV from them because I love my car but after this I'm not sure. Let's see if they stand behind their product. To be continued..</text>< name>

Bought a brand new car from Hyundai stockton and we didn't thoroughly look it over...so it's partially our fault!!! but under 20 miles and it had parts not attached or as they put it warped, we found a huge globe of grease in the trunk, they actually damaged parts of the car detailing it and neglected to even clean others. Bottom line we don't trust this place or the staff and really wish we would have went to another dealership since management is very hostile and behaved like he would prefer to fight over resolving issues. Overall we like the Hyundai we bought but learned our lesson about Stockton Hyundai they are not owned by Hyundai and who ever does own the place hires people who dont really care and it's very clear.<//text>

< Review>
Very  rude sales manager!! I don’t believe in showing total interest in a car in order to give them the best selling strategy.  When I would not commit to buying a car today they basically showed me the door!! Very ghetto!! I would never recommend buying from a dealership who has no professionalism. Looks like I’m gonna go to Tracy!<//Review>

I was very pleased with the service I received from Stockton Hyundai. My car was completed perfectly in the time they estimated. I did have one problem. When they parked my car after service, they parked under a tree. Apparently birds live in that tree because there were many bird droppings all on the left and back of my car. My car was brought in clean as I had went through the car wash the day before. I notified the service team and they said they could have the detail guys to wash it, but it would be a 45 minute wait. I didn't habe time to wait that long, but as I was leaving my boyfriend saw one of the detail guys in the back, explained what happened and he promptly asked me to pull over so he can rinse and wipe down my vehicle. I don't know his name, bit thank you.< /review>

Staff lies to banks to get your loan approved without your knowledge and once the bank confirms the real figures they pull out from the funding your vehicle.
Bad dealership, bad sellers, and very bad service.< /Review>

<Text>I brought my car in for a flat tire during company lunch hours but was still assisted by an employee with getting checked in. It only took about an hour for them to change the tire and in the end I received a brand new tire which was billed to the insurance company leaving me with no out of pocket costs.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>I was getting my car serviced and they asked if I wanted to trade my car end I said give me an appraisal of what my car is worth they said $11,000.00. He said bring it in when you have time and choose the car that you want and my boss will work with you on your remaining balance to get you the car that you want. So I go on my only day off to do just that only to have them wast my time and say I need to sell my car because they won’t except a trade in for my car after already telling they would.

What a waste of my time and horrible customer service. I’ve purchased 2 cars from here but I will never step foot in there again and I’ll tell everyone I know not to go there and about that horrible experience and them wasting my time.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Went to buy a new Palisade. Sales people were great. But then we asked for the price of the car. They came back at $15,000 over the window sticker. In addition to tax and license They said it was for dealer markup and accessories - neither of which were posted on the window. We shared an equote for less than MSRP at Tracy Hyundai. They said all Hyundai dealers were marking up the Palisades and that Tracy wouldn’t have the car or honor the equote. We drove to Tracy and bought the same car for $12,000 less than Stockton Hyundai quoted. If you are looking to buy a Hyundai, go to Premier Hyundai of Tracy and ask for Ronnie Mcneil.< /review>

I was told that it is the double cluch that makes my car do that and they put in new soft ware in the car but the problem is still there and i was told by the service dept. that they have had many complaints about that problem. Please FIX the problem it's very irratating. Don't buy the Tuson or any car that has the double cluch.<//Review>

I had a Great Experience at Stockton Hyundai. I decided to give their service department a try on my 2011 Sonata and was treated right, so when the itch to purchase a new Sonata hit me I felt good in coming to the Dealership. Joe Veltri was great. He made the negotiations simple and easy. I told him what I wanted and he did his best to make it happen. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Daniel in Finance made everything clear and easy to understand. I appreciate the way I was treated and would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a vehicle.<//text>

Treat me like an idiot, worst experience.
How can you try to sell used car way more expensive than the brand new one? I always love Sonata and want to buy one, but you guys are so... Wow I do not know how to call it. I never want to go back there. I think you should change the management there. I rather buy Sonata at the other dealer shop.<//text>

< Review>
Before coming to this dealership I exchanged emails. I was looking for blue Elantra SEL. I had email confirmation for particular price on particular stock# and VIN. They asked about my arrival time so the car would be ready by then. I drove 60 miles... But when I came they refused to sell that particular car (to be exact - I wanted any blue Elantra SEL) for previously agreed price.... Typical shameless bait and switch.  Ohh well - I just left...</Review>

Horrible Service!! My car has been in the shop for the same thing 3 times. Each time I informed it was ready; it was not. This repair problem has been happening for over a year. Told i need a $1990 repair to fix the problem; been back twice since making the payment. Total time in the shop from mid November and still there. Horrible...Horrible< /review>

I'll do this in parts. Bare with me you wanna know this. I'm not a difficult person or like to complain but I gotta warn people. Haha

I went online to shop around for Hyundai elantra and this dealership had very competitive prices, almost too good to be true. I was looking at one vehicle specifically and I made a appointment to see that vehicle. I drove over two hours to get there and when I get there they tell me that competitively priced vehicle sold the previous day (it's a lie) and they baited and switched me to another similar vehicle that was more money and in worse condition. On top of that the second vehicle they showed me, that vehicles listing online had false information. They listed that vehicle with pictures of another vehicle without seat staining to trick people into thinking that the vehicle is in good condition. I had to point out to them that the pictures they had up for that vehicle online isn't the same car due to features that were missing due to it being a lower trim model, they acted surprised but they know what they're doing.

Every single vehicle I got into and looked at was filthy and not a single car I saw didn't have stains set in the seats. There were cars with 2k miles with stains everywhere! Dog hair, crumbs.. it was weird.

I test drove another vehicle, we got back, sales guy (Salvador) disappeared and the finance guy fast tracked me to the desk and started asking my numbers. Credit score, down payment, trade in, etc. I told him that we haven't even negotiated the price of the vehicle yet so I'm not ready to give numbers. HE TOLD ME THE VEHICLE PRICE WASN'T NEGOTIABLE. He told me maybe he can take $100 off but that's it. What the hell is the point of having a dealership if they don't wanna deal or sell you a car? I walked. They didn't care, seems like they didn't want the sale.

If he would have worked with me I would have bought a car that day. Credit was above 800 but I had cash to buy the car outright.. we never got there. I'm going to Honda instead.

P.S. To my initial sales guy Salvador you're a great sales guy, you should have stuck with me instead of handing me off to some finance guy that didn't even know the car I was trying to buy.</Review>

Me and my dad were out looking for some cars and came across Hyundai to see a pre-owned truck my dad was interested in, Ezau and Alejandra helped us along with the process and my dad ended up leaving very satisfied with his 2014 Ford F-150, most definitely recommend Hyundai for a great buying experience!</Review>

<Review>I had a problem with my engine. It was making a loud knocking noise. Dealership checked it out and told me it would need a new engine. They supplied me with a rental car while we waited for the engine. Service adviser Robert kept me up to date on the progress. Everything was covered by warranty. I was very happy with the service.
Now at 75000 miles my transmission went out. Took 3 weeks to get it. I was originally told the trans would be here by August 24 then after calling I was told the 30th. Rediculus that parts Dept can't find a trans mission for 3 weeks. Pathetic. I think everyone dropped the ball here. And this after the engine failed at 50000 mile and took 6 weeks to get. I will never deal with you guys again and will never buy or recommend a Hyundai to anyone.< /Review>< Date>

Loved my experience with Stockton Hyundai.  Salesman Miguel and James were great and worked well with me.  Took car in for service a few days later to replace the windshield and they were great too !  Will recommend Stockton Hyundai !</Text>

Before I went into Hyundai of stockton I was denied 6 times within the same day by other dealers. As soon as I was parked I was greeted by Brittany, very friendly and very helpful. Even though she was learning the ropes, she was able to answer question that I had. Carlos my salesman greeted me at the door and got straight to the point. Told him what I was looking for and I didn’t have any money to put down and I had bad credit. “No Problem” Carlos said. Long story short Carlos got me approved for financing in less than an hour and I drove off with a 2018 Hyundai Elantra<//review>

Went to get my oil pressure switch replaced. Ended up having to replace my fuel rail ( technically my fault because I authorized the risky removal. It was damaged due to stripping. ) The car was in the shop for 13 days. This is not why I’m giving a low review. The main reason was because some klepto of a maintenance tech stole my usb 12 v port charger. That I do not appreciate. Keep your valuables and other small items on you. This is the first time it has happened as I’ve been here a few times, but this should be noted.</text>

Missed several opportunities to get it right.  they missed the first appointment that was set by Genesis consierge service link. They never called with explanation for missed appointment. They didn't call back the second time I contacted them personally to schedule a 2nd appoinmentv and spoke to the service person that she'd me if he could call me back. He didn't. When I contacted them again the service person that gave me that lame excuse didn't even have a hoarse voice during the time I was as speaking to them. Also I don't think one person at the service center should be there only person that can keep things going when someone is sick. We set another appointment. The service person then showed up 30 minutes late to my appointment with a Hyundai Elantra even though my Genesis contract states I should receive a Genesis G80 model or next model above mine which would be a G90. Again the same person gave me another lame excuse why they couldn't at least bring a G70. Service department then kept my car 1½ days for general maintenance and turned one of the brake rotors. Then they have me run aroundv the next day as to when my car would be returned that day. I called 3 times that afternoon checking status of my car. It took 4 hours after they said my car was ready to return it to my house from the dealership. The dealership is located 25 miles from my house. I've had 4 service calls since I purchased my G80 sport. Hands down they were the most unprofessional service department I have dealt with in the 1½ years I've own this car. They were clearly not ready to become Genesis certified.<//text>

<Review>So, like so many others I love this place. The service department is beyond amazing in customer service. They remember my name when I go in and details from the last conversation. When my car made an inconsistent noise and woudn't make the noise when they tried it they went out with me while I drove the car to find the noise. I don't know about the sales dept.  But the service department has consistenetly provided amazing service and reasonably priced. Even when I got estimates from another place, this one came in lower price without me even telling them I had got an estimate elsewhere. So a special thanks to Xavier, Tim, Babba, Mark, and Chat!< /Review>< user>

We went in to just look, then we met with Jordan, he was accomadating to our situation.  He helped us get the Hyundai Tucson and we couldn’t be happier.  Brittany was so nice as well, very personable and understanding.  I would recommend any of my family and friends to go to this dealship if they are looking to purchase a vehicle.  Even the paperwork portion of it was painless!  We are so jazzed because we did not think we could get a brand new suv, and Jordan made it happen!! Merry Christmas to us!!</Text>

Wanted to share an amazing experience I had buying from Stockton Hyundai !

Like most people my age I went there full of questions and was pretty much lost. Kandi morales was the sales lady name and she was absolutely amazing. She walked me through all avenues of what I Could possibly do as far as purchase or lease, type of vehicles for my specific need  and any questions that I had in regards to the process. She helped me into my new vehicle with as little stress as possible and for that I am forever greatful ! Would recommend any customer to

< review>
They falsely advertise the mileage on their used cars. Went in looking at the used 2017 Veloster turbo that they were advertising with 7800 miles on multiple websites and the paper on the window of the car. Turns out the real mileage was more than double that. We were only seconds away from the signing the deal when I double checked and saw the real mileage. When I asked them about it they basically told me "so what". This would have been my second vehicle from this dealership but now I will never give them my business again. Shady sales team and watch out for the short white guy with tattoos. He will lie to your face.<//review>

The night we signed paperwork there was nothing wrong with the car, they wanted to  Keep the car to clean it. So the next day when we took possession of the car it was dark and they were about to close. my husband and I  Saw damage on the car we told the manager on duty and she told us to come back the next morning, so they could take a look  and  take pictures of it. Now fast forward 2.5 weeks the vehicle we got STILL isnt finalized to the point that I'm worried whether or not I'm gonna have a car,  so I speak to a manager there tell him my concerns and  make arrangements to just bring the car back due to lack of funding on their part, i get threatened by him that if I don't bring the car back NOW he will call the cops and report it stolen. Told him they were closing in 10 mins and I live 30 mins away i wouldnt make it there in time, I told him I will bring it back in the morning because i needed to keep my things out of it once we return the vehicle they are trying to stick us with a $250 bill for the damages even though it happened before we took the car< /Text><gmap_id>0x80900cc8669b8a83:0x5ca1220efc19bdba<//gmap_id><Rating>1<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I pulled into the lot and it looked nearly abandoned, not a single sales rep was on the lot! I parked and walked into the showroom and immediately smelled  B.O. There were about a dozen employees sitting and watching a game in the waiting room, even swearing at times. The representative was helpful but the damage had been done, very unprofessional dealership.< /text>< Pictures>

I had an appointment with Miguel Reyna, I walked in on a Friday night and was out in just a couple of hours. From start to finish, I ever never had such an enjoyable car purchase experience. I was purchasing a second car and was kind of worried with one income. They got me in a car with 37mpg.
Miguel has called and checked to make sure everything is going alright with the car. The gentleman in finance was so funny and nice, and gave me lots of tips!

They just want to sell a car and after that they don't care anymore. I had to re-schedule 4 times for a follow up on my due bill contract. Very poor customer service. I waited for 4 hours and they told me that the guy who will fix my car scratches did not show up. They should've tell me ahead so I avoided the wait. Very unprofessional! Very inconsiderate ! BAD PLACE TO BUY A CAR! BAD SERVICE & CUSTOMER SERVICE!<//Text>

Usually car buying is not an enjoyable process but this time was different. From the initial welcome to the goodbye and enjoy it was a 'no pressure' zone. CJ Quezada worked with me and very patiently explained all my options and I felt like he was trying to find the best car for me at a price I was comfortable with. They had many options in stock and I ended up with the car I really liked; even the color I wanted!

I am very happy with my purchase and I recommend you take the time to go there and check out their options. Everyone there was friendly and helpful from the sales associate to the service department.< /text>

<text>We bought a used 2013 Veloster and couldn't be happier with overall experience!  Jim was very friendly and helpful and Alex made the paperwork process fast and easy.  Thank you guys for staying late for us.  We will defiantly recommend Stockon Hyundai to our friends and family.< /text>< pictures>

Hi my name is Amanda. I just bought my first car from Stockton Hyundai. I bought a Kia Forte and its exactly what I was looking for. When I got there I was greeted and test drove different cars. Joey Veltri and Alex Hidalgo helped me and it was a great experience. Definitely recommend this business.<//Text>

On Monday January 22, 2018 my phone rang at 4:36 am , it was my daughter Rickie , "Mommy I need you and Mario , I was just Tboned on my way to work on the driver side and the guy took off, I need you now"  I had to get to my daughter as fast as I could 15 minutes away , not knowing if she was hurt, pinned in the car , or ok. I picked up mario from work because he dropped his phone on his way out the door that morning.
Within 10 minutes I made it to my daughter. I pulled up saw she was out of the car unhurt, thank you to my daddy for always keeping us safe. She was checked out and was found with a bump on her head. Her 1993 Toyota Tercel was a total loss. That little car was good to he and kept her safe.
After a few hours she called me again , " Mommy ( no mater what age they all call me Mommy) can you come get me and take me to get a car, life continues, I would like to see if I can get the Elantra . So I took her to Stockton Hyundai. We pulled up, she knew what she wanted and could afford. Chris came out and we spoke for a minute , he went and got the car she wanted. We went on a Test Drive , not just around the block but on the freeway for a few miles. Yes Rickie was still shaken from the accident but she did great. We got back and not having the best credit she was unsure she would be able to get the car she had fallen in love with. Chris asked us to let him do his job. I could not cosign , she had to do it on her own.
Monday turned out to be the Lucky day for my daughter, she was unhurt from the accident  and Chris and the amazing finance manager worked magic and Rickie was signing papers for a 2018 Hyundai Elentra SE . This car was her first big girl purchase , she is 29 and works hard has two beautiful step-daughters , a wonderful boyfriend, and needed a safer, bigger car for her family.
I cannot stop crying happy tears each time I think of the way the whole staff at Stockton Hyundai made this happen for my daughter. I will never stop telling people how they helped her.
They say on the website , good credit or bad credit we will help you . And they speak the truth.
Thank you again Chris for All you have done !</Review>

Didnt have the santa fe sport and they couldnt even find the right car for the remote, i wanted  to drive the sport 2.0 turbo fully loaded, its has a ton of features and they didnt let me test drive that, they showed me a base model, so im not impressed i think ill just go to modesto instead.</Review>

I had to return my car after having it 7 days due to the fact they couldnt get me financed.

Edit to update: I received a call from the service director. My money has been refunded and I learned later that the person who okayed work on the vehicle without first obtaining permission and then charging was fired. Frustrating, but accidents happen and I'm glad the issue was resolved.< /Review>

I noticed an issue with my fuel gage so of course I took it in.  My tank when full, initially read 500+ miles before empty and I recognized it slowly declining; 480 until empty, 450, 416, etc.
After several attempts they finally concluded that it had always been that way and there was never anything wrong with it.  They even had the audacity to say, "Well you have the standard Hyundai." Um excuse me? I may not be a mechanic, but last I heard a standard vehicle just meant features not the engine am I right? Of course I know the difference from a hybrid, but that comment still carried absolutely no relevance in this situation.
Like I mentioned in the beginning, moronic.  My next hyundai will not be bought from that dealership.<//Text><rating>1<//rating><username>karla alcantara</username></record></dataset><record>

The Kona that you inquired on for 18255 is the best price in the market for that car. We received your offer and politely declined. Per your words we said “No, but thank you.” An accusation of bad customer service is unfounded in this situation. The only thing that we did his decline your offer, and I hope you don’t take it personal. It is simply a business decision, thank you again.'}< /Resp>
