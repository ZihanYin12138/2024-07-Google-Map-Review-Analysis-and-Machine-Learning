<Review>This place reminds me of my childhood,Friday night pizza with my siblings! Featuring a brick wall, checkered table mats, blackboard walls with stylish writing on it (the menu) a semi open kitchen, (90’s style) soda fountain and even an old skool (sit down) 80’s arcade game!
As for the pizza itself: they do pizza by the slice here which I appreciate. Heavy cheese that’s distributed more from the center and less near the crust. I like the pizza here a lot I only mention criticism for aficionados. Somewhat typical “New York style” I see around la but less big and less thin. I can tell they use very good ingredients. They don’t seem to be trying to do anything radically new or different but that’s kind of what you would want from a place like this.

The staff was really polite and seemed friendly.

The price point is very good. (For the area especially) $3.00 piece of cheese, not absurdly big but big enough to feel I got my money’s worth. If the slice was bigger I would make it a point to come back again and again. For now I would pick Roccos over most other places in the area.
I like the 90’s ninja turtle vibe, the price is good, the quality of pizza is rather good. It has a homey feel to it. Definitely a solid place to have a work meeting at.

Definitely business meeting and also sports bar vibe.< /Review>< Pics>

Was really expecting better. I was really excited to try out some good NY pizza in LA, saw the reviews here and thought I was in for a treat. Sadly I was underwhelmed by this pizza joint. I ordered the 10” Hawaiian style pizza, the prices are typical for non chain pizzas around LA but the taste wasn’t anything too special. As far as the restaurant goes it’s pretty nice with a cool vibe, service is alright and everything is made fresh. Don’t know if I was expecting too much for if NY pizza just isn’t good on the west coast. Overall this place is a good place to eat a decent pie.<//Text>

Service was phenomenal and the pizza was delicious. I had the pleasure of being served by Angie, who made us feel at home. Please don't leave bad reviews just because it's not "New York" enough for you, you are in Los Angeles.< /Review>

This is my first time here, and the experience was fantastic. They've got decent food and helpful workers here. Now they were my dream pizza joint. They also had a large range of toppings and ingredients. Their price is very competitive with other pizza restaurants in the area. I'm sure I'm going to bring my whole family here this weekend, and let them taste their yummiest pizza!< /Text>

Great neighborhood joint vibes!

Their chicken parmigiana sandwich is slightly different than what you might expect, instead of a single breaded filet it's cut into strips. Lots of flavor and texture, also piping hot.

Highest recommendation for pizza, sandwiches, and salads.

Outstanding service and helpful attitude towards new customers.

My mom brought me to this place since I love pizza. I was so really fascinated by this place. I mean this place has a nice and warm ambiance. The staves were very friendly and accommodating. The pizza that they served was so delicious and satisfying. I like how crunchy their thin crusts pizza. The cheese was perfectly melted. Ahh! What a great place to eat pizza!</Review>

I love this place.  We always get the classic Rocco's Neighborhood Pizza and the buffalo wings.  The salad is great.  I just love this place.  If I had to pick my last meal it would be a little start deep dish.  I also go to the little star on Mission and the food is just as good there.  I like the Mission location because there is more light and it is easier to park.<//Text>

The products are new and there are invigorating flavors. Try a must. Dessert is a must, too, to save your appetite! Maybe this isn't the best pizza you've had in your whole life, but it's still decent and reliable.<//Text>

There was a really nice pizza. Excellent operation. For girls, it is appropriate. Inside or out, you should eat. It's been very busy. Some were locals, I believe. If you are in the city, it is so convenient.</Review>

Visiting this Coffee shop was an ideal decision indeed. I relax and feel comfortable with their assistance. I was not mistaken about choosing this Coffee shop to chill out. It was really hard to find such a qualified place with my taste. I am deeply impressed by how they handled their service correctly with no hassles at all.< /Text>

Second time here, just as great and used my previous yelp review to order the white pizza again. Love the thin crust, great garlic tang and topped with seasonal veggies. Also love the spicy chicken wings, great heat, not greasy dunked in the blue cheese=scrumptious. Wine selection, on tap, is great. If u don't want to travel to tony's in north beach try this restaurant.< /Review>

Excellent pizza. Usually I am not into deep dish pizzas, but the vegetarian was absolutely amazing. It was a little dark, but it was a nice ambience. The size of the pizza was good for the price and the house salad was good for two people! I also thought it was strange that it was cash only. WIERD.< /Text>

Their deep dish pizza is everything it's rumored to be and more. So so so delicious.

I highly recommend getting it to go though. The place smells very B.O. meets patchouli oil meets day old marijuana smoke. Plus, pizza makes the best leftovers. I don't feel so bad paying $20 for a small pizza when it's more than enough for 3+ meals.< /Text>

Not sure if I was starving but we ordered the thin pesto pizza ($20) and I was surprised by how much I liked it. I do wish the cheese had more pull but it was good! Will definitely go back and try the garlic bread and some of their other pizza choices. It was pretty crowded on a weekday night but even without a reservation we snagged one of the few empty tables left.<//Review>

<text>The pizzas here are quite tasty! I love that they are fresh and wood-fires. You can truly taste the quality. The service was also efficient and quick. We waited no more than 10 min for our pizzas.

Definitely recommend coming here, could be a great date night.</text><rating>4</rating><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Little Star is some of he best pizza I have ever had. There is nothing I can say here that hasan't been said a 100 times in other reviews. Can't go wrong here, even as a date spot for pizza the ambiance is really nice too. I really like their cornmeal pizza crust</text>

<Review>I've been coming here for years and the corn meal crust deep dish pizza is amazing. The "Classic" (sausage, onion, mushroom, pepper) deep dish is a must have here. The wings are also delicious if you want an appetizer. My last meal here I had dessert for the first time at Little Star, usually I'm too full after pizza, and the pumpkin cheesecake I had was very tasty and seasonally appropriate. I now live in Washington DC and I like Little Star so much that I make it a point to come back when I'm in town.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This cute little restaurant was a great place for my sister and I to hang out and have a bite. The options were good and the food and pizza cooked fast in their brick oven. We had a good view of the oven from our table and I was able to keep my eyes on our Khachapuri!<//review>

All the 4-star reviews are on point! Little star pizza is perfect in every way! We ordered a deep dish cheese with ricotta, roasted garlic, fresh mozzarella, pepperoni and fresh basil. It was delicious! It's too bad we were only visiting for a few days, or we would have definitely broken our rule to not visit any food place more than once on our trip!<//review>

Albany spot, but I enjoyed the same cornmeal crust and bottomless pie over here.  I still think Paxti's has them beat (it's the greater cheese to sauce ratio), but paired with a Blue Star Wheat, this is a not miniscule star.  I also finally tried their chicken wings.  I was generally impressed, but they were a bit puny.</Review>

Was in town for the LACMA and searched for local favorites and Rocco's popped up. If you like a good pizza pie or some ridiculously fresh, soft & hot bread then Rocco's is a must. My girlfriend orderd a slice of cheese pizza and it's seriously the best cheese pizza I ever had, so much flavor. I ordered the ravioli and calzone and once again was very impressed. It was slow when we went so service was quick. Parking garage located behind restaurant.</Text>

Rocco’s is FANTASTIC 👍
For months I went to my physical therapy appointments in the building next door to Rocco’s and finally one day I thought .. I have a little time, I’m going to try it.

I always get their lunch special. A half Greek chicken sandwich, which is wonderful. Chicken can be bland but this chicken has a nice flavor with fresh veggies, lettuce. Tomatoes, red onion , green peppers and feta cheese with their original Italian dressing on the side & it’s fabulous. I think they must bake their own bread too because it’s wonderful. Fresh and soft. Really helps make the sandwich.

I really like their chicken noodle vegetable soup too.
Not too many noodles or veggies. Broth is good. I ate the soup many times when I thought I was coming down with a cold. It helped & I always enjoy it.

It’s all fresh food.

They have pizza 🍕 specials on tues & Thursday at 9.99 for cheese and then a $1 a topping so I’m going for the pizza on Tuesday.

And.. they just built the cutest outside area with twinkle ✨ lights so you can sit outside & eat in a nice environment with some privacy.

I really like Rocco’s I hope they stay in business & can get through this time of uncertainty.

If you’re looking for fresh delicious food give them a try & support a local business. 👍<//text>

Excellent pizza and arugula salad delivered by Caviar. Very confusing situation tho- LS website says they only deliver through Door Dash and Postmates. But those sites only show a mixed greens salad.

Caviar's LS menu shows multiple salads.

Why the difference ? What's going on?<//Text>

Super delicious! The thin crust was perfect. Not so thin that it got soggy, or cracker like. Great balance of toppings and flavors. A little pricey, but well worth it.<//Text>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>Excellent pizza and arugula salad delivered by Caviar. Very confusing situation tho- LS website says they only deliver through Door Dash and Postmates. But those sites only show a mixed greens salad.

Caviar's LS menu shows multiple salads.

Why the difference ? What's going on?</Review>< pictures>

Little Star had a 45-minute wait for a table, but the four of us in our group already expected that. It's clearly a popular spot, and it was a Friday night. We ordered the large Classic deep dish pizza (23" with sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green bell peppers) to share when the hostess took our name after she told us that it takes 30 minutes to cook.< /review>

My first time tasting the pizza today! We got sausage and spinach, and it was glorious! We drove from South Shore to Bridgeport.  It was definitely worth it. I wish they had chicken wings, but sometimes it's best to stick with what you're great at, and they have it mastered for Los Angeles tavern style pizza!< /Text>

<Text>Best pizza ever !!  (and I don't even like pizza very much, but I will eat Rocco's any day of the week).  I love their salads and their marinara sauce.

Rocco’s made it possible to have some normalcy this year.  Yummy pizza and a movie via Zoom with my second graders was such a thrill.

The ambiance at this Valencia classic is really fun. The whole restaurant is done in dark wood and the bar has really cool light bulb lights over it. There is usually a wait, but you can call ahead to get your name on the list.</Text>

The pizza is a bit on the pricey side, but if you want to treat yourself, this Is the place. The flavors are also interesting and complex, so I recommend trying something different.</Review>

<review>I'm fairly critical of Italian food. In the worst possible way. I tend to think of it as simplistic and uncomplicated, and therefore, something I can "do at home". Unlike more complex dishes with more diverse ingredients (ie. Cambodian food), I can look at an Italian dish, figure out what makes it tick, and make it at home. For pennies on the dollar.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I had a classic deep dish and have nothing but positive things to say about the pizza. Wouldn't get this that often since it cost around 20-25 for a small pie but would not hesitate to go here again if I'm craving deep dish pizza.<//Review>

<text>Five stars is not enough.   I decided to host a last minute holiday party this past weekend at my home for about 25 guests, and Rocco's did an amazing job of catering for me.  Not only was the owner, Angie, and her team members I spoke with (Zac and John) incredibly responsive, kind, and helpful, but they called morning of to confirm all of the details of my order and delivered promptly at the promised time and assisted with set up.  Reasonable prices, delicious food, and amazing customer service.  You won't be disappointed. They will be my top choice for future catered events!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Everything about this place is 5 stars - atmosphere, service, food & drink! The pizza here was some of the best I have ever had. Cocktails were original and very tasty. Even the dessert was great.< /text>

This spot is my favored. I visit many restaurants but to this restaurant I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very professional and the food they serve is so appetizing. I never miss an opportunity to have a decent dinner in this restaurant. Highly recommended.< /Text>

The honey bear pizza is probably the best pizza I've had in the valley.  Perfect blend of sweet and savory flavors.  Soft, fresh crust - not too doughy or sour.  Good draft selection and the fire pit on the patio is great for cold nights.< /Text>

Our favorite pizza place in SF! Super yum pizza at very reasonable prices, It is often very crowded, especially on weekends, so we usually call in our order, so that we can just pick up our pizza to go.< /text>

Made a reservation online for a party of 8 and came here for my birthday celebration. The restaurant was surprisingly crowded but we were seated very promptly once our party arrived. Service was pretty good although the bar was backed up for a bit and our drinks took some time to arrive.</review>

Great food, love the Caesar Salad and their Pepperoni pizza. Cannolis are delicious as well. Everything is a bit expensive, but hey you get what you pay for. Best pizza hands down. Will come back again,Rocco's Neighborhood Pizza  has never let me down.< /Review>

This was my first time to Rocco's neighborhood pizza. The pizza was cooked very well (no soggy center, no over done crust). The sausage was so juicy and tasteful. I ordered a meatball on the side just to try (love me some meatballs) reminds me of my grandpa's meatballs and sauce. That's amoré!

If you are ever in the area this place is a good pizza place, quick and very nice service.<//Review>

<Text>This is a great late night pizza place. It's super small but well worth the wait in line. The pepperoni pizza totally hit the spot for me last night and when I'm out in that area again I'll definitely be going back. There is another pizza place a few doors down and Arinells is much better by far!</Text><resp>None<//resp>< Pictures>

Incredible Italian dishes, risotto was probably one of the best I've had. Service was on point, we had a group of six in my party. Luckily some of my friends got there early, had to wait an hour on a Monday night but nbd. I believe this is the norm for San Rocco's.<//Review>

Terrific old school pizza place. Highly recommend the pizza. This crust and the sauce is very good. Slice are good size so you may need to fold them in half. Service is very good. Great place to watch a game. Not a chain restaurant and that is a compliment.<//Review>

5 star pizza.  Good crust, fresh ingredients, fast service. That's all I ate here.  Basic dining room.  It's very casual and was relatively clean.  Temper expectations with respect to what the place looks like but come for great food.  Draft beer selection isn't huge but decent local options (805, lagunitas, peroni, etc.).  A couple of TVs with sports on but no sound.  Would definitely go back.< /Text>

<Review>Stay away. The chicken was so dry, I was wondering if I was going to pull splinters out of the top of my mouth. The jalapeño’s were pickled from a can, and if they consider this Brooklyn style pizza, they’ve apparently lost the recipe, because it is far from it. Lastly, the price point for this is horrible and a ripoff.</Review>< user>

Everything on the menu is amazing and delicious - from the salads to the deserts, and especially the pizzas.  I've eaten there about a dozen times and taken out 4 or 5.  The food has always been great.  Eating there is fun and casual with a great local vibe.  I usually have to wait for a table, but hanging out in Glen Park can be fun too.<//Text>

Great food

Meatballs were delightful and the Italian sausage was insanely good and fresh! I could have eaten a whole tray.

Pie was decent and the garlic toast really good.

Service was a little slow but I loved the time to check out the charm of the dining space.

Check them out!!!!!< /review>

<Review>Best NY pizza in Los Angeles! I'm from (NJ) NY so I know what I'm talking about. All those other places are second rate! Angie the owner is wonderful and always makes sure you feel welcome as does the whole staff! Prices are great too! Don't miss their chicken parm sandwiches or calzones either.< /Review>< name>

Doesn't live up to the google hype at all. I don't get it. Pizza was decent, but you can get better slices or pies anywhere else in CA and it won't cost $25 for a pizza. 3 star review is for the food, not the price. The waiter was really great though.<//text>

<Text>This is our go-to, can't fail, make everyone happy pizza place. Great staff and management, great pizza. I assume all the other food is good, too, but we're pretty dedicated to the pizza. Great for take out or eat in, and has a couple tabletop videogame consoles, which any decent pizza place should have. Lots of TVs for watching sports, nice beer selection.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Great homey feeling along with awesome service. Looks like cozy italian diner with salad, sandwiches, beer and speciality pizzas galore. Handmade in front and sports always on along with Tuesday and game day specials! Grubhub is deliver of choice and pickup also available. Gotta try at least one big slice!</Review>

They have square slices of pizza on a focaccia type bread. I love their veggie pesto and its part of my Los Angeles ritual. Combo is great too. Garlic-clam is nice and different. Make sure to carry some cash.< /text>

<Response>None</Response><review>This is our go-to, can't fail, make everyone happy pizza place. Great staff and management, great pizza. I assume all the other food is good, too, but we're pretty dedicated to the pizza. Great for take out or eat in, and has a couple tabletop videogame consoles, which any decent pizza place should have. Lots of TVs for watching sports, nice beer selection.<//review><date>1504998610442<//date>< gmap_id>

We stopped in while on vacation and the pizza was excellent.  I ordered a Sicilian pie and it reminded me of the pizza I used to eat as a kid in New Jersey.  Nice crust and good flavor.< /review>

The pesto pizza and Quattro formaggi are by far the best. This pizza is the closest thing to authentic NY pizza that I've had in southern CA. Our server Yuli took good care of our party of 8. Love coming here and it's great for the whole family!</Text>

The pepperoni was delicious, however. The service was quick and they were fine with customization. They give you a red pepper flake and Parmesan cheese packet for each pizza.<//Text>

Pizza is amazing pasta is OK ordered a chicken alfredo and was so bland and tasteless and very small portion I paid 18$ for the plate it just was not worth i make a better pasta at home.. it was pretty dissatisfying but  drinks and appetizers are good. I recommend the onion rings highly. Could of been a better experience</Review>

What your looking for is a  quick place to grab lunch and not destroy your wallet.  Your gut will be good and your wallet will ride easy.  Good service  makes it easy to return and get what you want without a lot of fuss.   Menu choices are plentiful and  so far everybody has been smiling.< /review>

This would have been a 3 star review, but thanks to stellar customer service (on behalf of our server, John) I couldn't be quicker to change my mind. This was my uncle and I's first visit here and despite being avid restaurant goers, we don't usually bother leaving reviews.

We ordered a large pizza with several toppings, including bacon. It came out undercooked and rubbery which is a "no-go" for my uncle and I. When we brought it to John's attention, he couldn't be more responsive and accommodating. We suggested maybe that he take the bacon that was on the pizza and cook it longer as a means of being more reasonable, but he insisted they make it right and make a new one. He even insisted we keep the 1st pizza for our inconvenience which, even with no bacon, was DELICIOUS! It wasn't too doughy, the ingredients were fresh and they were very generous with the toppings.

We go out to eat almost all the time and we have experienced so many businesses that never bother to weigh to cost of repeat business vs bottom line. I would be thanking my lucky stars as a business owner in an economic climate like this to have an employee like John on their staff to look out for both the business AND the customers alike.

We will most certainly be eating here again and if you value the things I've written above, you ought to as well.< /Text>

<review>This place was remembered as THE place for Sicilian style 'zza about 2-3 years ago but it must have gone downhill big time because despite the fact that it was a busy Saturday night the pizza was worse than subpar. I understand that it was busy since it was Sat night but our order was incorrect and the pizza was under-baked and the toppings were skimped on and low grade. To make matters worse, I knew that they only made their Sicilian style in a certain size, a 12 slice rectangle which would have been happily and easily consumed if it were any good. In fact, it tasted worse (no surprise) by the next day, so nothing doing but to dump the remaining five and a half slices in the trash (yes, I somehow managed to choke down half a slice). What a waste. We went out of our way to go there to be disappointed. The only consolation was a two-fer with regard to my rose, but it was a moderate consolation.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Awesome staff who really showed a lot of respect to my autistic son Paul, he went here and ordered and paid for food all by himself for the first time. It is a big step for him on his 23rd birthday!<//Text>

I work down the street from this place so it has become a frequent lunch spot for me and coworkers.  Not only is this place delicious but they have a great lunch special.  You can either get two slices of pizza, one topping each, and a soda or one slice of pizza, also one topping, with a salad and a drink for $7.  I always go with the latter so I don't feel so bad about my diet, especially when the slices are enormous.

We've never had a problem finding a table here, even when we come with a large party.  The staff is very friendly and don't hesitate to ask for suggestions or for something made especially for you.  If you're in the area and want some pretty good pizza for a cheap price then I recommend checking this place out.  I have yet to have a bad experience here and I always look forward to my next visit.</review>

We enjoyed the sandwiches (we had a meatball and a chicken parmesan) but the pizza was just ok, no one really like it but they didn't hate it either. It was just ok (we had cheese, pepperoni, and BBQ chicken). The house salad has a balsamic vinaigrette which I enjoyed but the wife did not. Seemed hit and miss for everyone in our group, so I'd just say it was ok overall.</text></record>

<Review>The pizza looks delicious. So I thought it would be yummy on the 4th of July (yeah, I know, hot dogs are the thing but it's a free country and I wanted 🍕, damnit!) Ordered very easily on their website. Got my email confirmation that it would be ready in 30 minutes. Arrived a few minutes early to find...closed for the 4th! Really? It's 2018, you mean to tell me your website can't tell me this?! Needless to say I was highly perturbed but I still plan to celebrate the greatness of our country tonight. Just not the greatness of this joint.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>I usually don't eat as a Italian pizzaish restaurants because of all the carbs. As much as I love pasta and breaded parmesan and breaded eggplant and ziti and calzones I've been cutting back. Well my girlfriend and her kids and my son were all hanging out for a visit and she chose this restaurant right by my hotel  Kimpton Wilshire.
I mean literally you walk downstairs out the door turn right and walk 200 feet and there it is Rocco's. So because of my dilemma not to eat too many carbs we went and I searched the menu to find something. I ordered the meatballs and the Caesar salad. Let me tell you, those meatballs were huge and the sauce was out-of-this-world the meat was moist and juicy and I don't think I've ever had better meatballs in my entire life and I have traveled. It had just the right amount of spiciness to the sauce and everyone at the table agreed even the kids. Zack the waiter was very nice and invited me back to the restaurant tomorrow while I was visiting. I do believe I'm going back to try the grilled onions and peppers and sausage I can't wait.</Text><response>None</response><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

I used to order two or three times a week for lunch-time delivery but no more.  They have now instituted a $2.95 delivery charge, WTH!  Really?  $3 on top of the $10 sandwich – totally NOT WORTH IT!</Text>

Wow! I work a block away and needed to drop off a package. I waited thinking it was going to me busy. Once I got here I literally looked for where the line started stood there and not even .4 secs later was next! This location was fully staffed on a Saturday morning. My entire experience didn't last .60 secs.</Text>

Woe to any soul that may enter here. Like many others have said, if you are unfortunate enough that your package was dropped off here for pickup, either because of carrier incompetence or whatever reason, good luck picking it up.

I have tried to pick up a very expensive package 3 times over the course of 3 days and each time was told "we are too short staffed to give you your package".

It appears I'll be waiting indefinitely, and it appears I'll be filing a claim.<//review>

All I did was ask where the second floor was because I called ahead and they told me to go there. She was extremely rude. Started off with an attitude for no reason. Then, she told me to come back tomorrow even though the call told me the hours and it was still business hours. Simply refused to help.</text>

The lady refused to help me track my package that said it was delivered but never showed up at my door because service hours ended at 2pm. I looked all over the internet and it says nothing about service hours ending at 2pm, they are supposed to be open until 5pm. Walked out leaving so upset that the workers here can treat their customers with such a lack of respect.<//review>< Pics>

I usually go this post office once a week or two times a week for a long time and there is Guy his name is Chris Lebel who has a very bad attitude with customers, treat the customer like his servant or his employee,  never use a nice words like Thank you or Please and look like he does,t like his job and someone force him to do this. Today I went there to mail my envelope and after I waited 15 minutes in line and unfortunately went to his window, he gave me a form to fill it out and back again, we usually when we go to a window and suppose to fill out the form we go to the middle table and after finished go straight to the same window, but he told me I have to go back and stay in line again and after I  went again to the line and back to his window and asked him why did you do this to me? Do you make your own rules here? he refused to get my mail and send me to another window. While the other ladies on the other windows are very nice and polite, I'm surprise why the manager in this post office keep this employee and does't fire him. I try not to go to this post office any more and If I had to, I never  ever go to his window.I hope the manager read this and give him a serious notice to change his attitude with the customers specially me as a senior citizen. one star is too much for him and his supervisor who keep this employee there.</review>

The staff is also very rude. There’s one woman in particular that is usually always there and I can tell a lot of other reviews are talking about her. The staff here just don’t care at all about the customers.

I will be going out of my way to use another post office moving forward. I suggest everyone do the same.<//Review><Name>Tori Herman<//Name>< Rate>

A senior lady was being helped and the post office lady took a call without even saying  excuse me and walked away, she was  laughing and talking loud enjoying her call for more than 10 mins while the senior lady was just waiting. When my turn cane another post office woman told me “I don’t know” when I didn’t finished asking my question. She wouldn’t let me talk and kept repeating “I don’t know” louder and louder. When I asked to speak with a supervisor she said. “My supervisor will tell you the same. It should have been something simple but she wouldn’t ever hear my question. I work in customer service and if you really want to help you should at least listen. I can’t believe they get away with being soooo rude.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Beware, it your package is held for pickup because they couldn't figure out how deliver that day, you have to get there before 2pm. They are not allowed to hand you the package after 2pm.<//Text>

I had very unhappy experiences in this postal office, and I'll definitely avoid this postal office in the future. The employees (I talked to 3 of them today) were all unprofessional, impatient, and rude. If you ask them more than two questions, they'll give you attitude. This morning I asked them for a free tape or glue to seal my envelope which contained important paper work, but the male employee told me it was ok to mail it like that! Then he directed me to purchase a roll of tape on the counter for $3.99. Simply no any form of free service for you! And they always tried to trick you to buy something, and to use the more expensive services. Be cautious!<//text>

They are always rude here, and multiple packages have gone missing when dropped off and went missing when given to the mailman that recently started delivering in this area after the regular guy retired. 6 packages went missing at different times in less than a month!!!!! Message me if yours went missing as well.< /Review>

Zero star. Most unfriendly service ever. I was told the pick up window closes at 4:30pm. Drive in traffic for 30 minutes to get there before 4:30pm. They say it closes at 4 and unwilling to get up to help. This is a package they didn't even attempt to deliver because the delivery guy was too lazy to take the elevator to my office. The manager is there but they offer up a phone number instead. The manager obviously doesn't want to own up to their lack of service either.< /Text>

Just awful service. They have lost 3 packages of mine in the last year. I had to call the national postmaster and report them, but I'm sure it doesn't matter. One package was signature confirmation, they said I signed for it, when I never was even home. I filed a complaint, one month later it shows up on the ground in front of the apartment mailboxes with the signature confirmation sticker on it and no signature.
Today, I go to pick up a package that states "available for pickup" on tracking. No slip left with information in my mailbox. The guy helping me just tells me it isn't there and maybe the carrier took it back out. Maybe. Didn't bother to talk to my carrier, didn't offer to. . Just shrugged his shoulders and said it wasn't him. I've never interacted with people who gave less of a $%^&.<//Text>

<Review>Im here to puck up a package.  I've waited 14 min with 2 people ahead of me, noone was being served..  Finally someone came to counter.

The other counter people were not busy.  There were dribbles of customers.  But yet they would not answer my question nor get up to check on person who does the puck up counter.   The one lady just co yo ued to sing a bell, like a hotel check in counter.  Worst post office i have  ever been, of any city!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Most of the time when I go to a post office, the workers are in general are nice. This post office is full of rude staff. I’ve never been here before and I got snapped at for not knowing where the mail pick up line was. When I got to the mail pick up line, I got asked two times if I was sure I never received my package. I wouldn’t have even gone to this post office if I had my package delivered to begin with, I knew it was on hold because I placed it as such online. I wish I could avoid this post office, but I know I can’t. I just dread if I have to come back here again to pick up anything. The office on Santa Monica Blvd has way nicer people who are efficient and they are also open on Saturdays! Go there instead! Sadly this place is actually the major branch for this area and the Santa Monica post office isn’t so any mail holding or package pick ups will have to be done here.<//text>

Most, not all, of the clerks are quite friendly and helpful.
My issue is with the person in the back who for some insane and annoying reason will fold my postcards in half and damage them before putting them into my postbox! I collect postcards from all over the world, and despite my complaints or the fact that there is ample room in my postbox, the cards I receive are folded and ruined.<//review>

On Wednesday - February 14, 2018, at 11270 Exposition Blvd Post Office in West Los Angeles.  I waited in the line until called to the counter and I purchased the new book of Lena Horne Stamps.  Then I handed the postal worker my two birthday cards, which already had postage on them.  My brother called me when he received his card today 2/20/2018 and it was slit open on the side of the envelope and the money was stolen.  He sent me pictures of how he received his birthday card.  I was stupid to send cash, but I was in a hurry to get it there on time.  You can't trust the postal workers.  It's sad that they are not monitored, and there are not camera's watching what they do with peoples mail.  I am reporting it to the USPS at 11270 Exposition Blvd, West Los Angeles location and to the Police Department.  I have the photo's, but was unable to download them for some reason.< /review>

<username>Artmaul<//username><Review>This is by far the worst post office experience in the entire U.S.  If you have an opportunity to move out of zip code 90025, you should.  All the (office) employees are constantly lazy, in bad moods, and aggressively mean with the customers.  I've witnessed several loud verbal confrontations that have prompted customers to leave, out of fear of someone "going postal" -- their words.

I had mail on hold for a month, just got back into town; went to pick it up.  First and only person in line at the pickup window area.  4 customers in the entire place including me.  There were two employees working behind the counter.  I waited patiently for both to finish with the regular service customers.  The male employee promptly disappeared into the back, and still after 15 minutes of standing at the pick up mail window, not a single person acknowledged my existence.  Finally I asked the young female (who seems new) if I could get some help.  She loudly exhaled an exasperated sigh and rang their bell (which I'm convinced always falls on deaf, resentful ears).  At this point there were 4 new customers behind me asking if I had been helped yet.  I loudly said "no".  Another 10 minutes go by and the older (I think manager) leisurely strolls out, with a total look of spite on her face and asks me if she can help me.  I very respectfully and articulately give her my hold mail information, which she starts to write down, but then abruptly stops and decides to help everyone behind me first, telling me to "hold on a minute".  Another 15 minutes go by as everyone is promptly helped, and a young, very sweet Chinese (I say Chinese because it was obvious English was not her first language) woman is rudely dispatched for not understanding that she was in the wrong post office for her package.  Finally the place is empty.  This person finally says that she will be back and reconfirms my address.  After another 10 minutes, she returns empty handed and says that I have no mail and starts questioning me as if I had already picked it up.  Then she starts telling me that the mail carrier must have taken it out that morning.  I got to have a nice chat with the mail carrier, who was a total sweetheart, and she said that since she knows me, she was 100% certain that the mail was still at the post office, even offering to make an extra trip to get it for me.  Now I ask you.  The postal carriers are the ones out in the heat day after day busting their humps, yet they're nicer than these angry misanthropic office employees?  Can the postmaster general please fire all the office people and keep the delivery employees?  PLEASE?  To quote a guy in line behind me during this particular visit, "If you ever wanna f**k up your day, you come here.  In fact, I'd rather stick hundreds of needles in my eyes than have to deal with these people."  Sadly, there was a real nice woman who worked there at one point, but I haven't seen her in ages.  Perhaps all that evil negativity drove her away.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bba6d67e3c83:0x46c1073758a2bf14</gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

If they could get zero stars the rating would be more accurate.  I work for a local business; a school at that, and cannot believe the service (or lack of) from this post office.  We go days, several days... like over a week  kind of days without receiving any mail.  If they aren't delivering our mail, that means they aren't picking up our outgoing mail; and even sometimes when they deliver the mail, they still don't pick up the outgoing mail.  The building next door's address ends in 80 and our address ends in 30; NUMEROUS TIMES, COUNTLESS TIMES I've had to point out that the mail for ...80 was delivered to ...30 "in error".  This is so totally unacceptable!! Call to complain only to never speak with anyone.  The phone only rings.  Guess they already know they'd only be receiving complaints if someone actually answered the phone.  THEE WORSE SERVICE EVER!! TOTALLY UNRELIABLE!!<//review>

Would give a zero star if I could. I moved into the area 3 months ago, and so far I've had one $200 package allegedly delivered but never showed up (I have cameras installed, literally nobody ever came), one package that said was ready for pick up but ended up thrown over our gate with a giant hole on it. Not to mention these are some of the most rude and unhelpful stuff I've ever encountered at any USPS locations.< /text>

<text>About 3 weeks ago our regular carrier was changed to 2 or 3 different carriers.  Since our regular carrier has changed, our neighborhood has yet to receive our weekly grocery store flyers and coupons.  Our old carrier delivered them like clockwork.  A little over a week ago I went to the Post Office on Exposition Blvd to file a complaint.  I was not allowed to see the supervisor to voice my complaint, I was given an orange card to fill out my complaint.  I told the clerk at the counter who gave me the card what my complaint was to which she replied "most people don't want those."  I know several neighbors who want our flyers back !  Well it has been over a week now since my visit to the post office and we have still not received the current flyers.  Today I told the carrier that delivered our mail that I had filed a complaint and that we have not received our flyers for 3 weeks now.  Her reply was "really?"  No assurance at all of looking into this at all.  My next step will be to contact the grocery stores, Osh, and restaurants that pay good money for these flyers.  I am sure they would love to know how the Post Office is tampering with the mail by not delivering these flyers and coupons and how their advertising money is being wasted !  Maybe I can get my flyers if I could get to the post office trash cans.< /text><user>101699469302441769912< /user><rate>1</rate>< date>

If I could give zero stars I would. There have been numerous times that money/gift cards have been stolen from Birthday/holiday cards that mysteriously never arrived or that did arrive and were opened and taped shut or packages marked as delivered but that weren’t delivered. The Usps mail carriers are shady and shouldn’t be trusted. Just yesterday my mail man carelessly left the bottom row of mail boxes open, leaving other peoples mail out in the open for anyone to take and it could not be shut because only the mail carrier has the master key to our boxes...this has happened a few times before. If I could actually get in contact with the supervisor from this post office directly I would complain formally, though it is doubtful that anything would change. The USPS is just another US scam...truly a bunch of thieves!<//Text>

I had a frustrating experience lately at this post office but they did come through for me and help. Everyone was very pleasant. This was a one time experience, usually I find the staff rude and not helpful. I just called just to get my mail carrier's name and the phone rang for 3 minutes at least no one picked up. This branch needs an attitude adjustment and perhaps new staff with the exception of the people working there last Saturday, December 19, they all were very helpful!

I am adding to my review. For several weeks I have been getting other people's mail and then yesterday a friend called me to tell me the check she mailed to me with the CORRECT address went to someone else who a week after receiving it opened mail addressed to me and put a note in how nice she was to return the check to the person who sent it. Why did she open mail anyway that is not my concern. I am wondering why mail is not being delivered to the correct address? I tried calling the 800 number there is a one hour and 3 minute hold time, that is unacceptable, I tried calling the Rancho Park Post Office let it ring for 2 minutes no one picked up the phone. And the post office wonders why they are losing money????< /Review>

Worst post office! The staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. I stopped by there at 4:10pm for customer service but they refused to help me out because they said that the customer service closed at 4:00 pm. I didn't know that and actually I arrived there before 4pm but I had to wait in line. I don't want to visit this place again!!< /review>

<Review>It deserves below one star.  The worst customer service at the facility.  The never, ever answer the phone.  Whey post a number if it is never answered ?  They are rude, dismissive and not truthful at the facility.  Act like they are doing the customer a favor!

And, this is where our taxes go.  We pay their salaries and they treat us like garbage.

<Review>Wow wow wow... Judging by the other reviews on this page it seems to be the same story for us.  I have a tracked package that has been delivered twice, though I still have no package.  My father bought me an expensive watch to celebrate my 30th birthday, 2 weeks on and still no watch, no knowledge of where it is, no feedback, no communication.  I genuinely can't understand how this can be justified in business.</Review><time>1401907908560<//time>< Resp>

<Review>NOTARIZED LEGAL DOCUMENTS NEVER ARRIVED, once dropped off here on Exposition Blvd. It was 10:30 pm on Saturday and too dark to see much, albeit the place seemed oddly deserted. After dropping off the envelope, my second thought was that something was not quite right...but I reminded myself that this was the US Postal Service ...what could possibly go wrong- ?- This event caused a SERIOUS delay in the legal process, that continues nearly a month later. Bottom-line NEVER leave legal documents in the hands of the USPS. After reading these terrible reviews I'm befuddled! How could the greatest country in the world have such an inept mail system. Sadly, I've lost confidence in USPS that will likely never be restored.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This office is my distribution center and it's a nightmare. Our mail is delivered intermittently, which is to say, sometimes weeks go by with nothing or only one or two things, and then suddenly, all of our mail shows up, postmarked with dates 3 and 4 weeks previous. I've almost lost 4 packages because they haven't been delivered, and neither have the alert slips telling me to pick them up-or the follow up slips. In the first case, I had bought a package from an international vendor, and it was only when the vendor sent a message asking how I liked it that I realized it was supposed to be here. They kindly sent me the tracking info they'd had from their side and I found out it had been languishing for two and a half weeks with no notice whatsoever. I called, and of course, no one picked up the phone, which appears to be par for course at this location. I have *never* gotten through. So I called the USPS general number to find out how to get the package without a slip and they verified that it appeared the package was probably still around but close to the date of disposal (!) despite the fact that I had not as yet received a single notice.

So I went to the post office, armed with the package number I had received from the lovely woman on the USPS phone line. The desk staff were incredibly rude and impatient, but after waiting in a corner after explaining the situation as nicely as I could and somehow being treated as if I was at fault for not having a slip that had never been delivered in the first place, the staff person showed up with TWO packages. Apparently, two weeks earlier ANOTHER package had arrived, for which they had ALSO never sent any notice.

For weeks, mail service will be a little spotty but mostly reliable, if slow, and then these things will happen, often in a spate. I've even had packages ordered in the mail marked as "delivered" by the USPS which don't actually arrive until 2-5 days later. About 2 months ago, I had another package from a friend in MA take 4 weeks to get here, for no apparent reason, and currently, I have two packages, one from Amazon and another from a different vendor, shipped through FedEx, which, because our building is difficult to get into, apparently were fobbed off to the local USPS according to their respective tracking infos, both of them two weeks ago, and haven't been seen or heard from since, though they're marked as delivered. In the meantime, no mail has shown in my box for 4 days.

I am literally having packages mailed to friends in other zip codes now to avoid this nightmare. I honestly don't understand how this location is being run so terribly. I've never had an experience with a post office like this.<//text>

Regular customer, I come in with prepaid packages and a scannable shipment printout sheet everyday to make things easier for them... but NEVER IN MY LIFE, have I encountered more impolite, rude, and condescending people at this USPS office. Hands down the worst customer service experience ever anywhere.

One employee in particular, Juanita, is particularly frustrating to deal with. It's so bad I deliberately try to avoid her while there because she's just stuck-up and snappy.... even talks over me while I'm trying to ask questions. Overall... I'm extremely dissatisfied and had a very very VERY negative experience.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. AND STAY AWAY FROM JUANITA.< /review>

I'm not one to post negative experiences but this is quite honestly the worst experience I've ever had in a postal office. So much it really needs to be said.

80% of the people working there are just downright rude. Not many people know the ins and outs of sending mail so they go out of there way to make you feel stupid. Even when I'm trying to be polite after the fact the mail receptionist was rude, she continued to have an attitude.

I get it, you don't like your job. Just consider that there are some of us who just want to mail out stuff to our loved ones without having to deal with how miserable you are.<//text>

The worst service ever. The post master general should close this facility down or at the very least replace ALL employees at this facility. Zero customer service. The phone rings endlessly. No one ever answers the phone. I called numerous times and let the phone ring for up to 4 minutes each time. No one ever picked the phone up.< /text>

Extremely rude people, they made an error on their part and still gave me attitude when I wanted them to fix it. I had been waiting for important government documents for literally a month until the government agency contacted me to ask if I had received it. Apparently they had sent it already but the usps office sent it back. They literally never tried to deliver my package and I know this because my spouse works from home.<//text>

Few years ago, their slow service, additude, low staffing, would reflect some of the recent low reviews thats been posted.  But since a year ago or so I noticed a change towards the better. More friendlier staff, much more organized faster and efficient. Even during busy times i.e. holidays, they have lines but the wait is no where near as long as it once was. Plus as always; the location, large easy parking are a huge bonus.
We use this post office about 4 times a month and it clearly ranks much much higher than it once did. ... Thanks Exposition !</Review>

I had outgoing mail and not only did the mail carrier take my mail out of my mailbox, he threw it on my doorstep along with my mail which he could have put in my mail a slot!
Like everyone else here, they are the absolute worst. I am not getting my mail and luckily I called about a bill that was due the next day, never got it in the mail. They don't answer their phones.
How is it that nothing is being done about this?! Who the hell is running things over there?
Apparently nobody is.</text>

Very interesting I looked on your review listing and posting and not one of them said anything nice or decent about this particular branch of the post office maybe it's all branches.  The government is this messed up as you at the post office it's really sad.  The post office is people and many of the workers are minorities and in some cases all of these unhappy people relate the post office is shoddy abilities to the minorities shoddy abilities.  It's a shame that a worker can't take any pride in what they do.  No wonder so many workers kill themselves or go postal but what do you expect.  I didn't expect all of those negative reviews.<//text>

<review>The worst usps store! Came here twice. Everyone here is very rude and they don't want to help you with very bad attitude. Once I came here to pick up my package the next day I received the notice, a tall women told me to go home and wait for redelivery. Well when I was waiting, they already send my package back without any notice.  I could have had my package. Now I have to pay extra fee to reship the package. It's USPS's fault and all they said it they cannot help I have to reship it. Very worst experience, those people are the worst!< /review>< pictures>

I've never had so many packages go missing in my life. I effectively cannot have anything sent to my apartment by USPS. The customer service here is the worst I've ever experienced, at a post office or any other business. These folks make the worst DMV look like a first class establishment.< /text>

This place is the absolute worst. I stopped by to drop off a package and the line was out the door with only 1 person helping. She then left for some reason and didn’t return for 20 minutes. People were going crazy, myself included, and for the first time I realized where the phrase “going postal” came from. Avoid this branch at all costs.<//review>

are you KIDDING ME with this branch? What is up with the employees?? they're relatively nice until you ask them to do something. then they scoff, and give you bull, and look at you all weird, and they make you feel like you did something wrong. unbelievable!

additionally, their scales were off (started an investigation with USPS about this). teller 1 got me at 8.5lb, teller 2 got me at 10.1lb. i point this out to them and I AM THE ONE GETTING CRAP FROM THEM! talking to me like i did something wrong, and they weren't the ones who screwed up. then the teller (#2, i forgot her name) muttered one thing or another something about going round and round and threats that she'll send me back to teller 1. I wonder if they grasp the severity of overcharging people on 20% or more weight for WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. they were completely unfair.

How stupid can they be? I wonder when the last time it was calibrated. hey reviewers Brian and Pearline... guess what? they were nice to you because THEY WERE RIPPING YOU OFF!!!!!

I want to congratulate the genius who hired these people. they have this air of superiority, when in fact, even after a minute of being there, you can tell that they're just so stagnant and really hateful of something, not sure why...

Now that I think about it, I feel bad for them. I hope everything works out, no one deserves to be that angry. Or maybe its a game they're playing. either way im not coming back here ever again, and will be using USPS as little as possible.< /review>

<response>None<//response><text>WTF. This is the worst. Tracking states package was attempted to be shipped @ 11:26 AM on Aug 19. The mail person only shows up after 6 PM, and sometimes skips the building all together. I was at home ALL day and no one came. The message on USPS website also stated a notification was left and that it must be picked up or rescheduled. I rescheduled online for the 21st (earliest by the time I found out), there was no package delivered. Called this office, and provided tracking info, was told I'd get a call back. The following day, called back, was placed on hold for 10 minutes, and basically abandoned. Called back, person apologized a lot, and then basically told me I had to come pick it up. This may get a little crazier after I pick it up, but I had to get this out!!!!!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bba6d67e3c83:0x46c1073758a2bf14</Gmap_id>< Rating>

I have been dropping off packages 6 days a week for the last 3 years at different USPS locations. This is by far the WORST USPS I have ever been to. The employees here are ridiculous and do not get anything done. They threaten you and when you ask a question they reply back by saying " o don't get loud with me" . I am appalled at how disrespectful a certain employee was today. I will not tolerate this, and will contact the USPS police to report such terrible misconduct . If the USPS police can't do anything for the way they treated me today then I will make sure my owner lawyer contacts them and handles this. I was literally told to not come back here or they would lose my packages on purpose again. Seriously ?? What can you really say to someone after this. I hope you get what you deserve, which is to be fired RIGHT AWAY. There are many people out there who would love to have your job and would actually do their job and not be rude to your customers. I am a business owner myself, I understand that customer service is by far very stressful and annoying. You can't ever please people however you can't disrespect someone when they simply asked you a question that you could not give an answer to.I would strongly recommend anyone planning to visit this location to choose a different post office .< /text>

<Review>I've had a  PO Box since the 1970's, and I gave it up today for several reasons, almost complete lack of use but more importantly the total lack of interest by the staff to retain clients. Awful.

I have warm memories of this station but that is long faded. This place needs to be privitized.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

There isn't a single positive thing to say about this post office. Except that the homeless guys live all around there so if you are feeling charitable, you get a one-stop shop of being able to give them money  they'll probably use wastefully and you can do the same with the homeless guys as well!<//Text>

Wow is all I have to say. I understand why usps is failing. The people here are rude and lazy I called 5 times was put on hold for an hour and a half cumulatively. They can't seem to find my package. This is just pathetic! Wish I could give a negative rating!< /Text>

The worst thing about this branch is that the employees are pretty damn slow. I think they are DMV dropouts. But let's face it, in order to work at the post office all you have to have to be is at least 18 years old.
So be prepared mentally to put up with lazy slacker high school dropouts who obviously hate YOU because their life sucks.< /text>

<Date>1421784150922<//Date><rate>1<//rate><Review>Sadly, my review echoes all the other negative reviews.  The first time I walked in, one of the counter workers was busy texting on his phone, oblivious to other people behind me in line.  The postal worker who helped me was pleasant but failed to set up my PO Box properly so that despite changing my mailing address with my bank, health insurer etc., all correspondence was being returned to sender.  I figured this out after being notified by my bank after a month of paying for the damn PO box. When I went in to rectify the situation, the same postal worker exclaimed that no one bothered to affix my name to the backside of the box so mail distributors would know that indeed, the box belonged me.  At this point, she pleasantly hand wrote my name on a piece of scrap paper and told me she was going to fix the problem right then and there. Well, sure enough, I started getting my junkmail but nothing of substance and not a package that I was expecting and had been tracked as delivered.  When I went in to inquire about the package and other mail I had not received, I was told, very rudely, that I hadn't changed my mailing address with anyone! When I challenged this, I was told to stand in another line. After 5 minutes a surly worker came out and I explained that I hadn't been receiving mail other than junk mail. She went in the back and returned with a piece of mail from my healthcare group and claimed that was all that I had back there. I then told her I had been expecting a package which had supposedly been delivered days ago. She asked if I had a tracking number and when I said yes, she didn't ask what it was but instead went in the back again and a few minutes later returned with my package, opened and with the delivery date of 7 days prior written in sharpie across it   I was too stunned to do anything but inquire if there were any other things of mine back there.  Now, despite an automatic renewal on my post office box, I'm being informed by correspondents that my mail is being returned as 'addressee is unknown'.  I've just filed a complaint with the USPS and will write the Post Master General directly as management and oversight seem to be nonexistent at this branch.</Review>< pics>

<Text>If there is a hell on earth this is it's post office.  I came to pick up a package, was directed to the wrong line, stood in that line for twenty minutes before being rudely corrected.  I joined the correct line behind two women who had been waiting 30 and 45 minutes respectfully.  There was no one working at package pick-up.  The guy behind me called the USPS to file a telephone complaint and when I stepped out of line to ask for assistance (by now there were 8 of us in line), the response was 'just wait they must be at lunch'.  True but you could see several people standing around doing nothing but contemplating their navel fuzz.  After yelling back and forth we finally were helped by the rudest and meanest postal employee who acted like she was doing us a great favor by getting our packages.  All told I spent an hour in that hell... and then the USPS wonders why people don't like them!</Text><username>Jennifer Anderton< /username><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bba6d67e3c83:0x46c1073758a2bf14< /Gmap_id><Date>1389038174589<//Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

I gave the letter carrier a card to hold my mail until I returned home.  On the day I requested ALL my mail to be delivered,only the current days mail was delivered.  I called my Post Office but no one answered the telephone.  I decided to drive to the post office to collect the mail, since I expected bills that needed to be paid rather soon.
There was a long line when I arrived at the Post Office.  Often, there is a special window just to give people their mail. but I since it was closed, I assumed I would have to stand in the regular line to receive my mail.  There was no announcement to let people know that it was not possible to receive mail after 4:00 PM since Post Office hours are longer.  .
After waiting in a line with approximately 10 people in front of me, It was finally my turn to come to the window.  When I asked to pick up my mail, the employee stated,  "They close at 4:00pm."  "Come back tomorrow."   .<//text>

<text>Another den of thieves. tracking says it is delivered, but literally nowhere. package sorted at 10 in the morning, and delivered 1 minute later; meaning someone intercepted it. my apartment has security camera so I checked it everytime. they just don't carry your package if it is bigger than the mailbox. packages have been lost more than 10 times this year all by USPS, but NEVER problem with ups or fedex. especially holiday season, don't expect you can get your package. they don't even leave a red missing label either.
if you need to pick up your package, don't expect you will get out of here in 30 min. they don't seem to have a person for pick up line, and someone not busy does it. if you ask other employee, they will do nothing.
If you have something to send, just go to the corner of national and sepulveda (1 block away). there is a post outlet next to a boba cafe and liquor store. the guys working there are honest and know what they are doing<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bba6d67e3c83:0x46c1073758a2bf14</GmapID></record>

<text>The USPS has a deficit of billions of dollars, I think it is singlehandedly the fault of this one post office. It will take a package less time if you just walked it to wherever the destination is. Please use any other post office or delivery service. I'm thinking about moving just so I can have a different post office. It really is that bad.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bba6d67e3c83:0x46c1073758a2bf14<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Low life Lazy pieces of $hite, who have no customer service skills and no class at all. This is the worst Post Office by far. RUDE, LAZY, WORTHLESS. RACISM COMES IN ALL COLORS.I define them as Straight Hood Rats. If there was 0 stars that would of been more honest

By far the worst I've ever been to (and I've been to a lot).  Surly people at the counter seemingly reveling in the tremendously long lines that move glacially.  Thank God for government work.  Any and all of the people working here would have been fired long ago if this had been a real company (but then again, they probably would never have been hired in the first place).< /review>

It's not uncommon, usually once a week, no mail will be delivered--even though I normally receive mail all standard delivery days. Also, the mail rarely arrives before 5 pm and occasionally after 7.</text>

It's bee a couple hours and no call. They canceled my service and I'm not receiving mail. System could use quite an overhaul.<//Text>

A great place if you're looking, Just be careful what you say over the phone. If your mental health is questionable they will exonerate your bail. My son was suffering from P.T.S.D  They exonerated his one million dollar bail at the worst time</text>

Night shift male workers do not get back to you or are short and not very helpful or even act like they are trying to help get your loved one out. Linda is awesome! She's a daytime person and communicates well!! Follows up every morning. Some important information should be told up front and maybe more informational ads could happen.< /Text>

Bail Hotline has been beyond helpful in taking care of things when my husband went to them to bail me out! They’ve been understanding to my status of getting myself back on my feet and have worked very hard with helping me and being empathetic to my circumstances! I recommend them to anyone who needs a bail bondsman!! Raquel has been really Amazing in helping me out, as I’ve also been very pleased with the gentleman that work in the office as well!! I’d give them a perfect 5 stars, only thing is that they need to be extra staffed so that it’s not just one employee and having to be closed for at any time throughout the day!! Otherwise, I have nothing but great things to say about them!! Thank you Bail Hotline!!</text>

This place is pretty awesome! I was dreading going there. But I had to do it so....  I was greeted with a beautiful smile
and was made to feel comfortable immediately. The staff are eager to help with your situation. My staff person was
Amber E. She was very helpful in explaining the process and how things work. Amber worked with me and made sure I knew what to expect and what I needed to do. She was very kind and
and sensitive to my situation. And very professional.  Congratulations! Amber! I'm giving you and your staff 5 stars! For a job well done!<//review>

They helped me out twice they are awesome it was very quick for me to be a cosigner<//Text>
<Time>1583522678630<//Time></record></dataset><record>
<text>I would have put 5 stars but this is just the beginning of my process. But from what I've experienced already. Definitely five stars.

I want to start off by saying the service they offered was perfect for me. I was in a very stressful scenario. I feared I was going to be stuck in a bunk for way longer then I had planned for. But from word of mouth I heard very good things about them. And within a few hours, I was released.

Listen I was reading a few 1 star reviews on Yelp  before i started posting mine and after reading there opinion I have to say this.

As a person in jail and I was in a very stressful set of circumstances. I spent 3 days too long in jail. I was in need of desperate help.

This service was by far the best I could ever ask for ..."IF"... you are the actual person being bailed out. If your the co signer and you have not experienced the problems I was having. Then you can not fully understand how grateful I was for the service they provided me. So from that perspective. I will choose no other bail bondsman from this point on. Thank you.

Update:

After reading what I put it was true for the time. But after I try to call them and get bailed out again, they showed me no love. I had to get my mom to bail me out from a different place because they wouldn't help me the second time. If you're an emergency and you have a job and you have no cosigner they help me the first time only. Don't expect any love second time around I say 3 stars.</text>< user_id>

<time>1584090935277<//time><rate>1<//rate><Review>Horrible place, do not risk your loved ones to this fraud company. After you pay suddenly people from different numbers on recorded lines, call you saying you owe money trying to lure you to admit you owe money then force you to pay more money. Next instead of issuing a letter to reinstate your bail if you accidentally missed a court date, they turn you in themselves from the office. And to make things even worse they charge you for having to arrest you while you voluntarily showed up to their office and already have a new court date on the same day. They purposely hold you in the office to make you miss the court and bail out on your loved one. Then make you pay for a whole new bail.
Just a note the people in the office themselves are nice people, the company itself is who is the fraud.
Add on 3 years later this fraud company suddenly creates new files and has other people reach out to you claiming you owe money. They are scammers, keep your personal information safe do not hire this fraudulent company. The others may charge more but none of them keep on coming back to scam you for more money .</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>If your looking for support during a stressful time and a team of real people willing to work with you not against you then I suggest BailHotLine. I called in stressed and honestly with no hope. I heard the number 250 thousand and thought how could I afford this? I called in anyways praying for a miracle. Amber picked up and I’m sure she could hear the stress in my voice. She immediately  reassured me that everything would be ok she told me 250 thousand was an intimidating number but that they would work with me and discuss an affordable payment plan. That’s exactly what they did. I was able to get my son home safe where he belongs with the help of bailhotline Thank You guys And special thanks to Amber for all the support and comfort you gave our family!< /review>< Pictures>

Rebecca D. And Bryan are amazing! I have worked with Bail Hotline for several years and every time I have needed them they have worked with me and provided stellar service. I highly recommend Bail Hotline whether it's your frist time dealing with the law or whether you're experienced; they work swiftly to reunite you with your loved ones. Placing your trust and confidence with Bail Hotline San Jose is definitely a safe bet, if not the best.< /Review>

<Text>😀Rebecca Pequeno in The San Jose office has been more than helpful and accommodating with my bail and my payment plan. When I went to court and got remanded😬 I was out within 6 hours because Rebecca was on it💯percent as soon as it happened. I highly recommend👍 this office and team of bail agents  if you ever need bail or need to bail someone out..<//Text>< Pictures>

Thanks Rebecca D. for making this uncomfortable situation into something more comfortable and easy to understand. I took away one star due to slight miscommunications between the San Jose office and the main office.</Review>

They were a little slow getting started, but in all fairness they were packed with a 45 minute wait. It was well worth it! The food was delicious, though I can't get behind brussel sprouts and sushi combined. Still, my friend liked that and I liked most else. Fresh fish, right rice ratio, and helpful staff. Highly recommend.</Text>

I used to go before pandemic and the service & food is always great.  However, last night, everything got worst, service is too slow and the food is totally a mess. They served the rolls broken pieces and the rice is too much wherein it's overflowing.  My wife got sick when we got home.  Will stop going here, sorry guys, you lost one loyal customer!</Review>

Place used to be great. Not anymore.
Baked mussels full of sand and shell pieces. Cold and not that fresh. Quality of sushi keeps getting worse. And they don't give you wassabi and ginger with takeout orders.<//Text>

<Text>I visited May 2 2021 and ordered the Spicy Albacore plus Spicy Yellowtail. The cold unfiltered Nigori complemented my meal. Service was ok but will improve once staff figures the post Pandemic plan. I will return to see progress. 😀</Text>< Pics>

<review>Delicious sushi at very reasonable prices. The to go service is lacking. I always call in ahead but every time I show up its 5-10min before someone comes out to help me and another 5-10min to bring out my food. It's never fast and alot of waiting. I continue to come back because the good is good and worth the wait:)</review>< Pics>

Wow if you are a sushi lover this is your spot.  Very fresh and tasty sushi.  All you can eat . Amazing service from all the staff.  Very nice people.  Restaurant is very clean including the bathrooms.  They are taking covid precautions aswell including having the distance on tables. You must also get the green tea ice cream so delicious.  Our server was John he was very nice and professional energetic and every suggestion was right on the spot.  His enthusiasm definitely wants me to come back.</Review>

Amazing food. Excellent quality.
See my "Philadelphia Serrano Roll" photo.
Full of avocado yumness, you won't regret.

They are fast, ready on the move if you plan.

Courteous and friendly every single time. I've been here about a dozen passes, excellent service every time.

Thank you for being the best sushi spot I know around me. A+<//Review>

This is one of the best sushi places in the valley. The AYCE is excellent with a wide range of selections that are all fresh and made to order. Must try all their appetizers and sushi.

Everything we have tried has tasted great and we have been over 6 times, call ahead for larger groups since it does get busy. The service is top notch and everyone is very friendly.

Plenty of parking in the plaza, but it is a bit hard to find. Find the dollar store, they are next door.</Review>

Woaaaahh! Surpassed my expectations for its category of lower end sushi. This place used nothing but fresh ingredients tonight. The fish quality is above average for the price point and it's 50% off right now!!

Make sure to call to place your order, the 50% is for takeout orders only. Call under the "questions" phone number because Grubhub takes a cut when you call the number to place an order.

Highly recommended!

Rolls:

-Mango Salmon
-Dragon
-Hawaain roll

Each box comes with a sesame sauce, ginger and wasabi.

Also, don't miss out on the baby lobster roll! It's grossly oily but it's really good!<//Review>

<text>Received some outstanding service from Edenlynn (unsure of spelling).  The place was super busy but she handled our order perfectly and checked on us several times to refresh our drinks and order round two of more sushi. ACYE sushi, two bottles of Nigori, and three large bottles of Asahi came to $110 before tip. All was delicious and worth the price.<//text>< pics>

Best Sushi restaurant in San Fernando Valley! Maru sushi is simply amazing , nothing short of great! They have 50% off their rolls during the pandemic and in all honesty this is major discount. Maru’s customer service is also unmatched thank you maru!</Review>

Nothing beats the price and quality for this AYCE sushi place! I have been here twice and enjoyed both times. Sadly, my favorite chef went elsewhere but the food was still delicious. The service is excellent as well. $29 pp with sashimi included. Recommend trying this spot for good quality without breaking the bank.</Text>

<Review>By far the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to. You don't need to spend hundred to get fresh good quality sushi. Just visit Maru, price is ridiculously good. And you get a small and dedicated menu with intricate, detail oriented, dishes that will blow your taste buds. Everything from appetizers to their sashimi is just spectacular. My boss and I are here several times a month. We can never get enough< /Review><response>None<//response>< Time>

Always my go to spot when I'm in SF. Never disappoints though the food is pricey, but you get what you pay for. I always order the spicy tuna roll and the fried tofu. Long lines but if you go early and get your name on the list, it isn't so bad (just don't go with a large party). I have waited outside before opening time once, for dinner, and got seated ASAP. Neat little "underground" sushi bar in the city that feels more unique than other sushi restaurants. A must try.</review>

<Text>One star and here is why? All they care is about walk in customers and tables. They don't treat well Online orders, pickup and takeout. They need to improve their management attitude. If they tell you 10 minutes you will end up waiting 30 minutes outside the door.< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
A good hand roll needs to be eaten immediately after it's made otherwise the seaweed softens.  The combination of a crisp seaweed, warm rice and fresh fish result in the perfect bite.  I made the realization while at a sushi restaurant.  My friend declared, "from now on, I will only order hand-rolls at the bar, this is soggy!"<//review>

<Review>Delicious sushi, which says a lot from someone that doesn't usually like it! Excellent service. If. You're really lucky, you'll get Eunice, who was a wonderful server. Desert was great too!
We had all you can eat dinner. I liked it their tea mug and Mason jar for iced tea.</Review>< Pics>

Simple menu, good service, good prices, good food. The line sometimes gets too long, but if you're okay with waiting, this is a great spot for quality handrolls in DTLA.</text>

<Review>Look no further for amazing sushi experiences! From the broth and ramen, to the veggies and tempura, and finally the sushi it's self everything is delicious. The owners are amazing and the green tea is amazing! My mother doesn't usually like sushi and she can't stop coming here. MARU SUSHI RULES!< /Review>< gmapID>

<Time>1524512744612</Time><rate>4< /rate><Text>I discovered this place after shopping at the Ralph's next door and was excited to see a new AYCE sushi spot! The vibe is very modern with about 12-15 tables as well as a sushi bar. There are multiple TVs on the wall so you can catch a game here. The service was great, the place isn't too big so the servers are very attentive. The quality of the sushi is good also, most sushi spots will stuff the nigiri pieces with more rice, but it's the exact opposite here! The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is the specialty roll selection isn't as big as other places. But as a new place, I'm sure they will expand the offerings eventually!</Text>< pics>

! The food that was prepared in front of us was absolutely delicious. The chefs that worked are table were very talkative, friendly and entertaining. The place is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.fffffff< /Text>

I did the all you can eat for $29 per person. Definitely worth it. Sushi is fresh. I like that they give you very little rice relative to the amount of fish. There's a wide variety of sushi, rolls, and other dishes. Plenty of parking with good service. No attitude. The server is all spoken English well. I would definitely go again.<//text>

The food is excellent and the environment is very inviting.  The staff is friendly and soft music plays in the background.  The service is fast so be aware that if you order a lot on the first round, you may not have enough room on your table to fit all the dishes if you are there with a group of poeple ☺<//review>

They offer an awesome all you can eat option for $30 a person but also your standard per roll option which is good too. The prices are very good for the high quality sushi you get. The Sashimi is really good and the rolls pack great flavor. Everything was so fresh and clean and the service was amazing. This is going to be my new go to sushi place!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>There's a not enough nice things I could say about this place. 1st of all the services exceptional, I happen to get one of the greatest sushi chefs that I've had in all of my sushi X ranges. He was creative the fish was fresh the prices were good and the atmosphere was wonderful. I can't wait to return to this place and so glad the Chatsworth has a yummy sushi restaurant right around the corner.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I heard about this place from a friend who worked with the chef, Kevin, at his old job. Cannot say enough amazing things about this place, guys! The food was absolutely amazing, and the service. My boo and I ordered a little too much food, (and be warned it is AYCE so anything you don't finish you will be charged, but will get a to go box) but did not mind taking the food home because how delicious it was. The presentation was just WOW, and the vibe from the restaurant was mellow and good in general. DEFINITELY recommend it!!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c29cb6ef286819:0xa54f87766b74ad1b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Their sauces for the gyoza, shishito peppers and sunshine roll were each very flavorful and complimentary to each dish. I would give a 5 however my order was a to go order.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>This all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant offers a sleek format of ordering food by a slip of paper while also managing to somehow dish out amazing food at a fast rate. The sushi chefs exhibit a great performance and presentation while working at the bar, in sight of everyone in the restaurant. The dark interior, combined with low lighting and sunlight, creates a cozy atmosphere and allows us to focus on the taste of the food. This restaurant deserves 5 stars< /review>< Pics>

This is my 3rd time here. Never again. I usually go to Hikari and when I have tried to give Maru a chance something always goes wrong. They only have two servers, the chefs kept my all you can eat order form and we waited a very long time. Finally complained and ordered my round two BUT to go. They need to hire more servers. This is very unprofessional and not fair to customers not the two servers they have their busting their behinds. Ridiculous!</review>

UPDATE:
Tried this place again on a Tuesday. It was not busy, we were seated immediately and got helped pretty quick. Service was a lot better since it wasn't busy, sushi was flavorful and fresh. Its was a lot better than my last visit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sushi here was just okay. Flavor was a bit plain compared to other AYCE sushi. I felt like this location needed more texture as most of there rolls seem mushy, plain and not flavorful. The albacore with the crispy onions on top was the only one I liked. They give you a small dessert (green tea, if you asked) but, gave it to me in a really broke plastic dish and ended up not eating it. Like how do you serve this to your customer!?

Service here was horrible as we did come in on a Tuesday and it was busy. The table next to us was seated after us and got served food immediately like 4 times. Our food took a while to come & refill other than water wouldn't come around as so often (I had just hot water w/lemon).

Overall, we were patient and just wanted to enjoy ourselves for dinner that night. Left the girls a nice tip but, that would probably be my first and last time there.< /review>

<Review>Well for starters we were seated in the corner with speakers blasting Asian bubble gum music. The service was somewhat ok and I mean somewhat my wife’s salmon was very salty, very hard probably been in freezer too long and the waiter just hung out with his Japanese friend in the next booth just jabbing away in Japanese . My Chirashi was very bland and the fish was warm what an experience !! Never to return I doubt they’ll last they try to rope us into going for their $29.00 all you can eat thank God we decline very sad experience</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Our go to ayce sushi spot in the valley. Typically ayce sushi places put out the best quality of fish within the first few months of their grab opening but I can confidently say that they've kept up their quality after roughly a year of opening.

Fast service and great sushi for ayce. Easily a single star above Hikari, down the street, on freshness and fish:rice ratio.</Text><user_id>115277565246152426019<//user_id><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Wow an unbelievable experience. After a horrible experience the opening week. (Bad service and subpar sushi) we decided to give our new local business another chance. Basically refused to serve us at a table since our 5 year old only eats teriyaki chicken (anyone who has a kid can relate) and that's not on all you can eat menu. After talking to owner they still refused table service unless we all had all you can eat. They wanted us to sit at the bar with a 5 year old. Walked out never to return again.< /Review>

< Review>
This is a new AYCE sushi restaurant that we heard good things about, and boy was it good! This place is just down the street from our main sushi spot Hikari and we wanted to see how it stacked up. As far as AYCE places usually go, the fish had the best temperature, texture, and taste. The fish to rice ratio was just right, not too much or too little of anything. The selection of sushi is not as extensive as other places but the selection they do have is top notch quality.

The only knock I can give them is that a few of their rolls and nigiri are just drenched with whatever sauce comes with them. Not a big problem,I can just ask for less sauce on them.

All in all, very surprised. The location is hidden away behind a gym which worries me because I hope it doesn't close down on account  of the location like the other businesses before them. I'll definitely help them out by coming as often as me and my wallet allows!</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>New sushi bar in town.  Tried it with my family and it definitely beat my expectation.  The closest comparison for the All You Can Eat style is Hakari.  This place blows Hakari out of the water in terms of quality and atmosphere.  If you are looking for an intimate Omikaze style this place isn't it.  If you're looking for a daily driver that won't break the bank try Maru sushi.  As it stands this is my go to sushi spot.< /Review>< Pictures>

THIS IS THE WORST SUSHI EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. FOR THE FIRST
TIME I WENT THERE WITH MY LADY AT 815 PM AS WE ARRIVED I ASKED THE HOSTESS IF
I COULD TRY THEIR ALL YOU CAN EAT AND IF
MY LADY CAN ORDER A LA CARTE. SHE REPLIED IN A VERY RUDE TONE AND UGLY
BODY LANGUAGE AND SAID NO EITHER ALL YOU CAN EAT OR A LA CARTE. WE ORDERED ALL YOU CAN EAT THE FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE AR BEST. THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE AND TO TOP IT ALL THEY TOLD ME I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE LEFT OVER FOOD. THIS OWNERSHIP IS VERY FAR AWAY FROM HOSPITALITY AND ENTERTAINMENT . HE SHOULD OPEN A JAIL
AND CALL IT MARU CHATSWORTH ARREST CENTER. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS STUPID ESTABLISHMENT TO ANYONE GO TO HIKARI INSTEAD. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST EVER. BEYOND IMAGINATION.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is a great restaurant where you can taste Japanese food properly. The clean and friendly service, a variety of sushi and fantastic rolls, taste good and enjoy watching the food, so I am happy while eating. It was so delicious that I forgot to take a picture.
I highly recommend it.

일식 제대로 맛 볼 수 훌륭한 식당입니다. 청결하며 친절한 서비스, 다양한 스시와 환상적인 롤, 맛도 좋고 음식을 보는것도 즐거워 먹는 동한 행복합니다. 너무 맛있어서 사진 찍는것을 잊어버렸다.
강력히 추천합니다.< /Review><user>117045374360423537683<//user><user_name>Jim KC</user_name><Response>None</Response><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

The ice cream tastes all right. Nothing to special. They are about five bucks each. Atleast when I went. I've had similar ice cream for less.<//text>

This ice cream shop sells the best ice cream I have ever tasted in my life! It is made with fresh, high quality ingredients. The portions are SUPER generous and the prices are cheap. You won't find ice cream like this anywhere else.  If you like super sweet ice cream this place isn't for you though.  The sweetness level is just enough and it doesn't overpower any of the other ingredients.  I had the nut variety flavor and it had full chunks of real pecans, walnuts,  peanuts. I found a piece of heaven in this ice cream shop!< /Text>

The food is high quality, fresh, and made from scratch. I also like the fact that I am supporting a local business. True authentic Mexican food. Better than the typical chain restaurants. 5 stars all day.< /review>

Love this place, they sale the best ice cream in Orange County real fruit, great variety good price I drive 12 miles to get this ice cream is worth it they have all different kinds of Mexican fruits flavors, Olli is not even compared to la michoacana Mexican ice cream I personally don't like that place is expensive and they claim to have natural flavor but they are not 100% natural.</Review>

<review>I was staying in a motel next to the restaurant and looked them up and tried calling to place a order before they closed (it was 10 mins to 9 on Saturday night)  thought I would call my order in so they could make it fast and not stay late because I walked over. Well no answer so I walked over and it's now 8:55 I walked in and they told me were closed and refused to just make me a burrito.  I worked in a Mexican restaurant like this one and I would have been fired for turning a customer away when the sign on the door states we are open till 9pm and they are there before even one min before 9pm you help them!!! Won't try going there again!!!!!< /review><rate>2</rate>< Resp>

So I wanted to order lunch; a burrito and a soda, and they tell me it's a $10 minimum to use their ATM...  Really?!?  I don't eat $10 worth of food unless its at some expensive restaurant.  I just wanted to have lunch!!  So I went to Alberto's instead and they were happy to take my money, even if it was only for a $6.50 order.  If they charged me an extra 50 cents or a dollar to use my ATM I would not have minded, but to say you have to spend $10 when you're the only one ordering is ridiculous.

I think the prior reviews are for the wrong place 'cause they only accept cash here and don't serve food and ... this place has by far the best ice cream and nieve ever! It reminds me of being in Mexico. I always take paletas de limón home with me to eat later! It's amazing!<//text>

(Translated by Google) The variety of flavors is wide and the flavor is very rich. The attention is friendly, the owner is very attentive. There is no toilet service. You will find snow, popsicles (water and milk), smoothies, waterfalls, fruit with snow, chetos with cheese, scraped snow, banana split, milkshakes, flakes, etc.

(Original)
La variedad de sabores es amplia y el sabor es muy rico. La atención es amable, la dueña es muy atenta. No hay servicio de sanitarios. Encontraras nieves, paletas (de agua y leche), smoothies, cascadas, fruta con nieve, chetos con queso,nieves raspadas, banana split, malteadas, escamochas, etc.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Sad mind does not know what a Bionico pineapple, strawberry, melon and granola is. Yogurt will save nothing, I will not return. A Raspado de Tamarindo, with chili because it tastes nothing like Tamarindo I will definitely not pay $ 15 again for something that has no flavor

I came here planning to do some outdoor dining, however changed my mind and ordered takeout instead. The restaurant is inside a strip mall in the corner. There are about 4 tables outside and they are poorly lit. One table that was available was really close to the parking lot and I can see and hear all the cars driving by. Lots of cars also made a stop by that corner for people running in to pick up their order. I thought it was best to order takeout since it wasn’t the atmosphere I was hoping for. I waited almost an hour for my food to be ready. Two tables sat down after I placed my order and they received their food before I did. The sushi here wasn’t anything amazing. The wasabi was especially bad.< /Text>

Although I'd heard the service was bad, it was actually fine. The low stars are for the quality of the fish, which was horrible. Everything had a fishy taste and all the sashimi that should melt in your mouth was chewy and gross. I'm really sad because we live nearby and it would be nice to have another sushi place to frequent. Also, I used to go here a lot several years ago and it used to be decent. Husband was just glad it didn't give us food poisoning. We ordered the Lover's Delight.< /Review>

<Text>This site is my favorite site.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. Whenever  I feel like having a good dinner, this place comes first to my mind. superb and many types of  food and a large list of dishes.trained team, and pleasant vibes. In addition to that, the pay is good. I praise this spot with no doubt.<//Text>< name>

Hands down best sushi I’ve ever had. If you’re looking for quality sushi with generous portions, this is the place to go. Owners are friendly and kind, the food is delicious, and the place is clean.<//text>

I've passed this 'whole in the wall' Sushi establishment an innumerable amount of times but never have I eaten there, until yesterday. A large group of my friends, and I ate there for lunch. The vibe there felt pleasant, the staff was kind, restrooms appeared clean, the menu had food priced fairly, and the food was delicious. Am I going there again? "Is the Pope Catholic?"
No wonder it's call, Ichiban. Try, a lunch selection, along with one item. I chose the tempura shrimp.< /text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>Tried this place at a friend’s place via food delivery. Rather disappointing.

The Hamachi Maki was supposed to have green onion in it; but came with none. Lemon slices on the 49er Roll were small and thick, and had seeds in them. Philadelphia Roll had more cream cheese than salmon. Alaska Roll had only a little bit of avocado and tobiko. Salmon Skin Roll would probably do better without the sweet sauce. Carrots in the tempura looked like half of the carrot was just chopped off and thrown into the batter; and they were half cooked.

All in all, not worth the price, and not a restaurant I would recommend.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8GvxVQGsCY_wbEwgCQloJ1wWuUvOhaFSoaSP_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyF0m5wOug4zRbxdNIvZdXgZ2-u7NQ0CjbGr6j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBco1krjpMo6A-g0FgjJxlNAD7FPC1Tq07g5IS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Their octopus balls with shaved fish was yummy. The sauces were really good and they had cold bottled tea. I ordered a $3 lemon tea and he brought me a sweetened green tea instead. There is a TV with cartoons on and it kept a kid at a neighboring table very entertained while we ate our meal.<//Text>< user_id>

<Review>The food here is great in general. Sometimes one of their waiters are on shift, usually weekdays, who has less enthusiasm but besides that staff is very sociable. I haven't tried all their offerings but their meats match the requests of the customer 9/10 times.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Bland taste to the ramen dish I had, and the toppings were few in number. I went hungry again after 30 mins.

My boyfriend asked for a dish in a vegetarian version (something very simple. A serving of steamed rice, a sauce in a bowl and then chicken), and the waitress kept saying they didn't have tofu. Even though it was on the menu!

My boyfriend referred to the menu, even pointed it out. And she still said no. He then asked her again, and she said he could only have tofu if he chose another dish.

One of the chefs overheard it and said "of course we can do that dish with tofu".

Won't be coming back.<//Review><Rate>2<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Food was delicious, but table & floor was sticky. Normally I wouldn't mind, but we sat in the table with a step up & then sit down into a bench with a step down under the table. Keep in mind we had to take off our shoes. So, having a sticky floor is not a great feeling.< /review>

The sushi was fair, about as good as I would have made had I purchased the materials more cheaply myself. My bill was roughly 200% greater than what I had expected given the prices on the menu, and when I asked in as nicely a manner as I could, to see an itemized bill, my friends and I discovered interesting charges for unlabeled phantom food and a hefty "tax".

The waitress publicly argued with the patrons next to us regarding what they had ordered, which was a fair source of entertainment, but not enough for me to consider coming back... ever... with anyone... ... even if they're paying.</text>

<text>We came here on a Saturday afternoon since we were nearby and most other Japanese restaurants were closed at this time (around 3pm).

I ordered Tonkatsu ramen with spicy tuna rolls and it was yummy. My only issue is that their spicy tuna roll came with avocado and cucumber. I don't like any of those and the menu item did NOT specify those items next to spicy tuna roll.

All in all, this is a reasonably priced place with good food. I would come here again!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I got salmon nigiri, the alaska roll, and the shrimp tempura roll to go. While I waited, I was even given some green tea to warm up. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. And the sushi! Reasonably priced and delicious. They do a good job here.
If I'm ever in the area again for work, I will definitely stop by.<//Review>

The price is very reasonable and portions are in good size, not to mention the freshness of the food,  do not expect much of the customer service, they don't speak much English,  which is not a matter they really know what they are doing and they are nice. Great Food with an excellent price!</Review>< Pictures>

The sushi is just OK, but they are soooo Rude!  And do not honor their "gift cards", with so many sushi places to choose from, you would think they would be a bit nicer.  Kobe Sake right next door and they are soo nice and excellent sushi.  Poor customer service at Ichi ban.  I will NEVER go back!  So if you want to be treated rudely this is the place for you!</text>

This was my first time axe-throwing and I was honestly very surprised to have an amazing experience!
My two biggest concerns before coming here were [1] Lack of outdoor space as this place seemed indoors from the pictures and [2] potentially heavy weight axes would mean that this experience would soon get tiring!

I’m happy that both of my concerns turned out to be false alarms! While this place is partially indoors, they’ve opened up the doors on both sides thereby allowing plenty of air circulation. Also, you can be masked while throwing the axes thereby making this a safe experience!

With regards to the axes, they have a pretty huge selection of axes ranging from lightweight to moderate and then the more heavier ones! Surprisingly none of the axes were as heavy and once our trainers taught us the right technique, it was smooth sailing from there!

In terms of logistics, there’s plenty of parking available. Besides axe throwing, you can also order drinks and beers. It’s worth noting that all slots start and stop at the same time and are 1:15 hours long ! If you’re certain that you’re not gonna be able to make it in time for your reservation, I’d call the place up and try to reschedule instead of coming in midway through your slot.

Highly highly recommend this experience especially with a larger group of friends !< /text>

<Text>Super fun and unique experience. I’d never tried it before and was nervous at the beginning but after awhile we got the hang of it. It does get a bit hot inside on warm days but that would really be my only critique.< /Text>< Time>

Fun place to spend couple hours.
People here are very friendly and they share with you how to throw the axe, and also the walk around to coach you on how to do it better.
It’s actually much harder than I thought. Hi it pretty fun :)</Text>

Finally decided to try this place out for date night!  It was so much fun and easy to learn.  The staff were friendly and helpful- great training!  Highly recommend going here,  can't wait for the next time!   It's humid but they open the doors and have fans.< /review>

Had a great team building experience with my coworkers.  We wanted to try something all of us had never done before.  The proprietors demonstrated some techniques to achieve a "stick".  They also shared safety protocols.  They were covid safe, had a couple of very large fans circulating air and doors at the front and back always open.  Had lots of different size axes to try.  Lots of fun!  Would do again.</review>

We had some problems with booking online, it set up a appointment at the Berkley site in stead of San Jose. The team and management there was great, they hopped on the situation and fixed the issue for us. The place was a blast, rock music playing, smiling faces every where we looked. We even spent a little extra and bought the Bleeding clown target. That target is a game changer for axe throwing.

I most defiantly will be back, this place was fun. even with the sore arm the next day.< /review>

You don't have to be an athlete to enjoy chucking sharp objects at walls! I had a blast at Axeventures. At the beginning, a staff member much pluck and panache gave us a tutorial and taught us how to throw safely. We were lousy so she kindly gave us further pointers. With her help I was able to sink a few axes in the target. There was no snobbery, only an invitation to have a great time and laugh at yourself. The venue is small but comfy. Looks a bit like a garage. It is well lit and set up with chain-link walls to prevent any rogue axes from flying too far. Great place! I wish them success.< /text>

SO HAPPY about this great addition to San Jose! This place is so much fun! The staff is attentive and friendly, the decor and vibe is great, and the music definitely adds to the experience! There are also so many axes to choose from! This is a great place to come with big groups or even just a nice date night! Can't wait to come back!< /text>

We had a family fun outing even though my 8 yr old would make me nervous when he would throw his axe. We did receive great instructions to start us off in the beginning. It is done in a group setting. Most customers were wearing masks. I felt safe with the wonderful ventilation. I do recommend this place for a new and exciting time. It is something different. Lucca was awesome with giving us tips for a better throw, history about some of the axes and he has competed in axe throwing before so he just enhances the overall experience. There are light snacks such as chips and bottled soda & drinks. No alcohol but not sure if that would be a good idea with axes being thrown. It was fun and we will be back!< /Text>

Highly recommend booking a few lanes for your upcoming post-vaccination group activity!

-Coaches are friendly and offer great guidance and tips
-Ample space in the cages and 10+ lanes
-A lot of seats and tables setup right by the lanes to congregate as you wait for your turn
-Restrooms are clean, well-lit AND well-maintained!!! (+2 stars just for that alone)
-For those who are itching to update your social media feeds after social distancing for 14+ months, you have a dope mural, several neon signs and a plant wall to take your photos with.<//Review>

<Text>Such a fun experience! Definitely going back, and definitely recommend. Pricing is decent, especially for the amount of time you get, tutorial is brief but they are constantly walking around and watching people who need extra pointers. Pricing for the bleeding poster is a bit excessive, but it's a pretty fun challenge!<//Text>< time>

I like this place it has that hippie environment I got some copper bracelets for my daughter and friend and a necklace that had like a clear rock with a flower inside for my daughter they have lots of random stuff in there blankets,  cups there's so much in a little bit of everything even dreamcatchers and paintings. The staff is super friendly</Review>

<review>I love shopping here even when I don't buy anything and I love how friendly the staff is but most importantly I love the positive energy you feel when you walk in and the wonderful smell from the oil diffuser. I always forget to ask the cashier what oils they use.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Still love this store, though I noticed they don't have half the aromatherapy they once had. Seems they took out quite a bit of stuff to keep it from being so crowded inside, it's easier to navigate now without knocking things over. That's the up side. I've never been in here that I didn't fall in love with the staff. Always such friendly upbeat people.<//text>

Love this place! I hate the mall, so I have never been here before, but my aunt bought me a gift card to their store. I absolutely loved everything in the store. Lots of metaphysical items, real Crystal's, tapestries, jewelry, wind chimes... oh I found Guatemala worry dolls there too! Haven't seen those since I was a little girl. The woman and man working the cash register were super nice and helpful, very personable. Loved the vibe and feeling I got from this store.</Text>

Awesome place. A little pricey, but you can't find many "open" spiritual stores in Bakersfield.  I recommend taking a look.< /Text>

Fast friendly service. Decent prices. This is homemade food and it feels like their family is sharing it with their guests. Chicken quesadilla platter served with rice and beans and chips and pickled jalapenos w carrots. Just the right portion to not feel overly stuffed.<//review>

Second time coming here and the food doesn't disappoint me. The food is great. Asada quesadilla with salad was good. The tripa from here is delicious, grilled to perfection. Pastor tacos were great too. Friendly staff, makes you feel welcomed. Definitely will go back again.<//review>

Probably one of the top tacos stands that I've been to. The services given by Chui are phenomenal. The meat is really tasty and well prepare. Free parking onsite and very nice environment to eat.<//review>

<review>Every time I visit, the portions are different, usually smaller, they are "out" of something basic, the meal looks nothing like the picture of the thing on their board or menu.

When you ask for a particular sauce that they've had that you like, there's always an issue with getting it... they need to make it, they don't have the ingredients, "I'm going to have to charge you x extra for that", in a scolding tone, as if I'm asking for something that I shouldn't, and need to prepare for a punishment.

Payment: Everything is super expensive for the size of the meal here. EVERYTHING.
And if you pay cash, make sure you have change, because they NEVER do and always need to "run next door" to the convenience store and beg them to break a bill or something.

Completely unprofessional, and with all of these things, one wonders about consistency in food prep safety.

I quit going there, because it always seemed like a TASK to deal with their never ending issues and surprises.

Go to Del Taco, at least there they make your food the same every time, and the price is good.< /review>< Resp>

Solid taco place. I really enjoyed the tripas and lengua in particular. Combo the cilantro sauce with the spicy green on your taco for a great time.</Review>

Honest, tasty food at fair prices.  Depending on the day,  the service/food can be inconsistent but I don't think I've ever gone to any authentic taqueria regularly where this hasn't been true.  80 percent of the time it's a hit so 4 stars.< /text>< Pictures>

A hidden gem. The staff is always friendly, and for $6, you can get an absolutely awesome carne asada burrito con todos. I haven't tried much else there, but it is definitely a go-to spot for when I need to grab something quick when I'm working.<//Review>

An absolute hidden gem. This place is too good.
One of the best tacos i have tried for a while. I ordered 6 tacos, carne asada and tripa. It was delicious. They even have burgers and pizza here. The place is pretty small but its legit. They cook all the tacos when you order them. Fresh out of the grill. Hot and tasty. You must must~~~ try their tacos. Will be back again for sure~!!</Text>

<review>Why this place isn't on a best taco list, I don't know. My wife and I eat there a couple times a week. The carne asada taco with Chuy's sauces are to die and go to heaven. The prices are right, they're open til 10pm, but closed Sunday. I keep wanting to try one of their pizzas but I never get past ordering tacos.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Staff was very accommodating, and treated my party like family. There were three sides presented to us in addition to our entree, and there were no weak links. Well balanced portions with great flavor and consistency. Back patio has a pleasant urban ambiance. Will definitely be returning regularly!< /Review>< user_name>

<text>I went with my whole family
Our first impression was that the entrance was non appealing, we sat down and saw how they are truly good people and kind hearted with great customer service.
I love their food and it was very tasty! Reminded me of the food I used to eat back home. The chief really likes his job and is also willing to have you eat all of his food just to make you try it. I would definitely recommend it and I will go back again 👌< /text>< name>

Amazing food, very generous offering
It is authentic middle eastern food. It's not expensive either. I'll visit the  place multiple times. Just a 7 min walk from the El cajon transit center</Text>

What wonderful home cooking, and such nice people. Syria is famous in the Arab world for its food. And this restaurant reflects that. I had a super delicious falafel, rolled in flat bread (not stuffed in Pita), and it fulfilled all my dreams. First and foremost, the falafels themselves were moist, flavorful,  and had the fragrance and taste of mild spices like Coriander, not overwhelmed by too much cumin. There was the perfect ratio of tomato, lettuce, cucumber, pickle and tahina, and i think i tasted some parsley in there. The last time I can remember truly being this happy with falafel was a family run Palestinian place in San Francisco, 19th St. Inner Sunset, 1992, where the owner's grandfather introduced me patiently to the great's of modern Arab music in the days of cassettes.

I also got hummus, mashed eggplant salad, stuffed grape leaves, and kibbeh take away, all of which were excellent as well. Also got two things I did not catch the name of, one a lovely milky pudding desert, the other savory rice and peas inside a baked filo dough that had the taste of butter and also pistachio, unusual and very very good.  Found some good prices on some groceries, too. Two thumbs up!

This is a small place with enough tables, and even though not fancy is still very pleasant, in part b/c of the very nice owners, from Syria and Nebraska, respectively.  I cant wait to go back!<//Text>

You know she may not have been having a good day which is fine, we all have them and the pandemic has been going on too long for my liking I get it! But let’s keep continuing having our masks on and push forward to getting back to normal soon! I still love you guys and I’ll continue coming again!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Normally I really enjoy 😋going to Dutch Bros and I like their coffee and brand. However, my experience at this location was that the team was doing much more talking than working😞, and this created a longer wait than usual and a frustratingly long line. I saw the coffees I ordered just sitting waiting to be served but the drive thru window worker just kept chatting away with the car in front of me. Chipper attitudes and friendliness go a long way and customers appreciate that, but we also ultimately expect a reasonably fast coffee experience and attention to the orders we have paid for. 😕😞<//text>

< Review>
Great coffee and speciality treats, will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth!  Fun little shop and nice workers but please stop asking for a tip when I'm just grabbing coffee or when I haven't been served yet (didn't even get my order right but they ask for a tip first) haha still would reccomend because its definitely a gem! 💎 🤍<//Review>

Wowza, what lovely workers, amazing drink menu, and such speedy and efficient times that drinks go out heh! I’m so sorry as I have forgotten her name and wish desperatelyI could remember but one time at this location, they were not accepting credit cards and my mom whom I was with at the time only had cash on her, however when we told this particular employee she actually payed for both of our drinks on her! I sincerely and greatly thank whoever she is, you deserve a massive raise and it truly reflects just how kind and pleasant their employees are here! 💞<//text>

<Text>I am severely disappointed. I have been a huge fan of Dutch Bro's since I move to Cali. Today they were using their double lane and having some trouble figuring it out. I had pulled in and was told to move to the other side. When I got the girl told me to pull ahead and started taking orders of people who were behind me and whom arrived after me. I was perturbed but still had my place in line. She came back and started taking my order. I questioned why people who arrived after me were getting their orders taken first. Her response is "oh we have to flip flop". I informed her that I had been here first and was waiting to order longer than those other vehicles. The other vehicles had now started pulling ahead of me. She then asked what I wanted. I decided to leave. I will sadly not be back to Dutch Bro's until they figure out the line management and how to take orders as they arrive.<//Text>< resp>

This place is great! The coffee is great, a little on the side of high priced but the youthful and energetic staff are a true testament to customer service. They are always in a great mood and can lift the spirits of even the most downtrodden. If you want a pick me up, both in body, mind and spirit, check out Dutch Bros!</Review>

It's definitely changed over the years and I don't know how I feel about it.. there are some people that have the Dutch culture in them and others that don't know what they are doing.. it's sad to see people that obviously don't want to be there when the company is such a great one to work for..</Review>

<Text>I used to dislike Dutch Bros. I think I was just ordering the wrong thing. That was before I checked out all the flavor combos they have on the website.

Where do I even start? This drive thru is AMAZING!!! My family drove thru and the employees were super friendly and enthusiastic. It was our first time there and we signed up for a membership because why not?  I ordered the Italian Soda in after cool I believe. It was so good and very refreshing. If you need some great coffee Dutch Bros is the place to go.<//Review>

My favorite coffee place and I rarely drink coffee!  They craft each cup of coffee with quality ingredients and craftsmanship.  Delicious coffee without the acidity.</Text>

The wonderful employees at dutch brothers always make my day. everyone is just so nice, and they make our drinks extra sweet how I like! My wife Karen used to get the double chocolate mocha.  We used to drive through a couple times a week, but it's just been me lately. I miss her more and more every day. I still keep a little picture of her in my car, and I know she's here in spirit. We used to love morning trips for coffee, but it's been hard lately. I still order a drink for her, extra sweet how she likes. I can't bear being without her. I can't even throw away the cups. What the hell is wrong with me. We lost her last month and it doesn't feel real. Sometimes when the loneliness is too much ill sit with her picture and drink my morning coffee, have a little banter about the weather and pretend she isn't gone, just like the old days. I can feel her with me and that's all i need to keep me sane. I wish i could see her again, but death is the only thing that could bring us close again. Our daughter tries to shake me out of this pit I've dug myself into. I wish she could shake harder. God, I miss you karen. I'll see you soon. I'll bring a mocha just how you like< /Review>

<text>Everyone is SO nice here! Sometimes buying at the window will be faster than the drive thru, so don't be tempted by "convenience"!

The drinks are great, but my only gripe is ONCE in a long while someone won't make it as good as usual. Consistency is so important to me, and is the only reason I won't rate 5 stars for this amazing place!<//text><Gmap_id>0x808506efc0c258dd:0xccd1f472f1b435fa</Gmap_id><Name>Jay N<//Name><user_id>100151538572454149186</user_id><date>1513492194415</date></record></dataset><record>

I waited,no kidding or exaggeration, at least 20 minutes  in the line to order a drink. After one car pulls in behind you, there is no turning back. Very, very nice people but the wait out weighs good people and drink. Sorry...< /text>

First time here, and I'm not impressed. The staff working are literally shouting at each other (over the very loud what I would consider to be not suitable music) to communicate. However, I did  order and receive my beverage quicker than the vehicles in the queue. One thing I also noticed is that the straws are not individually wrapped and they insert the straw for you which I'm not a fan of. Other than that it seems like a cute place.< /text>

<Text>The workers are sweet and you can tell they have fun and enjoy their job! One worker came and brought us out coffee while waiting instead of calling through the window. Great customer service! The coffee is great too! Don't get a large though! A large is bigger than a trenta or 30ounce cup from starbucks! Also if you like strong coffee ask for an add shot!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808506efc0c258dd:0xccd1f472f1b435fa<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

First time there, the one in Napa, I walked up since I didnt know what I wanted,  they were slammed so I waited & waited, not one person said I'll be right with you, but when a young lady did help me, she was very friendly, very helpful & I got my first drink for free. It was pretty good. I already forgot the name of it but it was like a Mocha freeze. Pretty good.<//text>

I had fun even while waiting in the drive thru line. They were blasting pop songs from early 2000s and it was a great time. The barista helped me craft the perfect coffee and I loved it.</text>

My experience was great at Dutch Bros. During the time, I went the drive thru was a little bit busy, but I was down to wait since I promised myself to try out other coffee places wherever I see one. I ordered the Dutch Freeze since I was dehydrated and craving something cold. Dutch Freeze was delicious with the chocolate and caramel syrup dripping down the side of the inside of the cup!< /review>< pics>

Great service! Employees always friendly, cheerful, and wanting to know how your day is going. With 4 or 5 cars in the drive-thru, park and use the walk up window. Coffee is served fast and tastes great!<//text>

<Text>I visited on New Years eve and it was already around 9:50. They close at 10. The staff was as friendly as if it was opening time. They engage us in conversation and genuinely have a conversation that was fun and had us both laughing. Also since we are hours from a Dutch Bros in general, we always want to buy extra rebels. All other locations in Cali we visit give us guff about on hand qty levels and refuse to sell us additional cans. They try to disuade us by saying its $5.25 a can but I still want them. (I'm a big fan of the company and how it does business and I think their rebels are a tastier better option than red bull or monsters. So I want them at home just for general pick me ups. My opinion is if I want to buy them and you have them in stock dont you want to sell them. Besides you also make a sale of them without having to spend the extra ingredients in prepping them with flavors and cups and still sell them as if you did.) Anyway this location was not like that they just asked how many and sold them to us. That was great in my eyes because as I said every other location pretty much denies us the sale. So if you want cans of rebels this is a spot to get them at. Overall great stop for quick drinks and great staff.< /Text>< Time>

Tasty stuff, I think their drinks taste better than Starbucks. TBH the wosrt part is the blasting  high tempo music first thing in the morning before any caffeine. If you can get past that, enjoy!< /Review>

Dutch Brothers, when will you bring your heavenly coffee and perky barista' s with their peppy music and witty banter to Modesto CA? Is it normal to drive an hour and a half to get coffee??? Well, until you move closer to me-I'll keep driving to Napa every chance I get!!! Who needs wine when you can have a Cocomo!!!!<//review>

<review>My card is being debited from Grants Pass, OR, not Napa, CA. This makes me uncomfortable with using my debit card here. Otherwise great coffee and service. They even have doggie treats for the 4 legged guests.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Dutch Bros - our favorite, down the street, go to, walking distance "coffee" shop.  My son and I walked down and I ordered a Horchata freeze.  My son ordered his usual Strawberry/Mango -- picture perfect.  It looks nasty (what is it - caramel and chocolate drizzle wth haha).  He gets it all the time, so it must be good.  He got "extra" strawberries .. haha okay theDom you go boy.  Waited for our order while playing cornhole.  I'm not very good at it, but an employee was done with the drive thru orders and asked my son if he wanted to play a round.  Of course my son won, hahaha.  Love this place and their staff.  Always super up beat -- the other morning, I was walking pass the shop and they was jamming on a Thursday morning!! What else is new though, super awesome staff!! <3 ☺</review>
