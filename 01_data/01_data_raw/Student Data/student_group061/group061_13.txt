<Review>Very professional and thoughtful of their customers! The sweet lady who did my septum was kind and kept me calm and informed through the quick process! Prices for piercings were fair and they were very informative for after care! Would highly recommend!!!< /Review>< GmapID>

<Review>Love the lady who did the nose piercing for me and my oldest daughter. She talked me thru it BUT it still hurt like a knife lol. She was very friendly, funny, professional, patient, and not to mention a cutie!!! The vibe is amazing. Very clean and organized. No cluttered counter or desk. No one hanging around. The girl at the desk didn't have a mask on but the others that I did see had it on. She was very friendly and helpful with the forms. Since I have never been in a tattoo parlor, this is and was the best. When I get the nerve to get my Tigger, I will be going back to them. A must go to in Victorville</Review><gmapID>0x80c365cd18cfd6a5:0x6e0f09208d3c30a1</gmapID>< username>

I got BOTH my dermal sternum piercing done here at Tattoo Image and I absolutely love them! The piercing process was done before I knew it, it was quick, but she made sure the piercing was centered and in the right spot. Becca was very professional and she made me feel comfortable!</text>

Rebecca is the greatest. She does my piercing and is very professional and informative. I wouldn't have anyone else do my piercings. Stephen also did my half sleeve and did an amazing job, I truly love their work at Tattoo Image ❤<//review>

<review>I just went to get my first tattoo and I am in love with the outcome. Not only did the artist, Jessie (@tattoosbypulga), make me feel so comfortable, but she kept me talking during the appointment which helped me stay distracted from the pain haha! She did an amazing job on the tattoo and all the details, I was blown away with how she was able to capture exactly what I wanted. The quality was exactly what I was looking for and let me just say you get what you pay for with this place! I will surely be back to her for another tattoo in the future. Definitely follow Jessie on instagram & check her & Tattoo Image out!!< /review>< Pictures>

With my nose, Becca talked to me the entire time and told me to breathe in my nose and out my mouth and I didn’t feel much anything besides a pinch. My tongue was same way except I couldn’t talk back because I had a clamp on my tongue. They are really clean there. Becca cleaned everything before piercing me and she had gloves on while cleaning it. She mad sure it was placed where I wanted. She told me how to clean both of my piercing before and after she had pierced me. I highly recommend getting a piercing with Becca. She is amazing.</review>< resp>

<Text>Samantha...micro-blading goddess! My first of ANY permanent make-up or tattoo. They look so good that my threading lady stopped to check them out and asked for her name to pass onto her clients. Samantha talked to me for awhile to see the movement/alignment of my natural brows, asked about the colors I dye my hair, make-up, recommended colors but listened to my feedback, great tips for after-care, and had solid ideas for the the follow-up. It was truly a collaborative effort! Her talent and shop is a jewel in the HD!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1595781719308, 'text': 'Thank you so much Shaunna!!!!!!'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Becca was super nice and so quick. I came all the way from Connecticut to get my nose pierced here. I love it. Costumer service was great. She was quick and easy. It didn’t hurt at all. And it 20 bucks.</Review>

<Text>Very clean! Even though it's a tough looking tattoo shop, I didn't get a dreary or bad vibe from the atmosphere. The piercer was very cool and very kind! She was very gentle with me and answered all my first timer questions without making me feel stupid! My piercing is healing well so far and the price was pretty great! If I were to get another piercing, I'd come here again!</Text>< user_id>

I walked in without an appointment and felt like everyone there went above and beyond to make sure I got what I wanted quickly. The only thing I would change is the fact that I had to sit in a chair and lean my head back out of the way while my chest was being tatted, left me a little light headed after my session. They probably do have beds, but idk.<//review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Went in shop, waited about ten minutes. There was people already waiting in front for service when we got there, No one ever came to the front so we just left. But they sounded like they was having a good time in the back so I give one star for good atmosphere. Me and my best friend was trying to get tattoos.< /Review>

I came in to get a bar through my daughters ear. it was affordable and good quality.  the lady that pierced my daughters ear did a good job with explaining to us the procedure (like what to expect, how it's going to feel, proper care...ect. ) I would definitely recommend this place for piercing.  I never got any tattoos by them so I can't say anything about that side. sorry.< /text>

Becca was awesome. I walked in and walked out I 15 minutes. I had four people ahead of me. 3 piercings later I was happy with my choice. All the reviews about Becca were good and the price was less than I'm use to. Nice clean and friendly shop.<//Review>

<review>I had appointment  For a piercing I was 7 minutes late she wouldn't take me she didn't tell me that earlier on the phone that if I was late they wouldn't take me I drove out of my for them to tell me she was gonna take me not very professional you should tell people when you're on the phone with them if you're late more than 5 minutes you would have to reschedule I'm not going back and I will not  Recommend anybody I know to go there because of that reason I don't care how good you are 1st impression sucked.</review>< pics>

{'time': 1604176528741, 'text': '"Hi! We are so sorry that there was some confusion with your appointment. We did go over our policies on the phone when you made your appointment. If you are late we cannot guarantee being able to take you. We have covid requirements to adhere to and other clients with appointments so we have to remain on schedule. Our appointments are currently very close together and we have to follow strict guidelines, so being almost 10 minutes late does not allow us to do paperwork, the piercing, and go over aftercare. One person being late can cause a severe domino effect and cause us to be late on every other appointment after which is not fair to our other clients. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope you understand!'}<//response>

Got a eyebrow peircing a while back that went amazing and healed well. I also Went in for a quote on my tattoo  yesterdya and was able to get fit in the same day. Aaron did an amazing job on my wrist tattoos and replicating my parents handwritings. Super professional clean and just amazing work. I am definitely going to go back for the rest of my sleeve tattoos I highly recommend them for any tattoos and piercings 😄<//Review>

Went in to get a daith piercing and was not disappointed! Becca is the piercer at Tattoo Image and she did a fantastic job. She was knowledgeable, friendly, and her station was clean and welcoming. She walked me through the steps and was good at making sure I was comfortable. I would recommend going to see her!</review>

Very professional. Clean and sterile supplies. If you need any piercings done? Becca is the girl to go to at Tattoo Image. I took my 12 and 17 year old kids to her and she was Awsome.....will definitely go back!💙❤💙< /Review>

<review>I got my tattoo with Steven, and he did a wonderful job. They were laid back but still PROFESSIONAL and fun at the same time. Parlor was clean and pleasant, and I didn't feel out of place, I felt welcomed as customer. I didn't have to wait weeks for an appointment. I called, met with him within 48 hours. He drew up a design over the next few days and I had my tattoo within a week (I think) of contact. I will not go anywhere else for tattoos in the future.< /review></record>

<Review>I went to Tattoo Image with a complicated design and a great deal of uncertainty.  Three sessions later with Ernie and I will not go to another shop.  Phenomenal work.  I really can't convey how impressed I am with this guy.  If you want a tattoo in the Inland Empire, then you had better come here.< /Review>< Pics>

Came here originally just to have a piercing done. But was really interested in the art they have, and talked to one of the artists about possibly having a cover up done.

He was really knowledgeable about everything, and explained the ways I could have it covered up.

The appointment and having a sketch done will be a deposit of $40, which goes towards the actual tattoo, and pricing will be anywhere from $100 - $120 per hour.

The inside of the parlor is really clean and well lit, and the artists seemed very skilled.

My piercing was done by Becca, and she did a wonderful job on it. My only problem was that they are a cash only establishment, which meant I had to leave and come back to pay.< /text>

Got my bottom lip pierced last year and everything went well. I didn't really feel pain from getting the piercing but being sore afterwards. They gave me specific instructions on how to keep it clean and I never had a problem with doing so.< /Review>

<review>I got my industrial done here. Everything seemed good with it but a few days later I noticed the bar was started cutting though my skin and was starting to get infected. I went back to bring up my concerns and she just told me to keep icing it and take ibuprofen every 6 hours for a few weeks and to leave it in because it would eventually go away. She never even looked at it. I went and got a second opinion and that piercer told me she didn’t pierce it right. The holes weren’t angled correctly to make a straight line and the bar was forcing it to be straight. She pierced it too close to my head that I wouldn’t be able to wear sunglasses. She also gave me medical advise when it is illegal for her to do that. He also said if I were too keep it in like she said I would always had issues with it because it wouldn’t heal.<//review><rating>1<//rating>< GmapID>

The customer service is nice. I don’t ever write a bad review.. might be my first. But I got my belly button pierced and it got infected nasty. I’ve had it before so I know how to clean it... but this time it was just awful I had to take it off. I have one of my ears with a Tragus piercing, again I know how to take care of it.. I came here to get my right one (Tragus) pierced and it has been infected  again.. it sucks cause know I had nasty scars on my belly button and on my ear since I had to take them off cause it was getting worse and worse. Won’t be coming back for any more piercings.</Text>

<Text>tattoo image is good quality, however i do kinda feel ed has so much work that he doesnt take more work seriously.  i had a tat done on 9-11-01 by ed and it still looks awesome, so i returned when it was time to do my sleeve and stacy took my number down for ed and of course i never heard back and if you call hes ""busy" so i took my work elsewhere<//Text>< user_id>

I've been coming here since a kid. The staff is generally friendly and they have a good variety of snacks and such. I did have an experience today that rubbed me the wrong way. I bought a Bubble water and two Power Bar Protein Plus bars (cookies n cream flavour). The bars are on sale for 50 cents but I got charges regular price for them. My total came out to be about $7 When I mentioned it, I was only refunded 50 cents. I didnt have time to argue because I was going to be late for my class but I am very upset by it. Never going to trust the sale markings again.<//Text>

<Text>Fabulous service, with many Wall mount flatscreens. We had the spicy olives (not over hot), vegetable soup and the salami pizza. All was served quickly and tasted fresh!   I had a few draft beers to choose from and she had a Chardonnay. Exactly lunch!< /Text>< pics>

<review>The food was delicious, don't get me wrong, the issue I had was the menu. I understand that Napa is a hip and happening place but that doesn't mean the menu has to look like it was designed by a hipster with an art degree from the University of Phoenix. Throw in a a few bullet dots at the front of the actual name and it'll be good to go. Once you get past the horrible menu, the staff is fantastic, and the food is delicious. Would recommend.< /review><date>1564877229405< /date><Rate>4<//Rate><Gmap_id>0x808450bd5d60a509:0x7e69c8907bb050b7</Gmap_id>< name>

We are here after touring the Culinary Institute of America and the staff was really kind to have one of the employees, who was studying there, come talk with us about school life.

Walked in for dinner and the host was very uninviting. We sat down with menus and continued to sit for 10-15 minutes without anybody saying a word to us. The waitress walked by 5 or 6 times and couldn’t even say I will be right with you or take our drink order. Keep in mind they were far from busy. There were only 3 other groups in the place. Then the host walked by and coughed all over the place without even covering his mouth or face in any way. We got up and left and won’t be headed back anytime soon.<//text>

Stopped in on Sunday on our way home from Indian Springs. I was excited because the reviews looked great and when we parked, it didn't appear to be too busy.

We waited at the hostess stand for at least three minutes before we were acknowledged. 75% of the tables were empty when we walked in but it didn't seem like anyone was working in the place besides one frazzled server. After he sat us, it took another five minutes to get water, another five after that to put in an order. Also, it was very unclear who was serving us.

We ordered the pesce fritto as an appetizer, which came out right away. my friend ordered a soup as an appetizer as well, but we had to ask for it. Our entrees were served about 20 minutes later.  I ordered a burger medium rare and it came out medium well. at that point, i just wanted to eat and go to bed, so i didn't feel like sending it back. who knows how much longer we would have sat there?

Anyway, the french fries are delicious and if you like to drink, it seems like a chill spot. Other than that, definitely two stars.<//review>

Our go-to for dinner when there's a big game on. We are not really avid spots fans but we do enjoy the atmosphere and energy of a big game. Cook Tavern perfectly walks the line between sports bar and quality casual restaurant - the food, wine and beer have always be excellent when we've visited. Many of the staff seem a bit unenthusiastic and I dislike that there is only one single toilet/stall to be shared by all customers and staff.< /Review>

Food was great but the service was sub par. Our server may have had a rough night going into our visit for lunch. Slurring his speech, not dressed properly, and staring awkwardly at his notepad the whole time. It was very uncomfortable< /text>

meh. Service was painfully slow, even though it wasn't packed. One meal came out near 15 mins after the rest of the group was served. Food was just OK. Wouldn't go back.</Review>

<Text>I walked in here on 4/24/21 and had a very interesting experience with the front staff member. She stated that my insurance was not accepted by them so I asked how much the office visit would be to pay out of pocket. Her response was, “You can’t be seen here since you have an insurance we don’t accept and that would be fraud.”
I didn’t understand this??! What is fraud? That I want to pay to be seen for a visit that my insurance does not cover? I was going to ask for an explanation behind this, but decided to just walk away. It would have made better sense if it was simply office policy, but FRAUD!? I work at an urgent care myself and we would have no problem if someone wanted to pay out of pocket to be seen. The last thing any urgent care should do is declining service if they have nothing to lose!!<//Text>< pictures>

So I have insurance.  Blue Shield PPO but did not have my card.  I have a picture of it on my phone but they will not take it like that.  They said they could not photocopy it but they could my ID. I said so I can’t be seen and they said no unless I can fax my card over. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I said I have a photo of the card on my phone. They said they could not scan it.  However if I don’t have insurance, I could be seen. Good job.</Text>

<Review>Fast, easy and at a low price.  I take care of myself. So, I don't need medical. But, I did need a prescription. They helped me out. I gave them 4 stars. only because the video chat wasn't.<//Review>< pics>

I've been here a few times now and while nobody looks forward to going to urgent care I couldn't be happier with the treatment & level of service provided. The staff is very friendly and the head physician is great, very knowledgable & personable. I highly recommend this urgent care to anyone in need!<//review>< pics>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Rude and unprofessional. The receptionists were completely passive aggressive, impatient and rude to myself and my employee that I sent there when he got injured at work. When I called asking what EXACTLY I needed to do to get him seen by a doctor, I was treated with quite possibly the worst customer service I've ever heard. I have filed workers comp claims before and never have I had a medical office not see someone- especially when the employee came in with the information necessary to prove he had coverage by our insurance company. My injured (only 18 years old) employee finally let me know he had left because of how rude the front desk was to him and said he was not comfortable being seen by them. I felt horrible I sent him there and would never send anyone else. I am notifying my workers compensation insurance company to let them know they should remove them from their list of providers. Don't waste your time- go somewhere else where the staff actually cares.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80deaafb9815b9ef:0xad2d82f84b665c03<//GmapID></record>

<text>Visiting from Missouri I came here with my grandson with a high fever and feeling really bad. By the time we arrived his fever dropped but still feeling bad. The doctor looked at him and said he is just tired from a busy day traveling. Fever continued climbing to 103.2 the next day. Came back on Monday and took him to the doctors. Did a nose swab and came back flu. He said it would of been nice to start Tamiflu when the symptoms started. So do not go to this urgent care.<//text>< pictures>

Came here years ago and had no issues.
My last three visits have been horrific.
First visit, ask for specific lab work, I find out in my next visit 6 months later they didn’t do the test I specifically requested.
Second visit, I learn my test 6 months ago was garbage, other than that it was okay.
Last visit, I had to do follow up lab work related to my second visit. Was told to call a few days later, 4 weeks later I still don’t have results. Here are some great lines that were given to me:
“It usually takes this long”
“Can you call the lab” <— seriously.
“They have to test it multiple times”
“I will call the lab” <— turns out they didn’t
I’ve since spoken to other medical professionals and they've said the average turn around is 3-5 days.
Please please go somewhere else.< /text>

One of the best urgent cares I’ve ever been to by far. I’ve had a serious parasitical infection where even my home clinic would suggest I’m crazy do to taking anti depressants. They were the ones who always heard me out till the end to come to a conclusion to my situation. And when I thought all hope was lost in convincing a doctor, they gave me the right treatment that got rid of them all. I am coming back after all those doctors who said it was a mental health condition, because when I was starting to believe it was, they proved me wrong. And I’m eternally grateful 🙏🏻< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>I would give this place negative stars if I could!! I came in with my son because of a fever. The front desk representative told me that we needed to go to the ER instead and they wouldn’t see us. She asked zero questions and simply said there’s nothing they can do for a fever. & That he would need blood work and they don’t provide that service. She never even checked us in to speak with a physician. When she turned us away, I immediately went to the ER for his fever. By the time we got there and were checked in, he had a seizure in the ER waiting room. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. I’m thankful we weren’t stuck in traffic and had made it to the ER. The ER couldn’t believe that this place had turned us away.  Go somewhere else. Anywhere else. I was appalled at the lack of patient care provided by the office staff.< /text><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80deaafb9815b9ef:0xad2d82f84b665c03<//gmap_id>< Rating>

Mixed review do to inane policies. It is the closest place to my home and since it is the weekend I can't go to my regular doctor. I gashed my big toe last night in a freak accidentqi. It is Sunday. I was here less than a month ago, because I crashed on my mountain bike and it was a Saturday and gave them all of my insurance etc. They told me that since it's more than two weeks,  they need to see the card again which I don't have a hard copy of. Thankfully my wife is home and we'll bring the card to me.

While they open at 8 am, the doctor doesn't get here until 9. If I thought I could drive to another location and be seen sooner I would.

In fairness, despite the ridiculous procedures they have in getting seen, the nurses and the doctor have a great bedside manner.

They don't do any sort of priority of injuries or it is first come first serve. I thought it was a little ridiculous as I came in with a bleeding toe and was in a lot of pain. I didn't get to see the doctoruntil 9:30 a.m. when I showed up when the place opened at 8 a.m. and I was the third person through the door.

So all-in-all I like the doctor and the nurse and the X-ray tech and believe that I proper medical treatment. It's still was better than going to the emergency room. All they need to do is to change their procedures a little bit and they could easily get four or five stars.<//Text>

<text>I have had to go to this Urgent Care twice in the last month, and can say that I am more than happy with them. They are more than professional and always answer any questions I may have. I never feel like I am just a number, but always feel I have the doctor and nurses full attention when they are in the room. I never like to go to the doctors, but when I need one, I will feel comfortable going back without hesitation.</text>< pics>

I tried this place twice.  The first time, I walked in , the doc was seeing one person and I was next.  Waited 45 minutes and asked how long it would take since the previous patient left 20 minutes earlier.  Girl said oh, he stepped out for 15-30 minutes.  I left.  Second time, no one was there but me.  One girl came in 5-10 minutes after me.  I waited 40 minutes in the waiting room, then over 30 minutes in the examination room.
I saw him walk in, and he went right to the person who arrived AFTER me.  Each time was a different doctor, so it just seems to be their practice to waste your time.  Won’t go back.  Minute Clinic would dojust as well, without the wait!</review>

<Review>They went out of their way to stretch out my medication so I ingest as many chemicals as possible rather than one simple dose only because I named a medication that had worked in the past, they used that against me saying I was requesting the medication when I was simply giving them the facts .the doctor Jeffrey Kile examined me by asking 2 questions and using the light on his phone to check my throught . I know I’m not a professional but I’m certain they teach more than that in medical school. If I don’t get a refund then I think my only choice would be to take legal action and file a law suit.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Debatable.  Went in for an ingrown nail. Dr gave me antibiotics and told me to soak my foot in epsom salt for 2 weeks. It somewhat helped, I ended up taking matters into my own hands after.

Before that, I went in , and had a long wait because of my insurance card issue. Can’t have a picture. Have to to have a paper copy or have it faxed. Which was time consuming, apparently they can’t look up any info there.

A different time,  I called to see if they offer blood drawn pregnancy tests. I was told they DO. Drive the 35 min down there, to tell me that, “that’s outdated and isn’t offered here. Idk who told you that”

Teach your employees some customer service skills. Make sure everyone gets the memo about these things. Not everyone has time to drive out of their way, to find out it was a waste and no one has correct information.

There are other urgent cares. Steer clear of this one.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I took the half of the tip of my finger off in a kitchen accident. The nurses and the doctors were all highly professional and kind. I was seen within twenty minutes of arriving and filling out the forms.  They were friendly and communicative when I was being treated. They patched me up, gave me stitches and treated me quickly and painlessly. The only improvement I could suggest would be making the place more well signed because it did take us a couple of extra minutes to find the building in the dark. It would be great if they had a bigger sign.

All round a very kind, very helpful service and I'm very glad I went here and not the ER.
Thank you.<//review>

For clarification, the staff was friendly and the nurse was competent and nice.  I had to wait a long to to see the doctor after being checked out by the nurse.  The female doctor I saw was unprofessional, rude, strange acting and did nothing to examine me.  She stood away from me and did not seem to want to get near me.  I went in for eye problems and told her I thought it may be pink eye but I did not know. She said okay, wrote me a prescription and left.  As I said before, she did not examine my eyes to figure out what was wrong.  I could have been given a prescription that would have hurt instead of helped whatever was wrong with my eyes.  I then heard her go to the next  patient and rudely say "I need to know why you are here!".   I complained to the person out front, wrote a comment card and have since sent an email to the Center.  I will not go back to this Urgent Care nor will my family.< /Text>< pictures>

They are not open until 10, won't see patients after 9. The front office lady wouldn't explain and also didn't offer advice on where else to go. (We are from out of town.) She just told us ALL urgent cares close at 10. I was super mad when they wouldn't look at my mom's obviously infected finger from a bad cut. We ended up in the ER. Thank goodness!! After reading the reviews, which I should have done before going, I am very glad they didn't take us. I would have never let them treat my mom without me being there, and probably would have flipped out on them, had they been any kind of rude to her. She needed her stitches removed, the nerve blocked, and her wound cleaned out thoroughly. She also needed two specific antibiotics. From the reviews, I doubt she would have received that care here.  We are from out of town, but visit San Diego often, and will NEVER use this urgent care!< /review>

Worst place ever, I went with my baby that throwing up, they didn't dodany exam and told he has viruses. They gave me a prescription with just the amount of medicine for 4 doses,but to be to be taken every 4 hours as needed. The baby was getting better but I needed to go back on the other day to get a refill because the amount they prescribed wasn't enough even for a full day. I was told I would have to pay again 170 dollars for the doctor to see the baby and give another prescription. They clearly tried to screw us up as in the first time they should have gave us at least enough amount for 3 days. Definitely not recommended. Other than that when I took the child they didn't do any exam and straightly told it was viruses. Not recommended at all.</text>

< Review>
This was honestly the worst doctor’s experience of my life. Went in with a sore throat and a bunch of other symptoms while on vacation. Doctor looked at my throat for two seconds, said it was strep without doing a strep test and ignored my other symptoms.  Then they wrote me a prescription for antibiotics.

After four days with zero change, I called and they told me to come back in. Again doctor (though a different doctor) looked at my throat and said, okay just going to change your antibiotics. Again they didn’t want to do any tests to figure out what was actually going on. Again they ignored my other symptoms.

On top of the shoddy medical practices they were completely unprofessional. First doctor made me extremely uncomfortable after making a joke about my last name. Then the second doctor spent almost 15 minutes trying to tell me what I should do with the rest of my life. It made me super anxious, which is not what you want when you’re sick.</Review>

My son was doubled over with stomach pains and I saw they were open until 10. I sent him there in an Uber 9:30 as he could not drive. The front receptionist told him they could not see him because they were closed (front doors were open). He was too weak to argue so left and stood outside. I called them to ask them to take him as he is away at college and didn’t have anyone to turn to. She told me to tell him to go to the ER. I told her was was outside doubled over in pain and she said “well, we are closed and want to be out of here by 10.”  What a horrible human and a horrible organization that turns away patients because they want to go home early.</Review>

<Review>I don't understand all the negative reviews. Some people just complain about anything I guess. This was one of the best clinic visits I've ever had. Very short wait, nice staff and doctor. Got me taken care of very quickly. I was in and out in under 45 minutes. They don't have a lab in the clinic, otherwise I would give them an Excellent. Very comfy waiting room.</Review>< Time>

Don't accept Medical patients. Boo, these clowns refuse Medical and rude front office staff. Sad because when I did have insurance that they actually accept which is rare the on staff doctors are great. I went here a few times when my insurance was accepted in the past for few issues and doctors were quite good. It is the billing and front desk staff that needs a reboot! Now they don't take any third party insurance let alone Medical.<//text>

So I told her the DA said to get checked out and told her I have med ins her next response was...... We don't do X-rays . So I said your web site says you do and then her response was...... He needs a " special " X-ray that shows fluorescent. All we could do was stand there stunned. Not offering any insight on where to go, Finally we asked where that would be done. She said the ER. As we began to leave I told her I should have listened to the Google reviews and not have wasted my time going there

Went  to Urgent Care so we didn't have to spend the day at ER for a simple X-ray.  Not a single patient in the place . Only car was ours What does that tell you

I wonder if this URGENT CARE FACILITY.  Is really a front for something else , because it is definitely NOT a health facility. What really goes on behind those closed doors ??????< /text>< Pictures>

While traveling, I visited this location with a minor who had all medical information, including insurance, and they would not accept it. They had all information, including an image of the insurance card, which they refused to accept. They demanded a faxed copy of the insurance card (who has a fax machine in their home nowadays??) HOWEVER, their fax machine didn’t even work!!!!! They referred to me, the adult in the situation, as an a**hole... so professional. The “medical assistant” refused to let me speak to a supervisor, let alone anyone else in the office. I would rather sit in another office waiting to be seen for hours than ever go back to this location. Extremely disappointed and would never recommend visiting this location.< /Text>

I visited this clinic twice. First time was for an allergy, and they took some blood samples for lab. Never got the lab report back. Waste of money (high deductible so paid out of pocket). Second visit I did not have my insurance card, and they said they would not treat me without, even though I had been there before. They don't keep records, and they don't follow up. Most urgent care facilities will treat you regardless of insurance. In my case I have Aetna, and I'm willing to bet the receptionist could have obtained it for me...but didn't care to be helpful. Walked out never to return.</text>

I was really thankful for this place. After suffering with a terrible cough for days I found my red eyes were stinging and realized I probably had pink eye. I was able to get in prior to the evening cut off and the doctor saw me right away.

Got diagnosed and medications prescribed in record time. On the road to recovery. What a relief. I thought the doctor and nurse on staff were excellent.<//Review>

I received great service each time I visited.  I visited for the first time when I became sick in January.  I was provided with a breathing treatment (in-office) and the appropriate prescription medications to help me fight off the flu-like symptoms.  My daughter was seen last week after a basketball injury.  The performed x-rays and scheduled a follow-up.  The wait, on all three visits, was minimal.</review>

<Text>We called at 7:45PM and asked when they closed. They said 8:30PM. We arrived at 8:15 and were told the doctor did not want to see us and to go to another clinic. The medical staff was then rude to us. Told us they couldn't tell us the doctors name and made up some bs policy they had. I asked to see the policy and they said it was locked in a room they didn't have access to. We paid a uber to drive us here and now were out 22$ just to get back home. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a clinic and would not recommend anyone go here if they have any serious issue at all.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I show up at 9:40pm (open until 10:00pm) with a bladder infection needing some meds.  I am in pain.  What does the doctor decide to do?  LEAVE EARLY!!!!  The doctor was gone and the place was closed.  How is that for service.  If you have a business that says you are open until 10:00pm, be open until 10:00pm.  If you want to close at 9:30pm, then change your hours.  Lousy customer service.</text>

I have no idea what the bad reviews are about.  Everyone at this urgent care was friendly and I thought the level of care was excellent.  My son needed stitches on vacation in the evening.  The staff, nurses, and Dr. Cannis were all great.  The Dr. explained everything clearly and talked with my son throughout the procedure.  They took my insurance info and are trying to bill them before charging me.  I was pleased with everything.< /review>

Worst urgent care I have ever been to. Doctor did not explain what was wrong with me and only looked at me for 30 seconds before ushering me back out to the lobby to wait for my script. After 3 days no improvement. I called back and was told it would be another 150 dollars just to be seen again even though all other urgent cares I've been to it's free if there was no improvement. Front staff was polite that was the only nice thing about this place. Would not recommend to anyone who is legitimately sick.< /text>

My 1 year old son and I were sick and were unable to be seen by our primary care provider. We needed an alternative. As with any urgent care there is a wait, as with any doctor really. Much less crowded than an emergency room. Dr Cannis was very caring and attentive of our needs. They saw us both at once and medicated us both on the spot. He checked and rechecked my son's lungs to be sure he was breathing without struggle or congestion. The nurses were very nice as well, despite the fact that they had a disruptive set of people come in and cause mayhem. Comfortable and a nice alternative to the ER<//Text>

<Review>If I could give negative stars I would. Please, please stay far away if you are actually sick or hurt.

An inability to diagnose based solely on malpractice and incompetence from multiple doctors.

BUT, if you're looking for free drugs and sketchy practice this is your go-to clinic.

Holly, the "office manager", was HORRIBLE. She is mean, under-qualified, and unprofessional.

Nothing is externally wrong with you so you don't get priority. At Urgent Care & More, I never waited more than 30minutes to see a doctor. He even gave me something immediately to decrease the swelling so I could breathe. I have never tested positive for a rapid strep test and by the time you get the results from the longer one back, it's already been a few days of torture and sleepless nights. It was nice having my immediate need taken care of and not having to wait for days.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< Name>

The doctor on duty, Dr. Vasiliki Anvari has absolutely no regard for patient care and I had to ask the front desk staff to tell me what my diagnosis was because the doctor didn't feel the need to. Funny because I thought that was in her job description. She also prescribed me medicine I can't take with my condition and when I requested an IV for fluids due to serve dehydration, she said they don't provide that. Don't go here. It's a waist of your time and money. Just visit the emergency room if you need quality care!<//text><Rating>1</Rating><Gmap_id>0x80deaafb9815b9ef:0xad2d82f84b665c03<//Gmap_id></record>

The doctor that was in prescribed me the wrong antibiotics (according to outdated guidelines probably). He also gave me unsound advice about how to deal with an infection. After getting two second opinions, they were horrified that I was told what I was told and prescribed what I was prescribed.
I am definitely not going back here. Protocols are out of date, which is scary to me, considering I was prescribed an antibiotic that wouldn't even have gotten rid of the infection.</review>

I took my wife there after she experienced a pretty severe allergic reaction to a prescribed antibiotic.
When we arrived I could smell a musty , moldy smell coming from the building. When we walked through the door the smell almost knocked us over. When we entered the waiting room we noticed that the overhead light fixtures were pretty much filthy. I was not allowed to accompany my wife for the consultation and examination because of "legal requirements". This has never happened to me before at any medical facility.
My wife said that when she walked down the hall to the examination room she passed two large fans blowing full blast. It was a hot day and apparently they have no air conditioning. She said both fans were filthy.

To be blunt, I felt guilty taking my wife there. Commonly practiced procedures for cleanliness are not in place there. The staff seemed to be just putting in their time. One was busy with her phone, either texting, FB, or gaming.

I will say that they got my wife in very quickly. In retrospect it was probably because most people know better than to go there, so the place was empty. When we left I had a horrible headache, probably from beathing whatever crap is growing in that building.

If you aren't sick when you get, there you will be by the time you leave.< /review>

Worst medical expierence of my life. Yes, it's a short wait but not worth it. Dr. John Pedrotty is awful. I went in for neck and back spasms, he spent no more than a minute with me, then quickly listed about 5 medications as my treatment plan and left the room. His assistant returned with 2 syringes and when I asked what it was she listed two drugs I hadn't heard of. I asked to have hem explained to me or more information and she brought me print outs on them. When Dr. Pedrotty came back in the room he said 'what's this I hear about you not wanting treatment? At Urgent care we try and help you, why are you being difficult?' I tried to explain that I just wanted to understand what the medications were and what their side effects were. He kept cutting me off and scolding me like a child for wanting to understand my care. He finally replied ' if you don't want them you can leave'. I ended up getting the shots but now regret it. I should have just left when I got a bad feeling about the dr. Seriously this man is awful. Do not go here!< /Review>

<Review>I am glad I didn't listen to the reviews. Front desk staff were just doing their job. Telling you their policies blah blah blah. They had the facial expressions of take it or leave it but were willing to direct you in the right direction . Might not have the smiling tone but she was polite. Discharge nurse was nice smiling face and all. They were fast and to the point dr. Peres. Was so nice to my husband and told him EXACTLY what was wrong with him. He even took time get to know my husband and give him advice on his future endeavors. I can appreciate that. note that my husband saw his military doctor, and what ever meds they prescribed did not work atttt all. So I am grateful we went to urgent care. I surely did not want to go to the military hospital e.r and wait 8-10hrs for Motrin lol. Oh and when we were done the dr gave my husband a prescription note wishing him happy bday and wishing him to get well. How many doctors do you know will take time to do that.< /Review>< response>

Do not go to this place. The doctor and staff are unprofessional. The nurses were talking and laughing behind my back, and I saw one of the nurses go out for a cigarette break. The doctor I saw talked to me about his sex life and going to Tijuana to have sex with someone half his age. Very disturbing and unnecessary. Not worth the time or the money.< /Review>

<Text>Having been to this very Urgent Care Several times, if your not a stripper from next door at Pacers you will probably get horrible service if you can get service at all.
I went to this Urgent Care directly after dislocating my shoulder and was in severe pain. As I stated I have been to this urgent care several times & have used my Blue Cross Anthem PPO. The front counter nurse would not even talk with me if I could not provide my health insurance card. I did have my card on me but I was in such pain I could not locate the card in my wallet. I called a co worker and they were able to give me the plan number off his card. She would do nothing to even attempt to look up my information. I had no alternative but to got to another Urgent Care who just took Drivers License, promptly saw me and came back and told me what insurance I had. Long story short, I damaged my dislocation further by not being able to promptly put the joint back in. Never go to this Urgent Care your well being may depend on it.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This place is a rip off. The doctor litterly saw me for less than 90 seconds and while he was in the room didn't even talk to me. Dr. Tim Cannis staff was also very unprofessional when I called to get a doctors note so I could go back to work. They asked me what i wanted it to say! Now when i called to get them to change it so I could work more they want more money out of me? When i was there there was another customer that had the same complaint I did, the doc saw him for about a min and was gone. This play is ridiculous and I cant believe they were recommended by my health care.< /Review>

Poor service, very rude doctor, waited an hour and a half for 2 minutes of his time and he wouldn't even listen to what I said.  Extremely unprofessional.  Also, no privacy whatsoever.  I could hear every word of the conversation between the doctor and the patient in the rooms around me, so I know they could hear me too.  I would give it zero stars if I could.< /Text>

<Review>I went a couple weeks ago with a very stubborn sinus infection or something of the sort... had a zepac months ago but never got rid of it. So I went in, got checked out... unfortunately the antibiotics didn't work again. So I called them up and after a little haggling got them to agree to see me again without paying (I don't have insurance). Long story short once I saw the doctor he was so genuinely concerned with getting me better I really felt like I was back in Connecticut in my family doctor's office. Got a couple shots and some new meds with another free checkup in a couple days to make sure I'm coming along. First visit was a holiday Monday and I waited about 50 minutes (MinuteClinic wait was 4 hours, or it said 4 hours but I never ended up getting the txt), second minute was a non-holiday Monday and wait was under 30 minutes. I haven't read the bad reviews but I am happy even though I'm still sick... but hopefully these new drugs will get me through it.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Went to this facility for a simple PPD test, of which I called ahead to ensure that they perform them, and they said they do. We waited for 15 minutes, at which time they called me to the front desk and then said, "we dont do this PPD test here, it needs a doctor's signature." Being in medicine in myself (I am a doctor of physical therapy), I was certain that it is not the case and that PPDs can be read by physicians, nurse practitioners, PAs, etc. I then asked, well can a NP or PA in the back read the test? And she further said, "NO, ONLY AN MD CAN." At that point, I asked, what practitioner do you have in the back? She stated, "An MD, but he doesn't want to do it." Excuse me? He doesn't WANT to do it? As a therapist, I have NEVER turned down a patient. I could not imagine having a patient wait in my waiting room and then come out and say, "Oh, you have back pain? I don't feel like treating that today, go home." This was ABSURDLY UNPROFESSIONAL and shocked that they turned me away. I went to US healthworks in Hillcrest, and they were professional and easy going, and took care of me right away.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>The only thing I liked about it was that there was no one in the waiting room. Either this was a great thing!?! Or there is a reason no one comes here!!! The receptionists treated me like crap! She didn't even ask what was wrong or if I could as ok. And, by the way there were 2, count it-2, receptionists just for me- yay-  I was throwing up in a mask and peeing on the chair and I had a dislocated knee (so I couldn't walk on my own) yet when I asked for help all they did was point their fingers towards the bathroom around the corner- and this was ONLY because I didn't want to put MY throw up mask in the GENERAL OFFICE area!!!!- they were fine with me spreading my germs everywhere - I was doing what was right for other patients. Would you like to walk in - already sick- and be exposed to yet another virus or bacteria just because the receptionists were too lazy to take the appropriate care with previous patients?!?
The woman dr I saw was so incredibly stupid! I  have had an education and a MUCH better bedside manner than this woman. Anyone would!!!!! Would you expect a dr to just hand you a prescription for coughing with out asking a single question other than noticing you had a cough?  I also went in for a dislocated knee. Mrs dr lady was walking out of the room while I was calling her back to look at my knee. She noticed I couldn't get down from the table but continued walking on. She wouldn't even talk to me about it and I was the ONLY patient in the whole place!!! She just wanted to get rid of me, sit down, and have some coffee.
I have seen the male dr- I forget his name- and he took really good care of me. I had to see a specialist after- but at least he took the time and told me the truth.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<date>1417107587112<//date><rate>1<//rate><Review>The front desk staff was nice, but the doctor I saw, Dr. Cannis, was useless. Let me start by saying that I am a nurse. I have a pretty good idea about the medical world, and my experience with Urgent care and more was subpar. The physician I saw offered no bedside manner, no patient education, no reassurance, no help whatsoever. I went in for lower lumbar pain (muscular), and was instructed to continue taking tylenol and ibuprofen like I was already doing, and go to the ER if I wasn't feeling better in two days. That was it. He said he could prescribe me narcotics but since I am TTC, I decided not to. He didn't offer resources or suggestions to me. Didn't show me stretches to give me some relief. Didn't mention heat or cold therapy. No patient education whatsoever. Two days later I was not in the ER, I was at the chiropractor getting the help, support, and education that I needed. A week and a half later, I am feeling much better, no thanks to Dr. Cannis.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Went to this clinic while visiting my daughter here in San Diego. I had abdominal pain and was throwing up, I was very uncomfortable. Since there was a bit of a wait, I ask if there was anywhere I could lie down. The girl at the front desk told me if I felt that bad to go to ER, there is no place for you to lie down. My first impression of the clinic was this receptionist, who never smiled, offered any compassion but made sure I paid before they even got started. Within 45 min. I was brought in to see the doc. He spent about 5 min with me, asked me some questions about the pain, then proceeded to put in an IV since i appeared dehydrated. they kept giving me pills for pain and nausea, i kept throwing them up, they kept giving them to me orally, hello!!!!. And, i had to ask for something to throw up in! Needless to say, this Dr. had no idea what I had, didn't seem to really care. Very next day I had surgery to remove my appendix by the professionals at Scripps Mercy Hospital. Not to mention my aftercare in recovery was the best. So there you have it.<//Text>

If you want help do not come here. They only care about your money and not your well being. Office is rude and won't even answer any of your questions unless you give  all of your insurance information first and that's if they accept it. Otherwise if is urgent or you are dieing I would go anywhere else. Terrible service and homeless linger outfront</review>

Elliot and Rob are the truest form of gentlemen and scholars, Elliot saw me walking down the street instead of just standing there he Actually engaged me with a few chose words I was inside and buying something, Rob talked to me like only a concerned father would but instead of school  and work he just wanted to know I was getting enough weed and the right kind of weed. I will solely shop here b/c of the simple  top notch service thank you guys !< /Text>

Unfortunately there is no menu or pricing that is visible. I was disappointed when paying at the end. Not because of the excise taxes. The budtender quoted prices that were in the $30-40 price range. However charged $57 for my flower before taxes; that I chose specifically because of the prices stated. There was no place to argue so I paid. Being transparent with pricing is key. I will not return as it felt more like a shady drug deal. Good flowers though.</Text>

Was tiny, clean, not much to look at cus of covid and the set up was different from everyone else but was somehow the best I’ve been to lol. The two guys in there were kind and intelligent and the budtender was bud knowledgeable and sold me the best gg4 I’ve had in years. If you seek good medical bud without a card, come here. If you want cannabis education, this is the place</text>

<text>Joe Kerr and staff have been a fabulous resource and support to my family and I. The past 10 months have presented a lot of health challenges for us. Learning all about cannabis, how it works, what to expect, how to approach family dynamics, and how to manage a treatment plan... This is everything that the fog Center and their dedication to community healing has provided us. My aunt, who is only six months into her battle with stomach cancer, is has already exhibiting renewed strength, vigor, energy, and a renewed appetite for life. She is not yet in remission, but the progress has been nothing less than shocking and inspiring.

This review comes from a family which has had generational reservations about marijuana, legalities, and conflicting medical information in the mainstream... we're seeing first hand that places like The Phog Center are critical for maintaining the integrity of healing in the Cannabis community. They are not a profit-driven operation, which is exactly why we know they cared about our cases and took the time to make research-based, pragmatic recommendations. I never felt like a product was being sold to me. I only felt that the health of my loved ones was the absolute priority in every conversation. This is rare in today's world, and for this the Zevada family will always be appreciative. Thank you!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Nice and helpful people.  Great to have this in the neighborhood.  Looking at my receipt when I got home to see I gave my town: Pacifica $12.69...   just doing my part for the community!< /Text>

I am so happy that I found The Phog Center in Pacifica. They have helped me beyond what I thought I could be helped. I am a full time dog walker and was experiencing quite a bit of pain.
Elliot took his time and suggested what he thought would work for me. And it did.
The Phog Center is a safe, clean, friendly and very knowledgeable.
All I can say is Thank you!!!< /text>

<text>A good friend of mine highly recommended Emerald Phog.  I was unsure of the hours, and they had just closed when I arrived.  Joe was still outside, and was SO KIND to reopen for me.  I was completely shocked and amazed that he would do that for me, just to make sure I could get the medicine I needed for the weekend.  I have heard that they are compassionate here, but that goes above and beyond customer care!!! (Thank you, Joe!) The sign up process was quick and easy, and verification was done while I signed up.  It was a comfortable environment, and very professional at the same time.  Of course, Joe was friendly, helpful, and knowledgable.  The quality of the medicine was top shelf, and very generous for the price.  There were even freebies to make the trip even sweeter.  I will definitely return, and would tell you to go there today! You will not be disappointed.< /text><gmap_id>0x808f7aff6825d997:0x8510c81f59f76870< /gmap_id><Date>1504636868072<//Date><name>Carrie M</name><response>None< /response><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

I'm really impressed with this place. I am new to the medical needs and had everything explained beautifully. All questions I had were answered and I feel like they are here to help me! Awesome!
The other guys were cool, but for my medical needs, I find this the best experience yet.< /text>

Emerald Phog truly is the preeminent establishment for all your wants and needs.   Superior, knowledgeable folks that will meet and exceed all your expectations.
As a patient of emerald Phog I have received nothing but the best care possible from friendly knowledgeable people who have exceeded my highest needs and wants.

If your like me and don’t want the worry of smoking “pesticide” treated weed… Then get your butt down to emerald Phog, I promise you’ll be “HIGHLY” satisfied.<//Review>

It was a regular pharmacy dispensing medication - clean, organized and with a variety of products.  The people who worked there were very professional, polite and knowledgeable about the products. The experience was very positive and highly recommendable to others.</text>

Friendly employees and you can be surprised with amazing deals. The plant variety was more for landscaping but I am looking forward to seeing more indoor plants throughout the year< /Text>

I called in advance & the 2 star pines that I needed to complete a trio were waiting for my husband & me right in front. 3 bags of mulch, 2 ranunculas, & a flat of Irish moss & we were out the door within 15 mins. Thankyou, Victor, for such courteous & helpful info over the phone, & Antonio for letting us review the other 2 star pines on site, showing my husband & myself that you had made the right choices for us. Next you loaded the 7-ft. trees onto our truck, making pillows out of bagged mulch. We made it home via freeway from Chula Vista to Lemon Grove without damage. We're going back for tulip trees!</Text>

They employ folks who don't know about plants or don't care. Neither of those are helpful. Educate your staff so they can help customers make educated decisions. Or just put labels on your goods so we can use the internet to find answers.<//review>

<review>Found the exact variations of Jade plants I wanted which I can't seem to find in Florida.  I called ahead of time to see if they stocked them and they kindly looked up the data and confirmed before I went in.  I visited specifically for Jades and succulents but they have many more types of plants and trees available.  You want be disappointed with their succulent selection! They also have various types of media to buy such as various sizes of fir bark and different rock bases.  They have a nice pot selection as well.  Very friendly and helpful staff here.</review>< pics>

<review>After two months of trying the "premium compost" surprisingly it falls short of good nutrition in this soil. It lacks the essential compounds to keep vegetables growing. My wife and I had to add lot of amendments to try and save all our vegetables. This compost should be sold as mulch. That's about all it's good for.
Sorry Terra Bella....
BUT,
On a much happier note the selection of plants Terra Bella has and their customer service is very very good.</review><date>1596049101925</date></record>

I could not believe so many beautiful colors and shapes existed!  See my pics!  I also got a bunch of terracotta pots - what great prices they have on those!
The staff was so helpful, despite my 20 questions.  I plan to return for a fruit tree soon, and probably more veggies and succulents. I will never go to home Depot for plants again!!!</Review>< pictures>

Excellent Experience.

We were looking everywhere in San Diego for persimmon trees, especially at the Home Depots and Lowes, but could not find any. However, I ended up googling Garden Nursery and Terra Bella Nursery showed up.

I called them to ask if there were any persimmon trees and the lady very nicely told me she would call back once she checks. She gives me a call back saying that there was and we ended up heading there.

Please note that we did not know what a Garden Nursery was. When we got there my parents and I were so surprised on how beautiful the Nursery was. This place was 10x better than your Lowes and Home Depot. I'm surprised that places like these existed and thank God for google to let us know of a place like this.

Anyways, huge selections of beautiful fruit trees and plants, but the main reason I'm writing this review is that the workers there are super helpful people honestly. Lady on the phone was so nice enough to check even though when I got there it was super busy. Cashier was nice and funny. And there was a guy who helped us put 2 persimmon trees inside our Van.

We're definitely coming back.<//Review>

<Text>I was in a pinch to get some plants for a family member who lost her mother,  I googled and yelped and this nursery presented itself on both, scanned through the highly recommended posts and headed that way.  Staff didn't disappoint,  they even spent extra time to prepare my pot nicer when I told him it was for a death. Prices were great, selections were vast. I wish I lived in the area, would totally use them.  Definitely returning when visiting the area again.</Text>< Response>

< review>
I was rear ended on 5/20/19 on the freeway by a semi-truck from Terra Bella Nursery and I have been suffering physical pain for the past six weeks.  A claim has been filed with my insurance company Liberty Mutual, but it’s been weeks and Terra Bella’s insurance company, Patriot Risk, has been avoiding contact, they have not made any attempts to pay my medical bills, the bills associated with my car repairs, car rental during repairs, or to mitigate the damages. I’ve contacted the manager of Terra Bella Nursery and am still getting the run-around and they haven’t resolved anything. Their insurance company also will not return emails and phone calls from my insurance company, and I have had to pay out-of-pocket for numerous chiropractic and other medical appointments. Beware!<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Look at the tree in the photo I uploaded. Terra Bella Nursery told us they were selling us and delivering a 15 foot tall magnolia tree that had a very  large canopy in a 36" box. What they delivered was a 36" box, but the tree wasn't even 9' tall, and the canopy was barely over 3 feet wide. If you look closely at the trunk of the tree it was about 1 1/2" in diameter. This was totally absurd. The drive was told it was too small by the landscapers and  he still dropped off the tree. I arrived 2 minutes later when their truck was already pulled away. I immediately rejected the tree, but Terra Bella staff refused to come back to get their lousy small tree. This was fraud plain and simple. We had to argue with them to take the tree back, and we even had to load it on a truck and bring back on our own. The containers are about 500 to 600 lbs when full of first so this was no easy feat. The manager and the sales staff at Terra Bella Nursery were horrible. No one should ever have to argue with a company to immediately return something you never ordered in the first place. I will never do business with them. They are crooks, plain and simple.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Came in from out of town and needed some plants instead of flowers for a funeral. They where very nice spending time with me showing options for colorful plants.< /Review>

< Review>
They are AMAZING! I grew up in the Philippines so some flowers I only know the local name for them for example Dama de noche or Dancing lady flowers. When I was planting my garden I requested those flowers and they knew what they were right off the bat! They also have amazing options for gravel, wood chips. You name it they have IN STOCK. NO wait times for sod. They have helped me out so many times through the years it is ridiculous. Anytime I need some gardening for a home I have listed for sale I call them and right away I have what I need. Great service. Great selection. The BEST.</Review>

I would be lying if I said I was prepared to enjoy this meal as much as I did! We had a fantastic brunch at Spindleshanks - ordering a breakfast burrito and country fried steak and were blown away. To be completely honest, we were just looking for something to carry us over to dinner but Spindleshanks was so much better than we were expecting. The service was great as well; everyone was welcoming and following covid protocols. Will absolutely be back the next time we visit Tahoe!</Review>

<review>Food is decent but the service is terribly slow. If you get outside seating its fun with golf course view on one side and sort off lake view on the other side. Menu has decent variety and server was nice and friendly. But how can service during breakfast be this slow.<//review><date>1565460892680< /date>< Rating>

Great location.  Fish tacos we're very tasty but the tortillas were thin and made it difficult to pick up.  It soon became very messy.  Fresh mushrooms were a texture treat with the cabbage.  Friendly, young, cheery servers, students on exchange from Eastern Europe I think.  Beautiful outdoor setting.</Text>

It takes a lot for me to leave a negative review. My family and I wanted to spend a nice little mini vacation in Tahoe and decided on a nice carry out meal. Ordered the N.Y. steak, seafood linguini, pork belly and crab appetizer, and cheeseburger. We paid quite a lot for the food (including a good tip) and realized after getting back to the hotel that we were missing utensils, side sauces, and an entire entree. We get back in the car and drive all the way back to pick it up. Of course, by the time we get back the rest of the food is cold. My steak was overcooked. Appetizer was not separated like we asked and my son didn't enjoy his burger. No one should have to pay this amount for a meal when only a quarter of it could be eaten. Disappointed but at least we know not to come back.< /text>

Came in for brunch today and the hostess was super rude about my girlfriend having an ice coffee in her hand.
There were no signs about outside drinks, and instead of asking nicely for us to throw it away or take it out she rudely said “it’s not cool to bring in outside drinks to a restaurant” in a snobby tone and walked away before we even had a chance to respond.
The interaction was so upsetting to my girlfriend that we had to leave before ordering anything.

The food is usually really great and the service has never been bad with any other employee we have interacted with but this one rude interaction was enough to make us never want to eat there again.

That’s not how to talk to people.</Text>

We looked around Yelp for help to satisfy our hunger and fortunately this popped up on our search. The ratings don't it justice as it should absolutely be 5 stars! The music sets a relaxing ambiance and the food seals the deal. Strongly recommended!</text>

< Review>
Rude management!  Visited Sept 8, 2018.  Had not heard of the place but was staying down the road at Tahoe Vista.  Looked it up on Google, linked to the Spindleshanks website, and was pleased to find a coupon for $5 off two breakfast entrees.  The waiter was harried, but slowed down a bit  after I engaged conversation with him.  The  food was good... classic omelette and breakfast burrito.  When i presented the coupon the waiter didn't know about it, so he got his manager.  The "manager" (who said he was the owner but wouldn't give me his name) was rude and dismissive and refused to honor the coupon, saying it expired in February.  Then why is the coupon still on todays website?  I will not return to this place because of the owner/manager... he was unfriendly, unhospitable, and honestly... a creep.  To sum it up:  poor management.<//Review>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>Just back from dinner, reflecting on that, figured best to share our experience.  First, i should say I think the place has great potential.  Unfortunately, one of us noticed a critter (a cockroach) squirming in her half-eaten salad (the special salad).  Not the greatest experience; worse when the server seems unsurprised and indifferent.  My advice would be to inspect your dinner prior to digging in.  My Orange Roughy, the fish special, was good, though.  This was on June 28, 2019, at about 6:30 PM; the server was "Gordon G".<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Stopped by for breakfast with the family. Wasn't very crowded when we arrived at 8:30am but it started to get filled up about 30-45 minutes later.

Having read previous reviews about long wait times for food to be served I was a little worried, however everything came out within about 15 minutes, which is all right by my book. Food was great. Joe's Scramble and Eggs Ranchero had a lot of flavor and the pancakes were fluffy. Kids breakfast was a generous portion as well.

We had actually visited another breakfast place prior to stopping here but didn't dine there because they didn't have high chairs. Glad we came here :)< /Text>

Came in for a beer and stayed for the food and great staff. Very impressed by everything from the kitchen. Highlights were the fried quail, fish tacos, and the ahi napoleon dishes. Staff prompt and friendly. I wish I had taken photos of the dishes. Definitely stop in if you are hungry.</review>

<text>I really enjoyed my dinner here. It's on the expensive side of $$ at dinner. The service was great, not slow at all. It's the lights are low and that gives it a nice relaxed environment, balanced by the people laughing and talking on the bar. Definitely recommended.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Text>My boyfriend and I LOVED this place. Quick and friendly service, the food (especially the ahi tuna appetizer) was amazing, the mixed drinks fairly decently sized for 14 dollar cocktails (which I normally wouldn't care to pay that much). It's a bit pricey, so be aware, but the proportions are very generous and quality a solid 8.5 out of 10. Thanks for the wonderful night!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Played 18 holes the golf was the best part of Spindleshanks experience.
The breakfast food was mediocre, the Bloody Mary;''s way to spicy, The service was lacking The manager was very curt almost to being abrasive. The bar service slow. And the location of the bar is perplexing. Why face the bar with the street as the view when you can face the Lake?
Sincerely,
Buck<//Text>

12/5/18: DONT USE YOUR CARD!!!  I used my debit card and paid with cash for a tip, when the transaction posts I see the male barkeep with the brown hair added a 100 dollar tip. Wasn’t hard to figure out since I have the receipts still.   I call the owner to let them know his bartenders were stealing from customers and adding tips to credit and debit card transactions.... the owner could not produce any paper receipt to assist me, he has ZERO record, after I told him how sketchy this situation is he proceed to Tell me to deal with through my bank as he “cannot be bothered”< /review>

<review>Great local restaurant in the Tahoe Vista, Kings Lake Area.  Have been there many times for lunch which was always good, the sandwiches, salads excellent.
Last night friends and I went for dinner which was excellent.  We shared the Oysters Benoit, ribs and the ahi appetizers, they were served with hot baked bread fresh from the oven.  They have a full bar and good wine list.  We had a bottle of Rombauer Chardonnay, always pleasing.  We also splurged indulging in dessert , coconut & chelate ice cream served on pastries.  The service was friendly, efficient, the parking good and it was a busy Saturday night.  Prices moderate.  Definitely worth
a meal & drinks while in the area.</review>< Pics>

Nothing bad to say about this place, great location right the gold field. It's just that the food was just "okay". No complaints but nothing amazing either. Still a nice place to stop by if you're in the area though.<//Text>

A  big thank you to Steve and Gordon for allowing my wife , son and our three dogs to sit outside on Saturday night. You went above and beyond and allowed us to have a memorable family evening in Tahoe,  We love  the food and atmosphere at Spindleshanks  and will continue to come back again and again.< /Text>

Husband and I made reservations for Thanksgiving. The prime rib dinner and the traditional turkey dinner were both exceptional. Turkey and all accoutrements were cooked well and flavor was excellent. Service was great from our reservation made with Thomas to our server who was attentive.< /text>

Spindleshanks could not have been a better experience.  We came up from the bay area and had a group of 9 people on NY eve weekend. There were no places to eat without a reservation and Spindleshanks accommodated us with no hassle. The food was excellent and the service could not have been better.  Phil the bartender was great and Tim was probably one of the coolest, funniest people you could have as a server. Thanks to everyone at Spindleshanks for making our trip awesome.  On a different note STAY AWAY from Old Range Steakhouse!!!  The owner is angry, bitter, unprofessional and burnt out!!</text>

Had the French pear martini, a Bloody Mary and a spinach, onion and mushroom omelette which comes with Pico de Gallo and a fruit bowl on the side... delicious! All thoroughly enjoyable on a rainy winter morning. The staff was super friendly, too, and gave us some great travel advice for the rest of our journey.<//text>

< Review>
HORRIBLE! Ordered the Schnitzel was swimming in GREASE! Had the waitress call over the manager, the manager spoke to the "COOK" (there is no chef at this restaurant) the "Cook" said it was butter that the meat was swimming in. WHAT? 1. Even an untrained pallet could tell the difference between GREASE and BUTTER! 2. Even if it was BUTTER Schnitzel is not supposed to be swimming in anything! The meat should be cooked well with a light batter. NOT TASTING LIKE A CHICKEN FRIED STEAK! (that is a nasty dish to start with) The worst part was the manager's answer was "Uh huh" "mmmm" "well I will speak to the owner" REALLY????  That's it? There was no offer of let us get you something else, let me take that off your bill, NOTHING! Fine dinning, is not something this restaurant understands! Or serves! If you can't find a decent manager FIRE HIM AS WELL AS THE COOK!  This is the third time I have attempted to eat here. NEVER AGAIN! The food is subpar. Do not waste your money. This is a roadside dump, in the woods. If you are looking for something amazing to tantalize your pallet go to Dragonfly! Something always different, and there is a Chef employeed there!< /Review>

Frequently go here with friends and family. The flank steak with the chili relleno and the brick lemongrass chicken are off the charts.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Very good brunch, the bacon was a delight and the scrambled eggs a treat. The burgers were good too and home fries on top. Nothing to say about the food. However, the boss took 20 minutes to get us to the table so that we passed the 11:30 am deadline for breakfasts (pancakes and others). Besides, he was not very welcoming. Fortunately the waitress was great with us which raised the bar a bit. we really had a good time in a nice place 😊
Note that the "Cesar" salads are not at all the same as in 🇫🇷: they are mostly salad and chunks of chicken, nothing else 😔

(Original)
Très bon brunch, le bacon était un délice et les œufs brouillés un régal. Les hamburgers étaient bons aussi et frites maison au top. Rien à dire sur la nourriture. Cependant, le patron a mis 20min pour nous mettre à table ce qui fait que nous avons dépassé l’heure limite de 11h30 pour les petits déjeuners (pancakes et autres). De plus, il n’était pas très accueillant. Heureusement que la serveuse était super avec nous ce qui a relevé un peu le niveau. on a vraiment passé un bon moment dans un endroit sympa 😊
A noter que les salades « Cesar » ne sont pas du tout les mêmes qu’en 🇫🇷 : c’est surtout de la salade et des bouts de poulets, rien d’autre 😔</Review>

I really like the Al Pastor here, it's very good but lately I've been let down.  I ordered 5 tacos Al Pastor and when I got home they were carne asada tacos.  The next time I ate here I ordered a Carnitas burrito and half way after eating the burrito I realized it the carnitas was way undercooked and the meat was pink.  I like it here but not enough to risk eating pink pork again.< /review>

This place is fantastic. Very kind staff and the best pickled carrots I've had. Reasonable prices and also complementary pinto beans by the salsa bar.</review>

<text>Somewhat good food but the help needs to smile a little more!! You have to learn how to greed your customers!! I felt like I was interrupting their conversations and when asked to please put everything on my order  one of them gave me a dirty look!!  No thank you or come back again soon 😔Their menudo has good flavor but recommend to cook a little longer meat is  a little tough!!</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I just went to this place, the place was empty, the lady in the cash register was not doing anything, did not pay attention to us, and when I reached to ask a question about menudo. She didn't even let me ask the question, interrupted me, and said "ahorita te atiendo ok gracias" with such an attitude on her tone of voice. I told my gf right away, "let's get out of here". Customer service sucks here. The other reviews were right. Don't come to eat here.< /Text>

< Review>
Had a shrimp burrito here. Burrito was huge and delicious. Lots of shrimp and crema they put is very tasty. Ordered fish tacos as well not expecting the burrito to be so big. They were also very good. Phoned in the order but still had to wait but well worth it. So good, is the first thing that comes to my mind. I was lucky to get there when it wasent too busy, because sure enough the store had a lot of people. The Booths were comfy, And the service was friendly. I loved how they give you grilled cactus and grilled onion, those are the best. Here are some pictures.< /Review>

Great little hole in the wall, I've been here several times and there usually isn't a lot of people here most of the time. They have a smaller menu than most places, which I like make decisions much easier when going with pickier eaters. Staff is friendly and make sure that all food is made quickly and serves hot.< /review>

<text>Felt like I was treated different because I don't communicate in Spanish. I was then charged almost $5 for a medium horchata. My total bill between a wet bean and cheese burrito cheeseburger combo and 2 papa tacos a whooping $26. I have been here several times and was never overcharged the way I was today. I will not be returning because of the way I was treated today.</text>< GmapID>

Poor customer service.
Both times I've tired to order something they make me wait forever, and the worse part is they don't even show that they acknowledge me . it's not even busy when I come in .
I will not try to eat here again..<//Text>

I've eaten at so many taco places all over the place and I can tell you this place is nice, clean and good tasty food.  -  There aren't many good option to eat a good taco late at night so I found this place long ago and gave it a try since then I've been dining at this place for almost a year, they have a special I think is $7.99  - 4 tacos and a soft drink. - This place is clean and the food is better that the 'king taco' down the street.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c333dcff72a48d:0x16fd911505c5ec00< /gmapID>< rate>

<text>Food is very authentic, customer service was not only rude, but purposefully insulting to my date, which caused a bad attitude from her and that resulted in what??? Right, Noneya, didn't get squat... Lady that takes your orders is a troublemaker and needs to go.<//text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Bad service! far the worst customer service i have experienced!!! The lady at the register is a miserable rude lady and not friendly at all. Everytime you talk to her whe gives attitude and speaks in a rude way. She needs to either quit or stay in the back. There is no reason for me as a customer to have to deal with her attitude!! But that is not all she told me i can't get too many lemons, vegetables ect. "You can't get too many vegetables because the owner gets mad, the next time you do that, I will have to charge you" She rudely told me this and rolled her eyes at me. The burrito I ordered had more rice and beans than meat. Don't forget that business relies on customer's if you don't give good service how are you going to expect to get more money and customers.</Review>

I look at places if it was clean I will give her a hundred percent if it was attitude I give up for a 40% the food I look at that you know that taste the people atmosphere everything like that just be real with people you know we all human being live on this Earth for a reason we all have to get a loan but if you don't like me I won't come back that's why I gave you a 3-star I really didn't care too much for the attitude that I got when I came into the place but I did bring mention my friend to you to them about this place and they thought it was great but I didn't think the attitude and the service was sucks<//text>

<review>If I could give it less than one star I would. The food was so bad. It was cold and I think I had food poisoning after I had ate there. And for 10 bucks for a cold wet borito that makes you sick. I think I over paid.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

The cook she was polite but that at the register is a miserable rude lady!!!! Not welcoming at all!!!! She needs to either quit or stay in the back there is no reason for me as a customer to have to deal with her attitude!! Train youre workers to seperate personal &business separated!!!!< /text>

(Translated by Google) I have been here twice, it’s a very low key, no frills, Taco spot, but they have a vast array of different dishes to try! The staff is very considerate, and open to questions if you need help ordering. I have ordered here twice, and this time I had to leave a review! The first time I had the Carnitas and Asada tacos, with a side of fries! The fries came crispy! The tacos looked perfect, and they tasted even better! This time I ordered the fish tacos, and let me tell you the sauce they put on those bad boys will knock your socks off with flavor! They have a bar for salsa, lemon, and pickled veggies, with a hot pot for their charros (beans)! This is definitely my go to taco spot, they have great deals, and I can't wait until next time!

He estado aquí dos veces, es un lugar muy discreto, sin lujos, Taco, ¡pero tienen una gran variedad de platos diferentes para probar! El personal es muy considerado y está abierto a preguntas si necesita ayuda para hacer un pedido. ¡He pedido aquí dos veces, y esta vez tuve que dejar una reseña! La primera vez que comí los tacos de Carnitas y Asada, ¡con papas fritas! ¡Las patatas fritas estaban crujientes! Los tacos se veían perfectos, ¡y sabían aún mejor! Esta vez pedí los tacos de pescado, ¡y déjame decirte que la salsa que le pusieron a esos chicos malos te dejará sin aliento! Tienen una barra de salsa, limón y verduras en escabeche, ¡con una olla caliente para sus charros (frijoles)! Este es definitivamente mi lugar de tacos, tienen grandes ofertas y no puedo esperar hasta la próxima.

Worst experience ever!
There’s sign saying debit card only on station and it wasted me a lot of time trying different cards. The debit card payment could not go through at the cashier and the attendant had zero patience and won’t help anything to figure out the problem.<//text>

It’s 2021 and they don’t take credit cards lmao, it’s probably because they are too cheap to pay for the credit card insurance and fees. Employees didn’t greet customers at all. Only pros are it’s newly built and clean.< /Text>

I've been waiting for a gas station in this neighborhood for over 4 years. The inside has a nice clean design, atm and all your fav snacks. Competitive gas prices too!</Text>

<Text>The guys here are sweet enough.  The parking lot is an absolute nightmare and I can see a lot of people getting in accidents here though I was personally not witnessed any. Still waiting on vacuums so they did install air. they have a pretty extensive beer selection compared to other gas stations. Unfortunately like all am/pm's, they have a swipe fee (35¢) on debit card purchases (which is unlawful in CA).  Only accepts cash or debit (NOT credit).  They don't sell coffee creamer unless you're buying coffee lol.<//Text><UserId.>105157613964394325497< /UserId.></record>

I did a lot of research on aligners before choosing Candid, and I'm so glad I went with them. My visit was wonderful from start to finish! I was really impressed with their COVID precautions (something that was really important to me), and felt safe throughout the appointment. The studio was pristine and the staff were great about wearing masks and switching gloves to ensure safety and cleanliness. Everyone working there was super friendly, warm and professional! I can't say enough great things about the staff. Most of my visit was with Analisa and she was amazing! She was super clear about the entire process and made me feel very comfortable. Service is so important and I definitely felt like she went above and beyond. I left feeling happy and excited about my treatment plan. 5 well earned stars!<//text>

<Text>Great experience -- especially during a pandemic! The staff ensured that every step of our meeting was done safely and that I was comfortable the entire time. Analisa was the absolute best! She explained the entire Candid process, did my imaging and scans (so cool!), and really helped me feel like I knew what to expect next. I've had my eye on Candid for more than a year, and I left SO excited to start my treatment!</Text><name>Emily DeLapp</name><pictures>None< /pictures><GmapID>0x80c2bb1707e83d8b:0xf0a8cb9deec5876a<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had such a smooth and relaxing experience here today. All the staff went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. So excited to hear back about my treatment and I'm so glad I opted to due a scan at this Studio. My mail-in impression process was a little bumpy/confusing but working with Emmanuel and Clint made this entire trip worth it. Thanks so much!< /text>

Great, safe & easy experience. Analisa helped me in the kindest manner and made sure to answer any questions I had. The studio is taking those extra safety precautions, which I totally appreciate during these times. Looking forward to the rest of my experience with candid!</text>

{'time': 1601252416669, 'text': "Hi Mingzhao. Thank you for your feedback. Unfortunately, our Santa Monica location does not accommodate free parking. Per our website, if a case is accepted for free refinements, expect the process to take 2-3 weeks while the assigned orthodontist creates an amended treatment plan, and another 4-5 weeks to produce new sets of aligners. During this time, patients are expected to stay in their current, well-fitting aligner step. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call at 1-844-295-6915 or reach us online via livechat."}</Response>

This is WORSE than the WeHo location. There are only 2 reserved parking spots in the back and the workers here reserved it for themselves even if you've made an appointment. That means you'll still have to pay for parking. Also, it takes more than "24 hours" for the orthodontist to respond to you for a re-evaluation. It may take weeks.<//text>

I visited Candid Santa Monica and worked with Stephanie, Luke and Robert and they treated my friend and I like royalty. We were seen immediately and they helped us with our concerns with regard to acquiring aligners. The staff was very informative and the overall pricing is very reasonable in comparison to other companies like Smile Direct which offer aligners. I am very pleased with my visit to Candid Santa Monica and I look forward to an even more beautiful smile.</review>

<Text>I recommend this location for those trying Candid in LA. They’re not as busy as downtown; easy to book appointments & reschedule.

They were flexible with my schedule though I missed two initial consultations, and were proactive in reaching out to get me to come in.

Some wouldn’t enjoy the proactive reaching out, but I see it as good business sense. I think Candid at the corporate level has good management. They seem to be an up & coming company in dental treatment. Definitely want to support younger companies.

Because they are new, they are offering good discounts and incentives for people. They want to grow their name. I can’t complain as a consumer.

In terms of my initial consultation, process was very easy. Brushed my teeth and took photos and was able to decide quickly to go ahead with treatment. Great value proposition.

Thank you Panida for the great service.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I really loved the ambiance of the office. It's not like your typical dental office. I was immediately greeted by Daniela. Right from the start, she was super welcoming and friendly. Then, another employee Sean asked me for water. I love the hospitality! In addition, they're also dentist assistants who knows what they're talking about.

My overall experience was amazing. I understand all the terms and conditions and saw someone's profile and their changes. The reason they are able to offer affordable prices is eliminating all the overhead cost. They also use a scanner that creates 3D images of your teeth. Sean pointed out what I would generally need to get done which are some realignments and fixing my cross bite.

You should definitely give this a try and compare it to a normal orthodontist visit! Huge difference!</Text>

I went today for my appointment and was very impressed.  Modern waiting room and very clean.  Super charismatic staff and very polite. They offer discount incentives on top of the already cheap price,  so definitely go in. A 3D scan of your teeth beats any mail in imprint on my opinion. Plus they'll answer all your questions and walk you through the treatment.  Just go in and get it done already! Hands down worth it.</Review>

I went in for the screening, mostly to know if my teeth qualified for aligners, and walked out super excited about my future smile! Much thanks to Luke who had answers to all my questions as well as patience enough for my bad humor.

My dentist had told me I might have to pull out a tooth to get wanted results, but knowing that Candid have an orthodontists evaluating the photos and scan for my aligners convinced me to look no further- but to order asap!

The two reasons I haven't done this before I found Candid was simply that I didn't want to do the mold of my current teeth and bite at home (you know the one with blue clay..) and rely on my own ability to create the perfect print. I also haven't had the money to put down. Candid had my interest when they offered an in-person screening in their studio with a financing plan for $88/month only!

I am so excited!<//text>

I went in yesterday to get my 3D image of my teeth. I have to say that Raven, Breeya and Alicia were beyond nice. I was expecting good customer service but they gave excellent customer service. Raven was my specialist, she was fun and funny made it all so easy. There was a problem with my one of my scans disappearing but Luke came in right away and gave me options to make sure my process didn’t take any longer. I am beyond satisfied with this location and how amazing the staff is!</review>

This place is a scam. They make people leave reviews before they get their product. I’m at the end of my treatment with lots of gaps in my teeth and no one is responding to my emails. You’re much safer going to an actual orthodontist. You never get to meet or see the doctors there’s no authentication for this process besides the employees words. BEWARE.< /text>

This is a DOG BEACH where leashes are not required so don't expect to bring food with your kids and family and expect it not to get noticed by someone's dogs. Great place to go with loving animals and beautiful sunsets when it goes down over the mountain</Text>

<Review>Beach is nice. Great access for SUP'S & kayaks.   You will see diesel in the water and waters edge from the boats in/out of the harbor.

Like most dog friendly beaches, you do encounter the pet owner(s) who won't control their pets (unleashed) but insist on unleashing them on sunbathers, small children and others' pets (personal experience).  Dogs are usually friendly, but, scaring little kids & other dogs, not cool<//Review>< Pics>

Allows dogs all day and everyone is friendly! Awesome place to let your pup run as the whole beach is surrounded by rock cliffs. Would not recommend for small children or day trips when Avila beach is literally down the road.<//text>

<text>If you taking abt Avila Beach is great. There were so many beautiful dogs playing together having the time of their lives. And  Dog People  are the Best People.  They are friendly, happy, patient, very loving humans, so if you go to this pet friendly beach be prepared  to be treated as an equal. No one is higher than our beloved Dogs. Everyone looks out for everyone's dog. People on this beach respect that this is our beach to spend time with our Family Dog who is a very special Family member with special needs and this beach fulfills this need for us Dog Lovers to be with our Beloved Family Dog and people who believe the same way. My Dogs Emmie, Eddie, lily Bug are so Grateful to have such a wonderful place. Also the beach provides poo bags as to keep the beach clean. Please use them.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSVXqjfAeZP51UeUdv1GOQRuxSoIIvCQ4vEZMq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnEagpGLqqzjO3gUmYIBNjk_wfNnclT1_f1L8C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I’ve been here several times and never had a bad experience. All the dog owners are polite and understanding of the fact dogs are all different. Also Custom House about 5 mins away is a dog friendly place to eat after a couple hours of running around< /Text>

This is an amazing Beach for dogs. They are off leash and can run around in the water and sand. There are lots of balls offered as soon as you walk down the ramp. It's the perfect place to bring your dog pal and hang out without having to worry!<//text>

Bathrooms and easy Street parking, and easy stairs or ramps to the beach.  Lots of dogs enjoying the water.  We didn't bring a dog, but chose this beach anyway to watch the dogs play and get off the overcrowded beaches a bit.  There only about 20 stairs from our parking spot down onto the sand, which was easy for my little kids.  The bathroom was clean.  I didn't find any place to rinse sandy feet or hands.< /Review>

<username>Steven B< /username><text>Dog friendly beach populated nearby 100% by dog owners so no one makes a fuss when your dog behaves like a dog!  Many dogs off leash so expect free roaming dogs with friendly owners. There are bathrooms here but no other amenities. The beach is very windy. Parking alongside the road. Pretty beach.<//text>< Response>

Nice, rather hidden little beach. Sailboats on bouy 100M off the beach.

Sheltered from the larger surf by Pismo to the South, and breakwater to NW.

Dog friendly, families. Easy access down steps or drive/ramp.</Text>

<text>There are always a lot of dogs here, which I love. Me and my husband took my 7-year-old for the day. We had a great spot and my son had the best time. The beach was nice and clean and it's easily accessible from the road. It's one of our favorite places to go.< /text><GmapID>0x80ecf851832c37e5:0x2d68bc9a6f4220a9</GmapID>< Name>

So many dogs were running around having fun on the beach at night, and there were lots of groups using the dedicated bonfire areas. It’s a pretty magical place.</review>

Nice beach. Dogs allowed off leash. There were many big dogs running around when I went. They were friendly and we had no issues. One long staircase  going down. Didn't appear to be wheelchair accessible.< /Text>

<review>Our current favorite place to run some energy off. Weekdays after work we typically see between 5 and 15 pups. Weekends can be as many as 50. The traditional local dog parks tend to intimidate my gsd. This large, wide open space is great because the social dogs can run, bark, splash and wrestle. Leaving plenty of room for less the not as social to run or lounge as desired.< /review><userid>113709888531177928827<//userid>< response>

This place is a favorite of ours and our dog. It's so nice having an area like this to take our dog and let her run free and play with other dogs. There always seems to be parking. Everyone there is friendly. They have a bag station if you forget yours. Its everything you want in a dog friendly beach.< /review>

<Review>This beach is an awesome pet friendly spot on the Central Coast. Parking is rarely a challenge and the families here are welcoming and supportive to dogs and kids of all ages. I sometimes take for granted how great we have it here!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>Almost hate to give away this hidden gem of Pismo Beach. always lots of parking and it is where everyone brings their dog. If you don't like dogs getting all up in your business may not be the place for you, but if visits from friendly dogs would only make your day better, this beach is heaven.

Note, no services or amenities. No garbage cans, so hike out what you hike in. There are fire rings for use.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>It is a fantastic beach for dogs to run off leash. Lots of area so that you can walk off and put distance between any small personality mismatch that individual dogs may have. Almost as many people come to sunbathe as they do to run the dogs, and most seem to appreciate the dog friendly atmosphere. It is very close to Avilla Beach and Port San Luis if you want a little more human only interactions. Tons to do in the area, and it is nice to have a dog friendly place to add. Poop bags are provided!<//Text>< Pictures>

My dog (still training 1 year old)who was on a lease and had an off lease training device on could not move forwards or backwards.  As I asked for the owners to call back their dogs they laughed

Love, love, LOVE this beach! Friendly dogs off leash playing and enjoying our amazing coast.
Sadly, there are some that come to visit and don't understand the concept of an off leash dog beach. Yes, the dogs will walk over your towel. Yes, they will eat your food if you put it on the towel on the ground. It is what it is. If this is going to bother you, there is a lovely beach less than a mile away called Avila, where you have no dog issues to worry about!<//Review>

<Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80ecf851832c37e5:0x2d68bc9a6f4220a9< /gmapID><text>For kids with dogs.  Since I find the canines annoying, I am not too thrilled with them. It is another one of the few beaches that you can wade in.....but watch for hypothermia. The water in this area of CA, is super-cold and most will use wetsuits.  Due to prior extensive oil pollution in this beach, I would also research.  They had to replace the top few feet of soil in town due to this.

Anyway, the views here are nice & it is pleasant to walk barefoot on the shore.  Food & hotels are nearby & the 101 is just a few miles.
People can tend to clog the area when there are reports of Whales to watch.< /text><pics>None</pics><date>1516669158343<//date><rating>3<//rating><userid>111557884895470941076<//userid><username>Paul Malarik Jr<//username></record></dataset><record>

Nice low key beach in Avila.  Dog friendly, you can let your dog off the leash so they can romp in the sand and surf. Never really crowded, and during the summer there are fire rings so you can have a beach bonfire.</Text>

<Review>THERE ARE SO MANY DOGS! be prepared to be surrounded by them! All the dogs I've seen are good doggos who are friendly. Also a good place for humans to hang out who are dog-less and just want to see some doggos. It's relatively clean and lots of street parking up the stairs.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80ecf851832c37e5:0x2d68bc9a6f4220a9</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

It's so nice to be able to let our dogs run, swim, fetch, and play without having them on a leash.< /Review>
