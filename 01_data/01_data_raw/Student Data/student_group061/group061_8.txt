< Review>
We hired 1st Choice to pack our home and move about 45 minutes away. From the first encounter Derek was professional and responsive, he gave us a comfort level that made the choice to hire his company an easy one. His packing crew came in and had our 3000 sq foot home packed and organized in 7 hours which was a huge relief for our family. On moving day the crew arrived and were easy to work with and very professional, they went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with the services provided. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking to move.< /Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>These guys were great for my short move across town.  First of all, Derek was extremely responsive, answering my questions usually within minutes.  They provided a crew of 3 for the move.  Josh, Jose, and Daniel were very efficient and did a great job protecting all my valuable furniture and possessions.  They were able to complete my move in a little over 5 hours, and the price was reasonable.  I will definitely recommend 1st Choice Movers for any moves in San Diego!<//text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
1st Choice Movers were referred to me by the controller of a new company I work for. The controller  used them before & gave me all the details of pricing & discounts offered by 1st Choice.  I called Derek months later & the prices were exact. (Honest)  I sent several emails asking questions &  Derek patiently emailed me back , answering all my questions. (Patient) I scheduled the date & the movers arrived early. (Punctual)
Once they entered my apartment, the first words were Good morning and the 2nd were Ma'am.  Wes, Abe & Josh are the most organized, professional, kind and efficient movers I have ever encountered. (I move often due to the field of work I am in)  I had zero stress with this move. When, Wes gave me the final bill, it was less than what I had estimated it to be. You can not go wrong with these guys. The are top shelf with economical prices!!<//Review>

<text>I had a great moving experience with 1st Choice Movers! I found this moving service through some referrals on NextDoor and I'm so happy I did! Derek responded right away and had me scheduled to move during the time frame I wanted with no issues. He was quick to answer any questions I had before moving day as well. On moving day, Shaka, Jake and T showed up ready to work! They were a pleasure to work with and honestly made my whole move easy and stress free! Thank you guys for your help and I definitely will use them again for my next move!< /text></record></dataset><record>

This was the best moving service I’ve ever used, hands down. When they were short a man at the start of my move, Derek came to fill the role and make sure the times and estimates were still met. Lyle and T were professional, courteous and nice guys with a hard working mentality. The move ended up being an hour shorter than planned and nothing was broken or damaged. I will definitely use 1st choice movers in the future and refer all of my friends as well.<//Review>

This company came highly recommend by a friend, and my experience was great. The team (Alex, Daniel and Jose) was on time, friendly, very conscientious of wrapping and packing everything to be sure it didn't get damaged. They were very responsive to all of my questions and requests. There was one small scratch made on the new floor but the movers brought it to my attention immediately and the owner sent someone to fix the scratch within days and it looks like it never happened. The whole moving experience was very pleasant and easy and I was impressed by the integrity shown with the floor scratch situation. I hope not to move for a long time to come, but if I do, they will be my first call!</review>

All moved in and I want you to know that it was STELLAR service.  The guys were great: professional, good humored/natured, worked crazy hard, asked the right questions, actually took care with my stuff, and were overall just fantastic.
I'm truly pleased and can't say enough good stuff - for sure will recommend 1st Choice again; Jake Jerzy and Will get major props and it was cool to see them work well together.  I'll pass their names on to anybody who needs to be moved!  Excellent price too, came in /way/ under budget (hooray!)  You also have been great on the communication end of things, and I am a very happy camper that's ready to get life back to normal.  :) :) :)

For starters, Derek gets the ball rolling and is very thorough in quotes and explanations for what is covered in their charges and gets you scheduled nice and quick! He sent 3 guys for the actual move--Kris, Luis, and Sal--and they were efficient and careful with everything. They packed up extra items that weren't fully packed up and took care with them.  They took apart everything and kept all pieces neatly intact.  They were on the ball and kind. At the end, Derek realized they overcharged, simple mistake, but made that transition smooth and fast.  Highly honest people and I appreciate that so much in a business! I've never used movers before, but these guys will have my business for any upcoming moves that happen. Cannot recommend these guys enough! If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><time>1599691448502</time>< UserId.>

1st Choice Movers are AMAZING!!!     I needed a moving team at fairly short notice and was already worried about finding movers during the COVID mess.  Derek responded to my message immediately and said he could fit me in. The team who executed my move was amazing, professional and polite.  Not to mention, they were extremely careful with our belongings. I could not have had a better experience and am relieved to have a trustworthy company I can call on in the future. Thank you so much You guys rock!!!<//review>

<text>This is the BEST moving company in San Diego hands down. They show up on time wearing gloves and masks. The owner is Derek Parker and he will personally see your move to completion. 1st Choice Movers are punctual, quick, and careful with your possessions. Derek is very professional and caring. During this time, they even sanitize the inside of the truck everyday. I've had the pleasure to know Derek and his crew for many years, and there is no other moving company I would recommend. They are the best!!<//text><Rating>5<//Rating><time>1589562320232</time>< user>

<Text>I hired 1st Choice Movers based upon Yelp reviews and I have to say - they are all true. They are fantastic, hire them to make your move the best  experience possible.

1st Choice Movers - specifically Roy, Angel and Jose - made my move the most hassle-free, efficient and painless move of my life (and I've moved upward of 10 times in my adult life).

The team showed up five minutes early - even though I had been provided a 15-minute time range rather than a hard start time. They immediately got started with the red carpet treatment - and I mean that literally. They unrolled a red carpet runner throughout the condo to walk on and protect the floors of the condo. The team boxed up my *few* remaining unpacked items and even wrapped some breakable items to ensure safe passage.

Despite moving from a second floor condo to another new second floor condo with a bending staircase, the team was careful with all of my furniture and the walls. They moved fast, but not so fast as to overlook details or cause harm. At the end of the moving process (about four hours), they had moved everything into my new home (even put my bed frame back together) and while I was overwhelmed by the boxes to unpack, I wasn't stressed about making sure everything arrived to the new place in one piece. 1st Choice Movers made that happen.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbzOYYqPjxehlEgWLh57QE9yYDh_duWJWUgFUq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

I've used 1st Choice Movers twice in the last 4 months, and both moves were easy and smooth! I decided on this company because of the high level of customer service provided by Derek. He is very responsive to emails and extremely personable. His teams called both times with an estimated time of arrival, and were polite and courteous. They did their best to complete the moves as quickly as possible and were gentle with my belongings. I hope I don't have to move again soon but, if I do, I'll definitely use 1st Choice!</text>

This is an amazing service. I found them through Yelp and contacted Derek for a quote.  He was very responsive and helpful, made scheduling the move painless. The day of the move, Yusef, Jose and Sal were awesome.  They worked very quickly, and treated my belongings as if they were their own and they were so nice and friendly. Moving is very stressful, and these guys made it seem so simple.  Do yourself a favor and use this company for your next move - you won't regret it.<//Review>

Derek and his team did a great job in a prior move, so when we were doing a remodel and needed a temp move he was our first call. He came out to our house and evaluated our needs. He ended up recommending putting our stuff in a container rather than move out completely. His firm doesn't do container loading but he was very helpful in pointing me in the direction of someone who does as well giving me tips on how best to prepare. Call him for any of your moving needs!!<//Text>

I've had to move several times in the past few years and have always done it myself (rented a truck, asked for friends help, etc.). This move would be pretty big one for me and my husband - about two hours away from San Diego, and booking with 1st Choice Movers was the best decision we could have made to make our move so incredibly stress-free! Derek was the one whom we coordinated with and he was always quick to respond and clear with his communication. He was upfront about the cost and the final estimate actually ended up being a bit lower than what he quoted to us originally!

The day before the big move the packing team showed up - Brenda, Lily, and Vanessa. We were informed that they would arrive at 9am, but they were told to come at 8:30am from management - no big deal at all though, just a slight miscommunication (and coming early never hurts!). The three ladies were professional, super nice, and worked quickly. If they had any questions about whether something needed to get packed or not, they didn't hesitate to ask. We're currently in the process of unpacking at our new place, and we have yet to see anything that's broken or damaged. They finished packing up our 1 bedroom apartment in just under 2.5 hours.

The big move was the next day and Alex, Jerzy, and Lalo were the moving team - they showed up right on time. Like the packing team, they were professional and efficient. They were able to load things up in about 2 hours and unload in 1 short hour! My husband and I were amazed at how quick they were. We also did buy them lunch and expected them to take a longer break, but after about 10 minutes of eating they continued working hard. The total move day was about 5.5 hours for us (2 hours to load, 2 hours to drive, a little over 1 hour to unload).

If you have any anxiety about moving, definitely hire this team! They will put you at ease and allow you to have a stress-free move day (which I never thought could be possible before this!). We can't emphasize enough how each team member was extremely professional, efficient, and friendly.

Also, in these times especially (but even during non-pandemic times), if someone does an amazing job and you're pleased with the work - give them a tip! We tipped both of the packers and the movers as we were completely satisfied with their work.</Review></record>

These guys are great!  We contacted Derek about the move about a month before our moving day and he was prompt and attentive from Day 1.  We wanted to hire 1st Choice Movers, as we know they are the best and book up far in advance.  The team of Yusef, Jose and Roy that showed up for the move were fantastic.   They wrapped all our furniture with these thick moving blankets and did not charge for shrink wrap, our last company we hired ripped us off.  You can tell these guys truly care about their customers and it shows from the owner Derek, all the way down to the guys lifting our heavy furniture.   Thanks guys.  We hope we don’t move soon, but when we do its 1st Choice Movers that we will call.</Text>

These guys are ROCK STARS!!! They showed up early, were super friendly, professional & AMAZING! Example: when my sofa would not fit thru the front door they actually took it around the front of my building and brought it in over my patio railing. That may not sound impressive, but my  new place is on a steep slope. So these guys actually scaled a hillside to delivery my sofa! Believe every positive review you read about this company because it is all true.< /review>

<Review>Yesterday we moved houses and used 1st Choice Movers.  Our move could not have gone better!  Our crew was: Jose, Wes, Jerzy, Lyle and Roy.  They were on-time, fast, courteous, respectful of our houses and our stuff, and friendly.  Moving day started as a high-stress day for me, but their confidence and calmness made me feel much calmer.  I appreciate their hard work and great attitudes!  Also Derek was very responsive to me leading up to the move, from my first inquiry, to our consultation/walkthrough, to a follow-up question after the move.  THANK YOU 1st CHOICE MOVERS!  I will be recommending to all my friends!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

{'time': 1564950186379, 'text': "It's really unfortunate that your car was hit by someone and no one left you a note.  But your car was NOT hit by us or anyone in our company. Our small GMC cargo van was simply parked next to your vehicle in a parking spot, but we in no way hit your car.  The damage to your car was clearly caused by someone slamming into it.  We tried to help and communicate in every way we could, and even asked you if you had checked cameras in the parking area.  We can not take blame for something that was not caused by us, and there was NO damage to our packing van, at all.  You can’t assume or place blame, just because the van was parked next to you.  Your parking lot is very busy, with garbage trucks, etc, and it is very easy to see a company name on a vehicle and try to place blame, rather than to do due diligence.  I hope you truly find out who hit your car in your busy apartment complex, but after 6+ months, might be difficult."}</Resp>

< Review>
From start to finish, 1st Choice Movers did a fantastic job. I was helping my dad move into his new apartment (he lost his wife--my mom--a few months back), and Derek was great throughout the process. We almost paid another company that specialized in moving seniors a TON of money (it would have been over $3,000 if we went with them instead). But I told Derek we needed full packing and unpacking service in addition to movers. It ended up being less than a third of the cost than the other option, with packing, moving, and unpacking. Brenda and Sofia were outstanding; very efficient at packing and unpacking, and very friendly, especially to my dad. Jose and Josh did a fantastic job with the move; they were fast but careful, and also really friendly. So many things could have made this a difficult experience for my dad, but it ended up being just perfect. He is so happy, and that makes me happy. :) Thank you SO MUCH 1st Choice Movers. I will definitely be recommending you again, and calling you when we need to move.<//Review>

Most impressed!!!  Working with Derek over email to get things arranged was easy and painless. Then on moving day, Jose and Pete were terrific; they showed up exactly on time and were efficient, careful and courteous. I appreciated their eagerness to save time as they dropped off several big items at three different locations. No lollygagging for these two! Will definitely be using these guys again.</text>

Awesome move thanks to 1st Choice Movers. Scheduling the move with Derek was easy and all of the details were very clear up front. On moving day, the movers (Josh, Robert, and Sandy) were all excellent... professional, efficient, and friendly. Definitely give my highest recommendation to 1st Choice!</review>

This is the 4th time I've used 1st Choice Movers.  I've always been satisfied with their service.  They always take good care of my belongings.  On January 29, 2020, Abraham, Alex and Ogen moved me from El Cajon to Poway.  They were professional, courteous, friendly and fast workers.  They made the move so easy!

Derek is always responsive and helpful.  I sincerely hope that if you're looking for a good moving company that you contact Derek.< /review>

1st choice movers is an amazing company. I have used them several times and every time they guys who come are polite, professional and have great energy. Jasper and Silvester were my movers this time and they were fast and very helpful. I believe that this is because the owner Derek is such a nice guys so it makes sense his employees are also. I highly recommend this company for small moves, big moves and in between. I am so glad to have found a company that I know will deliver. I have recommended my mother to use them when she moves and she cant wait as its one less stress to worry about! With all the movers out there this should be your 1st choice. Thank You Guys you did a wonderful job!<//Review>

They were incredibly fast and efficient, didn't BS at all.  They were constantly working and making sure I didn't do too much of the work! I HIGHLY recommend using 1st Choice if you are in need of movers in San Diego. Bravo Derek!</review>< user_id>

Extremely pleasant and efficient movers.
And talk about integrity! After the move, I
complained that I couldn't find one box with about $150 worth of goods in it. (This was my fault-I had placed it in the wrong room) Derek, the owner, without quibbling, immediately sent me a check for $185, money which, when I discovered the missing box, I returned to him. But that he would do this, on trust, bespeaks
of the highest degree of character and
integrity. I would give this company the
highest rating. Definitely hire them!< /review>

I hope this is the same 1st Choice that was located on 900 F. Street.

I had the pleasure of working with Edgar, Roy and Anthony.  What an incredibly professional and genuinely NICE group of guys.

Not once did these gentlemen complain, roll their eyes or even make a SINGLE demand or request during the time they were there to move.

I've worked with "professional" movers dozens of times and I have NEVER SEEN a more professional and NICE group of movers.

I expected, as with any move, some groans about the heat, or complaints that the house wasn't completely packed, or that my friend wasn't really providing ANY direction to them, but not once did any of these awesome employees say a word or react negatively.

I would be PROUD to recommend 1st Choice to all of my family and friends.  They are PROFESSIONAL, SUPPORTIVE AND DO AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB MOVING QUICKLY AND NOT "KEEPING THE METER RUNNING"!< /Text>

<review>I have had the greatest dental experience in this place! Doctors and the stuff are always friendly, polite and professional. I am a patient of Dr Kalmanovich and absolutely love his way of work, as well as my hygienist’s. No pain, no discomfort ever. I will not switch my dentist or hygienist ever again. I recommend this place to everyone I know, and think that Laguna Family Dentistry is one of the very few places where you can get professional doctors, hygienists, assistants and an amazing customer service at the same time. Thank you!<//review>< Pictures>

Dr Kalmanovich and his staff are the best support I can ask for in my continued journey toward strong oral health. The team is great at answering my questions and helping provide a streamlined plan for getting better. The environment is safe and friendly. I highly recommend for locals and families.<//Review>

Amazing practice. Staff and doctor are friendly. They really take their time with each patient during the cleaning and the doctor also spends quite a bit of time with patients to make sure to educate the patient on all options and then develop a treatment plan together. I’m very pleased with my visit and will be referring family and friends here.< /review>

Two was exceptional as a hygienist. They identified the issues and addressed them rapidly and efficiently. Allison offered me a Pkg that saved me over $100.

I was having mouth, jaw and ear pain while visiting Laguna Beach from out of state,  and not even sure it was a tooth hurting or not, but reached out to LFD for help. They scheduled me for a new patient appointment for the first opening a week away,  but promised to call if anything opened up sooner. A few hours later, a cancellation occurred, they called and I ran right in. They could not have been friendlier, more professional, thorough, patient and knowledgeable! They took a ton of time with to dissect the problem, did super easy X-rays and provided great advice. If I ever need a dentist while visiting again, or heck, just for a cleaning, I would 100% come back to LFD! ❤️<//review>

<review>I went to Dr. Alex Kalmanovich about 9 months ago to put a bridge per his advice. Unfortunately, that bridge didn't work well and I started having issues with it 5 months later. I started having sever pain on one tooth which at that time he advised me to see a root canal specialist and was reluctant to see me.  It turns out that the base for bridge is too weak and an implant procedure would have been the proper treatment. After spending $4,000 now I have to do an implant and basically redo the whole thing since my bridge keeps getting loose and feels uncomfortable. I would stay away from this doctor.</review>< Pictures>

I am very thankful to have Dr. Kalmanovich as my dentist. He and his staff are wonderful. Very friendly and safe environment. State of the art equipment. He is someone you can trust will take care of you and your oral health.  I have difficulty sitting still for cleanings because my teeth are sensitive and they went out of their way to help me be comfortable for that procedure as well as for filling I’ve had done before.< /Text>

This was my first visit to a dentist in over 10 years. Everyone in the office was friendly and made me feel really comfortable. The COVID protocols were great and I felt very safe.

Dr. Kalmanovich was very nice and professional he explained everything and made sure I felt comfortable. Hayley did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth checking in with me regularly to make sure I was still doing well. I really appreciated that she explained everything she was doing as she worked.

Overall great experience and highly recommended if you’ve been hesitant to go to the dentist or are just looking for a friendly and comfortable place that you can trust to take care of your dental health.< /Review>

<Text>Seriously the best dental appointment I've ever had! HIGHLY recommend. This is a small office and it shows in the relationships they have with each other and their patients. Hayley Johnson is an amazing hygienist who worked fast, did a great job, and is really easy to talk to. I went in because I was told by another dentist that I needed a crown on a tooth. Dr. K took a look at my x rays and realized I only needed a filling. He fixed it quickly and painlessly, and I haven't had a single issue since. They saved me a ton of money in dental work and were SO nice. Definitely going back!!< /Text>< pics>

I absolutely Dr. Kalmanovich's work. I haven't been to the dentist in let's just say a LONG time. I was so nervous and had a lot of anxiety about getting my teeth worked on. (I had a previous bad experience somewhere else). You can tell Dr. Kalmanovich really does care about your oral health. He is super nice and makes you feel comfortable.

Dr. Kalmanovich and his entire staff are very professional and welcoming. The office is very clean and they are very on top of COVID protocols. Stacey is an amazing hygenist and did a wonderful job at my cleaning. Alison at the front desk is so sweet and is very helpful.

I HIGHLY recommend going to see Dr. Kalmanovich and his staff down at Laguna Family Dentistry!<//review>

I hadn’t been to the dentist in about 4 years.
I have always had bad experiences at the dentist so I was a bit nervous. Everyone made me feel so comfortable and safe. Dr Alex was very gentle and waited as long as I needed to make sure I got fully numb. I am so happy I found an amazing place with amazing staff.<//text>

Laguna Family Dentistry is great.  Everyone in the office is courteous, professional and friendly.  Dr. K provided great dental care in replacing a crown for me.  He was considerate and caring, asking how I was doing several times throughout your procedure.  He also followed up by checking in with me that evening to make sure I was doing okay.  I highly recommend Laguna Family Dentistry.<//text>

Absolutely wonderful experience at Laguna Family Dentistry. It had been 4 years since I had been to the dentist and they weren’t judgmental or rude, they took their time but I also wasn’t there for longer than I felt I needed to be, and they did not recommend services I did not need. Happily going back for additional services beyond cleanings and fillings.<//text>

All the protocols you would  expect for a safe visit are in place at Laguna Family Dentistry. Starting with the pre-arrival checklist every patient must fill out. Upon arrival only one person is allowed in the waiting area, a temperature check is taken, everything in the dentist office is spic and span and extra measures are taken for sanitization in the chair. As always the procedures run smoothly and professionally and everybody is there to make your dental visit a pleasant one!</Review>

I took my 1 year old son there for his first check up and cleaning and Dr K. was so patient, kind, sweet and gentle with my son. He explained everything to me before he did anything. The first visit wasn’t much, more so to get my son comfortable with the new environment and the staff and my son was a bit shy and nervous understandably but I think he did warm up to Dr. K and the staff by the end. The staff was wonderful and let my son hold the cleaning tool himself and allowed him to put it in his mouth on his own. So he did get a bit of cleaning his first visit, you really can’t get much better than that. Gina, the office manager was such a sweet heart. So friendly and easy to talk to and really cared about my son’s comfort level. Over all I think my son had a great first dental visit experience and this will provide the foundation he needs to keep up his dental health care as he grows up and not “hate” the dentist. I LOVE this place, it’s cute, quaint, nicely decorated with such an awesome staff. I’d recommend Dr. K to anyone and everyone! Can’t wait to go back for my own appointment next month!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><time>1510594034509</time><UserId.>117698584066982305099</UserId.><GmapID>0x80dce5b512c105af:0x346104b43c00b485</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Kalmanovich and the rest of the amazing staff in his office! After falling and chipping half my front tooth off, I was so concerned as I am not from the area, leaving me to rely heavily on reviews on the internet. I was able to get an appointment first thing in the morning, immediately referred to an excellent endodontic  (Dr. Boehne, also strongly recommend) for a root canal and then given another appointment right away in his office for the final repair. He did an amazing job repairing my tooth, to the point I don’t even realize I’ve had work done. I strongly recommend going to Dr. Kalmanovich for any work you may need done. It is evident how much he cares about the work he does, and his patients happiness with the end result.< /review>

So far, so good. I work in the dental/medical field as an IT consultant, so I have seen it all. This doctor and staff are top tier. They really care, take their time, and make you feel at home. No pressure. My wife and I will continue and also bring our son when he gets teeth.< /review>

Going to the dentist was never my favorite , until I got introduced to Laguna Family Dentristry. I just love the people and environment . Everyone is always friendly and polite. The office is always super clean and fresh. Dr. Kalmanovich is the best in his field. He explained all procedures in detail so I was very comfortable trusting him with my teeth.
What a great experience !!!

This is why I choose Laguna Family Dentistry for my own personal dental needs. Gina the Office Manager is diligent and very helpful with reminders and always has the office running perfectly on time. The Assistants and Hygienists are as wonderful as they are incredibly qualified and knowledgeable. The Doctors are Rockstars, they collaborate with each other and include you in the dental plan which I wasn't accustomed to but found very refreshing. They also utilize a lot of technology within the practice which is a sign that they are always looking for innovative ways to help their patients. Looking out over Laguna Beach while getting dental work done isn't the worst either.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Dr. Kalmanovich and his staff are friendly, extremely knowledgeable and caring.  I have had a new crown put in and have had my teeth cleaned numerous times in the past couple of years since Dr. Kalmanovich acquired Dr. Hawthorne's practice  Everyone here has gone the extra mile to be sure that I am comfortable and I understand everything I need to know about the procedure being done at the time.  I highly recommend this dentist and his staff.  They're wonderful!!</text>

<review>Dr. K is the dental Gold Standard
As the inventor of a nerve testing method, I am very critical of doctors because I work with them daily. I found Dr. Kalmanovich both friendly and very competent. The State-Of-The-Art he uses is impressive and certainly shortens the time requires to get things done. While eating dinner a 1970 crown came off my back molar. Dr. K fixed the tooth and made the new crown right there in the office. The 2 hour process from start to finish was almost pleasant and certainly painless. I give Dr. K and his staff top marks all around. I am so pleased to find a dentist of this high standard right here in Laguna Beach. No more fighting the traffic to go to Newport Beach.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce5b512c105af:0x346104b43c00b485<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Kalmanovich is by far the best dentist I've ever been to. I've been going to him for four years now and he is always genuinely friendly and does not make the dental process seem intimidating at all. He is very knowledgeable about new cutting-edge technologies which is quite impressive. He is able to make fillings or crowns right there on the spot so you don't have to come back to the office afterwards which is very convenient! Also, he does not try to perform unnecessary procedures. I came in with a painful toothache which might have needed a crown but instead he thought that a deep filling would work and after a few years of having it I have no pain and no additional procedures were required.

I feel lucky to have found Dr. Kalmanovich and his staff. Gina at the front desk is always so friendly, welcoming, and accommodating to my schedule and I love seeing Stephanie the dental hygienist. She does a very thorough cleaning and explains the cleaning process well.

I no longer mind going to the dentist and highly recommend Dr. Kalmanovich!</text>

In the past, for me, going to the dentist was a frightening experience due to painful childhood experiences. Dr. Kalmanovich, along with Christina and his caring staff, have alleviated all of my early fears.  With his compassion and skill, Dr. K manages to make all of his clients feel both at home and secure in his office.  I would highly recommend this  practice to anyone in need of expert dental care.</text>

We have been visiting Laguna for the summer. I was involved in a little accident and chipped a veneer. I did a quick Google search and found this amazing office! They were able to get me in right away and Dr. Kalmanovich was able to make a new crown for me the same day in the office. I even had a wonderful cleaning while I was there and the doctor called to check on me afterwards. If you have to go to the dentist, this is the office to go to! Everyone was just so lovely!!!< /text>

Love Dr. Kalmanovich and his staff!! I was referred by a co-worker, after I broke off a chunk of my back molar and they were able to fit me in THAT day. Being five months pregnant, I was nervous to get it fixed, but his staff was able to fix the tooth, while still being safe and mindful of my pregnancy. His office was able to 3D print the crown in house within about 30 mins. and I left with a completely fixed tooth within about an hour and half. The fact that I didn't have to come back on another day to get the crown put in was AWESOME!! I was really impressed!! Dr. Kalmanovich is now my primary dentist and I trust him and his staff completely. Everyone is very friendly and there is rarely any waiting once you arrive for your appointment.<//Text>

<Review>I went to Dr. Kalmanovich because my doctor was on vacation.    Turns out I had the best experience ever. I broke a tooth the day before they took me right in.  In the past a crown was a two part process. First day grinding, preparation, get a temporary installed. And then come back in a period of time to get the final crown installed.   With Dr. Komanovich  you get the crown the same day and inside of three hours. They have the technology right there to make your crown and install it so you don't even have to come back. Plus the people are so nice. I was so well taken care of.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Everyone who works in this office is happy to be there and you can feel it over the phone and in person. Allison was very pleasant and helpful. Her customer service is great!
The dental assistant was very friendly as well. I believe her name was Jos. You can tell the place is well mamaged and there is a continuity in good customer service and communication.
The medical equipment is great as well. The X-ray machine was crystal clear. You can see every detail, it wasn't a guessing game like the last dentest I went to.
Dr. Sarno was amazing. AMAZING! She is friendly and empathetic. She made me feel at ease and reassured me that she was going to take care of me. She is the 3rd dentist I've met with and I'm confident in her skills and most importantly she is trust worthy. The last 2 dentists were a bit extreme in their recommendations, but Dr. Sarno gave me a genuine and honest recommendation that had my best interest. She educated me thoroughly about all that is happening with my teeth and all the possibilities. The procedure was painless. I've had more pain flossing at home than I did under Dr. Sarno's care.
I've never left a dentist office feeling this happy and satisfied. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Had my teeth whitened at Laguna Family Dentistry and could not be happier with my experience. From my first visit, the entire team I interacted with were all kind, friendly and knowledgeable. My teeth are now white and look better than ever, thanks Dr. Alex!<//review>

<text>Dr Kalmanovich and his staff are great.  They are all very friendly and very responsive to any personal needs / dental problems.

Dr. Kalmanovich definitely keeps up with the science of teeth and gums.  Likes to apply the latest technology tools - for example, he has an amazing machine that can make you a permanent crown right in his office (no sending a mold to the lab and waiting a couple of weeks); and it was a perfect fit!

Now, he has a second Dr. in the office... (Dr. Samo).  She was very helpful in figuring out why my tooth hurt on an emergency basis.<//text><response>None<//response><pics>None< /pics><Date>1544217370490< /Date><GmapID>0x80dce5b512c105af:0x346104b43c00b485<//GmapID>< rating>

<text>These guys are the best!  This past summer, I was looking for a new dentist (when I moved down to South County) and someone from the pool I work at in Newport recommended Dr. Kalmanovich.  I've had a chipped tooth fixed, two cleanings, and some whitening procedures since August, and the experience has been great.  Alex is a super relaxed and capable dentist that helped fix my small dental emergency when I chipped a tooth, Stephanie and Leticia both provided great cleaning help, and for the first time, I feel like I actually kind of understood how to take care of my teeth at home. My work schedule is somewhat crazy and unpredictable, and Gina in the office was super flexible with helping me book appointments and stay on their roster. I also dig the fact that they provide remind me via email, because I'm horrible with voicemails.  If you're looking for a new dental care, this is definitely the place.</text>< pics>

Excellent service and very friendly staff. The hygienist  is extremely good at cleanings and they dont try to charge you for things you really dont need qhich is why i left my previous dentist. Strongly recommend anyone to try if your having any issues with your current dentist.<//text>

<time>1517288804400<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>Went to Dr. Kalmanovich's beautiful office in Laguna Beach and was pleasantly greeted by Gina up at the front and wow what a sweet and intelligent person.  Setting an appointment over the phone was a snap and she went the extra mile to make sure all my insurance stuff was in order.

The hygienist (my apologies I forgot her name) was gentle, thorough and informative throughout the entire cleaning process.  I never had an ouch moment and she even softly scolded me about my lack of flossing which I must admit I do need to do more often.

I then received a full range of xrays and had a lot less gag moments from my previous experiences.  Needless to say that's a plus.

Then Dr. Kalmanovich comes over and we go over the exam portion and the discussion felt like it was an old high school friend I haven't seen in years.  Once we completed the exam I was pleased to hear there will be no procedures that need to be done and he even gave me a referral for my sleep apnea which I've been suffering from for years!

Then back to the front to Gina that once again was very good at finalizing my visit and setting my next appointment.  Overall great experience, who knew going to the dentist would be such an easy and fun experience.  I laughed and had a fun experience when normally it's filled with pain and awkward silence.  Not here...you're constantly in a circle of great people communicating with you and attending to your needs.

I found a dentist office at last.</text>< pics>

<date>1427701421917</date><text>I hadn’t been to the dentist for about 7 years. I was afraid of all the things I would need to get done after not visiting the dentist for so long. Dr. Kalmanovich is very compassionate and made me feel comfortable right away.  He truly cares about his patients. He takes the time to get to know you, not like many other places that I have been to.
Since I had not been to the dentist for many years I had to get a deep cleaning done from Christina, the hygienist. She took the time to explain to me everything that I needed to know about keeping my teeth clean and as healthy as possible. She did an amazing job. My teeth felt and looked so much better afterwards. I was always self-conscious because of all the plaque I had built up over the years but she removed it all.
Dr. K has all the modern technology that make the visit that much more pleasant. There is a CEREC machine that makes the crowns in the office so no temporary is needed. You can get everything done all in one visit. I can’t even tell the difference between the crown and a natural tooth because they make their best efforts to match the shade of your natural teeth. Also, I know that x-rays can be a major concern because of all the radiation. However, Dr. K uses digital x-rays that use very little radiation. The x-rays allowed him to see things like cavities and infections that may not be visible to the naked eye.
Gina, the front desk manager, is very efficient at setting up future appointments and attempts her best to work with your schedule. They set up automatic emails and texts to remind you of your appointments. She also takes the time to sort out insurance stuff before coming in for your first appointment. The entire staff is welcoming, attentive and highly professional. Overall, I highly recommend Laguna Family Dentistry.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Dined in for a working meeting. Customer service was really friendly. Had the bowl with rice, steak, veggies  and tomatoes. Had churros for dessert and it was pretty tasty. The churro had some sort of filling, tasted like almond.<//text>< Pictures>

Came here while in the process of buying a car, it would be a great place to get lunch if you work in the area or are passing through. Full bar, lots of options and everything is prepared fresh right before you. There is done outdoor seating and a decent amount of space inside.<//Review>

Excellent!!! Food was fresh, service was speedy and very accommodating to my preferences and my very 1st here since they opened this location 3 years ago...Staff was friendly too and my over all 1st impression and rating is a 5 out of 5 since 10+ is not an option. I would definitely return again on my way in town. Staff informed me that they have 1 other chain location in San Leandro. I will stop by there as well if and when I'm in the area again. Kudos to this establishment, I was impressed with everything about the food served. I just wish it was more visible within the shopping center. 😉👍🏽<//Review>

<text>Very good casual spot for tacos. Thick yet soft corn tortillas, provide a sturdy base for a solid pile of meat and toppings. Great salsa, free chips. A small bar, with good options as well. Very fair prices.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Awesome tacos at very reasonable prices! The beer brisket taco was fantastic and it's great they offer tequila based cocktails and draft beer. The staff behind the couter were super nice and made my first time there a pleasant experience.

<rating>1</rating><Text>The worst Mexican food ever. The carne asada had zero flavor. Not even seasoned. The burrito i got was not even worth finishing. I also payed 2.25 for chips and salsa. I got maybe 12 chips in the bag. What a rip off. You can always judge a Mexican spot by their salsa and this place has no idea on how to make salsa. Will never eat here again.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>I was extremely impressed by this place. It's kind of like Chipotle but with more authentic Mexican flavor and ingredients. You go through the line to custom build tacos, burritos or bowls. It has all kinds of interesting toppings to choose from, like mango pico de gallo, Mexican cheese, and pickled onions. The carne asada and shrimp were delicious and they served chips and salsa along with the meal. They also had some refreshing infused waters and a complete bar.

The place is clean, modern looking and has some beautiful artwork painted on the walls that reminds me of dia los muertos murals. The kitchen/counter is bright and evenly lit, while the dining area is surrounded by the decor and has slightly moodier lighting. The staff was responsive and friendly. This was a very pleasant place to get a quick meal.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPemwL_m5ZZ1usQMZaP3YKaoNo831yrTdkENrfm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwgXh5oX54r8LfGSjYhN28qp2MDQ_q-dAsGXBl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqPicfduNDDvrLRPxNuBJEDyzIkIhJJ7MMfOjT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy3AdgAMPg_9ppSS8V-KhJS6KuygA9MrutMo_C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

Good selection, good  flavors and fast service.  Format  is like Chipotle - move down line and te them  what you  want  to  build  your  own taco, burrito or bowl. Pricing looks a bit  high until  you  see  the portions.</Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>The only thing that would have been better is having a few more options. Granted when places start giving you all kinds of options it can be overpowering, but I feel that if there were a few more choices it could be even better. Other than that, my only complaint was it would be nice to have a salsa bar available as the salsa wasn't spicy and I prefer mine to be as spicy as possible, but here everyone gets the same salsa. Price was decent and you get a good amount of food though!< /Review>< Pictures>

Checked online that they were still open. Says they are open until 8pm on the website. I get to the front of the place and their sign says they are open until 8pm. I go inside and told they are closed (there are several people waiting online). They said that today they close at 6pm. It was literally 6:03pm. Very disappointing and frustrating since everything they have posted says 8pm.<//Review>

This is the most increadable place that I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Food is wonderful anything you want on a burrito, you can have.i can't say it anymore blatantly but if you don't run over and try there food than your missing out on one of the most enjoyable Dining experiences you could have.
I truly mean this. So good.!!!!!.<//Text>

<text>Good tasty fresh food. Decent price, serves drinks, got some spice. I like the carnitas, its moister than I would have expected, but pleasantly surprised. Lots of good veg to add too. Not a big fan of the space as it gets super noisy when there are more than six customers at the tables.<//text>< Pictures>

Fantastic food! Everything was fresh and delicious: the tacos (especially the carnitas), the guac, the beans. Even the chips and salsa! Friendly service, too. Make sure to stop here. I only wish I lived closer.< /Text>

It's good.  Maybe I'll try it again sometime, but Sunday evening probably isn't the best time to go.  Some of the food was looking like it had a long day.</review>

Poor customer service. They dint shy to bill us when food was served to the table and when we were eating, wherein they could have wrapped up the billing before or after eating. Bar lady was uneducated on non alcoholic drinks.
Food could be more fresh, vegetarians would have not a lot of options or end up eating bunch of colorful zucchinis. For the excellent rating they have this place could perform above average in customer service and food. Average!</Review>

Passed this place a couple of times while going to Target in the same shopping center. Tortillas for the tacos are made fresh in house. You can even catch them making them if you come at the right time. Small menu, but we'll executed. Decent beverage selection as well despite the small location. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area and craving some fresh tacos.<//review>

First time here we had no idea the place was here for over a year. We enjoyed each experience the taco bar the welcome by the staff the awesome bartender great margaritas and fantastic food. We also watched as the other drinks and food was prepared a presentation was incredible better than most restaurants in the area that you would pay Triple anywhere else. Really appreciate spending some time with the owner< /review>

As an Oregonian it is possible that I just haven't had enough taco exposure,  but these were easily the best I've ever had. The thick, chewy corn tortillas they use are a totally different and superior experience.</text>

Went there for the first time today! DELICIOUS!!! Their Al Pastor and Carnitas are so flavorful. Highly recommend!
Update: had to bring it down 1 star. The shorter girl working there today has really bad customer service skills.</Text>

<Text>This is not a good place to go if you want to eat a good taco. When we walked in there it seemed really dead and low energy. I was under the impression that they were suppose to make the tortillas fresh. This was not the case. The tortillas were already premade and cold. The carne asada they placed in the taco was also cold. The “hot habanero salsa” had no spice at all. The table we sat at had food all over the ground. None of the staff even picked it up.

I can’t believe I paid $4 per taco. Robbed me of $20. Go support your local taco truck. This was trash food and service.< /Text><user_id>117836547207022522754< /user_id><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Incredibly well made food keeps me coming back. The corn tortillas are made on the spot with their own masa. They then grill them and make your taco(s). The Burritos are massive and delicious. Get the Cinco Sauce! Enjoy your Visit (s) you will be back!<//Review>

<Review>Amazing food! I was greeted by a quick and friendly staff prior to my taste buds being greeted with the amazing taste of authentic ingredients. Lots of seating and a full bar make this place very welcoming for lunch or dinner. The minimalistic and clean interior design of the location also make this a fun place to check out. The only thing I could comment on is that they're going to be slightly more expensive than your local taqueria or market, however the few extra dollars is well worth the meal you get!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808fe717edac3ea3:0x138415bc3514107e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Walked in not knowing what to expect. You right away see a bar and then the next counter is where the food ordering starts. Pretty cool that the make the taco tortillas as you are ordering. I also liked that you can get cilantro on your tacos without onion unlike most places. Juice from the meats on the taco are super runny so it may be messy. we had carnitas and carne asada, if you don't eat quick enough your taco will get soggy.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVGv7Kg3MiJ9p33rXTIDwzZMULHFzPwNjUxoCG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< rating>

Stumbled onto this place accidentally, while looking for another restaurant. It seemed inviting, with multiple patrons dining at tables on the little side patio outdoors. We ordered their individual tacos, which were good-sized, & you get to choose all the ingredients. We had ours loaded with carne asada, rice, black beans, salsa, sour cream, cheese, & more. They were mouth watering! Served with chips & salsa on the side, at no extra charge. They have a variety of meats, including pork & chicken. Loved this place, & we will definitely go back again!<//text>

Hot and fresh! Great atmosphere for casual dining.  Tortillas made to order for the tacos with a build your own taco, burrito or bowl option, choice of meat and unltd. amount of toppings making it worth the extra cost (of course guac is extra $). Beer on tap, small cocktail menu and tequila bar!  Will definitely visit again.<//review>

<Review>If you are a White person this is your place. Just because they make hand made tortillas it does not make a place that good.  I know taquerias that are waay better than this place!! I order a quesadilla and it was so simple that i would have been better off with a chalupa from taco bell.< /Review><rating>2</rating><user_name>Jose m. Lopez<//user_name>< date>

Always great and reasonably speedy. I think the tacos are the best followed by their burritos then quesadilla. Quality on par with Casa Orozca but at a fraction.
Love the infused water bar and carne asada.</Review>

Good quality food and friendly staff. You can customize your food with lots of options for ingredients. The carnitas was a little bland but still good. The music was too loud making it hard to hear the girl behind the counter. Overall good eats.< /review>

What every Chipotle franchise wishes it could be. Fresh ingredients, a very nice beverage selection (including those of the adult sort), creative options, and a friendly staff make for a very nice experience.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Quality food. Freahily made tortillas. Two key ingredients to perfect tacos. This place is newly opened and it is already a hit. The food here is so good, so at times there is quite a line out the door, but it is worth it. My only complaints could be the line moves a bit slower (freahily made tortillas, what do you expect?) And the price is a TAD high for something so simple. But hot damn they are good!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>The guys came to Livermore for the first time to visit me (I'm always driving down to San Jose to visit them), so I needed to take them somewhere really good. Cinco TacoBar delivered, and even my picky-eater-type friends polished off their burritos. I'm a big fan of build-your-own-burrito places, and this place delivers in spades, with a large number of fillings. In particular, this is the first time I've encountered a place serving fresh queso! Obviously, there were other things on the menu, but I went with the burrito. The horchata hit the spot right after lunch! Pro tip: Get it without ice, you'll get way more of your drink. Great place for lunch, maybe a bit on the pricey side.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Name>

Amazing burritos! Had a drink called pink senorita that kept a smile on my face as well. My only critique, no fountian drink dispenser. Plenty of regular can & bottle sodas, juices ect...
Had to get my daughter a really big snapple tea. The lime or Orange infused waters that they have on the counters for free are extremely refreshing. My family and I will be making a trip back for sure!< /review>

I really love the food at this place but unfortunately the customer service is getting so rude that it's to the point where I'm really turned off to even come here anymore. I'll be looking for a new Taco Place long story short.</review>

Wow,  Bravo.  Just finished my burrito and it was so good I felt compelled to write a review while I can still taste it. I had carne asada burrito and wife had chicken bowl with guacamole and both were fantastic and made to order to go in front of us. Spicy salsa too! They have a full bar serving mixed drinks which was unexpected due to the small size of the place. Drinks and bar looked very professional. I've been to 30+ Mexican restaurants in the Tri valley and this is instantly now in my top 5. Don't be fooled by small storefront or the old taco bell location,  it has my 2 thumbs up!  Clean stylish dining area too. 6/5 stars for my first visit!</Text>

A Chipotle for hipsters too hip for Chipotle. Food was ok, but not very flavorful. Taco tortillas were too small for the amount of ingredients piled on it. The dining area was far too noisy--it was difficult to hear other diners at my table during a busy lunch service. Ultimately, the food and experience didn't justify the price. There are better Mexican options in Livermore.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><review>A great spot for a Friday work lunch. Get here early or late, cause it's always busy. Nice mix of seating, decor and ambiance are nice. The food is the real star here. Made to order tacos, quesadillas, burritos etc with a vast array of customizable toppings. I've liked all the fillings I've tried, but the surprise standout is the grilled veggie mix. Corn, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and onions with beautiful carmelization, great in a taco or quesadilla. It's a good, filling lunch at a good price.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>This place looks cool, but the food is over priced tacobell. The meat honestly tastes the same. This place is a pretentious mess trying to do tacos with style when they can't even get the basics right. And the atmosphere was way to loud, save yourself and go to one of the other Mexican food establishments in the area you will be doing yourself a favor, and saving money.<//review><Name>Willard Onenarrd</Name>< user>

I went to Cinco Taco Bar looking for seasoned Carne Asada and what I got was bland chopped beef on a tortilla.  I asked for onions and cilantro and the guy sprinked 10 bits of onion and less than one stalk of cilantro so I had to repeat myself three times.  The salsa was cooked and I'm not a fan.  They also charge extra for avocado.  Overall I won't be making a special trip back.</Review>

Picked up a U-Haul earlier this week. This location has always been excellent the demotion to 4 stars was really not their fault as U-Haul had a major outage and had no way to know that we had a reservation or, once the computers were back, that this location had the unit available. This left us uncertain whether we would get our trailer. It also resulted in slow service made worse by one employee had just been hired and could do only limited things.<//Review>

Very impressive! Miguel, the young man who helped me was amazing. I really did not know what I wanted, and he stayed with me the entire time guiding me to the proper size and His customer service was top-notch. Then when we checked in he again stayed with us and made sure everything was perfect. The place is clean and well organized. I highly recommend this place< /text>

I just signed up for a unit at the Palm Desert location. The gate entry code I was given did not work. When I tried to inform someone by using the intercom button, it didn't work either. I called their phone number and was told the intercom hadn't been working for some time. (So why not FIX IT?)

The agent told me to wait a minute then he came back and said to try again. This time it worked. He was helpful when I asked for a different unit that would be easier to roll my motorcycle into.

By the time I left it was after office hours. I pulled up to the gate thinking a sensor would detect my car and open the gate. Nope. I called their # but had to leave a voicemail asking how to get out. I finally walked out through the door in the gate, entered my code to open the gate & got back in the car and left.

I have never received a callback from my voicemail to see how I got out or explain the procedure.< /Text>

{'time': 1589813580135, 'text': 'Since you came in the day prior to your expected move in, we did not have your gate code activated.  This is security function to ensure only current tenants are able to access our location.  The temporary code the team was able to provide was for that day only. When driving to the exit gate, your code should be entered again to open the gate, again another security function.  We have gate keypads on both the incoming and outgoing driver’s side – so you can just do it from inside your car when you pull up to the gate. The “lip” at the door of your unit, that the motorcycle had to roll over, is to provide a better seal when the door is closed so that there is protection against rain, rodents, and any other hazard. I am glad the original unit was still able to work.'}< /resp>

I had an excellent experience here. I rented a uhaul and a store-age unit. The young woman at the counter was completely swamped when I went in and it didn’t faze her. She was explaining my contract to me while simultaneously answering phones and greeting other customers. I was pleasantly surprised by her professionalism and she was kind to me which is a huge plus in customer service.  I’ll definitely come to this store again!< /Review>

This place has been so convenient and safe for my valuables. The people have been very helpful n generous with their time as well. The location is clean and welcoming as well. These 5hings I did no5 expect from a storage unit facility

Jaclyn and David are the bomb! Seriously makes my life manageable more than you know until it’s time to store ones things.
Thank you thank you n happy holidays to all...

I went in for a standard 10x10, but he was able to suggest a non standard size that actually worked better for me and saved me money every month in the process.

<review>After all the nightmare stories I had heard about storage facilities, I was amazed at how easy Security Public Storage is to work with!  They held my reservation with no deposit until my move-in time.  They have a friendly staff who is incredibly helpful, always cheerful; they are in a good location with easy access and so large that there is a good selection of sizes available.  I rented a large space until I can downsize, and then will move what is left to a smaller space where it will stay until I no longer need the storage.  I highly recommend Security to anyone needing storage.< /review><userid>115818792767796769393<//userid></record></dataset><record>

I have been a customer over a year and have found the people running the Palm Desert operation to be outstanding, something you would not necessarily expect. Just a great experience.</text>

I've been renting a climate controled space for a year now and am frequently in and out of the unit.  It's an interior unit and it's always clean and cool inside.  The grounds are also always clean and I feel very safe at any hour I need to be in there.  The staff have always been friendly and easily accessible by phone or in person.  I would recommend this place to anyone.< /text>

This place is Great!
Reserved my space ahead of time and they were ready for me when I arrived. They were very polite and professional and the space was excellent, clean, easy to get to and fully air conditioned and protected against the desert sand and they had a large dolly available for me to use. The space was reasonably priced and  is very close to Sun City Palm Desert for those who live there.<//Text>

First, we'll start with the personnel who greet you. Dana and Robert are great! They are so professional and knowledgeable with no pressure what so ever. Maureen and I selected an air conditioned unit which certainly made sense to us especially in 100+ degree weather. Today we extended our lease and it took all of two minutes. When they use "Security" in their name they really mean it -- the first entry I made on the premises I followed the car in front of me through the gate without entering my code. Within  a minute of entering my locker there was an employee checking me out to verify who I was, pretty impressive. Thanks SPS for your help and just being friendly people.

I've only been with Security Public Storage for a couple of months now, but since then, their service and explanation of how their facility works and operates was clear and concise.  Their rates seem to be equal or slightly below others in the area and the entire facility is clean and well maintained.  So far no complaints by me.</Review>

I had moved my things from one storage to the other and none of this storage give you the satisfaction of being a customer that actually pays for their salary. I tried Security Public Storage in Palm Desert. Not only that they are willing to answer questions but they are polite too. I moved my things with one of the units and felt secure.

july 17, 2018 and the air conditioning is still not working in the P building. The company didnt tell me, i had to find out myself. The air has been out for al least 2 weeks. If you have things in the P building you better check them today. BTW, i was told i could just move my stuff out if i didn't like it.< /text>

Very helpful and friendly staff, and security as stated in their name is one of their huge pluses. Someone on site 24hr a day. (To monitor the facilities wellbeing not for regular operating hrs services) large gate that requireds a password in and out and alarms on every unit. It's not the cheapest but you get what you pay for.<//Text>

<GmapID>0x80dafbea4e3b4e7d:0xe40f2a023937fcf8</GmapID><text>My husband and I just moved to Bermuda Dunes a month ago, and quickly found Security Public Storage. We weren't sure at first if this was the right storage place for us, and we've used other companies in the past. We talked to Robert on the phone, and once we heard that the managment lived on site, and that each unit has it's own alarm.....we were sold. We went down immediately to look at the units, and the service we received from Robert and Brenda was unparalled to any other service I've ever received at a storage facility. They were friendly, quick to help us, and most of all; up front about all costs. There were no hidden fees which we LOVED. I would strongly recommend this facility.< /text>< resp>

Mike was super quick to respond to my calls. We enjoyed working with him, great customer service! We had him do a full service and are thrilled with the work. Installing the bird screens around our solar panels was a must and Mike did a terrific job! Totally recommend using them and will most likely call them again when we need gutters cleaned and windows washed. Super happy with this experience!< /review>

<review>MIKE WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND RESPECTFUL.  WORE SHOE PROTECTORS UPON ENTERING HOME AND WORE A FACE MASK.  DID A GREAT JOB CLEANING THE WINDOWS INSIDE AND OUT.  ALSO DID A EXCELLENT JOB CLEANING THE SCREENS.  DO NOTICE HOME IS MUCH BRIGHTER WITH THE CLEAN WINDOWS.  WOULD USE MIKE AND HIS WIFE AGAIN.  I WISH MIKE ALL THE SUCCESS IN THE WINDOW CLEANING BUSINESS.   HE IS VERY GOOD,  MY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SURE.< /review>< Resp>

I loved the service you have provided. He (unfortunately I don't know his name) did a fantastic job. Very professional, had his mask on and kept his 6 feet distance. Also after the job was done, he explained in detail what was done.  I really appreciated it. Looking forward to the next scheduled service, window cleaning. Thank you again.< /review>

“You get what you pay for” is apropos when using Hikari window cleaning! Mike and Samantha run their business like true professionals. The combination of their easy to use appointment system, communication, coordination, and attention to detail are a few of the reasons why we will continue to use Hikari for future services and refer them to our friends, family, and neighbors.

Thanks Mike and Samantha!< /Review>

Mike and Samantha are a husband and wife team. Together they did my windows better than anybody we've ever hired. The last people we hired came with a team, were here for a very short time and it was obvious. Mike and Samantha came out to give me an estimate. They were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They gave me a quote that was very reasonable. He also said he would make a new screen that I needed for one of our upstairs windows. That was extra, but not much, and totally worth it. Samantha did a great job of vacuuming my window sills and cleaning the screens and Mike washed my windows. He did an amazing job. Not one squeegee line on any of my windows. I have never seen them look cleaner. I highly recommend Hikari Window Cleaning. Not only is their service excellent, but I love giving the job to really great people.</text>

I was super impressed with the service that Hikari Window Cleaning provided. Mikey was very thorough, affordable and professional. I had all the windows (inside and out), screens, and tracks cleaned. I didn't realize how much I needed it until he was done. The windows were so clean, it was almost like they weren't there. We will definitely be using him again.</text>

I just had my windows cleaned by Hikari and they did an incredible job.  I’m extremely happy to be looking outside through crystal clear windows again.  They are respectable and trustworthy, and I’m having them back twice a year from here on out.  Thank you!!!</Text>

<Review>We had them come out to clean our windows, gutters, and solar panels. They did an awesome job! Everything is shiny and streak free. I can't believe how much better my house looks now! I will definitely have them come back for regular service going forward. Highly recommend!</Review>< Pictures>

Great service! Responded immediately and was able to come out next day even though most other places I called had a long wait time,. He was quick, efficient, wore a mask when interacting with me, and prices were fair. Definitely recommend!</text>

Mike and co were extremely professional, personable and respectful of our property. Our windows look AMAZING! And our solar output has increased. I have tried cleaning my windows in the past and, although it took the dirt off, I always left streaks. Mike did not. They look CRYSTAL CLEAR and BEAUTIFUL! We 100% recommend them and look forward to using their services in the future.<//review>

Hikari Window cleaning did an awesome job cleaning my windows, I had just bought this home, and did a lot of upgrades, so I was worried with
all the painting and saw dust, it wouldn't come off, but to my surprise, my windows are sparkling clean, I really appreciate their professionalism, keeping in contact with me, being more then on time, and finishing beyond my expectations, thank you Hikari for a wonderful job, and I will look forward to having you back for more detailed work in the future.</Text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Maybe it’s just the location but the stores deals are a little higher than other locations I’ve been to, overall the FOOD IS STILL VERY GOOD, but I find that the only time the foods affordable is during a sports promotion. Breadsticks are so-so and if it wasn’t for the points earned on the Pizza Hut App for free ones, I wouldn’t buy them they taste a little hard. I only got to this location if I’m super hungry.</Text>< pictures>

You need better bakers. I've been ordering pizza these past few weeks and all the pizzas looked the same. They put a little bit of marinara sauce and cheese. They have to put a good amount of sauce and cheese. It didn't even taste like pizza it taste like bread. I'll rather buy groceries and make my own food at home so that I could save money and cook my food to perfection. Good food puts you in a good mood. This is how you lose loyal customers who support your business. I'm not ordering pizza ever again. I had enough of ungrateful people. You don't deserve a job. Very disappointing.<//text>

The employee working on New Years morning was being rude and unprofessional. I’m a 21 year old and she asked to speak to my dad. I don’t even live with my dad. This is just unacceptable and very unprofessional.
To top that off we received our pizza cut incorrectly and all messed up.<//Review>< Resp>

The worst experience I have ever had, the manager is completely unprofessional. I called for delivery, they messed up my address then called me and told me after an hour and 20 minutes I was told that they can't deliver to me and they will give me store credit instead of even refunding me my money. I live a mile away from this location
I told them that It was unacceptable and forced them to give me my food which took a total of 2 hours to arrive. I will be notifying corporate of this. They should of atleast offered me a refund. Nothing was done and left me with a very bad taste about the pizza Hut franchise. I can't believe they think it was okay for my family to starve for 2 hours and then tried to cancel my order. There was not even an apology issued< /text>

< review>
Ordered online for pickup. Was ready when we got there, but when we got back and actually tried the food it was terrible. Pizza was barely cooked. Center was just dough and falling apart. You sort of expect a standard food when you order from pizza hut, but this was so bad we just tossed it. Highly disappointing when you're craving pizza.
Will never order from this location again. With all of the other competition may never order from Pizza Hut ever again to be honest.<//review>

Tried to order online, card wouldn't accept. So I called in for the 2 for 6.99 mediums. Delivery from Tustin St Store  to Santa Ana, Ca. was fast. Pizza were soooo small. Ordered 4 pies and they look as small as individual pies. It was for a corporate meeting. Not enough food. Extremely embarrassed and disappointed. #Donttrustthesize #PizzaHut< /review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I ordered 2 medium pizza with thin bread, and they were horrible! The too hard bread was thrown in the trash my children could not even bite it hard, I would not recommend this restaurant I spoke with manager Alex and his response was as lousy as his product.

(Original)
Pedí 2 pizza medianas con pan delgado, y estaban horribles! El pan demasiado duro las tire ala basura mis hijos no la podían ni morder de lo duro, no recomendaría este restauran hablé  con el mánager Alex y su respuesta fue tan pésima como su producto.</Review>

Worst service ever.  It is TMobil now but the reps must be from sprint cuz I have always had a good experience at TMobil. They were just argumentative and disrespectful,  Go to the one on the other side next to Ralphs. Three young insecure girls all teamed up and started claiming I my tone was aggressive when I questioned the quote I was given.<//Text>

<text>My hotspot didn’t work. After 7 times calling sprint and it wasn’t successful. I came to this store. They told me the issue was my phone and they tried to sell phone to mw instead of helping me to resolve the problem. I have been in apple store recently and i know there is nothing wrong with my Phone.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2bb79cad9e74f:0xbce14b838c1319a7</gmap_id><time>1594403190066<//time>< Pictures>

< review>
Me & my wife joined Sprint at the end of February. I checked my charges for the first time today, 7/20, & just found out we are getting overcharged between $40 & 50/ month. Contacted Sprint online chat, discussed the issue  & asked for credit & was told they will look into it. I checked some other Google reviews & noticed we were not the only customers that got charged for something we didn't subscribe for. I'm personally going to the store tomorrow, hopefully store manager who opened our accounts that evening on 2/20/2020 is there & can explain where extra charges came from. Shame on him! & no point that evening he would even ask "how are you?", no "thank you", nothing... Just a blank, serious face of somebody who doesn't want to be there... Writing report to BBB tomorrow.</review>

Extremely poor customer service.  Went in to upgrade my phone.  They gave me incorrect info about my account.  They had very little knowledge on what items they had in stock.  They had even less knowledge on their new products, including the phone I purchased.  They had to give me the employee guide because they didn't know anything about the phone.  Also tried to make a return days later.  That was an entire other disaster.  DON'T GO TO THIS STORE!

Good luck cancelling Sprint too. Even if you own your phone and want to go to a new carrier they make it almost impossible. They will hold your phone hostage and not unlock it (to use for a new carrier) unless you jump through all kinds of hoops for them. Took me 5 days...Utterly ridiculous! DON'T USE SPRINT!</text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>There were some nice experience workers here. Until they quit and got inexperienced workers. They seem to NOT listen to my concerns and because of that, this sprint ended up costing me $$$. I called Sprint to take my roommate off my family plan since, he was leaving the country. They told me I needed to take him, and bring our IDs. We googled this store and went. When we asked about getting him off the plan, they told us we didn’t need our IDs to do that and that I didn’t need to bring him. The Sprint rep (She) did something on the computer. Then she said he was off. The next 2 month I was paying $7 extra for keeping a number I didn’t need anymore. I went back and told them I wanted my roommate and the number off my plan. Then the manager told me I need to bring him with his ID to get him off the plan. *eye rolls* but at that time, he was already out of the country. I had to do this whole back and forth with Sprint and complained with the manager about how his staff doesn’t listen. They did the same thing when I said I wanted to BUY a flip phone. They ended up leasing it to me. I ended up paying more than what the phone was worth.</Review>< user_id>

<text>Jordan helped me upgrade today and made the process so fast and so easy, she mirrored both my devices and I couldn't be more satisfied. Thank you Jordan haven't upgraded in 3 years because I wanted to avoid the hassle but I'll be going to her for future upgraded! I recommend everyone to go to Sprint on overland and Washington for any inquires and ask for Jordan. Thank you again!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>At first, I was really happy with the friendliness of the staff at this store. I came in to transfer my phone number, upgrade my phone since the sound stopped working on my old one and I was eligible for an upgrade, and get a new contract. Jordan P. assisted me, along with some help from one of the managers, who left the store midway through the transaction. I was told that all of this was possible and that I'd have my new phone attached to the number I'd been using for the past 12 years within the hour and that Jordan would call me to make sure that this happened. After I left the store, I never heard from Jordan and never started receiving the calls/texts from the number that I'd been using and was told I could keep using. I called her after a few hours and she incorrectly told me that everything had been transferred over and that the call she received was from my correct phone number. I tried calling and texting friends and was told that they were not receiving texts from my regular number and that when they called my regular number, it didn't go through. I called Jordan back and she asked me to hold on for a moment. I waited on hold for 45 minutes and she never returned and in the meantime, the Sprint Store closed. I then got a call from a Sprint representative who informed me that my number had been claimed by a Verizon user. I have been on hold/on the phone with Sprint and Verizon for the past 4 hours, and it doesn't look like I'm getting my number back. This has taken up my whole day when I was told it would be something easy that would be done in less than an hour. I'm disappointed with the incompetence of the staff at this store and feel like I was flat-out lied to and then avoided.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< pictures>

<Text>Amazing customer service!! As soon as I waked in Alfonso greeted me and made me feel welcomed. I came in just inquiring about the service and he got me to switch over to Sprint 😊 If you visit this store he's the guy to see.

Came in Just to get information! I spoke with Ana she gave me all the information I need to make the switch. She even broke down the benefits of why I should move over to sprint. She also broke down my monthly savings. So you can say she is extremely knowledgeable, quick, and very professional. I would recommend her to my mother and grandmother to work with her. Thanks Ana you're the best!!!</text>

horrible bait and switch, this is why people are leaving sprint. DO NOT GO HERE they will add things to your account without your permission and say they never did it!  I went over to ATT and switched over. better service, better reception, better EVERYTHING!<//Text>

< review>
I was in a real bind with my phone situation.  My phone was in pieces, no insurance, still owed for the phone, at the time I had been without a phone for 8 days.  I had been to a different Sprint store earlier in the week and also had talked with Customer Care on the phone and both basically had said that I was going to pay $400 + up front to get a new phone.
I walked in and to my surprise there was no wait, Dwayne was prompt to greet me and find out what I was in need of.  I explained my situation and was waiting for the bad news.  But this time I was given an option other than pay a lot out of pocket. He said I could add another line to my plan and get a brand new phone to use.  Although my bill would go up slightly more a month, it beat more than $400.
At this point Alfonso, the Assistant Manager overheard my situation and said he could help even more.  He went above and beyond to make things happen for me.  He got me upgraded to a better plan at not additional cost.  Alfonso got me all set up with a new phone and toys to go with it.

It took some time to get it all done because of my situation and it also required Alfonso to make some calls to Sprint Care in order to get everything in order.  He had no problem taking an hour to get everything perfect and in order.  I know some people walk in the stores and want the sales team to snap their fingers and you are out the door.  But it takes time. (Make an appointment to be safe)
When I fist walked in there was only 1 other guest being helped.  So I got helped right away, I considered myself lucky because I didn't have an appointment.  As guests came in they were promptly greeted and helped.  Caesar and Jordan were both conversing with me about my phone situation but were quick to help the guests as they came into the store.  I will be going back to see this crew whenever I need anything dealing with Sprint.</review>

silver lining:No one was able to help me as efficiently and pleasantly as Christianne.
First of all she was really fast, but she took the time to listen to my concerns and she really found the best plan for my family.

I was so impressed, I brought more people to her store to her.
Who wants to wait forever at a phone store or hear useless promotions?
She really respected my time and needs and addressed them.

I am really please with her service. I would not hesitate to go back if i needed anything else.

Sprint is the absolute worst carrier. Do not use them if they are being bought out soon and do not care about the customers they are just trying to make as much money as possible while they are still in business. Trust me do not use them!!!</Text>

I had the worst experience in this store. Costumer service is the worst. If the assistant manager Britney trying to help you, just walk out of the store or get someone else to help you.Otherwise she will keep saying clam down and not help you with your stuff, the worst part is she won’t even let you talk to her manager.< /Review>

<Text>Horrendous, incompetent customer service. Not only did the five people "working" not know how to handle my issue (emails not pushing to my device), but they deleted my email account without informing me that, in doing so, they would be deleting all of my Notes as well. Unretrievable and not-backed-up, I lost 92 items that I needed and valued. When I called in to ask for assistance, I spoke to a man named Antonio who was extremely rude and apathetic. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he'd call me back and he never did. Not only is this store unhelpful, they're a liability. Do not trust your technology or important data to them!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

(Translated by Google) I did win it because my husband bought a phone. I don't know how the purchase deal was. I think it went well because he was happy.

I love this place the washers that cost 10$ work really well. The man who runs the place is always busting his butt and is super friendly and helpful ! I come all the way from Clovis over here to give my business they also have laundry soap and freshener all your needs ! They are super clean with the convenience of a smoke shop and liquor store next door. The dryers don’t cost much either and work really well !!<//text>

<text>This is THE BEST laundry mat ever! It's never too busy, always clean, rarely see any broken machines, and FREE DRY with any wash! The guy who works there is so nice, he helps folks bring laundry in/out to the car. Two thumbs up! Keep up the good work!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I’ve been coming here for about a year, it WAS great until today! The new attendant is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! She refused to give me change until I showed he all of the things I wanted to wash first, then accused me of wanting to steal quarters even having 8 loads of laundry, I told her if I need change I can go get it from the car wash, she gave me 20$ in change( even though I asked for 30$) and told me if I need more go to the car wash!!! I just got off work and am to tired to drive any farther from home NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME HERE! They lost all my respect and my service!< /Text>< Pics>

Clean laundromat with about 5 sizes of washing machines and a lot of large dryers. Single load washers start at $2.50, 2 load sized tumbles are $3, etc. The dryers are free if you use their washing machines. The space was a cool temperature (100F outside when I visited), and there are a bunch of ceiling fans moving air around.</text>

<Review>I love there wash house, it's family oriented and it's clean and it's cheap and when you wash, it's free to dry. Please let them know though too please clean the lent from the dryers so people can get in and out, that will bring more money in by doing that. That wash house makes me happy i can tell you that much. It's good to me.< /Review>< Pictures>

I have found this to be ,by far, the cleanest laundromat that I have been to. That would even include the ALL NEW,everything Super Clean Laundry, right up the street. Then add in the price difference and I will be more than Happy to stick with Happy Wash and Dry!!<//Review>

<Text>This particular Little Caesars make a decent pizza. I been to other ones in past and this location surpassed them. The staff are nice but be aware when calling in a order make sure  you make the person say out the order and have gather your info. I have experience two different incidents when my order was not in they system but have records of me calling.< /Text><GmapID>0x8091b22ccf78f71b:0x1bfafb0098b4ff47< /GmapID><Name>Cesar Elenes< /Name><date>1598063261749<//date></record>

<review>You know there's times where you go in to a place and you have to wait because it's not ready, usually they say oh 5 minutes blah blah, you wait and your food is fresh and ready for you to go on home and enjoy it.  Then there's times where the food doesn't come out right and you then experience the quality of the establishments  customer service.  Well tonight I went in and waited an extra ten or so minutes after the 5 i was told I inspected the pizzas myself as I do every pizza joint and the cheese was burnt and I asked for a new one they tell me I'll have to wait ten more minutes. Or some free sauces smh step your cooking game up and serve this town some pizzas. The toppings are cheap and that's the reason we end up coming here so at least make it right for customers to enjoy. My 17yr old said it's tough enough to break teeth. Sorry kids but next time a refund will do.<//review>< Time>

<text>Horrible customer service! Didn't tell me what I was paying for therefore charging me for extra toppings I didn't want which ruined my pizza... I asked if they had Hawaiian but I said I wanted the three meats but they added pineapple and didn't tell me that they added it....inconsiderent and no effort in customer satisfaction</text>< pictures>

And they run on their own set of rules.$ 7 for a $5 pizza sauce is tangy straight from the can. The extra pepperoni is not like the TV commercial. Hardly ever any hot and ready pizzas made. All young teenage staff some think they know everything which calls for a very unfriendly visit from time to time.</review>< Pics>

A safe space where folks experiencing homelessness can get a hearty meal. Showers, restrooms, clothing, and other community outreach services are also offered by a collection of some of SF's very best volunteers.< /Review>

I first started going to Martin de Porres with my friends to get lunch because they would fill up any containers that we brought with soup. It is unlike any soup kitchen I have ever been to because there is a patio where you can eat and smoke outdoors, the servers are friendly and accommodating, there is a minimal wait, and the food is delicious and wholesome.<//Text>

This is the place for free food breakfast n lunch.  The staff are always friendly and helpful considering they are all volunteers.  And no one is turned away and always seconds if you're still hungry.  Please look into volunteering if you can great cause and wonderful people can't say enough about this place.  Charlie runs the place and he's a saint truly.😉😂😃< /Review>

It's a beautiful and amazing, wonderful place to relax and enjoy yourself with people who are like yourself and also the volunteers who come too give a helping hand are people from all walks of life different beliefs and culture come together to get United in helping one another out. Also it's a place too get away for a little while, and you are looking for just a soothing, loving conversation or your in need of good advice that's the place to go. And they are the only place that opens up at 5.30am too serve hot tea and some pasteries. And at 6.00am it's nice and hot and steamy with a verity of fruit a bowl of oatmeal also a good and organic wholesome lunch. Now that's what I'm talking about when your homeless, feeling down and out or even just curious and want to know what is St Martin de Porres hospitality house is all about you don't have to be homeless too go and eat or like I said just curious well come on in and enjoy yourself.</Text>

Always lots of oatmeal. Always free. And a variety of eggs, bread, fruit, tea, doughnuts, for homeless and others. A quiet sojourn from cold and the bustle.< /text>

This place is so special. There's no - security people, and not once have I seen trouble. I'm sure that there has been. But at places like glide(👎) which has guards, that just made me feel like.. I was a low-ly, scum, etc. I love Martin's.
I always feel welcome, the food is great, and they give me at least- a whole loaf of the bread of my choice..oh, and they also have Medical people on Thursday. All are welcome,🙍👫👭👬👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👨‍👧‍👧👩‍👧👨‍👨‍👦.< /review>

< Review>
Martin's is both a great place for eating and a great place for volunteering!  The organization is entirely run by volunteers and funded entirely by donations (it receives no city, state, or federal funding.) The food is delicious and largely vegetarian. The service is kind. The garden is beautiful. It is a very special place.< /Review>

< Review>
The people who serve the food are great people who absolutely care about you. Its a family that you never had. I myself was a volunteer for over 4 straight years at a inner Mission district food pantry and hot meals. Its a very valuable experience. I learned how to love all people, no matter where they are from. Martin De Porres has the same volunteers who love all people, because we are all one people, one very large family. By the way they provide showers and toiletries. Call in for more info on times and days for the showers and toiletries.

Thank you,
Adam</Review>

I did not have toilet tissue some times, but? The toilets in mens' restroom to close  so you would think someone will pull your leg; even the one near the exit Males were cleaning
themselves using the sink in the restroom: brushing teeth.   The soup was to hot and a time some spicy hot.  They except donations, let you take clothes used and books when there are some, volunteer and shower. There is only one shower.  Two separate restrooms: Male and Female There was a concert once while I was homeless. 1 of the band members let me have a shaker.  They do not charge money.  All You can eat until closing but you must get in line.  The give you a ticket you give before entering dining room.  You can take away food in container.  Have you own or they will give you one when they have one to spare.  Customers some speaking Spanish.  There is a piano you can play sometimes.  They pick it using padlock. Are them serving your meal, using a machine so they can clean dishes. Before that scrape leftovers into a trashcan and dish staking.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Bismallah! A Place I know I can come and always feel have something to eat and be full afterwards. Being in a hard place right now I don't always have money for food, and being vegan. There are not always very many veggie options for free eats around town. I know I can come here and get food anytime.</text>

Is it regular Sunday fare, or my dumb luck.
Each Sunday I have visited, they served black eye peas.
I need to come in on other days, I've heard great things about their soups and other fare.
I hope it isn't just wild exaggeration.< /Review>

As a person with underlying health conditions I avoid physically eating at restaurants and consider only quick and safe food pickup. El Tomatito is one of the few full restaurant (Not fast food) that has a drive thru window allowing for a quick  food pickup from the comfort of your own car.  Highly Recommended<//review>< Pictures>

Expensive for tortilla chips with sauce and small amount of cheese. No flavor! No seasoning no salt nothing! Only breakfast items available. Overpriced and NOT worth it. I wouldn't mind paying $9 if it tasted good. Very bland. I like flavorful food. Don't you? 👎</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

We're to start lol. Well I had a chile relleno burrito and all I can say props to the chefs here every bite was like an explosion of flavors I was able to taste everything from the chile to the beans to the cheese even the rice. Just writing about it is getting me hungry. Second there "cafe de la olla" (coffee) is honestly number 2 in my opinion in san diego haven't tasted just a traditional and delicious cafe de la olla. This is a must try place to experience how good it is.< /Text>

After a long day of hiking, we ended up here and so we were hungry by the time we arrived. The restaurant was busy, but that was a sign that the food was fine, so we were not discouraged.</review>

Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the food and the friendly atmosphere. It took a bit for my food to come out (10 minutes) but when it did it was hot,  fresh and very tasty. The staff was super helpful in helping me select what I wanted. I highly recommend this location to anyone passing through.< /review>

Chilaquiles are delicious I ordered the California Burrito this time and it was very small for the price it was and I asked for a refund by Victor the manager because I did want the food anymore untouched I was disappointed by the size and they would not give me my refund for the 6-7 inch long burrito I would not recommend that all but other than that. Unhappy experience. Never had a burrito this small and barely any meat 👎never going here again and will recomend my coworkers, friends and family somewhere else more worth the portions.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Food is ok.. just a little pricey. 1 breakfast burrito and 1 Birria burrito plus 2 coffee's came out to 30.00.  I mean if your really hungry and there's nothing else to then yes I recommend this place.</review>

The food has no flavor, is expencive, and if you like cafe the olla, they put anis, not my favorite., beans the taste like they open a can of beans and warm them up with  pork grease.</Review>

<text>Good service, clean place , I wanted to like this place because of the image and reviews, but its your average low quality Mexican food with bad soggy beans and overcooked rice, bad salsas and the only flavor in the food is the salt thats in it. I liked the service a lot, but I won't be back bcse I have no interest in eating that food again.<//text>< Pics>

Just went to that place expecting a lot more. Before the tacos were better. I payed almost $20 for 6 tacos de birria. Ultra small tacos with no meat. I know we are in a pandemic but come on they can't be taking advantage of people like that. Very bad experience. Next time I drive a little bit more to a good truck. Way better quality and cheaper price. Is you want over priced bad food go to this place.< /text>

<Review>Pros: Clean place. Food was fast. Very friendly staff. Food was average/good. Cons: No parking, all other stores next door have their spots marked and it seems like they will tow you if you park in theirs. Menu it's overpriced for a fast food taco shop. Prices are equivalent to a dine in restaurant.</Review>< rate>

Food was great, I had the green chilaquiles, good portion. My son had pancakes, they were cold. Service was good, costumer service was good. Prices were a little bit on the high end for what we had. Its a good place overall.<//Review>

If I get Mexican food anymore I go here because it doesn't classify as the generic dishes that sometimes seem a bit "slushed together" but truly fresh tasting. My only complaint is that I've noticed their food can be a bit on the salty side. If you have sensitivities to sodium you may want to take that as a precaution but aside that, Their food, especially Birria, is good enough to not make me want to try it elsewhere!</review>

< Review>
I came here not knowing the name of the restaurant had changed,  previously San Marcos.
Tomatito has a super clean,inviting atmosphere.
Great taste, decent prices and friendly staff.
I will definitely come here more often.< /Review>

Very good food. Good ambiance. You can say this is authentic Mexican food. Price is a little high but worth it. Biggest drawback is the lack of parking.</text>

Spicy Hungover chilaquiles are bomb!
Only reason to 4 stars is because they took to long to get my food ready.<//Review>

<Text>This place is a hidden gem! Could not speak more highly. Their birria tacos & other birria dishes are DELICIOUSly amazing. The tacos were very genuine Mexican tacos; I felt like I was in Mexico eating them. And their cafe de olla is fantastic. Staff is also friendly. Had a great overall experience & highly recommend.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Better than average Mexican food, friendly service, good prices. This place is kept very clean as a good restaurant should.

There is very little parking, so choose your time wisely.</Review>

< review>
Not many mexican places are packed on a Sunday at 1pm, but this one was so there must be something about it. To my surprise, I didn't expect that. The menu has a more limited and different offering than a taco shop. It obviously is for breakfast/brunch, and they do a good job at it. I tried the huevos divorciados, and although it is simple, it was quite good. The beans are good, the potatoes on the soft side, but I would have liked the salsas to be a little spicier. Overall, this is a great place to have a mexican brunch.<//review>

<Review>I ordered chilaquiles sunny side up with chicken (2.65 extra) the egg white was raw and running clear; there was no chicken, took it back and asked for a burrito and didn't even get refunded for the extra 3 dollars. Ok service..though  not impressed at all.<//Review>< pics>
