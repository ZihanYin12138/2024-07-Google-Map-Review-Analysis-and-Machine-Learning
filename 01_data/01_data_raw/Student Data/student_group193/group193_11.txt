<text>This was our first time visiting Precious Paws so we were nervous as to how our dog will behave. He came out looking and smelling nice. We will definitely go back. We got a haircut, nails trimmed and bath for $49.00.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>I had very bad experience at this place. I took my two cats here for grooming. I paid $130 for 2 cats. I expected decent hair cut.  My cats were ugly... Just bad hair cut. One of my cat was not even finished... Angie the manager and the groomer is not a good stylist and hard person to work with, I end up asking her to do it again next day... She said okay, so i called her next morning around 9:30 a.m. but Obviously she didn't want to work with my cats anymore, so i asked her for $50 reimbursement for my older cat. she said she will call me back. The owner and her decide not to reimburse. I was not satisfy at all, so i asked for $30 reimbursement. i waited around day and a half, i called her again. She said she can not! I understand the work she put into...but just maybe she should just do dogs~ I am pretty sure all the cat owners will be unsatisfied of her work... Just  not good work. I am sorry for saying this here but I had to... for the future cat lover customers. I end up taking both of my cats to elsewhere have them redone. Due to this~Now my cats have not much hair! They will be cold T.T Thanks for reading.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2d67455d0ee8f:0x8606bad1de54fc74<//gmap_id><Rate>1<//Rate><name>Gucci Aqu< /name><userid>111361457792261024758< /userid>< resp>

Made an appointment for my dog. Took him in at 11:00am they said we will call you when he's ready. At 3:00pm I called to see if he was done. She says no another hour and a half. What ?! No, never mind I will just pick hom up. When I get there I ask for him and she saus oh we have to dry him because he peed and we had to wash his feet. I said no that's okay I will just take him. She brings him out and his face is all wet. ?! I was so damn mad, I don't know what they do to the animals here but, I will never bring him back. What he peed on his face?!</review>

My shih-tzu Otis gets so excied when he goes to get groomed. The owner is a very sweet lady. I'm very happy with this groomer.  Otis always looks wonderful and he gets lots of compliments.</review>

The haircuts were amazing, best in the sgv. I'm amazed that people are willing to sacrifice getting a astonishing perfected cut for 4 dollars which is 35 to 38 the starting rate at a few places,. Then people end up spending more money at their vets  because of hotspots or razor  burns, here they haven't had an issue with fleas infestation or kennel cough since they first opened and that's because the place is kept clean and disinfected, so by all means if ur dog is considered part of your family  please don't risk an injury for a 3 or 4 dollars, take him to a place where your best friend is their priority and won't kill your wallet, thanks guys for taking care of mojo.<//Text>

<Review>This place reminds me of my childhood,Friday night pizza with my siblings! Featuring a brick wall, checkered table mats, blackboard walls with stylish writing on it (the menu) a semi open kitchen, (90’s style) soda fountain and even an old skool (sit down) 80’s arcade game!
As for the pizza itself: they do pizza by the slice here which I appreciate. Heavy cheese that’s distributed more from the center and less near the crust. I like the pizza here a lot I only mention criticism for aficionados. Somewhat typical “New York style” I see around la but less big and less thin. I can tell they use very good ingredients. They don’t seem to be trying to do anything radically new or different but that’s kind of what you would want from a place like this.

The staff was really polite and seemed friendly.

The price point is very good. (For the area especially) $3.00 piece of cheese, not absurdly big but big enough to feel I got my money’s worth. If the slice was bigger I would make it a point to come back again and again. For now I would pick Roccos over most other places in the area.
I like the 90’s ninja turtle vibe, the price is good, the quality of pizza is rather good. It has a homey feel to it. Definitely a solid place to have a work meeting at.

Definitely business meeting and also sports bar vibe.<//Review>< Pics>

Was really expecting better. I was really excited to try out some good NY pizza in LA, saw the reviews here and thought I was in for a treat. Sadly I was underwhelmed by this pizza joint. I ordered the 10” Hawaiian style pizza, the prices are typical for non chain pizzas around LA but the taste wasn’t anything too special. As far as the restaurant goes it’s pretty nice with a cool vibe, service is alright and everything is made fresh. Don’t know if I was expecting too much for if NY pizza just isn’t good on the west coast. Overall this place is a good place to eat a decent pie.< /Review>

Service was phenomenal and the pizza was delicious. I had the pleasure of being served by Angie, who made us feel at home. Please don't leave bad reviews just because it's not "New York" enough for you, you are in Los Angeles.< /review>

This is my first time here, and the experience was fantastic. They've got decent food and helpful workers here. Now they were my dream pizza joint. They also had a large range of toppings and ingredients. Their price is very competitive with other pizza restaurants in the area. I'm sure I'm going to bring my whole family here this weekend, and let them taste their yummiest pizza!</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Great neighborhood joint vibes!

Their chicken parmigiana sandwich is slightly different than what you might expect, instead of a single breaded filet it's cut into strips. Lots of flavor and texture, also piping hot.

Highest recommendation for pizza, sandwiches, and salads.

Outstanding service and helpful attitude towards new customers.

Televisions in the windows so you can watch Monday Night Football while grazing across the menu. Two major thumbs up for pandemic innovation...<//Review></record>

<Review>The place, the environment and the service were fairly good, however the pizza was salty. Perhaps I was the lucky one, but other than that everting was good. People minded their own business and everyone seemed very polite.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw1YC6Cr6CngST_TnfyM2PzSP7D6LXU3wsd9hQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtGejkA32hK8UDk7kn467SUbszdk2p3L2fQW8e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_C51Vsmj14Tmxac3IH1ULDOhNQr8uDNNJi_aX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>I love this place.  We always get the classic Rocco's Neighborhood Pizza and the buffalo wings.  The salad is great.  I just love this place.  If I had to pick my last meal it would be a little start deep dish.  I also go to the little star on Mission and the food is just as good there.  I like the Mission location because there is more light and it is easier to park.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The products are new and there are invigorating flavors. Try a must. Dessert is a must, too, to save your appetite! Maybe this isn't the best pizza you've had in your whole life, but it's still decent and reliable.<//Review>

I need to find a pizza place to meet up with my client. Luckily,  I found this Pizza restaurant with great helpful staff, amazing, and most importantly satisfying food. In totality, definitely good for value for money with a casual and relaxed atmosphere. The best Pizza restaurant in the town! Thank you so much!<//Text>

It was really hard to find such a qualified place with my taste. I am deeply impressed by how they handled their service correctly with no hassles at all.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I was the only customer around 3:30pm.  Sadly, the employee seemed a bit irritated I was there.  Went ahead and ordered to go.  Salad and pizza.  Nothing special.  Could have been a Dominos pizza and I would not have tasted the difference.<//text>

Second time here, just as great and used my previous yelp review to order the white pizza again. Love the thin crust, great garlic tang and topped with seasonal veggies. Also love the spicy chicken wings, great heat, not greasy dunked in the blue cheese=scrumptious. Wine selection, on tap, is great. If u don't want to travel to tony's in north beach try this restaurant.<//review>

< Review>
Excellent pizza. Usually I am not into deep dish pizzas, but the vegetarian was absolutely amazing. It was a little dark, but it was a nice ambience. The size of the pizza was good for the price and the house salad was good for two people! I also thought it was strange that it was cash only. WIERD.< /Review>

<text>Their deep dish pizza is everything it's rumored to be and more. So so so delicious.

I highly recommend getting it to go though. The place smells very B.O. meets patchouli oil meets day old marijuana smoke. Plus, pizza makes the best leftovers. I don't feel so bad paying $20 for a small pizza when it's more than enough for 3+ meals.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b93927cc7d97:0x7ee08e5634a72a72</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Not sure if I was starving but we ordered the thin pesto pizza ($20) and I was surprised by how much I liked it. I do wish the cheese had more pull but it was good! Will definitely go back and try the garlic bread and some of their other pizza choices. It was pretty crowded on a weekday night but even without a reservation we snagged one of the few empty tables left.< /Text>

<Review>The pizzas here are quite tasty! I love that they are fresh and wood-fires. You can truly taste the quality. The service was also efficient and quick. We waited no more than 10 min for our pizzas.

Definitely recommend coming here, could be a great date night.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2b93927cc7d97:0x7ee08e5634a72a72</gmapID><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< name>

Little Star is some of he best pizza I have ever had. There is nothing I can say here that hasan't been said a 100 times in other reviews. Can't go wrong here, even as a date spot for pizza the ambiance is really nice too. I really like their cornmeal pizza crust<//Text>

I've been coming here for years and the corn meal crust deep dish pizza is amazing. The "Classic" (sausage, onion, mushroom, pepper) deep dish is a must have here. The wings are also delicious if you want an appetizer. My last meal here I had dessert for the first time at Little Star, usually I'm too full after pizza, and the pumpkin cheesecake I had was very tasty and seasonally appropriate. I now live in Washington DC and I like Little Star so much that I make it a point to come back when I'm in town.</text>

After your first time here, you'll find yourself CRAVING Little Star pizza. It's all about the deep dish crust at this joint. Golden, with the "just right" crispy on the outside, soft on the inside CORN BREAD CRUST. Yes..I said CORN BREAD!<//text>

Amazing food! Couldn't believe the shrimp was 100% plant based. Tasted real and delicious. Shrimp scampi is a must! Along with the buffalo cauliflower. Meatball sub was fabulous also! Have been twice so far and will go back often! Great to have such a great vegan spot in this location!</text>

There is no best pizza..it's a very personal opinion and mine is that the thin crust here is the best I've ever hard. Deep Dish here is better than anything I've had in Chicago. Bottom line - you cant go wrong.<//text>

Albany spot, but I enjoyed the same cornmeal crust and bottomless pie over here.  I still think Paxti's has them beat (it's the greater cheese to sauce ratio), but paired with a Blue Star Wheat, this is a not miniscule star.  I also finally tried their chicken wings.  I was generally impressed, but they were a bit puny.<//Review>

Was in town for the LACMA and searched for local favorites and Rocco's popped up. If you like a good pizza pie or some ridiculously fresh, soft & hot bread then Rocco's is a must. My girlfriend orderd a slice of cheese pizza and it's seriously the best cheese pizza I ever had, so much flavor. I ordered the ravioli and calzone and once again was very impressed. It was slow when we went so service was quick. Parking garage located behind restaurant.<//Text>

<Text>Deliciously done! The pizza and pasta that I ordered from this restaurant were really good. The cook who did it deserves to be recognized because it was really tasty and mouthwatering. I really had a great time here eating my favorite pizza and pasta and I would be glad to come back again soon. THANKS!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>Rocco’s is FANTASTIC 👍
For months I went to my physical therapy appointments in the building next door to Rocco’s and finally one day I thought .. I have a little time, I’m going to try it.

I always get their lunch special. A half Greek chicken sandwich, which is wonderful. Chicken can be bland but this chicken has a nice flavor with fresh veggies, lettuce. Tomatoes, red onion , green peppers and feta cheese with their original Italian dressing on the side & it’s fabulous. I think they must bake their own bread too because it’s wonderful. Fresh and soft. Really helps make the sandwich.

I really like their chicken noodle vegetable soup too.
Not too many noodles or veggies. Broth is good. I ate the soup many times when I thought I was coming down with a cold. It helped & I always enjoy it.

It’s all fresh food.

They have pizza 🍕 specials on tues & Thursday at 9.99 for cheese and then a $1 a topping so I’m going for the pizza on Tuesday.

And.. they just built the cutest outside area with twinkle ✨ lights so you can sit outside & eat in a nice environment with some privacy.

I really like Rocco’s I hope they stay in business & can get through this time of uncertainty.

If you’re looking for fresh delicious food give them a try & support a local business. 👍<//text>< pictures>

It was ok, but did not live up to all the hype. I got the classic which was recommended by the waiter, but was unimpressed. I will give it another try, but probably go for the thin crust.</review>

< Review>
Little Star had a 45-minute wait for a table, but the four of us in our group already expected that. It's clearly a popular spot, and it was a Friday night. We ordered the large Classic deep dish pizza (23" with sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green bell peppers) to share when the hostess took our name after she told us that it takes 30 minutes to cook.<//Review>

Came here for pizza pi (3.14) day!! Deep dish pizza -- so yummy!  There was a wait and our pizza took forever to come out but definitely worth it once you take a bite.
Ordered: deep dish pizza (half BBQ chicken, half little star) $30<//review>

<text>After finishing up the school year with remote learning, it was awesome to continue the end of the year with tradition.  Rocco’s made it possible to have some normalcy this year.  Yummy pizza and a movie via Zoom with my second graders was such a thrill.  Thank you for making it possible Angie, Peacock and the whole crew at Rocco’s.<//text>< pictures>

The ambiance at this Valencia classic is really fun. The whole restaurant is done in dark wood and the bar has really cool light bulb lights over it. There is usually a wait, but you can call ahead to get your name on the list.</Text>

<text>I'm fairly critical of Italian food. In the worst possible way. I tend to think of it as simplistic and uncomplicated, and therefore, something I can "do at home". Unlike more complex dishes with more diverse ingredients (ie. Cambodian food), I can look at an Italian dish, figure out what makes it tick, and make it at home. For pennies on the dollar.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2b93927cc7d97:0x7ee08e5634a72a72<//gmapID><UserId.>112973092972546922867< /UserId.><date>1591332017481< /date>< resp>

Spent my birthday with friends there! They were really sweet and gave a nice dessert for gift ;) a little sad that they no longer has the mushroom risotto but everything else is still really good! Hope they can have the risotto back!! It's my top 1 to-go dish there</review>

I had a classic deep dish and have nothing but positive things to say about the pizza. Wouldn't get this that often since it cost around 20-25 for a small pie but would not hesitate to go here again if I'm craving deep dish pizza.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Five stars is not enough.   I decided to host a last minute holiday party this past weekend at my home for about 25 guests, and Rocco's did an amazing job of catering for me.  Not only was the owner, Angie, and her team members I spoke with (Zac and John) incredibly responsive, kind, and helpful, but they called morning of to confirm all of the details of my order and delivered promptly at the promised time and assisted with set up.  Reasonable prices, delicious food, and amazing customer service.  You won't be disappointed. They will be my top choice for future catered events!<//Review>< pics>

The honey bear pizza is probably the best pizza I've had in the valley.  Perfect blend of sweet and savory flavors.  Soft, fresh crust - not too doughy or sour.  Good draft selection and the fire pit on the patio is great for cold nights.</Review>

Made a reservation online for a party of 8 and came here for my birthday celebration. The restaurant was surprisingly crowded but we were seated very promptly once our party arrived. Service was pretty good although the bar was backed up for a bit and our drinks took some time to arrive.< /text>

Great food, love the Caesar Salad and their Pepperoni pizza. Cannolis are delicious as well. Everything is a bit expensive, but hey you get what you pay for. Best pizza hands down. Will come back again,Rocco's Neighborhood Pizza  has never let me down.< /text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>This was my first time to Rocco's neighborhood pizza. The pizza was cooked very well (no soggy center, no over done crust). The sausage was so juicy and tasteful. I ordered a meatball on the side just to try (love me some meatballs) reminds me of my grandpa's meatballs and sauce. That's amoré!

If you are ever in the area this place is a good pizza place, quick and very nice service.<//text>< date>

This is a great late night pizza place. It's super small but well worth the wait in line. The pepperoni pizza totally hit the spot for me last night and when I'm out in that area again I'll definitely be going back. There is another pizza place a few doors down and Arinells is much better by far!< /Review>

<text>Incredible Italian dishes, risotto was probably one of the best I've had. Service was on point, we had a group of six in my party. Luckily some of my friends got there early, had to wait an hour on a Monday night but nbd. I believe this is the norm for San Rocco's.< /text></record>

<text>Terrific old school pizza place. Highly recommend the pizza. This crust and the sauce is very good. Slice are good size so you may need to fold them in half. Service is very good. Great place to watch a game. Not a chain restaurant and that is a compliment.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

<Review>5 star pizza.  Good crust, fresh ingredients, fast service. That's all I ate here.  Basic dining room.  It's very casual and was relatively clean.  Temper expectations with respect to what the place looks like but come for great food.  Draft beer selection isn't huge but decent local options (805, lagunitas, peroni, etc.).  A couple of TVs with sports on but no sound.  Would definitely go back.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b93927cc7d97:0x7ee08e5634a72a72</gmap_id></record>

Stay away. The chicken was so dry, I was wondering if I was going to pull splinters out of the top of my mouth. The jalapeño’s were pickled from a can, and if they consider this Brooklyn style pizza, they’ve apparently lost the recipe, because it is far from it. Lastly, the price point for this is horrible and a ripoff.< /Text>

Everything on the menu is amazing and delicious - from the salads to the deserts, and especially the pizzas.  I've eaten there about a dozen times and taken out 4 or 5.  The food has always been great.  Eating there is fun and casual with a great local vibe.  I usually have to wait for a table, but hanging out in Glen Park can be fun too.<//Review>

<Text>Great food

Meatballs were delightful and the Italian sausage was insanely good and fresh! I could have eaten a whole tray.

Pie was decent and the garlic toast really good.

Service was a little slow but I loved the time to check out the charm of the dining space.

Check them out!!!!!</Text>< pics>

Best NY pizza in Los Angeles! I'm from (NJ) NY so I know what I'm talking about. All those other places are second rate! Angie the owner is wonderful and always makes sure you feel welcome as does the whole staff! Prices are great too! Don't miss their chicken parm sandwiches or calzones either.<//Review>

Doesn't live up to the google hype at all. I don't get it. Pizza was decent, but you can get better slices or pies anywhere else in CA and it won't cost $25 for a pizza. 3 star review is for the food, not the price. The waiter was really great though.<//review>

<Name>Shane Snoke</Name><Text>This is our go-to, can't fail, make everyone happy pizza place. Great staff and management, great pizza. I assume all the other food is good, too, but we're pretty dedicated to the pizza. Great for take out or eat in, and has a couple tabletop videogame consoles, which any decent pizza place should have. Lots of TVs for watching sports, nice beer selection.<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2b93927cc7d97:0x7ee08e5634a72a72</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The cheese sticks; The eggplant Parmesan; the pasta salad; the pepperoni pizza are ALL delicious. But the mint cookies and creme ice cream and the canola were the best I've ever had. Beautifully designed interior.< /Review>

This is our go-to, can't fail, make everyone happy pizza place. Great staff and management, great pizza. I assume all the other food is good, too, but we're pretty dedicated to the pizza. Great for take out or eat in, and has a couple tabletop videogame consoles, which any decent pizza place should have. Lots of TVs for watching sports, nice beer selection.</Review>

The pesto pizza and Quattro formaggi are by far the best. This pizza is the closest thing to authentic NY pizza that I've had in southern CA. Our server Yuli took good care of our party of 8. Love coming here and it's great for the whole family!</review>

Pizza is amazing pasta is OK ordered a chicken alfredo and was so bland and tasteless and very small portion I paid 18$ for the plate it just was not worth i make a better pasta at home.. it was pretty dissatisfying but  drinks and appetizers are good. I recommend the onion rings highly. Could of been a better experience</review>

One of the best pies I've had in LA!  Friendly and attentive staff, and a good beer selection put them over the top! I only wish they had been around when I lived midtown and was in school downtown 25 years ago, but they've only been in business 18 years. :)< /Review>

Ordered slice of mushroom and sausage. It was huge. And very good.

Soft, high-quality dough. Soft crust. Stringy cheese.

To me, it's a top five pizza joint in Los Angeles.</Text>

This would have been a 3 star review, but thanks to stellar customer service (on behalf of our server, John) I couldn't be quicker to change my mind. This was my uncle and I's first visit here and despite being avid restaurant goers, we don't usually bother leaving reviews.

We ordered a large pizza with several toppings, including bacon. It came out undercooked and rubbery which is a "no-go" for my uncle and I. When we brought it to John's attention, he couldn't be more responsive and accommodating. We suggested maybe that he take the bacon that was on the pizza and cook it longer as a means of being more reasonable, but he insisted they make it right and make a new one. He even insisted we keep the 1st pizza for our inconvenience which, even with no bacon, was DELICIOUS! It wasn't too doughy, the ingredients were fresh and they were very generous with the toppings.

We go out to eat almost all the time and we have experienced so many businesses that never bother to weigh to cost of repeat business vs bottom line. I would be thanking my lucky stars as a business owner in an economic climate like this to have an employee like John on their staff to look out for both the business AND the customers alike.

We will most certainly be eating here again and if you value the things I've written above, you ought to as well.<//Text>

<GmapID>0x80c2b93927cc7d97:0x7ee08e5634a72a72<//GmapID><Review>This place was remembered as THE place for Sicilian style 'zza about 2-3 years ago but it must have gone downhill big time because despite the fact that it was a busy Saturday night the pizza was worse than subpar. I understand that it was busy since it was Sat night but our order was incorrect and the pizza was under-baked and the toppings were skimped on and low grade. To make matters worse, I knew that they only made their Sicilian style in a certain size, a 12 slice rectangle which would have been happily and easily consumed if it were any good. In fact, it tasted worse (no surprise) by the next day, so nothing doing but to dump the remaining five and a half slices in the trash (yes, I somehow managed to choke down half a slice). What a waste. We went out of our way to go there to be disappointed. The only consolation was a two-fer with regard to my rose, but it was a moderate consolation.< /Review>< date>

Nice people, good calzone. Just request to cook pizza a bit longer if you prefer your cheeses and toppings to be crisp.</text>

<text>I work down the street from this place so it has become a frequent lunch spot for me and coworkers.  Not only is this place delicious but they have a great lunch special.  You can either get two slices of pizza, one topping each, and a soda or one slice of pizza, also one topping, with a salad and a drink for $7.  I always go with the latter so I don't feel so bad about my diet, especially when the slices are enormous.

We've never had a problem finding a table here, even when we come with a large party.  The staff is very friendly and don't hesitate to ask for suggestions or for something made especially for you.  If you're in the area and want some pretty good pizza for a cheap price then I recommend checking this place out.  I have yet to have a bad experience here and I always look forward to my next visit.</text>< Pics>

We enjoyed the sandwiches (we had a meatball and a chicken parmesan) but the pizza was just ok, no one really like it but they didn't hate it either. It was just ok (we had cheese, pepperoni, and BBQ chicken). The house salad has a balsamic vinaigrette which I enjoyed but the wife did not. Seemed hit and miss for everyone in our group, so I'd just say it was ok overall.<//Text>< time>

The pizza looks delicious. So I thought it would be yummy on the 4th of July (yeah, I know, hot dogs are the thing but it's a free country and I wanted 🍕, damnit!) Ordered very easily on their website. Got my email confirmation that it would be ready in 30 minutes. Arrived a few minutes early to find...closed for the 4th! Really? It's 2018, you mean to tell me your website can't tell me this?! Needless to say I was highly perturbed but I still plan to celebrate the greatness of our country tonight. Just not the greatness of this joint.</Text>

<gmap_id>0x80c2b93927cc7d97:0x7ee08e5634a72a72< /gmap_id><Review>I usually don't eat as a Italian pizzaish restaurants because of all the carbs. As much as I love pasta and breaded parmesan and breaded eggplant and ziti and calzones I've been cutting back. Well my girlfriend and her kids and my son were all hanging out for a visit and she chose this restaurant right by my hotel  Kimpton Wilshire.
I mean literally you walk downstairs out the door turn right and walk 200 feet and there it is Rocco's. So because of my dilemma not to eat too many carbs we went and I searched the menu to find something. I ordered the meatballs and the Caesar salad. Let me tell you, those meatballs were huge and the sauce was out-of-this-world the meat was moist and juicy and I don't think I've ever had better meatballs in my entire life and I have traveled. It had just the right amount of spiciness to the sauce and everyone at the table agreed even the kids. Zack the waiter was very nice and invited me back to the restaurant tomorrow while I was visiting. I do believe I'm going back to try the grilled onions and peppers and sausage I can't wait.<//Review>< UserId.>

I used to order two or three times a week for lunch-time delivery but no more.  They have now instituted a $2.95 delivery charge, WTH!  Really?  $3 on top of the $10 sandwich – totally NOT WORTH IT!<//text>

I wanted to plan a birthday escape and this experience went beyond what I was hoping for. My group was accommodated and even though a member of the party was delayed, they were able to hold the room for us. We had a fun time and all staff went above and beyond to make this day special.< /text>

Our family had crazy amounts of fun finding our way out of the Prison Escape Room! We can't wait to try the other room and also in January we hear there will be another room to try. Thanks Joe for your hospitality and  assistance!< /Text>

< Review>
I love this place! I have played in two of their rooms: Prison Break and The Gentleman's Den, and I could not have asked for a better experience. The rooms are super well thought out and tricky enough to keep you and your friends entertained for the whole experience, I cant wait to go back!</Review>

<text>This was so much fun!  We were celebrating a birthday and had no idea what we were doing, they let us bring in our alcohol, our guide was so cool, put up with our ridiculousness and played along and joked with us which made it so much more fun!
Would recommend everyone try this!<//text>< Rating>

I had no idea what to expect when I purchased our tickets. I was kinda skeptical because amusement in Redding is generally a let down. Escape Redding took fun to a whole new level!!! Not only was it a blast and very well organized but the staff was excellent an very personable. Thank you Escape Redding for the most fun I've had in a long time!!!</review>

Amazing! If you have any sense of adventure, do this. Ashley is super friendly and helpful and it's totally reasonably priced for what you get. The rooms are so fun and great for group events. Challenging but doesn't leave you feeling like an idiot.</text>

We played Escape Redding’s “Knight” room last night and had a good time. There were 6 of us. 2 newbies and 4 of us who have played Escape games at the other Redding Escape Room locations as well as in other cities. The room was done very well. The setting was awesome and all of the props were very cool. I can definitely appreciate the attention to detail that went into creating the experience. The staff member that helped us along our journey was very pleasant.

During our time in the room... 2 of the required props broke. Both were needed to uncover clues to move forward. The staff member had never encountered the issue and was unsure of what to do. It was a little disappointing for us and negatively impacted our experience and forced us to rush at the end to complete the objective.

I would rate my experience as a 3 Star. However, I am happy and supportive of this new local business and hope to see them thrive which is why I am giving it a 4 star rating. The issues that we encountered were unforeseen and couldn’t have been reasonably expected but certainly should have been handled differently.< /Review>

Five of us played the Prison Break room and it was a blast! I loved the attention to detail and the ways they made the puzzles. The game host was so personable and enthusiastic about what he did. Loved that the vision of the business is to get people to connect in person instead of just through phones and social media.

The only thing that was weird for us is that the parking lot was not well lit so we had a little trouble finding it as well as it felt a little creepy. Be nice to see a better lit parking lot and maybe a neon sign to see that they're open.<//text>

We have done two rooms with different groups, one mostly adults and their mostly 12 year olds (we were required to provide an adult with them). The puzzles are challenging but the staff provides clues if needed at optimal times. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the two experiences were quite different. They offer a discount on your second visit. We looked into their competitors but were turned off by staff so chose Escape Redding. I highly recommend Escape Redding!<//review>

<review>Incredibly fun and addictive!!

I completed the Knight room along with 7 friends and we had a phenomenal time! The clues and puzzles were so entertaining and challenging. We we're able to solve it and came out of the room pumped up and ready to solve crimes

Two days later I went with 3 other friends and completed the Gentlemen's room. This room was spectacular with many surprises! I was amazed at the thought and work that went into building this room to make it exciting and heart racing.

I am so impressed with the escape rooms here that I'm returning very soon to complete the Prison Break room.

Also its important to note that the location is super convenient on hilltop and there is a great wine tasting room next door called Moseley's.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Fun but needs a bit more structure.  It should be set up where you can't get clues that are ahead of other clues.  It should go in sequence.<//Text>

Oh, Escape Redding is absolutely FANTASTIC and a total must for anyone who loves escape rooms, and/or riddle games!

While I live in the Bay Area now, I grew up in Redding, and never would have imagined that escape rooms would make it this far up North, nor would I have imagined they would be as well thought out as Escape Redding.

A group of nine of us tried our luck with the "Knight Room" and had an incredible time! IT IS SO COOL. The attention to detail in this room is mind boggling - every clue and every riddle is intricately placed. It was challenging enough but not to the point that you were completely frustrated.

Another major plus is how kind the owners are. You can tell they put their heart into this business and thus charge a totally reasonable $25/person. We'll definitely be coming back to try the other rooms next time we're home!< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I will be as honest as possible. I mainly want this review to be seen as a suggestion versus a bad review. We actually had a good time and the staff was friendly. This was the knight.

1. The room where everything is explained before entering the actual room needs to be changed. When I entered this brightly lit room, it took away the suspenseful atmosphere. A bright room just seems like a super happy vibe.
2. In this same room, they used a PowerPoint presentation to explain everything. It kinda felt like being in school, so that too kinda took away the suspenseful vibe. The past host's we've had at different locations were VERY in character and had the script memorized so it felt like we were in an actor's presence. They knew how to set the tone. He was a great guy and all but again, it didn't capture the suspense.
3. There was no background music to help set the tone. No feeling of suspense or the feeling of running out of time. I want my heart racing and i want to be stressing out, lol
4. Another host popped in and out a couple times to help out but it ruined the atmosphere more than anything. When you're at the theater getting lost in the plot, you don't want someone to keep popping in and out, am I right?
5. Some issues with the props. The door was solved by my step dad just by tinkering around with it and not using the clues. That shouldn't be possible. There was a unlocked pad lock that wasn't fastened shut. Host's should double check things like that. There was a missing magnet to complete a task.
6. The tv monitor in the escape room should make like a small beep noise to notify about new information updated on the screen. We get lost in the moment and we don't even think about looking up at the screen.
7. We felt like too many hints had to be given out. The game should make connections quite smoothly. We shouldn't have to depend on the screen. We want to feel that self accomplishment.

We did have fun and I'm open to try another room. I'm not the type to ask for a refund but it would be nice to have a freebie invitation to make up for all the inconveniences that happened that day. Thanks again and I hope this review was helpful.< /Review>< pics>

I made my appointment to get the vaccine today at 10 am. I showed up sign my name and after 1 hour and 10 minutes waiting some one comes out to let me know that they don't have the vaccine that they Run out. ( WHY THEY DIDN'T TELL ME WHEN I GOT THERE AND NOT MAKE ME WEIST MY TIME ) I also lost my day of work.
Looks like they need to have better control of the vaccine and appointments and not run the clinic like chickens with no heads.<//review>

Worst Experience Ever! The Medical Assistants are slow and are so rude and always have an ugly attitude. If they don’t like their job and the do something different. Even with an appointment they take forever! Appointment or not it’s still slow. The MA’s don’t know what they are talking about and doing horrible place. But the doctors amazing unfortunately they don’t see it’s the MA who are ruining this place. Smh.<//Text>

Had an appointment at 4:30 on a Saturday, they are supposed to be open until 5pm. Once I got there, the entire office was closed. Why accept appointments when you’re clearly intent on closing your office? Even their sister locations couldn’t explain to me where the staff could possibly be. Very unprofessional, obviously won’t be returning.< /review>

Been coming to this clinic for quite sometime now, and overall I can honestly say that I am satisfied with the professional services I receive, at no cost. Front desk, doctor of the day, and pharmacy is exceptional. Thank you!</text>

The people at the front desk have no education in customer service, they shouldn't be at the front desk, they make people run away, I've been coming here and it's always the same, this is my last time. My first words good morning they don't care, they don't even have a nice answer to that, you come here you'll regret it, doctors are the same, very bad attitude from everyone here! Poor people that's not smart from them...</text>

<Review>everything about this place is horrible.. LONGEST WAIT EVER.!!!! My Apt was at 9:45 and was seen until 11:20.. ALMOST 2 freakin hours of siting in the waiting room.. but that’s not it... when I saw the doctor she just spoke to me for  like 3 mins and I was good to go... I was in for a Monthly prenatal visit.. and I didn’t even get an Ultrasound.. WAISTED MY TIME. Worse Service. Longest Wait. HORRIBLE!!! Do NOT COME HERE.

I gave one star because dr.rostami is so rude and mean. I had been coming here for the last few weeks and he has the same bad attitude every single time. He spoke to my mom and I so badly. All the times i’ve been attended by him, he only examines you for less than 5 minutes amd gives some random medication. The nurses and front desk are nice. But the other doctors are almost the same. They just look at you for 5 minutes and done. If you can go to a different doctor, then go. These doctors are no help whatsoever and will make you feel stupid.<//Text>

Horrible place save your self some time and go somewhere else according to the front desk girl and I say this because I never spoke to the doctor for the OB on the second floor the doctor would not see me and give me my results because I refused to get glucose test I explained that I just wanted my results due to the covi19 I did not want to be in the clinic long and they repeatedly refused to let me see the doctor for results only to the point of saying that if I wanted a copy of results it would be $30 something anyways they are money oriented they DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PATIENT!< /Text>

This place is the worse I would suggest you transfer to another clinic. Every paper I need ends up getting lost and when it’s time for a check up it takes up to 5 hours of sitting there only to find out they can’t find your chart.</review>

<review>Its ok didn't take too long .. They have free transportation ... I gave them a 3 stars because the janitor is rude .. He is sweeping the floor going between peoples legs to get under the chair .. I saw him sweep a woman's feet .. But the crazy thing about it is people are accepting it ... The pharmacist to the connecting pharmacy is prejudice .. I am a black female .. He was looking at me talking and kept turning around like he didn't see me than when he did talk to me before I could even get my sentence out he was already ready to say he can't help me .. Other than that the medical staff was cool .. Better than what you would expect from a county funded M.D. ... Now I was going to suggest the transportation even though he was 1 hr late conning to my house ... But when he said 45 mind to wait for a ride home and it turned into 2hrs and 21 mins aww he'll naw..I bet ill drive next time trying to save gas .. The driver is constantly on peoples bumper from looking at his maps .. And cursing and honking the horn with road rage Idk maybe he has diffrent driving etiquette.</review><time>1498863393078<//time><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I never seen a clinic so inefficient.  They took over a week to look for my medical records and in the end I just brought my own because they couldnt find them. Im 32 weeks pregnant and the only reason I need them is because theyre the only clinic that will have me deliver near my home (presbyterian hospital). The staff is completely rude to me, all but 1 woman there has an attitude and the doctor is hardly there. They give me problems every time I have to make an appointment which is unacceptable and very stressful for someone as pregnant as me. St Judas needs to get it together, they have no idea what theyre doing and they really need to learn customer service as well. They're a terrible prenatal clinic. I do not recommend them.<//Text>< Pictures>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>(1st floor -childrens area for immunizations ) This is 3rd time coming here this week and i tried to dismiss my mother's opinion about the unprofessionalism and bad customer service by staying and giving them a chance. But mothers are always right. After this i will NOT be coming back. I was not told i needed to bring back my children's immunization records for the TB test to be read, i live all the way in Hawthorne,  so i definitely would have brought it  to Wilshire had i known. The tone that the ladies speak to me at the front desk would have made me check her with the same attitude i was given, however, i didnt want to cause a seen without being SEEN by the nurse/dr, (not worth it considering i need my kids tb read) but these small clinics need to have a class in customer service. I will not return here once my childrens tb test is read.<//Text>< UserId.>

Please DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. The staff was friendly  but the Doctor is unprofessional, rude and the consultation was about 1 min. long

(Translated by Google) For a fool I chose that clinic, 🙄 firstly the rooms are very small, they only fit 2 people, and in the second place, they don't even have advanced family planning, which in front of the logo they say that they make you even vasectomy, and it's a lie .. because they only know how to prescribe pills, and injections, for control they don't even put the IUD, I don't understand how it is that it is always so full if they don't have anything advanced there, it seems that everything is old-fashioned.

(Original)
Por tonta elegi esa clinica,🙄en primer lugar los cuartos son muy pequeños solo caben 2 personas, y en 2do, ni siquiera tienen planificación familiar avanzada, cosa que enfrente en el logo dicen que te hacen hasta la vasectomya, y es mentira.. porque solo saben recetar pastillas, y inyecciones, para el control ni siquiera ponen ni el DIU, no entiendo como es que siempre está tan lleno si no tienen nada avanzado ahí, Parece que todo está a la antigua.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) They do not deserve a single star, the truth is that the service is disastrous for calling it somehow, you arrive at the lobby and the first thing you see is people who seem to not be paid to do their work, you arrive by appointment or without an appointment and the The treatment is the same, it takes millions of years to attend to you even for a simple blood test, really, here even the most patient loses patience, "literal"

No se merecen ni una sola estrella, la verdad que el servicio es nefasto por llamarlo de alguna manera, llegas al lobby y lo primero que ves es personas que pareceriera que no les pagan por hacer su trabajo, llegas con cita o sin cita y el trato es el mismo se tardan millones de años en atenderte hasta para un simple examen  de sangre, de verdad que aquí hasta el más paciente pierde la paciencia, "liteal"</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Waiting time 2 to 3 hours. Sometimes there is gynecolo sometimes not. They made me wait so long to say there would be no doctor. Another day they passed me after an hour to the room to wait for the doctor at the time they called me on the phone to ask if I had gone to my house. They forgot that I was in the room.
Another day I was not a doctor but a midwife. Every day is different doctor. Again I had some tests and forgot to send the tests to the laboratory. And with the children they don't even want to touch the doctors just by seeing them they tell you they have. For me very bad service.

(Original)
Tiempo de espera 2 a 3 horas. A veces hay ginecolo a veces no. Me hicieron esperar tanto para decir que no habría doctor. Otro día me pasaron después de una hora al cuarto a esperar el doctor a la hora me llamaron por teléfono para preguntar si me había ido a mi casa . Se olvidaron que estaba en el cuarto.
Otro día no era doctor sino una partera. Cada día es diferente doctor. Otra vez me hicieron unos exámenes y se les olvidó mandar las pruebas al laboratorio. Y con los niños ya ni los quieren tocar los doctores solo con verlos te dicen que tienen. Para mí muy mal servicio.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Pity service by phone and in person, they make you bad faces, take too long. They have no organization.
I do not recommend it at all.

This is our 2nd time coming to this shop since we found out about it. This shop is very nice, clean, modern and most importantly professional. Everyone does an amazing job. I definitely would recommend everyone to give this shop a try if you haven't yet. You will not be disappointed.< /text>

I travel all over the country and enjoy checking out local barbershops. This is one of the best barbershops I've ever been to. Customer service is great, plenty of seating and more importantly skilled barbers. Thank you guys!<//Review>

Made two trips in one day with different foster children. They both liked their haircuts. A little more expensive then similar type barbershops. Did not have to wait long.< /Review>

Most of the negative comments are on point .. been here twice ... both haircut were weak ... all the good barbers here only do appointments.  Walk ins are treated like trash .. and best believe theyll get their homies b4 you< /review>

<review>Came in today waited about an hour didnt have an appointment which makes sense since its Saturday. Place needs barbers who can work on walk ins or u will be waiting hours until one of them is free. No point coming without an appointment as u will still be charged $25 even without an appointment. Will continue to come but place needs work.</review>< GmapID>

All of our barbers are very detailed and that is why we might take a bit longer to perfect each haircut. I recommend making an appointment next time and we will take care of you here at The Fade Cave'}</response>< review>
Waited hours with no service, let others with no appointment cut. Haircuts given were slow, one guy with little hair was in a chair for 40 mins plus. DO NOT GO HERE!!!< /review>

I felt so blessed when I found Christ Lutheran Church in 2018.  I started attending Christ Lutheran during a very challenging time in my life, and I was brought back to life through the love that was shown to me through friends that I made there.  The people at this church sure do know how to spread and share the love of Christ and BE the hands and feet of Jesus!  It is now almost 3 years later, and I am at home at this church now...now they are my family, my brothers and sisters in Christ and I'm so very grateful that God led me to this place!<//Review>

< Review>
Christ Lutheran Church is a very warm and welcoming place. The staff is extremely encouraging no matter where you are at with your faith. Christ Lutheran Church is also very active in the community. Their generosity helps local foster youth, the homeless, and many others. They also have a strong youth and young adult program. I would recommend this church to anyone who is looking for a compassionate, truth seeking, and philanthropic place to worship. We love CLC.<//Review>

< Review>
Christ Lutheran Church demonstrates that they really care about the community they serve. Since 2017, CLC has donated office space on their campus to Fostering Youth Independence (FYI), a local nonprofit that serves youth who are aging out of the foster care system. The church has generously offered free use of their campus for many FYI events over the years. Currently, the church is allowing us to use their Fellowship Center 3 times a week to offer distance learning support for the youth. Many of the church members are working one-on-one with the foster youth as volunteers. I know that the church actively supports many other local nonprofits as well. Christ Lutheran Church is changing lives, and FYI is grateful for CLC’s encouragement and support!</Review>

This is not true of all churches, as not all theologies are as generous as Lutheran theology.  God is generous with his love to all people; CLC exhibits that love on a regular basis.

<review>Christ Lutheran Church is truly a gem in Santa Clarita.  I have been attending this church from high school into adulthood.  They have a strong community feel.  Offer bible studies for all ages and levels of bible knowledge.  They believe not only in benevolence to local causes but international and national causes as well.  Each of the three Sunday services have their own feel.  8:00 is traditional worship, 9:30 is blended and 11:00 has contemporary music.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Come visit us.  You will find a welcoming, caring congregation and staff.  Great Bible-based sermons.  Community outreach. Prayer support.  Bible Studies every day.  Truly a church who follows the Word of Jesus and where you will find family.<//review>< rate>

<Review>I showed up here with my family 25 years ago, looking for God, with no real church background and not knowing what to expect. What a remarkable journey it has been. The opportunities to better know the Lord, to be involved, to serve, to dig deeper, to build friendships, and to lead have been endless. After 25 years I am still continuing to learn and grow in my relationship with Christ. Christ Lutheran Church has been such a great blessing to me and my family. Now, I find great joy in seeing new generations of young families arriving here and beginning their own faith journeys. No matter where you are in life, or in your walk with God, there is a place for you at Christ Lutheran Church.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>Our experience at Christ Lutheran Church began over 20 years ago with the preschool. We never knew then how Jesus Christ would come into our lives and through us into our community. Our family has been able to share the love of Jesus Christ in many Santa Clarita and Los Angeles area Christ Lutheran Church service projects. We have built homes in Mexico and Guatemala. Christ Lutheran Church installed solar panels for a remote hospital we had visited in the Central African Republic. We have even been able to spread the love of Jesus Christ in Egypt. Looking back, I never would have thought this journey was possible!< /Text><response>None<//response><user_name>Kevin Frandson<//user_name>< Pictures>

CLC is my church home! The people are my family. We enjoy worshiping together on Sundays. We share an amazing week of VBS together for a full week of praising God in the summer. Buts it’s much more that that. My children have created a life changing relationship with Jesus because of the wonderful Sunday school, youth adventures, confirmation and high school Impact! If your looking for a church then come join us either on Sundays or on Wednesday. I’ll be serving dinner at the Kitchen from 5-7 pm.</Text>

This church is amazing! The staff is warm and friendly, the children's programs are fun and engaging, and the adult offerings are phenomenal. They really care about people, and especially growing together as a family.<//review>

Christ Lutheran Church has outstanding Children and Youth Ministry starting in the Nursery all the way through High School.  Their Summer VBS program is the best in the SCV!  And they are committed to doing the work of God both in our Community and in the Middle East.  (Teams have gone to Morocco, Egypt and Lebanon are planning to send two teams to the Middle East in 2019.  I am grateful for this place and the people here who love Jesus and each other!</text>

We love this church, it is incredibly supportive and feels like a true family. Most of the negative reviews here are from people that have never even attended.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Christ Lutheran Church is a wonderful place to worship. We searched for quite a while and while many places in the SCV are great, there is something very unique, special about CLC. To be honest, you have to visit CLC a few times to see if you experience the same feeling we got, and I highly recommend attending not just a random service, but also their events. The sense of family and community we feel at CLC is overwhelmingly positive. It's refreshing to be around people that care for people, for children, for community. I hope you give CLC a chance and just perhaps you and your family will feel it too. Either way, I certainly hope you find a place that's a special to you and your loved ones as CLC is to us.</Review>< pics>

Beef dip sandwiches are my FAVORITE this is ONLY the second place that has made the most AMAZING beef dip. I will DEFINITELY try some of their other sandwiches.  The bread is nice and soft and not too much so you don't  just taste the bread. The flavor is absolutely wonderful.  The couple that runs it is super nice, polite and helpful. The price is reasonable as well. I plan to return many more times.</text>

I've been coming here for years. I used to live in Glendora. Once you try the sandwiches here...you won't want to go to Subway. They keep it simple. I love this place. My favorite sandwhich? #16....with bacon 🥓.  😀<//review>

These amazing small business owners are doing a service to the public. They are selling giant overstuffed sandwiches for cheaper than subway. The quality of meat, cheese, and produce is phenomenal, and if you order any club sandwich they put about a pound of bacon on there.<//text>

I have seen this place for years and bypassed it for one reason or another. Don't make that mistake. The sandwiches are fresh, made to order and pick up is a breeze. The prices are great and the service is top notch. A hidden gem. Don't be fooled by its looks. The owner is quite the artist too and has paintings throughout.<//text>

One of the strangest restaurants you'll ever enter with one of the best subs you'll ever get under under 10 bucks. I stand perplexed but also incredibly pleased.

Keep doing what you are doing over there Tj.</text>

Slightly bigger crowd than there used to be, but you still get your food promptly. Best hole in the wall, easy to miss sandwich place you'll ever eat at. And they're like 5 bucks. So much better than all these chains like jersey mikes, and literally less than half the price.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Great sandwich spot. I prefer it over capri deli and sandwich city. Great price for the size of the sandwich.  Try the bonanza with bacon!</review>

<Review>The owner and his wife are asian. Their is a little tiny language barrier when you order food in english but it isnt that bad. The owner is really nice. The only thing you have to answer to is combo no combo, everything, and do you want small or large? Personally i think most of the ingrediants are typical over the counter hams and turkeys but the beauty of this place lies in his quality of bread, the size, and all the stuff he jams into the bread. I always order the turkey bacon and cheese. For only $8 this sub is already bursting at the seam but he really loads up on the bacon to top it off. I always question how he makes a profit since bacon is pretty pricey. If you love bread, this is the place for you. The bread is never, and i mean never... stale. you can easily just have half of the sub and eat the other half for dinner. i have been a customer of pj's for about 8 years.< /Review>< Name>

Love the amount of Bacon they use, but unfortunitly the bacon tasted sort of old, or cooked in a old dirty cast iron pan.<//Review>

< Review>
The facility is clean and the owner was very informative and helpful. The Bluetooth stereo system was also an awesome addition.There are however, 2 main drawbacks with this facility.

1. The photos on Google are VERY deceiving. The court is NOT made out of hardwood floors, but instead multiple small tiles that had little air pockets in them. This set-up removed a lot of the bounce from our basketballs and it made dribbling more difficult.

2. The indoor court is incredibly small and the electric box units made it very dangerous for my party to play all out, competitive 5 on 5 basketball. There was even one instance where my friend actually rolled his ankle because of this layout.

Overall the experience was fun, but I probably would not do it again because of the 2 issues listed above. I think the court needs to be renovated/expanded for me to consider this place again-especially for the $50/hour asking price.</Review>

<text>It's an interesting place in Carson with a parquet floor. We appreciated their availability.  Although it's not air conditioned so it can get hot or cold. It seems like a popular place.<//text>< pics>

I go here because of my grandcildren. Great place, up todate equipment, six baskets, clean, removeable aluminum bleachers plus folding chairs, private. Oh, two gyms, but I have not seen the second one.  Have not seen the restrooms. I would assume the gym an restroom are as clean as the first gym.< /Text>

Kind of hard to find in the middle of nowhere but solid gym. There's actually 2 basketball courts so plenty of ppl could pack in.</Text>

Not very helpful unlike the last location.  If you put the two local hardware stores together you might have one good one here.< /Text>

Helfull hardware man! Nonsense, they are Not Helpful, sure they can guide you to your purchase! But try to get them to help you find color stain match....Forget it! They don't even let you open the can to try it on the wood sample you need to find a match for! Plus they hire rude workers who barge past you in the isles!
Piersons in Eureka is also an Ace hardware.... Employees at PIERSONS are soooo helpful, I wish McKinleyville Ace could be like them!<//Text>

I brought in a gallon of paint that the McKinleyville Ace had made for me 2 months ago. I needed three more of the same color. Since their colorants have changed, they told me they were unable to guarantee an exact match, but also if I allowed them to attempt it I would have to pay for the gallon whether or not it matched. Took them almost an hour to tell me this. This is completely ridiculous. Please hire some competent employees and teach them how to properly match paint. I have purchased a lot of paint from them, and I will have to buy my paint elsewhere.< /text>

I've never had a bad experience. Employees I dealt with seem to know there stuff. Only complaint is that I live across the street and traffic has pickup quite a bit, I would expect that, they are a great hardware store.</text>

Management is really bad. Bought a quart of paint and talked with Linda (the HR person) after I was unhappy with the color. She didn’t seen coherent and was unable to help due to something mentally going on with her. This was before Covid so I don’t know what gives. I’d pass on this place until new management< /review>

The staff at Ace are incredibly helpful and friendly.  I teach in McKinleyville and about a year ago was working on a garden project with my kiddos.  I went to Ace to get gloves for the class and asked if the business would be able to help with the cost of the gloves as a charitable donation to the local school.  An employee stepped up (I believe his name was Matthew) and voluntarily purchased the entire set of gloves!  It was nice to see that the store’s employees really cared about helping the community hey serve.  I go there regularly and am never disappointed.<//Text>

<text>The staff here are always helpful. My only concern is the signs I’ve seen through town saying to ban mckinleyville ace. I don’t know what the deal is with the signs, but I’d be giving Ace 5 stars if it weren’t for the signs. Just noticed the box trailer parked next to ace the other day driving by that had the sign on it. I’d thought it had gotten taken down when I stopped seeing the truck parked by the Highschool on Murray</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place is Horrible!! The owner not only violently (death) threatened the neighbors in the area but also he destroyed land on neighboring properties and refuses to fix it or take responsibility. He is truly an angry psychopath filling the community with fear and it baffles me that ace will allow such horrible management to run this place.</Text><Date>1560465674404</Date>< Rating>

Customer service is really good and that makes a difference. We buy a lot of supplies here for a small hotel we run so I'm in there  a lot. Marisa, a clerk was one helpful employee although there a few others but I don't recall their names.< /Text>

This store has really changed, it is nothing like it was a few years ago. There are only a few of the original employees left at this store that I feel comfortable around and that seem really knowledgeable about products. Also, they no longer have a lumber department like they had in their previous location.</review>

I have spent a ton of money over the last 15 years, and will NEVER again go there. I tried to return an item I bought in December, in the Christmas section, next to all the other Christmas lights. They refused and said it was a Halloween item. The lights never said anything about Halloween, and were identical to the same ones for Christmas. After standing in a long line, and told they wouldn't take it back, a floor manager (Ryan) rudely said they wouldn't return it. It was still in the unopened box and only purchased a week earlier. I told him that I own a retail business in town, and would never let a customer leave upset over such a small issue. I said it was a poor managerial decision. He then told me to leave. I never raised my voice, used foul language, or said his name. I cannot for the life of me understand why they would throw away a long time customer over such an little issue. All I wanted was an exchange or refund on an unused item. This would have cost them nothing, but instead Ryan caused the business to loose dozens of future sales, hundreds of future dollars, and leave a customer telling everybody about the horrible service he received at ACE Mckinleyville. That was truly a HORRIBLE managerial decision.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Richard helped me with a carpet cleaner rental. Excellent service etiquette. He explained everything about the machine and how to use it. I had no issues with it.

Upon returning the equipment, I spoke to a gentleman who answered my questions about gun permits and the process of acquiring the paperwork. All while training a fellow employee. My apologies to him because I can't remember his name. I do feel bad about not remembering his name, because he was great at giving me the answers I needed.</review>

<text>I just wanted to leave a quick note regarding my experiences at Ace Hardware in McKinleyville, CA.

I am Wild for the Floral department. These people bend over backwards to help you and always send out Beautiful arraignments.  I have also called at 12:40 and they took my order and would have it delivered before 5:00. WOW you don't find that service anymore in our Country.

I will not go anywhere else. Believe me, I Love to call and then relax knowing that my arraignment will make it there on time and look absolutely Beautiful.....

< review>
This is a decent hardware store mostly knowledgeable staff. I was needing a 1/2 inch cap and one younger guy tried to sell me a 6.50$ brass cap and did not offer me the 1.75 $ galvanized cap like they did in eureka in Henderson center. They sell reflectix but not reflectix tape and everyone is not sure what you would   use it for when you ask for the tape. They don't tint oil based paint but Thomas's does. Ace hardware mckMcKinleyvi is much better than Thomas's homecenhome but Thomas's Simpsons ties are 30% cheaper idk why probably forgot to change price from the year 1999 till now. I like their nice cooking area at Ace hardware but,18.99$ for a canopener! I got one for 1.99$ at Walmart that works great I'm no it a Walmart fan but when there is a place difrediffe like that I can't afford the 18.99$ canopener.< /review>

<review>I can no longer shop here since they moved to the new building. They crammed all their items too close together, the aisles are so close together I cannot walk down them, let alone use my power wheelchair. It WILL NOT. fit. So now I have to order as all my hardware items online.</review><GmapID>0x54d15aec28493869:0x67e4c7c4a0910adb<//GmapID><Name>Zarmo P.

Typically they answer questions and then read the product label, reversing what they initially said.
The paint manager sold me 5 gal of deck stain, after applying it I found out it was siding stain, not deck stain.
THEY SOLD ME THE WRONG PRODUCT AND WOULDN'T STAND BEHIND THEIR MISTAKE.
Eventually the fellow that sold me the siding stain confessed to making a mistake.

There is a huge turnover of employees. From month to month most of the staff changes. This tells me that most of their staff is inexperienced and discontented.< /Text>

I was told I should have called and gave them a chance to fix or replace machine. This was a 24 hour rental. I told the guy I  have rented machine before and it did the same thing and they didnt charge me. I was told since I didnt call it was my fault and was charged full price no anything and was told if i didnt like that i could talk to owner not very nice ACE wont go back again ever<//text>< pics>

As with other reviews appears NO ONE knows or cares about the customers.  Put on hold for over 10 minutes and still no one seemed to know for sure if they had this item!!!!!  Will not waste time or money driving down to see.< /Text>

< review>
Most of the employees hardly know anything about the products in the store.  The owner is a total jerk and the prices are high.  It looks like they are hiring for all positions because no one wants to work there.</review>

I used to go to the old location a lot more often.  Not sure why I don't like the new store as much.  Odd layout maybe?  Maybe because it aspires to be a home depot but fails?  I'm confused by it so I don't go.< /Review>

Great for picking up supplies quickly. Our Petco in Emeryville closed, and this place is smaller but faster. Also, there is no live animals here unlike original Petco stores, so it does not stink. Basically a cleaner and quicker way of shopping supplies from Petco.< /review>

Great friendly boutique pet store without the boutique prices. You can find the healthiest tastiest treats n dog food here. My dogs coats and skin are amazing. They are 12 and everyone comments "what cute puppies". staff is always friendly kind n knowledgable.I buy the Merrick but all thee brands seem elevated from your standard.<//review>

Staff is always helpful, available to offer advice on cat food, etc. The store is always clean and well stocked. Staff is also friendly and attentive. I will continue to shop at Unleashed for my two black cats.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>This place is great! Super friendly, knowledgeable staff who have been super kind and generous with their time and attention to my frightened rescue dog. I love that I can try things to find out what he likes, and bring it back if he doesn't. VERY helpful, since I bought the wrong sizes of many things, and he's picky about treats.</text>< Pictures>

Horrible water pressure to wash my corgi. Not enough shampoo for her coat either. Blow dryers shorted out, although they fixed it pretty far once they noticed us standing there in the back.</review>

I saw less then what the Original Petco store carryed: the quality of food-100% natural eatables was absent, toys to phoney in nature, the lighting was dark (alarming); self cleaning basin-oversized udoodle in it. Nothing was usable or workable. Sorry, if i wrong but it had a boring mood and the employees looked at you as you were a suspect.  Where is the love?</Review>

<review>I had a horrendous return incident of a bed I ordered on the Petco site, which the Petco store was unable to help me with for whatever reason. So instead I went over to Unleashed, where Andrea helped me for at LEAST an hour, trying to figure out how to return it and what the issue was. She sat on the phone for over 20 minutes trying to get a hold of costumer service for me, and, since it was taking so long, let me leave my name and number so she could contact me once she got a hold of them. She was so nice, patient, and so so helpful and supportive. I’ve never had quite the same experience anywhere else, and Unleashed is the only pet store I want to shop at now.<//review>< rate>

<Text>Good place to get a dog wash. I'm not so sure about buying stuff there, though.  The prices seem high, but, then again, they're high at most other brick and mortar pet stores, too.  Staff are very friendly, though I did run into an issue once where the store was closed at a time when it wasn't supposed to be (short staffed)</Text><GmapID>0x808f80c49109837d:0xd2678473aa08169<//GmapID><Time>1530400885883</Time>< rate>

Good size pet supply store in a shopping center.
Staff seem both helpful and knowledgeable.
Prices are fair.. Not excessive nor bargaon priced.
Their selection of pet foods and pet toys is extensive, especially in regards to dogs and csts.</Review>

This was the best experience I've ever had at a pet supply store. I just adopted my dog about a week ago and she isn't loving the food I already got for her, so i came in to get some wet food to make it more enticing. Asia greeted me immediately and asked me if i needed help, so i told her what i was looking for, she asked what kind of dog i had, mentioned pitties are picky eaters, gassy, sensitive, and often have skin issues, which was everything i was dealing with! She gave me a handful of excellent recommendations, showed me their raw food options, wet food for sensitive tummies, all food had minimal ingredients, no BS fillers, chemicals, dyes, or preservatives, and all for a fair price. Her knowledge was extensive and so helpful. She got me signed up with them so i could utilize all their coupons and best deals. I will be returning to this store, and this store only. Thank you Asia!</Review>

Good place to get toys and food but not to wash your dog. You have to pick your dog up like 3 feet and put him in a sink and try to wash your dog in this small place.</text>

Small pet shop that feels better quality. It's nicer than petco but has a very select group of items. Items include dog, cat, and select bird items but not much else. I would shop here if I really needed but most items are cheaper at target.< /text>

<text>Overall, two thumbs and four paws up!

If you like Pet Food Express, or any other store that feels a lot less like a typical Petco/Petsmart-style huge commercial venture, with gigantic stores and staff that knows very little about what they do, then Unleashed by Petco is for you.

Their product selection is a little less comprehensive than a full-blown Petco, and I think Pet Food Express is far better at stocking well-priced, well-thought-out, and great quality apparel-type items (I always get compliments on my dog's raincoat, which is easily the best thing I never even thought existed, before I saw it at PFE, and even has a functional hood).

That being said, these little stores always seem very thoughtfully stocked, and it's hard to leave this one without a couple large armloads of good quality food (especially if you like the high-quality, grain-free, and high-protein varieties), and necessities that larger stores or other small stores simply don't stock.

This particular store is staffed by really friendly people, and if you own a medium or large dog, you can expect to actually find things here for them, like the dreaded doggie diapers you need to assist your older friend, a large variety of high-quality treats, especially long-lasting and/or puzzle types, and a great selection of hygiene products for fur, skin, teeth, and first aid.  They also carry a basic, but well-chosen and comprehensive range of supplements.  Last but hardly least, this tiny location has a tag engraver, and, of course, the tags to go with it.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I celebrated my nomination earlier this evening in this great place. I am glad to say that we enjoyed a pleasant evening and the restaurant was absolutely one of the reasons for the happy gathering. The stuff  collaborated in a very nice style, the meals were very good and my buddies were so  joyful. We shall surely come back again for more events. Thank you very much.<//review>

<Text>Ehh. Just okay. I ate about half of my wet veggie burrito before I realize there was meat in the green sauce. Not a lot of vegetarian options. It was also cold before I started eating. Music was loud which made it hard to communicate when ordering.
Nice amount of guacamole< /Text>< Response>

The cook doesn't wear a mask! The lady who serves, has alot of attitude. They ignored the phone and were upset when they had to answer! Not worth the time, or lack of safety.< /review>

If you crave a MAN sized burrito that will be habit forming, visit Garcia's Taqueria in Sunnyvale ( Almost across the El Camino from In and Out ). FYI, Garcia's served EXCELLENT food before AND right after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 ( They have backup electrical power ).</Review>

The cook wasn’t wearing a mask. I asked the cashier politely to tell the cook to wear a mask. She rolled her eyes and told the cook. He put it on but after came back and gave us a mean glare. The lady also gave us a attitude the rest of the time. They aren’t sanitary and we’re not wiping the tables. Their sighs say “please wear a mask” I expect their staff to do the same.< /Text>

This place seems pretty unassuming if you look at it from the outside. The prices are okay and the portion size of huge for the burritos. honestly I had better burritos. They really need to keep the water fountain filled up, as it was empty throughout my entire meal. 3.5 stars for this place.< /Text>

If your looking for a great taqueria, look no further! Really good burritos here. Honestly, that's the only reason I come here. It'll be a little burrito biased. All other menu items, dont ask me cuz I grab a burrito from here and am good! I heard they opened up another one but as far as I know this is the original. Stick some tortilla chips in your burrito to get a crunch with a bit! However you eat it, it's a great burrito! Whenever am in the neighborhood, it's hard to not drop in.< /Review>

Came in to buy food today Friday 01/10/20..@ 8: 51pm.
The Salsa bar was emty and asked the Cashier after I placed my order that If she could please let have some salsa for my chips...her reply was that I had to wait when ever she wanted to refill the salsa bar....in Opinion she should be working at this Restaurant..very bad Customer service....in order to get some salsa I had to ask one of the cooks and he gladly gave me a couple of salsa containers...</Text>

Went to this place after reading the good reviews...the food is delicious. Ordered 3 different tacos, super nachos & my buddy had the super burrito. We didn’t speak the entire time...too busy eating. Love it, definitely will be back soon.</review>

This is a small restaurant with a good selection of typical Mexican dishes.  The food was generally good,  but one of the dishes we ordered was a bit oily.  Overall the food is spicy which we enjoyed.<//text>

It's a local taqueria with a family vibe. Their vegetarian burrito is cheap and delicious, and they offer free chips and salsa. Would recommend going.<//Text>

<Text>A cozy taqueria with a big TV (for soccer) and proper Spanish speakers. The nachos with al pastor were great (and huge), but my friend thought his burrito was a little oily. The staff are very friendly; I left my purse and they kept it for me until I could pick it up the next day. Overall a really convenient and casual Mexican restaurant.<//Text>< Pictures>

Now I know when I get a carnita burrito I'll get some fat, but this place literally puts big gigantic chunks of it, and I'm a nice guy who tips.  Gianatic chunks of lard is simply inexcusable, just skip this place and go to the ones down the street.< /text>

Came here for the first time on memorial day. Food was slightly above average and was actually pretty good. My dad ordered a shredded chicken burrito and it was too salty. The staff quickly apologized and offered a grilled chicken burrito instead. Remember you're coming here for the food. The environment is chill and laid back but more of an Authentic Mexican restaurant/cantina. Overall I would come back. Hopefully they have tripas next time!</text>

I ordered veggie burrito, it was mostly sour cream inside with rice and very little traces of guacamole/veggies. The size of burrito was good for the price. Probably not a very good destination for veggie burritos.<//review>

< Review>
Great place. Went there on a whim. Good food & good prices. Food came pretty quick & order was correct. Hubby got the super burrito de carnitas. Real juicey meat, not dry and I got the taco plate w/beans & rice. Couple of sodas & we only paid $20.25. Will definitely go back if we're even back in this area. Thought it was real cool that they feed ALL first responders for free. Saw it 1st hand when a couple of EMTs came in & tried to pay for their order and they wouldn't take their money. Kudos to this place. Thanks for taking care of those that take care of all of us on a daily basis.< /Review>

Great service, good beer specials, and you can count on watching the fútbol games here. The reason why I dinged a star was because their method of busing tables, wasn't the most cleanly. They started piling dishes on a counter which was a little unappetizing to watch. Other wise, a good spot!< /review>< Pics>

Really good Mexican food in terms of Bay Area standards. Flautas had great flavor and texture; perfectly crunchy on the outside, right mix of flavors on the inside. Burritos are better than any other burritos I've had in the Bay Area. Pozole tasted like pozole, which is good. Salsa options are good; red and green and the best ones, we didn't really like the roasted salsa. Drinks were good too.< /text>

First impression the place is small but wasn't crowded. Got 2.50 tacos and a large quesadilla steak. The size of the food seemed s little smaller than a typical large or 2.50 taco. The tacos were good but need spice but you can get them at the sauce place where the free chips are. The quesadilla was ok, it was meaty but the taste wasn't that impressive.< /review>

Finally got to visit this taqueria: burrito is good and generous portion. The interior is the usual "fast food taqueria" style, don't expect a restaurant. Surroundings not amazing though.</review>

Anything on the menu is good, but a bit pricey for my pocket! But then again it's in Northern Cali!!</review>

The super burrito here is huge and a great deal. Definitely get your burritos to go though, this isn't a place I'd really be able to enjoy eating inside.<//Review>

<Text>Local taqueria with lots of seating -- they will run out of parking places first. First-timers will find the signage and procedure somewhat confusing. Burritos are large with generous meat portions. They put spicy red salsa on everything (even the chile verde - what's up with that?) so ask them to leave it off when you order if you're not up for it.</Text><time>1478407854091< /time><user_id>105325598368066377558< /user_id>< gmapID>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Garcia's is an unpretentious place, but the food is good and a great value.   Seriously, burritos as big as your head.  And everything looks fresh.  I had the Torte Carne Asada and it had jalapeños, pico de gallo, lettuce, tomato, onion and guac in addition to very flavorful and well textured meat.  I also got a very reasonably priced quesadilla that was served with onion, tomato, crema Fresca and avocado.  It was a nice combination of crunchy and creamy that brought out the flavor of the meal.  I saw a plate of nachos go by that could have served nine people.  I also noted that the tortopas were fresh and didn't taste like the oil was old the way they do in so many places.  Can't wait to go there again.  I want to try their seafood dishes!</Review>< userid>

I like Garcia's but depending on who is in the kitchen you may not get your burrito made your specification. Another thing to note is that you should tip with cash because I have been told that the management does not return tips to the workers if they are paid with a credit card. I think this handling of the credit card tips is abominable but I can't do much about it so I always tip in cash.</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The burritos are good, the tortillas are sweet (they are not like the Mexican ones).
The green enchiladas that I ordered are not like in Mexico with shredded chicken, they are with a type of chicken with a red sauce that tastes strange (I did not like the taste of the chicken with that sauce, it would be better just shredded).
Beans taste like canned ones.
Guacamole was very good.
The steak tacos are very well served and in general also the other dishes.

(Original)
Los burritos están bien, las tortillas están dulces (no son como las mexicanas).
Las enchiladas verdes que pedí no son como en México con pollo desmenuzado, son con un tipo de pollo con una salsa roja que sabe raro (no me gustó el sabor del pollo con esa salsa, sería mejor solo desmenuzado).
Los frijoles saben a los que son de lata.
El Guacamole si estaba muy bueno.
Los tacos de bisteck están muy bien servidos y en general también los demás platillos.</Text><user_id>112327881562001201131<//user_id>< user_name>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The food is very rich, but unfortunately the service is HORRIBLE, the waitress and the cashier (with guero and chongo hair) always walk with their face, it seems that one is going to ask for a gift. If they changed their way of treating the customer, surely their sales would be higher.
(Only a small observation)
Thank you.

(Original)
La comida es muy rica , pero por desgracia el servicio es HORRIBLE ,las mesera y la cajera (de pelo guero y chongo) siempre andan con su cara , parece que va una a pedir regalado. Si cambiaran su forma de tratar al cliente , por seguro sus ventas serian mayores..

(Translated by Google) Honestly last time that I come to this place, the customer service is terrible, it seems that those who attend were forced to work. If they don't like the job, let them get out and how bad the owner is so that he can see what kind of workers he has specifically (the blonde haired cashier) ✌👎👎👎

(Original)
Sinceramente última ves que vengo a este lugar, el servicio al cliente es pésimo, parece que las que atienden estuvieran obligadas a trabajar. Si no les gusta el trabajo que se salgan y lo malo que el dueño nunca está para que vea que tipo de trabajadoras tiene específicamente (la cajera de pelo güero)✌👎👎👎<//Text>
