Went to MedCenta Pharmacy  for a Covid PCR test, without having an appointment, though their site mentions the need to pre-register/make an appointment . The pharmacist was very nice and quickly showed me how to register online from my phone. Once I did that, I was instructed to go wait in the car. The pharmacist then gave me instructions on how to provide a sample and that was it! Very nice and prompt staff</text>

Great neighborhood pharmacy near Woodland Hills area, located in West Hills! Very friendly and helpful staff, and Robert is always a pleasure to speak with when needing my scripts filled. This pharmacy is like the old days of local ones in your neighborhood, where they offered better overall service compared to the large chains. I would prefer supporting a small local business whenever possible. They are worth the switch from the typical pharmacies!</Text>

<review>The BEST pharmacy around. I was a patron of the now closed DeSoto Pharmacy. I loved be able to ask the pharmacist questions, have my medications delivered, and not have to wait on hold for 30 minutes to talk to someone. Paul and his staff have been able to fill my need for these things. And they have been the best! They've dealt with my insurance denials, medication manufacturer requests, and everything else with professionalism, ease, and kindness. I HIGHLY recommend this pharmacy. It's so much better than any of the large chains and you are supporting a local small business. Also, I love their delivery option.< /review>< pictures>

I use to wave at Paul when I’d walk by with my dog because the door was open. When this pandemic hit I looked to them how I could get meds delivered and they took care of the calls and transferring of prescription. Felt very safe there and had my flu shot there in late August. They had gloves, alcohol wipes, 99% alcohol and mask every time. They have some greeting cards and tums and little things you need also. The delivery person is always great. I love this pharmacy and Paul is just the kindest. He actually delivered my prescription last time. Close to home and they are the best. I’ve found my pharmacy forever.
Thank you Paul and the entire staff 💕</review>

Paul the pharmacist is very nice and helpful , I think because he owns the business he seems to care for his customers more than other pharmacists I’ve been to. They can get you filled much faster than at the rite aid or cvs, No reason to wait forever at those big chain stores, go to Medcenter.< /Review>

I love this pharmacy where they actually greet me by name, and I never have to wait. When the stay at home orders began, I started using their home delivery and couldn’t be happier. My copay is no more than it was with mail order delivery from the big chain stores, and I appreciate the personalized service. I highly recommend!</text>

They know me by name, take time to talk to me about my health and medications, and I can always count on them 100% to fill my medications on time, help communicate with my Dr. if there is confusion over a prescription, and to go above and beyond to help.

<text>I’m so happy I found this pharmacy. Paul the owner is amazing. He is very professional and caring and really takes the time with you needs. He even delivers your meds if you can’t make it to the store. This place always has everything I need. I will never goto a corporate drug store again.< /text><user_id>113120934950040344017</user_id><pictures>None</pictures><gmap_id>0x80c29dc419754e9d:0xf92b50c48a1f5ae1</gmap_id>< Rating>

<review>If I could give infinite stars, I would. Medcenta offers THE ABSOLUTE BEST service you could imagine.  Paul and his staff always go above and beyond in making sure that prescriptions are filled quickly, with small town concierge service! Once you let Paul and Medcenta fill one prescription, you will NEVER go back to a chain pharmacy again.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Every time I visit MedCenta Pharmacy I'm greeted with a smile, care and concern.  I've never had a bad experience and when ever there is an issue with insurance or my medications, everything is explained to my satisfaction even if it is bad news regarding coverage issues/changes.

The cost of meds, if insurance doesn't cover them, is competitive and fair.

I just read a few days ago, they can fill veterinary scripts and may soon be able to do compounding, which is cool because I have a sick pet requiring a lot of medications. 💊</Review>< user_id>

I have been a customer of Medcenta Pharmacy almost since it was opened. Dr. Ghorbani has always been very patient and has assisted me not only with my medications, but with other medical supplies. His pharmacological knowledge along with his very friendly customer service makes MedCenta my favorite, one stop Pharmacy.</text>

I love that I can call up at anytime during business hours and my call is answered by a human and that knows me by voice. There's never hold time and I talk to the pharmacist when I call.
You have to love small personal businesses like this. I do what I can to keep my money with the little guy, so I don't have to be treated like a number. He takes almost all insurance too, just like the big corporate pharmacy's.👍</Text>

Great location for Mexican food. Stopped in on a Monday I think. I'll return family next time. Prices were decent. They have a lot of positive reviews for a reason.< /Review>

Hungry on a late night drive up the 101.  Pulled off the freeway and lucked into this gem.  Excellent food.  Excellent Service.  Just sad I don't live anywhere near it.< /text>

<Text>Awesome, unique cuisine. Food & service definitely worth the upper pricing. We were the only ones dining that evening. Definitely a hidden Jewel that I don't think very many people are aware of.< /Text>< pictures>

Saw that this was a little different than other Mexican restaurants. They offer typical dishes from Oaxaca. I shared the alebrije supreme. It was pretty darn good! It came with 2 sopes (not too different from other Mexican restaurants), 2 molotes (never had or seen on another mexican menu), and 3 empanadas.  I believe what the empanadas are stuffed with is authentic Oaxacan ingredients. DELICIOUS! I look forward to trying other dishes here.</review>

<Review>Great pool.  Very clean, perfect temp, 78-80°. Lifeguards.  Unfortunately, 45min limit during Covid and reservations required. Not easy to reserve but, doable. Get on the waitlist if necessary as they will and do call you when space opens.< /Review><time>1598668327499<//time><userid>113594664844325775509< /userid><Gmap_id>0x808e154ec4338591:0xa1603baa95b392cf</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Teachers take the kids swim education seriously without becoming ‘boring’. There’s plenty of fun yet our son made significant progressed in just one month. The only downside is that in the autumn there aren’t enough teachers so it’s really hard to get into classes after September.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

My 5-year old son and I went to Simpkins for the first time this past Saturday, and were duly impressed. There are different swim sessions open to different age/skill groups, so that was great for us as my son is just learning to swim, and would be distracted if older kids were in the pool with him. In "open swim", on certain weekend times, only kids 6 and under are allowed, which was perfect for us.

There are life guards at every pool/area, and they're very attentive, and we felt safe. The facilities were clean, the staff friendly, and prices reasonable ($6 for me and $4 for my son). We will definitely be going back soon.< /review>

<review>Nice pools, great for kids.
The management can be over zealous with the admission rules.
Charging parents admission who are never going to enter the pool and are just going to sit and supervise the kids (who have paid) is ridiculous.
The lifeguards are attentive and friendly and do a good job managing the kids.<//review><name>Mike Maraldo<//name><pics>None</pics><UserId.>118176620259967267730< /UserId.>< response>

<review>Our reason for hiring the Nieves Law Firm was not a fun situation, but from the very first phone call to the last communication, they put our concerns to rest.  Nadia was our first contact and she assured us that our case would be handled with the greatest of care.  Grace Goodman was our attorney and we cannot say enough about her confidence, poise and professionalism.  She was ALWAYS there to answer our questions (and we had a lot of them). She was always there to help ease our concerns.  Jo-Anna Nieves even joined us and our attorney on our day in court.

Hopefully, we will never have reason to use them again, but if we do, they will be the first phone call we will make!<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The Nieves Law Firm is the best choice for anyone with a pending criminal case or concern. In my experience referring clients to them and seeing their work, I’m impressed by the way they support and counsel their clients. Firm owner and principal attorney Jo-Anna Nieves always puts her clients’ interests first, and her staff maintains this focus on client care.

Jo-Anna is also an expert in post-conviction relief. This includes expungement, motions to vacate, plea withdrawal, and other forms of relief. With her years of experience and knowledge in this specialized area of criminal law, she helps clients clear their records and get a fresh start.

I highly recommend the Nieves Law Firm.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808f80b10e941577:0xcbf18dfdb5419ad<//gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating>< pictures>

I called The Nieves Law Firm seeking an attorney for Probate Court abuse issues. Though, it was not the area of law they practice, their Legal Administrative Asst. Nadia was more than cordial and professional. Usually, office personnel rush you off of the phone, but not The Nieves Law Firm. They even followed up with an email. Now that's Customer Service. Thank you for treating me with integrity and respect....it's rare these days. May your firm prosper abundantly! Blessings!< /Review>

I have been going through a really tough time legally, but when I called this law firm and unloaded my challenges on Nadia I instantly felt like I was talking to a friend. She immediately took the wheel, carry my load , and I honestly can say I felt the since of relief I new then that I was in good hands.
I would recommend any and everyone. I wish I could do more than just a review. Oh and the rates are reasonable. She will explain in detail what the procedure is so you can feel comfortable and rest at night knowing that you are in GREAT hands.
Thank you Nadia for all you do!< /review>

I was being held down from being able to succeed in life because of a Marijuana Felony I got charged with almost ten years ago. I “served my time” and paid all my fines and fees, but for years after my criminal record was keeping me from jobs, and being able to rent an apartment on my own. The Nieves Law Firm took the wheel and handled my case professionally, and in a timely matter. Throughout the process I slept soundly knowing that they were handling my case, and that they would bring back the freedoms I had taken away from me. They kept me updated throughout the process, shared documents with me along the way, and despite going through this during COVID times, they couldn’t have made it easier. I was able to work out a payment plan with them which was a big plus, making high quality representation attainable. I could not recommend them more!<//Text>

So far, my experience has been vey positive, and encouraging regarding the legal services that I am engaging in with Nieves Law Firm, and I have received other helpful suggestions and comments from the Nieves Law Firm that are unrelated to my case, but are very much appreciated non the less. I fully expect a positive resolution to my case, and will hopefully have a lasting relationship with the Nieves Law Firm in the future regarding any further legal issues that may arise.< /Review>

The best I ever seen , they got me everything I ever
Wanted , I no longer have to live in the shadows,
If you have any legal problems these guys will take care of it , specially if you need your criminal cases reopen and dismissed for immigration purposes it is worth every penny you spend with them , they will tell you in advance what they can do and what can’t do , I love ❤️ them they gave me my life back .< /Review>

<text>Jo-Anna stands out as a caring and compassionate person among the lawyer profession.

I was referred to Jo-Anna during some of the hardest times in my life and hired her. She went above and beyond to accommodate my needs.

I dont expect anyone to do anything for free, and lawyers aren't generally an affordable service. I was impressed by the care Jo-Anna showed for her client and the effort she put into the case. I am forever indebted, as is my family.

Since then she has founded the Nieves Law Firm and surrounded herself with a team of distinguished professionals, a sign of true leadership in the community.

Thank you!</text>< Pictures>

I had a questionable neighbor that became bullying; harassing and racist. I needed a restraining order. The Nieves Law Firm was able to assist me with that matter, and now said neighbor keeps to herself and is less intrusive.

They are approachable. I am in the process of trying to get legal representation for another matter and I'm finding lawyers who either have questionable listening skills and/or only care about money. While I understand everyone needs to make money, if money is the motivating factor and the customer service is highly lacking there is a problem. Fortunately, Nieves Law Firm had good communication and customer service and had a plan to work with me since I wasn't working when I sought their help.

I recommend them.</Text>

I had gone through two other attorneys before I decided to hire the Nieves Law Firm and I couldn’t be happier with my decision. They were compassionate and understanding of my needs and were able to help me resolve my matters at a fraction of the cost that I would’ve spent on other attorneys. My matters were extremely stressful and Chelsie was able to put me at ease on many occasions. When my case was finally over, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. Thank you Chelsie, Joanna and team for helping me through one of the most difficult times in my life. I wouldn’t have been able to do this on my own.<//review>

<text>Working with Jo-Anna Nieves and her team was a wonderfully empowering experience. I had been to a lot of attorney's offices before her's and I was worried my case was too difficult, expensive, and I was ready to give up. From the first intake call with Elaine I felt listened to and believed. Attorney D'Malta captured my feelings and experience vividly and wholeheartedly in drafting my complaints and responses. The firm even worked with me to figure out an extended payment plan when things we're becoming difficult for me financially. Nieves and her team not only stood up for me in court but encouraged me to stand up for myself.</text></record></dataset><record>

My family and I have suffered many years for the mistakes I made earlier in life. After many years  I realized it was my responsibility to accept those mistakes and to find a way to move on from them. Jo-Anna and her group assisted me greatly in finding a way to move on. I am deeply thankful and relieved that the Nieves Law Group helped me put my troubled past behind, start me off with a clean slate and be excited about my new life ahead.

Thank you< /review>

First of all I would like to thank Jo-Anna and the whole Nieves Law Firm. Jo-Anna is a very professional, informational, and intelligent woman. Jo-Anna and I made a deal regarding fees, and she stuck by her word even though the trial went on longer than expected. Jo-Anna was very well prepared, and genuinely cared to get me what I wanted. The results from court were everything i asked for. Jo-Anna's two paralegals, Monique and Ebony, were also fantastic and very helpful! Even couple weeks after my case was closed, they took the time to answer my questions and email my docs to appropriate people with detailed explanation. I would definitely use and highly recommend Nieves Law Firm.  Thanks again for all your help, you guys are awesome!<//Review>

Jo-Anna and her team at the Nieves Law Firm are fantastic!  Punctual, knowledgeable and hard working, Joanna has literally helped to make a dream become a reality.
With very serious charges hanging over my head for close to 20 years, it was time to clear my name.  To apply for (and receive) a Certificate of Rehabilitation is no small task, but Jo-Anna proved that she and her staff were more than able and willing to assist me.  At every step of the process she was prepared and informed, and at those times when I had questions or concerns she promptly handled or addressed those concerns, making for a comfortable and trusting environment.
I could not be more pleased with the service the Nieves Law Firm has provided to me.  I am eternally grateful for their helping restore my dignity and quality of life.
Thank you, Jo-Anna and Team!!!< /review>

I am so thankful to find Jo-Anna & her office. I must have contacted a dozen attorneys and could not find assistance. I was not a defendant in a case but the plaintiff. She was still willing to help me with my case. She was extremely responsive and kept me informed every step of the way. Her decisions were always in my best interest. I would defiantly recommend Nieves Law Firm.</text>

<review>A year ago i recieved a call from Jo-anna, asking if i was ready to handle my case. I wasnt sure so she mentioned she will call me in a couple months to check in. A whole year later of putting her calls aside, i decide im ready and still she calls. Now, my case has been settled completely in my favor, thanks to everyone at Nieves Law Firm who handled the case. I wish i had done so sooner but glad its over with now. They went above and beyond i thought was possible, they genuinely care, very detail oriented and best of all, honest. Cant thank you enough. Thank you everyone at Nieves law firm.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Loved the store so much! Great atmosphere and clothes, WONDERFUL customer service!!! I’m so glad they have a mask policy to keep their customers safe and well. Kelly was amazingly sweet and kind when I asked her for help, and another girl that was at the door handing out FREE masks to customers who didn’t have any. Definitely will be shopping here again and recommending the store to my family and friends!<//Review>< Date>

<Text>Your sales associate Kelly handled a woman who refused to wear a mask, professionally, and calmly! Great job keeping your employees, and patrons safe during this pandemic! Keep up the good work, and buy Kelly a few glasses of wine for putting up with these anti-mask morons! Btw, there's no condition that makes you not have to wear a mask! Even asthmatic can wear masks just fine!<//Text><response>None<//response>< pictures>

I went to this place and they treated me very nicely. They were kind to me, and they kept the other customers safe including me, when a lady was disrupting the store saying she has a "condition" that doesn't allow her to wear a mask. They treated the situation very calmly and professionally.</review>

I’m so sorry you had to deal with Valerie Taglione and her ignorance. Just like how establishments have the right to refuse service for not wearing a shirt or shoes...you have every right to refuse service for not wearing a mask. The governor has made it a requirement for masks to be worn. Also, that woman is an idiot for thinking you can get monoxide poisoning for wearing one.

Crossroads publicly discriminates against disabled people refusing to let them in without a mask, violating ADA Civil rights. I watched the manager, Kelly Hines, tell a disabled customer that it was the law to wear a mask, and then refused her service when the customer said it was not a law and that she had health issues and can’t wear one. Will never spend my money here again and will be making a complaint with the ADA for ADA violations.<//Review>

<review>Needed shoes and a shirt so I could go motorcycling.  Its a huge store with everything you can imagine. This was the second time here for me. My bf brought me here a few weeks ago.. and in a pinch, he brought me back..and told me i always need shoes! I was out the door under 60 bucks..and the shoes were perfect.<//review><UserId.>102938332906521262453<//UserId.><rating>5</rating>< Name>

<Review>There's a pretty big selection of a wide variety of styles here, and it is always clean and usually fairly well organized. Prices are great. The staff are friendly and happy to help if asked, but not in your face. I will say, however, that this is not the place to go if you are bigger than a size Large (hence the deduction of 1 star). They have a HUGE selection in XS and S, and a good selection in M and L, but I only saw a couple of items in XL.

I started shopping here when I was 19 and unfortunately, I am either aging or of their core demographic (I'm 31 now), or I am just really not into the current trends of crop tops, off the shoulder tops, and distressed tees (the first 2 of which are not functional for the mother of an active toddler). If those are your bag, though, check them out! And, if you read this review next season, they will have whatever is on-trend then.< /Review>< Response>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I hardly ever leave reviews - but this place sure deserved my review. Honestly so baffled by my experience here.

I walked in with 5 full bags of shoes and clothes to sell. All INCREDIBLE quality and brands like LuluLemon, Urban Outfitters, Zara, Free People, etc.

After waiting for 20 minutes for them to even call me up to get my clothes from me, I waited another 20 minutes for them to look through the clothes.

After almost an hour, one of the employees calls my name to let me know what items they were able to take. That being, 2 ITEMS. I was shocked and politely asked for reasoning, the reason being “these brands don’t sell that well for us.” Funny enough, the rest appeared untouched and only offered to take two items that were at the very top of the stack.

SHOCKED. And to top off my horrible experience, one of the two items was a gorgeous and close-to-new Lululemon jacket - he offered 10$ for it.

So, all in all, I would never recommend this place to absolutely anyone.

I should add: I’ve sold here once before a few months ago and they took the majority of my items for a decent cash back. Telling me “I have great items”. Then coming back to this - such a disappointing company.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Too bad the people here don't know their stuff.  I went in with 18 brand new kid Cudi T-shirts designed by Virgil Abloh in various sizes.  Market value for these shirts are $250-$300 since my shirts weren't packaged I was willing to settle for $80 a shirt, so you can imagine how I felt when I was low balled at $15 a shirt.<//text>

They are always nice to me, but I would definitely rate their overall service , garbage. Way too much employee talk behind the counters instead of working more efficiently right in front of customers waiting to be served promptly. Very unprofessional. I’ve had much better service at Plato’s Closet where 16 year olds work. They do tend to pay more- when they decide to very rarely buy an item from you.</text>

This is my favorite Crossroads location in Orange County. Most of their LA locations are great too, expect for the Studio City one. The Irvine Crossroads has a poor selection, their store is small, and mostly has fast fashion pieces that you could easily find at the mall already.
Anyway, this location is fabulous. It's their biggest location in both LA and OC. They have a fun staff, huge selection of various styles and trends for both men and women, and they have plenty of dressing rooms so there's never a wait.<//text>

BEWARE!!!! I caught asst manager Gabrielle in my dressing room stealing cash out of my wallet. She entered my dressing room where my personal belongings were while I was showing my wife clothes I tried on. She closed the dressing room door behind her and when I returned, she had all of my cash out of my wallet and in her hand. The rest of the employees and the actual manager, took her side which tells me it’s a scam they all have going. Police report made. Scumbag caught red handed!!! Costa Mesa store< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><time>1516491333777</time><Name>Angela<//Name><Review>This review is in regards to selling clothes at Crossroads.  I usually give my clothes to non profit thrift stores, however I am doing a very large closet purge and was hoping to get a little money to help replenish what I was getting rid of.  My clothes were in really good condition and a variety of seasons.  I took in 2 large bags and left them so I wouldn't have to wait for ever...first mistake.  When I came back they informed me that they were in this "wierd in between stage" where they weren't taking anymore winter clothes but weren't taking summer yet so they opted out of taking any of my pieces.  Um, then what the heck is left?  Anyway, when I got home and looked in the bags, it was clear they hadn't even gone through them AT ALL!  Everything that was on top was still there, and there were several pairs of jeans only worn 2-3 times still on the bottom.  If you can't take any of my stuff, fine, but don't lie to me as if you bothered to look through the clothes.  I agree with other reviews that unless it's designer or super brand name, they won't even bother!  What a sham!< /Review><user>110646851621830780906</user>< Resp>

Not much different from Buffalo Exchange except this place has a larger stock. I would probably opt to go to crossroads only because the location is more convenient for me and parking is much easier here than Buffalo.</Text>

<date>1511256668717< /date><review>Hi how can I get a hold of the owner or supervisor of the store? I had a really unpleasant situation with the store manager and i would like to address that with her superiors. I came in on Saturday morning when the store open, I was their with my mother, sister and my niece. When we came in my little niece which is 1 years old begin to cry and the store manager comes towards us very aggressive saying "im sorry guys I have kids of my own but if the little girl keeps being disruptive im going to have to ask you guys to leave" at that moment we were shocked by the way she behaved towards us. So my sister says nothing an decided to go back to the car with my niece, and for a moment I thought "Why does my sister have to leave when we've done nothing wrong just becuase a store manager dislikes noise or kid's in general. So I go outside and get my sister back in the store and I go talk to the store manager asking her to talk to a supervisor and she says no im the store manager, I said if you don't want any kid's making noise maybe there's should be a sign in the front door saying NO KIDS ALLOWED, and she adds
You could just have gone outside and told the little girl to keep quiet and I was even more shocked at her words I said "really im going to tell a 1 year old to keep quiet becuase the store manager doesn't want any noise" like a 1 year old is going to understand! She replies "im going to have to ask you guys to leave" and I say im sorry but why do I have to leave when im just asking to speak to a supervisor. If the supervisor or store owner is looking at this comment I would really appreciate if you can please have a word with this store manager she is a blond lady with both arms covered in tattoos she open the doors to the store Saturday 11/18/17. If someone is going to be store manager I would think they would be polite and respectful to their clients thank you!< /review><resp>None</resp>< rating>

<text>Just because I felt like they didn't want me there. The buyer, who was looking at the clothes I brought,  was talking to other employees the whole time behind the counter when I was literally in front of her. It's like she just wants you to go away.< /text>< userid>

I used to like this place and used to walk out with a bunch of gems but now they don't seem to to buy as many clothes and the options seem more generic now not the friendliest Place either<//Text>

Just wanted to thank everyone at this business! We were in need of an SUV and found the perfect vehicle. We had a great buying experience and all of our concerns were addressed! We have driven this truck everywhere and it purrs like a kitten!  I had my mechanic check the brakes and gave it a once over and he loved it so much, he offered to purchase it if we ever sold it! All it required was a new headliner and They were happy to help us offset the cost and contacted us the following day as promised. We went to Roman’s upholstery and were thrilled with the cost and the terrific job they did! We are taking the truck on a long road trip. They even called us about hurrying the registration and promptly contacted us the day it came in and dropped it in the mail that day! I would refer this company to anyone looking to buy a used vehicle. They went above and beyond in every way and sold us a great vehicle at a great price!  Thank you so much! Michael and Kim<//text>

<text>So let me just say that John had to be one of the friendliest guys youll ever get the pleasure to talk to. I went in to his shop after looking at several other cars in area and not only found i car i love, but we kept him a whole extra hour after the business closed so he could answer our questions. He knows his stuff, and gives me the confidence i needed to buy from him and Ill definitely be recommending him to my other friends when he gets new cars. If you wanna talk about a guy with a future ahead of him look no further than John.<//text>< pics>

This car dealership I purchased a GMC truck for my son today was such a great experience. John was the salesman who worked with me and made the process easy and his customer service was right on. I would recommend anyone looking to buy a car go and check them out. You will be happy you did. I will be coming back to them for myself and soon... Great service John to you and your dad. Keep up the good work and thanks so much. 🤗</review>

We went to Sierra Auto Sales in Auburn, CA after researching a lot of cars. When we called to see if a car we were interested in was still available, we were immediately impressed with the friendliness of John. He said, yes, it was still available and to come on over at our convienence. When we arrived, the car was pulled up in the shade, newly washed and ready for us to check out. John gave us the keys for a test drive. When we returned he stepped away and let us check it out without him hovering so we could privately discuss it. He didn't put on the high pressure sales pitch that we were dreading, instead he was gracious and respectful. We told him that we had another appointment to view a car. He thanked us for stopping by. We went to check out the other car a few miles away. We liked the car but the extreme contrast of the salesperson compared to John was why we chose to drive back to Sierra Auto Sales. You won't regret buying a car, SUV or truck from John. He made the deal seamless with zero pressure. We filled out the paperwork and off we drove with our new used 2012 Chevrolet Malibu back to Reno. Thank you for making purchasing a car a friendly, low stress experience!< /text>

I recommend this dealership completely, not only do they have great cars priced very reasonably, but their customer service is impeccable. Most car dealers are pushy and looking for commission, NOT THESE GUYS. If you need a car GO TO SIERRA AUTO SALES.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Currently, I am a college student, and was in need of a car. I went to many cars sales places, but John and Roy were the only ones who took my financial status into consideration, and found me a car that is very economically suitable, which fit within my budget as well. Compared to the other dealerships, these two marketeers were very kind. The service was amazing, and my car runs great. Thank you John and Roy.</Text>< Pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Disclaimer: In no way am I'm being endorsed for this review. This is mine and my wife's honest feelings. Please read to the end. I've had to purchase a few cars in my lifetime, and I have to say, this will not be your normal car buying experience. In the market, I was drawn here by a higher power. When I pulled up one Saturday morning I was greeted by a gentleman named Nick, come to find out he is the dad to John, helping his son out. Not doing any prior research on this business, I really didn't have a clue what I was getting myself into. But I'm glad I came here. After talking with Nick for about a half an hour or so and explaining my situation, family, job etc. We began a relationship that will last a lifetime. He to talked about his life, family etc. I explained to him that I would be in the market to purchase multiple vehicles as my wife was in dire need of one as well. With no real intension on buying a car so quickly, I had found the car I wanted and needed. Fast forward à week, I'm now driving my new car! Fast forward again another week, my wife is driving hers as well. The relationship that has been built over the past weeks is without a doubt one where my wife and I can stop in anytime and feel like we're visiting family. Let's meet the other 2 amazing people who make it all happen. Keeping this in mind, these are used vehicles and sometimes things happen, These guys, John and Roy, will and have bent over backwards to adjust, repair and guarantee a 100% satisfaction in a shopping and buying experience. There is no loss, just gain with this family owned business. Even if you're not going to purchase a vehicle right away, stop by and meet John and Roy. If you're lucky enough, Nick will be there to greet you with smile.</text>< pictures>

I purchased my first car here three months ago and John was amazing! I was a little worried at first cause the car is almost 20 years old. But it runs so amazing. I've roadtripped to Fort Bragg, Monterey and Fresno and the car has never given me any problems. I'm so incredibly happy and blessed with my purchase. I highly recommend this place. Thanks again!< /Review>

<review>Like most of the other reviewers here - we've had an awesome! experience with Roy. We bought a one owner, very clean, 2003 Toyota Sienna (175k miles) for our nice (and her 4 kids) and wanted something reliable yet affordable, he worked with us to figure out the paperwork and price etc. pressure free and no hassle. which is good enough to get 5 stars -

**** What made this experience EXCELLENT! and the need to give 6 starts was the on-going commitment of theirs to providing a great service. ***

Our excellent experience - briefly: I drove the van off the lot and down the road to get gas, however could not get anymore than 50c in the tank. I immediately went back to see Roy and we double-checked that indeed there was something going on. Without hesitation he said he would take care of it (at no charge to us) if we could leave the car with him. A few days later we got the van back with the issue resolved, we thought, but at the next tank fill up, same thing - and when we called Roy he again told us to leave it with him to get it fixed (which he did). Car has been running fine for over a month now and several tank fill ups!!!

There aren't many dealers who will make sure they stand by their word and reputation - we know they, and in particular Roy will!

BTW if you google this - it's a very common problem with either spiders making webs in the EVAP canister or bugs making nests in the vent tubes and clogging things up - seriously!! who'd have thought it would have been insects!!!!< /review>< date>

Came here to buy a 4runner and I was pleasently surprised at the level of professionalism and courtesy that was provided to me during the entire experience. From the initial inquiry about the vehicle to the final purchase, John and Roy were brilliant. They were straight forward with all of the information about the 4runner along with giving me helpful tips about our 4runner. Appreciate everything that they've done to help me y'all. Will be back when we need another vehicle!!<//review>

<Review>I can't say enough about these guys. John and Roy are very friendly, courteous and genuine. I got a great deal on a truck and am very pleased. They were very accommodating and seemed to really care about me as a person. We joked around a bit and I think I could be friends with these guys. Quite unusual for a car buying experience. I wanted to make some changes to the contract the next day and they were very willing to work with me and took care of everything. Great experience. I highly recommend Sierra Auto Sales.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I've been searching for somewhere to buy a car for awhile and I'm so glad I found this place! John was very helpful during the whole process and really made me feel confident about my purchase. Great customer service and I'd 100% recommend this place for anyone who is in the process of searching for a car.</review>

I purchased a Ford F-250 a while back. It was a great experience in dealing with them. They answered all of my questions thoroughly, and went above and beyond to make sure I got a quality vehicle. I appreciate their honestly and would be more than happy to do business again someday.< /review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Text>I found Sierra Auto on Car Gurus. They had several cars I was interested in. I was planning on buying a car at another dealership but absolutely fell in love with a Hyundai Sante Fe. The price was right in my price range and incredibly low miles. Two major factors while car shopping. As soon as Roy introduced himself, gave me the information I needed, and the keys for a test drive, I knew that was my car. He made it painless and quick. We agreed on a fantastic deal. I couldn't be happier or say enough nice things about this dealership. Roy was not your pushy,  typical  salesman. He was real, gave me the information I wanted and gave me my space to look around. He was very accommodating.
I would highly recommend these gentlemen. They are honest, hardworking, and love what they do.
Thank you Roy! I will definitely be giving you future business and letting my friends know that you're the ones to go to. Such a great experience.

My husband just bought me a Nissan Armada from John and Roy at Sierra Auto Sales and it was the best experience we had buying a car from anywhere, we feel we were treated fair and with respect which means a lot to both of us so if you are considering buying from there make no hesitation you will be in great hands.

<review>This is a fantastic place to buy a used car. Last month, I purchased a 2006 Infiniti G35 Coupe from Sierra Auto Sales and I got a great deal on it. John and Roy are very friendly and they simply let the car sell itself. They were very patient and they answered all of my questions. They were not pushy at all. I was very surprised to experience this, because most car dealerships are the exact opposite. I'll definitely be back again, to purchase my daughter's first car!<//review>< Name>

These guys are the real deal ... they are sincere, competent, professional, and flexible. I appreciate their time, staying past closing time to answer questions and process my paperwork. I worked specifically with Roy who has a genuine regard for his customers and fulfilling their needs. I got a great deal on a 2007 Subaru Outback that was clean and well maintained. I'll definitely be back when I'm ready to purchase again!</Text>

John, with welcoming hands, helped  us and took us on the tour showing a wide variety of vehicles.

We've been looking for a truck for two months. We couldn't find a good deal until we've found Sierra Auto Sales. I was very impressed by the service and the good deal they offered us. The car was in pretty good condition and I'm very happy with the purchase. I've been driving the car for 4 months and it runs great. I highly recommend this dealership!</review>

As a senior in high school, I was anxiously looking for a car to take to college. After looking for months online, I noticed Sierra Auto Sales and it’s outstanding reputation of 5 star reviews. So, naturally, I decided to stop by. Within moments, of stepping on to the car lot, I was greeted by John, who by the way was super helpful, humble, down to earth, and most importantly not pushy at all! I could tell he was a genuine and stand up guy and felt very comfortable. I always figured buying a car would be full of headaches and hassles, but with Sierra Auto Sales it was frustration free!! Check them out before you go anywhere else!!< /text>

<text>I really wanted to write a review when I first bought my 2014 VW Jetta from these guys.  I decided to wait and see how things went.  Its been almost 6 months and I absolutely love my car. I cannot even believe how straight up these guys are.  They truly do sell good cars and are willing to work with you.  My son made them an offer that I did not think they would agree on but they did!!!  My car is awesome.  It runs great and I am more than pleased.  We will be buying a car for my son soon and we are definitely going here first!< /text>< pictures>

<Time>1537641915098<//Time><rating>5<//rating><review>We had a great experience here. We initially met up with John to look at and test drive a vehicle for our daughter to replace hers that was totaled in a recent accident.  We were impressed with the vehicle and after the test drive left for lunch and consider the purchase. During lunch we decided that John was so honest and genuine that we would take a look at another vehicle of his and after the second test drive decided to buy both vehicles at once and end our search for both vehicles that we were in the market for. We will soon be looking for another vehicle for our other daughter and will definitely start with John at Sierra Auto Sales first and would recommend anyone to start their used vehicle search here as well.  John is great and has all Carfax reports prior to your asking.  Great job John, Thank you.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>My family has purchased two cars from sierra auto's and so far we have had an amazing experience. John is the main man to speak to. He's very polite, honest and sincere. He got straight to the point. I have to say John did a fantastic job breaking down the specs of each car. Moreover, the quote he gave us was precise and out the door. Unlike any other salesmen there were no hidden fees!</Text>< Resp>

John and Roy are amazing. Losing a vehicle during the Camp Fire, my family was struggling to find a good deal on a good car. Luckily I stumbled on Sierra Auto Sales Inc. Roy and John made the whole process of buying the vehicle a breeze, clear explanation of everything, and a fantastic and clean selection of cars.< /Review>

John was patient, honest and not pushy at all. He's a genuinely kind person. He answered all my questions on the car, responded quickly to my calls and offered a very reasonable, fair price on my vehicle.  I've already recommended him to family members and I won't hesitate to come back the next time I'm in the market for a new car.  Thanks John!< /review>

I bought a Lexus SUV from here over a year ago and I got a really great all cash deal. The SUV is in great shape. I drove out over two hours togo pick it up and it was totally worth it. I had gone to countless private sellers and dealerships who wasted my time by flat our lying about the condition the SUVs were in. These guys were very flexible and communicative. When we got there we noticed a back light was cracked and they had a new one sent to our house.<//review>

Everything about my experience here was awesome. I love the car I bought, I love how easy the whole process was and I love how awesome Roy and John are as a team! It really shows they care about their customers and the cars they are driving home. If I’m ever on the hunt for another car, I’m going here for sure.< /review>

He works hard to provide a good car, deal, and experience for his customers. He would never intentionally sell a bad vehicle to someone and sends all of his cars through inspections and fixes found problems before putting them on the lot. Overall had a fantastic experience and wish John good luck in the future!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Review>We were looking for a Subaru Impreza. We drove all over and luckily found Sierra Auto Sales.  John and Roy were fun to work with - we found a car we liked for a good price and are very happy with it.  We highly recommend taking a look at Sierra Auto Sales next time you are looking for a used car!< /Review>< Time>

Bought a car from them 4 months ago, paid cash and got a good deal at $4500 for a 2008 hatchback that is clean and runs great still! These guys were genuine, didnt hassle me, and didnt try to push me into a car, which was a first for a car lot! A monitor light came on and they got it fixed promptly.  Overall I had a good experience, and they stayed late to allow us to do paperwork (we drove down from Chico)
One thing I will say- take note that almost all of their reviews are fake from profiles with only one review and nothing but praise. I did find that odd.< /Text>

<Review>I recently purchased a Volkswagen Jetta from Sierra Auto Sales. The guys working here (John and Roy) are very nice. They were helpful and even allowed me to get the vehicle inspected by my mechanic before purchasing. When I asked about the service records for the vehicle, they provided me with a Carfax history report which showed 32 detailed service records for the vehicle. These guys know what they are doing and I will refer all my friends and family to purchase their next car from Sierra Auto Sales. Most of all what I really appreciated about them, was that they were NOT pressuring me into a sale.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809adac240674049:0x8bb56ff21a98fadc< /Gmap_id></record>

Buying a used car can be troublesome at times, however John, the sales rep who helped me, made buying a used car simple and stress free. All the cars he sells are looked over by a professional mechanic before he puts them up for sale, and so far my car has been running perfectly. John gave me a great deal on my car and I am very happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy from him again!</text>

I am so glad I bought a Toyota Camry from here. It is hard to find an honest and excellent customer service. The cars are reasonably priced and they gave me a fair price for the car that I traded in. The process went really smooth. I will strongly recommend Sierra Auto Sales to anybody who is looking for an awesome and reliable car.< /Text>

I purchased a car from Sierra Autos about 3 months ago. Wanted to wait some time before I wrote a review about this used car delearship. This is my second car that I have bought in my entire life and I have to say that I had a fantastic experience. John, the salesman who helped me did an amazing job answering all my questions and concerns. The process was very smooth, transparent and quick. I guess the biggest concern that I had was whether the car would be reliable or not. However, in these last 3 months I would say thankfully I have not experienced any problems. My new Infiniti g35 is treating me well. Thank you John & I highly recommend this place to anyone in the market  looking for an update in their life.<//review>

<text>I normally don’t fill out surveys, but I decided after this vehicle purchase that Sierra Auto Sales and John deserved credit for my wonderful buying experience. I have purchased many vehicles throughout the past ten years or so and this was hands down the most pleasant buying experience I’ve had.< /text>< pictures>

SCAM ARTISTS.  DO NOT BUY.  2 minutes after driving the car off the lot, check engine light turned on.  The car needs a new catalytic converter.  Craigslist ad was disguised as a private party sale.  Salesman also tried to pocket an extra $100 from me that was nowhere on the contract.</review>

If you're looking for real realiable used car , i'd say you find the right spot .John knows what he's talking about and he never goes around the point just to make a sale like any other dealers. I'm a mechanic myself , and my experience with John is such undescribable. My girlfriend and I drove all the way from Seattle to check out his Subaru WRX ( stick shif - as I've been looking for this model and seems like no where else carried the one I wanted), it was so unfortunate that the car has a little problem with the front hub, so even I insisted John that it's not a big deal that i could handle it myself ( I really wanted to get this car), John wouldn't sell it for the reason that he didn't want to jeopardy his reputation. He was so nice to offer us half the what we paid for the night over in Sacramento with his promise that he would fix the problem within a day and wouldn't change the price as it was. So we got this car the next morning . The price was fair , and the car was in perfect condition . But it's not about the car , but the service of Sierra autosales made us feel fully respected and trusted. I'd totally recommend John for anyone who's looking for used cars with in their budget that goes along with top-notch service.</review>

I am so pleased with the help I received by Maribel at the Bell Pasenda Apartments.  My daughter is moving into the building and we had so many questions and she was so pleasant and extremely helpful to answer all of them.  Even the silly ones. I also would like to mention how efficient she was in dealing with all the road blocks we encountered being an international renter.
I would recommend calling or emailing her to find all the answers your looking for.
Thank you again Maribel.  I am so looking forward to meeting you in person and my daughter having safe place to live.< /text>

< Review>
I have visited this apartment complex twice in the last 2 months during our long search for the perfect apartment in the Pasadena area, and Bell apts. are still my favorite. There are so many floor plans to choose from and the look of each unit is unique and modern.

Maribel has helped us every step of the way. By the end of our first visit she knew exactly what we were looking for and has made the perfect recommendations. We have been in constant communication with her and she has made this apartment search easier than any other sales rep we've worked with. She is a pleasure to speak to anytime we have a question or concern. We appreciate her directness, availability and energetic personality! Thanks again for all of your help!:)<//Review>

My experience at Bell was so refreshing and smooth. Maribel helped me through the entire process of showing me the apartment and amenities and went even further to email me virtual tours of spaces that were more accommodating to what I was looking for. She is seriously the sweetest and most helpful soul! it really made my experience in looking for a new home really easy and I dont think people usually say that about apt hunting. Everything afterwards such as applying and getting things in order  - what would have been a headache because 2020 was an absolute mess - was another SMOOTH process due to Maribel's willingness to help us gather all the information we needed. Overall, she set such a warm and welcoming first impression which really directed me in wanting to live at Bell (aside from the beautiful space itself haha)

Update: we’re finally moved in and everyone has been so helpful. We had a small maintenance issues in the apt but when we put in a request for help. Julio responded immediately and fixed it! Thanks Julio!

We love it here already!< /Text>

My potential roommates and I came to tour for move in mid 2021. The property is great, in good location and the units are a good size for a decent price. Our experience with the office staff (Chelsea and Ben) was great. Both are well informed and more than willing to answer any questions, even if you have 50 like we did. I can't wait to make this property my home.</review>

I came to tour this weekend with my mom who is looking to move early next year and was extremely impressed with this property. Chelsea toured us around amazing units with nice views. I'm hoping that we can make this place a home for my mom since I definitely feel safe leaving her here. At the end of the tour, Chelsea gave us a bag of mints! Talk about top notch!</Review>

This facility is absolutely amazing! The staff here and the management make it so cozy. Management is always helpful and makes the residents their top priority. The facility is also kept up very well and the amenities are awesome! (My favorite parts are the spacious recreation areas). Overall a great facility!</text>

<review>Bell Pasadena used to be my home and I had to go back and write a review. If you're loking for a place in Pasadena, look no further. Bell has great units for prices that mean luxury. In a great location with tons of shopping. The office staff when I was there was Ben, Chelsea and Will. They are nice and act like they truly care about their residents. Maintenance, Nick and Julio were great too. Only issue is the homeless in the area, but that's most places in CA. So sad I had to move.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1605558051870, 'text': "Thank you for leaving your feedback for Bell Pasadena.

<review>My boyfriend and I came to tour the Bell due to a new move to the Pasadena area. We were greeted by Chelsea, who took us to view a couple of the 1 beds on the property. She was very kind, professional and knowledgeable not only of the property but also the area since this is new to us. The property is clean, the units are spacious and the pricing seems on point for the area. We love the island kitchen and large soaking tub. We aren't looking to move until the beginning of next year, but the Bell is definitely top of our list. We look forward to hopefully making this our home and working with Chelsea again!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2dc9dec6c62bd:0xd5d832fdc9c34ccf< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

Bell Pasadena is a great place to live. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. You can always reach out to Ben or Chelsea and they will have an answer. I have enjoyed living here. The area of course has homeless but tell me where in CA you won’t find homeless walking around.</Text>

I have lived in luxury apartments as well as low level apartments before. This apartment is not cheap and there are things that I am not happy about this building.
1- It is right on the highway, even though my apartment is in the middle of the building, I can still hear all the highway noise very much, specially in early morning when I need very quiet time for sleep.
2- There are mandatory charge for internet and TV package, which I do not use TV at all. This is not acceptable.
3- The walls are so thin you could hear the slightest music. My neighbors are banging on the walls all the time for those who have any music going.
4- Pool is 3 feet deep, which is very shallow, it should have been at least 3'6". I was hoping that my daughter can learn how to swim, but with very shallow pool, it is not possible.
5-The closet in the second bedroom is so small
6- One side of the building does not get sun light at all and is very dark, so make sure, pay attention to that.
7- The hard wood flooring are not very tight, and are noisy
8- One bathroom has no tub in the 2 bedroom and only head shower.
9- I have to pay extra for the second car parking. If I have 2 bedroom I expected to have 2 car parking. It is not even reserved and $75 is not cheap.
10- Outside is a commercial area only, no residential, so if you like it, its ok.

Chelsey and Ben are very quick to respond and nice, but the policy is not changing.<//Text>

I absolutely love living at The Ellington in Pasadena, California!  These apartments are beautiful as they're newly constructed with a sleek and modern feel.  The community is one of the best I've ever been a part of.  Management is friendly and takes care of residents as well as their needs in a timely manner.  Maintenance responds to order requests quickly and ensure quality work.  It has a thriving warm community and is dog/family friendly.  The central location of The Ellington is crucial.  It is located near the Gold Line metro station, Old Town Pasadena, the freeway and the Hastings Village with many shopping options.  Their amenities are also very attractive: a fitness center, swimming pool + cabanas, outdoor fire place, BBQ grills and courtyard + corn holes.  I am stoked to be living here and to be a part of this community!</Text>

The staff at Bell Pasadena is great! From the leasing staff, Maintenance staff, to even the nightly security are all friendly and professional! Always very welcoming with any questions or concerns. The maintenance supervisor Nick is very friendly and always takes the time to explain everything. He goes out of his way to make sure any work orders I have placed are completed in a timely manner and done correctly! Goes above and beyond and it’s  very much appreciated. Customer service from the staff is definitely great! I have no complaints. Definitely love thing here!<//Text>

<review>The Ellington is an amazing community.  They are one of the newest places to live and have a perfect location near shopping, old town Pasadena, the metro, and the freeway.  The apartments are spacious and well laid out with beautiful finishes.  They have every amenity I need, with one of the best Fitness Center's I have seen in the area.  They have  a pool, bbq pits, club room, a smaller zen type courtyard, and a beautiful viewing terrace with the San Gabriel Mountains as a back drop.  I am very happy to be living here.  The staff is friendly, responsive, and made the moving transition pretty easy.<//review>< username>

These guys are crooks. I filled in application. They SAY they lost it even though I had a copy emailed to me from them saying they received it. Then they asked for a $297.50 deposit to hold the apartment or you can't move in. So I give it to them and 2 hours later I get a decline letter AFTER they took my deposit, no explanation as to why. Then they say they won't refund my deposit for 30 days. SCAM CITY to make money off deposits.

As of this writing, it has been more than 21 days and I still haven't gotten my money back from these crooks as required by California law. They've sent me other mail so they obviously have my correct address< /review>

I downsized from a house with a pool and thought this place would be temporary; however, it has been so convenient to markets, metro, 210 fwy, restaurants; and now I am enjoying NOT dealing with a house, yard, maintenance etc.   I do not recommend this place for families with young children (4 to 12) because it is mostly young professionals, single units, bachelors (etts), or families with babies (ie don't need a yard).    That being said; it is great for couples or single people as it has a pool, BBQ, community room, conference room etc.    East Pasadena is a great place to live and it does not have nearly as much traffic as the Westside or OC.     You get 1 parking spot for a 1 bedroom; and $75.00 extra for each extra auto.   Also, you can rent storage space if you need it.

The place is new; management is on top of things; and it is safe and clean.   For apartment living; it gets high marks; and the tenants community always seems nice and respectful.</Review>

Jack-in-the-box on Milburn/Herndon is always running out of food. Sometimes they would replace food items to complete the order. Ordered a loaded breakfast sandwich and had no ham slices. Ordered ultimate breakfast sandwich and had no sausage. Ordered a sausage croissant sandwich and had white cheese instead of the yellow cheese. This has been ongoing since last year. Had to drive to Shaw/West Jack-in-the-box to get better service and completed orders.</text>

Its 730pm and the lobby is locked. Been im line for the drive thru for 15 minutes still 2 cars in front of me to order. Two cars between ordering and window. Line isnt moving. No one answering business phone. 5 minutes before they asked for the car in front of me to order. Waited another 5 minutes to order. Refused to take 2 orders thru drive thru but the lobby is locked so I can't go inside like I originally wanted to. Will never return to this location. Would live to talk to a district manager. Paid at 747. Asked for hot food and the girl rolled her eyes and closed window. Given old fries at 750. No one acknowledging me until 752. Someone in regular clothes. Received hot fries at 757. I will never be back to this location. Girl at window is a shift leader without a name tag and should be demoted for such poor customer service.< /Text>

Went through the drive thru 30 minutes before closing just to be told they weren't taking any new orders because they were short staffed. I had to back out of the drive thru along with 2 other cars who were refused service.</review>

This place refused to serve us since our cargo van could not fit in the drive thru. The manager slammed the door in our face. Im still shocked!! We are essential workers and just wanted a bite to eat.

Service and professionalism here is way below par.</Review>

So I used to think this place was ok and I had given them 3 stars for it but now is nothing but bad customer service and bad cold nasty food, I go here very often and at different times but it seems like it don’t matter what time I go the wait time takes at least 30 mnts and for the food to be cold!!! Sooo disappointed, tonight I had enough!!! I ordered a sriracha burger and what I received was honestly a 99 cents worth burger to be honest, it was cold and disgusting I couldn’t even enjoy it! Will be calling corporate!<//review>

We requested three separate orders (which was the best option considering how many people we had in the car) but they would only allow us to do two, which isn't good customer service in my opinion 🤷🏼‍♀️ I would think you're supposed to favor the customer and their order, not how long it takes you to complete the order. We're the ones who are paying your business, and I would think that you could do three separate orders for a car with a bigger amount of people.<//text>

<Review>The lobby is closed, so you can't even walk in & order, every other fast food place is open inside 🤔 what's up with that? I haven't been to jack in the box in a few years & wow their food has gone down hill. Found out today they charge for ranch 27 cents, this is new to me I figured it would be complimentary since I got a chicken sandwich. My boyfriend's fajita was cold & the cheese wasn't even melted. We had to call them via phone, cuz the drive thru is 6+ cars; that's a whole lot of waiting. They offered to make him a new fajita, so that's the reason for my 2 stars.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

If you look everywhere, the new Chicken box comes with fries.  This is false advertising.  You have to get the meal to get the fries to be included in the box.  Nowhere anywhere does anybody or anything tell you this, you just have to order and get tricked into paying for something you didn't expect.  This is something an adult would do to a child as a joke, not something a well established franchise company does to its paying customers. Not only is this false advertising, this is Jack in the Box being very cheap.  Its on the level of buying potato chips and it being 70% air.  Without the french fries to fill up the box you get a carton of regret.  Shame on the franchise as a whole.....<//Text>

<Text>Service was good, but food was cold...  onion rings were over cooked..  the tacos were crunchy on the outer sides and soggy in the middle.   Seems like they had been sitting for a while.  Disappointed because usually Jack in the Box is fairly good.< /Text><Response>{'time': 1574786999103, 'text': "We're disappointed to hear that, Angelica.

To be honest this is one of the dirtiest Jack's I have been too. The bathroom is really gross and trays are way sticky. Food was ok but place needs a bath.</Review>

Unfortunately this location has gone downhill. We have lived in this area for more than a decade. We use to eat here more often, but the fast food line is a super long wait, they often have gotten things wrong in the order and we are overall unhappy with the newest staff. (It changes a lot) There was a manager that use to work here that always got the job done right, but we havent seen him in forever and the service has suffered. Please get the act together. If you can't run things right, maybe a change is needed. $10/meal can be spent at other burger places with good service.</review>

Went to get my just a breakfast sandwich for my son, ended up waiting about 15 minutes for it. I waited 10 minutes just  at the at the drive thru screen until they finally took my order. This is not the first time this is happened, but it's the closest Jack in the box. But just my think of going somewhere else for breakfast sandwiches. Very slow fast food!< /review>

If you are in a hurry or want even good customer service  this is NOT the Jack in the Box for you. I was literally waiting for 14 min and asked about my food and they said only after I asked that they had given part of my order to someone else.  So now I am having to wait even longer. And, the thing is, they weren't even busy.  They did give me a desert and more chicken strips for my wait. But, does that really make up for not  being upfront about what was going on in the first place?<//review>

<Text>The drive thru line wait has been ridiculous right now. It's far too long wait, when there were only 4 cars in front of me after I placed my order. And then I finaly get home with my order to find out the food that I was given wasn't even correct. I will not be returning to this location. Called to complain and the manger basically made excuses for why it was a horrible wait and my order wasn't correct. I don't expect to much from fast food places but you can at least give people what they order.</Text><rate>1< /rate><user>105978004714256530195<//user><GmapID>0x809468ccf20c6707:0x1a6c4e1077a585fb<//GmapID><response>{'time': 1577117397991, 'text': "Thanks for letting us know about this, Rachel.

Used to be pretty good, but quality has gone down over time. Orders are frequently incorrect, some staff can be rude, and the food itself is rarely appealing. Would recommend finding somewhere else to eat when possible.< /Text>

<text>This place has really gone way down hill. Not that it was ever great to begin with but come on, it's taken worse to an all new level.  Why work in customer service if you don't have any customer service skills? That is a question that these employees need to ask themselves.  Poor customer service skills equal loss of business.  The food, the rudeness, dirty restaurant and bathrooms.   I won't be going back at all.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>So, its 10:30 on a Saturday night.  Im late night hungry,  not wanting to get out of my car,  I go to the drive thru to hear,  "our drive-thru register isn't working,  you have to order inside." Are u kidding me? You have how many registers up front and you're going to turn down all Saturday night drive thru customers because you can't hop on another register to take my order?! Who runs this place? Better yet who owns this place? Get better managment!</text>< Gmap_id>

Must have got a new manager or something because it's super slow dirty and the employees talk to each other about what are they going to have for dinner instead of taking a customer's order. Unbelievable! This Jack in the box is a joke it needs to be closed up<//Review>< pics>

The workers are rude. When I asked how long the wait was gonna be I was told by the manager that she had no idea how long it was gonna be because there was a line in the drive thru, when I asked so even though I came inside I have to wait for the drive theu line to go down and she said yes. I really hate coming to this loction. I hope they make changes soon #upsetcustomer< /text>

The guy in the drive through at night was literally mean to me. I usually go and get my usual meal and this time around I misunderstood their drink options because it was a little hard to hear and I apologized for it since it was my fault i didnt understand. But they didnt care they gave me a small drink filled with ice and a little bit of the drink I wanted. Since I barely have the money I just have to take what I have but I genuinely thought it wasnt cool at all.< /Text>

My single patty burger *eventually* arrived cold, small and dry as a bone atop a few lifeless greens in a disposable bowl. I ordered sautéed mushrooms on my burger- I didn't get them. "Bar and Grill" typically suggests a wine selection. Nope. Only two wine options. Also, not a single employee was wearing a mask. I suppose that's common in Tulare County. I'll never return.< /review>

Nice restaurant,  good location. The burger and onion rings were very good and you receive a lot of food. The service was a little scattered and quite slow.<//Review>

The bartenders were just talking with eachother and didnt move with even the tiniest bit of urgency. They all seemed like pretty amateur bartenders and barracks. I get it, you're busy, but at least move as if you're showing a sense of urgency. The bartender FINALLY took our order and charged my friends card for EVERYTHING, not once asking if we were splitting checks.. all in all, food, AMAZING..atmosphere was blah...and service and wait at the bar was terrible. Wont be back.< /Review>< pics>

Burgers are always good, but...
Coworkers and I just got them for lunch. I was sitting right next to my coworker when she called in the order. Two barbeque burgers, one with cheddar, one with pepper jack, and a 5 item salad. When I got there, they had for some reason added a side salad, but they took it off so whatever. Then after I paid I saw the receipt said American cheese on both burgers. I told the guy working that it was supposed to be 1 pepper jack one cheddar, and he said it was just that way on the tag, but the burgers should have the right cheese. They were both American, and they forgot the dressing on the salad. Pretty basic stuff to mess up. Also they didn't ask if I wanted ketchup but whatever some places don't do that. 0/3 on this order. So I guess if you eat here just make sure they get your order right. Otherwise it's really good food< /text>

Horrible customer service. Ordered, waited half an hour to find out order wasnt placed. Staff then laughed and made snarky disrespectful comments when it was brought to their attention that they wasted my wifes lunch break and ruined our anniversary lunch date.< /Text>

I love there food. The vibe is why I really go. My favorite bartender is Bryan! He makes this pink flower drink that is delicious. I think that's what it is called. With Covid going on this place has the perfect set up.</review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>I went for lunch and had a salad that had nice greens and dried up processed mostly fried batter that was supposed to be chicken. My son wouldn't drink the vanilla shake and he never passes on sugary dairy products. My guy thought his burger was just ok but definitely not worth the price. The food was overall very expensive for what you get. This is a great place to have drinks and fries while people watching at their beautiful bar area on a weekend.<//text>< Pictures>

I was really excited to try this restaurant,  but the service is awful. We ordered our food, no problem, but we waited for over an hour with nothing. Our number was not called. We decided to check what was going on and surprisingly they lost our order. I understand being busy and trianing, but losing an order is crazy. We were not the only ones complaining either. At first they only offered us 10% off our order, a measly $5 off, but they were kind enough to give us $20. That is before everything got worse. We finally got our food and almost all of it was cold. The worst of it was the fact we found hair in the food, not a loose hair, a piece of hair cooked into the food. I am never coming back to this establishment. This is appalling.<//text>

service is hit and miss. Young girl with blue hair was very rude and unhelpful when we were ordering. When we asked questions about the menu her response was short and handled rudely. When I got my food it was a hamburger patty on a piece of lettuce, not worth 8.50. Surprised if this business will last with rude staff that doesn’t put effort into making a burger.< /Text>

Food is awesome.....takes a while to get your food....Been here several times...3rd time the AC was out in summer while I was there.. Come on guy's.....Plus you need installation on the ceiling if you plan on keep you customers comfortable in the summer. People are turning around and leaving cuz it's just to hot. Spring for 10 fans or something guy's! That is why I gave this rating....3 times Ac is out  just means you cut corners on the install....your losing $ because of it.
Fix it RIGHT!!!!
I will gladly give you a 5 star rating!

****Update I've went back to Stacked several times since my not so good review. Ac worked everytime!! I'm glad they are getting it together. Food is still terrific!! They do need to work on keeping the drink area stocked and clean. I said I would charge my review if they got it together...still can't give it a 5 yet!< /text>

<time>1556281160843<//time><Rate>4</Rate><review>Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, good food, fairly decent beer selection. I had the Italian burger and to me the I ingredients just didn't go well together. This was my first time here and I wanted to try o e of their burger combinations. I wouldn't get the Italian again though. The sausage didn't go well with the burger. I honestly though the marinara was going to be weird but it wasn't a bad combo with the patty. Other than that everything else was great. Had a few beers from the bar. The onion rings were good, the standard fries and nacho fries were pretty good also. They seem to get a fair amount of Grub Hub orders too. There were quite a few order pick ups from them. Would definitely go back and try making my own burger combination. This is like the place in Kingsburg in case you're wondering.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80952f3ab6063563:0xeb9c0fd480ffdef1</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Food was good the fried pickles were yummy. I didn't like like that I wanted a drink and I had to go to the back and order and pay there. I wanted to do one transaction, plus the bartender didn't know how to make a strawberry margarita.

Had a to go order. Ordered 2 burgers, fried pickles and a shake.Burgers aren't anything to be excited over only highlight was the buns. Once we were home the two burgers didn't have any marks to indicate which burger was whose (the only difference was our cheese and both were white type of cheese).Had the fried pickles and they were way too salty, didn't enjoy them since you couldn't enjoy a flavor just salt and some spice. The way they're prepared it's in long slices and they sort of fall apart. Had a milkshake and it tasted so-so with possibly from the store whip cream. Didn't come w a straw and didn't realize until we were driving in the car since we thought a straw would be in the bag. Not planning on going back anytime soon when there's better burger joints in Visalia.<//text>

<review>So I went in with an open mind.  Ordered the specialty bbq, bacon cheeseburger,  single party. The burger was ok. Didnt blow my mind and the prices seem way to high. For the price compared to the quality of the food, I would take the whiskey river bbq burger at Red Robin all day long. $12 just for the burger and if you want a side and drink, just add $$ to that. At Red Robin you can get a drink and regular or sweet potato fries and a drink for $12 or less. I dont know, the price for what I got was not great. Kind of disappointed.<//review>< Rate>

<rate>3</rate><pics>None< /pics><Text>Very spacious, staff was friendly but they are really going to have to step it up in the food department , especially for downtown Visalia you need to be better than mediocre ....For the price I expect a bit better ...Messed up our appetizer order, no worries....i had a chicken salad that was on par with Jack in the Box, She had a California Chicken that was Very good but the generic frozen fries offset that....

Step it up a bit to make it downtown, no wait staff it's just a walk up subway with a Bar</Text></record>

<review>In February, I lost my father unexpectedly and I had no clue where to begin to prepare a funeral. The Long Beach VA provided me with a booklet of mortuaries to call.  I called so many and it seemed like no one had capacity. I called McKenzie Mortuary and received a return call from the owner, Ken that eased my heart.

Ken was very kind and understanding. He understood my father was a Army Veteran who passed at the VA hospital and how important it was to have him receive a dignified service.  Ken sat down with me to create a wonderful Veterans package. He connected my family with Pastor Brown and the most amazing video creator Dave. Dave's slide show of my dad's life was AMAZING and it made my family remember all the good times with dad and cry tears of joy.

I am thankful for the wonderful staff at McKenzie's mortuary. And for Ken taking time to return my call and allowing my father to have the most beautiful funeral services. Thank you.< /review>< Pics>

I lost my 42 year old husband to COVID in January. Everything happened quickly and it was extremely traumatic. During this time, McKenzie Mortuary Services took care of every detail with kindness and care. Kenneth and his staff are warm and professional. During the hardest moment of my life, McKenzie treated me like family. I cannot thank them enough.<//Text>

Ken,

Our Family joins me in thanks to you and your staff at McKenzie Mortuary for the extraordinary thoughtful, personal and professional services rendered to us as you handled the Memorial and Determent Services for our Beloved Husband, Dad and Granddad.  You remembered the little things that could have easily been forgotten or overlooked by our Family.  You handled them with sincere compassion.  We will confidentially recommend McKenzie should the opportunity arise in our sphere of contacts in the future.

With gratitude,
Pearlie< /text>

My family and i used McKenzie's services for my father's funeral back in the beginning of the month of May. They were truly helpful in all aspects of the arrangements that were needed to be made. They made the transition very easy and stress free when having to coordinate my fathers funeral. We were truly grateful for what they did for my family & my father. Bonnie was an absolute angel and we are truly grateful for her & her support. I would definitely recommend using the services that they provide. Thank you guys so much from the Alvarez-Ruiz family.< /Text>

Despite it being a holiday evening, I was put in direct contact with Derrick of McKenzie Mortuary rather than a recording or an answering service. Derrick was kind, patient, and far from pushy while explaining the necessary steps to proceed. The entire process was eased by the professional and compassionate staff who were always responsive to my phone calls. Weeks after the arrangements were settled, McKenzie staff even checked in on my well being.
In summary, McKenzie Mortuary was efficient, professional, and compassionate. I would not hesitate to recommend or use them again in the future.</Review></record></dataset><record>

McKenzie has assisted with many passings within my family. My husband, my son, my aunt, my uncle. Every time they have been considerate and understanding of my pain. It’s hard enough dealing with family death, then to deal with arrangements is difficult at best. McKenzie will get you through it efficiently, effectively and as economically as possible. I highly recommend them.<//review>

The staff at McKenzie Mortuary was very helpful and supportive in my time of need. I explained to them what I wanted and there was no effort to sell things I didn't want.  Afterwards, they have followed up with calls to check on how I was doing and offered grief support information to help in dealing with the loss.  I feel comfortable in recommending McKenzie to others who have lost a loved one or are planning ahead.< /text>

Due to the outstanding service my family received as family members (aunt, mom, dad) passed this past January I was devastated.. My 32 year old son passed away from Covid-19 I called McKenzie Mortuary.  Kenneth and his staff were so compassionate at a time when the pandemic was stretching mortuaries throughout Southern California. They put their personal needs aside to focus on my needs in dealing with the death of my son. They were patient with me when necessary and kept me informed about his cremation and once his cremains were ready to come home. They attended to every request & detail I had.

If that wasn't enough on my sons birthday I received the most thoughtful message from McKenzie Mortuary regarding my son.

I can not say enough wonderful things about McKenzie Mortuary! I highly recommend them.<//review>

I recently asked my friends from McKenzie Mortuary to help our family prepare for my mom's funeral. I feel like I can call them my friends because we've used their services twice before, once for my dad and once for my brother and they've always done an exceptional job.

Derrick King, the Director, explained everything to us so there was never any doubt about what to expect. He made sure all options were presented and took his time so that there was never any misunderstanding.

Because my dad was a veteran, my mom and dad were both buried together in April 2021 at the Riverside National Cemetery . Derrick made sure that this took place and I know this took a little more work on his part.

We were able to witness the flag ceremony and the 21 gun salute which made it a very special day for all of us.

Again, McKenzie Mortuary, thank you for helping us during this very difficult time and for recently contacting us to see how we were doing.< /Review>

I actually left the mortuary with a smile, knowing that my husband would be laid to rest with great care. My husband deserved the best and we were fortunate to find McKenzie Mortuary.

10/10 service, came here a couple months ago when my mother passed away and Kenneth made my experience absolutely wonderful. He made us laugh, cry, and smile in our time of need and was very kind and through when talking about the arrangements. The cremation process was fairly quick, took about a month to get my mother but wouldn’t want to have it any other way. Kenneth also told us about the prices and didn’t try to upsale us. After everything was over they even contacted me asking if I was okay and if I needed anything. Very kind and pleasant people and would definitely come here again if I needed the service. Thank you guys ❤️</review>

My son died unexpectedly in November.  We live in Wisconsin and had to travel out to California for him.  Ken & his entire staff were amazing though this tragic, heart wrenching experience.  We first requested a simple viewing and then changed to a service, which they were able to accommodate within 16 hours, even with a Zoom component.  The care, empathy, and flexibility they provided was incredible during the hardest time of our life.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who is in the horrible place of needing this service.  They were a light during a very dark time.< /Text>

<Text>This mortuary has handled both of my grandmothers’ remains. When my maternal grandmother passed, there was no plan in place. My mom was no longer alive so it was my responsibility to figure it out. They could not have been kinder or more patient. With the loss of my dad’s mom this last February during the pandemic, my dad called many places, and none were prepared to accommodate us. I told him I was sure that Mackenzie could help him. Sure enough Ken, the owner, personally supported my family during a stressful time. We received follow up calls and first class service.< /Text>< name>

Ken McKenzie has been an absolute Godsent to our family. He has helped us survive our most difficult times in our lives. He recently once again helped us with our heartbreaking loss of my sister to Covid.
He was compassionate, reasonable, overwhelmingly helpful and so loving, we felt like we were being taken care of by family.
We will always be thankful for you and your staff for all your help and kindness.<//Text>

At the time of my father's passing another funeral home was available to pick him up. The other funeral home was not a good match for my family I reached out to Mc Kenzie's Mortuary  and the director took care of everything for me. They went and picked up my father from the other mortuary,  they treated him with kindness and respect. They returned phone calls in a timely manner. And they absolutely affordable.
No one tries to upsell you on any of their services they listen to your wants and needs and they deliver I cannot say enough good about the director and his staff.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>First, I am truly sorry you need to read this review, my condolences.

When I needed help as my mom was placed on hospice care due to cancer, I could not find anyone.  I called several places but due to Covid, everyone was full and over capacity.  I called McKenzie on recommendation of a social worker.  He listened and was compassionate.  He took the bare minimum of information from me then told me to do something important.  I thought he was going to ask for a deposit or payment.  He told me to go take care of my family.  He understood the gravity of the moment and had compassion upon me.

As my mom passed, they came with dignity and respect for her and took care of her.  I spoke to Ken as we finished arrangements in person and told him about not getting a flag for my father who recently passed.  My dad was a veteran and my sister got his flag upon my mom's passing.   Ken told me to show him the paperwork and he got me a flag.  He did it.  It was folded in the proper fashion and he handed it to me.  As a veteran myself, the flag has special meaning to us both.  I shed tears that were held back for over 3 years.

They continue to txt every npw and then to ask how I am doing and if there is any assistance they can provided even a few months later.

I highly recommend McKenzie Mortuary services  for their service, their compassion and above and beyond "humaness".  Thank you to the entire team.<//text>< pictures>

Sadly my mother passed away at the end of last year on NYE.  It happened very suddenly and it was hard to find a mortuary to get her before midnight on NYE.  McKenzie Mortuary Services to the rescue. They were able to get my mom before another scheduled pickup which was a blessing given our circumstances.
From Night 1, Ken (the owner), had been super thoughtful, caring, respectful, and an all around great person.  He met with us personally to go over all of the arrangements. We were prepared to bargain prices and had a good laugh about a Golden Girls episode in the lobby before our meeting. The McKenzie prices were very affordable. I honestly expected to pay 2-3xs more based on our experience at All Souls for my grandma in 2019.  We were pleased and agreed to everything. Ken made the entire experience easier given the nature of his business.  You can tell that he truly cares and has been pulling long days since the Covid peak.
Because of Covid we had strict rules to follow for the amount of people allowed at any given time during the viewing.  Ken’s people helped with everything along the way. My SIL provided photos and songs and their media person put together a great slideshow. They also filmed live and provided a Zoom link so friends and family could watch the mass service from home. All of our friends and family said the Zoom service was done well. They had different camera angles and the sound quality was really good- especially when my niece sang. The entire viewing process went smoothly and it seemed like fate that our mom ended up here. We couldn’t have been more pleased with how things turned out and how well everything went given how much busier Ken and his team have gotten.< /Text>

Ken was awesome. Made us feel comfortable through the process. He explained everything from A-Z. Staff was always nice and professional. I recommended this place to everyone. Very decent prices. If this had the option of 10 stars, we would definitely give them a 10. Thank you Ken for your humor, your professionalism, and above all your humbleness. Thank you to your staff for making us feel comfortable throughout it all. XO< /review>

<Text>Words simply cannot express how appreciative I am of Ken McKenzie and his staff. My father passed away while at sea on a cruise. He left and returned port in California and he was from Texas. My Aunt contacted Ken as she had used him previously. Ken could not have been more gracious to help our family in our unique set of circumstances. He and his staff went above and beyond. They were not the funeral home who was going to be doing the services, as I had one in Texas lined-up. Ken and his staff did every single thing they could to make sure that my father was not only taken care of appropriately, but they had everything lined-up so that as soon as my father returned to port he was returned home immediately. There were a lot of things that had to be done just right and put into place in order not to delay things. They are experienced, work hard for the family, and they did all of that while bringing an enormous comfort to us. I knew they had the best of intentions for my father. They were in constant contact with me every step of the way. Ken had the answers to every question that I didn't know yet I would have. Ken and his staff could not have been better. I am 100% convinced that I would not have received the same service and compassion from anyone else – and likely never again. I highly recommend McKenzie Mortuary Services.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dd31bd4a0c7c6d:0x70e699956f6ae1c1< /gmapID></record>

We lost our youngest son on July 18, 2018.  With our minds trying to understand this sudden loss, we were numb with the thought of having to bury him or even deal with all of the planning process.    McKenzie Mortuary  was referred to us by a close family friend who had previously used their services.  Ken and his staff were so kind and understanding and helped take care of everything we needed.  From the moment we first entered their doors they made us feel comfortable and completely confident that our beloved Wesley would be taken care of with love and kindness.  They made this very painful process go smoothly and they were always available for anything we needed.  I would highly recommend McKenzie Mortuary to anyone and have since given their information to several people.< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>No stars is what is deserved. The older woman in charge is rude and impatient during the services. Makes rude remarks and is rude about how she dismisses you.The room is stuffy and small, no ventilation inside chapel. If you have a loved one that was loved by many this is definitely not the place for the services. In fact, don’t use this place at all, theyre unprofessional and have no sympathy for the emotions going around. Don’t let them disrespect your loved one like that, they deserve better.< /Text></record>

I was very impressed with Ken and his staff . This is a great place at the worst time. After my father was there for his viewing and cremation we have since had all of our family who we have lost sent to this mortuary. Hats off to Ken and his staff.<//review>

Place seems nice, but very small. This place would be great if was a little bit bigger. With everybody emotions high, it makes it hard to breath. Plus it gets really hot inside.< /Text>

My sister just passed and they are the only ones that offered viewing and creation with urn for Tamar my sister so we can say goodbye our way to her. Accidental death is hard for a family.
After going to more than one place finding a place to offer everything else we need us a blessing.</Review>

We paid for a cremation package and they didn't even start the cremation until the night before his service!!  Even though we had his body released to them a WEEK before hand! They almost didn't have it done because apparently the staff didn't have the correct paperwork filled out, so they called us the DAY BEFORE his service saying they didn't have the correct documents to follow thru with his cremation! We were all so stressed out about it! We are not even sure how they ended up getting it done!?! Is it really my father in laws ashes in the urn?? Then, during the service, they had to keep changing the microphone batteries WHILE PEOPLE WERE TALKING. There was NO ONE helping us out during the service to make sure things went smoothly, my husband had to do all of that ON HIS OWN while also trying to mourn his father at the same time. UNBELIEVABLE!  Then, the music that my brother in law worked hard to put together DIDN'T EVEN PLAY during the picture slide show when it was supposed to.  The Priest we paid for that they hired was a bit weird & kept getting his facts wrong about my father in law! (So embarrassing!), AND the place was just too damn small and HOT!!!  Too many things went wrong with these people and my family really deserves some of their money back for all of this!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with their services. It has been almost a month in 5 days yet can't get the remains of a loved one. Then when you call the place, they keep saying they will return the call because they are busy. Where's the compassion in that? It's sad that we already lost a loved one and even more sad that i can't seem to get an answer about the remains!<//Review>< pictures>

Ken said he'd be at the services , never showed his face, told our family he'll have a brand new bronze casket, it was chipped and denyed and it was rose color for a male. Promised a limo which made family late to mass because driver was sick.  Poor quality of service sure took the cash payment with a smile. Do not recommend.</review>

<Text>I’m more of a used bookstore guy, but for a store that stocks exclusively new books this is one of the best I’ve ever visited. The selection is well curated and it’s easy to browse and discover new things.

I feel like I could easily go there and find a book I’d like to read within a few minutes. The only problem is you might buy a lot more than you originally intended!

It’ll be nice when the bar/cafe inside reopens.<//Text></record>

The best bookstore in the Los Angeles area I've been to! The displays are so thoughtful, like the handwritten blurbs/recommendation cards and bestselling shelves. Their selection of books has all the popular titles and many local and indie ones as well. The genuine care that this shop puts into selling books makes me want to visit Vroman's every week.</Text>

This is definitely Pasadena‘s best book store, and I love to try to support them when I can. But their Covid changes are very restrictive and they force you to enter from the back of the store. I feel sorry for them because they are probably losing a lot of foot traffic. They also make it nearly impossible to find the actual exit of the store. I appreciate their efforts to take care of us, but this seems quite overkill.<//Text>

First time going to Vroman's and it was magical the second I walked through the door. There is so much to see and so many nooks to venture into, I  didn't know where to look first. The staff was beyond amazing, they helped me find a book I wanted, but I  couldn't remember the title. I  described the few things I did remember and they found the book right away.  I know there's no such thing as a perfect day,  but visiting the store was simply amazing. I didn't get to see EVERYTHING, so we are going back again soon.  Love, love, love this store.< /Review>

<text>Vroman's is much more than a bookstore.  You never know what you will find there, but it will always be good. I go in to browse often because I know I'll come out with something satisfying. It might just be the perfect card for an occasion or a book I forget that I meant to read. Their gift selection is always beautiful and interesting, too. At holiday times our whole family shops there, joining a crowd as joyful as we are.</text></record>

<review>A Wonderland of Books and Gifts! This place is so much more than a bookstore. It’s a gift shop, a stationary shop, they have signings and speakers (or will have again, post-pandemic I’m sure). During the pandemic they have offered curb side pickup which I have used several times. I can’t wait to visit inside again.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c3680468043b:0x9085cc0a2f1ed3d1</Gmap_id></record>

Amazing independent book store in the arts district Pasadena. Normally, amazing book readings, children events, and a wine bar. Great selection, and amazing atmosphere. Delivery and gift cards currently available during covid crisis. Highly recommend!<//Review>

They are being very careful about how many people they let inside due the pandemic, for which I am personally very grateful. Very clean and organized in all areas. Fantastic and unique selection of books, gifts, cards and toys. Awesome, friendly and helpful staff. I've always loved Vroman's but it seems even better now. 😊<//Text>

Great friendly staff. Large selection of books. This time my partner bought three books and I bought all their Hunchback of Notredame trading cards from 1994. They have a barrel with other show cards as well.</text>

Nice bookstore, and great selection of literally any book, genre or bookstore gifts. Unfortunately it’s very pricey here, and gifts, while so nice and envy worthy, are so ridiculously priced that it cannot be justified. It’s much better to buy directly from the maker! I’m a big advocate for supporting local, as we all should. This kind of place makes you wish you had all the money in the world, and while that’s a nice thought, it isn’t the most important thing.

Support small, independent bookshops. Used bookstores.<//Text>

I always have such a great experience coming to Vromans! Obviously because of the books, but they also have tons of trinkets to buy as well! Great place to come if you want to find a cool gift for a birthday :)</Text>

<Text>Vroman's is taking COVID seriously!
As a customer I find this very comforting because they can only continue to do their jobs as much as I am able to remain an alive customer (& visa versa).
Friendly clerks can always; look up your inquiries & check you out w/o even needing to step a foot in the door!
Also, the park & pickup went seamlessly.< /Text>< username>

They have the most amazing selection of books as well as lots of luxury home decor and luxury personal items.They even have stationary greeting cards decorative napkins etc. The children's book section is absolutely amazing and beautiful. They have lectures and even have a coffee shop. You couldn't ask for anything more! We drive 50 minutes just to go to this place and make a day out of it.</review></record>

<Text>VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED ON THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILL. (Lack of)

I rushed from work to make it to Vroman's Before their closing time, which was 6 o'clock this Friday night. I had to buy a Birthday gift from their stationary department. A Mont Blanc Pen to be exact.

I made it by 5:58 2 minutes shy of their closing time thinking I would be able to get in. Needless to find out the doors were prematurely locked before 6 o'clock.

As I knocked through the glass door, as I am staring at a sign right infront of me saying 6 o'clock is closing time, as I point my iPhone through the glass door, that reads 5:58.

2 ladies behind the cash register are counting the cash behind the register. I knock on the door saying it's before 6 o'clock (2 minutes, I know its not much, but still they shouldn't lock the doors before 6 if that is what the sign says)

One lady in her late fifties/ealrly sixties with long brown hair and glasses approached the door and said we are closed talking behind the door. I showed her my iPhone screen saying its not 6 pm yet, and I need 1 minute to buy a pen.

She said sorry, I can't help you we close at 6. I showed her the time, clearly not 6 o'clock yet, and she said her time says different on the watch. Really? Your time on your wrist watch or on the wall may be ahead a few minutes, you may want to fix that as the time on the iPhone is more accurate.

She wouldn't care less that they had closed the store sooner than what they had shown/listed on the door. she nodded her head saying sorry, try back next week as we are extending our hours to a later time and that she would share the time issue with management. Really? Are you stupid or what? You see the time on the iPhone as I showed you, and your iPhone (if you have an iPhone or any phone reads the same)

I did not rush through traffic to make it before your closing time, for you to tell me to come back next Friday with extended hours, when you should be open until 6pm.

I was getting ready to buy a Mont Blanc Pen from their stationary department, as I have purchased several from the past, and have spent at least $5000 dollars on Mont Blanc pens at the store.

They say support your neighborhood book store, but not with this kind of lack of empathy and laziness and lies, when they list they will close at 6 pm and they close sooner without a care, and a cold stare/look.

There are many many other places I can spend my money, and I will no longer support you and your business. Just few months ago I purchased a limited Edition Disney Mont Blanc Pen set for almost $1000. This will be my last time. (see photos)

You really need to have people that care to be there, want to work there, and some sense of logic and common sense. If the phone screen is showing that the time is 5:58 and the closing time says is 6 pm. GUESS WHAT? CLOSING TIME IS 6 not 5:55, 5:56, 5:57, 5:58, or even 5:59 etc...

SO SO DISAPPOINTED as I had been a customer for over 20 years. Keep hiring employees at this low level caliber who don't give a single C R A P, then you are not going to last much longer, as I can easily shop at AMAZON.<//Text>< resp>

< Review>
I really believe that majority of the people here do not like their jobs, I know that COVID-19 has everyone frazzled and I typically don't really review spots. I went to grab a book for a friend that was stuck in traffic (and we thought hey let's support a local business). I was greeted with a "we close in 10 minutes". Awesome I already have a book on hold I just want to pay for it. I'm then informing the employee that I've never been here before, I got shuffled around and interacted with 6 different people only one was pleasant. I understand it's a long day but I wholeheartedly believe if I was white these interactions would not have been so nonchalant as if I was inconveniencing them. I should've saved my time and spent my money on Amazon. Do better.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I have been going here for years; I love the place. It's one of the only independent bookstores in the area these days for good reason. The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable, with great recommendations.

For those wondering, they have taken prudent COVID-19 measures (mask requirement, enforcing social distancing, sanitizer, one way in and out, etc.) The entrance is in the back exclusively during altered operation and there is often a line to get in (but it moves fast!) Definitely check this place out of you are looking for a new read. The cafe has some pretty tasty treats as well, and a well-stocked newsstand right next door.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Really cool bookstore! They have different sections easily laid out and TONS of cool knick-knack/gift shop type items.

Edit: taking one star off for horrible parking! It's always full.<//review>

Vroman's does the 'old-school' thing.
Their inventory is remarkable.
Their service is remarkable.
They 'hire in their own likeness.'
They are seriously experts. Go. See.</text>

<review>To begin with, I'm a bit envious of those who own comic book stores.  Regardless of how very little I know about running one and what I imagine would be hard work keeping one afloat anyway, I still applaud those who do.  From what I've seen, those who have a shop of their own tend to enjoy it.  (At least it appears as such.)</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I loved my first trip to Vroman’s Bookstore! It has a great vibe! I loved how the children’s room has toys for kids to play with! My son enjoyed playing with their car set and blocks. The displays were all very cool.  The only thing I didn’t love were the prices. Definitely on the high side. We enjoyed a treat in the delightful cafe.  I’d come back again for sure!<//text>

<Text>Every time I visit Vroman's is a fantastic experience. Having a local, independent bookstore so close to where I live is a luxury I am so grateful for.

The staff is always helpful, regardless my questions, and I frequently find someone with lots of deep recommendations for the types of literature I might be interested in. I could easily come here once a week and never tire of visiting or run out of things to discover.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Love this place. They look small from the exterior but in the interior you find that you’ve gone done the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland. The caverns and corners of this palace make you dream of things in a land far far away. There is an extensive selection, in both international and local categories. Bargain books and expensive rare ones. There are two stories of places to adventure in. A large magazine selection outside the shop as well. All in all a place I’d like to spend 6 hours in. The cafe attached is good, but I like the openness of a cafe within a bookstore and that’s what this place lacks.</review>

Vroman is amazing bookstore. You smell fresh brewing coffee when you walk in the store. This is a   2 story building. Many selections from stationaries, party goods, pens, cards, they also have a book signing area. How cool is that. You can easily spent couple hours in here. Staff are very helpful.<//Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>I made my second visit to 1894 today at about the same time as last week: the result was like the difference between night and day. Yes the main Bartender was  someone different, Barry.  And i'm thinking that this is why the adherence to good service was so much better than last week.
To be fair at 12-ish it was pretty slow and there was no sudden influx of about 15 customers as there was last week. I  would say that you can look at this two ways: one...people were turned off with the bad or inept service last week or two: business was geared to arrive later today based on any number of factors.
In any event: Barry's service was on point and contributed greatly to a pleasant early afternoon visit.
I ordered:
a flight of Chardonnay: both oaked and unoaked
an order of flavored popcorn
a 3 cheese plate of Brie, Lavender cheddar and smoked gouda
Mixed Nuts as in last week
glass of Pinot Noir
The Chard selections are interesting but the San Simeon from Monterey County was Oaky, fruity with earthy notes and the winner as far as i am concerned. The flight selection is interesting: going from non-oaked (grassy, light, notes of apple though w/o too much body), "lightly' oaked (more interesting than the non oak as the chard grape in my book blossoms in oak casks adding deep tones of pepper, citrus and even melon) and heavily oaked (robust, cherries and pecan tones).
The Cheese plate is iffy as the cheeses were variable in quality and taste with the Brie winning the horse race after i asked Marcus to mildly nuke it for 8 seconds.  Cold Brie is w/o taste. Room temp or heated Brie is much better.The plate also comes with tasty olives and gigantic capers. The crackers served were average though i would have preferred bread. And where is the spread as in mustard?
The Nuts as in last week are a bargain at 5 bucks and feature the good stuff: macadamia, pecans, walnuts plus)
All-in-all a much better visit than last week due to the positivism and personality of Barry and chill personality of Marcus. But the food selections are an issue as is the plating/presentation on the several that i have ordered particularly the cheese plate.
I did have a chance to speak to the GM, Bentley about  wine, food, She is a positive person who seems like someone who is looking to improve amd open to suggestions.
Since this place is inside Vroman's and next door to the Laemmle Movie theater, i will definitely be back.

Independent book store, with newsstand and stationary supplies and gifts sections; that has been in business well over 100 years.  No more need be said.<//Review>

I pre-ordered a signed copy of Trust by Pete Buttigieg back in Oct. When weeks went by with nothing I tried calling many times to check on it and no one ever answered. Finally I got someone very nice on the phone that told me they have been basically over selling copies. The issue is that no one bothered to contact me in a timely fashion to tell me that. Extremely disappointing especially considering I pre-ordered a signed edition that is not available anymore. Will not recommend ordering from them.< /Review>

<Text>I love Vromans. They always have an amazing  inventory of books, the staff are super helpful, and they do free gift wrapping! They have a good selection of gift items too- from feminist swag to space and travel themed tchotchkes, to games, and more. When I went during the week of Dec 12, 2020, they were doing a great job with Covid precautions- ensuring everyone was wearing masks, providing masks if you needed one, and limiting the number of customers in the store. My only complaint is that recently a friend of mine who is disabled and has mobility challenges asked for an accommodation with regard to his exit route out of the store, and they were not only very rude to him, but denied his request. He had to exit our a door that was FAR from where he entered, causing a difficult and laborious journey back to his car. :( Please be more compassionate, Vromans!< /Text><Date>1608186068514</Date><Rating>4</Rating>< username>

<Review>If you're a booklover, you should definitely visit Vroman's to explore and take in its history.  If you aren't, the store is still worth checking out if you happen to be in the neighborhood and have some downtime.  It's a neat place.<//Review>< Pictures>

Vroman's Newstand is indeed still open! Though the stand has been reduced to a smaller but manageable left-side area, they still have their unmatched selection of news/magazine selections.

If you don't see the newspaper/magazine you're looking for at first glance, then do ask -  it's possibly hidden beneath other publications and not fanned out due to space restrictions. I was able to find everything I was looking for, including an obscure science mag that probably has a readership of a dozen people. Their staff are incredibly knowledgeable and will instantly know what you're looking for! (I mean, I've never ever had a book question these guys can't answer. Vroman's book peeps are amazing. They're superhuman!).

Thanks to Vroman's for the stand. It's just priceless to still be able to get paper copies of the Times, LA Times, etc.

COVID safety note: I am very careful and have not ventured into any commercial establishments through this whole pandemic. I do however feel safe going to the Vroman's Newstand as it's fully outdoors, and you can even stand in the sun, no less. If you're concerned about the safety of staff/yourself, I think you can feel pretty good about visiting the stand.<//review>

<text>GREAT Vromans. Wonderful upstairs area has a space for book readings/ signings. Also upstairs is a gift shop with a fine selection of locally made greeting cards and little gifts (candles, small bags etc). Downstairs is a cute little cafe. All the employees are very helpful and knowledgeable of the store. There’s also ample parking not only directly in back but in paid parking lots near by because it’s right in Colorado.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Date>

<text>OK, I'm a bookstore fiend, and this bookstore is tied for first place in its category (tied for second in the US, but it's impossible for modern book stores full of new wares to compete with the old labyrinth living history you're-an-archaeologist anachronism ones).  Whenever we go visit my mother-in-law everybody wants to go to Vroman's before they want to go out to eat or go see any entertainment or even go to museums or anything else.  I never want to leave.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMm0gooRVMA4YsKfPgFbCueRbZl3QrwthScCG1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOETfSFX3JG0-g1LaEBCR-eL6GxPQ1digw7gknG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtb1cRaNAWVSV_5BnwWS2BD4pThJv4lotmiu7f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

Vroman's NEVER disappoints!  I love supporting my not-so-local bookstore.  I purchased three magazines, two boxes of Christmas cards and two Christmas books (Christmas items were 50% off), three children's books, a young adult novel, and a graphic novel.  I didn't have enough time to peruse the stationery section today--next visit!  Vroman's has excellent author events, gifts, cards, games, toys, AND books!  I'm a frequent customer.  Be sure to stop at the little cafe that's attached to the store.  Nothing like a hot (or cold) coffee or tea to go with your good read:-)< /text>

Vroman’s may be the greatest independent bookstore in Cali. They set the bar really, really high. In addition to an amazing selection of books and unique gifts the place is always spotlessly clean, well organized, serene, and welcoming. The staff is super friendly, professional and helpful but you’re always given your space to browse and read without having them hover over you. After making a purchase you can hang out at the attached JONES cafe (really great coffee and vibe) and now there’s even a wine bar, which I’ve not tried yet. Can’t say enough great things about this place. Come check them out!< /text>

<Review>Very local bookstore, warm and cozy! They have some Pasadena’s souvenir items such as a magnet and a sticker. First floor has a cashier next to a back door, stationary, travel items are behind the cashier. There is a seating area on second floor, which is look like a church inside. Kids books are on this floor too. Coffee shop is easy to access on the first floor right next to the main entrance. Christmas items are 50 percent discount now on the second floor.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>The best not-really-a-book-store in LA. They not only cater to book lovers but also to lovers of book lovers. A 'stuff' shop first and foremost and the best place to get fountain pens or notebooks in greater Los Angeles. They recently opened a bar inside and have a lovely little coffee shop too. If I lived nearby I would probably forego rent and just wait for opening and live inside.

Their book selection is wonderful, but there is no chance at used books here. However, there are plenty of true bookstores nearby with fewer knickknacks and more dusty tomes.

It's not hard to convince someone to spend an hour at Vroman's. It earns it's tenuous spot at five stars but holds steady for now. My hope is they pull from Powell's and work out a used book strategy in order to become the mega-store they so rightly deserve to be.</Review><Time>1582588325342< /Time>< user_id>

The staff is amazingly helpful and they go above and beyond to find what you're looking for, but if they don't have it they'll try and order it for you. If you're patient they will do the search...on top of that they have a cafe with delicious food!! Prices are reasonable for the state we live in!😃🤣< /review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Date>1578459608275</Date><review>Patronizing this independent bookstore is a great way to champion local business. Of the two locations, this one is far superior. Vroman's facilitates the best kind of book-buying experience that encourages lingering and browsing: tremendous selection (and they will always offer to order anything they don't stock); excellent children's section; wide array of cookbooks.It's also a great place for small gifts and notions, plus they often host events and readings.<//review>< Rate>

<Text>Vroman's! Great Location on Colorado Blvd...carries many books and read.. to every genre and taste. Sip a coffee as you read...walk the extensive isles and or make your way upstairs and browse....collection of interesting items. Service is great...staff takes time to help you search what your looking for....they sell fine tip Pens. Family friendly and nice place last of its kind. Look for book recommendations and top reading authors top 20. Fiction or Non-Fiction....they have it all....smile...reading is still possible as you hold a great paper back book.</Text><userid>112965551498325922031</userid>< username>

Always a wonderful experience just to be in Vroman's. They're letting few people in at a time and are being rigorous about social distancing, and other preventative measures.</text>

Vroman's is wonderful - as always!  The cafe is greatly lacking in the bonhomie which it used to have. Not friendly at all.  Hadn't been for a visit for a few months, and the changes are NOT an improvement.< /review>

Came for a Friday night reading. Lovely atmosphere, great selection. Rude checkout experience as I purchased a poetry collection. I asked about the teacher discount and was summarily brushed off. Off putting. Training issue?< /review>

Awesome place. Wonderful atmosphere. I’ve finally found a book that I was looking for a long time. Kids were also happy to spend time choosing a book to eat. I didn't see the wine bar there but it sounds as a great idea, I would love to read a book with a glass of Pinot Noir wine there. Will definitely visit this store again.</review>

I love their selection of books. They seem to be one of the last books stores around. There is always a good fresh smell of coffee when I go. Their front has an area that helps you look for books or points you in the direction.

They have even held books for me. It's quite handy.

Everyone's nice and helpful.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Ironic that a bookstore is the subject of a love story but if you can make it out from behind your computer screen this is the bookstore to visit. It has a coffee bar, all the books and magazines you could desire and gift wrapping upstairs. It's so cool  Stars shop there "inconspicuous" and "incognito" to have a little rub off on them. Great parking in the back off Walnut, a one-way street. Come from Lake like a Local.< /Text>< Pics>

Large selection of books about birds, the most important criteria for a bookstore. A+. Also they have a coffee shop, wine bar, and are close to public transit busses and not far from the train. Overall a winner.</Text>

Great place to find some unique literary materials and gifts for family/friends who appreciate both books as well as stationary. I do look forward to the wine bar that they will be opening and I must admit this is a bibliophile's dream hang out spot. If in Pasadena, this is a must to visit! Now, yes you can find some books on Amazon at a cheaper price, but there are some books that are not worth the wait over the mail. Parking for me has been across the street just for a little bit of exercise.< /text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><Review>I don’t think I could love a bookstore more. Just walking in surrounded by books and beauty makes my day brighter. I buy gifts for non-readers too! There’s so many unique items. I love the travel section. And the dog and cat accessories! My favorite is the employee reviews of books. I am adult with no kids but I spend a lot of time in the kids section for gifts and just to see what’s going on in that world. Ive also attended many events! From the night the Deathly Hallows was released to a reading from Diana Gabaldon. And I remember the early 90s a signing by Anne Rice! I hope this independent bookstore is always a Pasadena treasure< /Review>< user>

Really cool selection of gifts and books. Great for last minute gift ideas. Bought a wax stamp here which was unique. Love that they have a massive fountain pen section. There are two floors and they also gift wrap. Staff are all friendly. Parking in the back. Also surrounded by many other shops to visit.< /text>

I have been going to this store for years. One of my greatest pleasures is just browsing their book displays and all the fun stuff they have on both floors, from soaps to Christmas decorations to fine stationery. Recently, I wanted something unusual: a book for a person who is still learning English. The salesperson, Joy, after listening carefully to my needs, took me to 2 separate places in the store to find books on learning English and on writing. After she left me, she was helping another person with a completely different esoteric question -- I think on female jazz artists. Wow.  In addition, they now have a Jones Coffee cafe on the premises, and some dudes playing on a beat-up piano outside. It's a fine bookstore!</text>

<Review>While hanging out in Pasadena, just resting a bit before continuing the trip towards East, I came across this book shop, in search for some good reading to come with me.
I really liked this shop, it has a superb and complete selection. I spend two hours exploring their offers, and I had to force myself out in order not to "waste" too much time.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2c3680468043b:0x9085cc0a2f1ed3d1< /gmap_id><Time>1555459788659</Time>< Name>

This is one of the oldest bookstore around that I know of. Considering its size it's impressively well stocked. I rarely have issues finding a book here (unless it's so obscure that no book store would carry it). It's always clean, tidy, and organized. The atmosphere is always quite comfortable. And the cafe is top notch. It isn't the largest book store but it's always a good one to visit.<//text>

Always a great choice! They have it all.... An inclusive assortment of books but also... A newsstand, a coffee shop, and a wine bar is now being incorporated into this amazing mix! In addition many selections that could be used as gifts such as beautiful note paper, specialty hand cream or a beautiful frame, a purse, or when you just can't put your finger on it for that special person, a gift card! Let's not forget they have an amazing children's selection upstairs as well. You could peruse for hours!< /text>

Legend amongst bookstores dating back to the late 19th century I kid u not. Comprehensive collection, 2 floors, impressive greeting card collection, helpful staff, great outdoor news&magazine "stand"...easy parking which amazingly is free of charge on Colorado Blvd...so u walk a block! Big deal! Many interesting items besides their awesome collection of books. They also have book signings and other weekly events. A powerful contribution to Pasadena and worth a drive to this important destination</text>

<Review>Great independent bookstore. Very unique. A very wide variety of items, including pens, journals, cards, children focused area, bags, socks, and more. Large variety of books on almost any topic one can think of. I would give it 5 stars easily, but costs are higher here and I understand why. I bought a pen that I know I could have found cheaper, but I wanted to support the store. I still love Amazon and their pricing so 4 stars is the best that I can do.</Review>< pics>

<Review>This library has nothing exceptional. They do offer lots of books and other stuffs. Prices are high but it is hard to sell books nowadays. If you live in Pasadena, shop your books there instead Barnes and Nobles but if you are a tourist like me, there is no need to stop by.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I went there a lot years ago and really liked it. However, when I went there last time I bought some children's books and the attitude was so thick from the staff you could slice it with a knife. My wife asked if she could get a teacher discount and it was like we asked for something outrageous. Then they proceeded to put an All Sales Final stamp on my receipt which I only noticed once we got home. Not sure why it was there. Anyway, I generally like to support local businesses, particularly bookstores, but their differentiators are their browsing experience and staff help. They get points for large children's choices and the decor. However, given the convenience of Amazon's ebooks and delivery, or barnes and noble's better service (they're consistently nice and helpful), I hate to say I'll not be going to Vroman's anymore. The service was just too snooty and weird.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c3680468043b:0x9085cc0a2f1ed3d1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This place is great! A lot of history here, and not just in the books. Seriously, read up on the history of this place. It's just as interesting as the bookstore. The staff was all very helpful and didn't seem to be bothered by all the questions, as it was my first visit. They have a large assortment of books here, as well as a coffee shop if you'd like to settle in and read the book you just purchased. I'd recommend this place to any avid book reader who would like to buy a book and help maintain such a great business.</Review>

Ironic that a bookstore is the subject of a love story but if you can make it out from behind your computer screen this is the bookstore to visit. It has a coffee bar, all the books and magazines you could desire and gift wrapping upstairs.< /Text>

There are not many outstanding bookstores left that not only have a wide range of books, and a boutique of unique gifts but also a coffee shop with great vibes. I always want to support this neighborhood gem even though I use Amazon a lot — lets not cause our wonderful bookstores to go extinct . Plus it’s really fun gift shopping there.<//text>

Vrooman's is the type of bookstore that when you walk in, you may be reminded of Barnes & Nobles; honestly, I wouldn't blame you if the thought crossed your mind, given the unexpected largeness of the shop, expansive book selection, and of course the classic coffee bar and wine bar (Yes, they have a wine bar!). Independent bookstores usually can't do what Vrooman's does.

The truth is: those other big bookstore chains wish they could be more like Vrooman's. At other stores, their largeness feels empty. Meanwhile at Vrooman's, it's a thrilling hunt for some quirky find -- a book or perhaps from one of the themed displays littered across the store. Book browsers (and gift givers), welcome to your new home of discovery. Whether you want to wander into a new genre without a clue (my usual choice for a day at Vrooman's) or seek out a newly released novel, they will likely have what you want or a worthy recommended staff pick. I like to explore the twists and turns of the aisles just to read the recommendations! Despite how popular and busy Vrooman's always is, the aisles never feel crowded. Make sure you check upstairs, especially the always changing art (available for purchase) in the staircase, and return later for an author talk or book fair; many talks are hosted up here or in the courtyard.

As for their coffee and wine bar, I've yet to order from either. If it's anything like the rest of Vrooman's, they probably serve "the good stuff," and I really hope so, because anything less would be a big let down. Unlike the rest of Vrooman's, the coffee shop has always been too crowded for me. All I can say is good luck getting a seat. Maybe the best time to visit is right at opening. Wine at nine, anyone?<//Text>

I honestly can't count how many times I've been to this bookstore or how many times I've bought something from them. Their staff have always been helpful, and they have great book reviews written on their shelves by staff and customer alike.

It's an honest-to-god brick and mortar bookstore, and feels like one, and it matters.</text>

not too many brick and mortar bookstores left with amazon in play.  nice bookstore with a good selection of books  and toys with easy parking in the back.  there is a pretty broad kids area with toys and other items available for kids to play with and quite a number of book events and signings.< /Text>

<text>If you don't know who bought Book Soup in WeHo, you do now: Vroman's. Pasadena's very own oldest indie bookstore, over 150 years old.
They offer educators a wee discount on materials used in classrooms. Their book signing series is outstanding. And the staff... Absurdly brilliant. From the knowledgeable Fountain pen Heads who know their inks and bobs down pat, to the  informative staff - I mean, I don't know when I last had a conversation that was worthy of a college level course on 13th century middle East philosophy and the humanities. On HIS lunch break. Who does that???? Unless they genuinely love where they work, n'est-ce-pas? Hail to the Holy Grale that is Vroman's. Order a cup of Joe from Jones Coffee Roasters while there. And if you need to find a gift, look no further. Their pet-related miscellany, their stationery, and their mugs! Too perfectly curated. L'Chaim!<//text>< Time>

<Text>I come here for gifts for others or order books that are not sold in the store. But I hate the new ordering that you need to give them a credit card number in order to order the book over the phone or in store meaning they will charge you first before shipping it.<//Text>< rating>

<Review>Yes Vromans is locally owned historic 1st class bookstore. It is also mecca for fountain pens & fine stationary.

I shop for gifts here. Among the bookshelves are themed gift items; travel with the travel books, kitchen accessories with cookbooks, yoga with yoga books. Toy selection, puzzles & games, among the best in the region. Five stars and four dollar signs.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The hands down, thumbs up best bookstore in Pasadena, maybe the San Gabriel Valley, and top 5 in the Los Angeles metro area.  There is a nice coffee shop in front.  Out on the street there is a good news stand.  Upstairs there is an excellent kids section and a separate area for cards and gifts.  I like the staff recommendations.  The cards that the staff write usually inspire me to pick up a book.  Very large fiction section.  Great atmosphere.  If you like bookish things, Vromans is certainly worth your time.</text>

I love that there are still some bookstores in existence and I love that this one is still around. The people are all generally friendly, they have a massive selection of books, and the vibe just feels right. They do book signings and various other community types of things that add to the allure. If you want to go back in time a little and read the introduction to a book in your hands before purchasing, then I'd say to head here.<//Text>

Great children's and gifts section.  But the selection advertised downstairs seen overly  mystified in one area of spiritualism almost to the point of it being a temple of shine sort.< /text>

Love this store. One of the last bastions for book lovers (apart from Barnes and Nobles and some old bookstores, its literally a ghost town now). I don't know what their magic is, but the last time I visited the store was brimming with people. I hope they can keep it going and keep the art of readings alive for many years to come.< /text>

They are definitely not a Barnes & Noble so you will not find discounts, & other retail items can be pricey. Service,  like everywhere else is hit & miss, but there are folks who are happy to help & it's nice to support a local business.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<text>A Pasadena institution. Helpful staff. Always willing to special order if they don't carry the book. Lots of cool gifts for any age. And if you can't wait until you get home to read your book, you can hang out in their little patio area or in the cafe.< /text>< rating>

Great bookstore! SO much selection. Too much sometimes:) Parking is ample. Their cafe is nice too but too small, always crowded, and most of the time there's nowhere to sit.< /Text>

This independent bookseller has been around for over a hundred years now. The redesign over the last decade was a welcomed addition, but now we're at a point where it feels like home. This is a great place to not only pick up books but meet authors. It seems like they are there almost daily. From independent presses to mainstream novels, this is a great spot to read a book, pick up a new one, and chat with the most knowledgeable staff in town.</Review>

<Review>One of the best bookstore's left. They always have great events with authors. They offer good events for kids. Active monthly calendar to let you know about their events. Helpful staff, and staff recommendations through the store. Books are reasonably priced. Small cafe attached. Plenty of parking in the back.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Date>1478553522662< /Date><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

<username>Linda Brumfield</username>< Review>
I ordered two different books at the Hastings Ranch Store two weeks ago. I never received a phone call. After one week,  I went to the store. They had one of the books. I waited another week and went back to the store for the second book. They did not have it. When I became persistent, they called the store in Pasadena. The store in Pasadena said they did not have it but they had a shipment that had not been opened. I was persistent again and another person called again to the Pasadena store, and they found 2 copies of the book. I drove to the Pasadena store, and THEY could not find it. After being persistent again and waiting for a long time, and talking to a manager, THEY FOUND TWO COPIES OF THE BOOK! I could have ordered it on Amazon and received it the next day and for allot cheaper! It’s unfortunate that Vromans is the only bookstore in town! I will never go there again. They didn’t offer to compensate me for my hardship, with a coupon or discount or something! Do not order anything from Vromans! Order from Amazon. After all of that, today I got a call from Hastings Ranch to tell me that my book was there! Go figure...</Review>

Big legacy bookstore has survived Amazon with helpful staff, good selection and author visits. Coffee shop and newsstand out front add to the experience. Worth the drive to Colorado Blvd on Pasadena. Free parking in lot in back. Elevator and stairs inside for access to departments on 2nd floor such as Children's books.< /Text>

This place has been in business for over 100 years for a reason - they are good at their craft. I always find what I need, and more often than not I pick-up stuff that catches my eye. Tonight I came to pick-up a book that I preordered. Staff is pleasant and efficient, and their birthday card selection is pretty good too.</text>

<Review>Vroman's Bookstore is a gem, especially since  this kind of bookstore is getting harder and harder to find. Here you will find a wide- ranging selection of books, knowledgeable booksellers and the literary vibe that goes with those things. You should seek out Vroman's to experience what a real bookstore is all about.<//Review>< rating>

Vroman's books is a wonderful and rare independently owned bookstore that has been a Pasadena institution pretty much forever. I buy from them as often as possible and nearly always find what I'm looking for when I drop in. They also have a really nice children's section on the 2nd floor. Make sure you check it out.<//review>

While wife was at an appt. I strolled through the early morning streets of Pasadena and ended up at Vroman's.  This was one of the best books stores I have every visited.  In addition to countless books, there was a unreal amount of other Christmas gift is as in there....no joke...TONS OF STUFF to choose from.  Wonderful stop to pick up some goods, for those who prefer reading over looking at your Facebook page for half the day.< /Text>

Vroman's books is a wonderful and rare independently owned bookstore that has been a Pasadena institution pretty much forever. I buy from them as often as possible and nearly always find what I'm looking for when I drop in. They also have a really nice children's section on the 2nd floor. Make sure you check it out.<//review>

< review>
I ordered two different books at the Hastings Ranch Store two weeks ago. I never received a phone call. After one week,  I went to the store. They had one of the books. I waited another week and went back to the store for the second book. They did not have it. When I became persistent, they called the store in Pasadena. The store in Pasadena said they did not have it but they had a shipment that had not been opened. I was persistent again and another person called again to the Pasadena store, and they found 2 copies of the book. I drove to the Pasadena store, and THEY could not find it. After being persistent again and waiting for a long time, and talking to a manager, THEY FOUND TWO COPIES OF THE BOOK! I could have ordered it on Amazon and received it the next day and for allot cheaper! It’s unfortunate that Vromans is the only bookstore in town! I will never go there again. They didn’t offer to compensate me for my hardship, with a coupon or discount or something! Do not order anything from Vromans! Order from Amazon. After all of that, today I got a call from Hastings Ranch to tell me that my book was there! Go figure...<//review>

< Review>
I recently read a book available at Vroman's  bookstore. No Ordinary Season written by James Jacobs is a great teen novel.   I love the characters  in his book,  it shows the trials students go through in high school and the way they sometimes get resolved. No Ordinary Season takes place in a small town in Indiana and revolves around the cross country team and their dedication to the coach and the sport. It would be a great sunmer read.<//Review>

This has got to be one of the best bookstores around. In a era of dying local book retailers, Vroman’s maintains their relevance by selling top books and gifts and has been a staple of Downtown Pasadena for decades.< /Review>

One of the best bookstore's left. They always have great events with authors. They offer good events for kids. Active monthly calendar to let you know about their events. Helpful staff, and staff recommendations through the store. Books are reasonably priced. Small cafe attached. Plenty of parking in the back.<//Text>

Vroman's is absolutely amazing and very well worth visiting...
Surprisingly large inside they have a section to cover every possible interest. The huge selection of books is almost overwhelming and yet always satisfying. The store is always neatly organized and extremely clean. The employees are always very friendly and ready to answer questions.
This isn't just a bookstore though, they also have an entire section of high quality writing utensils, planners/organisers, desktop trinkets and other small items that can be paired with a book to make the perfect gift.
This is the kind of store you can literally get lost in for a couple hours or more.< /review>

<review>This independent bookseller has been around for over a hundred years now. The redesign over the last decade was a welcomed addition, but now we're at a point where it feels like home. This is a great place to not only pick up books but meet authors. It seems like they are there almost daily. From independent presses to mainstream novels, this is a great spot to read a book, pick up a new one, and chat with the most knowledgeable staff in town.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>Big legacy bookstore has survived Amazon with helpful staff, good selection and author visits. Coffee shop and newsstand out front add to the experience. Worth the drive to Colorado Blvd on Pasadena. Free parking in lot in back. Elevator and stairs inside for access to departments on 2nd floor such as Children's books.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This is a lovely bookstore but incredibly smaller than it's sister store in downtown Pasadena. I came here with my brother and looked around a bit. It's not the huge bookstore we use to get lost in, but it's very nice. I would call ahead to see if your item is in stock. The only drawback is the parking lot. This shopping plaza has an awful parking lot so keep alert.< /Review>

Support your local independent bookstores! Shop Local! Vroman's has a fantastic selection of books, and all sorts of gift items as well. Stop in for a cup of coffee and browse a bit. I love the attentive, knowledgeable staff here, as well.< /Review>

Huge selection of books, pens and other gifts. Restrooms are upstairs. Checkout your items before going to the adjoining cafe. I love their recommendation tabs for browsing and discovering great new books.<//review>

The best book store ever. In addition to quality books, you will find unique items, such as cards, gift wrap and special gifts. The coffee tastes amazing, and the customer service is amazing.<//text>

I hope it survives the amazon machines. It's the quintessential bookstore and Pasadena would be a lesser place without it. It was very busy when I was there though it was Christmas< /Text>

Although they don't price match, this place is a gem on Colorado. The attention to detail they put in and all the decorations make this place amazing. They have weekly readers, and themes and classes and the list can go on and on. Just visit it! You won't regret it. Huge selection, friendly staff! Loser Hillary will be there in December. Get your questions ready!< /review>

We had a great visit here to see some local authors talk about their books. This is a huge bookstore which first opened in 1896. If you can't find anything here, I don't know where to recommend!<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Every Saturday morning Vroman's has a young kids reading session from 10 AM to 11 AM. If you have kids between 2.5 and 5.5 yrs of age, you should definitely bring them. It's a wonderful experience and it's a great way to encourage your young ones to love reading.

They also pass out helium balloons afterwards ... and who doesn't love balloons?<//Text>< user>

Just a wonderful old school, indpedent bookstore. It has everything you can imagine in it and has a lot of space on two floors. They have a little cafe and an excellent assortment of gift style items which is something I always appreciate in a bookstore.< /Text>

<review>Very cool bookstore in Pasadena.  It is the oldest and largest independent bookstore in Southern California and has been a Pasadena staple since 1894, I believe.  There are lots of nooks and crannies for you to squirrel yourself away and review a book you're thinking about buying and they have a grand selection, some available with employee book reviews to help you with your decision.  There is also a coffee shop indoors and they carry many decor and personal use items which make great gifts for your loved ones or even yourself.  I can get lost in this store for hours just "window shopping", lol.</review>< Pictures>

So nice to see a fully fledged book store still hanging around! I live a few blocks away so I have a pact with myself: I'm only allowed to go once a month, and only allowed to buy what I can carry home. They've got a great selection here, and also host frequent events.< /review>

Vroman's is my favorite bookstore of all time. Great selection, friendly and helpful staff, wonderful events, and upstairs is a terrific kids' section, greeting cards, and more. They'll even gift-wrap your purchases for free, which has been handy a number of times!<//text>

Whether you're a first-time visitor to Pasadena or a lifelong resident, Vroman's embodies the essence of locally-grown independent business. Truly a Pasadena institution, they are extremely well-stocked, with a friendly and knowledgeable staff to help find whatever you're looking for. Highly recommended.</review>

Good customer service the display and arrangement of books and other super fun things are pleasing to the eye  :) .  The stationary is pricey but I guess everything can't be under $10.00 and I say this in a kind way. Overall I'm glad they are a part of my neighborhood, good parking area. So make a day of it and browse around but give yourself plenty of time, you'll forget anything else on your agenda.<//Text>< Pics>

There are two locations: In Pasadena location there is a smallish coffee bar attached to store. It is right next door to the Laemmle movie house. The Hastings Ranch store is much smaller in same strip mall as Whole Foods. There is a Starbucks just across from it. Excellent service at both locations.</review>< Pics>

Beautiful bookstore, I wish there were more of these around. Hopefully this one doesn't go any time soon! I really like the personalized mini book recommendations provided by the staff throughout the store!

Pros: many, many books, from kids to adults. Stationary and other knickknacks as well. The employees REALLY know their books, and are excited/passionate about discussing them with you.
Cons: not much.

Tip: Parking can be difficult, approach from the Oak Knoll side to get in to the parking lot easily.<//text>

Love this historic book store! Great children's section, focused sections on art/ feminism/American immigrants and resistance. Fun, sometimes kitchy gifts that are a treat to look at. Quiet, and no one will bother you.  Lots of literary gifts, and an awesome selection of recommendations by the staff - who are super friendly. A bit too much trendy, national brand soap/lotion/candle stock for sale on the second floor for an Indy book shop, but you gotta make money somehow, right? Definitely stop in. Then go to Amara Cafe and Chocolate for the best churros and award winning chocolate con leche.< /Text>

Awesome bookstore with helpful and friendly staff. What makes this store stand out is the fountain pen department, which has a wide variety of writing instruments, inks, and stationary. The upstairs also has a home goods/home made section of goods, which a variety of items including jewelery, soaps, candles.<//review>

They'll even gift-wrap your purchases for free, which has been handy a number of times!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Vroman's is a great place to get lost in. If you are a book reader this is the place to be. Good customer service the display and arrangement of books and other super fun things are pleasing to the eye  :) .  The stationary is pricey but I guess everything can't be under $10.00 and I say this in a kind way. Overall I'm glad they are a part of my neighborhood, good parking area. So make a day of it and browse around but give yourself plenty of time, you'll forget anything else on your agenda.< /text>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Browns is proof positive that bookstores are still relevant in the days of digital consumption. With two floors of perfectly organised books and a smattering of knickknacks, you will immediately be put in the mood to browse and discover.

The children's book section is where my family always ends up and both of my kids learned to read from books are Vroman's. It's also a great environment to hang out to read to your kids.

Vroman's also has many special events, from book signings to weekly story time. They're always really well organized and engaging.

The newest attraction for me is the addition of The Next Chapter coffee shop, which is operated by the folks who run Jones Coffee in Pasadena. It's a nice atmosphere with a good amount of outdoor seating to enjoy the great coffee and the occasional pastry.

Vroman's isn't just a neighborhood bookstore, it's a destination. With everything it offers and all of the local restaurants nearby, you could find yourself spending the entire day, and you'd be better for it.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>My favorite place in Pasadena. I admit it, I sometimes read ebooks now and I feel guilty about it. Because there is nothing better than a real book. Which means, there is also nothing better than walking through Vroman's and look at all the books. The staff is always friendly. They don't care how long you stay and leave you alone to search - but help you at once, when you ask and look for something special. The additional coffee place makes it even better - you can start to read your book at once, when you bought it :)</review>< Pics>

Excellent bookstore but full price on all things. Vroman's is an institution in Pasadena. They do not buy old books. There are two locations: In Pasadena location there is a smallish coffee bar attached to store. It is right next door to the Laemmle movie house. The Hastings Ranch store is much smaller in same strip mall as Whole Foods. There is a Starbucks just across from it. Excellent service at both locations.<//review>

The reader is very kind and patient with the children at storytime,  which is held Wednesday and Saturday mornings. He reads for a full hour and the books get more challenging as he goes so that it can appeal to a wide range of children. Afterward each child is given a free balloon. The children's section upstairs is simply wonderful with areas to play at and a comprehensive selection of books and toys. The café is wonderful also! Very kind and helpful staff. A family friendly place.< /review>

Good selection of books; great selection of gifts. Friendly staff as well. However, this may not be the best place that you can spend a whole afternoon just reading inside.< /review>

The one and only mom and pop bookstore I know of that's large, this is a fantastic place for hanging out and browsing.  They even have a very nice pen counter with a nice selection.<//text>

Vromans is amazing...I've been a patron for more than 20 years! Author events with the fine caliber of authors are superb as well as the events they have been presenting for children for years! It is rare that I visit Vromans for less than 90 minutes!< /Text>

< review>
One of the last independent bookstore's remaining. Incredible  authors come to Vroman's, read from their novels, sign their books for fans and answer questions from fans. I had the opportunity to see Chuck Palahniuk and participate in the hijinks and fun atmosphere he created. He signed one of my favorite books. Events like this occur frequently and all you need to do is sign up for their newsletter to find out when.

Vroman's selection is huge and if they don't have your book, they'll order it for you.

Amazon is great for lots of things but not for independent bookstores. Support your local bookstores and if you're in the Los Angeles area, Vroman's is a must experience.<//review>

I mourned the day Open Vroman's Bookstore abandoned its River North locale for greener pastures. What used to be just down the street, was now  by car. A tote in hand and some cash, I decided to make the pilgrimage on foot. Not much has changed cosmetically in the newer space-- similar exposed loft interiors with all the same furniture. It definitely feels more warehouse than homey bookstore. I do miss all the windows from their former location. Back then, it seemed they couldn't cram enough books onto their shelves. Here, it seemed all of them had room to breathe. New reads and revs, fiction, poetry,<//Text>

One of the best bookstores in SoCal. It's not Powell's but it's a reader's dream in Pasadena. They often have author signings. There's coffee on premises, too. It's a beautiful space. Lots of staff recommendations, if that's your thing. It's a Pasadena treasure.< /Review>

What's not to love about Vroman's? A shining beacon in an otherwise suffering segment, Vroman's selection, staff, and events are all top notch. You can browse, seek help from knowledgeable persons, read, use WiFi, and shop for unusual gifts in this standout bookseller. If you're a homeschooler, you can even ask for a discount. Visit, often.< /Text>

< review>
I grew up on Vroman's Book Store, my grandmother worked their for 30+ Years and I remember getting to go through the stacks to find her when ever we came in, and she was not in sight out front.  This is where I developed my strong love of reading and why I still like paper over digital for reading.  I have the digital but certain books not only need to be read, but felt (texture of the page) scent of the paper, and sound turning the page makes can not be replaced.  It all helps to increase the imagination as I troll through the authors world.  I can sometimes even remember the scent of some of the women's perfume when I think of some of the times I was their. Of course I also have my special books grandma always brought home for me when I need the next one in a Science fiction series that I could not do with out. ( Usually Star Trek ).  The area has changed the block has changed the look of the street has changed.

Vroman's Book Store quality and customer service has not.  Keep it up guys and enjoy the Holiday's.

I went to exchange the earrings my sister gave me for my birthday and they told me it’s against state law for them to except a return of earrings they were very snotty and very condescending I’ve never liked Vromans  to be honest with you because I always thought it was filled with snotty people and I don’t understand why people run their in droves like they’re giving away things -Amazon Amazon Amazon !!!!that’s why nobody wants to support local business.You were treated by the way you look as far as Romans customer service goes and I don’t have blond hair and blue eyes</review>

Vromans is a must for book lovers. Its warm atmosphere and helpful staff make it a visit worth taking at any day. The kids section has a varied selection of books and toys and offers a space for little ones to play. Jones Coffee is serves coffee roasted locally and it's delicious. A great spot to meet before walking around the bookstore or catching a movie nextdoor.<//Text>

I love that they have a give back program in our community as well as being tied into events. I went today with Elouise to pick out some books for her and the Children's book staff was both knowledgeable and helpful. Elouise was able to ask questions about a few of the authors she was reading and look at her options. It was a negotiation to leave with only 2 books, but glad I know where to go for more books in a few of the series she's interested in.< /Text>

This is the spot for some very delicious, strong coffee in the mornings. The bar opens at 6:30 am, just in time to drop in from the gym and have a fresh cup of coffee, before starting the work day.< /Review>

Like a high-brow Barnes and Noble. In the best imaginable way.

COFFEE
B&N: "Starbucks"
Vroman's: Pasadena's excellent independent roaster, Jones'

BOOKS
B&N: Every bestseller, except the one you wanted
Vroman's: Every bestseller, plus beautifully curated employee picks and entire sections that would never make it into B&N

STUFF
B&N: Moleskin notebooks, cheap book lights
Vroman's: Tons of notebooks, gorgeous stationary, pens of all budgets, tons and tons of gifts for book and culture lovers, everything you could ever want -- please let me live there, please; just let me pitch a tent between fiction and philosophy -- I won't make much noise, I won't start any trouble, just give me a couple of cortados a day, I -- I know you close at 11 -- yes, I know it's 11:30, but -- okay, okay, I'm going -- don't -- don't threaten me with Kant's complete works -- I'm going! I'll be back! I'LL BE BAAAAAAACK!!!

Support your local bookstore! Vromans is an excellent store with a great history of public service, and great customer service too. We need to keep the traditional bookstore for our children to experience.</review>

Not sure what they're doing with their parking but the store is still lovely with options for kids, adults. Attended a batman writer signing and it was a lot of fun, a little poorly executed but still fun nonetheless.</Review>
