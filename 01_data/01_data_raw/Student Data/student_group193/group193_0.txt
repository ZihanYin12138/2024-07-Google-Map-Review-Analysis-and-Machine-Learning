< Review>
Can I give negative stars? Appalling and possibly criminal. It's tax day with only one employee helping customers. Despite the line of customers queued up inside the lobby, at 6 pm the employees, who would not so much as give their names, announced that nobody else would be served and slammed the rolling steel doors shut over the counter. Some folks had been patiently waiting for over an hour, not only to be denied service but also the opportunity to go go to another branch. My blood is boiling.<//Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I have been going to this PO about once every week or 2. They are The Absolute Worst when it comes to wearing masks. For those of us who are at higher risk of Covid, this is not only impolite, it's dangerous. These photos were taken about 2 weeks apart. When I told the 2 postal workers today that I was distressed by their mask-less-ness, they started screaming the they were wearing masks (yeah...around their necks!) and threw my receipt on the floor. I hope they don't mess with my packages!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaTEeoRwQl-v-WOG9YyFFWmd6lCNmZ3sQiW7tw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2ba5cf321abd3:0x58774cda5e011074</gmap_id></record>

If I could give it 0 I would, they can’t be bothered, through email or phone. They haven’t delivered a package that according to tracking has been at the post office for 5 days. Also, I use the informed delivery, saw my stimulus check in the mail due last week, and that’s the only piece of mail I didn’t receive. Called, emailed, nothing. I had packages that never showed up since I moved here in November, packages left in the basket my neighbor’s bike, and Christmas cards that still haven’t shown up. The common denominator is this post office. They must just take what they want because the only thing they actually deliver is bills. Everything I can do to avoid shipping through this post office, I’ll do from now on.if you value your gifts and purchases and checks, DO NOT LET THEM GO THROUGH THIS POST OFFICE</Review>

Just moved into the area. I'm going to have to get a post office box because of the inept post office in Mar Vista. I ordered a bedspread in early April. Tracking said delay in your area. After a week I received a notice that it was being delivered on April 21st. I stayed home ALL day,  with my door open so that I could hear any knocking on my screen. It said it would be delivered by 7. By 5 I checked further, signed up for another tracking with USPS. It said attempted delivery at 11:45 am. It said "no secure place to leave package". I go downstairs and inside my mailbox is the notice to pick up at the post office or have redelivered. On the form, she had time to write a 26 digit number but not the reason, or actually deliver to my very secure hands? It seems like they just get the tracking #, fill out the form and just deliver that with the mail. Don't even bother delivery of the package. We have cameras on the mail box, so the unsecured location is ridiculous. So if you live in Mar Vista and are expecting a package you have to sit next to your mailbox like Gollum from Lord of the Rings to receive your property. They don't do steps or their job. She ignored the form requesting redelivery, the tracker expired after the post office ignored repeated online requests for redelivery. The company I purchased my bedspread from just issued a replacement. Because, after walking 2 miles to pick up my package that I requested redelivery TWICE they could not find my package. The last person to have my package was my carrier. I believe all the stories here about packages being stolen may be true. I'm contacting the postmaster tomorrow. I think it's time for some drug testing and under cover monitoring at the Mar Vista Post Office. Mail tampering and theft is a felony. #marvistapostoffice #theft #inefficient #postmastergeneral #investigate</text>

You have had my medicine bouncing around for over a week. I was advised yesterday to call this morning. I accidentally called too early, and apparently tipped them off so they have decided to stop answering the phones until the trucks leave. I know, I know. You are extra busy. But I am sick and need my medicine, so I guess we all have problems. Second star because the clerk I spoke with yesterday was friendly and tried to help me.< /review>

This post office is completely horrible. The staff are lazy, chatting with each other rather than addressing customers. When they do interact with customers, they seem annoyed that they have to manage complaints or even work. When a problem was not remedied I left and in my way out, I received a sarcastic “good luck” from one of the employees. No one monitored mask wearing and lines were disorganized with no mandate to remain apart. I sincerely cannot wait until the post office cannot compete with private carriers and is forced to close.< /text>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Dropped off a package on December 10th & its now January 21st. The system hasn’t updated since December 11th. I called to ask what’s going on & the lady put me on hold & didn’t realize she forgot to press the hold button & heard their entire conversation about information unrelated to anything I asked, they had a completely normal conversation as if I wasn’t waiting on the phone. I hung up & called a 2nd time & put on hold again because she couldn’t understand what I was saying, I’m so upset. This has NEVER happened to me. I still have no real information about my package or what’s going on.< /text>

This is unbelievable. I came to send some mail. The place inside was completely empty. NOT even one person was working. Finally after 15 min of waiting someone showed up saying that there is no one will help you because we are at lunch. Come back in 30 min. Personally I never had this kind of customer experience</Review>

I called this office, desperate to get the package delivered (as it was already 2 days late). Even though it was already 7.30pm, they called the postman and he went out of his way to deliver the package anyway. He arrived at 8.30pm, way past his EOB, but I GOT IT. I am beyond thankful, these people are the real heroes without capes.< /Text>< Pics>

My sister was trying to send me a care package to a DEPLOYED LOCATION saying the address is invalid when I can pull up the address on their website saying it’s valid.

<Text>My drop off packages are being Stolen from this locAtion. I sell online and drop my stuff there. Not anymore.Two packages have gone missing in the last month and it’s only been new stuff. It’s as if they are pros at knowing which boxes contain the good stuff. My packages haven’t even been scanned. I am 100% sure it’s one of the employees because I hand my stuff to them. I am going to open an investigation and if possible, file charges against whoever is stealing my expensive packages. I am at a loss and have to refund customers thanks to whoever is doing this. You are going to pay I swear. My suggestion is obvious. Don’t even come here. There’s a burglar in disguise.< /Text>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><review>1st the 800 number--20 minutes going around an automated menu which couldn't give me a selection that was relevant to my issue and so just kept be going around,  No option to opt out and speak to a real person if necessary. So I called the local PO directly.  After getting disconnected (that may not have been their fault)--I'm asked to call back because the person answering the phone needed to identify just who could help me.
She was very courteous and made every effort to be professional but apparently didn't have the resources there  to assist.  So, I'm leaving work early to show up in person (my idea) and try to get this handled. There must be a better way!!!!!!!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>I actually live not here but in a timezone where most post offices were already closed when California's was still open. And I needed information that I couldn't find online so I just randomly picked a post office to call and after 4 failed attempts at various post offices I called this one. A guy picked up right away and helped me very courteously. So much so that I wanted to leave this glowing review. I doubt I'll ever go here physically but I've appreciated their service today. If the guy I spoke with, I wish I got his name, is an example of how their workers are, I'm sure it's a great place to send your mail. That's weird. Anyways.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Worst post office.  Artist threw my meds over my fence even after hearing the dogs behind the fence. The dogs tore my meds and possibly ate some as I couldn’t account for all of the quantity listed on bottle. Went to talk to supervisor and carrier admitted she tossed over my fence. Supervisor said too bad we are not responsible for damage. Unbelievable, that’s the service they give. Don’t care about you or if they poison your dogs.<//review>

This post office steal mail. Period. I have 2 open cases of theft originating at this branch that they are unwilling to look into with any kind of thoroughness. I understand they don’t like being accused of stealing but 2 of my last 4 packages went missing out of blue boxes and the post office parcel bin.

WARNING: if you are an artist or craftsman that does online sales, that prints your own labels ALWAYS GET A RECEIPT when you drop off mail. I have had mail stolen from the parcel bin at this post office and I’m fed up and won’t tolerate it any longer. My course of action is to use companies like FedEx and UPS that are driving the postal service out of business - but if you choose to continue to use this corrupt government organization ALWAYS GET A RECEIPT.

Others have been stolen from too - just look st other reviews. This isn’t an isolated incident. The employees at this branch are rude, defensive and frankly they are thieves and I will no longer use the post office in my neighborhood. ✌🏻</Text>

PEOPLE package your stuff at home!  Thank you Mar Vista Post Office!  You're my neighborhood mail spot, and I am grateful!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmap_id>

<Text>I'm not receiving my deliveries. I've had to go down there 3 times in 2 days, because their carrier keeps skipping my house. He puts attempted delivery, but never shows up. They won't hold their carriers accountable, or do anything about it.
When you complain the carriers hold your packages ransom.
I'm going to have to insist vendors ship with UPS or FedEx, until someone steps in and starts making these fools do their job.<//Text>< Pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I hate whenever I have to have any interaction with the post office. The carriers are unreliable and don't deliver our mail often. When it comes to package delivery, I have had packages go missing, been reported "delivered" when they were not, and been marked "unable to deliver" because no one was home to sign when I have been at home all day waiting.
There is a reason the USPS is failing and it's their lack of communication, unreliability, and poor customer service. They don't even admit to mistakes or make offers to correct situations. I get so frustrated when vendors opt to use USPS instead of UPS or FedEx. I will always opt for paperless bills and choose to use other delivery vendors because I cannot trust the post office to do their job.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>Literally told me that customer service was not there to help me and only had to do what they felt like. Told me that they were going out of their way in informing me of a possible solution after I asked them several times for solution options and didn't even help me all the way. They put me on hold for thirty minutes then told me to call the next morning and contact the manager.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
The lady who helped me was so rude and condescending. I asked a simple question- how much it would cost to ship my package. I gave her the address and she snapped at me that I need to write it on the package myself. This was after I explained that I hadn't written it on the package yet because I wanted to check the cost first. She was also rude to the three customers in front of me- one of which was a dad trying to be super nice and explain he was buying stamps for his young daughter to play pretend with. So sad. If she hates her job she should go elsewhere and not take her bad attitude out on customers.<//Review>

<review>We love our neighborhood, but we, too, are experiencing serious issues with getting our USPS mail delivered to us.

We've had problems with sending personal letters, greeting cards (which we confirmed didn't make it) and checks (that we had to cancel) from the outside boxes at the USPS-MV branch. We talked to them and they responded in a tone as if that was common knowledge that "yeah, those boxes get broken into frequently, you should never use those" (!).

We've had several packages stolen (they claim they were delivered and marked them as such, anyway) while we were home awaiting deliveries (no one ever knocks and we have no windows facing in a way that we could see them walking up to our door), as well as several incoming pay checks missing from our mail, with no evidence of a broken mailbox.

When it comes to deliveries, they often leave packages sitting anywhere from on the ground in the general area of our mailbox (close to the sidewalk/curb) to the other end of the property by the alleyway and several times they have literally thrown (!) packages up our one full flight of stairs. Last time it happened, I was only a couple of seconds away from the front door and I heard it happen, so I peeked out and the face of the lady "delivering" the package revealed that she was shocked to see me, as she was more or less running away from me. It looked as funny as it sounds...

We make sure to always have someone be home when a package is to be delivered, especially since we've had several packages gone missing, and we also closely follow tracking details (USPS tracking details are especially off at the MV branch, as they randomly seem to mark packages delivered before they even start their route and other times retrospectively at the end of the day), yet they have not even one single time knocked on our door.

At the post office, we've repeatedly talked to the post master and he basically says there's nothing he can or will do and that we should probably make sure anything important and especially all pay checks are sent to us insured and with tracking numbers added. We were shocked to hear him say that. My partner replied out loud what I was thinking too: "you're basically saying that to actually get your mail delivered, you have to pay extra and get tracking and insurance?". His response was to tell my partner that being sarcastic wasn't helping (!). Problem is he wasn't being sarcastic, there's nothing funny about any of it. Even if we wanted to do what he told us, we are both freelancers with varying people and companies sending us checks from places we don't always know (3rd parties are often involved), and therefore it is not a possibility for us.

Over the past two years, we've also done probably a dozen mail holds and we always make sure to add one extra day in case we're delayed coming home. Turns out every single time we've done a mail hold in the past at this local post office, they have delivered our mail anyway, including their own note to hold our mail (!). It doesn't matter if we do the hold request online or in person (as they suggested after our first few complaints).

The only exception was the last time when we did the option of picking up our mail in person and we came in a day early and they simply didn't have it, telling us it was because it was "probably out with the carrier" (!). When we went back the next day and finally got our mail, it contained another person's mail as well (unfortunately that's not unusual, not just previous residents', but neighbors' at other addresses) that looked very important and urgent and had been sitting in our hold for a week. We saw it before we left there and immediately informed them of that and they asked if we were really sure we didn't know this person? (!)... Thinking of all the possible letters of our own that we don't even know that we've been missing out on over the years makes me quite mad.

I'm not joking when I say we have considering moving because of the local post office.</review>< Pictures>

"Thelma" needs to find her Louise and lose her attitude. I called to ask a simple question that I was not clear about and she went off on me saying how I need to make sure that I ask her the right question because it's not her job to know what I need. Sadly, before I could hang up on her, she hung up on me.<//Review>

I dropped of 4 packages of my online sales in the drop off bin and 3 out of them was delivered without  any problem but 1 was lost in the "mail". but the tracking number never updated this signifized that the package never left the facility. THEY LOST IT OR STOLE IT FROM ME  !! LOST THE ITEM AND THE COST OF THE SHIPPING PLUS I REFUND THE MONEY TO THE BUYER

***PLEASE ONLINE SELLERS ALWAYS ASK FOR REICEIPT *** WHEN DROP OFF PACKAGE</Review>

I was extremely unimpressed with this Post Office. The line was insanely long and there were only two employees working the window. The ladies working the window were rude and unhelpful. When I asked a simple question, the lady answered with a huge attitude and sent me to the back of the line. I will never return to that post office again.<//review>

This post office used to be good in my eyes.  However, recently they haven't been able to deliver the postmail until after the postoffice closes.  I complained a couple of times and said i was going to write a review and the girl goes to me "REALLY?".  Like I had no right to complain or write a review.  Yes, it's my rightttttttttttt especially since you guys can't seem to hire enough people to deliver the mail on time.  Also, they jacked up the mail prices for sending out mail.  Gosh get it together.< /review>

I have never seen more unfriendly, unprofessional and rude post office clerks as this particular one. No wonder the post office is almost out of business. It's because their customer service is below zero. Whoever manages this particular branch must be replaced immediately. He/she has no idea what they are doing.< /text>

This is the worst post office I've ever been in. Rude and slow staff. Very inattentive to customers at the pick up window. USPS, if you want to remain in business then this is not the type of institution you should be running.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I love this neighborhood aquarium. It is a clean and well kept like an aquarium that sells fish . You can buy Koi, and other fresh water fish and supplies for your aquarium. I come to the store because of the cleanliness and knowledge of the proprietor. He said that he has been in the business for 30 years. The owner gave me some ideas on how to solve a problem that I am having with my bettas. I highly recommend this store for all your aquarium needs and supplies. The prices are reasonable too.<//Text><userid>113555126632220534134</userid>< Resp>

I talked to the guy I don’t know him if he is the owner or the worker. He explained to me every details how to set up the tank heater and kits for PH. While I’m talking to him he concerned about how you will build a healthy tank and not money matters I’m saying this because it’s my first time to having aquarium he advising me to stabilize my tank for a week and instead of buying 20 cichlids fish I need to get 3 to 4 if the fish survive that the time to add more fish. And he explain to me about the territory. Now instead of buying staff in Amazon I rather  to get to his store as a token for what he did to me.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Everything you need for your fish( if you have one) is here at this aquarium and if you don’t have a fish yet and/or the necessities to maintain a fish; at this place there are both... great selection of fish and for a great price.
They also had good customer service!<//text>

Suggested goldfish not beta for my outdoor pond. Also said the plants I had we're probably enough to oxygenate did not need to buy more so I'll seems honest not necessarily trying to sell something. The Goldfish are small non fancy 6 for a dollar.

Visible from the street with blue windows and fish painted on. Off-street parking only.</review><gmap_id>0x80c2da88b70d9a65:0x4ff79b60ae547edb<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

These guys are awesome.  I had to surrender three big tinfoil barbs.  They took them no questions. And was able to pick up some angel fish.  Thank you guys. Keep it up.< /Review>

As soon as you walk in you see the beautiful assorted peacocks in a very clean aquarium, all there fish are colorful, healthy, well maintained, clean, I could go on and on. the service there is great, prices are fair over all great place to buy your fish. Also have great deals on aquarium starter kits! I really recommend this store.</text>

Place is clean, and the fish seem really healthy of course there's always an occasional sick fish but rarely see any dead fish in the same tank like other stores. You'll find tetras, cichlids, parrot fish, mollies, platys, goldfish, gouramis, kois, arowanas, algea eaters and bettas. The tanks are set up nicely as well, clean. Theres a great selection of decorations, tank sets, and anything you need for your tank there.<//review>

Having your car towed is never fun! Especially at 330am on Saturday morning and this Tow Company is only open Mon-Fri? $408 cash only for Saturday pick up. It just didn't seem right and yr he cost was outrageous! We appreciated them for opening up on Saturday when they are supposed to be closed, but they sure were busy, had 2 other people there trying to get their cars too.  Strange. Hmmm?< /text>

Ok. Well I just spoke to the the girl who answered the phone I didn't catch her name. But she was ABSOLUTELY outstanding work her customer service and her ability to understand and empathize with the situation. The way that so many places andaro here lack customer service skills it was a real pleasure to deal with someone who actually appreciates their customers. Maybe it's because they realize, or she realizes that it's the customer's who in fact part their bills so to speak. That's how I've always viewed my customers and that's why I value each and every customer I have the pleasure of dealing with. So thank you so much for your help and exceptional customer service skills. If the tow goes there same I'll leave my review as is. For some reason I have much confidence that I'll be just as happy. Thanks again<//Text>

<review>My experience with this towing company wasn't great at all! IT WAS EPICALLY AWESOME!!! The driver got there in less than 20 minutes, pulled the car out of the garage (that was in an alley way), backed his way out of the alley and parked the car on the street in less than 10 minutes. And to top it off, it didn't cost me a limb to pay. David was awesome and my apologies, I didn't get the dispatcher's name, but he was awesome too. Thank you, you have no idea how much of a blessing you guys were for me this morning!!! If you need a tow, call these guys...you won't be dissappointed!!!!<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< userid>

This place LIES about if/when they got the call. 66 minutes I've been told to wait to then be lied to. And told another "20 minutes". They  lied again and just cancelled.

Aaa is 30 minutes, this dip wanted 88 minutes and turned it into a no show.< /Review><Date>1543493551652</Date>< Resp>

Found staff to be extremely unprofessional. While no one ever looks forward to retrieving their car after being towed, I expect the towing company to be professional and efficient at allowing me to pay the fee and retrieve vehicle.

In addition to being slow, manager should learn to keep his personal conversations out of earshot when customers are nearby.

Also, hours of operation stating 24 hours is misleading as they charge you random fees if you're trying to pick up before it's convenient for the owner.<//text>

This company is a joke.their driverdanny reyes is a thief ripping off people charging them more than they supposed to and forging signstures on receipts. And keeping some money for himself.i had him tow my car 30 feet at most.and he charge me 100 and lied to jis companu wrote a fake receipt for 60 and kepted 30 for him self.when confronted he lied like a rat and never returned my money. I will never ever call or recommend them to anyone for what to pip people off and be just like a rat and lied. Dont call them if you need tow service .i know i wont ever again.<//Review>

<Text>The're holding my personal belongings for a ransom >:(
I surrendered the vehicle and they keep asking me to bring in more paperwork from the DMV in order to get my belongings without paying a ransom fee. I've been there 4 times turned in all the paperwork they asked for and now they're saying I have to pay ransom regardless of doing everything they asked for.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>Worst service ever! The tow truck driver broke my bumper off and is saying that my vehicle was already like that. The company is refusing to pay for the repairs.

< Review>
They gave me the worst service
I understand it's your job to do what you got to do
But not to treat someone like they're stupid
They had a sign that they were "closed" when I called 10min before showing up (also saying the payment was 310)
They insisted I had to pay 450 when they had just picked up my car last night in the neighborhood I live in. saying I didn't pick my car up from their shop for two days
How are you going to tell me when I drove my car and when I didn't they were so rude the whole time
Who ever does business with them is just as bad< /Review>

A fun and welcoming studio for recreational choreography, and fitness dance classes.  the instructors are mostly fun and upbeat and lead great single classes.  This isn't too much of a technical learning studio, more of a place for people who love to dance to come and take classes where they can learn choreo to current songs in an hour.  There are lots of different hip hops as well as some west African/Latin fusion/burlesque style classes. Also plenty of fitness dance classes like Zumba and groove.<//Review>

You can find coil fish, other small fish, small birds and  reptiles. Supplies for dogs, cats, birds and of course fish and reptiles. There is a little bit of everything.<//Review>

This small lot has great stores and shops, the vendors are friendly and approachable, each vendor has a specialty, check out each one, I'm sure you will find what you are looking for!
Warning; Parking is limited, patience is a requirement. Best time to shop at the El Segundo Center is when the young people from the Learning Centers are in session.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

The office staff are these two nice, young girls and they are super sweet and understanding of any issues I have. The maintenance crew is pretty punctual and thorough. The apt building itself is a little on the old side which explains the 4 stars. But the entire staff and office coffee/candy are awesome!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Date>1590011358647<//Date><Review>These apartments are so close to the UCR campus that it makes it very convenient to commute back and forth from campus. The apartments themselves are in very good condition, new upgrades and changes have been made which has made my living experience here even better. The management staff has been so helpful in answering all questions and making sure all residents' conflicts and issues are solved. I'd like to especially thank Megna and Brooke for taking the time out of their busy schedule to help me resolve a conflict I was having. Student life is already busy but having helpful staff at the apartment complex has been a huge blessing!< /Review><Response>{'time': 1590171209682, 'text': "Doreen Palaha, we're so glad that we were able to go above and beyond your expectations! Our team strives to deliver an excellent experience, and are glad you found this to be the case during your visit. If you have further needs or questions, please reach out!"}<//Response>< gmapID>

I had a great experience talking to the assistant manager Megna. She helped me with the application process and she answered all my questions about the units. She gave me a tour of the place and even got to meet some of the residence. Very loving human beings, they go to UCR as well so it’s nice to see someone I’ll be going to school with. Overall, the only reason why I would give it a 4 and not a 5 is the area it’s in but don’t be fooled it’s amazing complex and these ladies are amazing to work with.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I DO NOT RECOMMEND. You pay way too much for what you are getting. They are constantly shutting off the water and take DAYS to bring it back on. In the past 3 months the water has been shut down at least 6+ times for fixes and yet the pipes continue bursting. How does that make sense🤷‍♀️. When I moved in I found rat and roach traps in the heater storage cabinet. There was an an infestation in the kitchen cabinets and many things did not function properly. I made the best of this situation but don’t let it be you. Now having said this, do as you wish with this information. Have a blessed day!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Don’t listen to the false positive reviews ( they’re being bribed with a Starbucks gift card 🙄). This place is disgusting and jumps at every opportunity to charge fees. Dead bees are were in the laundry room for TWO WEEKS before someone finally cleaned them. I moved in with dead bugs already hidden in the lights and kitchen corners. Forget about stepping on the balcony if you’re on the top floor. It feels like it’s going to collapse. There’s also no security whatsoever and there’s always strange people lurking about. Not a safe environment for a female college student.< /text>

I have lived here for two years and my experience here has been so awesome. This is a really nice place to live, the office employees are courteous and helpful and the apartments are clean and close to everything. The maintenance requests are taken care of within 48 hours and they always send you a survey about the maintenance service to make sure you are satisfied. I have signed another lease to live here for a third year because the apartment is so great. Campus Crossings has been a really great place for me to live at and the staff work really hard to be there for you. Thanks Campus Crossings!!<//Text>

I have recently just signed a lease to live here for the upcoming school year! The leasing office staff have been so helpful in dealing with all of my questions  (I ask a lot). Phone calls have always been quickly answered. Overall, everyone is very nice and welcoming, making this place feel like it will be a great new home. I also love the four events that happen every month.</Review>

<Text>Truly an amazing place to live and super safe area. The location might seem kinda off and not so good but in all honesty it’s safe from mornings to night time. The staff working are super nice and beyond helpful. For the price you’re paying for what ever unit you get your definitely getting more than you're paying for.

I definitely take back what I said from when I first moved in.

Don’t not move here. It truly seems amazing at first and convenient living close to campus but overall you’re gonna be dealing with things that make it not worth living here.

Flooding in my bathroom that took 3 weeks to fix and with me having to clean up the mess and management not caring.<//Text>< user_name>

I live in a two bedroom apartment here and the living room is a good size for one large couch as well as a small couch. Also, the living room can fit a small dinner table. The kitchen that my roommates and I have fit a refrigerator, a sink, dishwasher, and a gas oven/ stove. There are plenty of cabinets in the kitchen, all three of us are able to store and fit our own kitchen wear and food. the kitchen is connected to a hallway. the guest bathroom is a god size with tub and shower. The master bedroom is a good size that can fit two twin size beds. The closet is big too, but the sliding door can be hard to open. The master bed room's bathroom has the sink separated from the shower and toilet. the counter space is roomy. My only complaints about Campus Crossing is that there are few parking spaces in the front. Of course I have my own parking spot, but I prefer parking in the front. Also, the apartments are not closed off from the streets, so make sure that at night the front door apartment's are well secure and closed. I find the maintenance here pretty good, but that could be because this is my first apartment. Also, the apartment staff provide little events every month and they can range from free food to crafts to movie night. If you are a student at UCR, its pretty close to the school and easy walking distance. If you don't feel like walking there is a bus that can easily take you to the front of UCR.</text>

<Text>Lowest you'll pay for a huge and spacious apartment. Fantastic staff and really fun resident events! Maintenance always available to fix things up immediately.

This is my fourth year living here and every year seems to be getting better and better. The staff in the office is always so nice and so helpful. Brooke has always been there to help us whenever we need her plus she always plans the best community events, SHES THE BEST!! Whenever there’s an issue the staff is always so quick to fix it. The pool is really cool and at night it changes colors. The two laundry rooms are conveniently located on each half of the property. I’m always trying to get people to move in here. 5 stars easily.< /review>

<time>1536987197543</time><Rate>3</Rate><text>I didn’t give this place 5 stars for a couple reasons. Let’s start with good. Over all it was a good couple years to live at. The area in general isn’t the best but it’s not the worst and when it comes to the apartment, you make of it whatever you want. I was fortunate to have a fairly decent experience for the last few years. I recently moved out and i just wanted to say that the manager Brooke was the girl who got me to sign a lease and whatever and as the years went by I saw her being so loud with parties that felt like they were everyday and found it funny when I would get called about a noise complaint for taking heavy steps. Walking to my apartment i could see her walking around drunk with her friends or blasting music and people yelling. Couldn’t take her seriously ever, neither could my boyfriend. Secondly she was just kind of rude and not very helpful or showed good customer service skills. The only reason i stayed for so long was because of school and work but i finally graduated. Bugs became an issue sometimes but they do have the exterminator guy who comes i think once a week and the pool had homeless people in it sometimes but there’s homeless people everywhere. Maintenance was okay, sometimes really fast sometimes not so much. Over all not a great place but not the worst place. Close to UCR if you’re a student< /text>< pictures>

I can't recommend campus crossings apartments. Ever since we moved in we've had nonstop issues. The condition of the carpets are unacceptable. We're talking stains everywhere and unhygienic looking. We've had a roach problem since day one and have caught them in our utensil drawer and on the dining table. Dirty everything including the patio/balcony and kitchen. The power outlets are also low quality. Nearly all the outlets in the apartment lack grip so when you connect devices they come loose or fall out.

I've been issuing work orders since the beginning and maintenance only fix a few things and mark it all as completed. So I have to keep remaking work orders and everything takes forever for them.  I can't recommend these apartments. There are many apartments in the area and I unfortunately picked the bad one.

These are only some of the problems. Don't trust any reviews two sentences or less. I've uploaded proof so you can see for yourself. Yeah. That's a roach on our dining chair.

Update 2-5-2020:

The water shutoffs are no joke. At least a few times a month. They even have the audacity to charge us for fixing the carpet. It came pretty bad. Ontop of that the bathtub was peeling and they won't fix. The bathtub is starting to look really bad now.

Problems here just continue to get worse. Down the street you get more for less and includes utilites. They even wanted to up the rates to resign. I laughed after I got off the phone when they called to resign. Avoid Campus Crossings unless you like to gamble.

Final Update:

Well thankfully this is the last time I have to deal with Campus Crossings. Campus Crossings has to be one of the worst in the area. Brooke doesnt respond to most emails and calls. Its been mostly a bad experience. I cant recommend these apartments as I dont wish the same misfortune for another. These are only some of the issues. I havnt had the time to list and make maintenance orders for everything.

Ontop of that my roommate didnt clean out his stuff and the apartment took a part of my deposit. Thanks.</Review>

<review>Do not live here, it will be the worst mistake you'll ever make; they will charge you for absolutely everything!!! Many hidden fees, and costs, they also wait until last minute to inform you about charges, they wait until everything piles up to tell you about the charges. The five star ratings on here are fake, pay attention to what their ratings are on Apartment ratings and other platforms, don't be fooled and do not fall for the trap.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

There is a good maintanence team that always gets orders done when you put in a request. In addition, finding parking at least for me hasn’t been a problem which is always something that is important.<//Review>

Close to UCR. Convenient smart click site where you can pay rent , view your lease and request repair services at any time. tons of opportunities to earn a little extra cash with things like referrals and their rewards program. They host lots of different events throughout the year that give you opportunity to get to know other people living here and staff. Community pool and wash machines. Outdoor BBQ grills not fire pits.</Text>

this place and management are high quality. My apartment itself is very high quality and the patio is huge, my favorite part about it all since I'm into gardening my patio is practically a yard. Staff are a tremendous help when it comes to rent and other issues. maintenance seems to always be on top of things and problem a are usually fixed in a timely manner. Applying and moving in was a breeze thanks to the help of Brook, her thorough explanation of things made feel at ease since this is the first time on my own. I also really enjoy the fun special celebration and treats they have going on almost every week. Carlos really brightens the events up and is easy to talk to about issues. Only downside I can think of is rent is on the expensive side and the barbecues are abbot out dated and funky</text>

Unless you live upstairs, the place is a dump. Walls are hollow. The entire complex has a roach and spider problem. Most apartments I've been in have some sort of spider web spread going around. You could literally hear each footstep someone makes upstairs if you're on the first floor. They have a problem with water shutoffs every now and then or some sort of water leak. Other than that, management is good. All the girls in the office are really helpful at what they do and any requests that you make to get something fixed is done pretty quick. The maintenance guys are really respectful and good at their job. All this place needs is some sort of renovation.<//review>

<Review>This is my second year living here and believe me when I say that if you are a college student you DO NOT want to live here. On first impression the office staff and apartments seem really great, but they're just trying to suck you in. I've had various problems with the office on different issues and not once do they work with you. Even if you try to contact the corporate office they will not help you at all. Here's just two examples of major problems I've had with them:

Rent is due monthly by midnight on the 3rd. For this quarter our Financial Aid doesn't get disbursed to us until the 4th. My roommate and I (along with many other students) called the leasing office to express our concerns about the date and not being able to afford the late fee, but to my surprise the manager said that he could not waive the fee. What upsets me is that this is "STUDENT INSPIRED LIVING" and we apply with our financial aid as our source of income and they have a copy of our Quarterly aid amount, but won't work with us students for ONE day while we wait for our quarterly aid.

On a different occasion my roommate and I were trying to get out of our lease because the day we signed our lease was the day that there was an incentive to keep our same rate. Long story short after fighting with the leasing office and the corporate office we were forced to pay a higher rate. We found 2 males to take over our lease, when we were in the office a staff member told the 4 of us that they could take over our lease but since they are males they would be placed in a different apartment. We all agreed that would be fine. The males applied and got approved, but my roommate and I were never contacted. When I contacted the office they said that we were still stuck with our lease because the two males were living in a different apartment not ours. I contacted corporate because I was extremely upset that they went back on their word, didn't tell us they weren't letting us out of our lease, and STILL took the males that WE BROUGHT in and offered them an apartment. After arguing with the office staff coincidentally that night our apartment door was egged and was not washed off by maintenance for 5 days.

Overall this company and staff are just very inconsiderate of students and if you live here you will stress way too much. I highly recommend to stay away from this place, don't let them trick you into signing a lease.< /Review><time>1483478295952<//time>< user_name>

Dear Owner, do you have on site courtesy patrol? If not, please think about investing in one so the next time someone is locked in to your parking lot, the person doesn't spend half an hour revving their engine, yelling names and RAMMING YOUR GATE to get out. It started at 545 am. Your surrounding neighbors will be very thankful for that.<//Text>

They have shady business practices and if something happens so that you can't pay your rent you are screwed and they don't care at all. They will relentlessly call everyone they possibly can to collect your money. We have been trying to find somebody to take over the lease for months and now that we can't afford to wait any longer they are screwing us in ways we never even imagined. This place should not exist.

Also if you're getting the idea that this place is only bad if you can't afford it, then keep reading.

The staff is very friendly, yes, but only if you aren't having any issues. They were super rude when we were simply trying to figure everything out and treated us like we were stupid.

The apartments themselves are not in good condition, I walked on the balcony and it felt like it was sinking in and squishy from rot. There were burn marks on the tile and the lights in the kitchen were disgusting from god knows what, the carpet had light green stains near the kitchen.

There is only 1 vehicle allowed per apartment and you need a parking permit for the "visitor parking" so if you arrive late and don't have a permit in advance your car might get towed during a 10 minute visit or while you're moving your stuff in. They wont even allow you to have a parking permit for family or friends if they are the person who drives you everywhere which you'll most likely need since you probably won't be able to have your car if youre sharing a room with roommates like most do. If you live by yourself it is also beyond overpriced.

Bottom line. Let this place go out of business.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Water shutoffs too occasionally.

Some of the employees do not know their information. They do not provide any assistance and are just looking at ways to make money.

They were too stingy to change the battery of my remote because some days I would walk to school and just served as an inconvenience for me because I cannot open the gate.

One time, I parked in someone's spot because there was literally no spaces left. The office called me before they called the tow truck which is appreciated. However, the office gave out my name to the person that I parked in their spot. Was it necessary to give out my name like that? Not cool.

Apartment is decent because my roommates and I keep it clean.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1467935114721, 'text': "Hello Trang,\nThank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

I have never seen an apartment where they rent space or single room out. Makes no sense, you pay to feel uncomfortable and just live and pay and shut up, wow so sad, we call then steeling from future minorities or educated people< /Review>

DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! They will charge you with high fees every chance they get and none of the money (which is a lot) that you give them will ever go to the complex! The laundry rooms don't lock and clothes get stolen, and homeless people do drugs and sleep in them at night. The apartments rooms are all roach infested, windows and doors in poor shape, and the staff here is very unhelpful (especially Brooke). Also, dont be fooled by the pictures, the pool sucks.</text>

To summarize my experience here, you pretty much get what you pay for (maybe less) compared to other apartments near the UCR campus in terms of quality.

Campus Crossings is one of the very few apartment complexes that allows you to sign a 10-month lease plan, which is one of the major reasons why my friends and I chose to stay here. In addition, the price was relatively low compared to the other places we looked at. The customer service is also very nice and will help you with your troubles.

Upon moving in, our 3 bedroom 2 bathroom unit was clean overall. There were, however, some weird "adjustments/fixes" made, such as a giant patch in the carpet because of a previous stain and the floor near one of the bedrooms not being level, but these aren't major issues.

Throughout the year, there have been a lot of water maintenances and shutoffs. However, these occur most of the time when I am at school, so it hasn't affected me all that much. Speaking of water, the temperature of the water tends to fluctuate a lot, which is a bit annoying.

We haven't really experienced any roach or bug problems, but this is most likely because we live on the 2nd floor. Although, there have been a lot of dead bees that end up on our porch.

One of my main complaints with the apartment is how it was advertised as "gated", because this place is NOT gated. Anyone can literally walk into the complex, so there have been several times when I've encountered homeless people digging through the trash while I was throwing out my own. In addition, because of the amount of homeless people, I've experienced my bike being messed with (including my back wheel coming close to falling off and the chains being touched). The only reason I lock it outside is because we don't have room to put it in the apartment. Therefore, I strongly think they should take off the "gated" feature off the website to prevent people from thinking this place is actually gated (I also didn't get to check out the apartment before moving in because I am from NorCal and signed the lease over the summer online).

I'd say that if you are in your "last resort" phase in looking for a place to stay for the school year, then come here. Other than that, I'd rather pay a bit more for somewhere that is higher in quality.</Review>

<Review>I lived here for 2 years. Positive reviews are received solely by college students trying to win a Starbucks card for their review. REVIEWER Magna used to work in the leasing office and roommate of Brooke Jackson aka the Assistant manager. So obviously she had no issues and had a great experience. I on the other had nothing but bad experience after bad experience.

The staff is full of young kids every year working here that has no knowledge or concept of office work. But friendly as all hell but so unaware and untrained to know how to answer simple questions.

So spider and roach infestation that's true. Water shut offs, pipes bursting constantly is true. Loud parties with underage drinking. True. Homeless people patrolling the property at all hours. Camping out under the covered ports, true. Over charging ppl for every little thing. True.

I recently moved out and found water damage in my bedroom carpet. I had a freaking mushroom plant growing on my carpet. So whomever moves to apt 71. Make sure they replaced ALL the carpet in that damn apt bc they charged me $130 to pet treat rotting carpet. I'll be posting pictures.

I don't need a fake management response to my review. You guys do not care about the property or tenants. My list can go on but folks read my 3rd updated yelp review of this place. You'll read and see the hassle dealt with this place.< /Review>< username>

<Text>I just moved in and I've already had an awful experience. The apartment is run down, the neighbors are constantly having parties with underage drinking, staying up well past midnight, screaming and yelling. The leasing office refused to give me my key until I filled out renters insurance, which they didn't tell me about until after I had moved in. My roommates are gone for the weekend while I'm writing this review and I'm currently locked out of my apartment. I called the leasing office about my situation and they can get me back into my apartment... for a fee of $75. As a college student I simply can't afford that, and I feel it's unfair because they put me in this situation in the first place.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Campus Crossings clearly cares about saving face more than serving customers. Although this issue is finally being resolved, management and staff at Campus Crossings did nothing to help. In order to finally get Campus Crossings parent company to intervene and have my legal rights respected and get my security deposit back, I had to over the course of three months:

1. Call Campus Crossings at least ten times.
2. Email Campus Crossings and/or Campus Apartments at 8 different email addresses at least ten times.
3. Publically shame Campus Crossings on their Facebook page. (You cannot see this post, because they DELETED it)
4. Publically shame Campus Apartments on their Facebook page.
5. Publically shame Campus Crossings on their Yelp page.
6. Contact a lawyer and let it be known to Campus Apartments that I had done so.
7. Contact a news station and let it be known to Campus Apartments that I had done so.

The effort I had to go through in order to have my legal rights respected is absolutely ridiculous. My legal rights would not have been resolved if I did not take the aforementioned actions.

It was an insult to my intelligence when Jose emailed Michele telling her the issue had been resolved when it had not been resolved. I called Patches from Campus Crossings an innumerable amount of times. She said Jose would call me back on multiple occasions, and he never did. He only seemed to give a crap after I contacted Campus Apartments and likely got him in trouble. Even after he finally responded to one of my emails just once, he never responded to any other emails again.

When Jose did respond that one time, he ignored my primary concern, only acknowledging an issue with mailing but not with the dollar amount, which shows that he read less than half my email. Jose demonstrated that he never had any intention of resolving my issue and that all he cared about was getting Campus Apartments off his back. Another example of when he skimmed over my email and ignored vital information occurred on Friday, November 7th. After telling him my mailing address via email on at 12:32pm, he called me five times, left one voicemail, and emailed me once between 12:52pm to 1:10pm asking for my mailing address. HELLO, I JUST GAVE IT TO YOU 20 MINUTES AGO, not to mention giving it to your staff several other times prior.

Patches from Campus Crossings showed a serious lack of customer service skills as well. Via phone, she promised to have pictures of my apartment sent to me. When I called her later, she insisted that she never promised such a thing and insisted I must have talked to a different employee. With a unique name like Patches, I remember who I talked to, and it was her. Furthermore, another time when I called her, she promised Jose would call me back before close of business. He never did, and when I called back the next day, she did not remember who I was. She blamed her poor memory on the fact that she has to "talk to a lot of people every day. I would think someone with basic customer service skills would remember a customer who was as infuriated as I was and who had called numerous times in the recent past.

The competence of management at Campus Crossings needs to be seriously scrutinized.</Text>

<Text>i decided to give pizza hut another shot after not eating it for many ears. that was a mistake. i won't be ordering from this location or any other for that matter. the pizza had minimal flavor and the bread sticks tasted like cardboard. the price also wasn't the best for what we received. why the service fee? i'll be visiting more local pizza places or other chains.</Text><Response>{'time': 1605563861526, 'text': "Hi Fernando, we're sorry to hear that you were unhappy with your order from us.

Purchased a specialty pizza an 4 sodas.... pizza was great, but the delivery person put the sodas on top of the pizza?!? Next time I won’t tip before delivery. $8.50 way to much for this person.  Really sad service!!!< /Review>

There is a person called Brian who alwyas calls back to make sure this happens, he claims to be a new hire, sometimes a store manager; WHO KNows TBh; but what is known he wants to go home an hour earlier, that is for sure.
If you accidentally don't tip the delivery you don't get a notification that food was delivered, and in turn your order will definetley sit at your door until it is not fresh.
I extremely recommend not to rely on ordering food from this particular PizzaHut store, sincerely. Other PizaaHut stores had been always better,,, Sad</Review>< time>

the boston pepperoni pizza we ordered did not have ANY pepperoni. Too much of a hassle to call at 11pm so we just ate it, but we wont be ordering again. Dominos or Frozen pizza.</Review>

There was a hair in my pizza. I thought they are being super careful packing our food!! Anyways Robert had nothing to say to me other than of I wanted a new pizza they would make one or credit me for the Next time! No thank you. How about let your employees know they need to be careful that's all I expected to hear. Not at all. Never Again!</review>

You wrote a review for Pizza Hut	3 weeks ago
1.0 star rating7/5/2020
This was a 1st time order from this location.

DELIVERY ORDER: Large 2 topping, thin crust pizza, 12pc hot wings.
COST (without driver tip): $36.79

I have consumed quite a few pizza slices in my life for literally, decades. Having my first ever as a child at Shakey's in San Gabriel, I was hooked!

This pizza was THE ABSOLUTE WORST I have ever experienced. Two others who shared it also agreed. If, as a child I had experienced this pizza as my first, I would have an aversion to pizza and everyone would think I was weird.

When it arrived, it resembled an old pizza that had been in the refrigerator for over a week. In terms of taste, it however, rivaled the cardboard box it was in.

The garlic parmesan hot wings were satisfactory.

Moral of the story:  Don't assume that because you had a good Pizza Hut pizza in the past somewhere that you'll  get that same quality at another location...<//text>

<Review>Did the contactless delivery, ordered 3 different pizzas and everything was awesome.  Pizza delivered in a timely manner and each box is sealed with a tag at the HUT, boxes placed in clear packaging and sealed, driver rings doorbell, places delivery at ur doormat.  Yay!

<text>Super disappointed. Noticed that the prices went up in the last 2 months, but what the heck I ordered delivery anyways. A true mistake.Ordered 2 medium pizzas and 8 piece boneless wings. The pizzas are sad and smaller but whatever, what was a complete rip-off was receiving the tiniest 8 piece bone out wings I ever seen. Also you have to PAY for chili pepper flakes and parmesan cheese packets now. At least the delivery guy was cool.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1559342453818, 'text': "Hi Angelica, I'm sorry that you are unhappy with the wings you received from us recently and that we now charge $1 for our mini shakers.

I am filing a compliant with the San Bernardino Health Department. One employee was there more concerned with his wife and came over and kissed her. There are only 3 seats in the restaurant. She sat in one and had food from somewhere else in another seat. My family (3 of us) could not sit. And the worst was another employee was on her phone, then started touching ingredients for pizza. Then she went and handled money, and then went back to making pizzas, without washing her hands. It was recorded on video and being sent to Health Department for review.</text>

Have had multiple experienced multiple bad experiences when I've ordered for delivery. Twice I've had the wrong pizza delivered to me usually I dont care to complain however this time when I tried to pay with a larger bill I was told the delivery personnel only carry 15 dollars in change I wish it would have told me online that anything larger than a 20 was not accepted when I called the store no other option was given to me since my card has been stolen and they took the pizza back to the store.< /Review>

< review>
Ordered there on a Saturday night around 8:00p.m. Asked for a Large stuffed crust pizza with 2 toppings and an order of the Hershey's cookie. I would have ordered online to use coupons, but there system was down, and the price came to be 36.00$ + tax. I was fine paying this absurd price, but the problem occured when the pizza arrived. The pizza was nothing but grease, pooling in the middle of the pizza. I tried ignoring it, tried padding it with a napkin, but it was simply too much. My stomach began to ache from all of the grease of the pizza. The cookie, was not even sliced as it usually always is, and was just baked and tossed into the box. Highly disappointed and incredibly dissatisfied. Waste of my money. This is the first time this Pizza Hut has reached this level of low for me. Cheers.</review>

When the pizza came, it looked like it was prepared 2 days before. That was outrageous. When I called, the Manager hung up on me. I went up there and the Manger was horrible at his job, he wouldn’t tell me anything and wouldn’t give me his last name. I wouldn’t go there and I want him to be fired. His name is Robert N.

<Text>Just the food would have gotten 5, but that Josh character of a "manager" has got to go. I cannot think of a more unaccommodating (I arrived at 11:02 and they refused my already placed order 20 min prior online) and as I asked them what they gonna do with my $40+ order, some dude said in the back with loud enough volume for me to hear through glasses: "We will be enjoying it for u" while the Josh dude refused to acknowledge me after shrugging at me. Fire code license expired for over six months, the safety for ur workers? Since fire Dept are all locally based, and governed by municipal codes, I cannot think of anybody other than holding Josh responsible. I don't even know if this person is real or their collective code of scapegoat....grumble</Text>< Pics>

Today, Josh H., the day manager at this location refused to honor corporate coupon for my family and I.  If the owner of this location is reading I would highly recommend customer service and telephone training for this location's management staff.  I've had a very poor experience for the second time at this location and felt the need to notify the owner because if I were the owner I would surely like to know.  I hate to leave such a poor review, but this location needs some TLC - trust me.<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Ordered for delivery last night an hour before closing and the pizzas were never delivered, they charged my card but later refunded the money. Called up their today to ask why it was never delivered. I talked to someone claiming to be a manager named Josh, he told me the reason was because I ordered online and when they tried to call my phone it was disconnected, yet that wasn't true I was on the same phone talking to him. Then he went on to tell me it's their policy to call the customers first and confirm their order because it could be a "prank order" even once they charged the card they still think it could be a prank? Sounds to me like some asses need canned up their, that'll be the last time I attempt to order anything from Pizza hut. Oh and on top of it all my son's had their friends at the house for a sleep over, so 6 kids went hrs wonder where their pizza was. But as Josh told me I guess it's my fault.</review>< pictures>

Pizza was overcooked all I got was cheese and veggies even the veggies sucked and apparently they don't cook spinach just throw it fresh on your pizza!! What happened to customer service needs?? I called to complain to manager and she was like thanks for your call !!!! Like woman hello  what you going to do about it!!! A real manager would be like let me retake a order or give you some credit for next time order!!! Dominos would own to there horrible pizza with no questions asked!!!<//text>

A guy with long hair in the food area
Not sure why they wear a hat if the guys hair loose. No rubber band to hold it place.  I won't be back here anymore.<//Review>

I called the pizza hut chain and they had no idea if they even included the code at all. I am greatly disappointed by this lack of service. (and yes i tried entering the store code, but the survey tells me to enter the 11 digit code)</Text>< response>

We ordered their New York Special and Shrimp Pesto medium size pizzas. Overall, both we're pretty good. The crust is thin and they throughly spread the toppings and cheese to the very end of the crust. Unlike some places where the crust is thick and lots of crust. Because the crust is thin, your slice of pizza does tend to get limp which is not bad when it's hot and fresh. I recommend giving them a try and take advantage of their website coupons. Their online ordering system is also very easier to use so check that out too. I'll go there again and probably try their other pizzas.</text>

First time trying this location, they didn't disappoint.  Quality of the food was as expected and service was great. Only reason why I gave them 4 stars was cause one of the people behind the counter blatantly wasn't wearing a mask.< /Review>

<Review>pretty bad pizza. the crust is true NY style, doughy and crispy at the same time. that is the only good thing about it.
Everything else is off. Not good flavor wise. Lots of garlic and almost no other spice in the sauce. Overpriced as well.

Skip this one.<//Review>< time>

Lets just say, the price is too much for what we've received! forty something dalliers for 2 medium pizzas and soda... Lets put it another way, Little Caesars pizza tastes better!!! I wasn't looking for okay pizza I was hoping better. Final note, DO NOT TELL me that pizza will be done in 10-15 min if its not going to be done! I've waiting an extra 15 min after arriving 20 min later once I placed my order, Not right at all!< /Text>< Pictures>

The best New York style pizza and closest thing to New York I’ve tasted. The greatest deal bang for your buck is the cheese King Kong pizza for $25. It can feed a family or 5 co-workers and I all pitched in and it fed all of us and still had some left over. They offer free delivery and pizza always comes hot. Highly recommend</Text>

Not only is the pizza here FANTASTIC, but the people are super humble. I had a door dasher who seemed like they didnt own a smartphone and never delivered the pizza, so I re-ordered and these guys actually called me to clarify they did give the dasher the pizza and ask what happened. Even for such a small thing it really made me feel like they care about what they do. I appreciate that tenfold over quality of food.<//Review>

<rate>4</rate><review>Large pizza, order of wings, and one salad was more than enough for 3 adults.  Stopped here on our way to the airport.  Pizza was pretty good , but could be a bit more crisp on the bottom (really kind of floppy in the middle, but not undercooked).  Wings were offered with one basic medium Buffalo sauce with ranch. Overall, it was a good stop.< /review>< Pictures>

Very good crispy pizza by the slice. I ordered a slice of the New York Special ($5) which was a supreme pretty much and a slice of the regular cheese ($4). The slices are huge. Both were very good. It was reasonably priced. The owners were friendly.< /Text>

I have to tell you since I have downloaded the Slice app it has never let me down. It searches for local, yes LOCAL pizza joints which I appreciate and I found one close to me yesterday that delivered great food on time which anyone would expect. The food as I mentioned being great man was well....great! Now I will say this though for a place or any place for that matter that has New York in its name or claiming to have New York style pizza should have such.
If my only critique it would be that that i want what i have seen on tv, in movies (ninja turtles) and have had in person which is wide slices and dripping cheesey goodness that can fold like a burrito.<//Text>

<text>Ordered penne Alfredo and fried zucchini. Both the Alfredo sauce and marinara sauce were bland. The food was warmish and took an hour to get here. The restaurant is only a few minutes away. They charged a delivery fee after advertising free delivery. I give it two stars instead of one because the portion size is generous. I should have called Pizza Hut.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I was trying to order pizza and i am so excited because it will be my first time to try New York Pizza. Been seeing the pizza place every day going to work. I do not like the way the person on the phone taking the orders. He was so rude and hung up the phone on me. Our place is not that hard to find. I told him our frint door is facing the Commodore Park. He said my address is hard to find. Its just San Bruno then Cherry avenue and its really close to them. I called again and he asked if i want to order. I said yes but I changed my mind because I realized he might do something not nice to my pizza or spit on it. Not anymore to this Pizza place!</review>

I'm from Texas and was flying out yesterday and wanted pizza before we left. We came up on this location by chance and man it was a great come up. The pizza was so dang good we had to order another one. Talk about fat full before my flight. Food was great service was good as well, the decor is in need but keep making those awesome pies. We will be back. Texas love😊</review>

Overall great pizza but the last time I ordered from here. My pizza was burnt on the bottom of the crust. I will give them one more try because they make your slice of pizza when you place your order it's not sitting up all day displayed for everyone to see.< /Text>

<review>I really wanted to love this place. It's a hole in the wall but was clean enough. Their pizza smelled wonderful but I had pizza earlier in the week so I chose one of their sandwiches instead. I had the Chicken Primavera and it was just so so. It lacked robust flavor. I will be back to try their pizza some day.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I’m from away, but this was some of the best Pizza I’ve had in a long time (and an awesome price)

I ended up shame eating the whole thing in my hotel room. Worth every penny<//review>

The lunch special is enough to hold you over until dinner. Everything is made to order, even single slices, no wait on a pizza is about 15 mins for it to be cooked, call ahead if you dislike waiting. A little on the pricier side, but I love the quality of food here! The pizza is definitally worth trying!< /Text>

<Text>I went in to get lunch and when I walked in there was no one at the counter to take my order so I went to the bathroom and when I came out an older gentleman asked me if he could help me I said just a minute Bcuz my friend had stepped outside and he yells at me that bathrooms are for customers only and to not come back. I then called and attempted to voice that I had gone in to place an order and I'm sure that the same man answered the phone, proceeded to SCREAM at me and told me that bathrooms are for customers only and not to come back. I'm not from the area so that won't be a problem but what a terrible experience. If I could give 0 stars I would but since that isn't an option I'll opt for 1.< /Text>< pictures>

Waited over 1 1/2 for a pizza that never arrived. I even tipped 20% on ordering. These guys are scum bags. Avoid at all costs.<//Review>

<time>1524808296070< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) They serve pizzas fresh from the oven, good portion and hot. I'm not trying a lot of pizza but it is very good. It has an entrance that facilitates access for people with wheelchairs although the door and moving within the premises can be narrow for accessibility. Prices are well affordable.

(Original)
Sirven pizzas recién salidas del horno, buena porción y caliente. No soy de probar mucho pizza pero si es muy bueno. Tiene entrada que facilita el acceso de personas con sillas de ruedas aunque la puerta y moverse dentro del local puede ser estrecho para la accesibilidad.

Cant say enough about the penny bar. Best Ribeye n eggs. Worth the ride out. But one of my favorite things besides the atmosphere is the free cake. Every time I have come here they give me a free piece of cake makes my day every time<//text>

This place is WAY out of the way unless you're traveling on highway 33 already but it's worth the trip out there just to check it out. The restaurant is nothing special but the food is decent and the staff fun and friendly. The draw is the Penny Bar. Walls, the bar, the restrooms, the pool table, all covered in pennies! Great bike ride destination!</Text>

<Text>Great food, fun place to look around, but the best part of our meal was Sabrina, our server. We were a noisy, large family group, with lots of changes and questions, and Sabrina was very gracious and made the whole meal a lot more fun. Coconut cream pie was wicked good too!<//Text>< resp>

<gmap_id>0x80eba5485d5a0275:0x472bd822f019919</gmap_id><text>McKittrick is an oil town. Surrounded by producing oil wells in the southwestern corner of Kern County, McKittrick provides a small town atmosphere. One highlight is the McKittrick Hotel, now a short order cafe and Penny Bar.

The Penny Bar flat surfaces are covered with pennies, with their variety of brightness and hue to form words and pictures. Cold brews also make for a friendly bar. Their menu has contracted due to current California public places limitations. But go visit when things open up and you take the back roads.< /text>< response>

The place looks old and run-down, maybe even a bit sketchy, but the food was good.  I got an ortega burger which was cooked perfectly and very tasty, with a huge order of onion rings.  The onion rings were a little unevenly cooked, but the amount of batter on them was just right.  My husband got a pastrami sandwich, which he said was very good, but the salad was disappointing -- iceberg lettuce with a couple if cherry tomatoes, smothered in shredded cheese and drowned in dressing.</review>

<review>I don't give five stars lightly.

This place is worth the 20 minute drive from Buttonwillow/I-5 if you have the time.

Was here for breakfast. It is NOT fast food. It was cooked to order and took a few extra minutes. Worth the wait.

I particularly enjoyed the biscuits & gravy. The omelette was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but by no means bad.

Everything was too hot to eat when it arrived, I had to wait for it to cool down. I can't remember the last time I've had to do that. It was actually wonderful! If you normally order just coffee you might consider adding water to your request to have something in case you need to cool your mouth.

It's small town quirky, with the best of small town atmosphere. I'd really love it if they got a heck of a lot busier. I look forward to visiting again when I can.</review><Rating>5< /Rating>< pictures>

Stopped here for lunch on my way to Carrizo Plains,
The food was terrible, and the service was worse!  Even though my family of 3 was the only people in the restaurant, it was hard to get silverware, drinks or food that was edible.  Two thumbs down.
My suggestion is to make sure you pack a lunch while traveling thru this area!</text>

Friendly staff helps make this eatery a decent place to park yourself and rest before venturing out further where there are no food/drink establishments for very many miles.</text>

<Review>Tom responded quickly and got me schedule within 2 days. Price quoted was very reasonable. Sheila insured that I knew my appointment was confirmed and was very pleasant in following up. Joe the electrician was courteous, knowledgable and friendly. He did a meticulous job hanging our chandelier in the dining room and installing a dimmer switch. He did a great job of cleaning up after himself and removing all trash. I highly recommend this business!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmQQCDuOpjqUjvIAeriaR7xtloiQs2ZkWQ4GdZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDcVVNQktDJoeC2GFUR8wWbEicWYpTtDja9X6J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dceb1cee919c45:0xb4ffe8cf050baac5< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The company was extremely responsive to my needs.  And the electrician, Alex, was friendly, knowledgeable, and handled multiple jobs while he was at our house.  I highly recommend the business for your household electric needs!< /Text>

<GmapID>0x80dceb1cee919c45:0xb4ffe8cf050baac5<//GmapID><review>Called them on a Monday afternoon, they had some one out first thing the next day. We had a collection of jobs that needed to be done, they gave us an expected quote, with some additional information about how the price could change depending on any complications that may arise while doing the job. The rep also took the time to explain what some of the issues could be.

Technicians arrived on time, walked through the each task that needed to be done to make sure they understood before getting to work. The technicians took care to cover any area that would require cutting into the dry wall, and explained anything they felt I needed to know about the job they did, as well as answering any questions I may have had.< /review><Time>1612934497924</Time><Response>None<//Response>< user_name>

The company is well-run.  They are responsive and professional.  They provide detailed quotes.

Our team arrived on-time and did the work efficiently in one day, when other companies we received quotes from told us they expected 2-3 days.  We had several outlets relocated, new lights installed, a ceiling fan installed, and new shop lights installed in the garage.

Dennis, Reid, and Nick were clean and professional, and wore masks for safety.  Did the work well.  100% going back next time we need anything.< /Review>< Pictures>

Our house had some wiring challenges, and a previous electrician had not been able to do it. Tom at The Tradesman was not only very responsive, but also knowledgeable about various electric systems. We had to have drywall cut to enable a hardwire doorbell installation, an electric switch relocated, and an outlet installed. All three jobs were handled (in two sessions) by personable, caring and skilled employees Reed and Carl. I recommend this company highly.<//text>

<text>Dennis is always professional, responsive and helpful. He takes the time to troubleshoot and doesn't try to sell me. His work is solid and he stands by it.  Prices are very competitive and even if you think they are a little high, keep in mind you don't have to project manage these guys.  They come when they say they will come and not waste your time trying to track them down.</text>< pics>

<Review>I’m an older guy and have been in the trades for part of my life. I know good service when I see it. I know a good work ethic when I see it. The Tradesman Electric sent me their “A”team. He sent me a message that they would be there at 7:30am and they showed up a little before that ready to go to work. They worked about 11 hours today at my house and completed the entire job. Tell me folks, how often in your life does that happen?  That has happened only a few times in my entire life and today was one of them. The job was professional, the cleanup excellent and their attitude was incredible. 5 stars for The Tradesman Electric!</Review><Name>Ray Thompson</Name></record>

<Review>I had a ceiling fan installed in a bedroom. Tom and crew were very thoughtful to ensure interior floors and furniture were protected. They even knew to remove a comforter before covering a bed with plastic they needed to stand on so seams and threading wouldn't pop. I never knew that was even a concern. Now I just wish I had picked a better looking ceiling fan!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Needed some urgent electrical work done in our yard - low voltage as well as regular voltage work. After they finished, our fountains are working and our garden lights up like a model home! Recommend them to anybody. They also have a great technology platform that informs you via text and Email that the Technician has been scheduled/is on his way/has finished the job. Absolutely perfect.< /Review>< user_name>

<text>Tom Sheltraw, of The Tradesman Electric, is incompetent.  He did over $5000 of electrical work during a remodel of our house that not only was shoddy, but it violated the California Electrical Code.

After having a legitimate electrician do the repairs, we sent a letter to The Tradesman Electric asking for a refund.  In our letter, we cited to him the electrical code he violated.  Since he ignored our letter, we filed a complaint with the California License Board.  It was only after the License Board investigated the case and informed Tom Sheltraw that he had indeed violated the electrical code that he agreed to refund our money back.

If I could give this guy a negative rating, I would.<//text><user>106654241957548702131<//user>< pictures>

<user>116256034627652238703< /user><review>This review has to broken into two parts, which combine for the score. The original work was to run electricity to our back yard for both a future spa (220) and a branch for a future BBQ installation (110). Initial work was completed with the understanding that the stub for the 110 was ready for when the BBQ was built (and would be tapped from) and that the 220 was ready for spa installation (spa-ready was the request). This work was done timely and the team was very nice and helpful.

Part 2 was when spa arrived, and what transpired since then. The 220 box did not have some necessary parts, and the offered help to explain what additional parts would be needed (as well as where to plug them in) in lieu of an additional $300 has not transpired. Pictures of the installation, the parts (wires and GFCI) as well as the spa manual have been provided and for two weeks I have gotten "we'll get back to you". I had held off approaching other options, but after 2 weeks I would really like to get my spa up and running and can't wait for answer any longer.

It is frustrating because spa-ready meant one thing to me and clearly something different to the installers. What was done was not ready for immediate installation (more than just the wire run was required) and the lack of response has not made me a long time fan.

I would recommend to anyone using their services to, as you would with any contractor, ensure that the results truly match your needs before you sign off. My fault for not fully understanding what I would need for the future spa setup, but I was relying on the professionals here and I paid for it (literally).< /review>< Rating>

Awesome crew, great price, excellent service.  These guys nailed it.  I've had a bunch of subs come through my place and these guys are the only ones who performed on time and on budget.  They installed approximately 27 recessed LED cans into a rental unit plus a new panel and a handful of additions and changes that they took on without an issue.  They will definitely be hired again in the future.</Review>

<review>I wanted to take a few minutes to express our thoughts on a job well done. Tom Sheltraw’s company The Tradesman Electric.
My wife and I were looking for someone to run new wiring and install a lighting fixture in the dining area and a fan with a light in the living room. The living room has an 18-foot ceiling with beams.
Tom’s crew of Brandon, Jerry and Andrew were extremely knowledgeable. After going over the details of what we wanted they came up with several different suggestions on how the install could be done.
The job was completed on time and on budget with no ups or extra charges. This was a competitive bid project.
We would definitely use Tradesman Electric again and highly recommend them on all counts.

I had been calling all over town to find a good, affordable and honest electrician and we found that plus ten times more! Tom and his crew were amazing!  Not only did they do the electric hookups and conduit for our spa, they also put in a light fixture for our garage all for cheaper than the other electricians from whom we had received our cheapest quote! He gave me a quote and stuck with it without any hidden changes or complications. They were timely, professional and really care about their clients! We just moved into our new house and have 5 little kids so Tom took it upon himself to fix other loose wires that were hanging out of its conduit which, I noticed, other electricians in the past clearly had no idea what they were doing after seeing the Tradesman’s work. What really impressed me the most was when I had to leave for work and left them to finish up in the backyard. When I came home l went outside to check their work and not only did they do a great job, the guys had cleaned up my backyard better than when they came down to the last detail of facing all our smiley face balls in one direction!😂 We cannot wait for them to come back and hook up our spa when it arrives and find other projects for them to do!!! We highly recommend this company!!!<//text>

This place is great! Really clean, and I never have to wait when I come in. They keep really close attention to detail and spend a good deal of time doing eyebrows.< /Review>

Great service. Quick response when I messaged to see if they were open! No appointment needed :) It was very clean and the lady that did my brows was so friendly. She did a really good job .<//Text>

<text>The quality of work at this place was amazing. I don’t really do threading and stuffs but when I do, I really want it to be perfect. Just tell them how you want your eyebrows and you’ll get it. If you want perfect, this is your place. And also extremely humble staffs. Loved it.< /text>< Response>

Just wanted to take a moment and thank Sabina for taking care of my eyebrow. I'm very particular about my eyebrow because it's very light colored and I've thin hair.I don't trust anyone but ladies from Eyebrow Threading. I had a very thin eyebrow but wanted to grow it thick beautifully. Steps by steps leaving some hairs to be grown for the shape I wanted,They exactly knew what they were supposed to do.Now I can leave my brow natural without using any eyebrow pencil.It's thick as I wanted. I've been doing my brows with them ever since I moved to California. Quick service,friendly Staff,good price.

Thank you for the service ladies. Highly recommended!!!< /Text>

<text>This was my very first time trying threading, and it was a great experience! The environment was calm and nice and open. The lady was very nice! I got my whole face done - I am a natural light blonde so I have lots of fine hairs ALL OVER my face. I posted before & afters and you can see all of my little hairs are gone! :)<//text><name>kasie norton<//name>< Gmap_id>

Never like to leave bad reviews but I'm highly upset with quality of her work. BECAUSE IT COSTED ME MY EYEBROWS! It was my first time so I had anyone do them thinking they all had a good work. I told the lady THICK, because I had been growing them out for a month. When I saw the finished product I almost cried. I would not RECOMMEND this place if you want thick eyebrows!</review>

<Text>I was so mad!!!!!!!! I have been there a couple of times. Its a hit and miss with these people. I was happy the at first then on my last visit I think she made a mistake instead of telling me she just made my eyebrows super thin! I have been growing them out and was finally at a point where I it looked good with out filling them in. I asked her why so thin she didn't answer. I asked her what dose a touch up mean? Why would I come in with thicker brows and want super thin without telling you? I will not go there again and it smells weird too!<//Text><user>115579413623703044831</user><GmapID>0x809add6b64602e35:0x7cd9f371fdc1891a<//GmapID><time>1492298711448< /time><rating>1<//rating><name>Tiff Timberlake< /name></record></dataset><record>

Downtown Mountain View is an interesting experience for a very out LGBT person bc there is a veeerryy large Asian and Indian-American community that work in tech that matriculate the area.

So, obviously there is not much in the way of diversity or creative expression.

However, it helps when businesses and staff are genuinely inclusive and welcoming like they are at St. Stephen's Green... 🤗💕🌈<//Text>

My wife and I went here on Saturday and had the best experience. The outdoor dining area has a great atmosphere and then there’s the excellent food and drinks. We had the Stephen burger, one of the best I’ve ever had. Excellent service, server’s are attentive to your needs, we will be going back very soon thank you 😊<//text>

Dropped in at 12:45 on 8/5/19 at the enticement of seeing Shepard's Pie on the menu posted outside. So glad I did! Generous bowl with way more tasty beef than creamy mashers. Served with beautiful assorted lightly sauteed veggies.  I had to ask Gilbert, the attentive Barman, for a take out box. My half Scots Irish soul is happy!  😋< /text>

Note: their haddock fish fry could stand up to a Buffalo, NY fish fry. If you know what I'm talking about, it's totally worth a try.

This is the experience I have every time I dine or drink with St. Stephen's Green.<//text>< rate>

Good personnel, nice service.
Happy hour till 6.30PM (Drinks less than $5, 30% on food)
It seems that they add water or something to the beer (happy hour) and use low quality alcohol on discount menu. Rest is fine.</text>

Breakfast was unreal. The hash were crispy but moist.  Monte Cristo was cooked to perfection, enough sugar powder but not over powering.  The bloody Mary was one of the best ever.  Must try.</Review>

<Text>The atmosphere is fun and inviting. Our server and hostess were kind and attentive. The food came out pretty quickly and was delicious. It is a little pricey for what you get. I ordered the southwestern burger ($17) and a drink ($9). They are pretty heavy handed with the liquor in their cocktails which makes them worth the price.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5iOIuJTwN9_Jkgfye39OovYek8TsA8VAgV1kr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNI0OB9HSVO_NmhJ_WGreQKEIDHCNXGGEkfVXAS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fb7340e27f3b1:0xc5a872c20c5547a1< /GmapID></record>

Their cocktail menu is relatively thin and disappointing. I enjoy places more who have some signature drinks or at least something to make them stick out. Their Old Fashions are underwhelming. But the rest of the drinks were good and the atmosphere outdoors were nice. Very friendly staff. As basic as it is, they had a really good mojito.</Review>

<Review>Stopped because they were the only place showing the football game. Didn’t have high expectations from the outside, but have to say that the SMOKED SALMON SALAD was surprisingly delicious!
BUFFALO WINGS were a 3 out of 5, they weren’t bad but were a bit chewy.<//Review><resp>None< /resp><pics>None< /pics><Rating>4</Rating>< gmapID>

Quality local bar. It had a nice atmosphere and is my go to for any sports. Lots of TVs and they pull down a couple of projectors for big games. The beer selection is solid, but the food is a bit pricey for what you pay for. I guess that's to be expected for the Bay Area... Overall highly recommend over the other bars in.

<text>Service and Atmosphere. Sadly, good service and comfortable atmosphere can only take you so far. Food and drink have to play a role, and here the role is only a bit part. It’s not that the food is bad, it’s just glaringly mediocre yet priced far above its quality. But, perhaps I just didn’t order the right thing. Beer was good though...

I must say the service was amazing. The staff was friendly and attentive, but not in a pushy or rushing manner. They seemed to relate well with their customers and seemed to be enjoying themselves. Combined with the cozy wood decor and numerous TVs for watching football, it is a nice little bar.

Food is only 2 star, but the service is 5 star.<//text>< user_id>

Ordered dinner and a drink for pickup and vegetables. Dinner was delicious and produce was fresh and had more reasonable prices than the grocery store. Highly recommend going to St Stephens Green for your needs during the SIP! We will definitely be ordering from there again.

One of my most loved spots in Mountain View 😀</Text>

The food was good but we ordered the Easter brunch minimum four people. 12/person. It read everyone would get a tart/omelette/etc... They only gave us two of everything and said it should be family style. Being deceitful on Easter is unforgivable.< /Text>

Danica was a great bartender! She was very skillful and was able to handle all bar patrons during her shift. And she was the only one working at the time! Big props to her. The bar/restaurant was very spacious and the environment was relaxed (Monday night). Need to come back here again!< /text>

Their Irish Curry is delicious! Lots of TVs so it's a great spot for if you're trying to catch a football game. But go early because it gets packed. Oh and the drinks...definitely doesn't disappoint.< /Text>

It's cozy place with old structure.

Bartenders are okay, drinks are good but I didn't like the bar sitting style. There's sort of divider after every two chairs and that makes little uncomfortable for group to sit on bar or to approach any stranger<//review>

The fries are amazing and one of the reasons I love to come here at any hour. The curry is also bomb. I dislike how much smoke they use for the smoke machine when you stay into "club" hours. Just pumps out smoke like crazy and its gross. Otherwise, I love coming here for lunch, watch football with friends and kids, or just to have a few drinks.</review>

<review>I usually go here with my besty since he is a regular Kareoke goer. Love the place so much. Good vive, fun music. The bartenders are pretty nice and quick to prepare your order. On Thursday is Kareoke and is pretty mellow but it doea get fun on Fridays and  Saturdays. Good crowed, everyone us chill and enjoy the good times. I meet new people everytime I go. Dj Mike plays on Thursdays he is awesome. Will continue going here without a doubt!! 😉😉<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWTBiwe8zNYNDD7LN3ejC22Yxdk3r2bLQOQS8P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>I have to give a 1 as the staff forgot I was there. I checked with the bartender to order a drink and food (dine in)  and he said they have a waitress just take a seat. After 18 minutes, I returned to the barman and let him know nobody even so much as walked near the front of the building.

Bummer. Ended up at Eureka down the street and they were more than happy to take my money!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great spot. We come here when we get a chance, usually earlier in the evening. I always have the fish and chips which is just great. The selection of beer is also good and the atmosphere is casual. Service is friendly and fast thought they are a little understaffed when it gets full. The big surprise was how kid friendly this place is around 5 or 6 and the happy hour is a steal.< /text>

If you're looking for a place to hang with friends and have a social evening, it's great here. Food and drinks were standard, it wasn't too loud but also didn't feel like a dead place. Later in the evening, they opened a dance floor with a dj. The DJ was just okay, and there were maybe just 2-3 couples at one time dancing on the floor. I'll come back if a group of friends want to hang.<//review>

We went here on a Friday night just before the kitchen closed. The waitress was rushing us, which was acceptable but she was also unpleasant about it. The music got louder and louder over 40 minutes as they tried to get people in/out. Not sure what they were trying to do. The bartenders were easy to catch hold of, they were attentive and pleasant. This would be a place I'd normally hang out at if the waiting staff was a little nicer.</Review>

4/5 instead of 5/5 because the waitress was super rushed, and came back to grab my receipt a few minutes later while I was still talking with my friend. I hadn't even written the tip or signed yet. She grabbed it, came back, said "oh I need your signature", put it on the table and darted off. It came across as demanding and rushed. I still wrote a tip anyways, but it was less than stellar service</Text>< Pictures>

Food is great.  Everything on the menu is good.  I recommend trying the chipotle grilled wings.  Big selection of craft brew which they keep updating.  10/10<//review>

This place isn't horrible but the bartender was very unfriendly. She just had a scowl on her face the entire time. Like it was an inconvenience she had to do her job</Text>

I love this place. I come here to watch the Seahawks play on the dedicated main screen with my fellow fans. Great beer selection to choose from and I just discovered the chicken burger that is thoughtfully topped with grilled anaheim peppers and peppery arugula for a perfect amount of heat that would have been a rather boring-dry chicken burger.</text>

< review>
I tried to enter around 11:30pm on Saturday night mid January. The security refused me to enter. When I asked why, one of the security said you have been drinking alcohol.
Even though, I didn't do anything to anyone one. Plus I was not inside St Stephen's Green.
I was outside the property, one of the security. He was an African-American, he physically attacked me. Even though, I was not on the property. He pushed my Chase with both of his hands.
Immediately, after he attacked. He was hiding inside the the bar.
I would challenge St. Stephen's Green to provide me a video evidence of my wrong doing.
How could, I get attackedbyby
your employee even though I was never in property. Usually, this kind behavior is a third world problem.
I would definitely challenge the owner & management of Stephen's Green to look this matter very seriously.< /review>

<text>If I could give 0 stars or less I would. Service was terribly slow and we had to push multiple times to get our drinks and the check.

This is not the worst part though. When my friend paid for the check he did not receive his credit card back. After returning to the bar an hour later to pick up the credit card the personnel was completely unwilling to return the credit card even after providing an accurate description of the card (I own a card by the same bank and showed it) and providing two forms of ID.

First the bartender, who was clearly drunk, said they couldn't find the card at all. After we pressed that we were certain the card was left here they went back to the back and later came back and showed it to us. At this point, the bartender said he couldn't give the card and we'd have to come pick it up 3 days later. When asking the bartender why he could not come up with a reasonable explanation.

At this point we called 911 and did our story to the emergency services. While on the phone the manager came over and returned the card to my friend.

I'm completely stunned that it took a 911 call to convince the personnel to return the credit card. We told the emergency services they didn't have to intervene as we got the card back.<//text>< Date>

I have dad dinner there once, the meat pie was really good.

Good atmosphere.  Good beer selection.

I enjoy the place but I'll wait until the evening next time to go.<//text>< Rate>

It's a sports bar. But it has AMAZING food. Great burgers, shepards pie, etc. Really, it's excellent. They even have brunch! Casual seat yourself atmosphere, TVs everywhere so you won't miss your game. Great cocktails and beer.< /Review>

They know how to serve large groups efficiently, don't block the view, and the food is delicious.  I'm not much of a drinker, but folks seem to enjoy the beer - and hot wings.  I enjoyed coffee, omelette  and veggies with potatoes.  Tasty delight!  Friendly competition between fans.</review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Time>

This is probably my favorite sports bar on Castro. The food is reasonably good, they have enough strategically placed television screens to broadcast games.
Vegetarian burger is made with marinated portabello mushroom and the first time I had it it was amazing. On my second go it was "just alright".
I took away one star because when big games/matches are on they charge 50$ to enter.< /review>

<Review>I was with my girlfriend. My friend show up, and then they charged me 5 dollars just for being outside to receipt my friends. Even though I tried to friendly argument that I just got outside to receivey friends, the clerk at the entrance wouldn't allow me to get back, while my girlfriend was inside. And there was no point  to argue with them, I just got expelled of the club. By the club clerk, and their very inappropriate way to deal with customer, I'll definitely do not recommend this place<//Review><resp>None</resp><Date>1538209167408</Date>< Rate>

If there is a game on, the projector turns on and it becomes a great sports bar with a slightly reduced menu of pub favorites. (Wings, nachos, and some heavier items)

On Friday and Saturday nights the dance floor opens and there is usually a DJ. If you come then, expect a cover charge, but it's usually pretty reasonable and there is almost never a line.<//review></record></dataset><record>

It's a good bar, not the best for brunch. Sort of a lackluster menu. Half hearted service. Barely earning my attention as a sunday brunch outing. It's dark and cozy, but there is no seating outside. I feel if they stepped up the good service, and the menu, even if it cost more, the experience would be great.< /Text>

Now in days is a hit and miss. The DJ is also not consistent with his mix. They re-used the dirty glassware to serve you drinks. Horrible service, and the security here sucks! Even if you haven't done anything wrong if they don't like you they'll ask you to leave. It happen to this couple that was next to us. I hate to say this but I think it was because they weren't consuming much. I will definitely not be back to this place and I definitely don't recommend this so call night club.<//text>< pictures>

It's a very lively bar, DJ and they have dance floor as well, especially on weekends. This place is a good for hang out with friends for couple of drinks and dancing if you would like to. The bar is not much expensive as well. I am not sure about food options at this place.<//text>

Cool place to get a drink. They start turning it into a night club on some nights at around 10PM , like Saturdays...but as far as the night club goes, it's not the kind of place I'd think of being a ton of fun</Text>

Irish pub, but leaning too heavily towards sports bar for my taste. If you want a big place with multiple TVs showing multiple games, it's lovely. If you want an Irish bar that's reasonably quiet, try Molly Magees a few doors down.</review>

<review>I've only come in at night for drinks. The crowd is very fun and friendly. Bar service can be slow when it's very crowded but it's usually a non-issue. It's definitely a more relaxed scene for drinks and dancing.< /review>< Pictures>

We had a great time here a few nights ago at the outdoor patio -- they had both Sam Adam summer ale and a pear cider, both of which I love.  My boyfriend got the chicken pot pie and I got the beer beef pot pie, and both dishes were everything I was hoping they would be -- flaky crusts, mashed potatoes, grilled fresh veggies, gravy over the whole thing.  We had a great time.  We're going back again soon.<//text>

Football + brunch + bottomless mimosas?  Excellent combination.  The food isn't superb, but I thought that the bottomless mimosa deal was awesome.  For $8 you get endless refills from 9:30am - 12:00pm.  It was a fun way to spend the morning, and I think it makes for a really fun activity if you and your friends enjoy watching football together since they have every game showing.

Overall, I had a great time.  Make sure that you adjust your expectations and realize that it is a bar, so the food isn't going to blow your mind.  You also need to be forward to get service since they are a bit understaffed in the mornings.</text>

I came here for a late-lunch with a friend. I immediately like the laid-back, pub style feel.

I ordered chicken fingers and a side of fries. I wasn't too keen on the food as it was a bit dry. The chicken fingers were a bit overcooked, and tough on the outside and in. The fries were a bit over-fried too. For the quality of food, I didn't think it was worth the money.

For a drink I got a margarita, and it was actually pretty good. I liked that they mixed it well enough where the tequila wasn't the overwhelming flavor to the drink.<//Text>

This is one of the best places in the south bay to watch soccer. Big matches and USA team games almost always draw a pretty good crowd, though I wish they opened early for Premier League games.

The food is on the better side of bar food and has always exceed expectations in terms of pub-style food. They also recently revamped their beer menu to bring in a greater selection of craft and local beers.<//review>

<Text>went on a Thursday night. no cover. drinks were good. dj was ok.. not really playing much music to dance to. but later in the night it got better.

I would go back. might have been an off night for the dj or something.

bottom line dj can change but the staff and atmosphere will be good when you go.

<text>Nice little location. They have trivia nights on Wednesday and play good music however it's top 40. I can speak to their menu but will update this review once I do have an entre. It's a little loud for my taste but not unexpected. Would come back</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rating>

<Review>Alright so... Went there for dinner and drinks. Got a couple pitchers and waited for a bit. Server took our order and then apparently the ordering system went down. Waiting another 20-30 minutes and was told they forgot about the food, but now the kitchen was closed. Was hilarious. It was the servers first week and she offered to buy us pizza. We didn't take up that offer, but she was fun. Maybe next time.<//Review>< Pictures>

Cool place, but can be really crowded on weekends. I rather go there for a few drinks during weekdays or during the day on weekends. The DJ is not that good :/< /Text>

Happy hour here is real good, get the hot wings and your favorite beer. Calamari is also pretty good. Service is a little slow at happy hour, but they are very nice and the food is cheap.<//review>

The music was pretty good on a Saturday. They said it was latin nights, which is probably why. All I'd say is that they should be more consistent with the type of music they are playing.</review>

The waitress was rude and at the end of the game she told me that I ordered for the earlier game, what was I going to order for the new one and made it a point to speak loud enough so everyone could hear her. Will make sure no one I know visits.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Horrible service. Went there on a recommendation from the kid. Just after the lunch crowed on a Saturday. Maybe 10 to 15 people inside. Waited 10 minutes for a waitress, moved to a more central table. waited another 5 and had to go ask somebody for a menu. Waited another and left. Food might be great but I'll never know.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Jun2016 - This was the best bar in Mt View.o very the last 5 months the service has gone downhill.  Last night I sat down and waited for 15min to get acknowledged and another 5 min to get the wait staff to stop at my table. Once I ordered it took another 15 min to get my beer.urgh!!!!!!< /review>< pics>

Bat is spacey and they'll hold tables for big groups, but unless it's super late on a Saturday night there's always space. Drinks are OK, bar is dark. It turns into a dance club on Saturday nights.<//text>

<Text>This is a great Irish Pub in downtown Mt. View. It has all the important things you'd want for a place like this e.g. good beer selection, generous pours, decent pub food and sports on TV. Staff is attentive and generally friendly with the occasional aloof/annoyed waitress.

About as Irish as it gets in Mountain View. It's got a slightly older crowd, but it gets pretty buck wild in here after 11PM on weekends. Later in the night, the tables and chairs get cleared out and there's loud Top40 music and a DJ on weekends. No cover unless it's special events.< /Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>This place, regardless of being in an inclusive place like Mountain View. Has serious racism issues.

Don't go there if you are Latino/Hispanic.

We were a group of over 15 latinos consuming in a karaoke night. The white woman handling the karaoke there skipped all the songs we asked for (Latin/Hispanic) in favor of American songs (because no one showed up when in fact we where dancing right in front of her cheering and dancing with everybody who got infront of the mic). No explanations, just because racism is still around in 2018 in a place like Mountain View.< /Review>< resp>

Only had appetizers and drinks, but took just over 10 minutes before a server even stopped by, and nearly another 10 for our drinks (draft beers) to arrive. I understand that it was a busy evening, but they seemed far understaffed. Might try again sometime as the food we did eventually get was good, but a bit turned off by the service. Hopefully just an off night<//review>

I had been here earlier it was fine. But this time i was with few friends, it was too crowded & noisy but fine. But the service was horribly bad and the attendent was very arrogant. They took such a long time just to take the order saying they cannot take orders for 10 min or so. I am pretty disappointed with their attitude and service and would definitely never visit again in my lifetime, sorry to say this. They look very moody.</text>

It's a racist place where latins are not welcomed! We are a bunch of Latinamerican community developers visiting the place as tourists after Google I/O. The DJ is a racist woman!< /text>

<Review>Standard pub located in Mountain View. There are a few TVs if you're looking to catch a game.

Wed night is karaoke night - song selections limited, and so is the talent.<//Review>< user_name>

Good wings, good buffalo burger, and good service.  The pub quiz is pretty hardcore (seriously - the toughest pub quiz I've ever attended, though I guess that makes sense based on it's location.  On the upside, it was funny watching the team next to us miss every single 'complete the lyrics' question.  C'mon, how can you not know the Cougar Mellencamp?!)<//Review>

This place has relatively good food for an Irish pub. They have healthier options, too. Prices are a bit on the expensive side, but then again this is a sports bar.

Every gameday, this place is a Seahawks meetup bar. You've been forewarned! (;</Review>

The place is decent especially at happy hour.But they always end up overcharging on something everytime i go there. Which means having to clear it up with them. Use cash if you can.< /review>

I came for watching the Soccer World Cup final, they charged a 20$ entrance fee and, differently from what they told me the afternoon before, this didn’t include a 10$ credit for food and drinks. They said “We changed it last night” (the event was at 8am). Highly disappointing.<//text>

Came here to chill on a week night to grab some drinks with co-workers. The olympics were on and i was pretty happy there were  This place offers a lot of foreign beers and I had to try one out.

The magnificient beer was called the franziskaner weissbier and it's from Germany. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I thought it went down nice and smooth.

Around 930pm the music became louder and the center area ws converted into a dance floor. Once that happened, the place became more grimey and I was ready to leave since I could no longer have a conversation without yelling into people's ears. I guess this is their way of kicking us out.</text>

The food is always excellent, and the beer selection never leaves me disappointed. Sometimes the service isn't ideal, but it is a solid Irish pub.</Text>

Food is pub quality with nothing special.  Beer selection is limited to about 6 taps.  Place is a bit musty and dated art this point.</Text>

<Text>Came here for brunch. Very underwhelmed by the food and service. Ordered the American breakfast, it was supposed to have 3 strips of bacon but did not. Eggs were also super oily and overall good was not that good.

Waitress didn't write down our order resulting in her coming back a few times to confirm what it was we ordered and us having to ask multiple times for items that we did order (drinks).

Not a fan and won't be back.</Text>< response>

(Translated by Google) It's a very nice Irish pub on Castro Street. The atmosphere is very good and it is also great to watch a game.
It has many craft beers to choose from.

(Translated by Google) Very nice atmosphere of Irish-American bar. Wide choice of beers, good burgers, frequent concerts, broadcast of US football maths and baseball, an old-fashioned counter. A good time to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of a good bar
