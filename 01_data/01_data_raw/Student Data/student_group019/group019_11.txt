< Review>
Dr Pietriantonio is a wonderful optometrist. I love that he is patient during the exams and wants to get the Rx right the first time. The front office staff is friendly and always helpful when picking out frames. They too are patient with me when I come back for multiple adjustments! I was having trouble with my latest lenses and Dr P took the time to check everything and is having my lenses remade due to a lab error. I feel like the whole staff really cares. I don't trust my eye care with anyone else.</Review>

The doctor is professional and on top of the latest  eye care.  My whole family felt very comfortable with him.  If you are looking for somewhere to get an eye exam.  Call them and make an appointment right away.<//Review>< Pictures>

I absolutely love going here to get my eyes checked! I have been going here since I was in Middle School and everyone is always so inviting and very generous. I had a hard time picking out glasses and the receptionists that were working there let me do a fashion show for them and their opinion really helped me to pick out a good pair. Amazing people, amazing service, and very helpful.< /text>

<text>Dr Jim and his staff are superb! I have had a great experience at his office. His office staff is friendly and professional and keep appointments on time. I've seen Dr Jim for years and have no reason to change. He referred me to my lasik surgeon, which was a life changer and recently handled an eye injury with compassion and quality care. I recommend Dr. Jim highly!</text><user>111648556984349912719<//user><Response>{'time': 1487379331947, 'text': 'Jeannette,\n\nThank you very much for your awesome review...we love having you as a patient at Los Gatos Vision Care.\nSee you soon!\n\nDr Jim'}< /Response><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Date>1484847706834</Date></record></dataset><record>

This was the worst eye appointment I have ever had. "Dr. Jim" came in and treated me like dirt because my insurance is not the top of the line. He began by shaking my hand and explaining that my insurance benefits are "horrible" and I should use my insurance for frames because I will get more out of it that way (I am a contact lens user). He treated me as though I was an inferior human being. Even down to the way he directed me to wash my hands and remove my contact lenses. I took out my contacts and I have very poor vision so I couldn't see the trash can-- when I asked where it was he pointed to the other side of the room and then pointed to the assistant standing behind me who was waiting to take me to another machine for some eye measurement. Then he rushed me and got extremely rude while conducting my eye exam. He rudely rushed me through the "#1 or #2" portion of the exam and was getting visibly frustrated when I was having a hard time deciding which was the better visual. I have never been treated this poorly by any human being let alone a DOCTOR. This man is horrible and should not be serving people in Los Gatos. His staff seemed timid and afraid as though they have been abused by his offensive nature for years. Dr. Jim, I hope you will learn from your mistakes and begin treating people with respect.< /text>

Run as fast as you can.  Customer service is horrific.  Watch out for the high-pressure sales SCAM - "your insurance won't cover old frames so you need to buy new frames each year."  When we found the same frames for $299 less down the street, we called back and they wouldn't match.  And, once your order is in, they won't cancel even over a Saturday when you know the lab hasn't even begun.  This must be one of the biggest SCAMS in LG with absolutely no customer service!  Just because we live in LG doesn't mean the vendors and service industries take advantage of the consumer!  LGV is one BIG SCAM!  Not worth the single star, but the only way I could post this general public warning.</text>

I have been a patient with LGOVC for 20 years and can attest that at lest twice I was saved from more serious eye issues by the staff here.  I trust them completely with my eye care and would recommend them to any one without reservation.< /review>

Absurdly long wait time and rude service. The food is pretty ok, but you have to order everything you want the first time. Adding to you order, like a desert or a second serving of a food item or drink, could result in an additional 45~60 minute wait. There is no English ordering-list so you will have to match up the numbers pictured on the menu or, in some cases, just guess. You're not going to get much help from the servers.<//review>

<name>Matt Wong< /name><Time>1551389925228</Time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) 2019 February 28th 10:30 Arrive at the Hyatt Restaurant, today a group of four people bunch, ordered 12 dim sum and three lunch specials
In about twenty minutes, A sister offered three dishes and six snacks. I immediately asked the waiter to send the soup and rice. After 20 minutes, the soup and the rice were still not available. I had to ask the minister and inform him. Still waiting for the white meal, and my lunch time is faster...
I have been waiting until 11:30. I am still waiting for the three-disc snack, the soup and the rice.... The fire is burying.
I immediately requested to pay the bill and pack it..... The ultimate waiter should pack the soup and rice, but still owe a snack.
11:33 Buried to leave. ... Total $85.61 Zero Tips 😡
I myself helped to open the peninsula, I feel that the peninsula is very good at serving the system... Who doesn’t know
"Nothing is worse, worse." I am really disappointed with Hyatt!

2019 二月二十八日 10：30 到達凱悦大酒樓, 今天一行四人食 bunch, order 了十二款點心和三款午膳特價小菜
二十分鐘左右阿姐奉上三碟小菜和六款點心, 我隨即要求侍應送上例湯和白飯, 過了二十分鐘例湯和白飯仍然欠奉, 我只好向部長查詢並通知他我仍在等候白飯, 兼且我午膳時間快過...
一直苦等至 11：30 我仍在等候三碟點心, 例湯和白飯....... 火都滾埋😡😡😡😡
我即時要求埋單和打包..... 最終人侍應把例湯和飯打包, 不過仍然欠了一份點心😡😡😡😡
11:33 埋單走人 ....... 總數 $85.61  零 Tips 😡
本身我幫襯開半島, 覺得半島嘅服務唔係咁好...... 誰不知
“沒有最差只有更差” 我對凱悦真的很失望呀！</text>< pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The food is delicious, the big feast is a drink, and the general meal is very suitable. Hospitality is kind and welcoming, although there are many guests, you can still enjoy a comfortable meal.

Always beautiful well done flower arrangements. This is now my go to flower shop. Flowers are always fresh and last awhile. They hand wrote my personal note in elegant writing and put in a wax stamped envelope for a very elegant presentation. Got the seasonal hand wrapped bouquet for my wife for a beautiful non occasion way of saying i love her. The bouquet came very elegantly wrapped. Definitely will recommend  this flower shop to other people who want a personal touch with their arrangements.< /review>

I had not heard of them before but read good reviews so I decided to go into the shop.  I was very pleased with the welcome I received.  Very personable, the hand written note and the red wax seal is a very nice touch.  Highly recommend House of Flowers!!<//Text>

I have purchased flower arraignments and plants for multiple occasions. Their flowers and plants are high quality, eye enamoring, and always earn compliments! Their customer service is 10 star worthy too, and they are very economically priced. This is not to say their creations are cheep quality, but that they are honestly a steal for how high-quality work they put out< /Review></record>

<text>I ordered an arrangement yesterday and it was received today. I recommend calling and giving a brief description or colors and of what you want along with price range and let them do their magic. This was truly the nicest arrangement I have ever seen.

A warm, unique, and picturesque shop with lovely mom-and-daughter owners. This good vibes only plantshop/florist/Bako-made items/and more is the perfect place to get gorgeous houseplants to fill your space. 11/10 definitely revisiting again and again and again....and again.

House of Flowers is my favorite florist and I wouldn't use anyone else. Their arrangements are beautiful and unique, no cookie cutter here! Their shop also has beautiful plants and gifts plus they do some great workshops and crafty classes for kids. My granddaughter loves them. The staff are friendly and helpful and I wouldn't shop anywhere else.</Text>

<text>My husband has sent me flowers from lots of places, however NONE have come close to the beauty that House of Flowers has delivered throughout the years! Every single arrangement  I have gotten from them has been breathtakingly beautiful! If you've ever ordered from a picture online, only to be disappointed once your flowers arrived, then you need to try House if Flowers! The pictures online are beautiful, and what arrives is exactly what you see or better!!!! Their vision and creativity is like no other! Thank you to the wonderful ladies at HoF, for ALWAYS surpassing my very critical expectations!!!!<//text>< user_name>

Last weekend they went above and beyond, and I am so very appreciative.  It was my daughter's winter formal, and long story short, she felt like the flowers were not the look she wanted.  This was late Friday night and House of Flowers had a large wedding on Saturday.  I was thinking there was no way that they were going to be concerned about a small bouquet of flowers for a high school formal.  Well, I was very wrong!  They contacted me Saturday morning, and told me that they would remake her bouquet.  They wanted her to be happy and knew it was important to her.  They were extremely pleasant about the whole situation, and her new bouquet was beautiful.
Thank you House of Flowers for your wonderful customer service!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful flowers and presentation made for a delightful experience. Loved the add on gift basket that made our gift of flowers feel so personal.

Not knowing what company to use when you don't live in an area is challenging. Leave it to HOF to do what they advertise!<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Worst experience. I’m not sure if they are racist or just lazy. Every time I go in there no one asks if I need help. After giving them a few chances thinking it was just a one time experience, it happened every time. Today my husband went in there. He was waiting to get helped no one ever approached him or asked him, after waiting for 20 minutes he just left.< /text>< Pictures>

The pricing was way cheaper than other shops I looked into - so I am just over the top satisfied and grateful.

Highly recommend House of Flowers for their professionalism, creative skill and wonderful customer service.  Our daughter's wedding flowers were perfect and just what she wanted within our budget.  They take any extra stress out of a big event by their authentic concern for YOUR needs.  Thank you, House of Flowers!!!  Oct. 18, 2014< /Review>

I ordered a bouquet online for my mom for her birthday back in September. The original bouquet that arrived was not what I had ordered, so I emailed House of Flowers and they responded immediately letting me know they would make it right. The next day they delivered a new bouquet that was absolutely perfect, more fresh, and looked overall like a better arrangement. I so appreciate them for getting back to me quickly and doing what they could to make things better. The new bouquet exceeded my expectations, and I will definitely use HoF in the future. Thank you for your lovely florals!</Text>

<text>We have ordered flowers from Diana & Amanda several times and i must say that the service we get is the always better then expected.  When the flowers are delivered they are right and on time. I would highly recommend them.
I have also had the pleasure of working with them professionally as the DJ and have always heard great complement from my brides and grooms

I'm staying at the hotel behind it and went searching for a place to eat. Glad I picked this place! It definitely doesn't look fancy but the food is incredible. Some of the best Indian I've had! The only downside is that since it is very small, the line for the buffet can get very long. I only ate my one plate because I didn't want to have to stand in line again.</review>< pics>

<Text>A great place for lunch in the area- possibly one of the best Indian buffet-style places around. Dishes change daily- their tofu, okra, and chili chicken are especially excellent. Indian milk tea is very tasty as well- just sweet enough, without being a sugar bomb.< /Text><Time>1347589984311<//Time><rating>5</rating>< gmapID>

Very good all you can eat lunch buffet for around $10. They have a good selection of vegetarian and meat dishes as well as delicious Nan and milk balls. The restaurant is a bit plain and cafeteria-like, but it is very clean and the people are friendly. I've been several times and will definitely go again.</Text>

<review>Taste is below par. Quality of cooking oil seems poor. I was going to give 2stars but my accompanying friend rates it zero. His grill chicken was so soaked in oil, he couldn't have more than few bites from it.<//review>< userid>

Hubby and I went with another couple and they ordered the garlic naan with their dinner and shared with us, it's yummy to. I highly recommend going for dinner, we had the place to ourselves.

<review>The food is great, at least to my American palate.  It compares favorably with Shilpa in Santa Clara -- same quality food IMO, sort of a miniature version.  The buffet setup is 1/2 as long, 1/2 the dishes, the eating area is about 1/4 the size.   Nan is left in the buffet but it's not always filled.  There is service -- they'll serve you drinks then leave you alone.   You shouldn't expect 5-star service at an Indian buffet, seriously.  Their mango lassi is a bit tart/sour, more of a yogurt taste than sweet mango/sugary if you like that.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I ordered naan, onion Kulcha, gobi Manchurian and two veg curries using UberEats. Curries were very salty and impossible to eat. Naan was cold like ice and Onion Kulcha resembled more like South Indian dish Uthappam. Worst food experience ever for me in the bay area. I recommend negative 10 ratings if available.</review>

I ordered Chicken Biryani in Sangam and I can say that the worst biryani on the planet . I decided to go with Lunch Buffet at least it would be better. Even, Lunch buffet is worst.

I can bet that no Indian can eat Sangam food.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Unforgettable Curry. The best curry I've ever eaten. Not spicy and sooooo tasty. In choosing a curry, you can be guided by the rule - the worse it looks, the tastier :) You can eat as much as you like (curries do not get fat :))

(Original)
Незабываемый карри. Лучший карри который я когда либо ел. Не остро и оооочень вкусно. В выборе карри можно руководствоваться правилом - чем хуже выглядит, тем вкуснее :) Можно есть столько, сколько влезет (от карри не толстеют :))<//review>

Pretty cool place. You serve yourself in the bowl with gloves and they cook it. They're very attentive and fast. Enough seating everywhere and they even give little extras when you sit down. I don't know what those fried things were but they were good. They have alcohol too.<//Text>

Recently just went and I could just say, it’s so worth it. For the price you pay you are getting a lot of food and it’s just delicious. They now grab all the ingredients for you and they fill it up. Lets support our local businesses during these times and go get yourselves some Mongolian BBQ!!!<//Review>

<Review>We came here for our friends 22nd birthday. The staff was super friendly, the food seemed fresh, and everything is super delicious. They have an amazing lunch special, $8.99 for a bowl, and you fill it as much as you can. I got beef and pork, veggies, and sauces. They add to your special, rice, sesame bread, soup, and beef wontons. I definitely suggest coming here for a nice and low key lunch!! So good.< /Review><Response>None</Response><user_id>100865904161117907650</user_id><gmap_id>0x80e829ad33ac9581:0xbb23eb0fde3d5bd6< /gmap_id>< Pics>

Been coming here for YEARS and it's still amazing! Staff is super friendly. We drive a bit far just THIS Mongolian spot, we'r have a different restaurant down the street where we live but just not the same service, freshness of ingredients or mood! Even my kids want only this spot ❤❤❤🤤🤤🤤🥗🍲🥣🍜🍽</text>

Make sure if your new you read their big white sign above the buffet about how to sauce and season your bowl.

<text>The food is good but the people who own it or work there have no personalities. They ask what you want to drink, then they never come back. Their children were running around yelling and just out if control. Also the sign says dinner all you can eat is $12.99, we were charged $13.43. If we eat there again, we will get take out.< /text>< Pics>

I LOVE this place. Follow the suggestions and amounts listed on the wall, and your food will be AMAZING! I love the family who owns it; they are very sweet. I suggest making a late lunch  or early dinner by coming at 3:30 or 4:00, to beat the rush, and still get all you can eat. The only drawback is they should have cafeteria-style trays, so the food placed in the bowls doesn't fall into the food bar and floor on the way to the cooking area counter ledge. People spill tremendous amounts of food on the way to the cooking station. It's not only a huge waste of food and money, but a major slipping hazard, so watch where you step!<//Text>

Not only fresh and healthy, it is superb with the wait staff quick to serve.   I'd give it a 5 star rating but it's interior decor goes wanting for a makeover.  (It's like a mix of an old pizzza shop and a beauty salon from the 1970s.)  That said, go for the BBQ.  Recommended.< /text>< response>

<Review>Poor experience overall. Food was okay at best and service was terrible! Upon walking in, we were asked how many and then just pointed to which side of the restaurant to sit without any further direction or acknowledgement. We went and found a table and sat down but nobody ever came by. After a few minutes of waiting and unsure if we were supposed to wait or start making our food, we got up and asked and a nod was the only response we got. After our group returned to our table there was soup and bread waiting but nobody ever came back to check in on us or take drink orders. The server even walked right by our table about 1/2 way though our meal (after bringing drinks to the table across from us), peeked at our table and then just turned and walked away. Once everyone was done eating and still no acknowledgement, my niece finally got up and asked if we could get some water for our table. Several minutes later, the same server that walked past our table about 30 minutes prior, returned with only one glass of water for a party of six!! Not to mention, that we still had to request water for the remaining guests, which took several more minutes of waiting just to get. It was hot outside, the inside of the restaurant was hot, not a single staff member checked on us (including the server), the food wasn’t very good, and we had to eat our entire meal without anything to drink. Definitely would not recommend this place!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Servers were very nice but it's kinda hard to eat when there's dying cockroaches around! There was a big one right next to our table that the server casually picked up and then another big one a few feet away. I can only imagine what it looks like in the kitchen :/ I'll stick to the one in Camarillo thanks!< /Review><user_id>107619097498413535652< /user_id><gmapID>0x80e829ad33ac9581:0xbb23eb0fde3d5bd6< /gmapID><Rating>1</Rating>< pictures>

<text>Love this place, my family and I have been enjoying dinner here for the past 8 years. Super friendly and awesome service. Family owned and operated. Always clean. Great food.
Lydia is so sweet, she recognizes us when we wall in, gets our drinks ready before we even sit down. And remembers our order.
Oh and they have the best oranges.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>5</rate>< date>

Good food, the service is... good, wells it amazing, just not very charming, but I'm might be nit picking. Also, I never really eat Mongolian food before, so I'm not too much of a judge, but I thought it was good, and its all you can eat for 13 bucks. Pretty worth it.</text>

Tasty and reasonable. You put what you want in a bowl and hand it to their chefs and they cook it up for you. Explore their sauces and oils that flavor the meat and veggies, some are better than others; I prefer the garlic and BBQ. A great place to come no matter the size of your party. They have something for every taste range from mild to "wow, that's pretty hot!"</review>

Cheap and all you can eat Mongolian BBQ! The good is fresh and cooked right in front of you to your preference. The service is polite and helpful. Surprisingly good selection of beer!< /review>

Everyone can find something to love here. Vegetarian options are fairly rare in Simi Valley but I am satisfied every time I come. Unless you LOVE eating a ton of food don't bother getting the all you can eat deal, just stack your bowl high and they also provide many different side dishes when you are done getting your main plate.< /Text>

<Review>One of the worst experiences we’ve had! We loved this place until today, while me and my husband and kids were eating we found nail clippings in our food! We then told the manager who was sleeping in the back on a couch about the nail clippings , she examined everyone’s nails and came to our table and said “you cut your nails?” She blames us for it then said this nail is “brown” ours are not she grabbed our hand and said see look brown mine no! I’ve never experienced this before! 🤬 I’m beyond annoyed and so upset she then walked away from me as I was talking and gave me a rude look ! I will not eat here again!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

There a reason this ups store is better review than the other one in town. From management to employees its night and day. Even location on north main street a bigger and better spot. Never get any attitude here, always professional.</review>

I had to send a number of large paintings cross-country and Mandeep did a great job of packaging them so that nothing was damaged in transit.  He even noticed that one package was delivered a day late and submit a refund request on my behalf.  Excellent customer service!< /Review>

<Text>I hardly send out or use the ups store, but this specific branch made it effortless. I needed access to fill out a pdf file form on the Internet and needed to print out the document due to my printer going haywire.

Christine was very helpful and courteous in assisting me with sending out the documents. I highly recommend this ups store to anyone that lives in the area.

Kudos to you guys thanks for an effortless experience and bar none customer service.< /Text><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

<Text>Management is a joke. Had a very important live scan sent to my masters program for school and the gentleman who was the manager at the time, gave me my receipt and and said it had been sent & accepted. 2 months later and my program has still not received the paperwork. Also this has not been the first time he didn’t take me serious, he usually tries to over charge me for copying paper.<//Text>< pictures>

<response>{'time': 1563902922400, 'text': "Hi Diego,\nI do not have any record of you coming in or calling with the issue of a live Scan. If there was a issue it could have been very likely a delay from the DOJ site. We are Live Scan provider and do not do the background check, what is means that we capture your fingerprints and submit that to DOJ and we do that while you are here before we even charge you for it. IF there is a miscommunication between the School program and DOJ then I am not sure how The UPS Store is responsible for that and as far as overcharging for copies then it's a same price for everyone. It's 20 cents a copy which drops down with quantity. IF there is any issue with your live scan then feel free to contact us @209-825-2000 and we will be more than happy to help. I am not even sure if you left the review for the right store to be honest with you."}</response><gmapID>0x80904034b2712a07:0x1029e95f61d48c9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service! Mandeep was able to help me send multiple things out that i really needed to be sent as an emergency, i didn't know there were options so i could get my packages to my destination at a quicker pace, Mandeep showed me everything and my packages were delivered on time! He helped me packaged my Fragile items so they made it in one piece. Thank you!</review>

Terrible, no sense of accountability, or honesty. UPS tried to deliver my package on a Friday while I was at work, they left a door tag that it would be held at this local store by the following Monday at 1300 - okay fine. I show up to the store to get my package and the supposed store manager has no idea where my package is and insists that I check the tracking information online and to come back as it had not been received. Next business day, I call first and a young lady proceeds to tell me (after shuffling stuff in my ear as if looking for it? Not sure.) check the website AGAIN because it isn't there. I over hear someone in the back whispering "is that the one for...'" and the rest is not audible. At this point I'm agitated and check the website while the gal and mystery guy chat about my 1200 dollar computer. Low and behold it shows it DID in fact get delivered to his store but was REFUSED by the receiver and marked as being returned to the original sender. I asked who was working during this time and the gal started stuttering so I asked to speak to the manger. He gives me some asinine explanation about the package being high value and would not have been delivered. BUT IT WAS AND WAS REFUSED by someone at his store. He starts rambling and mentioning everything not relevant to explaining how they made a decision on my package without consulting me first and at least giving me a chance to pick it up, high value or not. I would recommend taking your business to the other UPS store on Main Street in Walmart Parking Lot. They actually HELPED me and it's being delivered STRAIGHT there.< /Text>

{'time': 1509064968390, 'text': "Hi J.B  First of all I am sorry that you had to go through the hassle to get your package. This UPS Store has been in business for over 30 years and you cannot stay in business for that long without a accountability or honesty. We take a great pride in taking care of every single customer. There is a misunderstanding  on this package. As I have mentioned it to you before that nobody has refused your package, Unless driver refused it along with the other two packages(for a different customer)  that had been here for over 7 days and Exceeded the hold time. Access point  is a new program form UPS, where they reroute the  packages for customer who weren't home to accept it to the nearest UPS Store. The only role we are playing is signing for your package and holding it for you for 7 days at no charge. The package was never delivered here and it showed being refused by original recipient according to the tracking info.  Once again  I apologize for your inconvenience."}< /Resp>

<review>Everyone is very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. In a world where good customer service is a rarity, it is very refreshing to see that there are people out there that still practice it and are doing it well. Thehelpful attitudes are very much appreciated! Thank you UPS for making it easy!</review><GmapID>0x80904034b2712a07:0x1029e95f61d48c9</GmapID>< rating>

I have asked this question a few times and all I get is that there is no room for extra supplies.  I don't understand since this store is two times bigger than the one on the other end of Main Street.  The only reason I go to this location is because it's more convenient for me.  I have tried to calling the corporate office and keep getting hung up on.  This is not a very good business practice.</text>< Rate>

<Review>The place is clean but the prices when you aren’t the same. I bought papers today which normally is 2.50 at least for my boyfriend when he in comes .... but when a woman comes in its 2.50 + 3.35 (i did use my credit card but damn(5.85 for OCB king size organic papers) ) I’ll be buying my papers from Amazon now.<//Review>< username>

I was a huge fan of the spices used, as I like spicy food. I ordered the Hot Zigni Kei Wot. The part of the dish that contained corn was good; it was reminiscent of split pea soup (texture/consistency). The beef reminded me of ox tails (minus the bone and fat), which I tolerate from time to time. The greens were not as seasoned as I'm used to and the side bread that is unique to the Ethiopian culture reminded me of the bread that is unique and attributed to the Indian culture, but I was not a fan of this tortilla like starch.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTqrswN76vtI29UealsPgFEgCzNoEVd3jhQM2L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

<text>The food took a bit to come out, but what came out finally was AMAZING.  Do not miss this place.  We came at night, and all the tables were full but they made an extra place for us.  We've eaten at a few Ethiopian places now and this is the top of the list for me.  I don't think anything was pre-prepared and heated, I think they made it all fresh (which took time).  Don't miss.  Really nice people too.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Eiiiiiiiiii Red Red Red Sea ahhhhhhhhh!! Who's hands filled with so much love. Make delicious food like this. Nooooo if they are saying you are the best in Bay Area is ture. My heart is so happy all these different flavors. Yet come together in your mouth and tast so so good. This my second time I ate hear and still good. Lots of food and price a little high but where can you find food like this. The price i paid I brought food elsewhere and was so disgusting. I was so mad I cried!! But you ooooooooooo the price for such a treat fit for Nobals worth it. Keep good work and dont change. Mwaaaaaa a happy tummy is a happy human.< /review>< pics>

*sigh* I wish I lived in Oakland. The food here is so good it makes me want to sell my house and move to Oakland. Just kidding. But I do wish it wasn't so far. I only get to go if I'm in the area visiting family. The food is excellent and so is the service.< /text>

I happened to be in Oakland today and had a craving for some authentic Ethiopian food (there are no Ethiopian restaurants where I live now 😞) and I was happily surprised to find that the Red Sea was still there. We quickly found a park and with excitement made our way over to the restaurant. We were promptly seated and the waitress wasted no time getting us menus and glasses of water. We decided on a vegetarian family platter and I'll tell you what...the food was just as yummy as I remembered it to be 20 years ago. I was in heaven.  I'll have to come up with another reason to visit Oakland very soon😉</review><userid>107857461328637674490</userid><Time>1554262230009< /Time><username>Cheri H.</username>< Rating>

This is by far my favorite Eritrean or Ethiopian restaurant.  Their food has more of a home-cooked feeling.  I have at times caught a glimpse of the cooks in the kitchen and they look like Ethiopian grandmothers, so perhaps there is just love put into the food. Some of my favorite dishes are the Red Sea combo or the vegetarian combination.  It is also the only Ethiopian or Eritrean restaurant, I know of, that actually has a selection of seafood dishes, and if I'm remembering correctly they have one tilapia dish & two shrimp dishes.  My favorite part about this restaurant, would have to be the weekday buffet, which is incredibly deliscious and nutritious. It costs only $7.99.</review>

Loved it.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I reserve that for the incredible, and this was just excellent in all regards.  I've never had better at this cuisine.<//review>

I like the lunch buffet a lot. Good price, great veg and great non-veg options. Lunch is rather casual, dinner a little nicer.</Text>

I have been to countless Eritrean/Ethiopian restaurants throughout the Bay Area and in CA period. No place compares. All others should truly be ashamed of what they serve as "traditional" OR "tasty." I kid you not, this is as good as it gets. Best food ever! Huge portions, great ppl, great service. They are always friendly. I meet ppl from all walks of life whenever I'm here.< /text>

The food took forever and was cold. The portions were small. The service was awful. It was expensive. The live music should have been in the adjoining bar because it was way too loud for the small dinning room.<//text>

I loved the food. Next time I will ask them to cook it straight original style like the chef would prefer it, they admitted they toned down the spice level since we came in with kids. Very good flavor nonetheless. Strongly reccommend this place above all the other ethiopian/eritrean restaurants in SF/Oakland/Berkeley.  We have tried a bunch. We really tend to like eating in ethiopian restaurants that have more pungent and strong flavors, not mild and overly sweet to meet the Americanized expectations (like fusion style). Vast majority of them tend to really tone down their flavor to be more like fusion style and they turns out very boring to us.

This place is a gem ! Finally after all this time found a good one, Red Sea is great.!< /Text>

Great fast easy smog place. Because of covid you need to make appointment but they are very accommodating. Pricing was fantastic also. Mention google and you get a discount. Appreciated that.</review>

<review>I forgot my wallet! Regardless, Debbie at G&G let me do my smog check and let me pay after I got home. I appreciate their terrific customer service. That's going above and beyond. I'll remain a loyal customer.<//review>< pics>

Excellent service and very fast smog testing. OBD-II vehicles get tested in minutes, about as long as it takes to fill out the paperwork. Should have a really good system here and call my way to get over here when I need to smog test. It is a test only facility. And they also do the star testing.<//Text>

<text>G and G knows their stuff when it comes to smog tests. I had a difficult situation with a check engine light not wanting stay off and they worked to help assess whether my vehicle could be smogged. They offered me tips on how to complete drive cycles, and helped me through the registration process as a whole before ever charging me a dime. Their whole team is honest and straightforward and I am so incredibly thankful for my experience with them!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dcaa41a0d60eb7:0xa2cf259628dc7d24< /Gmap_id><Time>1540250212653</Time>< Rate>

Don't know why I always forget to write a review about this place. Every time I leave here I'm more than satisfied with the speed and customer service I receive. This is the reason why mom and pop is always the way to go, I support small business every chance I get. Thanks guys for all you do! A+ service<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Per the other reviews, these folks are honest, fast, friendly, and freaking good at what they do. I let very few people touch any of my cars ever, and G&G have always done right by me. Even when my Sidekick failed, I knew why (Vacuum leak causing lean = high NOx), but I asked anyway. Sure enough, without skipping a beat, they told me to scope out the EGR and vacuum. This is just one of many, many pleasant experiences. Knowledgeable, kind, and professional, I would highly recommend them. I personally won't take my cars anywhere else.<//Review>< pics>

Clean, friendly, and very quick! In and out in minutes. Went to another place first they jacked up the price, so I left. I'll be back to G&G from now on.<//text>

<review>First, this establishment is easy to see from the street and has plenty of parking.
Second, I was in and out in a matter of minutes. I was looking forward to waiting so I could read my book, however, I was only able to read a page and a half and before they were finished. I was there less than 5 minutes, I'm  not joking.
Third, I was a little disappointed that out the door with no repairs and 20% off it was still $48.
Amd finally, it was clean and they have some magazines and puzzles in case one has to wait.
I would recommend this business.</review>< Pics>

Worst I have ever dealt with. Failed. Was told high NOx due to bad timing and high idle. Charged $55.00.
Had it checked. Failed again. Told high idle, timing off and brakes bad. No charge.
Had brakes fixed and idle and timing checked again. Failed. Was told tps sensor was bad and needed a new one. No charge.
Replaced tps sensor, had timing and idle checked again. Failed. Charged $45.00.
What now? $165.00 (+tps) for nothing.< /text>

I called G&G Smog Test Only on a Friday afternoon and asked whether appointments were required. I was told "yes" and the. Asked when I would like to come in. I asked how far out they were booking and the person asked if I could come in now. I said I would be there in 20 minutes. There were just a few folks there already, but I didn't wait long at all. I waited inside in the air conditioned waiting room with a tv and I was probably in and out in 20 minutes, tops! Service was great and they were very friendly and were interested in how I had heard about them. Told them I had seen it on the internet and I got a discount for mentioning their internet site. I will definitely recommend them and will use them again.<//Review>

This company has the best customer service of any company I have dealt with, period.  The products are built to last, and are beautiful as well.  I did run into a snag with the delivery company and customer service at Poly and Bark resolved it,  following up to make sure all had been resolved.  The free shipping and return policy  makes it a stress-free shopping experience.
I've furnished much of our new condo from Poly and Bark - so happy to have found them!  I highly recommend them and would give them more than 5 stars if I could.</Text>

<Review>We’re very happy with our leather sofa and ottoman. We were initially hesitant to purchase online after researching and all the positive reviews sold us. We’ve had them for 5 months and they still look great, we get plenty of compliments and the pieces offer nice comfort. Shipping was effortless.</Review></record>

<text>I purchased a leather ottoman a few months ago and am so happy with the purchase! The quality is fantastic for the price point. I have 3 kids ages 5 and under, so we are not exactly gentle in furniture, and so far this is holding up and wearing really well. Very happy with the purchase!< /text>< gmapID>

We ordered two beautiful couches!  They are well made and came safely boxed and were easily delivered.  We opted not to have them unbox them for us, but the setup process was very easy.  The couches are sturdy and comfortable. So far we are very happy!</review>

The company was great to work with on multiple occasions. We had an issue with our bar stools and they simply replaced them after seeing what had happened. We have gone on to order a couch and two chairs. They are amazing as well. Good work to the whole Poly and Bark team!<//review>

This company far succeeded all my expectations! The quality of the dining chairs we ordered were incredible. We get compliments on the constantly when we have guests over! The customer service and shipping times are also worth raving about. We ordered 8 chairs and they all shipped so quick! I had one chair come in with a scratch and they were so helpful and replaced the chair immediately. Highly highly recommend this company!< /Review>

I’ve made several purchases with Poly and Bark over the past year or so and have been very satisfied with both their products as well as the overall customer experience. Their products are high quality, affordable and arrive quickly. They are great with returns and responsive to service requests. When I am looking for a née piece they are always my first stop!<//review>

I also love that it can be extended to accommodate our big families and yet it is so sleek and modern to fit our design aesthetic.

<text>I ordered a leather square ottoman for our lower level. It was so easy to order and was delivered in a very short amount of time.

This company provides the perfect balance of price, quality, and risk.  I never thought I would buy a high dollar item off the internet such as a couch.  Poly and Bark provided me sufficient detail to make a decision and a money back guarantee to minimize the risk.  At the end of the process, I was wowed by the accuracy of the product information and their wonderful customer support.  These guys and gals get it!<//text>

<review>I wish we could give them 5 stars. If we could it would be that we love the table and it is a great price for solid white oak and for the size. It was exactly what we were looking for.
However, after ordering and receiving shipment notification and tracking, the wrong table was delivered to our house. We had to wait a few weeks for the table to be picked back up, and then several more weeks for the correct table to be re-shipped to us. It took a lot longer to receive the correct table than the incorrect one that was first sent to us. We reached out to Poly&Bark hoping that they would do something to make it right and they just kept replying saying to check the status of the shipping. After we opened and assembled the correct table, we found a deep gash in one of the sides of the table (approx 3 inches by 1 inch). But because of how long it took to receive, we didn’t want to call and mess with taking apart, shipping back, and waiting for yet another table to be sent to us. So we decided to just live with it. The finish/top coat on the table almost immediately started coming off which has also been disappointing. We are glad it is solid wood though so that we can re-finish in the future when we decide to. The table is solid, super heavy and durable. We love the extensions and that it can be 10.5 feet long for dinner parties. We like it, but there definitely were disappointments along the way.<//review>< pics>

We purchased Poly & Bark's Sequoia Ottoman a few months ago, and have been very satisfied with the look, feel, and quality. We had to wait a bit for it to come back in stock, but once it was and we submitted the order the shipment was fast and came in perfect condition. Overall a great experience!< /Text>

<text>The chairs are sturdy, durable, comfortable, and easy to clean. They look nice. The only problem we have is that the top finishing layer comes off around the sides of it. And i have no idea if there is a way to fix it, cover it up or stain it.. They look worn in just 5 months.

Update: I contacted Poly and Bark about the chipping issue and sent them a photo. They immediately sent me new chairs saying that the chipping is not typical with these and could be defect or something. I will see how the new chairs hold up. They sent them for no charge! Wow<//text>< Pics>

I bought a dining table from Poly and Bark. It arrived in excellent condition, well packaged. It was so easy to assemble, I was able to do it myself while my partner was working. The table is solid wood, looks just as was described. The price for solid wood can't be beat. I will absolutely buy from them again in the future.< /Text>

<Review>I ordered the Geneva 43" Round Dining Table with brass legs. The shipping was excellent. And I really love the brass base and the style. The size is also perfect for 4 seats. My only complaint is that the veneer on top is VERY thin and not resilient. We treat the table normally; we aren't animals! And I use a warm, damp towel to wipe it clean after dinner. But the veneer has started to flake in multiple places. The worst is a seam in the wood, over which the veneer was laid. That slight uneven surface created a line. Photos attached.< /Review>< UserId.>

<text>Questionable quality and overall bummed with some significant buyers remorse on this purchase. Received a Girona sofa in March 2020 and the legs of the couch immediately stained our rug, leaving two large orange stains. Customer service is pleasant but slow to respond (but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt due to COVID), and told me to scrub the rug to remove the stains. After renting a carpet shampooer and scrubbing more times than I can count, the stains are still there. We also noticed lack of quality in the cushions quickly flattening and the leather looking especially worn (while I know this is typical with leather, it happened pretty quickly). We regularly rotate the back cushions to try to mitigate this. Recently, my partner tried to flip the seat cushions to fix some of the "sag" issue. While doing so, the cushion cover zipper completely snapped (We've had for a year. We have no pets, no kids, no guests bc pandemic and this is the first time we touched the zipper). I wrote Poly and Bark on March 28th, and was told today (April 21st) I could pay an additional $220 for a new cushion - no other resolution offered. I have asked Poly and Bark if they can address any of the issues (stains, sagging cushions, poor quality, broken zipper) and will update if they respond accordingly. Overall, pretty disappointed in spending $1800+ on something that we will be attempting to repair for the meantime (purchasing foam for cushions and taking cover to a tailor) and then replacing at some point in the near future.

Edit: after posting, I was contacted by the CEO who said they'd replace my rug and the cushions. Cushions take ~12 weeks to ship so will update this review when they arrive.< /text>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I have bought a few items from Poly & Bark and am always SO pleased! The style fits our scandinavian vibe. My favorite pieces have been the Kurva Floor Mirror and the Casablanca Area Rug. For the rug being white, it has held up pretty well in our living room. The mirror is so chic and I love the curved top. We also bought the weave chair in white and it is super comfortable! The pink/white pillows in the photo as well are also from Poly & Bark. They were really nice at first, but we have a dog and his collar has gotten caught on the pillow a few times/the white is not as crisp anymore. I am definitely a huge fan of Poly & Bark and will continue to buy from them as we need more pieces in our new home!</text>< pics>

Love, love, love my Poly & Bark Napa sofa! I agonized for months about this purchase and so glad I finally pushed the send button. The sofa arrived within the estimated delivery date. Super easy to attach the legs. It is the centerpiece for my living room that I was looking for.
Very comfy too, my hubby loves napping on it.</Text>

<Review>I couldn't be happier with the sofa we purchased from Poly & Bark. It is truly exquisite. We opted for the Girona Velvet Sofa in Distressed Green Velvet. I had requested a fabric sample before making the purchase and I was very impressed at how high quality and beautiful the material was. It's an incredibly comfortable sofa on top of being a beautiful accent in our living room. It was packaged extremely well and the entire shipping and delivery experience was simple and convenient. This was my first time buying a sofa online. It is a bit nerve wracking to make such a big purchase without seeing the complete product in front of you, but I encourage anyone on the fence to go for it! Take advantage of the free swatches if you're having trouble deciding on a color/material.</Review>< user_id>

While putting it together ( which was not hard at all ) I somehow lost track of a few screws and because I couldn’t find them, I assumed they had not been delivered, so I called the company and their CS guy - delivered an excellent service ! I hung up the phone totally happy with the solution he suggested - yet a few minutes later I found the missing screws so I called them back and thanked them anyway - it had been my mistake !

I have been absolutely thrilled with our left-facing Napa Sofa.  The leather feels so good and the couch is super comfortable.  We had to wait a little while for it to come back in stock because it was so popular, but it was worth the wait.  You get what you pay for!</Review>

< Review>
We had an excellent experience with Poly and Bark. We bought a leather couch. It’s gorgeous, the quality of the leather is excellent and the padding and pillows are very comfortable. We have had it for 4 months or so and there is no wear visible, even with a cat and dog jumping up and down on and off of it. We expect it to last a very long time.</Review>

<Review>We bought a couch which is made from good materials, but is quite uncomfortable to sit in because you can't sit with your feet on the ground without it hurting the lower back, even though we are tall people.  When we reached back out to discuss with PolyandBark, they completely ignored our emails, so there was no discussion to be had from their side. I was surprised because their brand suggests that they will be very good to work with.<//Review>< Pictures>

We love the leather couch we purchased from Poly & Bark.  We were debating what kind of couch to buy for our great room and decided to give a leather couch a try.  We were hesitant at first because we have dogs and kids but figured that since the couch was not overly expensive (compared to other leather couches) we'd give it a try. Buying any type of furniture online can be scary because you can't sit in it and get an overall feel for the furniture but we are very happy that the couch was exactly what we expected and more.  We purchased the Napa and love the single seat cushion.  It is very comfortable and so far has handled dogs and kids really well.  We expect that this couch will be a favorite and last us a very long time. The shipping/delivery was also timely and didn't take long even during Covid-19.  Very happy with our purchase and will likely purchase from Poly & Bark again!</text>

<review>Got the Rowan chair in Cognac and the Truro bed.  The chair is bigger and comfier than expected and the bed was easy to assemble and you can pair with all kinds of alternate cushions if you're not into the leather options on the site.
Excellent delivery experience and the quality is really, really good for the price. Compares well to similar items from other retailers that are way more expensive.</review><name>Amy Endemann</name>< Gmap_id>

Great quality furniture, especially for the price. The sofa is as comfortable as it looks and the chairs, bar stools, and lamps I purchased are great! Last mile logistics was kind of a let down as there was one back ordered piece that held up my order a two weeks, but overall I'm happy. Customer service was great in coordinating with them to get the available pieces out on the next truck.</text>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>I purchased a rug through Poly & Bark and that process was swift and seamless.  Since that went well I ordered a leather chaise sofa too. So similar to one I’d been eying for years on Article, but much cheaper.
I love my sofa but getting it wasn’t the best experience. It was back ordered and I was left wondering where and when in the world the thing would be showing up. I had to contact customer service a few times to ask for updates. Eventually they did get back to me but the process remained mysterious and hard when I had to track down my item with the XPO company that seemingly lost my order. It eventually arrived about a month later than expected.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

We LOVE our sectional, bar stools, and rug from Poly & Bark.  We get nothing, but compliments on them.  They are so stylish, yet durable enough for our family including our 100lbs Bloodhound.  Poly & Bark is now my go to for our furniture needs.<//Review>

Well, I love their designs overall. They sell products at a good price and the quality is great as well. I ordered a rug last year and received it within a week. I thought that was pretty cool since we were in a pandemic year.</text>

I've had a lot of communication over the last year with multiple orders and I have nothing but positive things to say. While issues did arise with my orders (delivery delay that was out of Poly & Bark's hands), customer service was extremely helpful and they did absolutely everything they could to fix the problem and went above and beyond my expectations. While the product I purchased (the Napa sofa in black onyx leather), was TOP quality and I am extremely happy with my order, the overall experience with this company will make me be a lifelong customer.</Text>

I purchased the Napa sofa in cocoa and it is so pretty! The company was quick to communicate with me about delivery timing and customer service was responsive to all my questions. The couch is super high quality and is exactly what I expected from the photos. Really great experience shopping here!</review>

Poly & Bark customer service went above and beyond when the freight delivery company “lost” my couch. They followed up with me daily, worked with the freight company on my behalf and were ready to ship out another couch, if needed, no extra charges for me.

The couch itself is beautiful, comfortable and seems sturdy. I would 100% order from them again. (The freight company is a different story)<//Text>

I purchased a rug through Poly & Bark and that process was swift and seamless.  Since that went well I ordered a leather chaise sofa too. So similar to one I’d been eying for years on Article, but much cheaper.
I love my sofa but getting it wasn’t the best experience. It was back ordered and I was left wondering where and when in the world the thing would be showing up. I had to contact customer service a few times to ask for updates. Eventually they did get back to me but the process remained mysterious and hard when I had to track down my item with the XPO company that seemingly lost my order. It eventually arrived about a month later than expected.</Text>

I purchased 3 chairs so far. Two dinning chairs have lasted over 5 years and still in great condition. A newer leather chair for $800  purchased last year looks great and adds texture to our living room. They deliver on time, and the items look exactly like you expect. I would put them in a comparable quality bracket to west elm.<//review>

Fantastic price for a gorgeous couch, that came quickly and easily. Everything about the shopping experience was easy: when there was a hiccup in trying to pay with the third-party installment plan (they don’t let you charge that much as a first time user) I got fast direct attention from P&B. I adore the couch, super high quality at a price that literally couldn’t be beat. Shop here!<//text>

Customer service was great and the ottoman is beautiful. I have 2 small complaints:
1. Many of the products were out of stock for months
2. When my ottoman arrived, it came with small spots that looked like water specks on them. it’s a leather ottoman so I figured it will get weathered overtime anyway< /Review>

<Review>Poly and Bark make quality pieces. I had been eyeing their Napa leather sectional for quite some time, but it seemed like a significant investment. When I shopped around for similar offerings and realized the value they provide in their products. So we bought it essentially sight unseen, relying only on the positive reviews we read. Maybe we're crazy to spend a few grand on something we haven't seen, sat or lounged on in person, but we took the risk and it paid off big time! We also purchased the Oviedo coffee table from them after being disappointed in a similar offering we got from Article since P&B were out of stock. Oh, and they offer free shipping! That's a huge deal when you're buying a huge sectional in GA that ships from CA! All in all, we are incredibly pleased with our Poly & Bark pieces and the overall buying experience.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80e8332bc016902d:0x23c15588c53e5916< /gmap_id>< Rate>

I was super nervous about buying a sofa online but Poly and Bark had the beautiful style that we love at the right price point for our budget- This sofa is artwork. It's truly beautiful, stylish, comfortable, we are in love with it. Customer service was above and beyond helpful. Very happy. We will be ordering from them again for sure.< /text>

Really steep discounts on everything in their store. We found a sizeable tear in a couch we were just looking to try out. When we told them, they knocked 50% off of it. Wait was a bit long to pay but we didn't care. It was Sunday and we just picked up our dream couch. No delivery, but they connect you with a team that normally does Poly and Bark delivery. Got it the same day.< /Text>

I love my sofa!!! I was skeptical about ordering a sofa online. I researched for weeks and read reviews. I was pleasantly surprised when my sofa arrived very quickly and it was perfect! I can't say enough about the quality, the comfort and the beauty of the leather, not to mention the wonderful leather smell! I could not be happier. If you are looking for a stylish, modern leather couch, you can't go wrong with Poly & Bark.<//review>

<text>I did a ton of research before buying a couch, so glad i choose this one. It is not ridiculously squishy but definitely enough to be very comfortable. I fall asleep on it all the time. It was shipped with a small tear and poly and bark are sending me a replacement of a cushion and it was so easy to request this. They're customer service is awesome.

also the couch is beautiful :)</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I had been searching for globe pendant lights online for a few hours trying to decide on a set for my piano showroom. I came across a set offered by Polly & Bark for a pretty reasonable price. I needed 10, so price was a factor. To be honest, I wasn’t expecting much. I was blown away however when they arrived. They looked great, and were much more substantial and higher quality than I had anticipated.  Very pleased. Will definitely look to them for further design purchases.< /review>

We absolutely love our couches. Modern looking  but yet VERY comfortable and deep. Multiple friends and family have asked us where to get them once they sat on our Poly & Bark  Napa Sofas. The 82 incher can be super comfortable, even for a TALL person.<//text>

We love our couch! However, it gets delivered in 1 giant box that doesn’t fit through a standard door frame. I live in a apartment and I had to take it apart in the alley and carry it piece by piece by myself because the delivery drivers just dropped it in the alley due to the fact that they couldn’t fit in through the door.</text>

Ordering and communication was fantastic! Our couch arrived perfectly packaged and was a breeze to put together. The only issue we had was with the company who delivered our couch- we are located in Georgia so maybe touch base with your delivery companies in regards to customer service. But we love our purchase!<//Review>

This was definitely a God send. I’m well pleased with the quality of their products. I ordered a couch a throw and an ottoman. I love the way it’s aging. It was the best addition to my modern style decor. I looked extensively for a replacement couch after what I was told was a leather couch started peeling on me. Everywhere I looked was canvas leather but not poly and bark. There’s nothing like the real deal leather and that’s what Poly and Bark provide. I tell everyone I know if you need quality products about my experience. Now I’m just waiting for them to start selling the Segovia glass top desk again my collection would be absolutely complete and perfect.< /review>

We waited for the sofa to come back into inventory and swooped it up! It arrived in a massive box that they brought right to the front door. We unboxed it ourselves and brought it right in. It goes together in minutes, the careful unboxing took longer.

Its perfect. The leather is buttery soft. We have had it for 5 months and we have a big dog and a little dog who each damage fabrics in their own way.  But not this leather! It is strong and it just looks better every day.

We bought it over the summer and these pictures are at Christmas< /text>

We love the leather couch we purchased from Poly & Bark.  We were debating what kind of couch to buy for our great room and decided to give a leather couch a try.  We were hesitant at first because we have dogs and kids but figured that since the couch was not overly expensive (compared to other leather couches) we'd give it a try. Buying any type of furniture online can be scary because you can't sit in it and get an overall feel for the furniture but we are very happy that the couch was exactly what we expected and more.  We purchased the Napa and love the single seat cushion.  It is very comfortable and so far has handled dogs and kids really well.  We expect that this couch will be a favorite and last us a very long time. The shipping/delivery was also timely and didn't take long even during Covid-19.  Very happy with our purchase and will likely purchase from Poly & Bark again!</Review>

I just love my new couch from Poly & Bark. It shipped and arrived when they said it would. It was super easy to assemble and arrange in my house. I had been looking for months for a new couch and nothing out there really fulfilled what I was looking for and most everything was final sale or had a large restocking fee. The biggest reason I was so pleased with Poly & Bark was because they have a 30 day return policy where they pick up the furniture if it isn’t right. Luckily this couch is perfect and is so comfortable! It looks great and is good quality! This will be my first stop next time I need new furniture!< /Text>

Poly and Bark has been amazing! We have a Napa Sectional, Luca bench, and Riley round marble coffee table. We are in loveeee with our furniture! Also, we had a small thread poking out of the couch cushion that was fine, but we were concerned with time would pull and cause an issue. I chatted with Poly and Bark customer service and they sent a seamstress to my house within the week and it took him 1 minute to fix it. They have been amazing and the furniture is high quality and beautiful looking. So so happy we chose Poly and Bark!< /Text>

Packaged very well, easy to set up.  Ordered black; however, this color is more of a charcoal gray in my opinion.  The black rug I have is much darker than the couch, kinda of a drag.  They look great; however to sit and watch tv or work on your computer, it is not a comfortable couch.  The back cushions are very easily 'smushed' up but in general, just not supportive.  I wouldn't recommend this particular couch, but their other options may be better.<//Review>

Customer service was top notch, particularly for an internet sale of a sofa being shipped to Cincinnati during a pandemic.  Sofa also excellent.  Top marks.<//text>

I ordered a leather couch and an 8x10 rug. Both items were delivered faster than expected, which was awesome. The items I ordered (about 3 months ago now) are beautiful and well made. I love them. The reason I’m not giving 5 stars though is because of the customer service email correspondence. When I received my couch, there was a 5 inch tear in the bottom of the couch’s dust cover. Not a big deal, and thankfully nothing that affects the overall cosmetic or functionality of the couch (something I mentioned in my email). But I did pay for a couch in new condition, and felt that bc it wasn’t delivered that way, I should receive a discount. The person I spoke with replied with something like : dust covers are easy to replace, here’s an amazon link to purchase a new cover. That was it, no offer to even pay for the new cover (it was only $10). Thankfully, I continued the conversation and asked for compensation, to which they responded they’d give us $100 off.
So in the end, I felt like it was resolved. But I am disappointed with how they handled it initially. They should’ve offered a discount right off the bat, with a suggestion to replace the cover.< /Text>

My leather couch and chair are the focal points of my living room.  The customer service was second to none and I had great communication from the shipping company and knew exactly when I could expect to receive my items.  I hadn't shopped at Poly and Bark previously but have since recommended them to many of my friends and I will be a return customer.< /review>

I recently purchased a leather ottoman for my personal residence, and I love it.  The legs that came with it were a little too high for my furniture, and they were nice enough to send me shorter legs at no additional cost. They go above and beyond with customer service and I will be buying many more things from them in the future.

I LOVE my Napa sofa! The cognac tan leather is beautiful and even when it gets scratched it just adds to the distressed look. Very comfortable, dog-proof, and way more affordable than similar couches I found online (trust me, I searched them all). Fast delivery as well. Very happy with this purchase!< /Text>

We LOVE the couch we ordered from Poly & Bark.  The cognac color is beautiful and true to the picture.  We were nervous about how comfortable it would be since we could not try it out first, but we were NOT disappointed.  It is super comfortable and looks great in the space.  I accidentally ordered the wrong angle, but the customer service was quick to change it for me, and the correct couch was delivered.  The delivery process was a little strange in that you get an alert when it is delivered to the distributer nearest you - it still takes a few days after that for you to receive it.  Again, customer service was quick to answer that question for me.  Also, Poly & Bark uses Instagram influencers to advertise their products - just search the hashtag and you can find some pretty great coupons/deals.

All in all, highly recommend Poly & Bark for products and customer service.< /Text>

Poly & Bark had the perfect faux leather bar stools...although they look and feel like real leather.  I loved that we could order 3, which is what we needed.  (On some websites you had to order bar stools in pairs.)

Absolutely amazing product and service. Delivery was fast and easy and we are so pleased with our couch. Easily looks like double the cost in quality. Has a vintage look to it without the rough texture. Leather is extremely soft and stays cool to the touch. Perfect nap couch :)<//text>

< Review>
I got the weave (also known as wishbone) chair from Poly&Bark. I chose them because they offer one the best price points for the high quality products they have. Even though I made the order during the peak pandemic week, I received my items super quickly (just in few days!). 2 out of 6 chairs were slightly damaged, but hey showed a great customer service by sending me new ones (again super fast). Definitely recommend this company to everyone!!!</Review>

Great experience and will definitely be making more purchases.  After waiting for my nightstand to come back in stock, COVID has slowed everything down, it arrived quickly once ordered. I couldn't be happier with the quality and price.  We are using it as a side table in our living room and it is perfect between our chairs.  I was torn between this nightstand and a similar but twice the price model at a competitor.  So glad I chose Poly and Bark.</Review>

<Review>Poly and Bark is great. I bought the Napa sectional in midnight and the Sorrento sofa in tan and also my daughter bought the Napa sectional in tan.  We obviously love their products.  The leather is excellent especially for the price and they look awesome in our homes.  They are very comfortable as well. I tend to fall asleep watching TV.  The shipping was much faster than I expected for a large item.  The assembly is extremely easy even for me a senior. The pieces are lightweight for large pieces.  The only issue I had was because they are lightweight they tend to slide when you sit down not very gracefully but that was easily fixed by putting furniture cups under the feet.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80e8332bc016902d:0x23c15588c53e5916</gmapID></record>

I got the weave (also known as wishbone) chair from Poly&Bark. I chose them because they offer one the best price points for the high quality products they have. Even though I made the order during the peak pandemic week, I received my items super quickly (just in few days!). 2 out of 6 chairs were slightly damaged, but hey showed a great customer service by sending me new ones (again super fast). Definitely recommend this company to everyone!!!</Text>

Great experience and will definitely be making more purchases.  After waiting for my nightstand to come back in stock, COVID has slowed everything down, it arrived quickly once ordered. I couldn't be happier with the quality and price.  We are using it as a side table in our living room and it is perfect between our chairs.  I was torn between this nightstand and a similar but twice the price model at a competitor.  So glad I chose Poly and Bark.</review>

I got my leather couch from Poly and Bark and I love it! This couch is very similar to the one on Article. The price was also very similar. Delivery took about a month due to COVID-19, but well-worth the wait. Once the couch arrived to the delivery center, they contacted me and schedule my delivery for the week. The couch was delivered inside a box and set in my entry area. They took a quick photo of it inside my house and left then I unboxed it and it was perfect.</Text>

Poly and Bark is great. I bought the Napa sectional in midnight and the Sorrento sofa in tan and also my daughter bought the Napa sectional in tan.  We obviously love their products.  The leather is excellent especially for the price and they look awesome in our homes.  They are very comfortable as well. I tend to fall asleep watching TV.  The shipping was much faster than I expected for a large item.  The assembly is extremely easy even for me a senior. The pieces are lightweight for large pieces.  The only issue I had was because they are lightweight they tend to slide when you sit down not very gracefully but that was easily fixed by putting furniture cups under the feet.</text>

< Review>
I bought the Argan leather sofa from Poly&Bark and I’m very pleased with my decision. The real leather is very soft to the skin; my 3 month old baby scratches the heck out of the leather with his sharp nails (if you have babies, you’ll know how fast and how sharp their nails grow ;)), the marks were gone after a few days. I receive a lot of compliments from everyone who visits the house.  Plus, you cant beat the price and the 30 days free return. If you have baby/toddler and afraid of having a white couch, this is the one for you!!!</Review>

Our leather is not coated with any toxic or harmful materials so it's a great choice for homes with pets and kids.  We also recommend using otter oil or wax to massage out scratches.  But even without, your sofa will develop an amazing an gorgeous patina with time.  We hope you and your family enjoy it for years to come!"}< /resp>

This was my husband and i's first big "splurge" purchase for a household item that didn't necessarily needed replaced but rather, something that we really wanted to help style our home in a way to matched our decor design. This couch is 'joy," it brings the space together perfectly! I felt confident purchasing knowing I could return it if I didn't like it or I could replace it with a different style, all for free. During the newness of the pandemic, with everyone still shut down, we were able to seamlessly shop and purchase this couch online. Delivery was as easy as a phone call to set up a date and time. My young boys played in the cardboard box for days and my husband and I enjoy the luxury of a beautiful leather couch. I used lotion protector recommended by Poly and Bark to ensure the couch was properly protected, I have had no issues, even when the boys use the cushions to build forts. I love looking at it every time I walk in the front door!!!!< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>We purchased the Napa sectional sofa from Poly & Bark. For fear you don’t read my entire review, let me just start off by saying, P&B furniture and customer service is absolutely phenomenal!!!

During transit, there was some slight damage that resulted in the two pieces of our sectional sofa not aligning properly. On a side note, my daughters then proceeded to melt chocolate into the leather, accidentally.
I contacted P&B customer service and explained our situation, not really knowing what they could or would be willing to do. After talking with them, P&B decided to send us a replacement sofa and arranged for the other sofa to be picked up and shipped back. On top of that, for our troubles, they gave us store credit that we put towards the purchase of a Luca leather bench.

Their efforts to make sure we were totally happy with our purchase went above and beyond. We absolutely love our sofa and bench! The craftsmanship and quality is top notch and so to is their customer service.</review>< pictures>

My wife is the most special person in world to me and she deserves the BEST experiences in life and this is exactly what we felt with Poly & Bark which is why I'm writing an novel of a review...

She wanted this specific couch for a long time, and would always beg me to look at getting one from Poly & Bark. I, naturally, would play hard-to-get, but finally I caved. One late evening, after a few drinks haha, I just ordered it for her (not with any stimulus money either :P). She was literally dancing around, hugging me, kissing me, and now we are pregnant with our 3rd. Ok, jk, we are not pregnant, but she probably peed her pants with excitement.

Come to find out, they were sold out again, hah!  However, I called the next day to see what the turn times would be, and we were met with the most polite, genuinely kind team member on the other line. They went above and beyond and as far as checking current stock (physically in the building) and they ended up having one on hand! We felt incredibly taken care of and we felt like VIP's with them. I'm pretty the name of the person we spoke with was "Angel" and how fitting of a name, right?

The couch arrived really quickly thereafter, assembly was a breeze, and now our living room looks like most Blogging, Studio McGee loving-mother's-living rooms. Justin Bieber would say, "Swag, swag, swag."

In all seriousness, the couch is comfy, very lightweight and the quality went beyond our expectations, especially with the price. Thanks to this couch, we are now pregnant with our 3rd...Ok, another bad joke.

Incredible experience from start to finish. Thanks Miss Poly and Mr. Bark! :)<//Review>

<text>I purchased 3 chairs and a glass table. I love the design however both scratch easily and the chairs do not fit under the table if you try the paint of the chair will scratch off easily. If they made a few adjustments like.. Make the table a little taller, thicker paint and glass protection..it would be perfect.< /text><user_id>117847923748881284624</user_id>< name>

We were finally able to purchase one of there constantly sold out Napa Leather Sofas. We purchased the Cognac Tan Nappa Leather Left Sectional. Although I was initially a little nervous since I had never ordered a piece of furniture so large or even without looking at it, the experience was great: The sofa arrived quicker than anticipated (10 business days) and it was delivered by XPO logistics (I've had a good experience using XPO at work as well). The sofas packaging was fantastic. Fully protected with foam and additional padding in a Poly and Bark branded box. The sofa itself is as amazing as it looked. . As soon as you open it from the box, the amazing smell of that sweet sweet Napa leather will fill the room. The leather is as soft as you'd expect, and of good quality. The sofa itself is nice and comfy, it's not sink in soft nor is it overly firm.  The legs come in a nice bag inside the bottom of the sofa that you just screw on for assembly then you snap in the two sofa pieces together. Takes about 5 minutes to assemble, it will probably take longer to get out of the box. We've has the sofa for only a few months now, but it's still going strong. No creaking, or flattening of the foam. I'm excited to see how the couch patinas over time.  From the experience I had,  it looks like Poly and Bark has the "buying furniture online"  thing figured out. I recommend them. Especially if you have been eyeing one of there cognac tan sofas.< /Text>

The leather is beautiful and the couch is very comfortable! It is definitely our favorite hang out and napping spot! I will say the leather scratches very easily, we embrace it as character and most buff right out. The light tan leather might not be the best color choice if you want your pets to sit with you!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<name>Amanda Glass<//name><Text>We bought the Napa sofa and loveseat in chocolate about two months ago, and we have been very pleased so far! P&B was responsive from the very beginning of our purchase, and the sofas arrived exactly when they were expected to. The leather feels quality and looks beautiful! We loved the look of the cognac tan, however with pets and a baby we went with a semi-alanine option for better resistance and I’m so glad we did.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Even in the midst of the craziness of the California wildfires in the fall of 2019, Poly & Bark was committed to both excellent customer service and taking care of their employees. They communicated the situation of the fires, their desire to have their employees stay safe, and their desire to deliver my sofa as promptly as possible. I appreciate such professionalism and care.

PLUS my sofa is better than I hoped it would be. The leather is a gorgeous color and feels fantastic - not too hot or too cold as I've experienced with other leather furniture. It is comfortable and fits all three of us and our standard poodles who think they are lap dogs.

When I need more furniture, Poly & Bark will be at the top of my list to consult.<//text>

Love, love, love!  Always nervous about ordering furniture online without being able to sit, feel, touch - but I am SO glad I did!  The couch arrived very quickly and was everything I hoped for.  It is comfortable but easy to sit in and stand up, you don't sink too far into it while still getting the comfort.  Leather always has variances, but I did feel like one of the cushions was too dull and didn't look amazing with the rest of the couch, I reached out and they immediately gave me options and ended up sending a new pillow cushion which I received right away, even with COVID 19 delays.  So happy both with the product and the customer service!< /Text>

Since our leather is all natural and not chemically coated scratches and scuffs will occur.

<review>Purchasing process, phone support, delivery and all is super. Sofa looks amazing, is comfortable, love all about it. But it does scratch up so easy. I mean, SO EASY. I did read about that before I bought and a lot of people are saying it's part of the charme of it and they even have their dogs on the sfoa and such...so I am trying to trust the process, but I am right now, 3 months in, still freaked out a bit. Even picking up something from the sofa causes a mark....from a short fingernail type....< /review><rate>4<//rate>< pics>

We bought four light fixtures and there were great, but ended up needing the return them (the needs of our project changed)... i was worried that returning would be a crazy process or that we'd lose money but it was so seamless and in the end they even gave us free return shipping... i will definitely shop at Poly & Bark again!</text>

I got the Lyon Sofa in Cognac Tan. It is exactly what we are going for in our living room. The plan is to get two of these sofas and create a cozy conversation space. I was hesitant to buy 2 at first since I wanted to get the touch and feel, make sure the color was as pictured, etc. My mistake! I am on the waiting list to get a second one in December! We love this sofa.</Text>

I recently ordered a couch from Poly & Bark. Their prices were competitive and customer service was responsive & helpful. They shipped my couch out the very next day after placing my order. Shipping was slow, but that's not their fault, & they warned me ahead of time. The people who delivered the couch were very friendly and kept me up to date when they were running behind schedule.<//review>

I just recently purchased Poly and Bark couch the tan color one. I must say my guest can’t stop talking about how deep rich the distress leather is and how it feels sitting on it. A great buy for the price and glad I found this couch on line.< /text>

<Text>We're super happy with our Poly & Bark Karen chairs, which go beautifully with the dining table we purchased. The experience of purchasing and delivery was super straightforward, no hassle--and having gone through a whole thing with another retailer once, I can't overstate how appreciated that is.

But most noteworthy is their customer service. We ordered two sets of chairs--four total. The first set arrived in perfect condition. The second set had a small defect on one of the chair arms (the paint was scratched off). When we contacted Poly and Bark, the rep was efficient in addressing our problem and sent out a replacement for immediate delivery, again, with absolutely no hassle.

Experience matters when it comes to brand--as much as product itself. And these guys really nailed it on both fronts.<//Text>< user>

Simple and stylish design company that has helped us outfit our new home in a way that feels like us...without breaking the bank. They were great answering questions before we made a purchase, communicating with us after our order and through shipping, and have appropriately followed up to check in on how everything went. Great experience from beginning to end. In short, we'll be shopping with them again very soon!<//text>

The rug I bought from Poly and Bark was not only perfect for my mid century modern farmhouse, the price was much less then what I would have had to pay at PB, CB etc.  When I wanted to return it for a different size, the customer service representative respond right away. Even better yet... shipping and returns are free!! I highly recommend you check them out!<//Review>

I ordered a tufted bed from Polly and Bark. It came supper fast, I was surprised with how great the quality was, and how easy it was to put together. The customer service was also very friendly and helpful in helping me choose the right fit. Overall really happy with my purchase.</text>

I chose a low pile rug to go in our high traffic (filled with 3 kids) living space and it has been the best move! Truly! It cleans seamlessly and adds so much character to our space not to mention they're super affordable. I love Poly and Bark and plan to shop with them many more times. To see how I styled the Poly&Bark ruh in my living room, check out my instagram @theancar.abode ❤< /Text>

So I’ve had my sectional for 1 week now and it’s the cheapest material ever! I feel like I was ripped off. You would think it would be better quality since you paid an arm and a leg for it. Super disappointed!!!

Was told that my sectional was going to get here anywhere from 1-5 pm and now it’s past 5PM. There is no sense of communication whatsoever.</review>

<username>Billy Lloyd<//username><Time>1562189353672< /Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Great couch and chairs and rug I purchased. No issues with the items. My issue was with the delivery. I had ordered it prior to moving so it would arrive soon after moving in, the customer rep told me they would put the shipping on hold until 06/12 to ensure it arrived when I was there. However they didn’t do this and it caused a large delay and many calls to figure out what had happened. Everyone was friendly but I was disappointed that they dropped the ball on the shipping. And the delivery guys just drop the couch in a box in your house, they don’t take it out, and they don’t remove the very large box so you’re forced to throw it away on your own which is annoying. I though PandB would’ve given me something for the shipping fiasco but nope, just a sorry.

REVISED -
Post this review, one of the owners of P&B contacted me to personally apologize and make it right. Which they did - and now as of yesterday - we have in hand 4 beautiful milk globe pendants for our mid-century house - at a incredible price!

I am impressed in the product, and now impressed at the personal service and P&B making the effort,

Bravo+Thank you!

------------------------------
Received my online order of 196$ 4 lamps and opened the box to find the items are clear instead of frosted as we wanted. I double checked and after a heck of a search found the pay-pal receipt stated clear (even though I am sure we had ordered  milk/frosted).

I contacted customer service to just return the 4 and buy 4 frosted ones shipped right out.

" So sorry but we do not do exchanges. " They then advised me they would charge me 48$ to return the 4 clear lamps.

That says to me as a customer - It is not a good idea for me to order anything else from poly & bark in the future.

Disappointed first time customer.<//review>

<time>1537666343852<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I was SO excited when my husband and I found a light fixture for our new house. I purchased in May and received a confirmation email. Then two months later I hadn’t received any updates or information about my order. I emailed the customer service and they responded that my item was on back order and that was noted on the confirmation number. At this point I wasn’t too concerned because our house wouldn’t be done until September. I was a little annoyed because literally the only indication that is was on back order was a tiny light grey “estimated ship date.”  So when the “estimated ship date” came and went without any update I emailed the customer service for a second time. I got a reply that the new ship date wasn’t until JANUARY 7th! Again I received no other updates from the company. I had to follow up with them to receive  any information. When I called to cancel my order because I didn’t want to wait an additional 4 months, the woman just said “okay”. No other questions as to why are you cancelling, what can I do to help? It was just okay. So then I explained my frustration with the company and she was like “sorry, I will share with my supervisor.” I was like, “you know what I would love to share with your supervisor as I am in customer service and it sounds like this company could use the feedback”... her response..”no it’s okay...” I did eventually end up hearing from her supervisor and that supervisor handled the situation very well. I will however, not be shopping with them again as I waited 5 months just to find out I wasn’t getting what I ordered.
