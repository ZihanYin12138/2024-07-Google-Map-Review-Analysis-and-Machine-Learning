Daniel is unpleasant. I said a quart then immediately corrected to a gallon.  He misheard and prepare a quart instead of a gallon. Dare to blame me and suggested I speak louder. Then forcefully required that I must purchase the error.  I remembered why U don't shop here. I'll never go back. I only went there to recycle paint.   Sherwin region manager, Steve, called in response to this posting.  He asked and listened to my story. His response was sincere and he offer to remedy.  I change my rating from 1 to 3 stars.<//Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>The first minute a customer walks in they are subconsciously generating impressions of overall service. In the couple minutes I was there I was not greeted, when I went to ask a question everyone stalled. There was two employees behind the desks in the back, why didn't they care to help me? The only person who tried to help me was ALREADY HELPING ANOTHER CUSTOMER. Of course my inquiry wasn't at the top of my priorities, but he answerd my question two times with the same answer, "yeah but it's in the back." The effort wasn't there at all on anyone's part, and the leadership today was non-existent. Seriously you guys??

It is christmas eve doordash took my money so to a place that was closed. I ordered through slice under the impression it was delivery. I realized its pick up only I called the store these people at this location are absolutely the most amazing beautiful people they chose to deliver to me out of the goodness of their hearts knowing what I was going through I could not recommend any other pasta place before them. Oh and the food was actually really good but the service I'll forever eat her< /review>

E saw people hauling giant boxes out of this place and wanted to give it a try.  We got the giant pizza thinking it would be fun, but more gimmicky than actually good.  We were shocked at how great the pizza is!  Everyone was excited to see the huge pizza, but then were all amazed by the actual quality - terrific pizza and a lot of fun!</text>

I grew up eating Mike's pizza in my old neighborhood. This second location is family owned and operated as well with the freshest food made to order. I like to go in the store and order rather than delivery. It's good to see a small family business making their living and they make sure all you order is how you like it.<//Text>

<Text>Uhh... Flashbacks to a terrible Pizza Hut order...

I'm not sure what this is? Is this normally how your pizzas are here? Cardboard thin, 16" for $20? Thanks for the snack, I suppose. I'll go back to other local shops instead.</Text>< pics>

Youd expect the giant pizza to taste like cardboard. But, its fantastic. The crust is great. The prices are comparable. We've never had a problem here. The guys are always so nice and always offer to help me carry out to my car. The excellent customer service is what stands out the most being that there are a ton of pizza places like this. Definitely worth it for me!</Text>

<Review>My family and I very much enjoy ordering the delicious giant pizzas. Their non pizza items such as chicken wings (classic and boneless) and fish and chips are also tasty. I recommend this place to all family and friends plus all future cumstomers.< /Review><user_id>100310629415729062696</user_id><time>1558393471734</time>< Gmap_id>

<text>My experience here at Mikes New York Giant Pizza was amazing. They have been under new ownership for the past year and half but I must say the pizza is still the best in National City.The ingredients are still incredibly fresh and the pizza is always cooked to perfection. The employees are so welcoming and friendly: always offering new recommendations and specials to accommodate my family. They have the best chicken wings that I have ever had! I recommend you try this place. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!<//text>< user_name>

I just ordered some food from this restaurant through doordash! 15 minutes after my order I got a call from the doordash driver telling me that the restroom did not have half of the items that I ordered!I then suggested some replacement items at a slightly higher price and was told by the restaurant that I would have to pay the higher price!in my opinion I should have gotten the replacement items at the same price as my original order due to their incompetence! I was able to cancel this order but now I need to wait 5 to 7 days before I get my credit card credited!now I'm out on my credit card balance of the $24 order for 5 to 7 days and the restaurant is out nothing!!! I will never order from these people again!!!!< /Text>

I ordered one pepperoni and jalapeno pizza and one mushroom and jalapeno pizza. Too much cheese, not enough sauce, and about 2 jalapenos per slice. I ended up throwing away the leftovers.</review>

I don't expect much from new york as a city. The pizza lately is how I expect it to be in NY. Over all, the service has always been friendly and better taste than the big name pizzas in the area. 3 and a half stars, 5 when the birthday party kids' eyes light up when they see the giant pie!< /Text>

<Review>Don't believe the hype,  Don't order the 3 topping deal it is a rip off.  The pictures online are deceiving, they look good and full, when I received my pizza and got home I had to laugh, I could of taken all the topping from the whole pie and put it on one slice and it still wouldn't of come close to the pictures online.  They have a 1 topping one for $5, I was hungry and tricked by the pictures.  I should of done the math,  $12.99 for 3 topping and $5 for 1,  So I paid $7.99 for 10 little pieces of sausage and 4 very thin slices of onion,  this place is a joke.
And really people, the ones that say this is as close as New York style pizza you can get, obviously haven't been to NYC.  I live in NYC and it is nothing close to it,  reminded me of old Dominos from the 80's.  It wasn't the worst that I have had but it really wasn't great.  I wouldn't ever order again.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

We've been here 4 / 5 yrs ago, and the pizza was delicious. Staff is still as friendly as it was then. The pizza we had the other day was decent, flavor was still good, jus not as cheesey as it was back then. But we will return.< /Review>

<Review>We just ordered 2 calzons they came approximately 14 inches wide with no toppings or fillings what so ever. It looked more like a flat bread with a slice of pepperoni and cheese. The ricotta was hard and tasteless. They didn't have any mushrooms on a Saturday night. The service was horrible and on top of that when we called in to complain the "gentleman" that answered the phone was rude and outright disrespectful. We asked to speak to a manager which hadn't been present for the past 2 hours. We then asked to speak with anyone in charge at the moment and apperantly no one had any idea who was in charge so they handed the phone off to some young individual. He began by saying no one here is in charge but I'm talking to you and when I stated that these weren't calzons he told me "do you wanna come in and show me how to make a calzons" which I thought was not the right response to give to a long time customer.  This was by far the worst experience I've had at any pizzeria. I've tried to contact a manager a few times prior to this experience and he is never in so I am personally going in on Monday to speak with him in person. If the manager is not present or declines to speak with me my next step will be to speak with the owner.< /Review>< pics>

<user_id>112284984277052000953<//user_id><review>Doctor Nick was what I expect from a customer over. Great staff, clean office and rooms, didn't try suggesting work that didn't need to be done, gave quite a few options on the work I did need done. Sad to know he has retired, he will be missed. I just retired from owning a plumbing business since 1977. We both worked for retirement and earned it. Good luck Dr. Nick. Enjoy. I do.< /review>< pictures>

I have always had  such anxiety about going to dentists ever since a very bad experience as a teenager, but from the very moment I called them to set an appointment, all the way through the process to actually having the dentist work on my problem, I felt everyone there cared about the job they were doing along with me and what I was going through.
A huge thanks to doctor Nicholas and his team members!
I never thought I’d say this but I actually look forward to coming back to  the dentist to address issues I’ve put off  for years concerning my teeth.
Thanks and be safe!</Review>< username>

<review>Dr. Lessenevitch has always and will always be the best dentist for my family. My son goes in like a champ. My daughter not so much, but Dr. refers her out when work needs to be done, instead of creating an unnecessary fear. Now my baby girl knows he has her back, which had eased her nerves. Since she knows he is the no pain DDS. she will let them do cleanings now. This is what building trust looks like!</review>< Pics>

I'm so happy to be back with Dr. Nick and his team. His receptionist rocks by being kind, and providing good information (so helpful). He also has the BEST dental hygienists. Dr. Nick is great by not trying to gouge one's pocket. I have had bad experiences at other dental offices, but not here. Thank you so much for your services! 😁👍🏼< /text>

<Text>After retirement it's about 250 miles round trip to see this dentist. Those miles aren't even scenic, but the experience is worth every one of them. The staff is professional and courteous. They make you feel important and the efficiency is beyond compare. When I tried to see a dentist closer to home, they wanted to replace my fillings because they were "old".
Dr. Nick doesn't perform unnecessary work to make an extra buck. He treats his patients with respect and ensures each visit is a positive one. You don't spend excessive amounts of time in the waiting room and you get what you pay for, great service.</Text>< Pictures>

Everybody that works here treat me with the upmost respect. It is a very relaxing environment. I had a lot of trauma from visiting a different dentist as a child, but this place made me love going to get my teeth checked again. I will continue to go there for as long as they are in business!< /Review>

I can’t say enough positive things a out Doctor Nick
And his staff.  Doctor Nick is a very caring and skillful
Dentist who spends time explaining what treatment is necessary and those which are elective.  Then, his wonderful  staff takes over and works with the patient to make decisions based upon your financial situation, willing to work out a plan which fits into your budget.
The office is clean and pleasant. There is never a wait and they work on a very efficient schedule. I highly recommend this office to anyone. You will be very pleased with the experience.</text>

Once a patient of Dr. Lessenevitch and you will not be able to go to any other dentist. I travel several hundred miles to see this dr and believe me this guy has saved all my teeth. He makes it impossible to be happy with anyone else.< /text>

Dr.Nick's been our family dentist since 1996, all 9 of us!  We like his approach to dentistry. He's kind and takes time to explain procedures and our options when discussing treatment. His hygienists, chair side and front office staff are professionals that are well trained. We've had several visits over the years. Full disclosure on October 2017 I came to work in his office. Thankful for his expertise and kindness to his patients and in particular my family.</Review>

I am so over the moon pleased with Dr. Nick and the entire office staff.  They are very patient focused and do everything they can to accommodate the patient.  I especially appreciate that they will call if they have an opening sooner than my scheduled appointment to ask if I would like it.< /Review>

Dr. Nick is a miracle worker!  He has a broad knowledge of all aspects of dentistry and can solve problems I know no other dentist could do.  He's been faced with many challenges dealing with my teeth and always has a solution.  He's been my dentist for almost 30 years and am glad he's my dentist.  All those in his office have become like family to me and are dear to my heart.</review>

<Review>Broke my denture and needed it fixed fast.  I called about 11:00am and she told me to come in right at 2:00pm.  I did showed the dentist my plate and they recommended that I get an alignment to save problems later since I had cracks in another section of the plate.  They said I could give it to them now and hang around for a couple hours or leave it over night and pick it up the next day at 2:00 pm.  I left it and they called at about 11:00 the next day and pick it up.
They were all great and made sure I knew that they were there if I had any problems.  Thanks for the great service.  Oh and they gave me a discount!  How great is that😊</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Doctor Nick is wonderful! Sadly due to my employment my insurance changes so I cant always go to his office.
However, he's fixed teeth other dentists said couldn't be saved. He's always respectful and listens to your concerns. If you don't understand something he will take the time to fully explain it you which a lot of other offices lack.</review>

<text>Very professional. Had tooth pain and was looking for help and Ms.Kim was being an absolute angel over the phone. She sensed my anxiety and was able to calm me down. I was seen the same day and I did not have a wait time longer than 1 minute after I filled out my paperwork. Dr. Nick and his staff made me feel like it is ok to be scared and when I left the office I felt taken care off and treated like a human being.
First doctor to not tell me to "suck it up" or "quit being a baby".
I highly recommend this practice to everyone in need of care. They are upfront about cost and they won't force you to do treatment you don't want to do.
My absolute favorite dentist.
I have dental anxiety and he handled it very professional.
My first positive experience with a dentist in 34 years. I'll keep this one 😊</text></record></dataset><record>

Called in on a Thursday morning at 9 a.m with pain in a cracked tooth they were able to schedule me the same day at 11, the staff were amazing and polite, got a root canal and the pain went away instantly. Two days later still no pain and I'm very thankful to Dr Nick  and his team. Oh yeah and Dr Nick is very good at what he does with over 35 years exsperience, he's got it figured out. Put your teeth where they get treated rite and give Dr Nick a call. I wish I could give 10 stars this dental office is that good.</text>

<review>Very caring. Called in the evening with a tooth ache and they cared enough to accommodate me the next morning. Very professional, office was clean, the entire staff made me feel welcomed. My usual dentist in Beverly Hills will not be seeing me again as I have requested all my dental records transferred to Dr Nicks Office.  My tooth ache was resolved and I am very pleased with the outcome of my visit.
Thanks once more, and we appreciate your continued presence and good work in our small community.<//review>< Pictures>

You the bread is fresh and when the Concha is fluffy and soft! Good taste, fair prices for size of bread and friendly. Lots of locals attend.</Text>

love the bread always fresh but you have to know the time they came out of the ovens. the sweet bread goes very fast but the boliyos go faster.</review>

{'time': 1562375986235, 'text': 'Hello Vanessa! I want to start off thanking you for coming into our business and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. However, like several other businesses, we try to push out all of our products in the order they were made. We do not sell "old" bread, that is our motto. Our bakers work around the clock every single day, baking twice or even thrice a day,  to guarantee freshness. As for the flies, we are 100% sure that the "flies everywhere feasting" is slightly over-exaggerated since we have many devices in the building to try prevent specifically that from happening. We are always striving for better ways to improve, so we kindly thank you for pushing us to do just that! Again, I apologize for your bad experience and hope we are able to make it up to you during your next visit! Thank you!'}<//Resp>

Bad service how they going to tell you what bread you going to get.. I was going to get some fresh bread and they told me no to get the old one first.... and flys everywhere inside bread outside with no cover while the flys feast on the breads...<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The bread is very good but the service is very bad. A customer merchant always respects himself if the seller had a bad day for the customer, he should be kindly treated

Can't rate the balloon. Didn't ride it. However our tour guide Amy was great. As well as the other staff members. Part of our party was late getting there but the other guide made sure we met up during our tour. Oh and don't get the nachos the cheese is cold.< /text>

This ride is very gentle and goes up to 400 ft in the air. This is a great ride for the whole family as any age can ride on the Balloon. If they are 12 or older they can ride alone, as long as the waiver is filled out by an adult. Under 12 years old a parent must accompany the child. The employees are very kind and helpful. It's tethered by a cable going up and down like an elevator. It does sway a little if there's some breezy wind passing through but it's calm. It's filled with helium, yes helium like a regular balloon would be. It's also wheelchair accessible if your wheelchair fits the gondola doors. If it doesn't fit they do have thier own wheelchair in which one can transfer into. Once in the air you can see the whole park and animals you don't normally see on the tram. Also depending on your membership level you may get a discount.<//review>

Looks like fun but I'm scared 😨of heights.
It goes pretty high so you can overlook the safari park< /text>

Definitely worth the $20 plus you will never be that high and something that's just floating and subject to the wind movement and other people's movement in the balloon with you, Great experience!<//review>

<review>Lots of fun and shockingly inexpensive relative to other add-on safaris offered by the park. $18 per person, in Dec 2018. Ride length is about 10 mins and they let you walk around once at the top. Very friendly staff, but slow iPad-based waiver form process at ticketing which some people really struggled with.<//review>< pictures>

Bought my first airsoft gun here, workers were extremely nice and explained everything I needed to know. When my gun broke (not the store’s fault, the manufacturer sold them a defect) they explained to me what was wrong and fixed it for me for a good price. These guys know what they’re doing.< /text>

<Text>I have become a regular here since getting into Airsoft.
Friendly staff, good product selection. Definitely a one-stop-shop.
Really good selection of AEG's and pistols. Lots of gear too.

Expect potential for a small line on weekends, as the store's capacity is only a few at a time during COVID.

Just note their website stock status does not necessarily reflect that of this particular physical location, so give them a call and they will be happy to check if they have an item.</Text>< Date>

< Review>
Came here to get my first full setup of gear after borrowing and only playing once or twice a year for ~6 years.

The guys who work here were extremely nice and easy to work with. They didn't guide me too much but were there to answer questions I had and were ready to answer those questions in depth.

Overall I was very comfortable, very happy with the products I got, and ill be going back for a second gun whenever the day comes that I need a second.

The only negative was that they were out of stock on batteries and battery chargers when I got my gun so I had to go elsewhere for those. My one piece of advice when going here is to call ahead to ensure they have what you're looking for in stock - if they do then I would highly recommend going to the store as it was a good experience<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Walked in not knowing much about Airsoft guns, and walked out with a good starter gun at a great price. Customer service was some of the best I have experienced in a longtime. They took the time to explain the differences between the guns and showed me the best ones for a beginner. They showed me all the features and how to use the gun. I was also able to test fire the gun at their firing range.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>I PRE-ORDERED some gear through the website and went through the card verification like the company asked to "protect against fraud". My order was then canceled days later and when I call to ask why it was cancelled they tell me that they didn't have anymore inventory and the don't hold items ON A PRE-ORDER! I'm then told that the card wasn't verified until Monday morning when I sent in the verification on Friday afternoon and was told the shipping department probably didn't see it because they had gone home even though I sent it at 1:30PM. Avoid the headache order with Evike instead they at least TRY to fix the situation if they make a mistake instead of brush it off and say they can't do anything else to help the customer.<//review><gmapID>0x80dbff9707ddef83:0xeb3d4a16c5149d98<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Spent the money to Polarstar my Airsoft gun only to walk out without testing the gun myself. Customer service was great but they did not have the necessary items for me to test my Airsoft gun out after spending a pretty penny.< /Text>

Came here with my partner and we had a fantastic time! The staff was nice and the rental stuff was easy enough to figure out. The only thing was the other players were very very rude, and I told one of the refs, but he told me it was part of the game. I'm not sure that's the game I want to play. Anyways, I had a great time and my partner had a glorious time, I would come back any time, but I will request to not be group with as*ho*es next time.< /text>

<Review>I feel they are very honest with their work and recommendations, and they do want to help you walk out with a great performing airsoft gun. They will not try to sell you parts that don't contribute to improving your rifle. Great group of slightly nerdy staff who really know their stuff, they are also knowledgeable on all rules and regulations involved in this sport.<//Review>< resp>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Some days it can be packed for such a small store, making it take a while just to grab ammo but they are the only one in SD. Good prices, and great selection in guns. I've had an order take a while do to lost forms, but this is an isolated incident and they didn't charge labor. Overall a good store, but lacking a bit in part selection and number of staff.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Very positive experience!  Lawrence was awesome!  As a regular firearm shooter, I was looking for a way to save money on ammunition and still get semi-realistic training.  Based on my requirements, he pointed me to gas blow-back versions of my weapons, which provide the recoil (albeit minimized) and realistic round count that I'm used to.  He let me test fire the weapons to get a sense of their feel and behavior.  I'm in!  I've already talked a friend of mine into trying out airsoft with me because of my experience at Airsoft Extreme San Diego with Lawrence.  I will definitely be making my purchase from AEX.<//Review>

Very bad customer service and the sales guy and the manager have a very nasty attitude. Also they lie. I once bought a g&g rifle and with that deal they made the bbs price cheap and when I went next time I got another rifle that was a g&g and they said that brand doesn't come with deals. They try to rip you off. I don't suggest anyone buying from them. I would suggest that you drive to Los Angeles to better stores there.<//review>

I love airsoft extreme. Their staff all know what they're talking about and are always helpful. Product selection is great and if they don't have what you need they can get it!<//Review>

<review>The people here are very nice and knowledgeable about airsoft. They know what they are doing and help me find what I need whenever I go there. Their customer service is great and the people who work here are friendly. Their inventory is stocked with essential equipment for airsofting along with a large complement of weapons to purchase there.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>I needed a hopup bucking to upgrade my DMR so I chose this company because it was the closet one near me. Transaction was good but during delivery the parcel needed signature required. Of course I wasn’t home and missed this. So I had to wait until the weekend until I could get.

I understand if this was a gun or if it is too big to fit into a mailbox but why they couldn’t of just dropped this small, tiny, 1 inch item into my mailbox? Or leave under my door mat? If you ask me, this was a complete waste of my time!</review>< Pics>

Just getting back into airsoft and bought an ak74 from them. Tryed it out that night around 6 and it wasn't feeding correctly and the mag jammed to the point where it didn't work I called in that same day and they were almost closed so I couldn't come.back to return it. Came back the next morning right at 11 and the gun was shooting fine using their battery and mag but still wasn't shooting well enough for me to keep it and I had to pay a 15% restocking fee!!!<//review>

<review>Everything I buy here never breaks they have guality stuff for sure most the staff is friendly there's is 1 member who is rude though
And seems more money hungry than the rest .. but regardless place still has great merch I recommend shopping here. Just don't come to get your guns fixed they most likely lie just to get money from you and do research dont get recommendations they will lead you rite to the most expensive item even if it doesn't match your gun it's sad but just get what you want and leave cause its quality</review>< pictures>

<Text>Compared to dealing with Evike issues this place is a 6 star.

Other than the fact that I have gone in for a battery and left with a hi-capa it's awesome! But seriously, the best place in Southern California for HiCapa parts. Lawrence and staff know their stuff.< /Text><Name>Scott<//Name>< pics>

<Text>This is definitely a great place to get airsoft gear. There's a wide selection of guns and parts. It doesn't take long to find what you need. The customer service was amazing! The guys working there were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. You just needed to flag one of them down as it was quite busy there. Regarding the reviews that had bad customer service; maybe they've improved since then, or maybe you just came in on bad days. Contrary to logic, try coming in on common busy days such as Saturday, you'll probably avoid the "bad" workers with all the customers they need to service.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Awesome place to go for airsoft guns. I bough a 1911 green gas blowback for $95 and my friends cost $120 and he thinks mine is much better quality. Awesome place if you are just starting airsoft or buying  500-600 fps sniper riffle. Really cheap too. Has everything too a beginner or advanced airsoft player needs.</text>

<review>I've been going to AEX since summer of 2013. TJ, Dave & Laurence are all very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or a veteran, they will always point you in the right direction. I stop by the shop at least twice a month to say hello and pick up a few things. Great products, great service, great people, AEX is my go-to place for anything airsoft related.

P.S. The AEX brand rifles are the best bang-for-your-buck guns on the market. They are phenomenal out of the box, and with minor upgrades they are just unreal.</review><UserId.>110046687036460031128</UserId.>< gmapID>

Great Airsoft store, it's pretty much the only one in San Diego and that's just fine. I've been to the big 3 Airsoft stores in Los Angeles that everyone talks about ( Evike, Airsoft Gi and Airsplat ) Evike probably once a week or so and it's a nightmare compared to AEX. And while AEX might not have EXACTLY what I want when I want it, they usually still have what I need just a different brand and or price.
There is a lot of inexpensive airsoft gear out there that looks great online only to buy it and have it shipped and find out it's just utter garbage that looked good in the picture so it's great to have a store stocked up with parts that you can look at and feel in person.

Anyways, Good work AEX

<review>The Store and staff rock at this place the only problem i have is that the store is super cramped there is always a ton of military wanna bee kids hanging out in there which doesn't make help with space. other than that store was recommended by a family member and i would never go anywhere else.<//review>< Response>

< Review>
Terrible customer service! They don't even know what they're talking about, I, a 15 year old know loads more than the people at AEX who do this for a living! And they act as if they hate their lives, and they are very lazy. They sometimes got what you need though.</Review>

Abolutely very difficult work with these guys.  Updates are vague. No Heads up. Rude and unknowledablevon the phone. They are good at leaving you in suspence.

This place had great customer service! Heads up..they hinted for me to go get some "coffee while I wait" at the little store/restaurant next door to them..there on the counter was a coupon for my smog!! Saved me $$ and got me out within a hour. Very nice.< /Text>

Have had 2 cars within the last couple of months require Star-certified smog check. Pep Boys recommended these guys, who got me in and out quickly, the first time without an appointment, and with a hefty discount.  Will always use them in the future.<//review>

Awful experience. I bought it on Groupon to be smoged and I drove 40 minutes so I could save 30 bucks and the employee tells me, "I'm not doing anymore groupons, I've done like 20." So then I had my sister call and complain. And he told my sister, "I don't care." Awful.<//text>

<review>The owner is awesome! I called to see if they were still taking customers since it was 20 minutes til closing and he said if I get there within 5 minutes he could do it (I was only a mile away)... and i got every red light imaginable! So I was 5 minutes late and he still took me in! I was thrilled since I work a 9 to 5 job. Great experience! Will definitely recommend!</review><gmap_id>0x8090543bed7f74af:0xb502d07470978a8< /gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Great experience! Wonderful service. Friendly staff. I walked in without an appointment, there were three people ahead of me, and I was out of there in less than half an hour. This was the first time I had to get my cars smogged. Smogs Unlimited was fast, friendly, and painless. I would definitely recommend anyone who needs to get their car smog checked to go there.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

In a bind got to the place before 5 pm to find out it was closed.  When hours clearly state that opened til' 5pm.  Then on google states closing soon.  Might be a good idea to update or have a fb oh wait this was also not updated.<//review>

Don't come here. They have no idea what they are doing. Completely incompetent, they failed my truck twice because they don't know how to use a timeing light. It passed with ease the first time I took it somewhere else. Don't waste your time going here.< /text>

<Review>It was quick. The price I got from Groupon was reasonable. ( $20 ). I was surprised at the $10 certificate fee charged on top of the voucher price, but it's ok. I got in early so I didn't have to wait long to get done.<//Review>< Time>

The fried meat balls, hmm my husband thought they were dog treats. That's what they looked like. They tasted gross. The other snacks were just ok. To much money for what we got. Basically reheated frozen food. Will not be back. The service was good. They even were super polite to a woman who refused to put a mask on.

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>Stopped by the day after their grand opening. Ordered a large brown sugar fresh milk. The drink looked good but they use poor quality boba pearls. Each boba was still hard in the middle. Overall, I was disappointed with the drink and didn’t finish after the first 3 sips. BSB doesn’t stand out compared with other boba places in the area. They fixed the loud music part which I saw in others’ review before I came in. Might give them another try some time later...<//Review><resp>None<//resp>< date>

This was my first time going! So the employees are pretty nice. I ordered a chocolate milk tea. It was basically chocolate milk with extra chocolate. A little sweet but good! Boba was nice, but it was a little hard in the middle. Overall I give it only because the boba thrower both me, and the 2 other people in the car off. Again, good tho. And I plan to go again!<//Text>

<review>Cute new boba shop that opened up.  Their food looks amazing but I didn't get to try any as it was their opening day.  The lines were long and the staff were pretty slow at making items.  The music seemed loud as the cashier had a hard time taking orders and constantly had to ask people to repeat themselves.  I ordered a regular slushy and was disappointed to find out that it was made with milk.</review></record>

<Review>So I’ve been to this place about 4 or 5 times and I have to say that I really enjoy their drinks! The first time I went was about a week after the soft opening, and I waited about 25 minutes. I didn’t mind because they were probably still figuring things out. The next few times I went, the service was much quicker, so I really appreciate that! I have gotten the cookies and cream and mango slush crushed peach. Personally I think their drinks are a little too sweet, but luckily they allow you to adjust the sweetness, which not all boba places do! The employees are super helpful if you have questions. I also really appreciate that the owners listen to customer suggestions! With that being said, please add egg pudding toppings to the menu :) Also, maybe a description after drinks that aren’t super obvious what the flavor is, (like blue kids kreamz). I definitely can’t wait to try more flavors!</Review>< pictures>

Wow just wow. We went as a family and apparently they had some friends of either a worker or owner who were in line in front of us. They got out of line to talk to their friend for about 5 minutes. Then when it would have been our turn they hopped back in line and ordered. Like magic they got the "last 2" bears of the day. It was despicable and we will not go back our weekly trips will be to any other establishment. My autistic son asked for 2 days why the ladies didn't have to wait in line yet got bears.    Wanted to add. Since the owner responded. If an employee has someone get out of line to talk to both them for several minutes and lead them back into line, so your employee felt like someone talking gto them meant they did not need to wait in line. I did mention it to the register employee  who shrugged their shoulders. I was(technically still am) following on social and had stated that. I understood/understand at the time that there was a limit but it seem suspicious that 2 friends of an employee who didn't feel they needed to wait in line were also the last 2 bears of the day. It was a clear example of nepotism. Also the drinks were so sweet my kids were unable to finish them.<//text>

<Resp>{'time': 1619395939530, 'text': 'Hello Amber,\n\nAccording to our policies, we had an limit of 25 Bearbricks a day, and it’s only available for our social media followers who have been waiting for a long time to take a Bearbrick home. After April 1, there are no limit for both Bear bottles and Buddy bottles.\n\nAccording to your statement, we’re assuming the incident may happened before April 1. As for the customer that was in line ahead of you, got out of line then return, their placements was still in line ahead of you. However, if you had felt that the customer that was in line in front of you were cutting for leaving the line then you should have asked them to get behind you directly and personally because we have no authority over sending someone to the back of the line if they were in line in front of you first.\n\nSince the incident wasn’t at our fault, we refuse to apologize for what happened.\n\nGod bless you !\n\nEdit:Hi Amber,\n\nTo refer to your first comment, the customers were already in line ahead of you. In addition, We have discuss the matter with our employees and the reason for the customer getting out of the line was to discuss about their called in regarding orders, menus and the bears. It was not for casual conversation. Thus, after the discussion they were ready to pay and got back in line in their placement where they were in line ahead of you. We do not favor friends or families. All our guests are treated equally. Thus, if they are ahead of you in line then they have the right to order ahead of you. Also, we allow pre order of the bears as well and anyone can put in their orders a day ahead for reservation. That was also part of their discussions as they have place orders as well.\n\nThank you for your understanding.'}</Resp><GmapID>0x809ad9a4a6468c25:0x6552d472c1b3f669< /GmapID></record>

<Review>My first experience at this place when it first opened was amazing, my order was brown sugar with coconut milk, I ask for almond milk they told me they didn't have one so I ask for coconut milk instead and still tasted really good. Until the second time I went and ordered the same drink this lady told me that they were not doing the drink anymore it's because it doesn't taste good she said. My point is that they should provide more milk choices. So then I ordered Taro milkshake with coconut milk and they told me they don't do that as well, so then I ordered mango smoothie with NO MILK and they put milk on it and I can't drink milk that's why BSB
need more milk choices. Would I go to this place again, I don't think I would. Thank you for the experience.<//Review>< Pics>

We went when they first opened and the boba was hard. We decided to wait and let them settle in and then tried again. Glad we gave it a second chance because it was perfect! We will definitely be return customers!</review>

New boba spot in North Highlands. Staff is friendly and professional. And the take one dog bone jar is a nice touch. Unfortunately that ran out of the Thai tea by the time I got here so I’m trying something new, Hokkaido, and it tastes really good.<//Text>

<text>Interesting flavors and the black boba is more chewy, which I prefer. The mocha smoothie with coffee jelly is quite strong and delicious. Slightly sweeter than I usually like but you can have it adjusted, top right corner of menu for levels, but it’s okay for a baseline taste.<//text>< Time>

Got the creme brûlée boba and it was way too sweet. The boba was soft on the outside but hard in the middle. Fries were undercooked and soggy.< /text>

If I could give a negative star I would. I waited for over an hour to get up to the register to order and they had run out of Thai Tea the only thing that I wanted!!!!! I will never spend why time or money at this place again. The music is so loud that the person taking your order cannot hear you.< /Review>

Was excited about finally having a Boba spot in C.H. area but when I visited, I was very disappointed. Ordered the Lychee Tea w/boba, flavor was way too sweet, not much boba, too much ice, and Cups too small for the $5.75 price. I'll just drive out to the Cool Tea Bar in South Sac for my boba next time I'm craving it.< /Text>

Didn’t have a good experience. Music was loud or the cashier was talking too low where I couldn’t understand him. I asked for crystal boba and he said okay. When drinks came and I got regular boba? I told them that I order crystal boba and not boba. The lady say oh we’re out of crystal boba. First of all, the gentleman could of told me that they were sold out, that way I could of chose something else because I don’t like boba ( crystal boba are totally different from regular boba ). Second, the lady could of offer me something else because I did not ask for this but they made it anyways thinking that was okay? Also, we got the brown sugar boba and that taste nothing like the brown sugar boba. Plus, the boba was not formally form or I’m not sure because ours was breaking apart ( which was gross ). We definitely didn’t even finish our drinks. I did order some fried meatballs and took them a long time to fried them and I believe on the broad it said 12 pieces and I got 10 instead. Me waiting for a long time to get our drinks and the food was not worth it at all.</review>

over all it was ok. they had good vibe's. but the prices are to high and when i tryed to call them they didnt answer idk if  they were bissy or if they just didnt here it bc of the music. but i had to pay 17 dollars for my drink that could have been like 6 dollard. but the worker's there were really nice and tryed there best to go fast with the order's. but i think for now ima stike with kp market.<//Text>

I really like this adidas Store Los Angeles/factory outlet on Whittier Blvd in the heart of East LA. The store is bigger than I expected and it was indeed spotless like other google reviews have said. It has to be one of the cleanest, organized Nike outlet stores I have been to.<//review>

Went inside looking for shoes, the one I was looking was sold out, Cory took care of me he was really good. He allowed to me check same model different colors to make sure I would be able to order the shoes online with the right size! Thanks Cory.</text>

This review is for Jeremiah, where should I start...... he is completely unprofessional and really immature. I hope he isn’t the manager at this location. I had asked if they price matched the adidas stores online prices and he said yes although when I went to pay he refused to honor what he had said.
I try to shop in store to keep stores open but I guess Jeremiah is unaware that his job depends on instore sales. I hope he realizes he just cost his store $$$$ loss because I went to Nordstrom where they price matched adidas online price! Good luck Jeremiah with your job.<//text>

awful customer service online and over the phone. Took me a good 5 minutes before I could even get an actual person on the phone. After talking with an associate they were not able to help me and were very rude. I was supposed to pick up two pairs of shoes at the Century City shop the day after I purchased them. At 6 pm I called asking when the order would be ready. The lady working picked up and told me I wouldn't be picking up my order that day, much less at the location I chose online. They said they sent my order to a whole other location (which turned out to be incorrect). The only helpful people turned out to be the representative through the adidas store online, who said I would just have to wait for a future email. Very annoying<//text>

<text>They didn't have the collaboration with Choi Ji Won I was looking for, but the staff was nice enough. It would've been great if they'd offered to call another store to see who did have the collab (turns out: none of them), so I didn't have to spend all that time doing it, but it's not that big of a deal.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Google maps, Yelp, and signs in front of the store reflect that store closes 9pm, Mon-Thurs. We arrived in front of the doors at 7:45pm and the worker inside used a hand gesture, while organizing clothes, instead of having the courtesy to come over to let us know that the store had been closed. First of all, there weren’t any notifications through google maps and yelp indicating any store hour changes affected by holiday so why the sudden store hour change? Second of all, don’t treat your customers with that attitude and take that few extra steps to notify your customers. All the other surrounding Adidas stores honored their store hours, how come you guys can’t? At the end of the day, you weren’t the one driving all the way to the store, all you had to do was walk over to say it was closed, that’s all. Rude workers, don’t shop here. I’d rather go to the store on Melrose.</Text>< userid>

<Review>I wish I can give them no stars but I will never go to this place ever again they had my husband waiting for over an hour!!! The owner greets you as always when he is there......but one thing I noticed is that they take over an hour in just 1 person!!! I mean how long does it take for a man to get a haircut??? I see other people walking in and go straight to the barber plus they charge 5$ to make appointments?? What a way to take your money🤔 my husband will never go back!! You guys just lost a customer!!<//Review>< Pictures>

It can get busy on the weekends so make sure you call to check the wait time. The guys are pretty funny and just spend the whole time talking smack to each other which can get pretty entertaining. Haircuts take a little longer than usual but they ALWAYS leave you fresh. I'm usually a walk in and I've never had a bad haircut from any of the guys. They cut me exactly how I want</review>

Overly priced haircut. $20 for a haircut. But depending who you go to they do a good job. They just charge to much for barbershop.</Text>

First time I took my son, didn't have to wait that much but this second time I waited for 3 hrs and ended up leaving. "Appointments" just kept walking in. When it was my son's turn, three barbers left to lunch. They do great in cutting hair but the wait is too much. They should just make their barbershop an Appointment shop.<//text>

Had an appointment at 5pm with TONY, it's currently 4:57pm and I walked in to find out that tony decided to leave early without any acknowledgement to his current clientele. There was 2 of us just looking at each other like "are you serious, is this really a business or a corner shop with no standards" how can a business try to gain and retain customers if they can't fulfill the needs of paying customers most importantly my VALUABLE TIME!!! I will never return to this piece of turd location that does not value their customers time and stay for their appointments!<//Review>

Waited two hours!!! I got there before other people and they got attended before me just because they knew the barbers, complained to the owner and all he said was to wait for the new guy to come, he was still going to have me wait longer even though everyone there now had arrived after me. Worst service ever, never coming back.< /review>

I normally would expect the face to be included on a line up with a razor. More like around 10-12 with tip included. But no more than 14. I might as well have gotten a full cut.<//text>< UserId.>

I been coming down there for over 3 years too long. They take for ever to even call you up for a cut. Expect to wait atleast 2 hours. Seriously don't even waste your time and money.< /Review>

This is the worst place ever for cutting your hair.
Waiting time it's for ever.
If you can find other place do it.

Barber rank decreases as you move further in to the store. Barbers are extremely cautious with time as they are booked with appointments that allow them gain more revenue per cut. $20 to book an appointment for a standard taper, combover, fade, no shave, no touch on the beard. Decent price but never come here without an appointment because all of Paramount high school will be seated waiting for the next cut. Age demographic here is averaged at 18 years old. Expect a hip look with skeletal beings printed on the walls followed by a big sponsorship aimed at Suavecito. Manny with the tatted face gets down with the fades and he's fast too and he's nice. Danny with the black glove(smaller Danny) is good too. Fresh (bigger Danny, gauges, piercings) does a good job too. Look for the constant glares at the clock or at their watches. Your cut will end exactly at the half hour or on the hour. There's a scripted, "Any plans today?," which makes you feel welcomed rather than just another head on the seat. Owner does a good job at greeting customer's that walks in.<//Text>

Got a hair cut and beard line up but was unsatisfied with the end result for that price. Not only did the guy had no clue how to manage or do beards but the hair cut looked like a beginner cut it< /Review>

Short Review: My go-to pizza, sandwich, salad, etc. spot for the family of four.  5 Stars for years now.
Longer:  Our favorite pizza in the Valley for 10 years. If you haven't tried the Armenian pizza or Khachapuri (like a pizza dough "boat" with cheeses, meat if you like, and sunny side eggs on top), you really should.  The meatballs... I don't think I've placed an order without getting the appetizer meatballs, or the sandwich.  Great service and a local gem.</review>

<gmapID>0x808f7e4881a8f4e3:0x373f8a8597252568</gmapID><Review>When I think of eating authentic Mexican food I think or this Taqueria in the MIssion.  Today I left disappointed.  The tacos barely had any meat.  It was a combination of fat with tiny pieces of meat.  The shrimp plate was tasty but the shrimp had not been cleaned.  You could see the insides were packed with waste.

The prices are still pretty decent at least.  The restaurant itself was not clean.  This place has historically had pigeons inside looking for left overs, but even then it was fairly clean.  I was shocked to see a silver serving dish marinating in the bathroom sink.

Sad to say it's my last time here!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Tacos are really good, but the fact of having the tortillas next to the bathrooms makes me not want to eat them anymore.<//Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Pics>None< /Pics><text>I tried the fried Fish (pescado frito) it has not flavor at all, just oily fish and nothing else. The  rice and beans are not bad but the fish is not good. My daughter ordered “tacos dorados” and are not good either, just one taco in the center had sour cream and some ugly lettuce but the others nothing but fried chicken with not flavor inside and ugly served. My husband ate beef tacos and he liked them. Looks like just meat tacos are fine. I’m Mexican, I grew in Mexico and I know the good Mexican food, this is bad food.< /text></record>

This place is great. Pro tip, go here at dinner time when the Al Pastor is being cooked fresh on the patio. Best street taco I’ve had in 5yrs hands down.<//Text>

<Review>DEFINITELY DISGUSTING!!!!!
VERY PRICEY AND THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE
I ORDERED A BURRITO AND THE AVOCADO WAS BLACK AND NASTY
HOW CAN THEY USE IT AND SERVE SOMETHING SO NASTY
OBVIOUSLY THEY DONT CARE CAUSE THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT CHARGING YOU
THE PEOPLE WERE SO RUDE AND I WOULD NEVER GO BACK THERE NEITHER RECOMMEND IT
WORSE PLACE IN THE MISSION DISTRICT</Review>< Pics>

Tamales and elote sold at night too.

<review>The meat is good and juicy on the tacos but the tortilla gets soggy quickly. They also charge 2-3 more on card and you don’t know there was an extra charge until you leave. I got 4 tacos for what I thought and what the cashier told me was $12 then once I checked my bank, I found that they charged me $2 extra.< /review>< time>

Really nice tacos!  We tried a bunch of them, from the pig neck to the chorizo to the al pastor, all quite lovely.  Self service toppings.  Tacos were like $3 each.  They had a sign for barbacoa tacos (pit cooked lamb) but they didn't have it when we were there.< /text>

It was ok, but the person serving the food was being stingy with the portion of meat. Other people in line said something to the cook too. But the carnitas are really good. But when I went to order more they were out in that few time I was out..  The grilled chicken was ok but it taste more boiled then grilled and its in chunks & not shredded.< /Text>

Very authentic and seem to be very covid safe as the lady taking orders told someone that didnt have a mask on to put one on before taking his order.  There is also outdoor seating.<//review>< Pics>

Legit fantastic tacos at reasonable prices in a no-frills, very colorful spot in the Mission. You know a taqueria is good when your selective Mexican friends have cravings for the food; Taqueria Vallarta has that kind of credibility. Favorites here are the lamb barbacoa, pork carnitas, beef suadero, and lengua tacos, and I am interested in trying the buche (pork neck), which you don't see in many places.</review>

Found the place just walking by it. Gladly surprised to find lots of vegetarian options. Super delicious food. Easily the best Mexican Street food I've eaten. Give toes if salsa, and super cheap chips. Will come again and again.< /Review>

Great local spot for tacos...they had 8 diffedent styles when i came by and of course i had to get one of each...and at only 3.00 each its a grear deal in a city thats hard to find good cheap eats...the tacos are mexican street style so a bit smaller than other places but so flavorful and more filling than they appear. A must stop for anyone!</text>

A stripped down, clean menu of things I didn't recognize. So enticing! And very good value for money. Reasonable prices for flavorful dishes.
I don't mean to imply that the menu is limited, or narrow; there are options  - oh yes, there are options. But the selection has the feel of being pared to the best of the best. I inferred that there had been a dozen other dishes which had simply been left behind, with only the really special things remaining.
Find something familiar or foreign, and enjoy!< /text>

This is the best Mexican place in the Mission. Keep your expectations on the food...this is not a romantic special occasion place...this is just great food for a fair price, it's open late, the portions are big, the staff is cool and you watch the cooks preparing orders while youre in line.l It's a very civilized way to eat...being able to see the food first. It I've Benn back a dozen times since my first.</review>

The taco bar and salsa bar.

The beef tripe or intestine tacos are awesome

The Lengua is awesome as well

I once got a chorizo burrrito and it was too salty for me , I’d stick to the tacos and get a side of rice and beans .

This place is awesome !< /Review>< pictures>

Food was good,  but the dining area was covered in garbage from past eaters.  They are really good at taking your order and your money,  but not so much in keeping their restaurant clean and not run down looking.< /Review>

< Review>
Food is great there. They have a taco stand open till break of dawn, for all people craving tacos at 3 am  or 4am, it will be open at that time to get your tacos craving. Their other dishes are delicious as well. Did notice they hiked up their price, but understand San Francisco/ bay Area isn't cheap at all< /Review>

<Review>They raised their taco prices from $2.50 to $3.
I've never been able to try their tacos because I don't eat meat (vegetarian mostly but pescatarian when I'm being flexible) - but many friends have raved about the tacos here.

From a vegetarian/pescatarian eater point of view, I wouldn't really recommend taqueria vallarta. I've tried the quesadillas, burritos, and plates but I've never been impressed. There are plenty of other vegefriendly taco spots, this just ain't it.</Review></record></dataset><record>

One of the best places to get street tacos in San Francisco. Nothing fancy but they have a huge variety of meats for their tacos, burritos, and other food. This place makes me feel like I'm back in Mexico, but the food quality is even better.< /text>

<Text>Probably the only food place open late on weekdays in the area. Very suitable for those late nights after coming home from a party, concert, etc. and you need a cheap little snack (or 2) to complete the evening.

I've only had the tacos here (not really a burrito person), and the quality of the meat has been consistently amazing. They are only $2.25, too. So many options to choose from - go for more of the fatty meats as they are usually most juicy. We love al pastor.

Environment and ambience is that of a typical Mexican restaurant. If you are looking for a modern, spot clean taco place, this is not going to be it. But if you want a real Mexican environment, check this place out.

There is tons of seating available and it never gets too crowded. That alone makes it better than La Taqueria (the overrated and crowded one!)

Definitely recommended.</Text><resp>None<//resp><Rating>5< /Rating>< UserId.>

Best taco I've ever had. There are a number of places I'd rather go for burritos or other Mexican food, but for tacos it's always Vallarta. My favorites are the pollo and al pastor. Don't forget the grilled onions!< /Text>

<text>They advertise their vegetarian options pretty heavily out front, (see photo) but they are kind of strange flavors like “Italian blend” and “stir fry”. Not stuff I’ve ever wanted in a burrito. Tried the regular veggie burrito made vegan with black beans. Not a lot of flavor and likely lots of cross contamination given the amount of meat/seafood being prepped nearby. At $10, it is pretty steep for a Mission burrito. On the plus side, this place is open late past 10pm.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The rest of the menu is standard fare, and seems to be pretty solid. The agua frescas are good.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Love being able to order the tacos right inside the door.  Check out the murals in the dining area, and then afterwards be sure to check out the Balmy Alley murals.  A new one to be unveiled in October.< /review>

The tacos were extra greasy. Be careful as pricing changes depending if you pay with a credit card vs. Cash. Make sure you have cash on hand so you don't overpay as the food is already expensive for what it is.<//Review>

Why is it that almost no taquerias in the city have a fish burrito option? Except for Taqueria Vallarta that is!

May have come here QUITE a bit in the 2am wkend sitches back in the day. Now I simply enjoy their super fish burritos nice and sober. And for lunch. Or dinner. But frankly it’s good at any time.

Is it just me or has burritos in SF become extraordinary expensive? Well, I suppose that’s a SF everything sort of sitch. But really, $16 for a burrito? It’s a lot. But it’s good. 4 stars.</Text>

I absolutely love this place; this is as legit as it gets.  The tacos are amazing, and cooked to order before your eyes.  There is a great selection of meats, including my favorite, lengua (beef tongue).  I haven't tried the cesos (brain), but it's there for you.  I also haven't tried the vegetarian burritos (including cactus), but they have an impressive selection of those as well.

Every square inch of the walls and ceiling is covered with murals.  They do have bottled beer.  Best of all, they are open until like 4am or something.  I recommend paying with cash ;)< /review>

We miss the Mission and this is by far my favorite taqueria for food, wall art and atmosphere especially when the taco stand is running in full swing. This place hasn’t changed in the 14 years I’ve been tacoing it up.< /text>

<Review>Every time I make a trip to the city, I stop in here for a few tacos. These are the best tacos I've had since I left Arizona. It's fantastic to be able to order right at the door and have it ready on the plancha as soon as you walk in.< /Review>< Pictures>

Authentic Mexican food. Reasonable prices and friendly staff, though it does help to speak a bit of Spanish. Places like this are why the Mission still retains some of its charm and authenticity.</review>

This place is only for when you get out of the club or bar at 2am, drunk and hungry, not really carring about how clean or good the food is, we visited this place around 3pm with kids, and we ordered 2 chorizo tacos, they were squishy, and oily. 2 tripitas tacos, which the tripitas were cut into 2in pieces that looked extremely unappetizing, i mean its intestines at least chop it up into smaller pieces!! We also had 2 suadero tacos, it's supposed to be TENDER beef, the meat was like a chicharron, hard and dry. Never visiting again. On top of that, the lady who was on le register kept yelling to the cook how stupid he was, and how useless, as well as complaining about previous customers, when we approached her she excused herself by saying that she had diabetes and she looses track of what she is doing. Totally inappropriate. NEVER EVER EVER!!!!< /review>

<review>Definitely one of my favorite taquerias in SF. They have a huge vegetarian menu, and their burritos are always great and their salsa bar is super spicy--love it. I've also heard their taco bar is amazing, but it's all meat 😔<//review>< userid>

<review>I LOVE THE TACOS HERE!  The meat is seasoned perfectly, the tortillas are delicious, and all of the fixings including: cilantro, limes, radishs, diced onions, three types of salsa, and grilled onions are absolutely perfect to adorn each taco.  I always bring friends here and tell them they are the best tacos...they never disagree after they sample two or three different types of meat.

They just raised their prices though...tacos are now $2 each.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

MOST AMAZING BURRITO EVER, could have used a little less rice though. I got the pablano stuffed burrito and it was fantastic. My father and I sat at the bar next door and was served food. Great drinks (margaritas).</Text>

Come on, it is not in the best area of the Mish but the tacos are not bad at all. Their chicken fajitas are pretty damn good and their juices (if they are ready). Recommended for something non complicated and cheap.<//Review>

As I'm concern I put them as the number 1 Taqueria in all Northern California, when I have family members visiting from out of state and they are also very picky with their Mexican to Mexican food. They just love it. There is something Magical in the Mission District and I guess this comes from generation to generation of great Mexican people and where there are great people there is great delicious food. And for a fact for you the great founder and chef for Chipotle started there in the Mission District Taquerias in the late 80's early 90's</text>< Pictures>

Probably won't venture back to this place after a rough first time there. It's definitely authentic and the food was pretty good, but if you don't speak Spanish, you'll likely have a hard time ordering.

Also, they were all out of ham for breakfast burritos, so we had to settle for pollo, which wasn't nearly as good as hoped. Seems like they should order more ham so that they don't run out so early on a Sunday...<//Text>

And guacamole is in the form of chunks of avocado rather than the slimy watered down stuff, which is definitely a good thing.  Overall a good solid burrito.

In the shady accounting side of things, I paid with a $20, the cashier hit the 'no sale' button, gave me my change and the rest went in a pile of ones on the register, which she used to make change for the next three customers behind me. Five finger employee discount or giving the finger to uncle sam? The story tonight on 60 Minutes.</review><userid>100884676252145293797</userid><Rating>4<//Rating>< Name>

The food was okay. But the nicest part about this spot was the huge dining room - way bigger than most other taquerias. Plus they had two high chairs in the dining room, a nice surprise when we brought our kids there.</Text>

If you've been looking for good vegetarian burrito options, this is the place!! So many taquerias have a "vegetarian" burrito on the menu that consists of rice & beans and no veggies. Not here. They have SEVEN different options of different veggie combos to choose from! Call ahead for take-out, or stop in. Fast and delicious.<//Text>

The reviews did not match my experience. Detached, unfriendly experience, and the cashier accused me of making a mistake when she rung up the wrong order. The burrito was big, but the taste was nothing special. The only pluses were that they take credit cards and there was no line. That should have been an indication since two other places I passed had lines out the door on a Saturday night.</Text>

Tacos! The tacos are $2.25 each and they serve all kinds of meat. I ordered tender beef and al pastor then I layered it with onions, cilantro, lime juice and salsa. I've had better from a food truck and I'm totally judging by the meat quantity. I also ordered elote in a cup. It was decent and there was nothing to rave about. It's a chill spot and food always comes out fast.</text>

They were OK tacos. They had a large variety of taco meats which had been sitting on their grill by the time I got to it. Kind of pricey at $3/taco and cash only.< /Text>

So I went in here and I ordered a couple of tacos and a quesadilla. The quesadilla was $10.50 but I didn't understand why it didn't even look like a quesadilla and I barely even got my food I waited so long that I didn't want it anymore and when I got it the plate was slid to me disrespectfully and the lady who was serving it was rude. My friend on the other hand got her food way before I did we ordered at the same time. I also order before 12 other people and they all got their food before me. That was the only reason I didn't want my food next to it wasn't worth $10.50 it looks like a burrito half Road without beans rice and lettuce. Like I told the lady who took my order and my friend I would not be coming back there the service sucked. And where the guy was cooking was a mess. And from the looks of it he looks like he makes the orders in the order he wants to not as they come<//review>

They use to be a favorite and now they upped their prices so much it should be a fancier place for a $15 burrito meal. They have veggie options but the hipster prices ruined it. No more.<//text>

You people are some of the most delicious in all of the mission. Especially past 2am when the hunger is strong and the need for tabletop fried intestines with radish and hotsauce is greatest! The tripas had been of varied texture, consistency, flavour, as has everything really, depending on person working the tabletop fry contraption.  This is not a bad thing. It's like being able to go to 4 different taco places all in one spot. Seating is ample, drunk super hotties stumbling around  (ok ok swaggering is better. Nay! Sauntering!!! Yes that much much better!) , whilst their dudes sit and stare at anyone who dares gaze overly intently on the skin tight white jeans or 3 size to small see through tops.... mmm mm did I say they have a really friendly and super nice staff as well as tacos? Oh. Good. It's true. Go here you plebs! Now! (Or wait till night and for tequila first)</review>

Pretty good street style tacos at the taco bar. Open late nights. The asada, carnitas and barbacoa are good. There may be small bones in the meat beware.<//Text>

The taco bar is fast and delicious and easy and open late. If there's a long line, you can have someone save your spot and prepay for your tacos at the register so you can get to eating right away!!</Text>

A great local institution on 24th. I've depended on it a bit too much for spontaneous quick eats (either the taco bar, or the super burritos al pastor). They also have more significant meals, of which I particularly enjoy the Siete Mares - a soup with about as much different seafood as you would expect in the same bowl together. Great value either way you go. Don't forget to grab the orange sauce!<//text>

<review>First time here in a few years, the quality was on point - the prices have gone up to an upper mid-tier taqueria but there was a lot going on here.  A woman was on one side making and selling elote (mexican style corn), also a taco cart on the another side.  A lot of space to sit down inside too and kept decently clean.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f7e4881a8f4e3:0x373f8a8597252568< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Al Vapor Tacos till late...TILL 3AM!!! Fresh meat cooked streetside, and not just your normal steak and pork. They have the whole head-to-tail mexican cuisine.
Forget your 'california' food that is head to tail, get back to the Alta California cuisine. of great meat tacos!</review>< date>

The most dirtiest taco place in Frisco I promise I will never eat food here because my experience was awful as I walked into the place the first thing I see is an old wet mop at the entrance of the door the place was extremely loud and ness the trash was all over the place and after I made my order I stood against the wall for twenty five minutes waiting for my food. They gave ne the wrkng order and the food smelled disgusting I hated it.</text>

This used to be my favorite place to get tacos until last night I got food poisoning from their prawn burrito, and my husband got sick from their tacos. Either the ingredients are bad or unsanitized food handing. Very disappointed!</text>

Yuck!!!!! VOMIT!!!!! Disgusting, do not go!!! They tried to sell us spoiled food, and would not refund us. I bought a taco from the taco bar, and you could smell the spoiled meat, that nasty sour smell. We also ordered Menudo, and first of all there wasn't any Homny, second the meat smelled bad, sour and gross. We didn't even touch our food and I asked for a refund. The store manager said "no" and I wasn't going to put up a fight, so we left. Never go here!!!
San Fran you need some real Mexican food restaurants!! Take SAN diego Mexican restaurants for example.<//Text>

Kind of overpriced. There are probably about seven Mexican restaurants in the mission that are better than this one but if you’re in a pinch it’s OK.</review>

I was highly recommended here, very dissapointed.

First the cashier kept talking to me in english when i crearly was talking spanish this was very sad
Second she didnt want to bring my food to the table she haf me get up no napkins she also kept eating and chewing like a cow while i was ordering
I also ordered 2 tripe tacos meat tasted and felt like it was recooked like 5 times
Overall flavor was meehh for the burrito

Surely never going back to this place

Not sure if they are owners or just employees but they need to learn to be more humble</Review>

Solid food with big portions. Tacos are the line in the front and made to order. Salsas are quite spicy even pico de gallo. Habanero really gets to you after alittle time. A bit down and dirty but nicer than faralito and cancun.<//Review>

<Text>I've stopped by several time for tacos at night when everything else is closed. Tacos are cheap and served late into the night. Authentic, traditional tacos with a variety of meats such as chorizo, al pastor, carne asada, etc, topped with cilantro, onion, and salsa.

The place is covered in murals and has as lively atmosphere.< /Text>< resp>

I went here with a group of friends. Most of them had tacos. Two of us had shrimp quesadillas. This place has the typical taco stand within the restaurant. You just go there and choose out your ingredients and watch your taco being made.

The quesadillas were great. They are the common quesadilla that you find here in the bay, folded almost like a buritto with no top and bottom. The ingredients were all fresh and well prepared.

This place is just a solid taqueria. You can't do wrong by going here.</text>

Taqueria Vallarta is my favorite place to go for tacos in SF. They have about 10 different types of meats so you can try all the weird ones. Hands down my favorite is al pastor. I can eat about 4 and they usually put a lot of meat on top with 2 tortillas per taco, so what I like to do is separate the tortillas and meat so that they are equally distributed. This gives me more room for salsa, fresh cilantro and onions. Really can't beat the price and convenience.

Last year I think the 24th street location was closed for a few months because they found out widgeons were living in the ceiling. I was severely disappointed, since 24th street is closer to me than the 16th/mission location.  One does not go to Taqueria Vallarta for cleanliness or ambience, you go there for great tacos!

I love al pastor.<//Text>

<Time>1394669169912</Time><rate>4< /rate><review>Hubs and I were on our weekly mission to dine out in SF. We wanted something quick and 'affordable'.  We both had tacos. Based on reviews I had read I was gunning for 5 tacos. Thank goodness the fella setting up the tacos misheard me and gave me 4 tacos... or maybe he did hear me and thought I was over-ordering... at any rate 4 was more than enough for me and I am a good eater.

I had:
Pollo Asado
Carne Asada
(2) Al Pastor

Hubs had:
Pollo Asado
Carne Asada
Chorizo

We both agreed hands down Pollo Asado was the best. I found this shocking, I don't usually order chicken at taquerias because I try to choose something I wouldn't make at home (we make a lot of chicken at home). Normally, Al Pastor or Carnitas are my go to. I wouldn't order the Carne Asada, Chorizo or the Al Pastor again. But I would definitely get Pollo Asado and try some other choices.

Cantaloupe Aqua Fresca was amazing (we took 3 to go), Hibiscus Aqua Fresca was good but too sweet for me to order again.

It's a cute (not cozy) interior with lots of murals to look at. Lots of tiled tables with benches.

Next time, I'm getting corn with mayo and queso and a bunch of tacos. We'll be back.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808f7e4881a8f4e3:0x373f8a8597252568< /gmap_id></record>

I bought a couple of coupons from groupon and went straight to work. I bought the tacos and burritos so thats what I'm gonna base my reviews on. Depending on certain days, the meat are really good and sometimes they can be really dry. I got a chicken burrito which was fairly good for its price which was $5.25 I think... The chicken and rice was moist and nothing taste out of the ordinary. The tacos were nice but I think they're overrated compared to the other reviews. Its just your typical taco but they have a salsa bar with a lot of different stuff such as cilantro, different salsas, toppings and etc. What I recommend is the Lengua and Cabeza because they're underrated meat. A lot of Americans never heard of these meat selections and will probably never try it because they don't want to leave their comfort zone but I love it. The meat texture is new and unique and that brings something different to the table besides the typical carne asada and pollo. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a quick cheap bite.<//Text>

<Response>None</Response><Text>First meal in SF and some of the best tacos I've ever had. I ordered one lengua (tounge), one cabeza (head) and one pollo (chicken). The chicken was a great and one of the beef was superior to the other, but I don't know which was which. Awesome toppings bar and make sure to ask for caramelized onions on top. Each taco is just $1.75. Washed it down with horchatta which was sweet (and more expensive than the taco's at $2.00!).< /Text></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The tacos are fine. But the service is a disaster. The cashier, who attended to me according to what I was told is a close relative of the owner, is always in a bad mood. She's a poor employee in the wrong place.

An incessant back and forth of locals, who come to taste, among other things, tacos at $ 3 per unit made up as you wish at the dedicated stand !! Beware of the spicy sauces that you will add to your tacos !!! It "moves" !!! it will take more than one "cerveza" to put out the fire, if your hand is too heavy !!
