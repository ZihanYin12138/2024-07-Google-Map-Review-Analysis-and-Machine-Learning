I had no problems with this place until the night of May 31-June 1. They were broken into by multiple looters. Many units were ransacked and items were taken. Walls were broken connecting to others and it looked like it was easy for the thieves to get where they wanted to. My beer is I wasn't notified until mid morning of June 2nd. I don't understand why it took so long. After questions to management I found out their security system and oversight by employees needs a lot of improvement.<//review>

Sham is the best! He is very professional, courteous and efficient. I was downsizing to another unit and he made the transaction seamless. It's a pleasure to do business with him. The facility is well kept. Always clean and comfortable.
I would highly recommend this Storage location.</Review>

<text>My experience with Ehtisham and ExtraSpace have been nothing but a safe, friendly, and reliable service! In times of need he was always there to be a kind extension of the business, and go above and beyond the duty of his job!  The friendly staff, safe environment, and affordable units are all the more reason to choose this specific location!<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>It was a clean and safe unit. However, they do not warn you when they raise your monthly rental costs. We only recently found out when we checked our bank accounts. We went from paying $73 a month to $120 these past few months. It would be helpful if they notified you 6 months ahead like the original manager stated when we got our unit. Never happened. Be prepared for the same when you rent out a unit here.< /Text>< pictures>

Jerry gave the best customer service I have had in a long time. When there is so much of the lack of customer service in the traveling I do, it’s refreshing to have a great customer service experience. Thanks Jerry for making my day, even though now I have to move all that stuff I have in the space you provided me today. Thanks for making it a little more enjoyable!!</review>

I called to check for availability the morning of my move. This was a move that was unexpected and I needed something easy in my life at the moment. From calling to check for availability, meeting Sham, seeing the unit, signing the contract, and moving my things in, it was quick and easy. Let’s see how the rest of my stay goes though.< /Text>

Great property I've had storages at 2 different extra space storage locations and this by far is the best one the manager is very professional and friendly only negative thing is the prices are higher than most other storage companies but that's a corporate thing but worth the money.< /text>

I had a wonderful experience at the Extra Storage Space in Cypress. The Store Mgr Glodean was very helpful and knowledgeable. The access to my storage was fairly easy. Plus, the facility was nice looking and clean. It looked so much better then the other facilities I visited in the area that same day. Very happy! : )<//review>

After reserving a unit online I received a call from the Manager who invited me to visit that afternoon to ensure the site and the size of the unit would be suitable. I was shown my unit and we went over the details of the terms and conditions. As it was the last unit of this size I went ahead with the unit rental there and then. Everything was dealt with in a quick and professional manner and the staff could not have been more helpful.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Checked on line got an excellent deal, made reservations to look before renting,  got there, very friendly service, got ready to look at space and was informed the lift was not working only accessible by stairs,  not good when your storing large appliances,  was not offered a ground level one at the advertised special rate to compensate, could not take this unit. Went on line and read reviews, one person left a review in October  ( this was now Nov) saying it had been broken for months and was unable to remove his things.

<text>This is my first time needing storage space and wasn't sure what to expect. I just know I wanted it to be clean and safe. This place is both. I initially reserved a basic unit and was sold on the climate controlled unit. The building is new and amazing. So cool and clean. Glodean gets 10 stars. She showed me exactly what I asked for and made recommendations based on my needs. The paperwork was simple and she exains EVERYTHING...Talk about patience and being professional.   Next day I made a change  and rented another unit and she didn't flinch. She got right on it and 20 minutes later I was done...
I feel completely confident with this facility.<//text></record>

I would sincerely appreciate it if Extra Space Storage upper management will acknowledge Ehtishan Raja’s effort in making sure that customers are being appreciated when they choose Extra Space Storage vs the other storage companies.

Shan has a positive attitude and has the ability to make things possible (that is a first for a GM of Extra Space Storage basing from my personal experience and I had been a client for more than a decade.)

The competition in the storage industry is stiff but I truly believe that having a General Manager like Shan  in your team will be a big help in retaining clients and gaining new customers.< /review>

I needed a storage space last minute and Steve was able to help us out right away.  The customer service was great; both Glodean and Steve were very friendly.  Steve showed us several options and helped us pick a space that was right for us.   The facilities were very clean and looked secure.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for a space.</Review>

<text>The manager is awesome!  Although I showed up late, she had a great sense of humor and was very knowledgable of everything that needed to be told. The electronic system is great as well.  Facility is clean and monitored to expectations. I will definitely recommend to anyone needing storage.</text>< Pictures>

I was previously a customer at this location and very pleased with the facility and on-site manager.  When I needed storage again I didn't hesitate to return to Extra Space in Cypress.  And once again I was very pleased with the facility, the monthly rate and the on-site manager, who always does a great job.  Thanks!</text>

I needed a storage space last minute and Steve was able to help us out right away.  The customer service was great; both Glodean and Steve were very friendly.  Steve showed us several options and helped us pick a space that was right for us.   The facilities were very clean and looked secure.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for a space.<//Text>

This storage is managed by the most efficient, personable, and considerate manager Glodean. Since I came in here 2010, she has been welcoming, courteous, and friendly. She is the reason I remained here even though I had reasons to move elsewhere in Corona. In case of need, I would move right back here.

Very good customer service. The lady in the front desk, Glo, was nice enough to open the back gate for me and let me take my time to decide which storage is the right size for my stuff while the movers were there.</text>

<text>08/27/16 called from the hg facility to make sure they were going to be open, as soon as I walked in shawn & the black lady that worked there gave each other this weird look, l asked about the pricing & they quoted a rate higher than what I was told on the phone & when I asked to see the unit inside they didnt want to show it to me, ive also been told by other facilities that if im storing my insured vehichle i dont need to carty insurance they said that wasnt the case that i had to buy their insurance & that i needed the vehichle registration present as well, it was about 5:15 & the facility closes at 5:30 I can tell by their demeanor & short answers that they were in a rush to close & made me feel unwelcome their, so Im sitting outside of their office writing this review to let u both know your service sucked & you both can eat a fat one, I hope corporate notes that I was quaoted differe t rates in person than what I was told over the phone.<//text>< resp>

<Text>Came back here from out of state to find that their doors are closed to the public. Was told they only offer pre-orders online & curbside pickup. I personally like to hand pick my items myself. Not a fan of curbside ordering. Bummer... the only reason I squeezed in Ocean Beach on my trip! 😞👎</Text>< time>

Has a great vibe! They have all kinds of classes. Went to a yoga class here. LOVED IT! Stayed after to talk to instructor and owner.  They patiently listened and took the time to give me so great insight! The owner listens to whatever your needs are.  She is very friendly, attentive, insightful, and knowledgeable in all the plants, crystals, herbs, and spiritual practices.<//Text>

Gain insight with helpful recommendations, readings, books and resources, cleanse & align chakras here. Parking can be a little tricky at times so plan accordingly.

<Text>I love the energy of this place! The owner, Diana, is friendly and helpful and intuitive.  Cute little store with not only lots of crystals, pendulums, herbs, books, some handmade candles and more but they also do readings, classes and  monthly circles.
I get most of my metaphysical supplies here and I just love them. I am a body worker, energy healer, tree hugging, earth loving enthusiast and love going to this place to buy what I need to keep me in my zen.<//Text>< username>

I  ordered online. Although I've never met in person, there are clearly some great people on the other end of this internet connection...

Do yourself a favor, save your soul, don't buy incense from Amazon, give these kind people your business.</review>

<Review>I visited the store for the first time today (June 7), I found the owner to be very knowledgeable and helpful. My shamanic healing with Jessica was AMAZING!  I will definitely be returning for more healing and goodies. I truly recommend this store as the people who work there strive to make your experience the best.</Review>< rating>

I love this store and their many offerings.

I have attended some lectures and events here.  They are great about accommodating attendees; however, I highly recommend getting their a bit early to get reasonable seating.<//review>

Always kind and magickal, you can find the best of tarot as well as all your scents, gems and beautiful cards. If you're lucky, the local black cat of OB may stop in for a spell. Look up their daily calendar which will tell you if psychics are available or if there are events on the day you come in. I have been going here for years. If you are wiccan, there are many herbs and elixirs to enjoy. It is a welcoming atmosphere and a groovy place to see within footsteps from the beach. 🌴 🏄< /text>

The food was very good and more than reasonably priced. Strange part is that I don’t remember anyone asking us what we wanted to drink. We were given water and the glasses were kept full. The pineapple shrimp rice was delicious. Went there for dinner and it was my first time. Recommended by a friend and it didn't disappoint. Prawn Egg rolls were good as was the Thai Basil Beef. Got it medium + spicy and it was good. Service is not rushed which makes for a slow enjoyable eating experience.<//text>

<review>I went to taste the food for a decision about catering my father's funeral. The food was delicious. Unfortunately, they brought the food late--during the funeral and the pad Thai was made spaghetti noodles instead of the nice pad Thai noodles I had at the restaurant. It was disappointing and nobody ate it. There were pans and pans leftover. Bait and switch. The egg rolls were nice.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
We were super hungry after my daughter's graduation. We decided on Thai food, and my daughter had initially suggested another restaurant near Golden 1, but saw Lotus Thai, which is literally across the venue. We ordered a few appetizers, fresh and fried spring rolls, calamari, papaya salad, wonton soup, and I know, looking at the attached pics, we kind of ordered a lot of fried rice dishes, but some of us have allergies or preferences. Everything that we ordered came out fast, fresh, and delicious. Our server was very patient and did a fantastic job. We will definitely come back and will try the other dishes. We found a gem! Overall experience is: ☆☆☆☆☆ 5 stars!!!</Review>

I did a review for this place yesterday and I had.. Food was great while I dined in and did get a take out order of Laab (larb gai) and I have to say as a former Thai cook I truly enjoy yours! I would go back just for that!!! Great job!</text>

While wandering downtown, we happened upon Thai Lotus. Nestled in a beautiful courtyard, the charm of this little restaurant has earned our respect. The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. We will certainly put this place on our rotation. While there are many Thai restaurants in Sac, few have the charm and setting this one has.<//Review>

Thai is my absolute favorite food and I have had it all over the world. This place was at best mediocre for what I had. Chicken satay was extremely dry and cut super thin so there was a very small amount of chicken. Panag curry was very watered down. This is a cardinal sin of how to serve a curry. Just way too watery. Maybe 3 ounces of beef in the dish. Small portions over all. Coconut rice was by far the best thing I had and was actually pretty good. Mango wasnt ripe though. Place was not busy at all. Now I know why.<//Review>

I stopped in while waiting for Amtrak departure.
The wait staff/server was pleasant. I had to request a straw twice. Food was mediocre. My impression of the place was quaint. But as o departed, I discovered this little underground establishment has some substantial size. Wait person could be more engaging. He gave me water dropped off menu, no recommendations of specials & i had to flag to place order.  All in all. I wasn't sitting in the cold waiting for my train</text>

<text>Hidden Gem in the Center of Chinatown.

Very delicious, fresh and authentic food.
I had a rich and hearty chicken soup. My husband praised the Chow Mein as the best he ever had.

The owners are very nice and welcoming.

Definitely on our list for regular visits.</text>< pictures>

Excited to have found some other food than sandwiches and burgers. Came here for a business lunch. Service is slow. They only have two wait staff with multiple functions from taking orders, cashier, serving food and cleaning tables. Not too sanitary. The wait staff did not wash their hands or hand sanitize between each function. Didn't have the option to order from their regular menu. The waiter insisted that the  meals available are the only ones on the lunch menu. Salad is in minimal portion. Food was decent tasting. Not really Thai Food. Maybe this is the only Thai restaurant in downtown Sacramento. It's only busy because it's the only restaurant in a rundown Chinatown area.  This business would have not survived in any other city.< /text>

Third time is the charm. We had to go back three times as this place is always full. Be prepared to wait from 20 to 30 minutes. The pho is delicious and servings are big. Service is fast. I guess finally getting to eat here was a bit anticlimactic. We were expecting too much from the pho.< /Review>

Me and my friend went there this past Saturday.  I was a bit hungry, and thought it was good I could save some for the next day.  The food was so good that I could not stop eating and finished the entire dish!   It was one of the best Thai dinners I have had, if not the best.   I highly recommend this place, friendly staff as well.  Thank you!<//Text>

In town for a work function and just chose this place because it was close to our hotel. Didn't have high expectations but was totally wrong. The service was amazing, food even better, and atmosphere totally pleasant. Great prices too! 10 out of 10 would go again.<//text>

Great place for Thai food!  Even the salad they serve is great, they use a peanut dressing which is absolutely amazing and goes well with the greens! Recommend the pad thai, always a good choice. The service is great and friendly!<//text>

Lotus is casual and friendly with the feel of being served out of the family kitchen. Dishes are authentic but can be customized. If you haven't been there before, be aware that the restaurant is below street level and not visible from the road but venture into the sunken square and you'll find it.<//Review>

Got busy at lunch time, food was nothing spectacular.  Ordered a curry with chicken and chicken was so bland like it was cooked with no flavor and tossed into the curry. Owner did not offer and serve every table the same.  I was not asked if I wanted hot tea... also... owner seemed interested in serving a specific race vs treating all the same.<//Review>

I think of myself as a Drunken Noodle junkie and this place always satisfies my cravings. I have tried all of the thai restaurants in downtown and this place serves me the best drunken noodles with chicken thai hot hands down!

I feel a cravings coming on now... time to order!< /Review>

This is a great lunch spot: reasonably priced, good food, and vegetarian options. It's also fairly quick if you're on a lunch break.< /review>

I ordered Curry Dinner. It didn't come with rice. I looked in Door Dash menu for extra rice and there wasn't any. I have ordered at 3pm and the lunch comes with rice and is less money. I have never in my life ordered Thai Curry that didn't come with rice.< /review>

< Review>
The food was really bland and did not satisfy my craving for curry. When you order the curry you don't get rice with the curry. I've never had to order rice to go with my curry. I was really disappointed in this place.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Food is okay. There is no place to park nearby, so you need to park your street coin or garage.

(Original)
음식은 무난한 편입니다. 근처 주차할 곳이 없어서 스트리트 코인 파킹이나 garage파킹해야합니다<//Review>

Great food, affordable price, minimal wait time for food to be made. It's a nice restaurant where you can have dinner with friends and family. Parking is a bit of a hassle but you can find a parking space in the surrounding streets.< /Text>

Thought this was going to be a larger space, thought it would have carpet and a five star chef, thought it would have black clad servers bending on my every word. Instead I found a beautiful Asian woman hosting a modest tile floor dining room, and an attitude of jovial and gregarious customer service. It's a family establishment she said, and the food, which I took back to my hotel was mouth wateringly memorable... Prolly be back tomorrow.< /text>

Pretty good Thai food. Fairly large portion for the price. They have a good lunch special too. Soft drinks are from a can, so no refills.<//review>

Clean restaurant with decent prices, tasty food and nice quiet service. They have a Seafood Special for $15 that is very spicy and I'm addicted to it. It's a full plate of clams, crab, shrimp, scallops, calamari, and it's just wonderful.

The shared parking lot is small and always full during the busy hours, sometimes you have to park somewhere nearby.<//Review>

As always the food was very good we had the Tadpi Noodles with shrimp, Beef chop suey, Beef with chili onions and peppers, Extra spicy Deep Fried Cat Fish and Steamed Rice. Meal was very good and as always their were plenty leftovers for another meal for two. We hve been dining at VIM's  since they were on Vermont  and 4th. St. over 35 years and was happy when they opened on Rossmor even thoough we still go to the  VIM's in Hollywood when we take out guests and want an Ice cold Tai Beer.< /Review>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2b8cbd7ce0bd5:0x636563420e48757a<//Gmap_id><text>It was a small and clean place for Thai food. The service was very good (for 5 star). Both waiters greeted me promptly and gave the attention when I needed. I ordered a stir fried dish (beef and green bean in Thai curry sauce). The beef tasted a little bit dry, but overall, the dish taste good (3 star). The steam rice does not taste like Thai rice, but it is not a big deal. The wonton in the wonton soup was better than I expected from a typical Asian restaurant in the U.S. (but of course, not as good as the ones in China). Overall, I had good experience eating in this restaurant.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>111770081476502336367</userid><user_name>Linchi Kwok< /user_name>< date>

The main guy Joe helped me with an engine for a 08 honda odyssey, I mistakenly got an i-vtec and needed a regular Vtec engine. He helped me exchange it for the right one. Helped me out a lot, engine runs great no problems.</Review>

My friend recommended this place because he bought his 6 speed sti swap from here few months ago. I haven't bought anything from this shop but stopped by recently to check out what they had. Nick were incredibly friendly and super knowledgeable. The prices seemed more than fair and they had an incredible amount of motors and parts. HUGE INVENTORY at least 500 motors in stock ! I will for sure buy my STi swap from this swap.<//Text>

Nick have been very helpful, communication is superb and our motor run like new. My dad and I drove from Sacramento to pick up a motor for our Toyota Tundra 2002. The drive was worth it. Super clean motor inside and outside. My dad doesn't speak English but thanks to Nick, he explained everything in Spanish. Good customer service. He showed us all his inventory and my DAD pick up the one he liked. Clean shop ! I will recommend to anyone. Thanks man!<//review>

<Review>I called and spoke to Nick about a 13B twin turbo swap. I asked for additional pictures of the actual motor and received by email. Quick response and good communication. I drove from San Diego to LA and finally saw the item in person. I was amazed. Quick tour of the shop. This place was packed all the way to the roof. Motors and motors. I Never saw a big place like that. Nick was very honest and explained that the motor has low compression. He work out on the price and I was more then happy. Appreciate the honesty ! Anyways I was rebuilding that motor. They helped me to loaded the motor in my truck. Thank you !</Review><username>Ruben Lolis</username></record>

I called and spoked to Nick regarding a 2010 Subaru Outback motor. I was told by another shop the early version of EJ25 will work into my car but wasn’t true. Nick took the time to explain everything before I bought. He also recommended a local mechanic shop and the engine was swap in 2 days. Knowledgeable staff and good quality engine at fair price.< /Review>

{'time': 1612306467052, 'text': 'On 01/02/2021 This kid came and bought a motor with his dad. Before purchasing the motor, it seems he had knowledge and as per him hes a CERTIFIED MECHANIC. Everything went smooth and he even pick up the motor. He shows up the next day 02-02-2021 claiming he gave him the wrong motor and hes not going to work for him as per the forums that he read a lot and made a lot of research. He asked for another motor and we gave him. Suddenly, he called his buddy over the phone and then he starts teaching him where to see on the block if that the right one. I have showed him on the cylinder head that’s the number you are looking for? he starts arguing and saying you dont know about motors. We didn’t want to argue with him, so I asked his dad to tell him to sit in the car we want to talk to a mature and comprehensive person. Hes dad tell me what if we install and the engine don’t start. I propose hes dad we have a local mechanic shop that install motors and they will take care. They refused. At this point there’s nothing we can do.'}< /Response>

<text>I purchased a CA18det engine on September 1st from Nick Rehm smooth transaction until I paid for the motor then he said that they’re no warranty on nothing else but the motor and transmission and if I didn’t agree he wouldn’t send the motor.the motor came in incomplete missing the MAF sensor, cut engine harness bad coil, bad ignitor I had to source parts internationally. He didn’t want to extend my warranty. The motor finally starts, but it smokes a lot. Has a bad turbo too. Wouldn’t recommend buying any turbo engines from them.</text>< pictures>

Great Importer ! These guys are top notch in the industry. I bought my V7 STi front clip and couldn’t be more happy. The clip came with everything. My motor and drive train run like a new car. Body panels are in excellent condition for a 18 years old car. Highly recommend this place over a lot of other JDM place in California. These guys have the quality and quantity. Big warehouse full of parts. Great selection of wheels.This spot is Legit! Keep the great work guys I will for sure be a return client for my next project. Thanks !< /review>

I was in search of a front and rear subframe for my R32 GTR. I saw a listing that they had and called to confirm it's availability. I spoke with Nick, who was able to confirm that the item was in-stock and advised me to come and take a look at it. Once I was there, Nick showed me everything (and even gave me a tour of the shop, very cool). He allowed me to take as much time as I needed to make sure it was what I needed. We even talked about cars in general, which was pretty cool. I'll definitely be back in the future when I need things for my GTR. Thanks again Nick.</review>

I dealt with Nick for a set of volk racing wheels and he’s very easy to work out for pricing. The same day my friend bought the 2000 spec  B18c TYPER swap. I am glad he choose JDM California motors because the motor was super clean inside. Great compression. I will for sure be a return client. Thanks<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Really bad services. I asked them to do a compression test and they didn't want too. The guy seemed a bit sketch and was trying to rush the process of the buy. He said he didnt accept card only cash. So that made it even more sketch. So I told him never mind I don't want to buy it since you don’t want to the test infront of me. He got mad and gave me this rude attitude. BAD SERVICES!!!!!!! DONT COME HERE</text>

I bought a 5VZ engine from Nick at JDM California motors and couldn’t be more happy. Clean motor and definitely low mileage. No core charge and you can see the motor in person before purschase. Best price in Los Angeles area.< /Text>

I bought my Rb26 from Nick at JDM California motors in Los Angeles. Great experience. I went 2 times before purchasing the motors and he was always very friendly and let me walk inside the shop. Legit jdm store. Everyone make sure to hit these guys up for your RBs swap. They have a huge selection and good price.</Text>

JDM California motors is the perfect place to get your used motor! The entire procedure was stress free and the service is impeccable.  The owner is straightforward. They answered all my questions before i bought my 2jz swap. Pics and videos of the actual swap was sent quickly thru email and it was an easy transaction.  Very friendly customer service. Make sure to hit these guys up for your project , they are the real deal !< /text>

I bought a SR20 S15 swap from Nick and recently bought a RB26 motor. Both swap work great ! I don’t mind driving from the Bay Area to LA to come see the inventory in person. Good customer service and good motors. I have dealt with some Jdm shop in the Northern California and became a nightmare when you asked them for Infos. Buyers buy with confidence. This is a legit JDM shop.<//review>

5 stars to this business. They value their customer. A few weeks ago I bought a 1JZ swap and they shipped to my house after few days. Motor was perfectly tight on the palette but my motor came with a broken VVTi selenoid. I called and spoke to Nick and he work out something right away. Item was perfectly described before the transaction. Additional pics and videos before I purchased. My motor started with No issue. Clean and complete swap. I will for sure be a return client and give them more business to this company. Thank you for the smooth transaction and customer service.<//Text>

I called and spoke to Nick for a V6 STI Ra limited front clip and he ask me to come in person to see the clip. I asked for some additional pics  before I make the drive from San Diego to LA and he quickly sent to my email. When I show to JDM California motors to see the front clip I was surprised how clean it was for a 20 years old car. Nick hook me up for all the parts. I spend almost 10k  and I didn’t had enough money to buy the set of prodrive wheels that I wanted for long time at this time. He told me he will keep it for me until I have the money without any deposit. Overall I am happy with my clip. None of the Jdm shop has this kinda front clip. Ask for Nick at jdm California motors.<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>I dealt with Nick for few v7 STI 6 speed gear box and never had a single problem. This is the only spot in SoCal to get your Subaru motor and drivetrain. They are very knowledgeable in the auto industry. They can source almost any STI V7 parts. Beautiful selection and great customer service!< /review>< pics>

<name>Daniel Ortega< /name><text>My experience with these guys was absolutely outstanding!  Purchased a clean B18C typer swap with some Recaro seats.  They offered great price. Theres a lot of jdm shop in the area but none of them has the quality and good service. Compression tested in person. Quick tour of the shop and they have a lot of motors and parts. YOU CAN TELL THESE GUYS ARE DOING GREAT WITH ALL THE INVENTORY. They responded to all my questions.  Great business to deal with and I wouldn't hesitate purchasing from them again in the future. I will for sure coming back for the front end. A big THANKS</text></record>

Nick helped me so much with all the questions I had. New Engine swap is running great. I also used his mechanic services and they are fast! Car was ready in 2 days! Very honest and I highly recommend. Great price too. Nick also helped me with other questions I had not related to engine but other car info. I appreciate that! Thanks JDM California Motors! Thanks Nick!</Review>

He referred me to Luis or Enrique at Oscars Motor 5954 Maywood Ave. Just a few blocks away from where his location was. The people at Oscars Motor are shady, unlicensed not to mention nobody there speaks English. They installed my motor but in the process they either damaged my exhaust manifold or replaced it with a damaged one in hopes to get more money. I called nick to see if he could help with this situation since it was his referral and the mechanics at Oscars Motor don't speak English and there was a language barrier. Nick ended up hanging up on me. Beware when dealing with both of these companies they are both shady and only care about making a quick buck.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Spokr on phone with owner prior to flying out to la he assured me it was a good working engine and once i hooked it up low compression and wont even start.

After searching around at countless importers I decided to go with nick at Jdm California motors which ended up being the best descion I've made , motor had great compression and everything was included for swap. He's very nice and knowledgeable. He doesn't pressure wash the engines down also before you purchase it which helps a lot . Shinny motors are cool but it's on the inside that counts . He also did a compression text Right there on the spot and let me inspect the spark plugs . It was a positive experience. I will do slot more business with California Jdm motors in the future . I highly recommend them '!< /text>

Thanks Nick for the great product, I'll come back for sure and recommend to others.<//review>< pictures>

Warning , this place is Garbage. Wasted my time and money . I was sold a used transmmision from junk yard. The Guy that sold it to me , said its from "JAPAN" ! But the transmission had greese and oil all over the place. When motors and transmissions come from "JAPAN" they are cleaned and tested , then rapped in plastic, shipped to US. I payed $350 for this garbage. I tryied returning this transmission the next day, the guy that works there did not want to refund my money. I told him I will call the police iff he did not pay me my cash . He said " Ill give u $250 back and charge u a $100 dollar stock fee !!!! I told him to give me $300 and keep $50 . Moral of story is , take a mexanix with you when you buy used parts. because theres alot of "Ratz" out there. Just like that Piece of  S_ _ T that sold me that Junk.<//Review>

100% customer satisfaction!!! I will definitely be referring anyone and everyone to this company. From the moment we walked in the door Jhann was kind, understanding and upfront with us!

polite. Top notch. Ryan took excellent care of my
car and insured that all replacement parts were
factory parts. After the work was completed I
noticed other damage that wasn’t noticed before,
I called Ryan and he instructed me to bring the car
in right away. They fixed it while I waited!  Very good service. I appreciated it!</text>< gmapID>

My Tesla unfortunately got hit by flying debris on the freeway.  Messed up my bumper, hood and cracked my windshield.  Platinum Collision was great.  All the people I dealt with were very friendly and professional.   I got updates on my car pretty much every day, even if there wasn't an update they would still send an email letting me know my car was on track for the scheduled delivery date!  My car was completed a week early so thats even better!   Hopefully I dont have to come back again but if something happens I would definitely take my car to Platinum Collision again.< /review>

Day one receptionist was amazing helped answer any questions I had. Kyle was in charge of my car and I could not be happier. Grateful for his tentative attention to my car always giving me updates. Received my car 4 days sooner than expected and an amazing job done!! Don’t go anywhere else except here!! Thank you everyone at Platinum ❤️<//review>

<user_id>116732016728899223108< /user_id><text>It all started with Kay, the Receptionist, helping me with the process. She was professional, courteous and answered all my billing questions. The mechanic, Matt, took over and did an amazing job with the repairs. He also kept me up to date throughout the week on the progress and had it done in a timely manner. The young lady who did the estimate was also very professional (forgive me for forgetting your name). And, JP also finalized the walk through. Very professional.

I've seen a lot of customer service over the years but I have rarely seen a company work as a solid team and provide an exceptional experience. That's what Platinum Collision is, EXCEPTIONAL and AMAZING!!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Rafael Gale<//Name>< Rate>

The whole team there at platinum collision EastVale, is very responsive and helpful, they’ll update you with the progress every Tuesday and Thursday and they got my car done sooner then what I had expected! Definitely will be recommending you guys to everyone that needs auto body work done and electrical! Thanks a lot I’ll be comin back for all my auto body needs!

<rating>5< /rating><review>I had my car repaired at Platinum, they repaired my rear bumper after a rear end accident.  I got an estimate at another body shop that the insurance sent me to.  They estinated the repair would be about $400.  This did not sit right with me and I did not feel that the repair would be done properly.  I took it to Platinum because of my previous excellent experience with them and they fixed it properly.  The esimate was closer to $1700 not $400.  They dealt with the insurance and got everything taken care of.  I was having major problems attempting to get the insurance to even respond to me so the fact that Platinum stepped in and took over was a great help to me!  This is my second time using Platinum and they were fantastic again.  I will definately continue to utilize their services should I need any autobody work completed in the future!! Highly highly recommend.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcca7de67d7e7d:0xa77f2dfadc929b12</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing experience with platinum collision center! Appreciate how they walk you through absolutely everything, and help answer any questions that may concern you about your vehicle. The receptionist (i apologize, i forgot her name) was extremely kind, and made me feel assured that I was in good hands! Huge thank you to Matt for checking in and keeping me updated throughout the whole process!  My car looks amazing!  Would definitely recommend! Thank you for your service!</text>

<username>Devendra Sharma</username><Review>I was recommended to this body shop by a friend who always has her car repaired here and referred after me having nightmare experience with other body shop who after taking the advance was taking forever, I had to keep calling for updates with no progress. Finally I had to pick car as-is condition and take to this body shop. I am so happy I did!!!! They did such an amazing job.

Completely different experience here! Jhann took care of me from the beginning he was super helpful walking me through what was needed to be done and how much time they needed. I'm so happy with the job they did it looks brand new now! When they were done, the BMW looked like it came right off the showroom.

Without a doubt they take good care of you and would definitely recommend them!<//Review>< Date>

Platinum Collision Eastvale took great care of me. From taking in my car to picking it up it was all seamless. Having the Enterprise right next door is perfect.
The customer service was outstanding and I truly felt like they had my best interest. The communication was very consistent which made this experience that much better.
I would recommend Platinum to anyone who needs some work done on their vehicle. You are in “the best” hands with PCC.<//review>

< Review>
My wife took our Tesla X into the shop because she was hit by debris on the freeway. The car was brand new, maybe five months since we bought it. They fixed the bumper, the hood and the side door. The car was left with so many swirls all over.  We had to take in the car four times. The last time we just decided that we were going to contact our insurance to have another shop fix the car. The person who helped was rude, when I told him what we were going to do he was like do whatever you have to do with a very bad attitude his name was Matt. The last time the car was there they scratched one of the doors while at their shop. My wife noticed it so we addressed it with them, they didn’t even apologize nor said sorry this happens sometimes. All he did was got annoyed and said I’ll take the car to the back to fix it. They also left dust all over the drivers floor seat and entrance.  We are not picky people this is our first expensive car, we all work very hard for what we have and when you are paying a company to do work on something that is important to all your family and they do this type of work it is very unprofessional.</Review>

I made a good decision of choosing this body shop, we were dealing with a very abnormal Insurance company and they went out of their way to make sure they paid for the supplement work needed...Then our Highlander come out absolutely brand New, I would recommend anyone to this shop, they're very professional.
Our point person was a very professional Girl Amy..she was on top of things in updating us on every step despite the fact she was dealing with very evasive insurance company..After the tear down the even called me to see what lies beneath n after fixing the called me to see ..they're transparent and honest...keep up good job guys...</text>

<text>I saw their work 1st hand, after they took care of a fellow coworkers vehicle. I didn’t hesitate to take my car here after a hit and run damaged my vehicle.
The woman at the front desk always has a smile on her face and was able to answer most of my questions over the phone (any questions she didn’t personally know....she went and found out).
Keith and his team did BEAUTIFUL work. I know Keith is the face and voice of the team....but I want to say thank you to everyone who had a hand in fixing my car. I appreciate you all. You can’t even tell that there was ever any damage. (My vehicle isn’t brand new) they did a wonderful job paint matching. Keith called me frequently to update me and was very honest. (That goes a LONG WAY in my book). He was professional, honest, kind, understanding, and patient with all of my questions and concerns.
Hopefully I won’t have to use them again (as I hope to not be involved in another accident), however; should I need work done in the future, I would bring my vehicle back here in a heartbeat! I hope their business continues to grow and they are able to have more locations up and down the state. I will recommend them to all of my family and friends should they need repairs.<//text>< pictures>

Excellent and professional. Their shop is immaculate and they obviously take pride, as they should, in doing the job right. I had continuous updates on a fairly extensive repair from a collision I was in and my car looks and drives like brand new. They also were concerned about my personal well being which, again, shows they care.</text>

<text>I brought in my 2017 pilot for repair due to a minor rear end collision. I scheduled to bring the vehicle in over the phone. Upon arrival, I met with Jhann Baker and spoke to him about the damaged areas.  He performed an initial inspection and I provided him my insurance information.  He gave me a breakdown of the next steps that would follow. Jhann provided periodic updates to me until the repair was complete.  He was upfront on the time frame and was able to meet the projected completion date. When I arrived to pick up the vehicle, I was greeted by Jhann once again. He showed me all of the areas that were replaced.  I enjoyed the team’s professionalism throughout the whole process and their quality of work definitely shows.  If I am in need of future auto body repairs, I would definitely return to platinum collision centers.<//text><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I don’t know where to start but WOW talkin about restoration! Katie,Crystal and the big boss Jan, and the rest of the team at Platinum-Eastvale, thank you so much for restoring my baby! I came in scheduled through Geico, Katie greeted me at the door and sooner then you know it I was off with the rental! Although there was some quiet confusion with the insurance as too what damages are covered, but my man Jan stepped in and hooked it up and said I wanna help you out and let’s get this baby lookin right! The whole team there at platinum collision EastVale, is very responsive and helpful, they’ll update you with the progress every Tuesday and Thursday and they got my car done sooner then what I had expected! Definitely will be recommending you guys to everyone that needs auto body work done and electrical! Thanks a lot I’ll be comin back for all my auto body needs!

<user_name>Brianne Borninkhof<//user_name><text>Our brand new truck was hit while parked. What a hassle right? Platinum Collision took all the hassle out of having to have it repaired and all the little things that go with it. The estimate was quick and turned over to our insurance quickly, once that was completed, our truck was dropped off for repairs and finished before they estimated it to be done. Enterprise dropped my rental car off directly to me at Platinum, which was beyond convenient with 4 kids. I received updates each day through email on the status of repairs, and everyone I encountered was professional, and friendly.  The shop is clean and organized.  Customer service is top notch with great communication each step of the way. When my truck was finished I returned the rental back to Platinum, and picked up my truck looking just like when we drove it off the lot. Thank you so much, Katie, Crystal, Matt, and the rest of the Collision Crew!</text><Rating>5</Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dcca7de67d7e7d:0xa77f2dfadc929b12<//Gmap_id>< date>

Platinum collision has been amazing. Everyone i came into contact with has been helpful and professional. They explained the process and kept me informed the entire time my vehicle was being worked on. They have enterprise car rental on sight and even helped carry my daughters car seat for me from vehicle to rental. Would definitely recommend to family and friends.</text>

Convenient that the rental car place is on site and it made the process go much faster than expected.

They did a great job! Blended my paint I couldn’t tell the difference from the repair and factory paint. Finished the job 3 days ahead of schedule.

My car was also washed inside and out,  nice surprise when I picked it up.

Knock on wood that I don’t, but if I do get into another accident I will definitely go back to Platinum Collision Center!<//review>

Everything from the first phone call to picking up my car all finished was handled with such professionalism and care. We are in a very different time in our world right now and everyone at Platinum was so caring. Katie did such an amazing job handling every little detail, including my rental car. Thank you, Platinum Collision Center for taking such great care of my car and me!</Text>

From the moment I dropped the car off to the moment I picked it up, they treat you like part of the Platnium family and keep you in the loop every step of the way! You know your car is done right and by professionals. The Platnium Way! Nice that they have Enterprise rental car, as convenient partners right their to help you on your way. And they estimate three days and were done a day faster! Front counter staff and mechanics all were friendly and knowledgeable!<//Review>

Their friendliness, professionalism, customer service, and quality are unmatched in a world where those values are hard to find. I brought my Tesla in with rock damage from a person that didn’t care that they were peppering the road and other cars with debris. Luckily I got photos and they will now get a large bill for repairs.

Back to PCC though. Just saw my car and couldn’t be happier. It looks even better than the day I got it. New glass, new sensors, new chrome, new paint - all the things that make it look amazing.

Thank you Platinum. I will refer you to everyone I know and if I’m ever in the need for car repairs, you will be my choice.</text>< GmapID>

Front desk girl was unwelcoming, looked like she had an attitude when we came in. Estimator Ryan looked like he didn't want to be there, but looked at our vehicle. Didn't drop off vehicle, because they seemed like they could could care less if I did or didn't. I'd just be just another dollar to them.</Review>

<review>Whether you want to bring in your Maserati or your Honda...like I did... you get the same amazing service. Everyone is extremely helpful, super nice, and mindful of providing excellent customer service. I drove all the way from OC because I know Platinum Collission gets the work done.

I took in my Honda Pilot and they repaired all the damage so well my car looks new.

When I picked up my car I noticed they even washed my car. SCORE!

To makes things even better, they have an Enterprise Rental Service Office in their building...NICE!

No need to wait for your rental car arrive or wait around. The owner of Platinum Collission has definitely thought of everything.

Excellent service! Thank you Platinum Collission for the amazing job.</review>< Pictures>

< review>
Platinum Collision Repair exceeded my expectations which is hard to do. PCC provided me a level of customer service from like the good old days when life was so much more simpler. From my first call I was treated like a V.I.P. They had their own tow service pick up my Model S Tesla promptly and from there on it was like I was staying at a 5 star hotel. When I arrived  I walked through the service stalls to the reception...backwards through a shop really. Most companies today due to liabilities would not allow a customer to walk through its shop floor. Anyway, the shop was so  extra clean you could practically eat off the floor. When we made it to the receptionist at the front of the building I was offered refreshments, water soda, coffee...really! I was then introduced to Crystal, my personal service support staff.
In the four weeks I worked with Crystal it was like being the CEO of a large company and she was my personal administrative assistant. Crystal handled every detail from working with Tesla Corporation for parts to my insurance company over budgets. She was always one step a head of me in communicating repair  status.
Check this out.  My insurance budgeted for used parts since my car was nearly six years old. PCC charged my insurance company only for used parts, but installed new OEM parts for me at the same price!
When I picked up the car (BTW mintly detailed to perfection) I got a walk around from Jan, one of the managers. Honestly, he gave me the time and attention as if I was part of his family. He showed me pictures on his cell phone on the progress of the repairs to my car! You would have thought it was his car not mine!! He took the time to educate me on all the meticulous details that went into fixing my “Baby.” I so appreciated the education and the special attention. Thank you Jan and Crystal and for the entire PCC staff for an amazing, headache free experience.
To future customers, you shouldn’t be surprised at this level of service however...There was a new Bentley being towed in right behind my car!
This is my first ever post for any company. As a business owner myself my hats off to PCC for an exceptional business model.</review>

< review>
Brought my Tesla Model 3 here and they were fantastic! Best customer service experience. The owner Tom is cool and down to earth. Taylor was very helpful in dealing with the insurance/rental at the very beginning. I was afraid my Model 3 repair would take over a month or longer due to the high demand. They finished the job in less than three weeks!! Stephen and Jhann were great walking me through how the repairs were conducted and how they went above and beyond to fix my car in a timely manner when I picked it up.

Originally found this auto shop through Tesla’s list of certified repair shops. This place was very professional and they make sure to treat you like a VIP. The text message updates on the progress of the repair was a huge plus. Highly recommend this place for Tesla owners.< /review>

<text>1st class service from start to finish. The communication was the best, the follow through throughout the process was top notch and at the end of this journey was just as professional as the beginning. When you walked into their shop they all created you with a smile and their professionalism was very appreciated. I really hope I never have to use them again because you never want to get into an accident but if I did, I highly recommend them. And for anyone looking for a body shop to put your car or truck back  together Platinum Collision is your ONLY choice. And remember, they may or may not be a little more expensive then most but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I for one, want my car treated as good as I was so there is no other place I would go.</text>< Pictures>

We were referred to platinum from our insurance company. They made the experience less traumatic. They kept us posted all the way through the process. In addition we had access to application that provided us up-to-date information at our fingertips. Periodically regret telephone calls providing us detailed status updates. There were a few delays because of parts and what have you. Again Collision communicated regularly and we were very pleased with the finished product.< /Text>

Very easy experience. As the work progressed they kept me updated by text. more damage was found than was on the original estimate. The extra work was included and the invoice updated. All concerns were taken care of. The job was completed early ,and looks great thanks the shop is clean and looks great. I would of expected dust and dirt all over ,but they kept it clean and do a great job.<//text>

From the initial phone call with Crystal to Raul going over what I would be expecting in the process of repairing my vehicle to receiving my car completed, outstanding!

The customer service is excellent and I got constant updates on status of vehicle. I will never go anywhere else again. 👍🏼</text>

<Text>They kept me informed at every step of the repair. They worked at an approximate delivery date of 10/25/18. To my surprise they sent me notifications of when it went in paint shop so I figured ready a couple days early. Then on 10/19/18 in the morning they notified me that the car would be ready for pickup at 5:00 pm that day. That is 6 days earlier the the original completion date. The car looks great and the people there are all very friendly and helpful. I recommend them for all body work.</Text>< Pictures>

Although my vehicle was not repaired at Platinum Collision Center in Eastvale due to total loss, the service received from the staff was exceptional!! Crystal at the front desk is very personable and professional. If in the future I would have a need for a repair shop, I'd definitely come here.< /Text>

Amazing people, courteous and it appears that their main purpose is to please the customer. My TESLA was in a fender bender and was in the shop for over a month due to the delay in getting the parts from TESLA They kept me in the loop every step of the way. The manager Jahnn kept me informed almost on a daily basis as to the progress of the repair.  The repair was a  job very well done<//Review>

The stuff is very friendly and helpful, they went extra miles for me to resolve my rental car issue with enterprise car rental. The repair was completed within the promised time frame and the quality is superior! Definitely recommend!</text>

From my first contact with the owner, which was on a Sunday, I got all my questions and concerns answered immediately.  I can't say enough positive things about the whole process.  I wouldn't go anywhere else if I had to do it over again.  Each person I dealt with was above and beyond the best out there.  I checked over 7 places out prior to making my selection (only to provide the other driver with prices in case he wanted to go outside of insurance).  You will be well taken care of every step of the way with Platinum Collision Centers.< /review>

<text>Considering the unfortunate circumstances required to interact with this company, everything went quite well. They kept me apprised of any changes to my situation and even managed to deliver the car fully repaired ahead of their original, tentative date. If needing repairs to your vehicle (especially a Tesla), I would highly recommend them.<//text>< Pictures>

We were very happy with our experience at Platinum Collision Centers in Eastvale. The staff was courteous, professional, and patient with all my questions. My husband and I appreciated the graphic handout detailing all the steps involved with the repair process. I never realized what all goes into getting the job done and how thorough Platinum is at accomplishing this. The results were fantastic. My husband is very pleased with the outcome of his truck. Thank you Jhann Baker and your fabulous crew!<//text>

My truck stays clean because of the mobile detailing membership that I purchased which again I would say is 100% worth it. You always get good service when people are passionate about their work.</Review>< pics>

< review>
i choose to have Platinum Collision repair my 2016 Ford F250 diesel Truck, it was in bad shape after being T-BONED, and having 14K in damaged, Based on the reviews on Yelp and Google on this body shop i had it towed there, Honestly i was prepared to have it repaired and trade it in on a new truck, knowing they never are the same after that big of a repair, I say I was very impressed when i picked it up, I could not tell it was even in a accident, drove the same, looks great, as any Ford owner knows the gaps on these trucks from the factory are terrible, know the whole right side is perfect, I would highly recommend this shop to everyone, customer service was great, but the repairs far exceeded my expectations, I have no plans to trade it in know,  Thanks Platinum Collision for the great service and work.<//review>

Fortunately I don’t have much experience with auto body repair shops, but expected the worst to be honest. Stumbled across platinum through a search, and couldn’t have been happier. The staff was great, prices were fair, and more than anything they did what they said! Easy and fast, thank you for the experience!< /review>

<Review>The service, professionalism and care at Platinum Collision Center were all superb.  The entire staff, from the receptionist to the owner (Tom), consistently provided excellent service beyond my expectations.

I had a minor fender-bender on my Tesla and needed to have the rear bumper repaired.
The estimate process was quick and easy.  Jackie meets you at the front desk in the most friendly and helpful manner.  Veronica assesses the damage thoroughly and provides the estimate.  They set up an immediate date for my repair and even made arrangements for me to get  a rental car at the site.  All I had to do was drop off my car.

Jhann, the manager, keeps you informed about the entire repair process.  He is very knowledgeable and experienced.  He works with the insurance company to get the repairs covered and completed as quickly as possible.  When my insurance company, State Farm, became less than willing to cover the necessary repairs, Jhann effectively communicated with me and State Farm to explain each itemized cost.  In the end, all repairs were beautifully done and covered with a lifetime warranty.

I am extremely satisfied with my experience at Platinum.   Thank you for the excellent service.  I highly recommend Platinum Collision Center in Eastvale!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Was directed to work with this shop by my insurance company to help correct problems with repairs that were done on our vehicle when we lived in Seattle 7 or 8 years ago.

After the initial assessment, Jhann and the team made minor fixes to correct the major problems (water leakage) without getting insurance involved.

I am very grateful to this team for taking the time to help us solve a lingering problem.< /Text>< response>

Love Phong(owner)!!! Been rockin' with Nail Fashions since I was 18 and I'm 34 now. I move to WA state so I don't get to frequent as often. When I do come to Cali, Nail Fashions is the ONLY place I go. Never disappointed. Barbie Pink play this time!!#💗💕💗💕<//review>

<text>Like it but definitely don't like the service the people are rude actually they are very very rude you have to be very patient if you want your pedicure and your nails done like the work but I think they need to be training how to treat people Rude rude I hope that's not their signature to be rude.<//text><rate>1<//rate><gmap_id>0x80c3533a51c254dd:0x38148afd4789c1d8< /gmap_id></record>

<review>I absolutely love the lady who did my nails today i dont expect perfection on a design but i am impressed...but i must say not only was she kind and soft spoken but clean and methodical with her work i have always been fascinated by their work, of all the salons ive been to this is the only one that ive seen that respect and value their customers. I hadforgotten about a cut on a cuticle that burned when she cleaned my nails but she remembered the reaction and was verry gentle with that finger... i do recommend them yes they are busy, so call ask about waite times not just if they take walk ins, or schedule an appointment....< /review><Response>None< /Response><username>Drk Butterfly< /username>< Date>

The first time it was the older man who I’m guessing is in “charge” of the nail shop and did a great job. But once my second time he rushed throughout my entire set and did a horrible job. I understand if you’re done with your day or tired just let someone else do my nails don’t waist my time and my money so they could come out ugly.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0ZZHWK3jt-SDIvhBvU_AvFgVxH51vf0Jznn-o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Clean 👍 Made an app so they took me right away 👍.

Customer service NEEDS ALOT OF WORK! Pedicure was done in like 5min 🙄.

For pedicure,  ask for Kim, shes the best! She pays attention to detail, and focuses on her job.  Very nice person! The only day I was not satisfied was when she wasn't there so I had a different lady do my pedi, and she made me bleed, so if Kim's not there I don't go.< /text>

Everyone there are nice. I love the way they do nails and the prices are affordable. The only thing is since the prices are at a reasonable price that place gets packed.  They do the best they can to help everyone so it sometimes sucks when we make an appointment because they try to be fair. But hey I love it there!!  Nancy does amazing designs. I'm actually

If I could give this place no stars I would. Came in and they had a lot of people waiting- the owner asked me if I could come the next day that he would schedule me in for 2 PM so I made an apt. I come in the next day, arrived 15 mins before my apt, it was 2:15 and I was still not seated. People that were walk ins kept getting seated. I got up and asked the owner if I was almost going to get called at it was 2:15 already and he said that he has to seat the people that have been waiting here for a long time- even though I had an apt. Horrible customer service! They need a better system when it comes to appointments. What is the point of scheduling apt if you are still going to wait for everyone who has been waiting to get seated? Defeats the purpose! I don’t think they understand the concept of scheduling appointments. Will never come here!<//text>

The owner of this place is very unprofessional, when I made a complaint about my nails he said to come back tomorrow to fix them???!!??? Excuse me who lets someone walk out with messed up nails? They use very cheap Arylic powder please don’t waste your money! You will be back in a week your welcome! (:<//review>

<Text>The man at the front is extremely rude and takes no responsibility for anything at the shop. When simply asking a question he gave unnecessary attitude. You can make appointments, but if someone walks in minutes before your appointment, they will take that person instead and just tell you you have to wait because they need to make money. Appointments are completely pointless. Extremely bad customer service on all ends, will never go back.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1565301042730<//Time>< user_name>

< Review>
One of my worst nail experiences! My pedicure literally took less than 15 min. The lady cleaned nothing, the paint chipped the next day. When I mentioned that and asked how are all my cuticles cleaned she ignored it, didn't even scrub my feet.  Then when I got up to pay she was looking at my receipt as if expecting a tip! My 5 year old niece could have done a better job! What a waste. So much for trying a new place. Never again.< /Review>

this is my goto nail shop, i go on a weekly/2 week basis and the prices are very good . I get gel polish and a manicure for $30. I always make an appointment with Rose because she does a really good job. It is definitely always busy but the prices and work is the reason for it .< /review>

<review>If I could rate 0 stars, I would. This is the worst nail place that I have been to! I got acrylic nails done FIVE DAYS ago and I was extremely upset with the results. My nails already looked like they were already growing out and I literally just got them done. The only reason I left without getting them redone is because they were closing. I had asked if I could come in the next day to get them redone for free,  and surely they said yes. I go in the next day and they literally did the exact same thing that they did the previous day. When I had told them that I didn't like how they looked like they were already growing out, they told me that they wouldn't do it for me. And now my nails look like they've been growing out for TWO WEEKS and I got them redone FOUR DAYS ago. Not only are they grown out after a short period of time, but they are also chipping badly and I've never had acrylic nails chip. Definitely don't recommend going here. Worst place ever!< /review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

Rose is the best!!! She takes her time and is very detailed into what she's doing! Everyone else is good also! Yes they can get a little busy at times and it made seem like they are taking forever but if you see the amount of clients they have coming in specially during the weekend you would actually see that they are perty fast! However i do suggest you make an appointment, just makes your life easier lol Really good prices! I love this shop!

I think this place customer service sucks!!! Prices are competitive and manicurest are good... but nothing over and beyond. Every time I go always something... like right now I came last night the owner tells me they open at 10... I ask for a 10 appt he says no come 1030. So I come at 1030 and he's is doing a manicure... so I guess I'll f** just wait.. does anyone know another good nail salon?<//text>

They do terrific nail work. Too bad customer service sucks. I had an appointment for both my daughter and myself which was made day before. We show up 5 minutes early. 30 minutes later still not seated. When I asked how much longer Phan said he did not know and to have a seat. Sorry bruh I'm paying you $$$. Time is money and I'm out.<//review>

<Text>I've been coming here for about 11-12 yrs and I've have gotten different experiences but recently I learned how to work with management. It all depends on who does your work. I get my pedicure done with Kim and I love it!. I have fungus on my toe nails and she does an amazing job on my nails. I call and make an appointment usually midday because that's when they arent as busy and i get pampered like crazy. Kim works on my for about 1:30 hrs. Honestly you just need to make an appointment for a time when they are not too busy and explain your needs to them. If you come when it busy you will hate this place, if you get someone who you feel isnt doing a good job request someone else. They do get alot of walkins during peak hrs. I drive about 30mins now to get my nails done here.

<text>I use to like this place . I followed them from when they where at the carasoul mall they can care less about you and what you need done. The owner has the worst attitude and is not professional at all Nancy on the other hand is really good ! But I will no longer come here simply becuase of the customer service .<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>If i could put 0 it would be 0 stars , they gave me a horrible fungus on my hands , they do not sanitize their tools and when you have any question the owner is extremely rude , i am disgusted by this place i had never caught anything and i had to take antibiotics and a cream for the skin condition i caught with them.</Text><GmapID>0x80c3533a51c254dd:0x38148afd4789c1d8</GmapID></record>

< review>
I got to the Amigo Room around 9 p.m. and it was rather inviting. I liked the decor and the vibe. It's a small space, but the booth setup provided what felt like a little privacy that allowed for talking with friends. Until a little later that hour when the DJ started. The volume was up so high that talking (or hearing anyway) became very difficult. I would anticipate that at a bar more suited to dancing, but the Amigo Room is more of a tiny, low-key, pseudo-Mexican cocktail bar that would be better left to those who want to sit and drink. However, that being said, it's not a great place to go if you appreciate a good drink. I was warned by more the one person in the party we were joining not to order the drinks that they had chosen, and my whiskey sour was all sour and nearly no whiskey. Overall, the Amigo Room had some charm, but probably not enough to get me back there.</review>

<Text>Gets five stars. Not because it's the ritz, or location, or any fancy shmancy reasons. But because it's as billed. Run down old motel on Hollywood Blvd. with hardwood floors, updated with band aids. And CHEAP. Staff is friendly, room ready early, not here to party in my room or at the pool. Here to sight see and have a safe place to lie down after universal city and walk of fame. Will be back again.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80db1b148f835a93:0xad430bf912a7cd54< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is a place I have been to many times before, but not recently. I write this now because there is a new sheriff in town and he did time at Mikkeller DTLA. He scrapped the previous, anemic tap list and immediately installed the real deal on tap. I had a English pale from Yorkshire Square in Torrance and a Reissdorf Kolsch - an actual Kolsch from Cologne, fresh! This may easily be the new king in town when it comes to craft beer (not that that is saying much, unfortunately) and there are plans for more. Keep it up!</text>

I meet my coworkers at this light-filled spot so we can get a bit of work in before we carpool in the morning. There aren’t outlets, so no one stays there long, but if there were I’d sit and order coffee all day from the attentive baristas. There is a good selection of healthy snacks if you neglected to pack your lunch.</Text>

A great option for your lunchtime playbook. The sandwiches are freshly made on real, hearty bread and very tasty. The service is very quick and I’ve never seen much of a line at lunch even when nearby places are very crowded. In addition to lunch options this place is also a grocery, so there are lots of other things you can pick up while you’re there, including a selection of baked goods at the register. The staff are all very friendly.<//text>

I love love love love the ice coffee and the lovely atmosphere inside. So much awesome food to look at and to eat, a cute little cafe space, and beautifully curated bouquets.

The atmosphere in here is great. It's super cute and it mirrors what I imagine the brand stands for, local, quality, healthy food. It's a great place to meet a friend or go alone. I love just sitting in here, would be great to read, draw, or escape from the office for a bit.

It's probably my favorite iced coffee in the city, and super nice staff.

They clearly focus on their curation. It's great to walk into a place and feel that anything you pick up here, has already been decided upon thoughtfully by a passionate staff member of the brand.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>Small Foods is a cool spot for most foods you'd need.  There's a sushi station/counter that is impressive for its size.  Just grab a small snack or meal and you're good to go.  This place is also good to meet up or just hangout for coffee.</text></record>

Coffee is great depending on the batista (not by any means consistent) but overall I've had a great experience here, staff are nice, the sandwiches are great. The breakfast sandwich is the best. Salads are not as good as they used to be.</text>

This is a great place to have a glass of wine or beer and a hearty snack after work.  The people are friendly, the beer selection is good, and they have pretty good food too.  I'd prefer a few more food choices, but it's a small place (!) and they put effort into making it a very comfortable place to visit.<//Review>

This is the small version of Whole Foods hence the name Small Foods.... i'm kidding but not really.

It's like the size of one section of Whole Foods concentrated on selling snacks, small packaged items, bottled beverages, fresh food/sandwiches/salads, and fresh coffee and tea.

I only go here to get a cup of coffee or buy a bottled beverage. They have the high quality, organic, unique, and good for you beverages. I love how some of it is local because I can't find that anywhere else. The people working here have been super friendly and awesome. They greet me every time and are super attentive.

Great shop to pick up a quick snack or drink!< /Text>

I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this place.  Small is located right across the street from my office so I'm here often, but it can be a drain on my wallet.  The sandwiches are really tasty and fresh, and I love their Four Barrel coffee, but spending $4 a day every morning one of these is tough.</Review>

A real gem. Just because a new Blue Bottle outlet has opened next door, don't overlook Small Foods. Most of the store is a healthy grocery outlet, including lots of lunch options, but the front is all Cafe. The coffee isn't quite Blue Bottle standard, but it's very close, and it's a little less pretentious proto-hipster (plus the lines are far shorter). The staff are awesome, especially the dude with two-tone hair who clearly has amazing taste in music. Coffee and croissant, with early Pink Floyd blasting out, is as San Francisco as it gets. No Wifi though, so don't expect to be productive.</text>

This little store has potential. It sometimes has some cool and exotic stuff; at other times sandwich meat rots on the shelves and foods good well beyond their expiry without being noticed.</review>

<review>It truly deserves a 1.5 start rating, but I'm feeling generous today so it gets the full 2 stars.  I had a turkey, cheese and avocado sandwhich was was just plain extra medium.  First of all it was premade and was sitting out so the avocado was starting to oxidize (turn brown). Overall it had zero taste, like none whatsoever.  All I tasted was bread.  On the plus side its a nice little quaint deli spot with the usual overpriced goods.<//review><Rate>2</Rate>< userid>

< Review>
I know I shouldn't shop at Small Foods, because everything is very pricey here, but the convenience of it makes it hard to resist.

I probably come here 3-4 times a week during my lunch breaks. The crowd is your usual SOMA crowd. They have a great selection of salads and sandwiches at their deli counter. I try to avoid the sushi because premade sushi tends to be awful, and this place is no exception.

The staff tends to be generally friendly, although you'll occasionally run across a very grumpy barista.

Overall, I'd recommend coming here for a quick bite or to pick up some flowers if needed. They used to have a wider assortment, but now it's all supplied by Farmgirl Flowers.</Review>

<Review>Save Mart (Oakdale Ca.)
This is my favorite, clean, well stocked plenty of up front parking. Vegetables and fruits always fresh. Meats well packaged and marked easy to see. Bakery delightful. Clerks always nice and informable  Masks required.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Generally reserve shopping at up scale food supply like Save Mart, for special occasions as income  has been impacted by the quarantine.
Going to a real meat counter reminds me how meat is supposed to be, same with seafood... Unfortunately my last splurge  on lobster an larger shrimp wasn't as inspired as I have  become pleased  with the quality SM
Maintains.  ½ of a 65$  meal had to be thrown out , I  am not refusing it very well could have been my preperation but at 60 years old this ain't my 1st fishing trip! haha
Management probably would have replaced or refunded the price but couldn't bring myself to complain if guilt wasn't clear.  Generally a terrific store in my opinion</text>

I have to review this place.
I needed a bathroom break and due to COVID-19 all gas station bathrooms are closed as are fast food ones.  So we stopped here to use the bathroom.  It was VERY clean!  THANK YOU for letting us stop in for a 'break'.
Also - the fried chicken smelled SOOOO GOOOOOOD!  In gratitude, we ordered chicken tenders and some spring slaw - DELISH!  Again, thanks for the great spur of the moment, surprise break and snack!  YUM!< /Text>

<Review>Gal working register 4 at 10:00 am 06-22-20 needs to learn to do her job better. She tossed my fruit almost throwing it at the bagger. She also combined my transaction with my fiancee when there was clearly a divide. Resulting in one card being charged for the entire transaction. I send a lot of money here.this was not okay.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Store is very well kept. All staff I've come in contact with are very nice. Aisles are neat and organized. They have a small floral section. Bakery with a variety of goodies. Fruit stand to squeeze your own fresh juice. Fruit, specialty waters, and vegetables all packaged cut up ready to go. Build a sandwich spot. Meat counter spotless with sea food... I'm a happy customer .</review>< pics>

Between the Oakdale location and the bigger store down the street from Ace we spend upwards of 800 $ a month, and close to each and every time we shop at these locations the overwhelming majority of the young checkers DO NOT say hello, or thank you at the end of each transaction. What ever happened to that procedure ? Never have this experience at Raley's in Oakdale and plan on shifting all our business in that direction for lower prices and as a matter of principle. Thank You Save Mart Management.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>To the good folks I know in store thanks for being normal and kind , but some of these employees need diversity training last night the checker made a back up call when I was only one in line she need a male there I guess to sell me some juice some cashiers scared to touch my money and most having great conversations to who's in front of me all of a sudden get dry and barely speak when I say hello and I'm next. Either uncomfortable or a lot of racism in them employee outfits.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x8090f9c3e4f7beed:0x6ca158248ecb702f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love this location.The store is so nice and clean everytime I go there.They always have whatever Im looking for.While I was there a young lady named melissa helped me out and went above and beyond to helo me find what I was looking for.Along the time spent helping me find what I was looking for I discovered she was pregnant and she was helping me to this extent with such a great attitude I was baffled.2 thumbs up to this young lady.10/10 would shop again.</review>

<review>I love the remodeled store! Juice bar, taco/nacho/burrito bar, improved deli, and of course the grill to order! They will cook anything in the meat department you bring them while you shop. Pick up a fresh made dinner and grocery shop at the same time! Or even call in your order and they'll have it ready at a specified time. Convenience, delicious meals, and variety all in one place.</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This Save Mart has great customer service and great selections of food. And the store is always clean.And in the meat area they will even cook your food on a grill it for you and cut meats for you.And have lots of fruits and veggies and even serve hot food and have delicious cakes and baked goods. I always get birthday cakes from them. But stuff can be very expensive but that is just Save Mart they are always somewhat pricy</text>

This store has the in store grill that you can take fresh meat over to and they will cook it right there on the spot. Or you can call ahead and they will have it ready for you to pick up and take home. Great for the days when you want really good food but don't want to go to a restaurant.< /Review>< pics>

<text>This store discriminated against me because of the way that I look! I would give this place zero stars if I could. The way I was treated was unbelievable. My wife wasn’t feeling well so she sent me in for her to grab a steak for dinner. I walked up to the meat, looked around, and realized I wasn’t sure which cut or type of steak she wanted. So I figured I would just walk back out to the car, which was about 100 feet outside the front door in plain sight and my wife sitting in it with the window down. I walked up to her and asked which steak I should get and she told me, so I went back into the store, walked straight back to where I had just been standing looking at the meats, I grabbed a steak and walked to the check out counter. As I’m setting my stuff down, a fellow customer accused me of stealing something when I first walked into the store. He said that I walked out without paying for anything when I went to ask my wife what to get and that he KNEW that I stole something. I was so offended, that I just told him to have the store check their cameras. But he kept on and on about how his father owned a grocery store and he knows how much theft hurts everyone, still accusing me of stealing AS IM PAYING FOR MY ITEM. I payed and turned to leave as this man keeps at it, asking the cashier if they’re just going to “let me leave.” The cashier looked at him and rudely said “well there’s nothing we can do about it.” I was flabbergasted. These people were all profiling me because of how I look!! My wife and I deal with this often because we are skinny, have missing teeth and tattoos. People have the audicity to treat us like we are drug addicts and they just get away with it. So here I am writing a review because I feel that this is the only way I can voice my concerns. I am a top google contributor and am responsible for reviewing businesses on a daily basis. I’ve never had to write a review quite like this before. I will be posting this review on yelp as well.< /text></record>

Great grocery store clean. Quality of produce is awesome. Little pricey but you pay for what you get every now and then they have some great deals on meat.</Review>

Amazing store. Its has a bakery, large wine area, deli foods, grill your meats for you. A big fancy store with many speciality items. A bit pricy for milk at $4.69 gal though. Walmart Market sells milk for $3.29.</Text>

The remodel has definitely given this location the upper hand in town. There are still a couple premium items I have to go to Raley's for but otherwise this is now my preferred place to shop.<//review>

<text>Noticeable difference in price and selection between this Oakdale store and the nearest store 12 miles away in Riverbank. Oakdale being the higher price with less selection.

< Review>
I have always had the best experience at the Oakdale Savemart ever since I moved to Oakdale in the year 2001. I am from the Bay Area and when I noticed most of all is everyone smiled all the time and when they ask you how you are they really mean it or they ask you what you're going to be doing for the weekend, they really want to know. I always look forward to going to Save Mart</Review>
