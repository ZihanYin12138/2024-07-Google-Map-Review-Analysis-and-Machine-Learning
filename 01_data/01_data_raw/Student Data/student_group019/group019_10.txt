<text>Both father and son are real good to their customers. Will go back there again. Also, their prices are not too high. Very reasonable for coral and fish. If you a fan of Red Sea product then this is a place you should go, although they sell other manufacturers. Some of the tanks could be cleaned up a bit,  it they are not too bad. The main display tanks are magnificent.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>About a year ago I purchased a tail spot blenny for Chad at Treasures of The Sea.  Since then, the blenny has been great!  I recently got the itch to upgrade to a much larger tank.  I returned here and Chad set me up with a great deal on a Red Sea Max system and even delivered it.  I'm looking forward to coming back for all of my saltwater and freshwater fish needs.< /Review>< pics>

<text>New owners have done incredible job cleaning up the store and adding new fish much more coral and better lighting than ever.  The knowledge and friendliness of the owners is amazing and makes Treasures of the Sea the best place by far I have shopped for all my tropical fish needs.  Prices are good too.  I will be a customer for a long time at this store.< /text>< Date>

This is the best saltwater store I have found in the Riverside area. When you enter the store, it is obvious that the owners know what they are doing - it is well stocked with healthy fish, gorgeous corals and beautiful anemones, and the aquariums are in pristine showcase condition. I will be thrilled if I can get my aquarium to look half as good!

The owner is extremely knowledgeable and won't encourage you to buy something that you don't need, and will help you to find solutions to fit your budget. I brought in a water sample and he tested it for me and discovered that my salinity was too high (despite my hydrometer saying it was okay). My Instant Ocean Hydrometer (which I purchased at a different store) was very inaccurate. He helped me by calibrating my hydrometer allowing me to continue to use it, saving me some money from having to replace it. This is just a small sample of the wonderful service that I have received at Treasures of the Sea and More.

You can trust that you will find expert advice, top quality products and healthy livestock at this store. It is clear that this store is run by people who have a passion for saltwater/reef systems.</text>

We recommend that store to all citizens of Riverside city and county. The owner was gracious enough to educate us, explain the process of having a salt water fish tank, and how to take care of the fish. What the owner did not know is that I have been a scuba instructor for many years, have had many fish tanks all of my life, graduated with a BS in Biology, and never once, attempted to take advantage of me, or my wallet.

The owner has gained my business, and my trust. Something very difficult to earn this days.

I have had 1 60gallon salt water fish tank for the last 10 years.  I know what I am doing, so does the owner.

Congratulation to Treasures of the sea!!!!!</Review>

I agree that they are more expensive than other fish stores; however, you have to take into consideration that they have to drive far to get their livestock and then turn around and re-sell them.  Also, they have some of the nicest corals and fish I've seen in the Riverside area.  I purchase my livestock here, simply because I want to see what I'm paying for, versus purchasing on the internet.

And they do give discounts.  Ask the owner for a punch card.  He will give you a discount on your next purchase.

Go there when it's not busy and the owner will make time for you.  Otherwise, get in line...like everything else in life.< /text>

Arriving at the store there was a written sign saying that they would be opening late..... so my family and i went to eat to kill time until they opened. A couple hours later they still had not opened! This was very disappointing due to the fact that we drove pretty far and were let down. While peeking inside the store, we saw a bunch of other hand written signs taped up by the door giving us the impression that they do this often!< /review>

<Text>Higher prices than most places. The person assisting us had no idea what the prices where. There are no discounts if u purchase a lot of stuff, like most mom n pop stores. And they tried over charging us. Always look at your receipt. Save your money and dont come down to this store!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

For salt water its good, but for tropical don't waste your time. Not a whole lot of tropical fish. Had Endlers mixed with normal guppys =/ thats never good. Any good fish store know those 2 should never be mixed due to breeding issues.< /text>

This place use to be a great place to find healthy fish but I belive they may have changed  ownership . When I went in the store was dirty , smelled bad , had dead fish that I could had been lingering in the aquarium , and the beta fish were living in horrendous conditions . Overall I was disgusted by the lack of care provided for the animals in this store !< /Review>

October 1, 2017
Gala occasion uprighting and setting the 60,000 lb Lady Buddha statue at the Bat Nha Temple, 4717 E 1st Street, Santa Ana. The lift was done safely and efficiently by DeWolfe Crane Service. The only problem was that DeWolfe Crane Service was defrauded out of $3608.30 by Holly Pham and Sam Uong- Chi Tha Chua Bat Nha.
We discounted our invoice to help reduce the cost to the Temple and I volunteered to work myself for free, they would only pay the wages of our employees, nothing for the rental of all the equipment.
Holly and Sam conspired with TL Construction/VN Steel to create a situation where it would be very difficult for DeWolfe Crane Service to collect from the Temple because we were working for TL Construction who was under contract from the temple. Holly Pham said the Temple had no money and that she had to give them $1000.00 in order for them to pay the wages of our employees ( I believe she lied about that) and Sam Uong said that we would have to take the Temple to court if I wanted to be paid for the work we did. I believe that the Buddhist people are fair people but for the rest of my life, whenever I see a Buddha statue or temple, I will be reminded of the people that betrayed my trust and defrauded me and my family.
Sincerely, James DeWolfe< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Old people have not changed to new ones on the 1St line.
But I still have an evening of sleep with Phat Ngoc's old lady covered in the bridge to help Phat talk about the street.
Not even a vegetarian friend, especially, the food in the bowl is not so delicious. The end of the year also has the same flowers.

This place is very professional, knowledgeable, and very precise in their work. The tint itself truly reduces the heat that makes it's way into the vehicle, it also reduces the glare of lights especially when driving. It also looks very cool 😎.</Review>

Freddy from CenCal Tinting did my windows and did an awesome job. He was very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. He did an amazing job on my windows and even the windshield too which can be a real challenge. I definitely recommend and will be coming back for any future business. Thanks again!

<Text>Got my windows tinted by Cen Cal Tinting and I was not disappointed! I mostly spoke with Daniel and he was so friendly and knowledgeable. They really put a lot of time into the job they did and it shows.

I got my SUV done here and they did an amazing job! I got the i3 ceramic film which is by far AMAZING! I can feel almost no heat whatsoever especially with this hot weather. Might have to go get my windshield done soon. Daniel and everything there are so kind and helpful! Highly recommend.<//Review>

They respond quickly to texts, very informative about the services and brands they use in house. Great warranty and high grade tint. I purchased the i3 ceramic tint for my vehicle and it came out outstanding. Stays very temperate in my vehicle in this hot fresno weather. Upon the tint drying, there are no visible bubbles and or film peeling from corners. They work on a lot of high end vehicles and no car is a challenge. Highly recommend and look forward to using them again.</review><Rate>5</Rate><user_id>106572056585048411150<//user_id>< Date>

<review>You get what you pay for. Service was great, car looks amazing, very professional and informative. Freddy and the crew did a phenomenal job on my Scion tC. I went in, not knowing how tints work or the variety of tints they had available and they helped me get a better understanding of how they work and choosing a tint that I wanted. First time getting a vehicle tinted and I’m glad it was with these guys. Definitely plan on taking future cars with them. Shout out to Freddy, Daniel, Carlos, and the rest of the crew that worked on my car, it’s much appreciated.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>From the time I called and scheduled, to the moment the installer left, Cen Cal Mobile Tinting was friendly and professional. Daniel was early to my appointment, which was not a problem for me. He was incredibly friendly, yet professional, and knowledgable. He taught me a couple things about his job and the process, so I could have a better understanding. It makes a huge difference in customer service when you're dealing with someone who is smiling and able to have a casual conversation. I treat my car like a baby, so I was appreciative of how Daniel was gentle, clean, and accurate as he worked. I had my two front windows tinted with the ceramic 5%, and I love how it looks and feels on the outside and inside. I will definitely use this company whenever I need tinting in the future!< /Review><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

When I dropped the car off, I figured it would take most of the day - I was thrilled to get a call a few hours later that it was done and ready to be picked up!
The quality is well worth the price. I could have paid less somewhere else, but I doubt there would have been the attention to detail and I know I wouldn’t have gotten the high quality product that was installed.
I will definitely be recommending them to anyone that asks!< /Review>< Pictures>

Fantastic work and great customer service. I must say I had the hardest time finding Cen Cal. But once I did it was the best decision I made because I called 8 different window tinting places and they were all about the money and how high they can go. Cen Cal gives you the lowest prices and allows you to chose any service you'd like when you get there. I was done ✔within an hour!
I know remarkable right?
They guarantee their work 💪so I'm extremely happy! Nice Job!!!😉< /text>

Booked my tint online - was super simple and easy. They provided recommendations on what would look best for my car, and were reasonably priced. Got the ceramic coating, 25% back and 35% front windows. I have an unbeatable warranty on my tint, too! Highly recommend Cen Cal Tinting if you’re in the Fresno or Clovis area.<//text>

I was very pleased with Daniel and Hector. I needed a tint removal and wanted to apply a ceramic tint. Daniel answered all of my questions and got me scheduled the very next day.  Hector and Daniel were very professional and are highly recommended by me. I could not be happier with the tint. I did appreciate that they take pride in their work at this business and offer a life time warranty. The quality of the tint they put on my new 2021 Nissan Rogue Plantinum is excellent.< /review>

<review>Very professional, great customer service, overall good experience. Still a little early to comment on the quality because I have to wait 2 weeks to see if some small air bubbles on 1 window dissappear.  But I'm pretty confident if they don't that Daniel and the guys will take care of it.  Love the way my Titan looks now. Should have done it a long time ago. My wife's Flex is next.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Went and got my tint done yesterday and my experience was great! Daniel was so profession and friendly. This was my first time getting a tint so he was very helpful with explaining everything. The tint itself looks amazing. They took their time to make sure everything came out perfect. The price was fair for the work they did. Just want to say thanks again to all the guys that worked on my car yesterday, im so very happy with the outcome😊</review>< Pics>

<text>I recently purchased a 2021 Kia Forte at Future Kia of Clovis and They highly recommended Cen Cal Tinting. I saw them on Facebook and decided to give them a call. After speaking with Daniel to get information and a quote. I scheduled my appointment for Saturday morning. I got lost finding the place but they were so helpful on the phone to get me there. I was not sure what kind of tint to get. I was shown the different tints and levels of darkness by James who was so helpful and he made my decision so easy. I trusted them after meeting them and I knew the car was in good hands. They called me when the car was ready to pick-up and I love how it turned out!!! They are the best place to get your car windows tinted!!!< /text></record>

Freddy said the inside of my car should be much cooler after tinting with the i3 and he was right...it's like having a shade tree following you where ever you drive ...<//review>

Extremely happy with CenCal tinting! They took their time answering questions when I requested a quote, set up an appointment to fit my busy schedule and even sent me a reminder text. On the day of tinting I dropped it off and it was finished way faster then I expected with great quality too! Highly recommend them<//Review>

I loved that they texted me instead of calling since i don't answer numbers i don't know. The texts were friendly and professional, bonus, there was no pressure to get my windows tinted by them. The place was a little hard to find but other then that, everything was great. It did end up costing me more then quoted but that's only cuz after talking to Fred(i think that's his name), i decided to go with some higher quality tinting to fit my needs better(keep heat out, make it so i can't be seen as much and keep out headlights/outside light). When i picked up my car i was floored. It looks so good, they did an amazing job. I would do recommend them.< /review>< Pics>

This place was great! The customer service at their temporary shop is awesome. The guys treated me like family and the job was done in a timely manera plus the quality was amazing. Make sure you ask about their ceramic tint, if you’re going to tint your vehicle make it worth it and get ceramic.< /review>

Highly recommend Daniel to anyone looking for a great tint job at a reasonable price and with great customer service!

<Date>1615234070277< /Date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Daniel was very professional. As I was looking for a local tint place, I called one and it proceeded me to a voicemail, in which I left. I never received a call back from Darkside. The next day I saw Cen Cal ad on top of the google list and reached out. I immediately received a text indicating they were on the other line and he would call me back. Daniel from Cen Cal called back in less than 5 minutes willing to take my car in or schedule a home visit on Sunday or Monday morning at  7AM. I took the advantage of them coming to my home and throughout the week, they text me reminders of my appointment. Daniel and the other installer was on time at 7am. They did the install in less than 2 hours and left me with some great information, along with my warranty. I look forward to them installing tint on my 4runner as well. Thanks again Cen Cal Mobile Window Tinting!< /Review>< pictures>

I was looking to have my windows tinted on my vehicle. I didn't know which company to use until my neighbor had their vehicle done. I spoke with Daniel, company owner,  he gave me an estimate on my vehicle. He explained to me all types of tinting and what he recommended for my vehicle. He was very knowledgeable and his work was excellent.</Text>

Very friendly and professional. They were done with an appointment before mine so I was able to get my car done much earlier. Product looks great! I definitely recommend them if anyone is looking to get their windows tinted. They are a mobile service so I didn’t have to waiting in a shop waiting room or drop off my car. After shopping around a bit, their prices were competitive from others and product is backed with lifetime warranty.< /Text>

Just bought a new car yesterday and called them to get tint completed on our Mazda CX-5. We got a next day appointment and they even came to pick up the car and bring it back due to us not having a big enough garage. Also, very knowledgeable on the phone which is always a plus on trying a new place! Great prices and the results are fantastic! We would highly recommend!<//text>

<Text>Daniel made it easy to schedule an appointment. The day of the appointment he kept me updated on his arrival. I was even given a 6 minute eta which made it perfect since I was napping with a newborn. Daniel was friendly and easy to talk to and answered any questions I had. Definitely will use this service again.

Overall, excellent customer service with outstanding professionalism! Still a bit too early to say about the quality, but from what I am seeing on my wife's car that I took in today (Saturday, May 22, 2021), it is looking great thus far, so I'm sure quality is superb! Nonetheless, from my experience, I can say for sure my wife and I are fully satisfied and happy! Job well done to CenCal, the team,and Freddy and Daniel, you guys are the Real MVP! Freddy and Daniel provided excellent customer service with outstanding professionalism! Now that's how you win your customers and have them coming back! Greatly knowledgable and friendly; did not come off as rude and took their time to explain the different tints they offer and what their differences are. Recently, I have been looking around for windows tint for my wife's Toyota Corolla car.  The places (rated with high ratings) I contacted via phone were rude and came off as unprofessional/unfriendly. I then came across CenCal and I have to say, Daniel's punctual professionalism and friendly customer service via  phone was what won me over. Dropped by to check out their different tints, and the CenCal team and Freddy greeted me right away. Freddy provided exceptional customer service and took his time to explain the tints they offered, how they work, and also answered any questions I had, so thats definitely an A+ in my book! They were very accommodating and was able to squeeze in my car for that day even though they were busy booked; got it done on the same day! Highly recommend them! I will let friends and family know of your business. For sure I will definitely come back for any future windows tint installations! Thanks CenCal Window Tinting, team, and Daniel and Freddy! Keep up the excellent work!< /Text>

Daniel and James were on time, friendly, and very professional! I got the Ceramic tint on the back, front, and sun roof window to help block out the heat. I loved that they take great pride in their work and it shows! They are also reasonably priced. I absolutely LOVE my tint and plan on having them tint our truck in the near future! I’d highly recommend them and would refer to all my family and friends!
I will update my review next summer to let you all know how they guarded against our Fresno, CA heat. I’m sure they’ll do great!< /Review>

Daniel was awesome! I was shopping around for a place to do my tint job & I came across them on Instagram. I was able to get a quote from Daniel real fast, and it was reasonable for what I get with it. The tint job looks amazing & I would definitely recommend their work! Very knowledgable & professional!

We have used Cen Cal for 2 of our vehicles. Daniel did an awesome job on both of them. He was very professional and easy going. We will definitely be using him again.</Review>

These guys were amazing, affordable, fast, and professional! I got an appt really fast and I dropped my car off soon I don't have a garage and he dropped me off at home until my car was ready and dropped my car back off to me! I needed my back 2 windows to have the old bubbly tint removed and put new tint on. They were done within an hour and it came out amazing! I highly recommend these guys and will be referring them to people that need their tint done. Thanks again! You guys were awesome!<//text>

<Review>Daniel did an awesome job on my 2020 Chevy Silverado. He was professional and was willing to answer all my questions about what type of tint I should go with. The convenience of the company coming to your home was a huge benefit. Especially for anyone with kids. I didn’t have to sit in a waiting room or have to make time to pick up my vehicle after completion. I would highly recommend this company.<//Review><user_name>Customer<//user_name>< Date>

Cen Cal Mobile Tinting did an amazing job. My whole experience with them was great. From the scheduling to the job, I couldn't ask for anything more. They were on time, professional, and the tint looks perfect. If you're looking for a mobile tint service this is the one to go with. I highly recommend Cen Cal Mobile Tint!< /Text>

<review>I recently purchased a new vehicle and reached out to CenCal for tinting the front windows so that it would match the factory tint on the rear windows. Daniel quickly responded and had an opening the next morning. He gave me a very reasonable price. The very next morning I dropped off the car and also added tinting the windshield with a clear (blue) tint to reflect the heat and within a few hours the car was done. When I stopped by to pick it up they were just putting the finishing touches on and cleaned the vehicle so it was exactly as I left it. All in all, the service was top notch, Daniel was responsive, knowledgeable, and on time and delivered as promised. CenCal is exactly what a small local business should be - quality work, good service, and dedicated to the craft.

I wouldn’t hesitate to go back to CenCal for my next tint job.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>They did an amazing job! I always went with standard tint on my previous cars but after getting ceramic on my new car, I’m never getting anything other than ceramic! It’s so much more worth it and really keeps my car cool with this Fresno heat.

<text>Very professional, they came  to my home and performed a very good job on my vehicle . Very professional and also couldn’t even tell they were here  (meaning they cleaned up after themselves) I have always went to one other place for my window tint  but this experience has changed my mind and it’s a huge appreciation/convenience for them to come to my home and tint my windows .
Thanks again fellas!!< /text>< UserId.>

Won't do semi trucks because they are to lazy to cut the tint, or just don't have the skills,  so basically they rely on a machine,</review>

Easy to make an appointment with and fix any problems that may come along. I had to cancel due to work and he understood and booked me for the next weekend with conformation text hassle free! As soon I brought my car home my neighbor wanted to know where I got the work done and said only the best and gave him Daniel business card. I would highly recommend to family and friends!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80945b5b16a384cd:0xb196c0df80e46f70<//Gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1579404625074</Time>< pics>

Daniel did an amazing job on my car and it was so quick! He is very knowledgeable and friendly. It was nice being able to have him come to my home instead of having to drop my car off somewhere for hours. Very reasonable price for excellent quality. I highly recommend.< /review>

There are a lot of window tint shops in Fresno and usually you have to drop your car off at the shops for the day. NOT ANY MORE This business comes to your house and is fully self-contained They installed ceramic window tint on our Kia sport age to help us protect the kids from the sun and as a bonus we got some added privacy which is great! The quality of work is amazing we are super happy with the results and as a family we would recommend this to anyone who is on the fence about the investment!< /review>

I had a great experience with Cencal tinting. Daniel took the time to protect the interior of my vehicle as he tinted my windows. He ensured that everything looked perfect before I left. I liked that he is prideful of his work. I will continue to recommend him to all my friends,family, and my customers at Toyota of Clovis.< /Review>

I called around, these guys responded fast, they were reasonably priced, they were very knowledgeable and willing to answer all my questions. Of course the best part was they came to me at my convenience and did an amazing job. Definitely recommending to friends and family and coming back next time I need another car tinted.<//Review>

<Review>Daniel went out of his way on a Sunday night to apply my window tint. He not only did this job after hours, but gave me a ride to my home. Their customer service is top-notch. He answered the phone right away which was a good indication he wants business. Other tinting shops/mobile tinting are quick to dismiss clients.

Thank you, Daniel, and Cen Cal Tinting.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80945b5b16a384cd:0xb196c0df80e46f70< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Took my second car to Daniel & I’m so obsessed with how precise his work is! I seriously wouldn’t recommend anyone else! He even fixed my horrible tint on my last car (from previous owner of car who had someone else do the tint) & even made sure he didn’t mess up or scratch defrosters, and he didn’t!</text>

<Review>Daniel tinted my whole car (Chevy Cruze). It has now been about 4 months since the tint and it’s in perfect condition. I also got the sun strip, which I highly recommend to anyone like myself who is too short to benefit from the car sun visor! Daniel will come to you and is very prompt and friendly. I recommend everyone to cen cal tinting!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Jesus and the team did a great job on implementing our website. We came to them with an extremely tight deadline and they took on the challenge without hesitation.

They essentially took all of the work off our plate and designed a slick WordPress site. More importantly, Jesus and the team knew how to set up the backend of the site so that it was optimized for SEO, secure, and built in a way where we could easily make changes to our site.

It was also really helpful that Jesus is a marketer, so he understood that I was looking not only to have a well designed website, but have it set up technically to rank in Google and convert more website visitors. Other agencies we worked with were strong in web design but didn't understand marketing which led to suboptimal layouts and lack of focus on SEO and conversion rate optimization.

I highly recommend working with JRM Web Marketing if you want a website that's set up to drive traffic and get results.< /Review>

I have worked with many web developers in several countries over a long and successful multi-faceted career. I’m taking the time to write this review because JRW Web Marketing is, hands down, the best outfit I’ve engaged. They have helped me sort through complex issues in a prompt, efficient and responsible manner, coming up with solutions that I didn’t know even existed. My search for the best web developers stops with JRW Web Marketing. They are, in a word, terrific.  Very highly recommended.</text>

<Text>I asked JRM Web Marketing for an impossible task  - to launch a new website for my business and do it within a tight publicity deadline for my company. They not only executed on the plan, they kept me updated, worked what felt like around the clock and delivered on their promise. The phase 1 is beautiful, professional and just what I wanted. I am looking forward to phase 2 and more traffic to hit my sales goals in 2020!</Text><date>1578168586951<//date><Rating>5</Rating>< Pics>

<text>I contacted JRM Web Marketing when I had trouble finding specialized help. I was told by other designers that what I needed was "not possible," "not practical," and "too costly."  Thank goodness a trusted colleague  referred me to JRM Web Marketing.  With JRM was a "problem" became "no problem!" and the whole matter was handled quickly and efficiently. I'm sticking with them!< /text>< gmap_id>

<Review>We needed a professional website. We took time shopping around the San Jose area for a website design agency that we could partner with. We were very specific on what we needed which was a WordPress website with ongoing maintenance. JRM Web Marketing was the top website design company in San Jose on our list because they provided everything we needed and more. They are very experienced professionals that are also reliable and responsive in communication. They absolutely know their stuff and are worth every penny. From seeing their website and online work samples, to talking to the CEO, it was a no-brainer for us. We highly recommend this company to anyone that is looking for a website redesign or ongoing maintenance.</Review><gmap_id>0x808fb6eee34cfc2b:0x8c3604728299077a< /gmap_id>< date>

Working with JRM Web Marketing has been a great experience. After speaking with Jesus, the owner about designing and developing my business's website I felt at ease and less stressed. He was very communicative and responsive to all my questions and concerns. For those who have attempted to create their own website know how difficult and time consuming it can be. It's not as simple as making your website look nice and neat, there needs to be purpose to it. It's a key component to your business.

Jesus walked me through step by step during the process to ensure I was getting the website I envisioned. It's nice to know that I was in good hands with a team of experts to get the job done right.

I look forward to continue working with JRM Web Marketing for all my website needs. I would recommend Jesus and his team to anyone who's looking to get their website professionally designed and developed.<//review>

Great service from great people! It's really important to utilize a web marketing company who doesn't just have ideas for you, but listens to your business' needs and forms their plan around your business goals. I've worked with JRM several times over the years and referred them to my clients and partners. They are always as happy as I've been with JRM's promptness, ability to meet deadlines, reliability and open communication before, during and after the project and ongoing service. If you need to improve your web marketing program or your presence on the web use JRM to get it right the first time.< /Text>

< review>
I have worked with JRM Web Marketing this year and have found them to be a professional web design agency, attentive to their clients’ needs. They are on the ready to help in any situation and are customer-service driven. They pay attention to detail, and are quick to handle any issue that may come up. All website projects that we have been involved in have run seamlessly and I have enjoyed sharing ideas, and concepts. This is a purposeful company that runs on the idea that their customer always comes first.<//review>

#1 challenge with web designers is their lack of communication and responsiveness.  JRM Web Marketing is amazing on both fronts.  They take the time initially to find out what you want and then build the perfect website that is current and responsive.  Ongoing maintenance is included as well.  Great find!<//Text>

JRM Marketing has been a great resource for our website and when we require intuitive marketing expertise. They are easy to work with, understand the changing landscape of tech and explain it in fathomable terms so we can make informed decisions quickly. Even with being located in Europe, the time difference has not been a challenge; they have always been available when needed. I highly recommend their highly competent services.< /review>

My Website is finished! I love the work JRM Web marketing team did with the redesign of my website www.conceptartfactory ! They did phenomenal work. The UI was clean and UX was user friendly and responsive on all devices. Jesus McDonald owner and project manager hand picked one of his developers for my website redesign. Jesus' communication and clear direction made the whole production process smooth and seamless. He even took the time to create videos updating me on their progress as well as taking the time to educate me on my website and development, furthering my knowledge as a visual designer and art director. This is a reflection of how much JRM cares for their clients.

I also have to add that I am very grateful they have a maintenance plan making sure my website is updated and secure. I’ve worked for large companies that didn’t even have this kind of service on their website and applications.

JRM Web Marketing is amazing! Thank you!

JRM is currently redesigning my design website. I created the website on a website builder platform online a few years ago. As my business grew I needed my features which I could not do with the platform my website was on, being restricted to the tools provided on it. Due to  the current climate for business there is a greater need to rely on our websites and online services even more if we want our businesses to not just make it through this time but to continue to grow. I spoke with the JRM project manager I shared with him all the features and plugins I needed for my website redesign and he said that it was all possible which was a relief. Due to the fact that the website will be built on WordPress which has thousands of plugins that can be implemented for my website keeping the viewer there without having to be navigated to another webpage. It was great to know as my business grows my website can adapt as well.

I also addressed my concerns of what would happen once my website was created if they would be available if the website ran into issues be it running slow, hacked due to lack of security issues. Even if the website looked beautiful It would be all a waste to if the I wasn’t responsive, not working or was hacked. I was grateful to hear that I would have a maintenance plan that would address all the concerns I had. They would backup my website daily, make sure it was updated so it will be responsive and secure. Speaking of security, they have plugins in place to alert the team if there are any issues that arise…. I also like the fact the team is responsive and I can actually speak to an actual human being.

I already have the first iteration on my website which I am very pleased with…. I will post another update once my website is launched!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1594678876864, 'text': 'Alex, thank you for your review and the kind words.

It’s a honestly beyond negligent that your doors have been closed during this entire Covid pandemic. What are we as Veterans supposed to do when our own community and/or our VA can’t help us , because their scared and shut everything down. It’s no surprise we have so many homeless Veterans or on average 20 veterans who would rather take their own life, than deal with this type of negligence after we come back from war.<//Review>

Great place for veterans to go. They are very helpful. Lots of resources if you ask. It took me 17 years after I discharged from USMC to find this place and I'm glad I did.<//Text>

The folks who work for US VETS at this location are not very helpful at all. They build up your hopes that they will and can  help you and leave important information out then decide they can't help. Oh and țhey keep the fact that they can't help you to themselves until you call to find out why you have not heard from anyone.

The security guards and the information folks in the building are caring compassionate and very supportive people. Perhaps they should be the US VET representatives.< /Text>

<text>I dont know where these positive review are coming from but ive heard from other veterans on there bad experiences here. I waited 3 weeks for appointment with a VSO on the second floor and after waiting 3 weeks for specific appointment with more experience one. Why? because the last two messed it up and didnt do there job. Well after waiting an hour and told that we are short staffed the lady told me that they will be unble to see me and that I will have to make another appoint or see one of the other inexperienced vso so they mess it up again. I thought I had learned my lesson when dealing with US vets and JVS but I guess not. I will never be back good luck if you do because they dont answer the phones and you have to make the trip down there to make an appointment. So much for helping vets!!</text>< user_id>

My daughter is starting her third year of college at UCSB, she decided to stop in here because it was closer than the Riverside location that took care of here B.O.G. waiver the last two years.  The Staff here sent her away empty handed without bothering to double check their records to confirm that she (and I) had already been in the program for over two years.

<Review>The VSO at this historical place, helped me with getting my service connection. He understood perfectly my case, being experienced in all military matters that pertain to helping other Veterans, getting the benefits that they are entitled to receive. Thank You to my VSO officer fellow Veteran George Dixon. I never would have done it without you. He is the best in all he does. He is helping me now to get my upgrade to 100% service connection. I almost gave up on my claim because of the stress, triggering my PTSD making me remember the physical beatings that I went through. I didn't like reliving my tragedies, and, I have been through denials before. I said to myself, This was my last try for my claim, and, if I get denied this time, that's it!!!!; I will NEVER try again for my benefits. But, what happened was that someone told me to go to the Bob Hope Patriotic Hall and go see George Dixon. I did just that and he helped me get 40% service connected the first time out. Now we are working on my 100%  service connection for PTSD, TBI, Military Trauma, Spinal injuries, and other issues that I still suffer from my Military Service. I almost gave up, and, I am glad I didn't give up. They helped me get connected, and, they can help you too. Thanks for your Time, Help, Love, and, support. Respectfully, Gary Lee Hull Disabled Veteran and Musician.

This place for veterans? It's a joke. Just like other places supposed to be helping, has one or two good people - see Mr. Dixon and Ms. Stone, a couple (like in two) of helpful and respectful staff, and the rest - just Unpatriotic, Disrespectful mooches that are, pure and simple, ANTI-veterans.
It starts at the door, where security strips you of just about anything they feel like and recommends you "hide" it outside under a trash can!!!
It continues with short Fridays when their schedule is 0800 to 1200. Again, credit needs to be given to Mr. Dixon, who at least on one occasion asked his team on the 2nd floor to stay longer hours, until every veteran that came to their door had a chance to have their question answered.
Also, lots of good things can be said about Ms. Stone and her receptionist who seem to work around the clock, with dignity and care for every veteran.
Then there is the U.S. Vets on the 4th floor, whose representative is as snappy as they come, not helpful as they come, and does little all day besides parading herself in high heels and, yes, even harassing some of the vets. What a useless employee she is!!! When asked about a U.S. Vets event, she referred this vet to the Internet. "Google it", she said, despite the fact that she has a cubicle with a computer and phone at her disposal to HELP the veterans.
Another thing: the building has employee kitchens on every floor, but "according to the rules" not ONE of these kitchens are for veteran use.
Bottled water is available on the 6th floor, by request only. So much for preserving the dignity of the veteran!
On the 6th floor lays the "valor" program. I say lays because it doesn't seem to do anything. The program is currently closed, but I'm not surprised. Other than snutty counselors/social workers giving veterans more pain than gain, there wasn't much about it.
Now the program refers vets out to clinics that serve the general public, and are not dedicated solely to helping veterans.
The 8th floor seems to be for building maintenance people only. Maintenance that is actually so lazy that, hand in hand with security try to actively discourage any homeless veteran that comes through their doors.
Yes, after years and years of coming to the building I accidentally found out that they have showers for the use of homeless veterans, brand new showers built with absolutely no drainage so that upon use, veterans are handed a squeegee and requested that - after the shower - they clean the water that does not drain because of the faulty design. Locks are FORBIDDEN by security from being brought into the building, so there is no way of securing your belongings whle taking the shower: either you take the risk of having your stuff at the mercy of whomever is using the bathroom at the time, or you can safely accommodate only one veteran at the time, which is inefficient.
By the way, shower days are only Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 0800 to 1200. 15 or 20 minutes is all that is allowed for the shower from the moment you get in until you come out.
They also have a couple of other programs, that look more like ghosts, in that I hardly ever heard of them having any events and/ or results, which makes me wonder why they are so vaguely publicized, how come the people working these programs don't seem concerned with their lack of events or results and, oh, yes, HOW do they get their funding with such an insignificant presence?
All in all, Bob Hope Patriotic Hall is a very sad excuse for a veteran resource. With all its majestic appearance - the architecture is just gorgeous - it serves veterans very little - and is a great disappointment, despite a few good men and women that seem to fight a losing battle there in their continued efforts to help the vets. These people I give 5 stars with all my heart, but that is not enough to save the building from being mostly an extravagant continued unjustified spending for the use of the employees and NOT the veterans.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) If I remember correctly. It is a reservoir. nice environment. It was a friend who took me. Lots of historical pictures when visiting. The destination that comes to mind when you see it with its picture.

Perfect venue for dance performance. Acoustic is also very nice! Truly enjoyed last night’s Diablo Ballet presentation - Balanchine & Beyond. Easy parking too.</Review>

Well, there's the bad and the great.  First of all, you can't find the theatre bldg when you come into the compound because on the parking lot side there is no name on the theatre building, its around the corner where you can't see it unless you're just at the entry.  It needs to be moved.  I even asked some of the students and they even didn't know which building it was.

Now for the great part.  Ron Tobin was absolutely fabulous. His stand up of 'My Mother's Italian My Father's Jewish and I'm in Therapy' was so funny I just wished it would go on for a few weeks more.<//text>

I Love my Doctor! From there it goes below average fast. The phone number given for questions about billing is never answered. At my office visit, I asked the office staff for my balance so I could make a payment in full, but they informed me they didn't know what it is. Really, who does business like this? My account balance is not accessible on the office computer? So, at the end of my visit I asked for the total for the visit that day and paid it in full only to receive another bill with more charges added, but they are mystery charges as there is not explanation of the charges.  You need to get your house in order!< /text>

I was pleased with the treatment and efficiency of this office. Dr Brown listened to my complaints and offered treatment to alleviate my symptoms. There were x-rays taken and I received an injection for my knee pain. The process went smoothly but I did not feel rushed or neglected for any period of time. Definitely left feeling better.<//Text>

Dr. Iain Gallego is my primary physician and he by far has been the best doctor I have ever had. It can be difficult finding the right primary doctor, but I can say with certainty that you will be happy with him. He genuinely cares, listens to all your concerns, and is determined to help you. I mean it when I say he will tirelessly try all avenues in order to get to the root of the issue that ails you. If you are considering a new physician you can rest assure that you be very well taken care of by him and his team. As even his medical assistants are very professional, attentive, polite, and caring as well. Making for an overall great visit from start to end.</review>

<review>Very well organized and professional. Impressed with all of it. I am a medical professional and brought my mother to the appointment. I could clearly feel God's love in the entire office. I was especially impressed with the doctors assistant. Thank you for providing excellent care.

There are not enough words in the dictionary to explain how wonderful it is to be his patient.  I recommend him to anyone.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Dr Valdez has always been a great doctor.  I was very disappointed to see him leave Dignity Health which I chose to stay with at that time.  I am happy to say it was very nice to be back with Dr Valdez.  He always makes it a point to listen to my health concerns and always is very helpful with my health questions or concerns. Happy to be with Dr Valdez and Adventist Health!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
The staff sincerely care about the patients, are so polite, and make you feel very much at ease.  They radiate a genuine feeling of being happy to work there, and the physicians are among the most approachable anywhere. There is a sense that all are your partners in health care. While Adventist Health is a huge organization,  patients are dealt with personally, not impersonally, not like mere numbers.

Don't change a thing, except for one thing: Give those hard-working and dedicated people a great big raise!

<review>I have been seeing Iain Gallego for about 4 years now and I have never had a doctor like him that cared and listened. I don’t feel rushed when I see him and again I have never had that. Every year when I have to re-enroll for my insurance I make sure he is in network so I can continue seeing him. The staff have always been super courteous and nice. I’m always able to get an appointment within a decent time as well. Thanks everyone for caring, it’s refreshing!!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I am extremely happy with Dr. Ingy Ayad and her entire staff for all my health care needs. Everyone is professional and courteous, my questions and concerns are always addressed promptly. When I have had any abnormal results I have been notified immediately and been involved in the decision making process regards the next steps. Routine appointments are always confirmed via e-mail notice which is awesome. Communication is outstanding.</review>

<Text>I like Dr Valdez and his assistant.  The front office staff need some help.
I want my lab work sent to my cardiologist and all the staff offered to do was print me a copy so I could deliver it myself.   Dr Valdez intervened and had the results faxed.
Had I know how I could have emailed the results from my Patient Portal.< /Text>< Pics>

They are all wonderful, Dr. Srephen is not only a caring Dr. I sort of see him as a great friend, I can talk to him about anything and he's always so compationate, caring, and warm, he really shows empathy, all Drs. Should be like him. In a Dr. patient way I love him to pieces. I truly trust his opinion. So yes I would recommend him and all who are with the staff, in a heart beat.</review>

After the check,  the office gave me a detailed report about this visit  which is so good that I could have more clear idea about what I should do or what the doctor's diagnosis is.

The office staff,  and physicians are the best I've  ever  been treated by. I have a myriad of health issue's, and have seen literally hundreds of doctors. My Primary Care physician  is so wonderful, my daughter AND gtandchildten now see her. They are just as pleased with the EXCELLENT  care and concern she has for all her patients.. if you are looking for excellent, personalized care, you are doing yourself a great disservice if you do not check them out!<//Review>

< Review>
I have been with my doctor since 1990 and consider him my family doctor. Love my doctor, but have to be careful as to whether additional services at the same facility are covered by my insurance plan.</Review>

So satisfied with Ian Gallegos: knowledgeable, personable, wish more physician assistants and physicians had his bedside manner. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Loved the way I was treated and the follow up calls I received.  The only complaint is that I had to walk myself out to the car because it was taking soooo long for someone to come get me.<//text>

Dr Amjadi has pride in his surgical team which is reflected in his great work and positive patient outcomes.  Dr Amjadi and both of his elite hand-picked teams have earned my respect and appreciation.  Thank you again Dr Amjadi and teams, I am grateful for you.

< Review>
I couldn’t find a more caring and compassionate doctor then Dr. Seidenstricker. He takes time to answer all your questions and  he takes the time to help you overcome your concerns about your health  you may be having at that time.
The main thing that I would have to say that’s a downfall with me is the return of phone calls from the nursing staff and the scheduling of an appts. For something that week.</Review>

<review>I was referred to Dr. Amjadi because I had lower back pain and leg pain. Right when he saw my MRI an X-rays the look on his face showed deep concern. I could barely walk and was leaning to one side because I couldn't put pressure on my left leg. My case was so severe he scheduled for me to have surgery the next week. Its been 6 days since my surgery and I feel no pain. I would definitely recommend Dr. Amjadi to anyone with back pain or neck pain. Before the surgery I looked at Dr. Amjadi's reviews and there wasn't one that was bad and he had 5 stars to top off. I give him 5 stars hands down, Thank you Dr. Amjadi!<//review>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I am truly pleased with the service and the attention that is given to the customers at this store. The manager Kevin works diligently and is very knowledgeable. He answered all my questions with detail going above and beyond and made sure I was happy with everything. He was very patient and didn’t rush me at all into buying products. This store focuses on keeping customers satisfied rather than pushing them into becoming part of AT&T . If anyone needs assistance with either buying accessories or joining AT&T ask for Kevin.<//Review>< pics>

<text>The manager kevin was the sole reason I switched to verizon.  He cares more about being in a position of power over his employees than he cared to help me and my wife.  He seemed miserable and drank tons of coffee and acted like it was an inconvenience that I wanted to trade in my phone and get a new one.  He disrespects his fellow employees and the att name.<//text>< pictures>

Kind and everything but when I went to ask what is happening that I can not help and as if it were a very despicable nobody ball of thieves hopefully and this will help someone so that the same thing does not happen to them

If they do not like their work look for another that easy!

<Text>They just don't ever answer their phone. I went in person once and the food was decent, but just the lack of customer service gives it the 2 stars. It's not even like it's ever busy, one time I went by while I was calling to check. They just hang up, no customers in line.</Text></record>

Sometimes you just have a craving for a snack in between lunch and dinner.  You don't want it to be too heavy.  In times like these, a spam musubi from L and L hits the spot!  Warm rice with nice hot spray on top.  Put a little bit of sricha sauce, you have a winner.  L and L is a no frills place that makes generous portions of food from the Hawaiian islands.  Good BBQ items.  Staff is wearing masks and there is a bottle of hand sanitizer laying around.< /review>

We asked for the sauce and she said it was already in the bag, but it wasn't.  Kind of ruins the whole experience eating dry ribs.  They tie the bags up like they're shipping them to a far off land and you can't open them to check.  I will next time.  Don't knot up the bag!!<//Text><resp>None<//resp><date>1616352193913</date></record>

Awesome location! I has to place a larger order for 10 staff, and they got each one right. They were also very helpful when door dash messed up my order and they canceled it. I called this location directly and they still filled it in a timely manner. They gave us exactly the amount of sauces and utensils we needed as well. Will definitely keep coming here.</Text>

I was hungry but wasn’t craving anything in particular. Due to the pandemic, my options were limited. I decided to stop by here for take out. I got the aloha plate and loco moco. The food is what you would expect for an Hawaiian fast food joint. I prob wouldn’t order the loco moco again. The patty was a bit thin. Giving it 4 stars since service was great and the food was nice and hot.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5Bcb1v81DLb4e8ZAM3PuT7yjisFSWLUwvFdPu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9qxMCws5VH9meBWuMOYsS7ahv8MSXYDu6OA39=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I love this place and I love Hawaiian food. To me, this is a staple joint in San Mateo. Surprising to see the low rating, because it is solid eats. I give it a confident 5 for the food alone because I often crave it and want it again.<//review>

Service was good but the place is dirty which i understand because of limited staff. The meat is very fatty and somewhat salty. Rice and Macaroni salad is good though.</Text>

I always get the seafood mix plate or the BBQ mix plate. This place is good, and they serve you pretty fast. Only bad part is trying to find parking. I did order for pickup once and I couldn't find parking so the lady ran out and delivered my food right to the car and ran back in to charge my card. Now that's service! 🌴🌴🍖🍗 also on a side note the curry Katsu is pretty good</Text>

<Text>Gnats everywhere. I've been to the Mountain View L & L multiple times without ever having an issue. My wife and I went here for the first time today and there was a gnat in the macaroni. All the management needed to do was apologize and replace the food. Instead, they said that they're not responsible for bugs in the food and that the kitchen does not have any bugs in it. If I took the food and went outside that might make sense, but we were dining in the restaurant. They refused a refund or replacement. If you like poor customer service and bugs in your food, this is the restaurant for you.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

We came in at 8p and the lady cashier keeps on saying "We close at 9p." My friend told her about what she would like to order and she just looked and ignored her and left. Didn't even care to excuse herself. So rude! We came to eat and they're giving us attitude. The cook looks annoyed when we ordered and the cashier made us feel that were not welcome.  We'll NEVER come back..That's for sure!< /review>< pics>

Says under new ownership but service is beyond poor, tried to place phone order and nobody answers, walked in with no customers in the store and was tild there to busy to answer the phone. The restaurant it self was really dirty inside. Counters and floor were disgusting. The staff just seemed like they did not care at all. Would not reccomend. STAY AWAY</Review>

<Text>L&L in SoCal and NorCal are very different. For one, prices are a little higher here.

Secondly, portions are pretty small.< /Text>< Pics>

I love the Kalua pork and the kids love the chicken katsu.  The mini is just right size for us.< /Text><date>1495845114575<//date><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>107945476213341647743< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Worst service ever! I spoke to a women who was very rude.  I simply ask to order for catering and I asked her to remove my order because her attitude was terrible.  She suggested that her she was born with her voice and that if I wanted a princess voice that's not something she can provide.  If that's not bad attitude I don't know what is.  I will never order from there again, she would  not let me speak to her manager either and kept hanging up on me.  This occurred on 12/17/14 at 3:50 PM</Review>< pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Bought this for a family gathering of 8 people over Thanksgiving weekend, and it was not great. First, the service was bad -- called to ask for pricing and the lady was very pushy and rude. How much do 6 plates cost? $xx, goodbye. Wait! But how much do 5 plates cost? $xx, goodbye. I also asked about a couple more items and the response was "$xx, goodbye." This is no exaggeration, I fought through this conversation with her. When I actually picked up the food, all 5 boxes were stuffed into one plastic bag. I asked for another bag and she asked "why do you need that?" When she actually gave me a bag, the boxes WERE SMASHED! Are you really so cheap you that you must squeeze everything into one standard sized plastic bag??!! Lastly, the macaroni salad tasted stale, and the katsu chicken was old -- breaded portion was dark brown and the chicken was chewy and dry. The BBQ chicken was fine. If I could give this place negative stars, I would.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Ordered a regular bbq chicken healthy plate today and was disappointed. They only gave me one measly piece of chicken and loaded the plate with salad. I should've looked at the reviews before going there. Go to the Millbrae location instead.<//Text>< rating>

It's order-at-the-counter, then you can grab your food and drinks and sit on the big deck or go downstairs to a big grassy area right next to the river with some picnic tables, could bring your own blankets or seats too I would think. Prices are pretty reasonable.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

Relaxed, laid-back tasting experience where the bartender pours you a massive flight and you get to kick back on the patio and soak up those chill views of the Russian River. They have a mini-enclosed dog area, so it's dog friendly too!< /review>

So grateful 🙏 💓 and thankful for the wonderful people at Stumptown Brewery. Not only do you get a beautiful view of the Russian River, but a staff that has top notch customer service who will treat you like family. Thank you to Dustin, Eric, Deanna and staff for  the hospitality and adding a new customer to your fine place. We don't have places like this in So Cal which is why I love it up here. I was so happy and impressed that I even bought a shirt to show my appreciation. Thanks again!</text>

If you are looking for a fun little spot to grab a beer with a buddy this is the place for you. The patio area was really nice over looking the river. Due to COVID we had to order our food at the door (the food was way too pricey for what you got) and then pick it up at a different window. We also had to clean out dishes and table before we left. My husband and I got the pulled pork sandwich and the polish dog to share together and both were not good at all. On the menu it said that pork was smoked for 12 hours, I don't know what happened in those 12 hours but it had no flavor and was dry (even with coleslaw on it). Thank God the beer was good and the staff was friendly.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML5qzJIM1-zkeD3Y7HTDSv1k8WLBvJpIUm0rIj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBmoUYH9xawSwAfM6hroNYAkNuA5ONFyAfpPJd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><time>1599796521461< /time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Thanks for being here...this place is AWESOME! Tucked away in the heart of the Russian River Valley they don't take themselves to seriously but brew some serious beers.

Even if beer isn't your thing the scenery alone (and BBQ next door is AWESOME!)< /Review>< pictures>

The inside is dark and reminds me of an English pub, but the outside has a great covered eating/drinking area with air hocky tables.  There is a fabulous patio with views of the Russian River.  On Monday nights a special caterer comes in and provides a wonderful barbeque, and soul food dinner.  Ribs, collar greens, mac n cheese, sausage.  Delicious!  On other nights Wood fired pizza is available.  Really good micro brews.  if you are into paddle sports. you can paddle down the RR and stop beach your craft on the brewery's shore and come in for a drink or food.< /text>< pics>

Management is doing a great job of complying with Public Health Orders. We had fun with plenty physical distance thanks to the vast outside area overlooking the river, WHILE also trusting we were in a business that cares about preventing the spread. Kudos!</Review>

Killer vibrations, outside seating on the river! Great food, if you  like sports and burgers and brews, well then don't  hesitate! After your done eating, next door is the Dispensary with KUSH medicine, grab a phatty and  take a stroll on the river! You just might see the Otters playing in the water! Big Up!!!!</review>

Great food, beer, and view. What more do you need? It is easier to park here if you arrive by kayak since parking on the street is so limited.</Text>

<Review>Usually pretty quiet and without a big crowd. They have a great patio and an awesome beer selection. Great place to sit out on the patio or at the bar and meet the people around you. It has a really awesome atmosphere over the summer with the popularity of the river. Definitely one of my favorite places when I'm up near the Russian River area!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1fgyinE_tKi7bQ9YINnkE6LDPrx-LA8umTXzt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Absolutely stunning setting. This had the potential to be a great experience but it was spoiled by the insolent Australian member of staff.

On arrival, we walked through the pub to reach the beer garden, with our dog (a service animal). With no greeting or any respect he marched up and shouted at us for bringing an animal into a bar and told us we should've gone through the side entrance. We stopped in our tracks, speechless. He then ordered us to continue through because we've already come this far.

The beer garden has such a stunning view over the river that we decided to ignore this man. My wife joined the queue for the bar where there's a sign up that says couples have to use the stools and not take up space at the tables, so I chose a pair of stools overlooking the river.

When my wife came back with the drinks she said she'd rather sit in the shade, if possible. Despite there being plenty of shaded seating around the large (mostly empty) tables, I didn't want to get shouted at again so decided to shift the pair of stools a few feet to the right, so they're in the shade. The Ozzy t**t must've been watching our every move because before I even lifted the first stool he aggressively shouted, "DON'T MOVE THE FURNITURE!". Seriously?

I calmly approached him and asked what the solution should be, since we want to sit in the shade but the sign says we have to sit on stools. He unapologetically directed us to sit at the tables and ignore the sign. Wait, so now it's ok to ignore signs?

By this point we just wanted to drink our drinks and get the hell out of there before I lost my temper with this a-hole. Having read some of the other one-star reviews I can see that other people had a similar experience with him.

We would definitely go back, if he wasn't working there.</review>

Really poor customer service. My friends and I came here to buy beer and food while following all Covid guidelines. We asked someone working here for help because their signs were confusing. Instead of being helpful, he asked in a very sassy way, “Are you even paying attention?” He told us to by food first before drinks, which is fine, so we decided to find a place to sit down first then one of us was going to go order. Then he came over to us not even five minutes later and accused us of not being patrons, yelling at us. I told him yes, we are trying to figure it out and told him he was rude. He accused me of being sensitive and not wanting to follow their rules—but we were! We were wearing masks and we were getting ready to order food, but he continued to yell at us. Idk what his problem was—we came here to patron this business, and be safe—and instead all we got was attitude.< /text>

Didn't even try the food the two bartenders were so terrible at their job it was pathetic, we got our drinks and then were told we have to pay immediately and cash only, which was the first red flag then told to go to another area to order food and pay for it with them. Our drinks were fine it was just such a lack of personality with the service it was very akward. I have never even left a review before, but just wanted to warn people about my experience have been to hundreds of bars and this was one of my worst experiences ever< /text>

<Text>The view is spectacular. You can walk down to the river from their back patio.  Alcoholic beverages are not allowed along the river, so finish them before you decide to visit the river.

You can get food from the pop up restaurants that serve on the back patio. Call Stumptown to see who is cooking the night you want to visit.

This place has great beer choices.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

For people on vacation the cash only part is an inconvenience. Staff was borderline rude. Nice patio overlooking the river. Beer is just OK.....< /Review>

This place is a gem, seriously, totally down to earth crowd, nothing pretentious about this place, good food and good cold beer, nice staff with good attitudes that kept the atmosphere light and refreshing what more can you ask for? Our entire group enjoyed themselves</Review>

< Review>
The male bartender working yesterday afternoon was extremely rude - I was really surprised at how he took the simple process of ordering a beer and turned it into an upsetting experience.

Of all the bars I've been to, I struggle to think of a place with staff even remotely as rude. I guess I should have checked Yelp first - I'm not the first one to have such an experience.</Review>

Horrible place! Cash only, staff is rude, and they are not dog friendly. Great place for an IRS/Medical lawyer to pay a visit to. Perfect place for a Hells Angel's and Mogols get together. So if your into that sort of thing, I'm not, I strongly recommend taking your money down the road to the Russian river pub.</Text>

Fun, low key place. Although it’s a brewery they have a full bar too. The big selling point is the large outside area leading down to the river. We visited in off season and it was totally empty apart from a few friendly locals, but I imagine this place is an amazing hang out in the summer.</Text>

< Review>
Sad to say off season is not such a winning time to visit. The bartender was too busy doing shots with the 4 men at the end of the bar to get me a beer. Really sad cause the place seems like a great hang out then men drank cocktails and I suspect they don’t like
The beer. I was sadly disappointed since I have a decent beer background. I’m sure with another persons working the experience could drastically improve but I didn’t like the product enough to finish: Too bad!< /Review>

< Review>
This is a place made to just hang out and chill. The house beers are great. The garlic fries are really garlicky. The patio has an air hockey table, and a pool table. The stairs down to the beach on the Russian River are for the customers. There is no waitstaff, per se, you go to the bar to order and pay for drinks, then you go to the grill and order food and pay there. They give you a buzzer to let you know when it's ready to pick up. Note: this is a cash-only operation! No credit cards. But it is a place where people come to just hang and relax.<//Review>

Great deck and good food right on the river. A nice mix of locals and (in the summer) braver tourists. In-house small batch beers are good, as are the sandwiches and fries. Small dog run for the pooch. Also, gotta love the air hockey.<//text>

<text>Beware as this establishment only accepts cash up front.

Ordered the Smoked Brisket Sandwich - meat was overcooked, underwhelming and dry. I asked if could exchange for something else and was told not possible and neither was a refund. Not impressed.

The location is nice; I just wish the customer experience was better as I wanted to love this place.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>108922561819975223402</userid><Time>1504735267408< /Time>< name>

Love to outdoor seating area. The service could be a little better and you aren't going to get super fancy food here but that's what you should expect at a local brewpub. Go here for the beer and good times.< /text>

First (& 2nd impressions) of a place are hard to get past when they aren't good but I will try to give Stumptown another chance.

It would be nice to drink the beer here but the last two times I've attemted to do so the bartender has not greeted me, ignored me to the point where I had to be the one to get her attention, and seemigly just plain unenthusiastic about the beers Stumptown serves.  When I told her that it was my first time she pointed to the chalkboard as if the names of their beers mean anything to me and when she came back around to take my order I told her I don't know what to order. There aren't many micro brews I don't like but there were a couple IPAs on tap so I told her I like IPAs in hopes she would give me more information and I could make the best choice. She said the Haze IPA is good (no tasting notes, no what differentiates it from the other IPAs, no sample, etc...just "good") but since she made an actual suggestion & I hope to eventually taste all the beers here anyways that is what I went for.  Ultimately I didn't end up ordering because it was cash only and I didn't have enough for food+beer+tip & on top of those costs paying an ATM fee wasn't worth it in return for the cruddy service I was receiving.  I couldn't figure out maybe if I just visited when this bartender is having a bad day, if it's just me she treats that way (this was the 2nd time I went in and she wasn't very welcoming then either), or if she doesn't like/ isn't knowledgeable enough about the beer she is serving which is why she can't talk about it, or if perhaps she is  just really bad at customer service.

Whatever the case I plan to come back in the future,  with cash ofcourse, but when this gal bartender isn't the one serving me. Hard to go to a place that doesn't seem all in on their product or accustomed to bare minimum welcoming a person who is wanting to be there. So hopefully I will have better experience next time and I I can make this a regular spot.< /Review>

<Review>The food was good but honestly their beer selection was mostly an IPA festival and service was a little shady. It was an okay find but I'll be going somewhere else next time. Also cash only which was a bit of a problem for our group. ATM was provided but not without a hefty fee.< /Review>< user_name>

Great shady deck overlooking the river, perfect for spending a few hours playing games or just relaxing. Good selection of beer and a 4-7pm happy hour.<//Text>

Great place with beautiful view of the Russian River.  Very relaxing when the weather is warm out to enjoy few beers and food. Great place spacious love the bench style seating area. You have to grab your bucket filled with condiments and the table number,  you also have to order up front and pay there, then they will bring the food out to you. CASH ONLY,  but convienantly there is an atm machine inside soon as you walk in to your right. Good customer service very friendly</review>

<Name>Liam Pegg< /Name><Date>1528491774184< /Date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>Walked into this place thinking, wow what a cool place to get a beer and get something to food. After that initial thought, it went all downhill. When we sat down to order food it took five minutes to flag down a waitress. Upon requesting a drink from her she said, "oh you have to order drinks at the bar". So I went to the bar and then waited 10 minutes while the bartender took that time to make three simple Moscow mules. After finally thinking it was my turn, the bartender brushed me off to attend to what it looked like a local. Then finally the bartender attended to me and upon request for a drink, the bartender told me the waitress had to check my ID. Why couldn't the bartender or waitress told me that in the first place? The service was downright awful and unprofessional. I would not recommend this place and message to the owners  or managers learn to run a better business especially when it's a customer facing business.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

They have a dog area on the back patio, but it also has their propane tank and some really old porta-potties. It's not a great solution.< /review>< Pics>

Mediocre food, decent drinks and a solid outdoor pool table. It's essentially a dive bar with a bit of a kick.<//Text>

The kitchen is cash only and closes at 4p, right when you come off the river hungry and thirsty.  The employees had an attitude when we came in at 3:45 and they exclaimed it would be "a dick move to order food so close to closing".  If the kitchen is open till 4, they should serve food till 4.  This was a reluctant second chance after the first time I went here two years ago with a large group of friends.  We all ordered food and a beer and as I watched all my other friends get their food and eat, my order never came.  When I asked about it, I got some of that famous attitude that the kitchen was closed, and I had to threaten calling the cops in order to get my money back.  Avoid this place.</Text>< Response>

Stumptown Brewery is as local as it gets for local beer. And not many breweries have a separate yard where your dog can hangout while you have a beverage... Or a place to pull up from the river and eat lunch and keep paddling - or dinner when you're done for the day - a cold beer is awfully good sounding when you are headed down the river. Stumptown has all of the above.

The food is bar food and cash only. Burgers, fries, onion rings, and such.

The back deck is extensive and awesome for hanging out and looking at the river... And the lower lawn is home to the annual Beer Revival and BBQ cook off.<//Review>

I can't vouch for the quality of food here as I have never been able to actually try it. The kitchen is cash only and closes at 4 -which is bad enough but even if you come in at three thirty they will not serve you because they are already shutting down.<//Text>

From candy for the kids to clothes for a casual day out Tokyo central has everything I need. I shop a this store weekly. They always have deals on a lot of stuff. My favorite is the 24 pack of Sapporo that goes for $16. I highly recommend this store. 👍</Review><Time>1621913854674<//Time>< Rate>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>As far as Japanese grocery stores go, we in the Los Angeles area are pretty fortunate. We have Nijiya, Mitsuwa, and others though few are as big as this branch of Tokyo Central. You can find not only the standard fare of snacks, groceries, and Japanese food staples but there are also restaurants as well as a whole floor of home goods, tshirts and so on. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>The grocery had a lot of Japanese items to choose from, it was really hard to pick & choose which ones to buy. It had a second floor that looks like a department store that sells dry goods like kitchen ware, clothes, appliance and Japanese trinkets. They do have Anime figurines, clothing & accessories too. There were a good variety of restaurants in the food court and the food was great.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmrlgEQcO5maMhzvArYfcAWdUK7oajDK5706wi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj9DmiYJgWk7QddwT83D92HyF5uTpi8ABtJPoS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

The best experience ever among all the Tokyo central. I think this is the largest store here in Los Angeles areas. Foods are diverse and fresh, a lot of sashimi choices. The food court is still close due to COVID and it is slightly crowded during the weekend. But again, it is a great store and highly recommended. Even if you don't want to buy anything, walking around here is time well spend< /Review>

Best Japanese food and kitchen supermarket I’ve been to outside of Japan.  They even have a Hawaiian products aisle.
Good produce selection, terrific sushi and seafood, and wonderful, noodles, sauces, and spices from Japan.  Best yet, many of the labels on the shelves explain and differentiate the products—very helpful when selecting a Shoyu sauce, soba noodle, or seaweed package.
Also, don’t forget to check upstairs for clothing, slippers, toys, suitcases, and other products.</text>

<Text>The best Japanese supermarket in Los Angeles. It's well stocked. I found everything I needed. Sea asparagus, fresh octopus, fish meatballs, etc. They have a big parking lot. It's crazy that they are associated with Don Quixote, a cheap department type store, which I went to in Tokyo.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I LOVE this store. They try their best to label everything in English to make it more accessible to folks.

If youre going to buy the plates make sure you show up before 7. At 7 pm they go on sale for 20% off but by then there's little to nothing left. People come in a little before 7 and stack their carts. Come earlier and pay full price if you really want to be able to have options.<//review>

Lots of variety! Very fun! This particular location is huge too. Lots of fresh food compared to other locations/Japanese grocers. Felt like we were back in Japan at Don Quixote. Fairly reasonable prices.< /Review>

Very clean inside.  Due to Covid-19 protocol, limited people were allowed inside the market.  But the line moves very fast.  They have some good fresh vegetables, fruits and meat section.  They have this Passion Orange Guava (POG) in 1 quart carton at the refrigerator section.  They also have one of the best deal in bento boxes meal.  A box costs between 5.99 to 6.99.  Fresh sushi, maki rolls, all at a good price.</Text>

<Review>The best Japanese supermarket. Not only is Tokyo Central designed culturally appreciate, but also you can find various Japanese food, snacks, and cultural heritage merchandise.

Tokyo Central Market is huge, clean, and well organized. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic era, the upper stores are closed.

When you are inclined to have Japanese food, enjoy a quick look at what Japanese culture looks like, come visit Tokyo Central Market.

You won’t be disappointed.</Review>< rating>

Very good quality produce and meat, such a large selection of japanese liquor and snacks, and just necessities if you like japanese cuisine.

<Text>To Tokyo Central Meat Dept.:  I used to love your thinly sliced beef to make sukiyaki or bulgogi.  But now
the beef is sliced too thin that it just crumbles.  Please have your butcher slice it a little thicker so you can
hold  it up without it crumbling to pieces.  Thank you.< /Text>< Pics>

OMG! This was so much fun! It's a huge Japanese grocery store with just about everything you can imagine.  I wondered around in absolute amazement.  It's so interesting and a great cultural experience.  The staff was really helpful, even suggesting I try a neighboring store when they didn't have what I was looking for.  Be brave,  buy something you have never tried before!</Review>

<text>I really like this place, it has a department store vibe upstairs and a grocery store down stairs. It's like a don quijote in japan stacked on a mitsuwa. I will very much be back, and might try to make it a monthly staple.< /text>< username>

I'm sure it's the largest selection of Japanese groceries in the Los Angeles area. They have items which I never could find in tokyo or chiba. This trip I picked up cookies from Hokkaido and Okinawa. If you're not able to go on vacation to Japan for whatever reason this is a good alternative</Review>

You can get lost in the sundry area looking at all of the cool home wares, makeup, and cleaning products.

We did go looking for luau leaf to make laulau but no one has it. It was still worth going to look here. I remember when it was Marukai. Still has that vibe!</review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<Response>None< /Response><text>The best prices in town for Japanese and Hawaii food items. It looks like the Don Quixote group is taking over, but I don't think that will impact the great prices. They also bring in unique food items and Japan regional fares. Right now it's strawberry season so they have cool but super expensive Japanese strawberries. The food court is also outstanding - the karaage chicken at Tenkatori is pretty awesome.
The down sides are minor stuff. I realize that they need to pack in product but I wish it was easier to maneuver the aisles. Many barely fit two carts going in opposing directions. Also the parking spaces tend to be on the tight side, and they don't have adequate very return stations.</text>< Date>

<Review>I had so much fun here! My husband and I got katsu from the food court, which was amazing. I haven't had katsu this good since I was in Japan. Then I had some fun browsing the retail items upstairs, ended up buying a few gifts for my friends who like kawaii things. The household items look pretty solid too, memory foam pillows, top of the line rice cookers, etc. I was kind of surprised they didn't have a bigger variety of Asian veggies (like 99 ranch, H-Mart). But they do have those Japanese strawberries (a real delicacy).</Review>< date>

As soon as I walked in, it smelled great!!! There is a takoyaki stand at the entrance. The layout and decor of the store is just like your in Japan. It’s worth the 40 minute drive from my place.<//review>

Amazing! So many Japan products and foods!! There are two floors, first floor is mainly food and groceries. Honestly we didn't get to go to the second floor cause of how long we took looking and getting everything on the first floor. Second floor looks like it has more clothing and household appliances.</review>

A great alternative to Mitsuwa marketplace if you're looking for fresh produce and Japanese ingredients.

Sometimes I want to be creative and try making takoyaki or o-nigiri, I get everything I need here.

Gonna go on a long hike? They've got tons of prepped meals that can be taken togo. They have a great selection here and it's worth the visit.<//Text>

Crazy crowded, line literally out the door at 12:59pm on a Friday, but I've been meaning to come here for months so I was SUPER EXCITED. After not having breakfast, I was famished. I browsed some google reviews before I arrived so I knew exactly what I wanted.</Text>

Of all the Tokyo Central stores in South Bay this is by far the best one, most selection and good prices, a huge selection of authentic Hawaiian foods. Fresh, dry goods and frozen. Very busy with high turnover so everything is fresh<//Review>

Great store! Tons of Japanese food and imported items of course. You'll also find well stocked produce and high quality meat and fish. It's always festidiously fresh, clean and organized. Sushi grade fish and Kobi style beef too. Upstairs you'll find Japanese clothing, furniture, toys and antiques. Up front there's baked goods, sushi and hot food to go.<//Review>

A great place to look for delicious drinks from the land of the rising sun. Aisles and aisles of snacks for you to choose from and a long wall of drinks. They also have a second floor with goods from Japan as well. It's definitely worth walking in and looking at all the goods they have to offer. Also, they have restaurants inside by the entrance too.<//text>

I love Tokyo Central! There is literally nothing that I can't find. It is a two-story haven of Asian merchandise and food with excellent quality and service.If you're on the first floor you can find items like massagers, face and beauty supplies, food supplies, kitchen supplies, school supplies, and decoration materials. If you go to the second floor you can find everything from Japanese doll robes and clothes to decorations and house decor. all the items are recently priced and the staff is willing to negotiate. It's a wonderful location and I would be surprised if they didn't have what you were looking for.</text>

I love this place, but I wish they took covid more seriously at this location. For some reason management doesn't seem to care about the health of there customers at this specific location. Baskets aren't wiped down, the number of people in the store isn't monitored and there are plenty of customers allowed to walk around maskless.

We try not to go to this location, if possible, because other Tokyo Centrals in L. A. Do a great job so we drive 30 minutes longer to be safer.

They would normally get 5 stars but Management's disregard of safety is just too big a deal for me and my family.< /review>

It's been almost two years since I've been here but it always been a pleasure to shop over here for niche stuff or groceries.< /review>

<review>First time going, I went on a Saturday around noon and there were a lot of people, but I was still able to shop somewhat leisurely.  Good variety of grocery and household items-even had Hawaiian products! Will go back for wooden and stone dining ware AND the takoyaki!!!< /review>< Name>

Fantastic Japanese market! They have a lot of great products and even a lot of stuff from Hawaii, which is the primary reason I'm usually there. They also have a lot of really good prepared foods if you need to grab a quick lunch.. The parking lot tends to be a bit chaotic though.</text>

<Text>For a moment I thought I was inside Japan 🇯🇵 browsing Don Quiote / Tokyo. They really renovated this place and now it feels so Japanese you wonder 💭 if you are actually there and had memory loss about the airplane flight ✈️ and hotel. This grocery is nearly an exact replica, or slice of life, within Tokyo. I lived there for several years and the items this grocery carries along with its logistics is accurate to a T. Whoever managed this place, I could tell, is very educated and very, VERY competent. You could even come here as a “Japan travel destination” during this covid-19 madness we Los Angelinos are all going through. Just come here, this might as well be Japan.<//Text>< user>

<review>My wife, who is Japanese, and I started to go to TCM Redondo Beach Blvd and Artesia Blvd at the beginning of the pandemic. Now we rarely go to the Ralph's in our neighborhood. The meat selection at TCM is 1000 times better than Ralph's for cooking Japanese food because it is sliced properly. Moreover, the fruits and vegetables are the freshest and cheapest. The Mammoth Bakery inside the TCM on RB Blvd is our favorite place to buy sliced bread, perfect for breakfast toast. We can get Crystal Geyser Water for only 79 cents a gallon! We can also get very Japanese vegetable, fruit, and herb we need there. The Artesia Blvd one has great restaurants and a bakery inside. They also have the best selection of meat and bento, IMO. I loved their karaage chicken deli, but they closed it. Their 2nd floor has character goods, cooking appliances, and clothes. My wife occasionally gets stuff up there. I love their various "fairs." We got a lot of stuff during their KAGOSHIMA Fair. It is so cool to be able to get the real taste of Japan here in So Cal.</review>< Pics>

I love Tokyo Central market. Lying outside food very fast. Their deli Stand is fantastic! Just about anything I want they tend to have it when it comes to Asian cuisine. Even though it was a very long to check out it went very quick. It even had tapes stars to let you know that you were six feet away from each other. I'll definitely go again!<//text>

There are a bunch of drinks to choose from and foods. Really do recomend to come by once. There is even a second floor that has many utilities like blankets, pajamas, and some anime figurines. There is also a beauty section with shampoos, lotions, masks, makeup, etc.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Incredibly clean! Regarding quality and selection there's no stores in the area that can beat Tokyo Central. I'm incredibly impressed at how nice the staff is and knowledgeable!  All the employees helped me through my first visit to this extraordinary store without fail.  I felt as though I'd been transported to the Orient.
I will be back!<//Text>

I like this Tokyo Central the best out of the locations I've been to.  They have a food court and an upstairs homegoods area.  However, this store is very popular, and that means the lines are always huge.  The lines to get in, and the check out line every time I've gone has wrapped around the store.  It also closes earlier than the other stores.< /review>

<review>This place has always been my favorite place to shop for Japanese products starting way back when it was still Marukai. When I am about to make some Shabu Shabu, I head over and buy everything I need. Now with their updated food court, it's the perfect place to shop and then pick up some Takoyaki, Karaage or a bowl of Ramen!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

They are sold in a pack of either 8 for $8 or 16 for $14, roughly $1 each. They come with a variety of sauces, mayo, bonito flakes and green onions. So delicious!

Good Place for shopping. But you have to wait in line when you try to go inside sometimes it is not crowded when you try to go inside but when you try to leave the shopping you have to wait in line when you try to finish shopping. But it is a good place for Japanese Shopping.<//Review>

<Text>Had a great time picking up pre prepared snacks that aren't available 200 miles away in the Sierras where we live. We had Shoyu Ramen(should have bought Karaage chicken with it),a plate of cooked salmon, rice & "deli" selection of veggies. Also tuna, salmon & inari sushi. All was TAKE OUT ONLY! We were in our truck. There was a microwave available to use,self check, and extra soy sauce, chopsticks etc. BUSY at lunchtime then parking lot emptied out</Text>< pics>

Absolutely love this place! Great selection of just about everything you need to fill up the fridge, cook a meal, it simply snack on items direct from Japan including items you won't find at the American grocers. The fresh food market here is also underrated for sushi and chicken. Enjoy<//text>

< Review>
I've shopped here for decades.  I still love it but now that it's Tokyo Central it's a little different...bit still probably the biggest variety you will find.  In addition to the great amount of food items this one carries Antiques, Kimono, Obi's, clothing and various household goods, appliances, beauty care, Jewelry, children's clothing and toys.  This is definitely one of my favorite markets.<//Review>

<Review>Always a good time shopping and eating. Lines moved fairly quickly on New Years eve. The Tako line took a long while, 30 mins.<//Review>< Pics>

Large and has mostly everything you need. But be warned if you decide to go here. They get really long lines. Rush hour getting in will take 30 mins and another 30 mins of waiting in line to get to the registers. You're better off going to another smaller Tokyo central if you're running low on time.</Text>

<review>The BEST in LA!
Seriously Huge and Packed with just about Everything you could want from a Japanese supermarket and goods store. Makeup, detergent, furniture, stationary, gifts, home goods, electronic dictionaries, air conditioners, cookware, kitchen goods, stuffed animals, phone accessories, car scents, etc etc etc. Just Huge and the biggest, most well-stocked shop period among all of the Tokyo Central, Nijiya, Mitsuwa, and other Japanese supermarket centers in Los Angeles.
A handful of restaurants from takoyaki to karage for takeout.
Latest corona remodel gets rid of the antique furniture $$$, closed the dining (can still take out), adds a big stationary section with more pens and pencils than Kinokuniya, even more housewares, beauty supplies, tons of boxed take out meals, etc.
And prices are among the lowest at Japanese markets in L.A.
Seriously, the ONLY Japanese supermarket you need to shop at - a mini Bic Camera or Yodabashi!!< /review><Time>1605836603075<//Time>< Resp>

< Review>
$2.87 for a bag of ORGANiC ginger; as of february 2019.

This market caters to customers that have high standards for quality produce. The mandarin fruits are consistently of high quality. Its not the cheapest market to shop for produce but there are always deals for some of the items. You can save yourself some serious dollars if you keep checking what is on sale and when.

Ping me for any additional questions. I am happy to help.

< Review>
Ahhhh my most favorite Tokyo Central in all the land. Rows and rows of Japanese goods, groceries, and hard to find items you'd only get in Japan. Produce was fresh as usual. The home goods store has great everyday supplies - got a (Made in Japan) donabe on sale. The food court has a great takoyaki vendor. I only wish this Tokyo Central had a hot food bar like the one in Costa Mesa!< /Review>

<Text>Love this market ! Lots of Hawaii based items that you cannot find in other stores as well as basic Japanese staples. Freshly made sushi at reasonable prices as well as a sit down food court is always a nice option before or after your shopping.<//Text>< rate>

Definitely better than Nijiya Market and Mitsuwa when it comes down to Japanese products. The store is huge and filled with so many good products with good prices. Sashimi is always fresh here and there are a lot of delicious bentos for you to choose. I love fried wontons and this store has pre-made wonton filling. I just grab the wonton wrappers and this pre-made filling, fry them at home....easy and delicious!!!< /Text>

This place featurea some hidden jewel of Asian theme items especially TAMIYA Mini 4WD Cars along with other Asian character products:toys, model kits,  dolls, etc. You need to visit 2nd Floor for all these.(It used to be on the 1st floor.)
Hope it helps to save $ compare to Amazon/eBay international sellers.<//Text>

<review>Amazing Japanese market. More like a Mega Market. There are some things that are even way less expensive than you'd pay at other markets. The prepared food also is not that expensive and it looks delicious. You wont be disappointed.<//review>< Pics>

My go to place for Japanese or Hawaiian food cravings... mochi, macha tea, sashimi and seaweed salad. Produce such as Japanese eggplant, okra, bitter melon and satsuma oranges are items that I usually can't find at other chain supermarkets.<//review>

Sushi/sashimi fish department has a great selection, and it's where I discovered the sashimi version of "ends and pieces: price reduced". Quite a lot of options for a fancy meat connoisseur, too.

They're worth visiting just to see all the kitsch/kawaii upstairs. I'm not much of a collector, but I've heard from others that the prices are competitive and the finds good.<//Text>< GmapID>

This used to be marukai but I guess they got bought out by Tokyo central. It's still pretty much the same though except the dining area got upgraded especially the outdoor part. This market has a big Japanese cosmetics, lifestyle, home goods area which I love! I think if I ranked the Japanese market this would be on top closely after nijiya. Mitsuwa is prettier but it doesn't have as many items. Also this market has the best chicken karaage in their food court. Always super crowded ( which is bad during this pandemic) but theres a reason why so many people go here.< /text>

This is a very well stocked store with reasonable prices. It is now my go-to place for Japanese ingredients, treats, and kitchen supplies. They also have a good selection of Gundam models upstairs along with cat models, t shirts, and other odds and ends. I've been to a few Japanese stores in the area but this is my favorite.< /Text>

The store has everything and I couldn't wait to get there to get a new bowl. However, the line to check out was wrapped all the way to the back of the store it looked like there were 40 to 50 people in line. We put our purchases back and left.</text>

This Japanese Market has a wide variety of items, thank goodness they also have a translation in English, hahaha otherwise I would have been lost. They have the second floor also which I haven't yet visited but I'm very curious. The prices are very comparative and reasonable. The only complained I guess I would have is that there were only two Checkers open and they were like 7 to 10 of us in both lines. There is a lot of parking available.< /Text>

Our Family went to 1740 Artesia Blvd., Gardena, CA 90248 where it had a surprisingly huge choice of Japanese and Hawaiian Foods. We toured the above home goods store of many Japanese products. We will go back again. You can get fresh Sushi and produce at bargain prices. We liked the Bakery with its fine baked goods and Bread also.< /Text>

Impressive selection. Nice area. Tons of merchandise. They sell food, seafood, and clothing. There are two floors but upstairs closes earlier than downstairs.

We were visiting from out of town but if we weren’t, we would certainly come here often.<//review>

This is a neat place to shop if you’ve never been here. It has a really neat variety of items and food that you don’t see in normal stores. Everything comes from Japan and most of it is pretty awesome! The only thing I didn’t like is that they close the upstairs portion of the store an couple hours before the rest of the store. I wish that they’d put that in their info. The staff is pretty helpful and nice though! And I really love a lot their products!< /text>

Great selection I wish I had a tour guide in there! I literally hadn't seen 60% of the stuff they have in there. The fish selection is crazy and they have awesome meat as well. You can buy top end blue fin tuna for sushi and sashimi and high end A5 Japanese waygu beef too!<//Text>

Fresh fare and a decent selection of Asian oriented cuisine and condiments. The food items offered are an interesting option for a quick snack or meal.</review>

<text>Love this place. It's not as spacious and abundant as it was before new ownership, but still pretty good. Prices went up a bit but they still have fantastic bargains on fresh produce, accessories, kitchenware and more.  On busy days/times checkout lines can get pretty long, so try going in the morning on a weekday.< /text>< gmapID>

A very complete supermarket full of variety of Japanese food, drinks, comestics, electronics and souvenirs. You can find as much variety as any supermarket in Japan. They also have a wide variety of bento boxes, sushi, onigiri and fresh bakery with reasonable price.<//review>

<Review>Such a great spot. Stellar variety, whether you're looking for food, tea, alcohol, soaps... you name it. They also did some renovations last year to make it even more roomy on the inside and it's great. Staff is always helpful. Cafeteria is also pretty solid.</Review><user_name>Kim Gray< /user_name>< Time>

<Review>TCM. Daisuki! If you like japanese grocery stores you must go to this one. If you have relatives here from Japan, then they might need things from here. It's great for all folks. Get some lunch there. Shop for groceries or a shrine. Great tableware...they have lots. Just go there!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Love this japanese market, it has everything you need if you are in need of Japanese food and food. Has basic everyday household Japanese appliances, rice cooker, humidifier, hot water maker, dishes, cups, and a bunch of other cute useful Japanese things you want but you don't need. Awesome food selection, lots of reasonably priced fresh vegetables and fruit. Has organics and imports from Japan. Fresh fish from Japan and local, at reasonable prices. The meat selection is amazing the best meat you could probably get anywhere. The snacks and all Japanese ingredients you need they will have it at a good price.

They also have a food court area if you come during the busy hours of the day. The pork buns are amazing. Sometimes it gets busy so pick wisely what time if the day you decided to go. The structure is difficult to get in on Artesia. I use to pass it a few times before i was able to identify it. It's surrounded by a green fence all around.<//text>

Nice selection of rice cakes today, for New Year's. Use the self checkout lanes for faster checkout.<//text>< Pictures>

It was our 1st visit: it has an over abundance of merchandise from plush toys, seafood, small appliances, clothes, furniture, everyday food, jewelry repair, & small food court. It's great! The staff is polite and friendly. I did give it on 4 stars, there are some items reasonably priced, but most are expensive for this fixed income gal. Planning a visit: bring plenty of spending money, extra time, & walking shoes! It's a pleasant visit.<//Review>

It's sorta like this other Tokyo Central I've visited, but this place is enormous... A second floor?!
Seriously, it's large enough for one to play a good game of tag, if they wanted... And well, it's quite nice to get a taste of another country's culture, but man, is it pricey as always!
Just make sure you have money on you before you enter! It's well worth visiting.< /Review>

I just love Marukai (forever will i call it that!) Love exploring and finding new things. Fresh veggies, fruits, love their snacks, love the whole grocery part. Also prepared food selection is great. Meat dept is small but has good quality meat. The food court is slowly coming back. The Tokyo croissant place is awesome! If you love the Japanese culture, then come to this place. You'll have fun exploring everything. This Marukai is one of the largest so try to get to this one. Also don't forget the upstairs! Furniture, clothes and more!< /text>

<Review>Marukai is now Tokyo Marketplace.  The store is being remodeled and all of the food stalls are closed. The layout of the store has changed and it is more open than before.  There are signs describing what is in the aisle.  Once the remodeling is done I hope the food court will be back in operation.</Review>< username>

This was my first trip to Marukai in quite a few months and I found it quite changed from my last visit. The shelves are all lower and items are better organized. I love shopping here and find the changed refreshing. Wonderful selection of diverse foods and excellent service.</text>

This place was originally known as Marukai, I'm not sure when they changed the name. Inside you can find a couple small restaurants, groceries, and novelty products.

Downstairs, they have a large selection of meats, vegetables and drinks/beer. Also available are many Japanese snacks and candy (these alone make a trip worth it in my opinion).

Upstairs, their products range from furniture to figurines. They have a lot of novelty and comfort items, including the full size pajamas with a hood known as kigurumi, and blind boxes containing random cute figurines.

This store can make for a fun browsing experience, and can also satisfy a grocery trip. I can only caution that with all of the neat things they have here is that you might spend more money than you plan to.<//Text>

I've been going here since I was young and I love it. You do need a membership to buy anything. All the food is mostly Japanese. Upstairs they have furniture and clothes. They do sell sake/alcohol. There's a small restaurant inside when you first walk in. It's a nice Japanese grocery store to go to once in a while if you don't live close to one like I do.</review>

I bought a sushi they didn’t put soy sauce and chopsticks.
How can I eat Sushi 🍣 without soy sauce.
Register person didn’t ask if you need chopsticks and soy sauce.

Huge selection of Japanese foods. Seafood selection is great although it can be pricey. Also great selection of beef, pork, and poultry. They just went through a massive interior remodel. Much nicer to go through....not as cramp as it use to be.</Text>

As it's probably been already said, this is the Costco of Japanese goods. For a few minutes, it makes me believe I'm back im Japan. Selection is amazing, prices are good. The prepared foods used to be lacking, but since the remodel, the selection is greatly improved. A nice bonus: The food court amazing kara-age and takoyaki.<//Text>

<pics>None< /pics><Date>1571717517356<//Date><response>None</response><Text>I love this Japanese market. It is HUGE. The sushi section is awesome. It rivals any restaurant sushi for 2/3 of the price. Fresh and yummy. Besides all the great Japanese and Hawaiian grocery items they have a whole area with plates, rice cookers, and kitchenware as well as a gift and pop toy section upstairs. They also have a wellness area.

I also like the fresh mochi and desserts they each week from Fugetsu Do and the hot food restaurants inside. From karage to Gindaco, a ramen place, a tonkatsu place, and a Japanese pastry shop. They also have a croquette and onigiri deli in the corner as well as karage.

If you want bug cuts of fish for sushi, simply go to the butchery in the back of the store.

The Tokyo Central in Torrance is much smaller and driving to the one in Gardena is worth it.< /Text><UserId.>106210465058348380873< /UserId.></record>

I recommend this place especially for anyone that cooks, and is looking for Japanese ingredients.  The perishables here are generally more fresh than what you're likely to find at similar Japanese markets in the area.  You can also find prepared food, kitchen goods, cosmetics, and various knickknacks all in one convenient location.
Note though that the discounted prices throughout the market require a membership card at the cost of $1 (with no recurring fees).< /Review>

Great place to find Japanese essentials for cooking and cosmetics that are typically found only in Japan. Has a wide variety of snacks, fresh fish, cooking necessities, and Japanese imported goods. Has been recently renovated and has new eateries inside. Was perviouly Marukai.</text>

So far I'd say this place has the best takoyaki in Los Angeles area! The size of the takoyakis are bigger than the usual which is a plus. They're made to order so they're very fresh. Most places serve the takoyaki with the insides slightly undercooked and way too soft but this place does it right!<//Text>

Deli, fresh sushi counter, a few fast food stands, inside & outside eating areas, grocery store with impressive selections of Japanese goods, very fresh produce, well stocked liquor area (could not find Okinawan saki unfortunately). The downstairs also houses a separate cosmetics section, it is so big it is a little overwhelming & I honestly didn't know what half the stuff was meant for since I'm not able to read the letters. It also has a separate appliances area with rice cookers and small things like that. The upstairs has all the fun stuff. Things like kimonos (some moderate priced used ones) wooden sandals, cute hair clips, Zen gardens, lucky cats, dolls, trinkets, stuffed animals, crazy socks, kigurumi (onesies), costumes, models, Pokemon stuff.
Also, everyone that works here is super helpful if you have questions about anything so don't hesitate to ask.

My badge in clear sight.

As I approached the register,
i noted there was a guest services.

There were 2 women there.

I spoke to the older of the 2.

Without hesitation she quickly replied no.

I noted the registers all around were giving change.

I repeated are you sure?

She did not give a reason.
For example,

I had to " Purchase" something,
or it's their policy not to give Change!

She did neither, nor offer any explanation.

Her eyes and Body language suggested me out the door quickly.
I am on duty,
well groomed, dressed in uniform.

The wrong nationality in my opinion.

As I sit here writing this,
I can still see the the look in her eyes.
Her body language left me feeling..

Like a Foreigner in his Homeland!

It's kind of ironic, as I was born
in Japan & am of Indian and English descent!
Therefore I am a Native to this land...

Tonight and throughout the holidays I will put the word out to my Family, Friends and the Department Not!

To shop @ Tokyo Central Market.

My go to place for Hawaiian cravings. Decent prices and a rather large selection. The majority of the product tags now have an English description which helps if unfamiliar with the products. The best part is the food court. They have the best fried rice in town.< /text>

< Review>
The Gardena store is currently remodeling. Slightly disorganized. But will have lots of variety when completed. Results in  higher prices. But store will be nice. Store workers are extremely kind and helpful in locating products.</Review>

My go to place for Hawaiian cravings. Decent prices and a rather large selection. The majority of the product tags now have an English description which helps if unfamiliar with the products. The best part is the food court. They have the best fried rice in town.<//Text>

Probably one of the largest Japanese markets in the Southland. You can get anything from electric goods, rice cookers, air pots, Japanese style plates and bowls to produce, meat, seafood and just about every sauce and condiment used in Japanese cooking.</text>

No real issues but they seem to be changing their product mix to cater to demand? More ready to eat packages. Less traditional pastries and sushi. Large Spam selection which i have never seen before.< /Text>

I love to go there shopping for goodies from Japan and Hawaii. They have a food court there and love to eat quick lunch there. I also like to get quick sushi or bento for dinner while shopping for grocery there. Must go place to shop for meats for Chinese hotpot or Japanese shabu shabu there. Tokyo Central Market usually have better pricing than Nijiya or Mitsuwa.< /Review>

Very nice Japanese store with lots of goodies. There is an upstairs so this place is pretty big. The only negative thing I would say about the store is ,the prices are really kinda on the high end. Very clean and very friendly staff.</Text>

Our experience at the Okonomiyaki food court was the worst.    Awful tasting yakisoba and okonomiyaki my husband and I have ever tasted in all the years we’ve been enjoy eating them.  They do not seem to know the very basics of making an okonomiyaki  that truly
disappointed us.  Will never be going back!
Could’ve spent $35 on better tasting choice!!!
HORRIBLE!!!!< /review>

<review>Has many of the things that those looking for Japanese will be able to find. Everything from tontatsu to kotatsu. If you are looking for prepared food stuffs like bento or onigiri, get there early as they tend to run out mid afternoon. But if you happen to miss out, there is a food court where you can get your fix for takoyaki, donburi, ramen, etc< /review>< Pictures>

Great supermarket for Asian Produce, cookware and Food products.  My family has been going to Marukai ever since their previous location over 20+ years.  They have extensive variety here on all types of foods including Fresh fish, Cooked foods, drinks, Desserts, Vegetables, and condiments.<//text>

Great place to get Japanese grocery items. It has a small food court where you can get a quick lunch from various vendors selling basic noodles/rice dishes ann more.<//Review>

If you want authentic Japanese goods and grocery then this is the place. Store recently remodeled, labels now have description in English so you know what the product is used for. Perhaps this is in response to a changing demographic visiting the store.</review>

<review>I love to go there shopping for goodies from Japan and Hawaii. They have a food court there and love to eat quick lunch there. I also like to get quick sushi or bento for dinner while shopping for grocery there. Must go place to shop for meats for Chinese hotpot or Japanese shabu shabu there. Tokyo Central Market usually have better pricing than Nijiya or Mitsuwa.<//review>< Rate>

Great shop for asain foods and things you wont find in other stores, hige selection of mushrooms and veggies, they have a massive sushi bar of fresh made sushi as long as the butcher counter in any other grocery store. There are also a few restaurants in the front entry of the grocery store and they each are awesome. They have a japanese fried chicken spot there that is OMG good food.< /Review>

THE PLASE for most everything you need  from Japan in huge space.  foods and living needs but most I recomend are the beauty needs for girls! You find most interesting updated things here for makeups and Body care. Expect to spend hours once you get in but make sure you are  equipped with interpretation somehow if you want to find each products instructions but it worth doing that if you know the quality of them. You need time and a little extra money to go there.< /Review>

Be careful when buying prepared fried food. Some may be burnt and greasy. Mileage may vary. Continuous remodeling-head up, things move around some. Nice place to shop for items. Know your prices on non Asian items, some things are higher than expected.<//Text>

<review>It had a little bit of everything. So there's an appreciation for them having a place to get groceries, and other random household tidbits. There's even a small section for Gundam kits. What made this place amazing was the Gindaco that's near the entrance, truly delicious takoyaki. I will recommend this place just based on that eatery.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b56685ac2169:0xae5fe05abe26b2<//gmap_id></record>

<text>This is my to-go place with my dad and my husband. We love shopping for groceries while I can get makeup on the 2nd floor. I also love buying kitchen hardwares and accessories here. The price is fair and you’ll probably find that many items are actually cheaper than Amazon

Tips:

sushi section gets discounted from the market price (15%, 20% and 30% ) few hours before the end of day. )

Great quality Shabu meat with fair price here!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

Interesting items for sale. Good food in the small food court. Always buy Asian items in an Asian store, almost always cheaper than "American" stores.< /Review>

This is large supermarket packed with asian groceries. They have monthly events usually themed with certain produces, region from Japan or festival theme. Its very fun to try out imported lical Japanese food. The location also has a large area where they sell Japanese goods that are handy for many people. Also they have packed lunch, side dish, and snacks that you can pick up.< /text>

If you are looking for Japanese grocery and goods, this is the right place. The Japanese grocery selection is pretty good and the meat and fish section is clean and provide fresh product comparable, if not better, to the quality of top-tier American markets.</Review>

They have remodeled the interior  to make it more open and it is a nice improvement, the aisle  used to be narrow with products  stacked above your head now it's easier for us old folks.</Review>

I'm a Hawaii native, so I've been exposed to a lot of American-Japanese food/culture/etc, and this place is easily the BEST Japanese market I've ever been to. If you're into Hawaiian food, there's multiple aisles of stuff I've literally never seen outside of Hawaii before --- authentic portugeuse sausage, lau lau, every single type of sugary drink (POG, passion orange, etc), even frozen Zippys meals (!!!)

From a Japanese standpoint, everything is not only directly imported, but there are little English descriptions of all the foods on the price labels. All the staff are super courteous, and the food court attached is out of this world!

A real shining star here is the sushi --- it's cheaper, fresher, and tastier than you'll be able to get anywhere else that I've ever seen. There's also an authentic Japanese curry stand in the back corner where you can get all kinds of amazing curry dishes. The food court has some of the best karaage chicken I've ever had, and this is the first time I've seen an authentic takoyaki stand in LA.

All in all, amazing service, amazing prices, and a must-go for anybody who loves Japanese food.<//review>

Marukai is the place to go to for all your Japanese & Hawaiian grocery needs. They are a good deal cheaper than Mitsuwa and have a far greater selection. Make sure to jump in their website to look at their weekly deals, because you can find some huge savings on highly sought after items.< /text>

If you need Asian foods, this is your place. The staff were friendly and helpful. Items from a number of differing Asian cuisines as well as sake, beers from Asia and liquors from Japan, and soju from south Korea. The store has an odd layout.< /Text>

At the beginning me & my Family were excited to come here since it's no longer Marukai. The employees we're unwelcoming & unhelpful contrast to the Marukai we knew before. Furthermore we will now be shopping at Daiso & Ranch Market where it won't be ackward cuz your not ASAIN & shopping at these stores. Such a let down SMH....< /Review>

I was shocked Marukai was bought our by Tokyo Market. Then I went in and was blown away. I liked Marukai selection of Japanese raw fish, vegetables and shabu shabu thin sliced raw meat. Tokyo market is 5 times better than Marukai. The employees are friendlier as well. I'm so excited that a Tokyo Market too over. I bought shishimi boat and loved ut. The kobe beef shabu is awesome. Love thus place</text>

This Japanese market is literally my go to for all of my asian grocery needs. Its kind of far for me sincei live in the San Fernando valley but it's worth the trip! I also love the food there! Soooooo good! The takoyaki is to die for! I'm from Hawaii so it's hard to find groceries like at home but this place makes me miss home a bit less.<//Review>

Nijiya is a good place to run in fast to get a few items, but for  the sheer variety of goods such as reasonable cosmetics, Sakè (sah keh), Japanese beers, Sho-chu-/Japanese lower alcohol Vodkas, snacks, produce, Japanese food in cans, frozen, plastic, produce Tokyo Central can't be beat.

There is something for everybody, at least for those interested in Japanese products.  If you're in here for the first time prepare to stay for about an hour to see what is available & acquant yourself to the layout. The proof is in the pudding; you have to go there.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b56685ac2169:0xae5fe05abe26b2</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Boo to memberships. That being said, you can still enter and purchase items without a membership. They will charge an extra dollar and you don’t get the sale prices, but at least you can still shop. They have one day memberships available if needed. The top floor is filled with Japanese items such as traditional clothing, furniture and unique décor items and the main floor is filled to the brim with Japanese and Hawaiian groceries. On weekends there are sample food carts dishing out simple Japanese dishes to try. The food court is small but sufficient. Avoid at all costs around New Years.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>I like this Japanese market.  It's a weird mix where the downstairs area has an area for gadgets and items, and a grocery, while the upstairs has furniture.  I stocked up on frozen Saba (Mackerel), Kewpie mayo, and bought some meat for Shabu Shabu.</review>< user_name>

<Time>1532326046954<//Time><Text>This place has it all as far as a Japanese style market goes.

It has all the dry goods to make whats popular at home. All the frozen goods to take home and eat and also a nice little fiod court area to get some pretty decent food.

The Store also has a floral area and a toys/Japanese hobby section even have the paints you need to paint them. Pretty cool!

There lots of cool japanese nicknacks and little gifts if you want to gift some one something cool.

The makeup area is massive. I think this is the second biggest part of the store. Ir has everything iou would need as far as makup is concerned. Cheap too. I mean its not a Sephora but you get the picture.

There is a ready food are that is nice to pick up a quick sushi roll or even a nagiri or rice roll. Im surprised i never have been here sooner. I always just go to Marukai, But this place I beleive is a branch off of Marukai in Torrance. So a hit!

If your looking for something Japanese. This is the place. For sure!<//Text></record>

<review>Very bad, looks to be under new ownership and not doing well. The store layout has been ruined and shopping in a majority of the store is impossible. The products seen to be the same or similar to one the previous Marukai carried. I do not recommend shopping during busy hours.<//review></record>

<text>They have POG. I love Hawaii and I love Hawaiian Mai Tais and the best ones are made with the truly Hawaiian drink of POG. I scoured the internet trying to find a place in SoCal (Los Angeles area) I could get POG and someone recommendes Marukai, and sure enough, they have it! Besides the original POG brand, they even have another brand that is basically the same thing just in case. So excited to find POG in the LA area. Besides that this is a true Japanese market with all authentic imported Japanese (and some Hawaiian) foods.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

My family has been going here for years and, more often than not, we always find what we need. The prices can skew a little high on some items, I find that I can usually do my produce shopping elsewhere and save a little, but in general the prices are fine. It can get a little cramped inside on weekends and you should absolutely be prepared for a wait in the checkout line. For years I shopped at their satellite store in West Covina (closed now, sadly) and while it was much closer that was about the only thing it had up on the Gardena store. Consistently clean and, aside from one experience with a belligerent employee, the staff is great. I've tried most of their competitors over the years and have consistently come back to Marukai.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This is one of the better Marukais. They have everything that you could want.  The service sucks, though.  It serves the Nisei (2nd gen) crowd vs Mitsuwa or Nijiya which serves more of the Issei (1st gen) or Japanese transplant crowd.
Marukai is generally the cheapest of the 3 Japanese market chains, but I feel that the quality also suffers a bit.  Korean markets are cheapest for pretty much everything, so if you have a good Korean market nearby, I would generally opt to go there over Marukai.</review>

< Review>
I heart Murakai so much. I am much closer to the Little Tokyo location, but what I love about the Gardena Murakai is that it is way bigger and never gets as crowded as the Little Tokyo one. (We all want to avoid that moment when you and an elderly lady are eyeing that last packet of whatever...and you briefly wonder if it's socially acceptable to elbow her out of the way.)

I usually pick up saimin ingredients, my favorite snacks, and other packaged items so I can't speak for any of the hot food or even packaged pastries there...but they always have what I need and then some. Sure, I need a mini stapler and a panda-shaped mug. Sure, I need taro pancake mix and strawberry Kit Kats. Why the eff not? The cashiers are super nice as well.

I did knock off a star because I happened to use the bathroom once and it was...not pretty. Also, the place in general is grungy (probably just old) but well-organized and the aisles are always clean.<//Review>

I shop here all the time, but their fruits are rotten sometimes. I bought 2 white peaches last night. Both of them are rotten.
It's a shame your $ and time are wasted.</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very well stocked Japanese supermarket. They sell prepared food ready to go. You will find all kinds of ingredients to prepare traditional Japanese food. The food prepared while later it is, they lower the price as they do in the supermarkets in Japan. If you want to try traditional Japanese fast food this is the best place. I visited it with my nephews and we brought many snacks and instant soups to try at home, my nephews were delighted and we returned the next day to buy more. Due to the covid they offer masks to be able to enter in case they forgot. I found some merchandising products from Studio Ghibli. The supermarket is worth a visit. The next time I travel to Los Angeles I will visit them again.

Supermercado japonés muy bien surtido. Venden comida preparada lista para llevar. Encontrarán todo tipo de ingredientes para preparar comida tradicional japonesa. La comida preparada mientras más tarde es, le rebajan el precio como lo hacen en los supermercados en Japón. Si desean probar comida rápido tradicional japonesa este es el mejor lugar. Lo visité con mis sobrinos y llevamos muchos snacks y sopas instantaneas para probar en casa, mis sobrinos quedaron encantados y regresamos el día siguiente a comprar más. Por el covid ofrecen mascarillas para poder ingresar por si se les olvidó.  Encontré algunos productos merchandising de Studio Ghibli. Vale la pena visitar el supermercado. La próxima vez que viaje a Los Angeles volveré visitarlos.</text>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Come here especially, but things are expensive. Nothing special, the second floor and the first floor are separate. It is recommended to go shopping on the second floor before going down.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Christmas was very helpful during my long vacation. Overall cheap. Feeling that the level of prepared food and food court has risen. The next time I go, I will go more often.

<review>(Translated by Google) A new bakery made in this. Or, it is a croissant shop. it's the best.
But it is not reflected in the map yet.
Well, I will go again next time, so I'll take photos and upload it at that time.
However, anyway, plain croissants are that size, with that crispness, and they are too happy about $ 1.80.
Bread was also the best. Together, I bought too much and exceeded $ 30 ...

Tokyo Central (formerly Marukai) has changed little. No matter when you go, you will be satisfied and a little dissatisfied. (Lol) Although it is natural, there is no choice but to be high in Japanese products, but if it is too expensive ... 
Also, are all the food court shops? It has changed. If there is a silver duck, if it is $ 6.50 it is a price you can buy without hesitating to that! I thought I was going to buy it, but a man in front of me asked something strangely and it took me a while (I was about to buy a couple of minutes, so nearly 5 minutes, I asked a clerk I was abandoned because there was not enough time.

No, Takoyaki, I thought that it was not so much trouble to buy ... But, if it was a stranger, I guess I have to ask them everything. 
If it is only ordinary Takoyaki, nobody needs to worry (mayonnaise it is not possible to wear it or not, is it about blue clouds?) Just looking at it, since various kinds of photographs were pasted, the first person It may be more annoying.

この中にできた新しいパン屋さん。というか、クロワッサン屋さん。最高です。
でもまだ、マップに反映されてないんだね。
じゃ、また今度行くから、その時は写真も撮ってアップします。
でも、とにかく、プレーンのクロワッサンが、あの大きさで、あのパリパリ感で、しかも、＄1.80とか、嬉しすぎる。
食パンも最高でした。ついつい、買いすぎて30ドル超えた・・・

東京セントラル（旧マルカイ）は、ほとんど変わってないかな。いつ行っても、満足するし、ちょっと不満足。（笑）あたりまえだけど、日本の商品が高いのは仕方ないんだけど、あまりに高額になっていると・・・
あと、フードコートのお店は全部？変わったんだね。銀だこがあって、＄6.50ならそこまで躊躇せずに買える値段だ！って思って買うつもりだったんだけど、私の前の男性がなにか異様に質問したりして、時間かかってて（私が買おうと後ろに並んでからゆうに5分近くは、店員さんに質問してた）時間がそこまでなかったのもあって、断念。

いや、たこ焼きって、そんなに悩んで買うしろもんじゃないだろ・・・って思いながら、でも、知らない人だったら、やっぱりいろいろと、聞かないといけないんだろうね。
普通のたこ焼きだけなら、誰も悩む必要ないけど（マヨネーズつけるかつけないかぐらい？青のりは？ってぐらいなのかな？）ぱらっと見ただけで、いろんな種類の写真が貼ってあったから、初めての人はなおさら悩むかもね。</review><rating>4</rating>< gmapID>
