<review>Valente is very professional. He took his time explaining everything to me in details and answered all of my questions!  After searching for weeks I am thankful I found him. He gave me the best price hassle free! I most definitely recommend him if you are in need for some insurance!</review>< pictures>

Requested a quote for a lunch truck. Valente was very professional and Answered all my questions. He also provided me with diffrent choices of insurance policy, without ever forcing me to chose the most expensive one. I will defenetly recommend state farm and work with Valente again for his professional attitude.</Review>

I bought my car on a Saturday. My salesperson called four other insurance agents. Valente was the only who responded to the salesperson. I went to his office in Norwalk. I was able to get my car insurance coverage the same day. I was able to take my car home on that Saturday. Anytime I have had to call Valente office they always answer. I am able to make whatever changes. I need to make when I call. I would recommend Valente for your insurance needs.< /Text>

They have different specialty donuts each day and they are scrumptious! We had a vanilla chocolate and a maple bacon one, not too sweet, just right. Tiny tiny coffees, $3. I know that sounds cheap but I’m not from California and it was the size of my thumb. But, with that said, everything is priced in accordance with the cost of living there and it was not a huge shock. The coffee was delightful, regardless.
Quick service! Right near the water so it’s nice if you want to grab a bite before continuing to explore Or once you’re done too!< /review>

Nice spot for grabbing a coffee and espresso when walking the marina. Espresso was excellent, bonus points for having ‘real’ cups and not only paper ones!</review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>I've had some Dynamo donuts before and they're alright. Last time I went here was post-run with a group of women who split a donut and all seemed to really like it. I think it might be cash only? The nice part of this location is it's right on the water, so it's very pleasant to grab some coffee or coffee and donut and sit outside.</Review>< Pics>

Solid hot chocolate, which used housemade chocolate syrup—not a powder. Minus one star ‘cause they were out of whipped cream.

Great views, but bring a jacket!<//review>

Perfect location if you're touring around the Embarcadero in San Francisco. It's right before Crissy Field, the restored wetlands that leads up to Ft. Point and the Golden Gate Bridge. If you're on a bicycle or walking, great place for a quick stop. You can eat right there, or head over to the water, about 200 yards away, with benches and plenty of places to take your doughnuts with you. Great place for people-watching as walkers and runners all pass right by. Dynamo specializes in weird flavors, though, which may or may not be what you want. A little pricey, too. And the hours are limited, so check on that ahead of time. But it's a cool little place and a neat way to get off your feet for a bit.</Text>

<Review>Mouth watering, rich lattes. The donuts are very good too!! It's a little hut with a bench and a couple of small tables around it so I wouldn't bank on a sit-down coffee session at this place though if you do get a seat, the views are very nice.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>The guy working is a great barista, and super honest. The square card reader he was using double charged me, something I didn't find out till the next day, where I also found a credit back. Super honest, great latte, all around nice place.

Will be back the next time I'm in town.< /Review>< UserId.>

Next time you have anything wrong w your drivetrain, go immediately to see Adrian at Driveshaft Pro.  I had this really annoying vibration at speed in my 68 Ford and no one could figure it out.  Adrian had the car up on a lift and the shaft on the balancer in 5 minutes and immediately knew this was the problem.  For the next 45 minutes his expert team of perfectionists spun and balanced and spun and balanced and measured the shaft.  It’s so rare anymore to find anyone who takes pride in their work and these guys really do.  They then finished the job by sanding it down and putting a fresh coat of paint on it.  They bolted it back in, Adrian jumped in with me, and we hammered the go pedal up the 605.  Absolutely zero vibration from the drive train for the first time ever.  I’m so happy, if I could give 10 stars I would.  Thanks guys!<//text>

Great service and great guys to work with! Adrian and Ben were very accommodating with my custom driveshaft for my Infiniti, and their work is top shelf. Would highly recommend! Excellent prices as well.

Had some issues after installation and they had me bring my car in and put it on the lift to look at  and helped solve it at no cost! Great follow through!< /review>

Found this place on Google.  Best customer service hands down. They made me a new drive shaft for my 1972 Ford Pinto, it works perfect. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a Pro.</Text>

Adrian helped me with putting in a new drive shaft with u joins, helped me diagnose some issues with my pinion angle as well. He let me call him for advice for problem solving and gave me good insight from his experience.
Cant thank him enough, great shop and does excellent work !</review>

Adrian and his crew do honest good work. Verry experienced, knowledgeable, and the latest  equipments. They were able to balanced and rectified issues with  2 driveshafts other shops couldn't. Had I went to them first, I could've save a lot of time and frustration.< /Review>

Great work balancing my driveshaft, my Jeep drives smooth as glass now. Editing this because they once again saved the day, my front OEM driveshaft went out so my buddy gave me one off his Jeep since he’s dropping in a hemi but told me it had a couple of issues. I said, “no problem, I know where to take it”.

I dropped it off yesterday and was told that it’s be $280 to fix it because there was a damaged part but they could do a quick fix for about $100 to get me by, I said cool ok. I went to pick it up this morning and guess what? They fixed it up for much less and said I didn’t need anything else.

When it comes time to build a 1350 D.S I’m coming back here, you don’t find this kind of honesty and service too often anymore.

Adrian is a cool dude and will fix you up.<//Review>

called to get a driveshaft lengthened  gave me a price of $75 plus steel price  and said he would have it done in 1 day (seemed fair)  got there and it needed something different but he couldn't commit to a actual finish time and wanted 2 days .. i had a bad feeling about the guy after some of the comments he made  so i decided to take it to someone else that has more knowledge on 4X4 driveshafts   i guess if you have no timeline they may be a ok place but that doesn't work for my business< /review>

Needed to know if the center mount on the driveshaft could be replaced by their company. The car is still drivable and is my daily. The answer I got was "I don't know. You'll have to take it off the car, bring it in and then I'll tell you if it's replaceable" That's a BS answer from a "professional" shop. I guess they don't have the experience they say they do and never heard of Google to see the driveshaft. Taking a driveshaft off a daily driven car and taking it to a shop that's only open Mon-Fri is not the most realistic thing. I'll find another driveshaft company that actually tries. Thanks.....for nothing Jose!</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1536368777892, 'text': 'Joe, We honestly appreciate your feedback.  If we did not have this we would not be able to improve.  To defend Jose... he is a tech that occasionally covers phones when Adrian (the store manager) has to step out.  The correct answer you are seeking is yes, we can replace the center support bearing on these Passats.  In fact, we even have a complete shaft that we can build from scratch if required.  If you would allow us to make it right, please email us at sales@driveshaftpro.com with your contact info, or try calling us at 714-462-1199.  Ask for Bryan.  I will be happy to help you out.  I am very sorry for your poor experience today.  We will make sure we take measures to avoid this from happening again.  It is inexcusable.

<Review>Had the good fortunes to work with this law firm. They did a marvelous job. Mr. Andy Warshaw studied our case, He and we knew that we are dealing with a tough case and a tough adversary, however we had to work hard and smart as we were right. He put several plans, A, B , and C with the objective to proof our innocence, avoid damage, but surprisingly also to minimize the legal expenses ( meaning his company billing to his client ). Having dealt with several lawyers in the past, I never met someone with such care and professionalism.

Because the attorney (Andy) and the client (Myself) believed in our case, the cooperation was excellent and we achieved proof of innocence, total avoidance of damage, and an unbelievable low cost.

I will recommend the Financial Relief Law Center APC to one and all without reservation. You will be truly in good hands.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>The team was awesome at helping us resolve a commercial real estate lease agreement that we were trying to buy out of. Everyone we dealt with was extremely responsive and felt like they were on our side, even to the point of billing. Usually I feel like lawyers bill anything and everything. With these guys, I feel like I was underbilled for the time the lawyers put into this project. Great value.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I would like to highly recommend bankruptcy attorney, Amanda Billyard and her law firm, Financial Relief Law Center.  I have just received my discharge letter from a very complicated and somewhat, high value bankruptcy.  I owe the extremely beneficial outcome and smooth sailing throughout, to Ms. Billyard.  Let me also give a big shout out to Victor Ugarte for all his help in coordinating the many moving pieces.  Like I said, it was an extremely complicated bankruptcy and Ms. Billyard used her steady hand and sound legal expertise to deliver this fantastic result.  I throughly recommend Ms. Billyard and her firm Legal Relief Law Center. 🏆 🏆 🏆 🙏 🙏

I had been putting off filing for bankruptcy for several years. However, the current pandemic made it more difficult to make the money I needed to pay off my debt.  I called Financial Relief Law Center and Victor was very helpful in explaining everything about the process and very up front about how everything would go.  Amanda was also excellent in getting me through all of this.  I was dreading filing for bankruptcy, but they made this quick and painless.  I am eternally thankful to both of them and highly recommend Financial Relief Law Center to anyone who needs help getting out of bad financial situations.<//text>

<Review>To Financial Relief Law Center, APC- Thank you to Victor and Amanda for their great work in helping me to alleviate all my debts and start anew. After a few short months I was able to alleviate vehicle debts and credit card debt. Victor and Amanda were very personable and responsive to all questions and knew exactly how to handle the situation. I highly recommend them for anyone looking to file bankruptcy.</Review>< Time>

I contacted the firm to assist me with my foreclosure process. Both Ronda and Victor they are amazing. Victor was my original point of contact. He assisted me through the initial intake process and answered all questions I had about my loan modification. Ronda was my second point of contact, she was my operations manager through my entire process. Ronda is very knowledgeable advised me of the pros and cons. She is always available and answered all my questions. She walk me through the entire process keeping me updated at all times. The entire team is very efficient and the entire process took less than 3 months for my approval.  I highly recommend this firm to all my family and friends and anyone who is in need of legal help.

Financial Relief Law Center was absolutely the best choice. I was looking for a way that could protect my assets when the debt relief is too slow to handle my financial burden then collection agencies & banks were chasing me with a civil case. So I googled about a debt relief law firm, Financial Relief Law Center appeared. I called up & spoke to Victor Ugarte, he’s the man who takes care of your business, walk you thru the process before he books you to a lawyer. He’s helpful, considerate, kind & compassionate. This law firm deals with what help they can do for you and won’t judge you about how you get yourself in such financial mess. As a person who made wrong financial choices like myself, you really need to be in a place where you feel welcome without judgment & prejudice. Ask help to people who really wants to help you get out of your mess & protect you against the pressure of the collection agency. My lawyer Andy Warshaw, who was tall, young & smart. He’s young but his his experience as a lawyer was outstanding. He was a beacon of hope at a time when my options were limited. Not only was he able to lay out options for a resolution to protect my assets, his calm & empathetic demeanor offered emotional succor when I filed for bankruptcy chapter 13. The thought of bankruptcy was scary but he explained it well and it was the best decision I made. I am eternally grateful for his service and I definitely recommend Financial Relief Law Center without reservation. You are in good hands.<//Text>

I highly recommend FRLC to anyone looking for assistance.  Amanda Billyard and the FRLC staff are incredible.  They do all the work and coordination; I only needed to submit documentation.  FRLC literally does the rest.  Moreover, Amanda is always burning the midnight oil, following up out of hours and weekends if necessary.  Ensuring I was informed, up to date and never guessing.<//text>

I am so happy that I chose Financial Relief Law Center to help me with filing bankruptcy ch. 7. They were not only professional, but kind, courteous and non judgmental. Victor was amazing at helping me with any questions that I had and making sure that I understood everything that was happening clearly. He is really easy to talk to and quick to respond via email, phone call, or text message. Filing bankruptcy was an intimidating thought to me, but after meeting with Amanda she guided me through all the steps and helped me to feel comfortable. It was such an easy process with the help of these two and I am so grateful to them. They worked with me on a payment plan building up to actually filing with the courts which really made this possible for me to do. Having Amanda by my side in court took away a lot of my fear and thankfully my debt was discharged in August 2019. If you are thinking of filing for bankruptcy give Financial Relief Law Center a call - you won't be disappointed!< /review>

I ran into a financial issue from my past and was in need of legal direction to take so I could handle a bank account that was levied. I called at 4:30 on a Friday after Christmas and Victor promptly called me back within minutes. Very nice and helpful. sent over document minutes after I got off the phone with him. made me feel a lot better about the situation and got me started in the right direction to solve my problem. if you are in a financial situation I would recommend giving them a try!</text>< pics>

It was a horrible experience dealing with Chase directly. Chase was giving me a run around for so long and I was getting absolutely nowhere that I finally decided to get legal service’s help. I started looking for legal services and did a search on the Internet and saw that's what Financial Relief Law Center did. I gave them a call and have talked with Victor & Max and they told me about their service, what they do; and I did some research on them, talked with them actually several times and then I decided to use their services.
After that I have been working with Stacey, Angelica and Rhonda who did an amazing job getting all paperwork ready, initiating the process and negotiating terms with Chase. Special thanks to Ronda who spend a great deal with me and working with Chase for months and have never backed out. Ronda was constantly in contact with me updating me on the progress. Eventually the issue with Chase has been resolved with very positive outcome and all of this wouldn’t be possible without hard work that has been done by the Financial Relief Law Center team.
I would like to thank everyone in this highly professional and an amazing team who has made it happened!!!!!! Thank you Guys!!!! You have done a great Job!!!!

So glad I found the Financial Relief Law Center. Andy was very professional and supportive during our difficult bankruptcy process. The closing of our business was stressful enough but we were blessed to have Andy and his team prepare our bankruptcy.

Andy has been very responsive and involved with every step. I shopped attorneys before choosing FRLC and the others seemed like car salesmen. Choosing Andy and his team was among the best professional choices I've made.

Our case was resolved exactly as they said it would.< /Review>

I'm not sure why I ended up calling them, but I'm happy I did. The first person I spoke to was Viktor. He was so helpful and polite on the phone. He gave me guidance, ever though I told him I wasn't sure if I was going to use their services.
In the end I did go through them and I'm so happy I did. They were so helpful and always there for me when I reached out. My loan mod. took almost two years to be completed, but I never once got worried...well that's not true, I did once, but they were there for me and reassured me it was going to be fine. The end results were amazing.
I highly recommend this company. They are trustworthy and will be on your side.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf540b981501:0xe27d523edb25a45b<//Gmap_id><userid>111970864641482297667</userid><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Andy helped me with a case a few years back and was outstanding from day one. Everything that was promised was delivered as such in a prompt and professional manner.

Andy got back to me same day, remembered all the facts of my case, and jumped in to assist me immediately, even though it was over the holiday time period, which can be difficult to reach people. Great customer service backed by solid talent is a combination sometimes tough to find.

Gosh... You may have never thought you'd be seeking to "file". Bankruptcy was a "daunting time" for me... It felt like as shroud of clouds was lingering in the upper regions of my mind. However, that quickly evaporated when Andy Warshaw came into the scene! Enabling a drastic shift in "mental & emotional climate". Clearing the fog, and providing a guiding light to finding a place of rest. finally... peace of mind! Thank you immensely, Andy Warshaw and Financial Relief Law Center, APC. Very Grateful. Specialized Professionals. Excellent Care.< /Review>

The entire staff has been most professional and compassionate. Each person on the team did an excellent job in keeping in contact with me.  Especially  Victor Ugarte!  He always called back or emailed & addressed all of my concerns & problems.  I would highly recommend Financial Relief Law Center for your financial needs.</Review>

I was extremely reluctant on hiring these guys due to the horror stories I heard other people experienced with similar companies offering the same kind of services. These guys were extremely professional and always available to help me with all the ridiculous amount of paperwork the bank sent me. Financial Relief help me get through a really rough time in my life and thanks to them I get to keep my house. Max, Angelika and Rhonda you guys are the best.< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
No one likes considering the fact they need to consult with a bankruptcy attorney but if you do, let me save you the trouble of researching elsewhere since I already did it.

I was referred by my wife who had utilized the Financial Relief Law Center several years ago and I was paired up with Andy Warshaw. What I didn't know at the time on how lucky I was for having Andy as my attorney. Most other attorneys were fairly dismissive of my situation but Andy fought for me and literally saved me over $100,000 on a severely complicated case.  Andy fought for me where others would have given up.

Bankruptcy Attorney's all have to charge the same amount so why give your money to some other attorney who will treat you like a number? From the first call with Victor to my many calls with Andy, I felt welcomed and reassured. As someone who has worked in the field of law for 10 years, I couldn't recommend Andy Warshaw and the people of Financial Relief Law Center Enough!!<//review>

To whom this may concern:

My experience with  Financial Relief Law Center has been outstanding. The circumstances that I was dealing with were emotionally very trying. The care and attention from Victor Ugarte and Ronda Miner has been exceptional. They have stayed a step ahead of the situation regarding a potential loss of my home. They have taken care of the details and clearly communicated the situation. I would highly recommend their services.

<Text>I was facing a law suit in which I believed the only answer was to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  I was directed to Andrew Warshaw at the Financial Relief Law Center.  He was able to negotiate an agreement outside of court which saved me hundreds of thousands of dollars and prevented me from filing Chapter 11.  I am forever grateful and highly recommend Andrew and the FRLC team!</Text>< user_id>

When I first started looking for someone to represent me for my home modification I searched numerous web sites. After talking on the phone with Financial Relief Law Center they recommended that I check out BBB on them and their web site. I felt good about them and decided to go with them I'am very glad I did because they did everything they said they would do they even had me take notes when they were talking about the modification phase. They are the #1 team out there.<//Text>

We had tried 4 times to modify our home with our bank and was rejected all 4 times. We came across Financial Relief Law Center in the mail and decided to try it out. WOW!!! They were on the spot, returning calls, very thorough step by step, and very friendly. The time we started until we were accepted for a modification was around 4 months. Everything went smoothly and they fought for us to to end. I highly recommend this company. I still am in tears thinking that we get to stay in our home, when we were losing hope. Victor, Max, Angelika and Rhonda Thank you!!<//text>

Approximately 2 years ago, I was in the midst of a foreclosure and received a call from Victor Ugarte at Financial Relief Law Center. There was something about his caring voice and warm demeanor that made me feel I could trust him and his team. And now
I know my instincts were right! Thank you to Victor Ugarte, Claudia Arias and Jessica Griffith for helping me in a time of dire need. Financial Relief Law Center truly cares about helping people and are not trying to take advantage of people like so many other
agencies do when someone is in a foreclosure. I would highly recommend this firm to anyone needing any kind of assistance.< /text>< date>

It was in December, when our Christmas Tree was lit and the fireplace was on when I realized, I don’t want to lose my home.  Disturbed and sad, I called my sister in Torrance, CA.  She referred me to the Financial Relief Law Center in Costa Mesa, CA and gave me their phone number.  They had helped her and she had great faith in them.  Who better than family to trust, right?  Without hesitation, I called right away.
The first to receive my phone call was Victor Ugarte, a case representative.  With patience and understanding, he listened to my situation and plea for help.  With all honesty he stated that if their group could help me they would and if they couldn’t he would tell me so.  He worked quickly to get back to me and tell me that there was still a chance.  Victor let me know how they could help me, what I needed to do, when I’ll be receiving a phone call, and also what to expect in the future.  He prepared me for what I was in for, I accepted.
I have been working with Mr. Ugarte and his team for 3 months now.  It has been the best experience I have had in dealing with my home. Everyone in this center has been so helpful and respectful to me.  I would highly recommend and refer Financial Relief Law Center to my family and friends.  In fact, I already have.< /review>< Date>

<review>Financial Relief Law Center is where you must go if you want things done promptly and accurately! I worked with Victor Ugarte and Amanda Billyard in particular and they are AWESOME. They are knowledgeable, thorough, understanding and humble. Talk about CLIENT CARE...Amanda Billyard stuck with me until she got results. With permission we called, and emailed  all odd hours of the day and night. That alone was VERY IMPRESSIVE!

I’m so grateful and I thank God for her.

I was facing a foreclosure on 10/15/18 with a family of (8) and the servicer 21st Mortgage Corp is a Giant Bully!!!  This is intense...where or who can you turn to? Well in my desperation, I filed a skeleton Chapter 13  in the morning of the sale date(10/15/18).  Trying to find a dedicated attorney who’d be willing to pick up where you left off, correct and continue the bankruptcy is nearly impossible. Thank God we were referred to Financial Relief Law Center and what a true RELIEF it was!!  Amanda Billyard provided top notch service.  I highly recommend AMANDA BILLYARD for legal services. She is OUTSTANDING!!<//review>< Time>

<text>From the onset, very pleasant, efficient, effective and honest.

I cannot tell you what a relief it was to have these fine young people pull us from the gaping maw of foreclosure.  They dealt with the regulators and got us a great rate to boot!

I would (and, in fact have) recommend them most highly...nothing beats success!

I hope I have th opportunity to recommen them again...they deserve it!

<Review>I had less than 48 hours to find relief for a family member. Two words: Victor Ugarte! Professional, Proficient and Extremely Personable!  The situation I presented FLC was bleak, at best. I was trying to figure out how to tell my loved one their home was going to be sold from under them. With unwavering confidence and smooth precision, Victor Ugarte & Rich Sturdevant moved methodically,  reassuring me every step of the way that  everything would be fine. They executed the seemingly impossible: halted the sale!  I highly recommend this skilled ensemble of GO-GETTERS to help with your financial and real estate woes!  Thank you!  Thank you! THANK YOU!!
By the way, Victor...your cape is showing!< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I want to say... What a great company Financial Relief Law Center is... after becoming disabled and fighting with BoA for 2 years to do a loan modification and getting no were. BoA transferred my loan to Rushmore Loan Service, leaving my credit score as above average.. Fighting with Rushmore for another year, slamming my credit score and them starting foreclosurer. A foreclosure date posted. I didn't know where or what to do... frantic now! I started looking for someone to represent me. I searched numerous web sites. I was actually contacted via email from Financal Relief Law Center. After talking to Victor on the phone with Financial Relief Law Center, he recommended that I check out BBB on them & their web site. I felt good about them and decided to go with them. I'm super glad I did, because they did everything they said they would do. They are the #1 team out there.

After 3+ years of fighter with these lenders & 4 foreclosure dates set... Financial Relief Law Center won my new Loan Modification for me, saving me 100's a month in money, heartache and stress my heart did NOT need... I personally want to Thank Victor, Marc and most importantly, Rhonda Minor, for saving my House, my Home, from Foreclosure......   :)

One Happy Customer!   Austin M. Carrino< /Review>

Had the good fortunes to work with this law firm. They did a marvelous job. Mr. Andy Warshaw studied our case, He and we knew that we are dealing with a tough case and a tough adversary, however we had to work hard and smart as we were right. He put several plans, A, B , and C with the objective to proof our innocence, avoid damage, but surprisingly also to minimize the legal expenses ( meaning his company billing to his client ). Having dealt with several lawyers in the past, I never met someone with such care and professionalism.

Because the attorney (Andy) and the client (Myself) believed in our case, the cooperation was excellent and we achieved proof of innocence, total avoidance of damage, and an unbelievable low cost.

I will recommend the Financial Relief Law Center APC to one and all without reservation. You will be truly in good hands.</Text>

The team was awesome at helping us resolve a commercial real estate lease agreement that we were trying to buy out of. Everyone we dealt with was extremely responsive and felt like they were on our side, even to the point of billing. Usually I feel like lawyers bill anything and everything. With these guys, I feel like I was underbilled for the time the lawyers put into this project. Great value.< /Text>

I would like to highly recommend bankruptcy attorney, Amanda Billyard and her law firm, Financial Relief Law Center.  I have just received my discharge letter from a very complicated and somewhat, high value bankruptcy.  I owe the extremely beneficial outcome and smooth sailing throughout, to Ms. Billyard.  Let me also give a big shout out to Victor Ugarte for all his help in coordinating the many moving pieces.  Like I said, it was an extremely complicated bankruptcy and Ms. Billyard used her steady hand and sound legal expertise to deliver this fantastic result.  I throughly recommend Ms. Billyard and her firm Legal Relief Law Center. 🏆 🏆 🏆 🙏 🙏

I had been putting off filing for bankruptcy for several years. However, the current pandemic made it more difficult to make the money I needed to pay off my debt.  I called Financial Relief Law Center and Victor was very helpful in explaining everything about the process and very up front about how everything would go.  Amanda was also excellent in getting me through all of this.  I was dreading filing for bankruptcy, but they made this quick and painless.  I am eternally thankful to both of them and highly recommend Financial Relief Law Center to anyone who needs help getting out of bad financial situations.</Text>

To Financial Relief Law Center, APC- Thank you to Victor and Amanda for their great work in helping me to alleviate all my debts and start anew. After a few short months I was able to alleviate vehicle debts and credit card debt. Victor and Amanda were very personable and responsive to all questions and knew exactly how to handle the situation. I highly recommend them for anyone looking to file bankruptcy.</text>

<Text>This firm is the best!!! I can't even express my gratitude with this firm. I contacted the firm to assist me with my foreclosure process. Both Ronda and Victor they are amazing. Victor was my original point of contact. He assisted me through the initial intake process and answered all questions I had about my loan modification. Ronda was my second point of contact, she was my operations manager through my entire process. Ronda is very knowledgeable advised me of the pros and cons. She is always available and answered all my questions. She walk me through the entire process keeping me updated at all times. The entire team is very efficient and the entire process took less than 3 months for my approval.  I highly recommend this firm to all my family and friends and anyone who is in need of legal help. Thanks Claudia</Text>< gmap_id>

<Date>1608080546653</Date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Financial Relief Law Center was absolutely the best choice. I was looking for a way that could protect my assets when the debt relief is too slow to handle my financial burden then collection agencies & banks were chasing me with a civil case. So I googled about a debt relief law firm, Financial Relief Law Center appeared. I called up & spoke to Victor Ugarte, he’s the man who takes care of your business, walk you thru the process before he books you to a lawyer. He’s helpful, considerate, kind & compassionate. This law firm deals with what help they can do for you and won’t judge you about how you get yourself in such financial mess. As a person who made wrong financial choices like myself, you really need to be in a place where you feel welcome without judgment & prejudice. Ask help to people who really wants to help you get out of your mess & protect you against the pressure of the collection agency. My lawyer Andy Warshaw, who was tall, young & smart. He’s young but his his experience as a lawyer was outstanding. He was a beacon of hope at a time when my options were limited. Not only was he able to lay out options for a resolution to protect my assets, his calm & empathetic demeanor offered emotional succor when I filed for bankruptcy chapter 13. The thought of bankruptcy was scary but he explained it well and it was the best decision I made. I am eternally grateful for his service and I definitely recommend Financial Relief Law Center without reservation. You are in good hands.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1608162354349, 'text': 'Thank you very much for the time you spent writing this review and the very kind words.

FRLC literally does the rest.  Moreover, Amanda is always burning the midnight oil, following up out of hours and weekends if necessary.  Ensuring I was informed, up to date and never guessing.</Text>< Pics>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I am so happy that I chose Financial Relief Law Center to help me with filing bankruptcy ch. 7. They were not only professional, but kind, courteous and non judgmental. Victor was amazing at helping me with any questions that I had and making sure that I understood everything that was happening clearly. He is really easy to talk to and quick to respond via email, phone call, or text message. Filing bankruptcy was an intimidating thought to me, but after meeting with Amanda she guided me through all the steps and helped me to feel comfortable. It was such an easy process with the help of these two and I am so grateful to them. They worked with me on a payment plan building up to actually filing with the courts which really made this possible for me to do. Having Amanda by my side in court took away a lot of my fear and thankfully my debt was discharged in August 2019. If you are thinking of filing for bankruptcy give Financial Relief Law Center a call - you won't be disappointed!<//review>< Pics>

<response>None</response><user_name>xred< /user_name><Review>I have been trying to do a loan modification for almost two years with Chase. It was a horrible experience dealing with Chase directly. Chase was giving me a run around for so long and I was getting absolutely nowhere that I finally decided to get legal service’s help. I started looking for legal services and did a search on the Internet and saw that's what Financial Relief Law Center did. I gave them a call and have talked with Victor & Max and they told me about their service, what they do; and I did some research on them, talked with them actually several times and then I decided to use their services.
After that I have been working with Stacey, Angelica and Rhonda who did an amazing job getting all paperwork ready, initiating the process and negotiating terms with Chase. Special thanks to Ronda who spend a great deal with me and working with Chase for months and have never backed out. Ronda was constantly in contact with me updating me on the progress. Eventually the issue with Chase has been resolved with very positive outcome and all of this wouldn’t be possible without hard work that has been done by the Financial Relief Law Center team.
I would like to thank everyone in this highly professional and an amazing team who has made it happened!!!!!! Thank you Guys!!!! You have done a great Job!!!!

The closing of our business was stressful enough but we were blessed to have Andy and his team prepare our bankruptcy.

Andy has been very responsive and involved with every step. I shopped attorneys before choosing FRLC and the others seemed like car salesmen. Choosing Andy and his team was among the best professional choices I've made.

Our case was resolved exactly as they said it would.</Review>< Pictures>

I was looking for a law firm to represent me and I'm very glad I found financial relief law center,  from day 1 Victor reached out and explained everything and how the process works and what I needed to do, he explained via phone and email, he went over and beyond for me and I really appreciated it. As the process moved forward Amanda stepped in and also was very explanatory and helped me prepare for court, at the end I am very glad i chose this firm and i would recommend them to anyone who is contemplating bankruptcy.<//text>

< Review>
I received a letter in the mail from this company, which I was hesitate to call them. I'm not one to trust companies that send out letters. I'm not sure why I ended up calling them, but I'm happy I did. The first person I spoke to was Viktor. He was so helpful and polite on the phone. He gave me guidance, ever though I told him I wasn't sure if I was going to use their services.
In the end I did go through them and I'm so happy I did. They were so helpful and always there for me when I reached out. My loan mod. took almost two years to be completed, but I never once got worried...well that's not true, I did once, but they were there for me and reassured me it was going to be fine. The end results were amazing.
I highly recommend this company. They are trustworthy and will be on your side.<//Review>

My  husband and I are so pleased with the work Victor Ugarte did  for us.  He was on top of making sure we had all the information we needed to get our bankruptcy paperwork filed.

We  highly recommend  Financial Relief Law Center</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><username>Stephen Blaine</username><Review>I wanted to give a big shout out to Andy Warshaw of the Financial Relief Law Center. Andy helped me with a case a few years back and was outstanding from day one. Everything that was promised was delivered as such in a prompt and professional manner. A few weeks back I needed some additional services. Andy got back to me same day, remembered all the facts of my case, and jumped in to assist me immediately, even though it was over the holiday time period, which can be difficult to reach people. Great customer service backed by solid talent is a combination sometimes tough to find. If you want a solution to your situation from someone who cares and will act promptly to resolve your issues, Andy truly is your guy.< /Review>< Time>

Gosh... You may have never thought you'd be seeking to "file". Bankruptcy was a "daunting time" for me... It felt like as shroud of clouds was lingering in the upper regions of my mind. However, that quickly evaporated when Andy Warshaw came into the scene! Enabling a drastic shift in "mental & emotional climate". Clearing the fog, and providing a guiding light to finding a place of rest. finally... peace of mind! Thank you immensely, Andy Warshaw and Financial Relief Law Center, APC. Very Grateful. Specialized Professionals. Excellent Care.<//text>

Financial Relief help me with my loan mod. I was extremely reluctant on hiring these guys due to the horror stories I heard other people experienced with similar companies offering the same kind of services. These guys were extremely professional and always available to help me with all the ridiculous amount of paperwork the bank sent me. Financial Relief help me get through a really rough time in my life and thanks to them I get to keep my house. Max, Angelika and Rhonda you guys are the best.<//review>

I was referred by my wife who had utilized the Financial Relief Law Center several years ago and I was paired up with Andy Warshaw. What I didn't know at the time on how lucky I was for having Andy as my attorney. Most other attorneys were fairly dismissive of my situation but Andy fought for me and literally saved me over $100,000 on a severely complicated case.  Andy fought for me where others would have given up.

Bankruptcy Attorney's all have to charge the same amount so why give your money to some other attorney who will treat you like a number? From the first call with Victor to my many calls with Andy, I felt welcomed and reassured. As someone who has worked in the field of law for 10 years, I couldn't recommend Andy Warshaw and the people of Financial Relief Law Center Enough!!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

My experience with  Financial Relief Law Center has been outstanding. The circumstances that I was dealing with were emotionally very trying. The care and attention from Victor Ugarte and Ronda Miner has been exceptional. They have stayed a step ahead of the situation regarding a potential loss of my home. They have taken care of the details and clearly communicated the situation. I would highly recommend their services.

< Review>
I was facing a law suit in which I believed the only answer was to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  I was directed to Andrew Warshaw at the Financial Relief Law Center.  He was able to negotiate an agreement outside of court which saved me hundreds of thousands of dollars and prevented me from filing Chapter 11.  I am forever grateful and highly recommend Andrew and the FRLC team!</Review>

When I first started looking for someone to represent me for my home modification I searched numerous web sites. After talking on the phone with Financial Relief Law Center they recommended that I check out BBB on them and their web site. I felt good about them and decided to go with them I'am very glad I did because they did everything they said they would do they even had me take notes when they were talking about the modification phase. They are the #1 team out there.< /text>

<Review>We had tried 4 times to modify our home with our bank and was rejected all 4 times. We came across Financial Relief Law Center in the mail and decided to try it out. WOW!!! They were on the spot, returning calls, very thorough step by step, and very friendly. The time we started until we were accepted for a modification was around 4 months. Everything went smoothly and they fought for us to to end. I highly recommend this company. I still am in tears thinking that we get to stay in our home, when we were losing hope. Victor, Max, Angelika and Rhonda Thank you!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Grateful Thanks

Approximately 2 years ago, I was in the midst of a foreclosure and received a call from Victor Ugarte at Financial Relief Law Center. There was something about his caring voice and warm demeanor that made me feel I could trust him and his team. And now
I know my instincts were right! Thank you to Victor Ugarte, Claudia Arias and Jessica Griffith for helping me in a time of dire need. Financial Relief Law Center truly cares about helping people and are not trying to take advantage of people like so many other
agencies do when someone is in a foreclosure. I would highly recommend this firm to anyone needing any kind of assistance.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<text>I was ready to give up and let my house go.  It was in December, when our Christmas Tree was lit and the fireplace was on when I realized, I don’t want to lose my home.  Disturbed and sad, I called my sister in Torrance, CA.  She referred me to the Financial Relief Law Center in Costa Mesa, CA and gave me their phone number.  They had helped her and she had great faith in them.  Who better than family to trust, right?  Without hesitation, I called right away.
The first to receive my phone call was Victor Ugarte, a case representative.  With patience and understanding, he listened to my situation and plea for help.  With all honesty he stated that if their group could help me they would and if they couldn’t he would tell me so.  He worked quickly to get back to me and tell me that there was still a chance.  Victor let me know how they could help me, what I needed to do, when I’ll be receiving a phone call, and also what to expect in the future.  He prepared me for what I was in for, I accepted.
I have been working with Mr. Ugarte and his team for 3 months now.  It has been the best experience I have had in dealing with my home. Everyone in this center has been so helpful and respectful to me.  I would highly recommend and refer Financial Relief Law Center to my family and friends.  In fact, I already have.</text>< username>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Financial Relief Law Center is where you must go if you want things done promptly and accurately! I worked with Victor Ugarte and Amanda Billyard in particular and they are AWESOME. They are knowledgeable, thorough, understanding and humble. Talk about CLIENT CARE...Amanda Billyard stuck with me until she got results. With permission we called, and emailed  all odd hours of the day and night. That alone was VERY IMPRESSIVE!

I’m so grateful and I thank God for her.

I was facing a foreclosure on 10/15/18 with a family of (8) and the servicer 21st Mortgage Corp is a Giant Bully!!!  This is intense...where or who can you turn to? Well in my desperation, I filed a skeleton Chapter 13  in the morning of the sale date(10/15/18).  Trying to find a dedicated attorney who’d be willing to pick up where you left off, correct and continue the bankruptcy is nearly impossible. Thank God we were referred to Financial Relief Law Center and what a true RELIEF it was!!  Amanda Billyard provided top notch service.  I highly recommend AMANDA BILLYARD for legal services. She is OUTSTANDING!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

From the onset, very pleasant, efficient, effective and honest.

I cannot tell you what a relief it was to have these fine young people pull us from the gaping maw of foreclosure.  They dealt with the regulators and got us a great rate to boot!

I would (and, in fact have) recommend them most highly...nothing beats success!

I hope I have th opportunity to recommen them again...they deserve it!

I had less than 48 hours to find relief for a family member. Two words: Victor Ugarte! Professional, Proficient and Extremely Personable!  The situation I presented FLC was bleak, at best. I was trying to figure out how to tell my loved one their home was going to be sold from under them. With unwavering confidence and smooth precision, Victor Ugarte & Rich Sturdevant moved methodically,  reassuring me every step of the way that  everything would be fine. They executed the seemingly impossible: halted the sale!  I highly recommend this skilled ensemble of GO-GETTERS to help with your financial and real estate woes!  Thank you!  Thank you! THANK YOU!!
By the way, Victor...your cape is showing!< /review>

I want to say... What a great company Financial Relief Law Center is... after becoming disabled and fighting with BoA for 2 years to do a loan modification and getting no were. BoA transferred my loan to Rushmore Loan Service, leaving my credit score as above average.. Fighting with Rushmore for another year, slamming my credit score and them starting foreclosurer. A foreclosure date posted. I didn't know where or what to do... frantic now! I started looking for someone to represent me. I searched numerous web sites. I was actually contacted via email from Financal Relief Law Center. After talking to Victor on the phone with Financial Relief Law Center, he recommended that I check out BBB on them & their web site. I felt good about them and decided to go with them. I'm super glad I did, because they did everything they said they would do. They are the #1 team out there.

After 3+ years of fighter with these lenders & 4 foreclosure dates set... Financial Relief Law Center won my new Loan Modification for me, saving me 100's a month in money, heartache and stress my heart did NOT need... I personally want to Thank Victor, Marc and most importantly, Rhonda Minor, for saving my House, my Home, from Foreclosure......   :)

One Happy Customer!   Austin M. Carrino< /Review>

<Text>DO NOT SIGN UP YOU KIDS TO DO ANY SPORTS HERE! They hire unqualified referees, the staff doesn't know 3 points from 2 points
Then when you voice your opinion they are rude. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO EXCEL AND GROW IN SPORTS DO NOT SIGN THEM UP. Dont waste your money, dont waste your time.<//Text>< pics>

<text>The Gonzales Center has offered many different programs and services throughout the years including: classes like karate, gymnastics, swimming, and folklorico; also programs such as Day Camp, Teen Center, Senior Center, and various sports. I understand that many people who walk into the center become quite unhappy when they find out that they cannot use the restroom for lack of being a "Program Participant", however, this is their policy and it has been put into place to protect all Staff Members and Program Participants (especially for the many minors there). So, please keep this in mind when visiting, and I'm sure you'll have a pleasant experience at the GCC :)</text></record></dataset><record>

Nice facility for a recreational swim. Splash pad is pretty small and children get over it fast does not have a kiddie pool which would be great and for the big pool they do not provide life jackets if kids do not have one. They also charge infants less than y months and adults even if ur not getting wet which is a downer.<//Text>

I went in to grab a Colton Connection packet and inquire if I could still sign my kids up for a class. Went to use the restroom and they wouldn't let me use it unless I was there to pick up my kids from a class. You treat all your prospective customers that way? I'll go elsewhere.< /Text>

My kids are involved in many of the school aged programs & day camps.  Staff is amazing!  We are not happy with some of the city's budget cuts which had negatively reflected on the kids activities.  This year the prices went up; but there are way less activities being offered.< /review>

I have called the center 6 times on a Monday afternoon at 4:20 pm and I cannot get through.  This is ridiculous!  There are numbers on the automated answer message asking to leave a message on a different call.  This is a public facility where there are enough employees to get the phone. What is the problem?< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The place has a pool, gym and classes for children of self-defense, but you have to be careful because there are always homeless people there in the park and around the table area.

El lugar tiene alberca, gym y clases para niños de defensa personal, pero tienes que ir con cuidado porque siempre hay vagabundos allí atrás en el parque y por el área de las mesas.</Review>

<review>I wanted a particular set of wheels and tires. I searched everywhere, in other shops and online; however, none could beat the price listed at NFS. Nabeel and Sam were willing to negotiate and work within my budget.

Installation was free of charge, even wheel balancing. I noticed that I was having alignment issues due to a larger set of tires and they even fixed that free of charge. Within a week, I punctured my tire. I sent it straight to NFS and they patched it up... again... for free!

When I first came to the shop, I was hesitant because I had air suspension in my car. However, most, if not all, employees seem to run air. They gave me invaluable information about it. John even helped me roll my fenders and adjusted my ride height to perfection.

This is now my go to place. This past Winter, my tires needed a bit more air. Chris and Sulman had no issues inflating them back up and inspected them.<//review>< rate>

<Text>I called Nab, the day before and he fit me in the next day asap to get my lowering springs installed on my 2015 Mustang. They offered me a great price to get them installed almost a 50% lower price than any of the other places I had called around pinole, hercules & concord area. They know what they are doing and you can trust their work. They even called me in next week to just check up on the springs, thats some great customer service right there.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Sam and the rest of the NFS crew are truly awesome! I first visited this shop in 2017. I needed someone who has experience installing aftermarket suspension and other aesthetics upgrades for my car. I search around, and I couldn't find anybody who has enough experience to do the work. And if you're someone like me, I don't want anybody touching my car unless you know exactly what you're doing. So, I decided to give NFS a try and ever since I been a loyal customer. I bought wheels, all the tires for my car and wife's car from them. I would turn to them for help if I needed services for my older car like leaking oil, brakes and all other car issues big or small. Aside from experience, they have the friendliest and approachable staff. I think I haven't mentioned that they have the best price in town. I highly recommend this shop.< /Text>

A nice auto shop with an outstanding level of service and good prices. I got my tires changed and wheels aligned. It took less than 45min from parking at the shop to getting back in my car.
They were able to provide me with uncommon tire sizes overnight when most other places would take at least a week. Really impressed!< /Review>

Great place. Super friendly staff and great prices. I don’t understand how you can give this place one star. You might just be living a unhappy life. These guys are honest and they never forget a face. Thanks again NFS. One more thing, the old spot that’s been taken over....true rip offs. Sent my guy there and he’s a Toyota mechanic. Tried to fool him and he pretty much let them know that car had zero issues. Should have seen the look on their faces. Horrible people.</Review>

<Text>NSF Tires is the type of shop that is of the reputable, honest and trustworthy kind.  Their team of employees including the owner Frha are first class professionals.  I’ve been here multiple of times through the years and always satisfied with the Service.  I like their Snap Finance option 90 day same as cash if ya don’t want to charge to credit card or need payment options.  Currently upgrading tires on a new 2019 GMC Sierra 1500.<//Text>< user_name>

This store is the best one that I have found in the Sacramento area. It is clean and the employees are friendly. The employees seem to be into cards as well and super helpful. There is a computer and you search their stock pick what you want then they get it all together for you. Prices are fair market value and I haven't been happier since I found this store.< /review>

Be warned guys. This store doesn't open according to suggestion time. Give it half an hour or so before coming.

Edit: I decided to swung by today and I saw you(the owner) walk into the store at exactly 12pm. I thought you were opening up the store and so I waited no more than 10 minutes. Before leaving I left a comment here. I now then realize you don't open Mondays, shockingly. It's just miscommunication there. My apologies.< /Review>

<text>Small shop, Josh the owner is personable and knowledgeable of trading card games. Their inventory is small compared to other shops around town but they are also one of the newer shops and one of the only remaining shops in the area. They host competitive events and tournaments with typical buy-in's and prizes. They sell card accessories, and a small selection of gamer snacks. They do post inventory online but I'd call to confirm. They are big about following rules like being polite/courteous, minding your hygiene (which shouldn't have to be a rule but look at whom you're dealing with), and the big one trading and selling cards in the shop- do that elsewhere he is running a business not holding a commercial marketplace for cottage industry card sellers. I go here with friends when I'm in the area, not my main shop but I like going here to support card shop diversity. Worth checking out if you're in the area.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>I love this place. I truly feel they do a great job and run a super clean and organized shop. I travel for work and have visited many, many MTG shops and feel this shop is awesome. The owner is great and his selection is impressive.  This place is on my hit list whenever I am in Sacramento.  Go and check it out.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

1. This is literally a small shop
2. Minimum buying is required. Haven’t experienced this for the last 10 years playing mtg over countries
3. I searched for some cards I need in a modern esper control （to meet the minimum requirements). Unfortunately most of them are not available, and for those available it’s much higher than any online website (including shipping and all other costs, around 20%)
4. It’s not as competitive as some people described. I watched several matches and players made tons of mistakes (missing effects, play impossible color combinations , losing winning matches). But you’re not encouraged to pointing out since it’s “competitive”
5. Most people there are playing some self constructed deck for fun, but just one or two players are playing some perfectly constructed deck (Both the main and side are similar to the GP/MF one). It feels like one or two are ruining others

Positive comment: Players there are actually interesting and passionate about magic, which is nice.<//Review>

One of the most cleanest card shops I've been too. Other card shops that I've stopped at were not as clean and organized as this small shop. Card selections are great and well priced and even lower than most market price! Online store is updated frequently and made easy to order online which I do not see any of the other in town card shops do. Staff are super friendly, knowledgeable with all the cards and will start to remember you if you become a regular. Only complaint is that the shop should be bigger!</text>

<review>Come for the prices and selection, stay for the people.

CCS has done well to create an environment that eschews the typical grungy card shop experience with a neat and clean floor space.  The staff are friendly, engaging, and have a passion for the games they support.  Most importantly, CCS has created a vibrant community of passionate and genuine players from all walks of life. All things considered, the Shack has created one of the most positive gaming and community experiences I've had in my 20+ years of playing.

If you're looking for a place to call 'your' local game store, you've found it.</review><user>115430035390463039805< /user>< Rating>

The owner, Josh, was really knowledgeable about the rules and really helped us out. The player base there was really helpful throughout the games explaining things that i was unsure of. I had a blast.

His inventory of cards was good sized and i found everything i was loooking for there. I sold him a couple cards and was given a really good price for them and even better store credit.

The owner and his employees are very friendly and helpful.<//Text>< user_name>

I've known the staff and other of CCS for about a year. They've always been extremely helpful, professional, and abled individuals with expertise. The staff treat everyone equally, whether you are a first time buyer/visitor or a regular. They host weekly events that help people meet and find others with similar interests and passions! I will continue to support my local card shop for years to come.</text>

Great selection, great owners & workers, and good, friendly competition. The online store has a live inventory as well, so you can reserve your items and pick them up in-store if they are rare/high demand items.< /text>

This shop always has an event going on which is great for all card players. I recently went to their MTG prerelease tournament and everyone in the tourney ended up leaving with an extra booster pack! Their prices are pretty standard but they sell boosters for only $3. And $99 for a booster box is insanely good. Plus they offer more money on sales for store credit AND offer a rewards program!

No reason to not check this place out if you are looking for individual Magic, Pokemon, or Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. The owner Josh is really knowledgable about the cards and the rules for each game. Lastly, they have their entire inventory and buy list on their website which makes it easy to find the cards I need and know if he is buying the cards I have. Really well organized.</text>

<text>This place was built in the 1950's & it looks like renovations haven't happened since the 70's. You will see plenty of broken fences, music boxes & closed off play spaces (Robinson Caruso's play area, the Japanese tea garden). I would give this place 3 stars, my son would give it a 5 so to round out our score it is a 4.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>I absolutely LOVE chewy. I’m 24 and had such a fun experience meeting him! I can somewhat do the Chewbacca noise, so when I tried to do it, and choked, it was hilarious because then chewy tried teaching me how to do it better. Didn’t have to wait in line at all to meet him!

<Text>Star wars Launch Bay is an area for fans to see various displays and models strictly related to Star Wars. There is a merchandise area and plenty of art pieces to buy. Also inside this area are two character meet and greets and I believe the characters change. Definitely a nice place to walk through. (Path of the Jedi, is not inside this area, it is located next to space mountain)</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1feLLg7OCdmoQmKTGI-x5zHUi_D8q3VUv9A-L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwJQVB2_HAcXsy1EVgeBC4ZDrqsBLlUK9rvnfe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5vNDj8ZFKppqu4vzXsTDlRoL9gETm3e5yo5Cj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM74TgOWKxDo_bK1RQqwaj0p6Wr2eKsVkzImrTe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I have photos of my kids (now in their 40s) dressed as fairies, Indians, and maybe a gypsy or two. Playing about on the pirate ship at Fairyland. Holding hands with their grandmother in front of the Old Lady's shoe. No one in that simpler age thought fairies, indians, old ladies *or* gypsies were off-limits. ("PC" had yet to be invented.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I would give zero star if I could.  We got the 8am to 11am reservation.  Even though this place has a few activities you could do, but I realized that you can only pick one thing to do and that's all since when you are done, all the other activities will be fully booked or ran out of supply.</Review>

<Text>Loved meeting Chewie and Vader with my 7 year old nephew. Ok..as a huge Star Wars fan I was just as excited as he was!  Disney did a great job with this attraction. I just wish it was affordable for the average family to go to Disneyland just like the good old days when I was a kid.<//Text>< Pictures>

My little brother and I thought it was a ride. It’s just a museum. You get to take a picture/interact with Darth Vader and Chewie, but lines build up fast. There’s also a short video you can watch behind the production of Star Wars. There’s also more info on the vehicles, armor, etc on display. The canvas drawings were really cool. There’s also lego star wars video games to play.</text>

<review>I love Star Wars Launch Bay. This area is inside with ac to cool off from the heat. Lots to see and do in here. They have the model of the new Star Wars Land that’s being built right now: Galaxy’s Edge. You can meet Chewy, Darth Vader, and many more Star Wars characters to meet. (They even have a special VIP one for those having a Star Wars credit card).  There are video games, legos, movies and many more things to do. There is a lot to do in here there are two levels!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<review>We went to take photos with Vader. We had a pose we wanted to do, and the photographer just stared at us without taking a photo. Then waited for us to do the lame standing and this is Vader pose. Was going to buy the max pass for the day just for this shot but nah, it was ruined. Hate your jobs another day, we pay to have fun.<//review>< UserId.>

I was the left main pilot and got motion sickness and stressed out during this ride. Then realized too that I had thrown my neck out on my right side. We got out of the ride though without crashing the plane and we only had 25% damage. It was not worth the wait.<//Text>

Seeing the props and models from Star Wars was amazing enough. But being able to get a big hug from Chewbacca was, is, and will be one of the highlights of my life. Manly tears were shed, and it is one of the truest time where Disney magic took me back to my childhood.. Wait times to meet Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, Rey, and Chewie were not bad at all.< /Review>

Preview center for the upcoming Star Wars Land combined with a gift shop and a display of the art of Star Wars!  it's a nice Retreat from the midday heat of Anaheim. Plenty of bench spaces and fully wheelchair accessible. There is a full-scale representation of what the new Star Wars land will look like that you can check out. They have a video presentation that talks about how they came to the design they did. This one is somewhat hidden. Make sure you get a look at it because it's well worth walking through!  #LetsGuide #10SecondsOf #Video<//Text>

First of all, I must say, Star Wars Launch Bay is a complete disaster.  Nothing to do but meet two characters in 30 minute lines and look at very boring props (not used in the movies) and one gift shop. Worst thing that has happened to Disneyland (next to Star Wars Land).  Put the Carousel of Progress back in there.

Star Wars Land, believe me, will be a flash in the pan.  It will not be very successful.  Trust me.

Please don't listen to these people that promote this Launch Bay.  They are all part of the group thinking of Star Wars.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>If you are a Star Wars fan then this spot is a must visit on your Disneyland trip. There's a ton of memorabilia to see, from scaled down models of different vehicles,  to life size costumes of some of your favorite characters.
They have meet and greets with Chewbaca, Darth Vader,  and Kylo Ren. On our visit there was a small wait time depending on who you wanted to see. Chewie had the longest wait, cuz who wouldn't want to see that giant furball.
There was a small interactive gaming area where you could play some Star Wars themed games like lego Star Wars or the Star Wars Angry Birds.
It was cool seeing the full sized costumes. For an easy $3000 you could take home a nice Darth Vader outfit complete with helmet and all. I personally liked the storm troopers.
So if you get a chance,  swing by while you are in Tomorrowland.</Review>< pics>

I wanted to give this place a 5 because of how dang happy it made me, but let me break it down for ya. I absolutely loved coming here. Not a shadow of a doubt in that. Seeing all these different set pieces from the films was great! There are divided areas for things. When I went on January 14th 2018, they had a musuem, a lego section, a shop, displays, a short film, and an area to meet scheduled characters. It was all so awesome! Now, you might be thinking, well if it was so awesome why did you give it a 4? I'd say because of the size! Starwars is such a huge deal to everyone, however the size of this museum is a TAD small.

TL;DR 》Despite all of this, I loved it. Perhaps one of my favorite places in Disney! If you like Starwars, I would recommend this. If you LOVE Starwars... well... WHY AREN'T YOU ALREADY THERE?!

(p.s I just found out about this "Starwars: Galaxy's Edge" theme park. I am so. so. excited.)

<Review>(Translated by Google) Models of starships, swords and characters.
Shop with clothes, swords and various gadgets all at absurd prices.

There is an area with tablet and console to play Lego Star Wars and files to do for a photo with some characters: at the moment there were Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, Rei and the legendary Chewbacca.

Cute but from Disney I was expecting something much more interactive.

Modelli di navi stellari, spade e personaggi.
Negozio con abiti, spade e gadget vari tutti a prezzi assurdi.

C'è un'area con tablet e console per giocare a Lego Star Wars e file da fare per una foto con alcuni personaggi: al momento c'erano Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, Rei e il mitico Chewbacca.

Carino ma da Disney mi aspettavo qualcosa di molto più interattivo.</Review>< pics>

<Text>The guy came and “fixed” our dryer and I put quotation marks on the fixed part because as he was leaving he said something along the lines that he thought it would break again because a part needed replacing and just like he said our supposedly fixed dryer broke and he had to come again. So far our dryer is working, after he came again and said he had to order a part and left our dryer dismantled and didn’t return for several days, so here’s knocking on wood that it stays working for a long time! I would recommend this place, unless you have a better place in which case I don’t and also drop the info below, because he did fix the dryer and while I would have wished he had ordered the part when he made the guess that we would need it rather than waiting till it finally broke, it did get fixed in the end so…<//Text><Rate>3<//Rate>< Date>

<text>MIGUEL WAS A GREAT GENTLEMAN. VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT HIS PROFESSION, AND WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL HE INFORMED ME OF EVERYTHING HE CHANGED AND WAS ALSO CONSIDERATE TO LET ME VACCUM OUT THE DRYER AS IT WAS A HAZARD TO HAVE AS MUCH BUILD UP AS IT HAD. MY MOM HAS A OLDER MODEL DRYER AND DOESN'T CARE FOR NEWER MODELS. I WILL DEFINITELY USE MIGUEL AGAIN FOR REPAIRS ON APPLIANCES FOR MY FAMILY WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE HIGH DESERT LONG AND APPRECIATE GREAT SERVICE. OH DID I MENTION HE GAVE ME A GREAT DEAL
THANKS AGAIN MIGUEL 👍</text>< pictures>

I hired Miguel to come over and analyze what was wrong with my washer.  Initially, he took off a part on the bottom of the machine.  However, when he tested it he found that it was okay. Then he took a look at the lid lock assembly.  He felt that was the real problem.  Unfortunately, he did not have an amp or volt meter to run diagnostics. Additionally, he began to complain that he could not breathe through his mask.  Yet, I had one on and we all had to deal with that issue and keep pressing forward. Next, he asked for an extension cord.  I had one and told him it was $2 bucks.  He wanted to cut off one end and use it to check electrical flow to the latch.  Fine, so simply hand over the $2 dollars, he never did.  Contraiwise, he immediately wanted his $35 dollars for the call.  Yes, I paid him in full. He wanted to order a new part and said he would call me to let me know if he had one in stock.  Never called.  He lift my machine in pieces. I had to put it back together for temporary use. I called the office to let them know not to return.  Cannot recommend.< /review>

Once he got here he stated it was impossible to pull dishwasher out. After I showed him how to do it and was helping him work ect. I can go on and on. Long story short he came I’ll equipped and no knowledge on how to fix. He should of said from the beginning that he either didn’t want to do it or didn’t know how instead of wasting my time !</Review>< pictures>

Problem with my oven (F30 Code) and tried contact with two other repair companies listed who, apparently, have more work than requires being courteous. Anna and Miguel both are extremely helpful and friendly, knew the right answers and Miguel had my oven going within 15 minutes after arriving. Highly recommended service, I will be calling them again!</Review>

Customer service was great.
Starting with Anna on the phone. She was very nice and helpful when asked questions. Set me up with an appointment for next day, then shortly called back due to someone rescheduling and they were able to fix my dryer same day.
I unfortunately didn't get the gentleman's name who fixed the dryer, but he was very friendly, quick, and efficient.
Definitely saved me Lots of money and stress.
Thanks guys 👍🏼</text>

Miguel was a very helpful technician and was able to resolve my dryer needs same day. I appreciated the communication between the dispatcher as well as they kept their schedule for same day service, and called 20 minutes prior to Miguel arrival. I will use  Hesperia Appliance Repair again in the future for my appliance needs.</Review>

The reason why I only gave it one star is because I feel extremely disappointed, I feel like i only gifted them my money because I already knew that they were the stove sparkers, I do not recommend them at all, the man said that he does not know how to remove a rusty screw he only ripped me off of my money at least he should have charged me half for only being there for a short while. I do not recommend them.</text>

The man came to my house and barely did anything he only looked at the stove from the outside and that was it. He told me that the screws on it were stuck and then charged me $29 for doing nothing. I do not recommend this.< /text>

Great service. When I did call they could not come out that day but I called mid day but they did come out the following day. They did replace my washer switch. Only took a few minutes.
I asked if they did work on air conditioner but they don't. They did refer someone. Which worked out great was way cheaper on both then I expected.
My grandmother washer went out two days after mine with the problem problem and she did use him and was happy with her service as well.< /Text>

The Technician that came to my house didn't know anything. I finally checked youtube and showed him how to disassemble it. He still could not get it apart. When I finally had had enough he couldn't even put it back together.   He didn't charge me and I think I got what I paid for.< /Text>

<Review>Horrible customer service. I tried to return an item but had no receipt. The girl was very rude and told me they couldn’t take it. Didn’t even try to offer me store credit. I took it to a different store down the street and they let me return it with no issues.<//Review>< pics>

I've been coming to this Meineke for over 10 years now. The service is prompt and courteous. Every time I walk in there I feel like they treat my car like it's a person ! They have great record keeping, and they give your car the attention it deserves. Jason, my main contact person there,  always goes above and beyond to help, and so does everyone else working there. The owner is also a very sweet guy, humble and helpful. He once gave me a ride to work when I had to leave my car there, and he didn't even mention  he was the owner. They are truly your friendly neighborhood car repair shop.< /Text>

I feel like I have a personal company for my car’s needs. They educate me, help me make good decisions about Maintenance, are fair with their prices, and make me feel like I’m a part of their family.  The owner even gave me a ride home and picked me up. Wow, I am so impressed, and grateful to have this company to rely on!!< /Review>

<Review>I have been getting oil changes for years from Meineke, but this time I needed a diagnosis for some throttle hesitation that was happening. It was great to get a link to view photos of the repairs and future repair work that may need addressing down the road.

The car was repaired quickly and priced fairly - I will continue to use them and recommend others to do the same.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1615394598128, 'text': "Thank you for the review, Mary!

we love this Meineke!!!! They are thorough, courteous, knowledgeable and HONEST. We took a vw golf to vw dealer and they told us car needed over $5000 worth of work. car wasn't worth much more than that. we were deflated but took it to Meineke for 2nd opinion. They had car 2 days and called us and said we have looked at everything and there is NOTHING wrong with it. I said OMG thank you how much do We owe you. and they looked at me surprised and said, um nothing? we didn't do anything there wasn't anything wrong. I said but what about your time. they told me they didn't feel right charging me when there wasn't anything wrong.
HIGHLY recommend them.</Text>

Do not use this place. Was once a customer but that was completely disregarded when I trusted their recommendation on replacing a part that cost over $700. 2 days after I picked it up, even returned back to the store after picking up as my truck didn’t feel right   And was told there were no issues n my transmission blew up. They simply did not care about our situation as the part they supplied was not faulty. All that mattered were the codes from the computer. The owner didn’t want to chat, even tho when you are on hold you are told the owners care...... He simply did care about my side of the situation and passed in through the manager to come and pick up my truck.
DONT USE!! Go somewhere that values their customers.< /review>

<date>1611930948861</date><Review>I was able to make an appointment after work to get my overdue oil change. They gave me a discount,  and finished in a timely fashion, rotating my tires for even wear too.  I was the last customer,  so they let me stay in th he warm lobby to wait.
The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was that it did not seem that they took the extra measures due to the Covid19 pandemic.  So i wiped my door and steering wheel with sanitizing wipes and drove home with my mask on and windows down to completely air it out.<//Review>< Name>

I made an appointment and I thought I made it for the day I went in. Turns out I actually made it for the following day. They went ahead and fit me in and they didn’t have to. They are always so wonderful, kind, professional and efficient when I take my car in. I work in customer service so I know how important it is to make sure your customer leaves happy. They don’t ever try and up sell me with pointless stuff like other auto locations I’ve taken my car to. Or do stuff to my car without my knowledge and try and make me pay for it. Trust me this happens and it’s so wrong, but the guys here don’t do that, I know I can trust them.  I’ve been going to the Ventura location since 2017 and have never had a problem. I will continue to take my car in for services here! If I could give ten stars I would! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</text>

Always use Meineke. They are reliable, fairly priced, and deliver our car on time. It’s hard to find a trustworthy mechanic but these guys are it. I wouldn’t go anywhere else.< /Text>

I needed my oil changed since we’re moving to Oregon. I must of gotten there at the perfect time... there was no waiting. They did my oils change, topped off the fluids and made sure my car was good to go for my 1400 mile trip. It was my first time to Meineke and I will definitely go there again!< /Text>

<text>The Meineke in Oxnard tried taking advantage of my daughter by trying to charge her $400 to replace her brake pads, no new rotors just pads then smeared oil on her airfilter and wanted to replace it when I just checked it 2 days before she took it into the Oxnard shop for an oil change. Ted is a scandalous little thief who takes advantage of women and older folks.I call this Meineke in Ventura and they said it would be $240 to replace the brake pads. Its nice to see that there is still an honest shop around. I will be giving this shop in Ventura all our business from now on.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Their online appointment system is useless as I reserved a time for an oil change online and received confirmation via text and email. When I showed up for my appointment they said it wasn’t in there system. They were able to get me in during the time of my appointment though.<//Text>

I didn’t appreciate that when I came to pick up my car it was left unlocked before I paid for the work being done. I told the representative that it was locked and he kind of gave me attitude and clicked it locked. Also the rest of the time while I was paying it was awkward silence and he didn’t even give me the details about my tires or my car diagnostics. Normally I have positive experiences but this guy was rude and I didn’t feel my business was appreciated. Normally the guys walk me through what they did if my tires were bad or anything like that or when I should get my tires aligned or any problems they might have noticed or if nothing was wrong they would tell me your cars in good shape and we look forward to seeing you next time. This was the first time I didn’t feel appreciated at the car place. I have been coming here for several years with all my many cars and I didn’t not appreciate the experience I had with the sales gentleman.< /Text>

<text>Most places you have this sense because your a female that you dont know what your talking about even when you do. Well this place doesn't make you feel bad because your simply a female.  They have NEVER done me wrong. They've taken care of my car from day 1 and when I was at less than 1500 miles now I'm at over 215k+ miles and they are just as kind and supportive. I'm so grateful for all the work they've helped me with over the years and recommended them no matter what!</text><time>1589390698596< /time>< gmap_id>

First time going to Meineke and I instantly noticed how professional and super friendly the staff was. They have good prices and can do anything from changing your windshield wipers to replacing your whole engine. Highly recommend Meineke in Ventura without a doubt!</Review>

I am always very happy with the services I receive here. I have never felt lied to or taken advantage of (being a girl and all, and not knowing a lot about cars). I am always treated so well here. I always recommend this spot to anyone asking where to take their car for service. Thank you guys for all that you do to keep us on the road.<//Text>

<text>I have been going to this Meineke for over 10 years nowand I never have to worry that they're going to be taking advantage of me because I am a woman. In fact when I had no job they give me very good discounts to help me out. The guys are like family and they are also caring. This past Friday Bill, the owner, picked up my car from my house so that they could work on it and I wouldn't have to go out. That was such a blessing for me. I would recommend this Meineke to anyone.<//text><gmap_id>0x80e852a861ee28f5:0x2252bfe032cc9d95<//gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating>< Resp>

I came in for a mandatory catalytic converter issue since my car wouldn't smog.  Frank was so helpful and understood that I had to do it. I brought with me a quote from another local shop.

They did their own diagnostics and found that I needed only half of what the other shop quoted. They saved me $1000.00!

They were on time, my car was clean and they want me to return to do one more check to be sure I will pass the smog test

They do everything. Complete car care. I'll be taking me cars there now for all service.<//text>

<review>Was seriously overdue for an oil change and a family suggested Meineke in Ventura. Was hesitant always been going to a dealership but there were NO appts. available at the time so I called Meineke.

Jason answered phone, was very polite and understood my urgency and said bring it in! I left my vehicle to Frank who was very polite and professional explaining what would be done since I was a new customer. I ran some errands and conveniently received a text that it was ready. As I came back in, I was met by Jason, gave me my keys, explained what was done and the amount was less then was expected..AMEN!! Thank you Meineke for the great service on my vehicle but most of all for the polite professional customer service that speaks for itself. As I got in my car, I was already referring this establishment to family & friends ~ Returning Customer FOR SURE!!😁👍< /review>< name>

<review>First off there excellent service started when I called to make an appointment. When I took my truck in they did my service in a timely manner and WERE STRAIGHT TO THE POINT! They didn't once try to " up sell " so to speak. In fact when I spoke to them on the phone I had originally wanted a tune up and oil change. Once in the shop they actually took me in a total other direction once seeing the truck didn't need a total tune up saving me money right away. No pressure to try and get me to do work on things that were in the "ok zone" so to speak. They did my oil and some other engine treatment that totally fixed the issue I was having. All in all they were honest and there staff was extremely knowledgeable.they Hispanic man working the office was amazing and extremely helpful and knowledgeable, I feel bad I can't remember his name but you will know who I'm talking about when you go in. He also had the mechanic Zach work on my truck who was very very experienced in Toyotas and sent my 250,000 mile 4 runner home running better then it had in yrs. My wife and I dont take our cars anywhere but meineke in ventura ca.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1601238032108, 'text': "Thank you for the wonderful review, Jason!

<text>11:30 appointment, arrived 11:25. Car taken to bay and parked outside until vehicle ahead finished. Left at 1:00. Surprised at amount of time; seemed like forever. Employees did a fine job. Car was as tidy or better than when I brought it in. Not sure if the amount of time is worth the discounted price (coupon of $20 discount). Satisfied, but not over the top.<//text>< rating>

< review>
I made an appointment for 4:30 on a Tuesday. I showed up a little after 4pm and they took me right in. They had me in their system from previous work on a different vehicle and it just took them a moment to get my plate and their system had all of this new vehicles details aside from some minor specifics about engine size. The staff at the front desk was welcoming and efficient. I walked down the street to handle some other business quickly and came right back. The car was basically already ready by about 4:45pm and checkout/paying was easy and no pressure. They recommend some things I should have done coming up soon but again, no doom and gloom pressure tactics or anything. They sent me an inspection checklist via text and bam! It was all done and I was driving away before 5pm. Well done guys.</review>

I’ve been coming to this Meineke for two years and it is just the place I was looking for! This is the friendly, local, personable auto shop where the customers are repeatedly returning and are remembered. Lisa and Jason build relationships with us as humans with lives and auto needs. They are so knowledgeable and I always leave knowing more about my vehicle and what I really need to prepare for in future services and where my vehicle does not need extra maintenance. It is such a relief to be somewhere that feels like home! Thanks, guys!<//text>

<Time>1574016826752<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>I only take my vehicles to Meineke on Telephone because Jason and Ted are the most trustworthy mechanics I've ever worked with.  Take it from a guy that does a lot of his own automotive repairs to save money, these people are PROS!  Best part is that each of them take a little extra time to develop a relationship with you by listening and validating your situation....what other mechanic does this and saves you money?  If you are in a tough spot, they will help get you up and running again with compassion.  Don't waste your time or money going anywhere else, everyone deserves to have a neighborhood Mechanic like these guys!

11-17-19: wanted to add to my previous review...once again Meineke saves my life and wallet! Matthew and the team we’re amazing and willing to work with my budget. Even got me some reward points toward future free oil changes for both my vehicles!  Not to mention free headlight scratch removal of my foggy headlamps! I’ve said it before, don’t waste your time or money going anywhere else!!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Jason took care of me as soon as I walked in. Advised me on the best action to get my truck serviced.

When they found issues with my tires, Jason recommend a great set of tires and a responsible quote.

Thank you to the whole team working in taking care of my truck.< /Review><Time>1566840011365< /Time><user>114097961313873164981< /user><Rate>5<//Rate><Resp>{'time': 1566880704222, 'text': "It's wonderful to hear how satisfied you are with our team's efficient and reliable service, Jason!

<text>I had an appointment for an oil change, and was told it was going to take just a little longer since they were “backed up”. I asked how long it would take and they didn’t tell me and told me they’d call me when it was ready. I came back over an hour and a half later because it had been a while and they never called me.  I was fine with waiting a little, but would have liked a call like I was promised so I didn’t have to wait forever.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I've been coming here for years! Respectful shop! Not pushy for extra services, they do the work that's agreed, nothing more, nothing less.

They understand we're all on a budget, and spend the time to look for the most affordable prices for parts.

I send friends and family here often. The Owner Bill, Ted, Lisa, and Jason have always serviced my vehicles knowledgeably, and honestly. They know the value of customer service and repeat customers.

Best shop in the county!<//review>

I've always got great service so when I noticed I was leaking fluid and the transmission was acting funny, I took it to Meineke's. They diagnosed the problem and replaced a leaking transmission line. It was a labor intensive job which took over a day to repair.  Frank, the employee I interfaced with, did an excellent job of working with the warranty company and getting me a car rental (included in warranty). So far I have not noticed any problems with the transmission. If I do, Frank told me to bring it back and they will repair whatever is necessary and include it in the same warranty job so I wouldn't have to pay the deductible again. I would recommend them as a repair shop.

As a follow on, I did return the car because the transmission was not shifting well. They diagnosed and fixed the problem at no cost. Great job!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The guys at Ventura Meineke took great care of me. During the poring rain I was hydroplaning on the freeway on my way from San Diego to Santa Barbara. I got off in Ventura and looked up Meineke. They were able to put on two new front tires in about an hour. Then I was back on the road. Thank you Meineke of Ventura!! 🤗<//text>

Fair prices and good service. Ted and Lisa are very customer oriented, and the mechanics do good work. I have been bringing my cars here for several years. This time had a problem with vibration/road noise after rotating the tires, and they balanced the tires for free when I brought it back in. They also recommended additional service to fix the cause of the problem.< /Review>

Nothing but great words to say about this place, the most honest and passionate group of mechanics in all of Ventura. I have been coming here for years and every time the job gets done correctly, efficiently and with integrity. I've gotten my car serviced for oil, brakes, alignment and a simple rear view mirror fix. Super grateful to have them right around the corner from my place. Thank you guys for all of your hard work!</Text>

<Date>1599675630214<//Date><rating>4</rating><Review>This place always has great customer service. The only reason why I’m giving them a 4 stars was because I did an oil change and tire rotation you would think they would make sure the tires had the right air pressure. That was not done, other than that great experience. That was 3 months ago.

Update: I went in for my oil change they offered great service however hardly anyone had mask on including the two staff working the registers I didn’t like that at all.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1599753320629, 'text': "Thank you for the review, Angela.

< Review>
I've been taking my car to Meineke for about two years now. They have great customer service and they are honest in all of their dealings. I've never been upsold or told that I need something that was unnecessary or not due yet. I've worked with Lisa and Jason in the past and they're both really sincere people. While I maintaining your car is never something to look forward to, I do look forward to dealing with Meineke Ventura in the future.< /Review>

I drive from Camarillo for service here. The drive would be worth it just for the attitudes of ALL the employees. They all must get paid good or are allowed to drink at work.
Always get an honest assessment on the car and their prices are very fair. I've shopped them and never beat their price.
Easy walk to lots of shopping kills 2 birds.

They tend to get busy so take advantage of the appointment system. Ted and Jason are who you will deal with, 2 of the NICEST guys you will ever run into. They always take the time to explain everything and answer all the questions.
BTW- I have 5 cars so I speak from experience, they service them all.<//Text>

< review>
I have never had an issue with meineke until yesterday. Had an appt at 10. Dropped off at 945 left with kids was told only 2.5 hrs turned into 4 hours. I left and had to go back bc the alignment was off n spent another 2 hrs there. Which stuff happens BUT the tech doing my car had no respect for my car. He used his dirty oily gloves in my car. Ruining my steering wheel cover got my car all dirty. I had to ask them to put the air caps back on. I just felt after me spending so much money n had to go back n all I got was oh sorry then to find out after driving getting my hands dirty n had to throw out my steering wheel cover they should of had more respect for my things.</review>

My experience each and every time I need car service at Meineke Ventura is exceptional. I am treated with courtesy and professionalism from the moment I am greeted by their first employee.  The quality of service is outstanding and I praise their entire staff for job well done.  I highly recommend their service for any of your car needs.</text>

<Text>This place is the best, I can't even begin to tell you how many places I've been that are sloppy, underhanded, and and do shoddy work, this meineke is as professional and honest as I've seen in my 65 yrs of living. Excellent mechanics, top end equipment, and Lisa who runs the front office is very well versed in all areas of auto repair, pleasent, and .Looks to make sure the job is correct.

Not bad but you need to stay on top of what there doing other wise you come out of there doing more than what you need? Do a little homework before hand there no different than all the rest.</review>

Been here twice, first time was way above and beyond! The second time took over an hour to finish an inspection that took 10 mins last time, over all good reliable service. Between my 2 visits averaged to good experience.< /text>

These guys rock! i amhaving trouble with my car window. Which they quated me at 30 bucks less than the other cheaper places but 300 less than the guys i used to go to. The problem wasnt what we thought but, instead of saying oh well and adding to the bill we worked out a way to get it fixed at no extra cost cause the situation was so strange. I cant tell you what it means to me and my family to have people on your side like this. Its tax season and instead of trying to squeze money out of me cause i might have extra felt amazing. Especially when we have a child coming in july. And when it took a little longer than expexted they patched the problem real quick so i could pick my daughter up. Ted is the man responsable and i cant thank him enough. Plus while waiting they had a lot of customers and they seemed to always do the best by them helping anyway they could. Thanks guys< /Text>

{'time': 1539699377640, 'text': 'Susan,\nI’m the owner and I am truly sorry you had your engine get damaged. Unfortunately, you had your nephew install the used engine in your driveway and Meineke doesn’t warranty work that’s not done in our shop or parts purchased elsewhere. I have no idea what condition your used engine was in before your nephew installed it or your nephews mechanical ability that is required to install an engine. He apparently didn’t do the job properly and his mistake cause your engine to fail. When you brought it in after he completed the installation of the engine. Your request was to check for an exhaust leak and diagnose the check engine light. We fixed the exhaust leak and that cleared the codes. We never touched any of your nephews work and he apparently didn’t completely tighten one of the hoses and it popped off. Meineke isn’t responsible for another persons work. When you and I spoke, we talked about what happened and even though the situation is sad, I didn’t hang up on you. We take pride in doing the right thing all the time. I’m so sorry your vehicle continues to have issues but Meineke Car Care didn’t install the engine or hoses on your vehicle.'}<//response>

Wonderful people who CARE about clients without being exorbitant! The engine on my 2010 Impala has a strange subtle hiccup where the RPM meter fluttered now and then. They kept after it (the last session for free) and it appears gone! The owner, Bill Edwards, and his manager, Jason Turner gave me personal attention – plus all of their staff.
Try it. You’ll like it!< /Review>< Pictures>

Just stopped in today to see if Meineke could repair my stuck fuel door. The guy working the floor immediately offered to come out to the parking lot and take a look. He spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to affix a spring component that would work so that I could avoid the hassle and cost of going through the lexus dealership. He rigged something with an old spring that did the job. I offered to pay, but he just said, "Happy holidays."

I didn't catch his name, but he was working the floor around 11am 12/19/14. If I need any minor work, I will come back to this spot because of this guy. Owner or manager should give him some props!<//text>

And Ventura Meineke they've managed to do this with a wonderful personal touch. They make me feel like family from the time I enter the door till the time I leave the establishment. Ted usually is the first personel that greets me and I completely trust him with my car. He seems to actually care and never tries to over-sell products which is quite refreshing in this day of the "take advantage of the customer" age. Ventura Meineke is a friend.< /text>< Time>

<Review>SAVE YOUR CAR! DON"T GO HERE!!!! POOR SERVICE! POOR OWNER!! TERRIBLE BBB PROFILE/STANDING!

I went to Meineke in Ventura (4519 telephone rd) for a standard oil change on 4/29/2014 with 178,026 miles. After driving my vehicle for a couple of months (10/16/2014 with 182,826 miles on odometer: 4 800 miles since my last oil change) I noticed my car lossing power. Immediately, I begin to try to get off the freeway to address the issue but my engine began to knock, shut down and I threw it into neutral and coasted off the freeway. I was able to get a mechanic to look at it and was informed that I did not have an oil filter. (as my oil filter fell off) The mechanic said, that the oil filter should not come off under any conditions and that it fell off likely due to poor installation (striped my filter and car ) and that I should reach out to the company that last did my oil change. I reached out to Bill Edwards (owner of ventura Meineke) and wanted to find a resolution. However, he would not stand behind his work and offered poor excuse for his work and ultimately telling me I can not prove it so it was not his problem. I reached out to the Bureua of Automotive Repair and the Better Business Bureau to no avail; short of small claims I do not have any recourse. I would not recommend this place at all. His poor work destroyed my car! Go at your own risk! Also, look at his BBB profile he has been writen up by multiple people in the last couple of months. Save your car dont go to this place!<//Review>< Pics>
