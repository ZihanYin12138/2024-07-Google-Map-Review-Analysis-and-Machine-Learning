<text>As a first timer, I was impressed by the level of knowledge and patience Lola had during my consultation. She made me comfortable by explaining everything in detail and suggesting I start at the minimum levels of Botox. There was no high pressure sales tactics. I will definitely be a returning customer!< /text></record>

<Review>I have seen Lola multiple times now and I absolutely love her. Not only is she the sweetest doctor ever, but she is super knowledgeable and has don’t the courtesy of passing on some of her knowledge and reasonings to me! I have gotten Botox from her and am schedule to get my lip fillers done within the next week. The spa is clean and kept looking nice! The front desk staff is also pleasant. I recommend coming here for all your needs! They also have a Groupon for 20 units of Botox for first time customers!<//Review><gmapID>0x80dbf975a9099cc3:0x81afae1548553cb5< /gmapID>< name>

Have seen the amazing Lola three times now for IPL's.
Although I had had prior IPL procedures done, I never really got the results I was looking for until seeing Lola.
I can not recommend DermaFashion, and specifically Lola, highly enough.
All my expectations have been exceeded!
I will be back!< /Text>

<Text>This was a wonderful “spa” Treatment for me! Actually I have had 2 Botox treatment’s with Heather so far. The atmosphere is soothing, decor is stunning, treatment’s done were relaxing & completely pain free. I love Heather’s expertise! She listened carefully to my wishes & concerns. She suggested trying a “lip flip” on me & I LOVE IT! Look no further, they even accept Care Credit & apply Brilliant Distinction points! LOVE GOING HERE! Getting lip filler done next week here & can hardly wait!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf975a9099cc3:0x81afae1548553cb5</gmap_id></record>

I don’t recommend this place at all for Botox! It’s a SCAM! They are mixing the botox with  other solutions to cut the cost! They are using multiple syringes! Why? I don’t trust this place! Instead I recommend Riviera Spa! They are getting the botox front of you and putting it on a syringe then giving you the treatment!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I came in here 6 months ago and I had a wonderful experience but didn’t want to actually review it, until I’d “reviewed” my treatment.  I got Botox for the very first time and I came here, as my friend Tanya referred me.  I was extremely nervous but Christina made me feel calm and was gentle and walked/talked me through what she was doing.
So I lived through that treatment which was done in 2 sessions, with 2 weeks in between.  At about 5 weeks is when it really looked it’s best.  It looked great before but I remember this point.  It’s stayed fantastic and yeah a few lines have come back but nothing serious.  So I’m headed back to get round two, 6 months later.  I’m so pleased with the results from last time, I’m really excited it’s time to come back!
Spa is very clean, sanitary and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I went to the Derma Fashion Med Spa to see about a problem area around my neck (loose skin). I was very happy to learn that a non-surgical procedure (laser Titan and Genesis) would be helpful to tighten the skin around that area. I found the facility was very nice and welcoming and the staff was very professional and welcoming!<//Review>

I have worked with the Health Department. I have been in the aesthetics industry for 15 years doing Permanent makeup and trained in Micro needling. I’ve been a medical researcher. This place is full of bs starting with their consent forms. Interior is gorgeous. Don’t fall for the added services.</text>

Staff is friendly and so helpful. Lola did my injections and she is amazing. I needed a little touch up after a week and she didn’t charge extra for it. I found my new med spa!</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Wonderful experiences here so far. I first heard of them through Groupon and after much research and recommendation from friends, I decided to go. Their regular prices are pretty fair. Janet, the technician I've been seeing is really sweet and kind and made me feel at ease. She explained the entire procedure and answered any questions I had. Seeing results after two sessions already!< /Text>< pictures>

Chelsea is still amazing. She listens to me and knows exactly what to do. I don't appreciate it when nurses try and up sell me with more because I want to look natural. Chelsea will not do this. I highly recommend her</Text>

I’ve been coming here for more than 5 years. After being displeased by competing Med spa’s, I decided to give this place a shot. I introduced my sister and my good friend to get hydrofacials , and they loved them! I come here for Botox and fillers. I have crows feet and wrinkles above my lips and laugh lines. I love everyone that works here. Chelsea has worked here for a while and I always love her input. Really honest and straightforward with all procedures . I’ll see you soon for the Juvederm XC !< /Review>

<time>1563128694914</time><rate>1</rate><review>I had an appointment on July 8th at 10AM. I receive a call that my nurse is having car problems and will be late. My appointment was changed to 10:45AM. I understand completely. Stuff happens. But that day I got pink eye from their goggles. I ended up having to miss a whole week of work and on Thursday I gave them a call to let them know what happened. Total denial. Saying that I have been there multiple times and that I have never had a problem there before. Like no duh. I felt disrespected because the woman on the phone couldn't even acknowledge the fact that they messed up. I literally took a nap after that appointment and woke up with pink eye. I've been there plenty of times with no problems but this really showed their true colors.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1565655923301, 'text': 'Hello Gabriella, I apologize on behalf of the worker who spoke with you and the clinic. We are now under new ownership and management and have new staff.

Thank you for being very understanding regarding change of appointment and we look forward to hearing from you in the future as well to leaving you feeling very cared for.

<Review>I have received services at DermaFashion several times now and I am completely satisfied!  The staff is professional and experienced and the environment is very clean and modern. They offer Groupon deals from time to time and also on their website. I have had similar services at other med spas that are less expensive but what I have truly learned is that the skill of the practitioner is well worth paying just a little bit more for.  It is not a benefit to pay less elsewhere when you don't like the results!  You can have full confidence that you'll get top notch professionals at Dermafashion!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<username>Melissa Lunt< /username><review>I have gone to Chelsea twice now for Botox. First on Groupon and now I’m hooked. I am 37 and needed 25 units on my forehead. It has made such a difference! The outside of the place is in a strip mall and not outstanding but once you walk inside you feel at ease. Very clean and high end looking. My mom is a nurse and came with me with lots of questions and felt totally comfortable with the nurse. You will not be disappointed!</review></record></dataset><record>

I'm always greeted with a friendly face when I walk into Derma Fashion Spa. The services have always been top notch as are the providers - Chelsea & Ziba are wonderful! The spa is clean and has a modern vibe. I also have been very happy with the products Derma Fashion has on hand and am thrilled this spa is close to my home so I don't have to battle the downtown or coastal traffic.</Review>

I had my first microneedling appointment and was very impressed with the nurse that preformed it. She explained everything and answered all my questions before it began. There was minimal redness after which I was surprised by since I have very sensitive skin. I will definitely be back!< /Review>

<Review>I went to this place three separate times. I received botox there and initially I thought that because there was no bleeding, injection lines, or puffiness (as I had this previously done by a certified doctor and with him it actually worked for four months unlike here where it’s been two weeks and it’s already worn off) that must of been a good sign. However, within a week I had and still have an allergic reaction where the injections were. I was told by a nurse that because "it didn't happen between the 3-14-day window and wasn't near the injection site it couldn't be because of the botox". Interesting because the reaction DID happen within that time span and WAS near the injection sites. So weird. I received two hydra facials (they have a deal for two) because I was told it would help with acne and the reaction I was having. The first session I was then told it would possibly make it worse at first (would've been good to know prior to making the unrefundable appointment?) and it did make the acne worse, but did help with the allergic reaction temporarily. I called another esthetician near where I live and was told that hydrafacials are not always what is best for acne, especially open sores. I've never tried hydra facials before, but I was able to find a new esthetician that can individualize my facials that Im hoping will be more informative than here.  The nurse did not give any advice or information on how to handle acne in this context (not from here). My new esthetician also said they have only doctors (not nurses) doing botox, and its the same price they offer here. I am pretty disappointed that I've spent over 600 on less than moderate services. I would not recommend this place, despite how beautiful and warm it seems and looks. If the owner is reading this, I really hope that you either train your nurses to have more information for a range of varying clientele or just don't accept clients you don't know how to treat. If you are using bunk botox, well then, I pray you stop - its unethical. I don't see why else I'd have a reaction when I've never had one before, but if its for another reason - try to figure out what happened. Thanks!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Terrible service!! SCAM! I requested to see the botox bottle that will be used for my service. They rejected to show it. I asked them if they are hiding something. They showed me the fridge that contains the botox bottles. However fridge was also full  of containers that has no labels. I asked if I can watch them filling the syringe with botox. They again rejected to show me the process which made me believe that they are mixing botox with other solutions. Since they are adding other solutions to botox they are reducing the cost to their company. NEVER GO THERE!!! We are spending hundreds of dollars and we have a right to see what we buy.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>This place is  the worst you can choose, looks like they inject water 👎 my experience was really really bad.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1565645757721, 'text': 'Hello Anahita, you came one time into our clinic 3 months ago and we happily attended you and honored you our Groupon. We haven\'t heard from you since until now when you booked your second appointment due to you purchasing a second Groupon which we kindly said that in the fine print is for New Customers Only and thus you were a non-candidate and could receive a full refund but could continue with the already booked appointment for our Tues/Thurs Special. The Groupon is allowed to be purchased again after the first time but only as a gift for someone else. We explained this to you over the phone. Now, regarding your comment on our injectibles, our RN\'s open every vial directly from the box and everything is being monitored in our cameras 24 hours 7 days a week, thus, it would be illegal and unethical to open and inject another product onto our customers other than the product itself. In this clinic all our clients are allowed to solicit to see the product being opened from the box and see how much product will be used. I do want to say if your experience was as you say, "really really bad," please let us know the earliest possible to see how we could make it better and second, when you booked your second appointment we did not hear from you that you were unhappy with anything the first time you were here. We are always looking to provide the best experience for our customers and prioritize our customers opinions. Thank you for you review.'}<//Response><GmapID>0x80dbf975a9099cc3:0x81afae1548553cb5</GmapID></record>

Amazing service, my studio is always is a mess. It was always overwhelming especially the laundry that needed to be folded. I called Emaids  and they gave me super reasonable prices. I recommend emaids to anyone< /Review>

<review>I just wanted to say that I've continued to use Maid Just Right now for the last year and have been very pleased with the service. I had another cleaning this week from Mara, Rhaissa, Sebastiao, and they did an amazing job. I'll definitely request them in the future!<//review><user_name>Karl Lowe</user_name>< time>

<review>Well executed cleaning service. With the addition of 2 new puppies in our household, things have gotten overwhelmingly busy and it's tougher to accurately manager our schedule.

So we've been using Maid Just Right for house cleaning purposes until we adjust to our new schedule. They always do such a fantastic job and have affordable cleaning rates!< /review><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

I have been using Maid Just Right for several months now and felt compelled to leave a review based on accumulated individual experiences. Based on my experiences with this maid service, I can conclude that they are more than capable of executing quality cleaning services for anyone who is in the market for a professionally executed service. I highly recommend them for your cleaning needs because they are thorough regardless of the situation.</Review>

It’s such a blessing to find this company when I did. They are completely competent and personable during each cleaning. They always leave the house looking and smelling divine when they’re finished with cleaning it. I can’t thank them enough for a job well done on each cleaning service performed. I will keep using Maid Just Right long term</review>

I hired Maid Just Right for maid cleaning services and was not disappointed in their level of customer service and quality cleaning capabilities. I have tried several other maid services in San Diego, but ultimately they fell short of my expectations and didn’t fulfill the cleaning requirements to the standards I was hoping for. I can wholeheartedly recommend Maid Just Right for your cleaning needs because they go all out and don’t cut corners.<//text>

My friend recommended Maid Just Right cleaning service to me, I decided to give them a try because she wouldn’t stop raving about how great their service is. I’m so impressed with what they’ve done. I agree with her, they are simply the best cleaning service in San Diego<//Review>

<review>This service was super easy to book online. I scheduled a next-day cleaning that was confirmed within minutes. They arrived early for my cleaning appointment and did an INCREDIBLE job deep cleaning my home. I couldn't be more pleased, and I look forward to having them back soon. Definitely recommend this service.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>5< /rating><userid>108596927076016166953<//userid><Name>Kathy Morrison</Name>< Gmap_id>

I requested a quote and got a prompt response for a reasonable price for a standard cleaning. The cleaner came out to my house on time and did a phenomenal job! She was friendly and respectful, and my house is sparkling. I've had a less than stellar cleaning experience with another company before, so I was a little nervous, but I'm so glad I gave them a chance.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>So we had them come to our condo and do a regular house cleaning, and they were AMAZING they were efficient, intuitive as to where things should go, cleaned everything well and in a timely manner, they were super professional and did an amazing job getting rid of all the dog hair we had around the house, since we have a huge black lab that sheds a ton. I was a little hesitant booking multiple cleanings but I def will stick to the 2x week. and the ease of ordering and scheduling online made it that much better</Review>< pics>

Was not on time, failed to call to let me know. When I called to inquire they said they charge me a fee to cancel. Only after I said I would report them to California Business Bureau the time changed. Do not recommend them. Poor customer service.< /Review>

I have used Maid Just Right twice in the past month for a basic cleaning of my apartment.  Each time the woman who cleaned spoke little English.  But that was no problem.  The cleaning was thorough and sparkling.  Also, I like the website feature that allows for extras.  I checked off cleaning the inside of the refrigerator on the recent cleaning.  Awesome.< /Review>

These maids are incredible! They clean every inch of your home very thoroughly and leave a good smelling atmosphere behind. When they leave, all the mess does too. I've never found anything that wasn't cleaned properly or efficiently.</text>

<review>They do cleaning the way it should be done. Professionally and meticulously wit nothing to go behind and check on. Spotless and shiny. The smell of a cleaned house is more satisfying than I can out into words. Maid Just Right is one of the only dependable cleaning companies I’ve hired in San Diego. I always look forward to when they leave their aroma behind. Some people really appreciate a signature dish. I really appreciate a signature cleaning lady! In this case ladies! :)<//review></record></dataset><record>

I've never hired a cleaning service before. But I did own a property preservation business. So I do know a lot about cleaning. This service was easy to order online. And they showed up on time, looking near and professional. Went above and beyond. I'm not sure I could ask for more. I'll be using them again.<//Text>

I was looking for a move out cleaning company. I wanted to insure I receive my deposit back from the leasing company from the home I was leaving. I found Maid Just Right online and based on their reviews I hired them. To be honest it was the most thorough move out clean I could've asked for. Literally every surface was touched and cleaned. Every drawer opened, the inside windows, the stove, refrigerator etc. I could go on and on. I got my entire deposit back from the leasing company because of it. I was thoroughly happy with my experience with Maid Just Right.<//Text>

I am very pleased with the house cleaning provided by Maid Just Right, and I will be recommending them to my friends and coworkers. The team was not only thorough, but very professional, and they treated my home as if it were their own. It never looked better, and I look forward to next month!</Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>Maybe a good service for routine cleaning but for a moving cleaning it's pretty mediocre. Before I go with the negatives let me hit the positives.
Stove, oven, refrigerator, and cabinets on the inside look brand new.
Now to the negatives.
Base boards they just smacked it with a broom. I can run my finger across base board and come up with alot of dust and grime. No effort there.
They just vacuum carpets which is fine they're getting replaced anyway.
Dust is every where and pretty obvious. The fans they hit with a broom and maybe quick swipe with a rag. Vents weren't  touched.
At the end I was asked to do the walk thru. I'm a kind man what was I to tell this nice lady get back to work?
300 for 3 bed 2 bath to get place back to closest to 100%. I think I'm at 65 maybe 70. Again I'm not saying this company is bad just sharing my close out cleaning experience.</Text><name>Darius</name>< rate>

{'time': 1561935324839, 'text': 'Hi Darius, first of all thank you for the feedback.\n\nYour main point of the review was "At the end I was asked to do the walk thru. I\'m a kind man what was I to tell this nice lady get back to work?".\n\nMove out/in cleans are always more difficult as you know the home much better than the cleaners sent to clean. That is why our cleaners are instructed to conduct walkthroughs after they believe they are finished.\n\nOur cleaners know that we offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee and want you to be completely satisfied with their work as it benefits them as well. When they receive positive feedback they receive bonuses on top of their regular pay ($25-30/hr).\n\nThe team we sent you has decades of cleaning experience. An honest and fair criticism of something that was missed would not phase them as they are professionals.\n\nUnfortunately, part of our 100% satisfaction guarantee is to send the same cleaning team back to re-clean anything that might\'ve been missed during their walkthrough. Again, this is something they all know and understand which is why it is important to be honest and upfront during a walkthrough.\n\nYou paid for a service and our cleaners conducted the walkthrough with the intention of making sure you were 100% satisfied with what you were paying for.\n\nAgain thank you for the feedback, however I believe this review is unfair to the cleaning team we sent to your home.\n\nSincerely,\nNathan'}</response>

< Review>
I made an appointment which was confirmed via email and text. My appointment was cancelled at 1 AM the night before they were supposed to be here at 10 AM - a really big problem as it was moving day for me and the last day of my lease. I tried to call and there was no answer and the voice mail is full and no response via text. I will never use this cleaning service again as they are unreliable and unresponsive and will be disputing the charge for services not received. Could not be more disappointed in the customer service, professionalism, and respect for their customers. :(

update 1: see Nathan tried to post a response to my review that is characteristically untrue as I did receive a confirmation email (see photos). The only call I received was at 8 am asking about parking options (again another sign of personal confirmation) and again at6:12 pm (not 4:35 pm as Nathan claims). I missed this one call because I was moving and called Nathan back before 7:45 pm (they close at 8 pm) and texted as soon as I saw to explain the paramount importance of having someone come today as originally booked. Nathan did not respond until past midnight and responded there was nothing that could be done and teams would be here Monday. Since I called and texted Nathan to explain and ask for help, Nathan has done nothing but explain away his mistakes and has refused to even give a meaningful apology about this service experience. I had to respectfully ask Nathan not to contact me anymore and that his lack of service, accountability, and, at this point, blatantly lying in a public review could not be more disappointing. The most unprofessional experience I have had in years.

Update 2: Since I posted my response to Nathan’s inaccurate description of what happened Nathan has taken down his post. Still no accountability...<//Review>

{'time': 1568581034033, 'text': 'Hi Jasmine,\n\nWe reached out to you at 4:35pm, the day you booked your cleaning appointment to let you know that we don’t have a cleaning team available. We didn’t receive a reply until 7:21pm which is an hour and twenty-one minutes after we were already closed. That is most likely why you were unable to reach us as our phones are turned off after 6pm.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience but I personally attempted to call you and did not receive an answer and sent you text messages that weren’t answered until after hours. The confirmation email you received was simply a confirmation that the appointment was received; we send out manual confirmation emails after a cleaning team is assigned to your appointment which is when your appointment is officially confirmed.\n\nAgain I apologize for the misunderstanding and wish we were able to assist you with your cleaning.\n\nI’d like to also note that we do not charge your credit card until after the cleaning is completed. The automatic hold on your credit card has already been released.\n\nSincerely,\nNathan'}</resp>

Used them a few times for a rental property, but they proved to be unreliable. First the maid didn't show up for a scheduled appointment and I had to wait several hours for them to get someone there. Another time they sent a message last minute that they didn't have anyone available even though the appointment had been scheduled for weeks. They were satisfactory when they actually showed up, but I'll be finding a new company.<//text>

The experience with Maid Just Right was extremely satisfying that pushed me to write this appreciation. They took the huge pressure on me by letting us booked a last-minute move-out cleaning. I called on Tuesday and was able to arrange a cleaning for Wednesday morning. They have sent us two maids that arrived punctually and finished the cleaning within 4 hours, that quick with compromising the quality of the work. They managed to remove all the stains and made everything clean and fresh including the carpet, floors, bathrooms and windows. Thank you so much for your care. Exceptional!< /review>

I got a text message (They did not even bother with a phone call) the evening before Maid Just Right was scheduled to come to my home. Lots of family coming in town in the afternoon and no time to make other arrangments.<//text>
</record>
</dataset><record>
<time>1549825441650<//time><review>Some things not clear. I give them credit for having a nicely set up website with ease of creating an account and scheduling the cleaning service. I originally set up to have the service repeated every 4 weeks to ensure I got help once a month. I was contacted via text to confirm my appointment, which was fine. They couldn't  accommodate my original time request and asked if they could come earlier, I agreed and left work early to let them in. I invited them in and gave them the tour. At the end I was told there was too much clutter and they couldn't clean around it. I'll grant there was a LOT of clutter (hence my calling for help). They are a cleaning service, I thought what I needed was included. It was never communicated to me that this was not the case.  I have used a cleaning service a couple of other times and it's never been a problem.  I was told its in the Terms and Conditions somewhere. But ok, that's their policy so it's fine. So they had their boss give me a call and explain what should have been explained the first time when i booked, and then they left. Nothing was touched. So now, I've left work at half a day, my place still hasnt been cleaned, i have to seek out other assistance and on top of that I've been charged a $40 fee because they say I cancelled with less than 24 hours notice. Which by the way I guess is also in their Terms and Conditions. 😒 Just be upfront about your policies, that's all. If your house must be clean before they get there because all they do is wipe the counters and sweep and vacuum, they should be upfront about it.</review><gmap_id>0x80dbffe3e34051c7:0x4b813241f50dc0cc<//gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics><user_name>Tish E<//user_name><user_id>110007173711366939403<//user_id>< Resp>

< Review>
After looking for a house cleaning service, one of my friends recommended Maid Just Right. I shopped around for a quote but the major chains all seemed to require long term contracts which I didn’t want to get locked into. I gave them a shot and am glad I did. They arrived early, did a pre-walkthrough and asked me if there were any areas that needed specific attention, and finished up with a final walkthrough to make sure everything was to my satisfaction. I’ve tried a couple other services but based on this cleaning I’d say they’re one of the best house cleaning services in San Diego. If I don’t sign up for a recurring service I’ll definitely be coming back when I need a touch up!< /Review>

I made an appointment for the next day, a little over 24 hours in advance.  The website has you pick your time and put in your credit card.  Ok, cool, done right?  Only available times should come up on the website, but this is NOT THE CASE AT ALL.  I get an email that says "After confirming availability, we'll be contact you to finalize your booking."  This NEVER happened, I even called and left a message, no call back.  So I'm sitting around waiting for someone who might show up??  If you take someone's credit card, the transaction should be booked already!!  Not have potential customers waiting and wondering.<//Review>

Pros to cleaner:
- She did a good job overall. The bathroom and kitchen were exceptional. She cleaned all my dishes (didn't expect it in the service). I think I misspoke on what I wanted to the dispatcher, but the cleaner didn't really clean anything in my room.

Pros to company:
- Dispatcher/sales rep was kind. Website seems somewhat modern and up to date.

Cons to the cleaner:
- The floors had a dirty smear all over them. Like the water the person used was dirty, or the mop was. I'm not sure. To me, mopping has always been an inefficient way to "clean" floors.

Cons to the Company:
- Unprofessional setup. No uniform, giant shopping bag with random supplies falling out, low-grade supplies, none looked environmentally friendly.

- It is entirely too cliche that you have a lady of Mexican descent, that can hardly speak English to clean my apartment. I tried to use some Spanish to be accommodating, but how can I ask her questions if she can't speak English? Not degrading her knowledge, but I don't think she knew much beyond "Hello". With that, you are doomed to have poor customer service.  To me, the company should pay for English classes so she can learn and be more accomodating.

- I paid over $100 for this service... I genuinely hope that a large majority of it goes to the cleaning lady. If she gets paid minimum wage or close to it, for her arduous effort, I will not be using your service again. That would be so incredibly unfair. You make this lady use the lowest grade cleaning supplies--none of which are environmentally friendly--inhaling these terrible fumes, and I imagine the CEO reaping all the rewards. A lack of care for your employee is very unsettling to me.

Most of my dissatisfaction comes from my perception of the overall experience and how I perceive your company. My perception is this: You care very little about your employees by not giving them high quality tools they need, care little about the experience of your customer by not realizing how important it is that your cleaners speak English, and the likelihood that you pay your employees a very low amount of money compared to how much I paid for your service.

I would not recommend using this service if those are their practices.< /text>

I recently had a root canal performed here. I've been coming for years but had a lot of hesitation returning, due to past negative experiences. I even informed one of the staff members that I was hesitant and nervous to return. Her only response was "well then why did you come back?" I'm in customer service and knew her response was very passive aggressive . I knew right then and there I should had gone with my gut, walked away and never have returned. But unfortunately, I returned and had a very expensive root canal performed. Months later I was still in pain, my tooth felt infected and I called them only to have them tell me I would be charged for more X-rays and a possible extraction. Thank God I went to a Dentist that was highly recommended by a friend. I then found out that all my concerns were valid. That the root canal done on me was done poorly, it was infected and needed to be re -done.  I was overwhelmed because this root canal had cost me 2200 Dollars and I couldn't believe people had the heart to charge others this price while performing such poor work, and risking someone's health. On top of that, all the financial stress. Luckily, the Dentist I met,  felt so bad for me that and he is fixing the root canal free of charge. On top of Hacienda Dental refused to send my X-rays. They ended up sending something that was illegible and they stated they “didn’t email X-rays.”  I  am so disappointed with Hacienda Dental and feel it would be wrong for me to not share this with others.<//Text>

<text>Love this dentist! I had deep teeth cleaning, and it wasn't painful AT ALL. Dentist was patient, professional, and knew exactly what she was doing. The office is also decorated really amazing like a little Hacienda:) damn first couple reviewers are giving everyone a bad impression. This place deserves a full 5. Especially since it's probably the best dentist in Bakersfield (along with the one on Montclair)< /text>< Pictures>

If I could give this place a lower score I completely would. I had root canal work done and after was told that my next appointment would be a year later. That’s it. Nothing else. No one there told me that I didn’t have crowns placed but I guess fillings and only found out until after my tooth began hurting. The dentist took a quick look but didn’t explain to me what happened or what the next step was only had their front staff give me a consultation about how much it’s going to cost to fix my tooth. How unprofessional is that. I had no idea what was going on and left their with two quotes and ways to finance my dental work. If your looking at this place and their reviews please head my warning and don’t go here.< /text>

<Text>Sadly I have to give a one-star rating. Walking into this dental office I had High Hopes. It looks very presentable, the staff at the front are very nice and welcoming. Unfortunately other than that I can't say much else that is good. My fiance and I both had dental work done here on two separate occasions. The dentist seemed very rushed and frustrated. The dentist himself is not very welcoming although his staff are. He seems to go from Patient to Patient very quickly. Too quickly. I would not have given the bad review if it weren't for the fact that after my dental work ( 3 fillings), I had sensitivity to the area for the weeks following.  I had it checked at a different office (hall of fame) . This other office had to refill them because they were done incorrectly. My fiance had fillings done and had other work scheduled to be done but we will not return.  In his case,  they had to give him several shots to numb the area, the dentist was frustrated to the point he stopped in the middle of doing the filling and handed it over to the assistant to finish.  When we left their office, my fiances tooth was covered in bumpy sharp edged gunk.  We then went to another dental office and they were entirely appalled at how badly the work was.  Hall of fame redid his work free of cost because they were shocked at the work done by hacienda.  I don't believe it was just a bad day because it were on two separate occasions that we both had dental work done incorrectly by then. I'm sure we were not the only two to walk out of that office with issues. I recommend if you have gotten work done by Hacienda that you be seen and double checked at another office.</Text>< Name>

<Text>This place was amazing! The appearance is so inviting, you don't feel like you're in a dentist office. The staff was very helpful, courteous and cheerful.

I never do reviews, but I have had the worst dental experience here . I decided to go here because it was in my area. My first couple appointments there were okay. They cleaned my teeth and filled my cavities. I then had to have a root canal and since i hadn't had any problems with them previously why would I be over cautious now. Immediately after the procedure my tooth felt weird,  heavy or had pressured on it. I thought maybe it was because they hadn't put a crown on it and once they did it would feel normal again. They sent in the paper work for crown approval roughly four times and it kept getting denied. This is where I begin to feel uneasy. Once it was denied the fourth time they instead filled my tooth and said that was enough. Your teeth need crowns if they are not getting approved, theybdid something wrong to your teeth!! I then go see another dentist to see if they can do anything and they ask who was my previous dentist. The other dentist  says hacienda had messed up on another's patient root canal as well!!  Hacienda overfilled my nerve space and that irritated my gums and it could not be crowned. I had an abyss under my lip caused by the irritation. my other dentist then referred me to a specialist who is now going to clean and redo the root canal. I have been trying to fix this for the last 9 months, so please do not go there! I didn't  have any dental problems before going to them. They just want you money!</review>

The staff was great. Making an appointment was very fast and easy. My complaint is with the performance of the doctor only.  He was very unprofessional, did a horrible job on my fillings. I had to go back two different occasions. The first time one of my fillings was poking out and had to go back to have that polished down and he still didn’t do it correctly😞 I also had work done on my top molar on a different day and the filling was horrible as well! I couldn’t even floss through that teeth and had to go make the next day and have that fix. I would not recommend this place to anyone👎<//Text>

<Text>Worst painful first filling and crown experience. They did the temporary wrong and hurt when they took it out for the original crown. Crowns last for 5yrs is what they said but it only lasted me a couple months. I didn't eat on it nothing it just fell out because the cement. Worst customer service.Called an they said that they take walk-ins at 2:00 and when I came they said everyone is at lunch and won't return at 2:30. I live by Bakersfield college and I came all the way to Panama to waist my time. Then the receiptionst gives me attitude saying u can leave and make an appointment. All because I said next time please let me know before I waist my time and gas to go on the other side of town<//Text>< name>

Dr. Reddy is an amazing doctor and the staff at Hacienda is really warm and friendly. They always take good care of me and always make sure I am comfortable. I’ve had my wisdom teeth taken out here and I also had a root canal and fillings done here as well with Dr. Reddy and I absolutely do not have any complaints. I also got braces here as well and I am sure the results will be good :)</text>

<Review>HATE IT....  my first visit was great they had to make a fill in two of my tooth JUST A FILL but for some reason Dr said I needed a root canal  I didn't have pain or sensitivity BUT he's the dentist so my second visit was for the root canal  when they were filling he decided NOT to do the root canal cuz I didn't needed it I was feeling good  Sooo they made another appointment cuz they found a cavity on my other side so when I was home I started filling my teeth uneven and weird when I started eating one of my tooth started hurting BAD BAD .... On my third visit I told the nurse what was happening then she told dentist and I felt he got mad and told nurse to schedule another appointment they never scheduled the appointment.. I didn't want to anyways that was it no more visits to this place.
Staff was great tho...  Sooo friendly and they make you feel so comfortable...... (Nurses, and receptionits.)</Review>< pics>

The staff were so kind and gentle from the front desk to the techs and doctor.
Extractions and dentures were done right.

<Text>I just want to say how great ful I am that they were able to help us right away. My own dentist wasn't even able to help us because they only take emegencys in the morning knowing it was severe so someone recommended us here and  they took her right away. Everyone was great and the office manager Marc was super helpful. I am so great ful and just happy they helped my mom .Thank you everyone at hacienda dental .I give them 10 stars and truly recommend this dental office.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>If 'zero' stars would be available that is the rating this place deserves. My father went in to get a clean up and ended up getting a cavity filled in. The staff here ended up doing far less than an acceptable job and my father ended up returning 3 more times because the cap or filling that they put in kept falling off. No other dentist would touch the work they did and my father ended up getting the nerve for the tooth removed/dead. Horrible work, avoid at all cost.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I had a root canal done here . Shortly after the tooth was reinfected!!! The root canal was done incorrectly . I have to travel all the way to Ucla to get a root canal retreatment. My experience here wasnt the best and i had to delete my review about it because they wouldn't see me otherwise. But im glad I decided to stop going here . Rethink your decision about this place . Speaking of , they did uneccassary fillings on my friends back molars witch he had to get removed when he got his braces placed.</Review>

The new girls at the front desk are rude, the wait is too long, the filling they did fell off, the crown they put on fell off, they ended up doing extra staff and charging me more $$ because they don't take the time to explain the procedure and the care after, they only have appointments for ortho every other Sat and the list goes on. Very disappointed with this place. I am tranfering all my family to a different dentist, if you don't want to have all these issues find a more professional dentist. Zero stars for this place!< /text>

I didn't like this place so much. The wait is kinda long and is somewhat unprofessional when it comes to the dental assistants. I feel like they are not one on one with patient and leave and take forever to come back. The chairs in the waiting area suck too. And not enought chair for people to sit down in i had to wait outside and have them call me outside and its winter right now.... Dont recommend😔😔👎👎< /review>

I'm so great full for this dentist office. The dentist and his staff were truly amazing! I walked in with so much pain and walked out with none. They gave me such great attention and didn't make me feel unwanted. Th eyes rushed me back even though I didn't have an appt. I've been terrified of dentist for too long now and bcus of him and his staff I feel at ease going to the dentist now. Thank you Hacienda Dental!</Text>

This place sucks. There's only one dentist in that building and on top of that he won't finish one person at a time. He would do a little here & a little there skipping from patient to patient. HORRIBLE!!!< /text>

<Review>Solid tiny patch of turf (not really a dog park per se) in dtsj for your fluffers to run around a bit, take a potty break and meet some friends. Came by in the morning and met one other friendly dog. Poop bags were provided, but no water. Expertly curated to make use of some small spaces in the city. Only two spots in the tiny lot, but we grabbed street parking on Almaden. Get there by staying on Almaden. Right in front of the bus stop! I like the murals and the potted plants. Give the patch of turf a nicer feel. Good if you're in a rush, but we prefer Del Monte dog park.<//Review>< resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Was surprised to find this little park in the heart of downtown. It was a nice little place to have a dog run around without their leashes. Doggie bags are provided but there is no water, so be sure to bring some along. Plenty of seating border the park, a few planters, logs and an amazing mural make this park fantastic 😀< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNWGirE8u0FPBglfeUWEQwMETfcrERCTHc_u5O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxYhvWPK77JqbP7J26g_gl3POawghWOsgKQI2T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fcca39f452823:0x65d052e1dec5f388< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great community at the park, friendly people and dogs. The star the loose is mainly because either park is very small, which makes it hard to get large dogs tired, also it is all turff with no real grass or plants anywhere.
The people here though are some of the nicest and friendliest we have met at a dog park.</Review>

Centrally located in downtown SJ ... convenient for a quick stop.  Bags are provided inside the park.  Great art work.  On a side note, people PLEASE remember to clean up after your dog.<//Review>

Beautiful murals, flowerpots and flowers, and nice astroturf and fencing, but this place gets really smelly.  Homeless people often use it as their camp site at night and sometimes during the day which makes an already small dog park even smaller.  Our dog found chocolate cake spilled out onto the astroturf and got to eat most of it before we caught up to pull him away.  One of the people using the park as a campsite was sure to point it that she “ [doesnt care about cleaning up her trash because] she doesn’t have a dog.” Disappointing because it has lots of potential.<//Review>

Though as small as it is, it's just big enough for my 4 legged children to run and play. It's always clean and doesn't run out of poop bags for doggie waste. The plants are a nice touch. Would like to see a water spout to fill water bowls for dogs and maybe a covered area for the heat of the sun. Absoluly no shadein the early afternoon.<//Text>

<text>A cute, convenient "park" in the middle of downtown San Jose. It's small, and hardly a park by most standards, but for those that may be in DTSJ and want to meet with other furry friends for playtime, and keep the streets clean, it's better than nothing and provides an off leash oportunity for your dog friends and you!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>How can anyone complain about this little hidden gem?  besides, its for your dog not you.  would your dog complain about not providing water (that's your responsibility)  or other people not picking up poop?  Doubt it! they dont have time to complain.. theyre too busy playing in this adorable, gated area.  it's (very) roughly 30 -35 feet long and 20 across with
access 24 hours. Bags are provided in this cute area where your dog can be a dog in a part of town dogs are out of their natural   element . what a great place.. it's got chunks of wood, flowers, benches, beautiful deco and all behind a double gate entry that's accessible 24 hours.  people that don't pick up after their dogs poop, should immediately be called on it IMHO bcuz with bags provided, there's no excuse. And if not, show your appreciation and pay it forward.. YOU pick it up. if you aren't part of the solution, you're part of the problem.

a big thanks to whoever funded, and now maintains, this sweet  dog area. my dog and i LOVE it.<//review></record>

(Translated by Google) [Dog and Dog Park] San Jose is a city that loves dogs and technology, so it is not surprising that there are many dog ​​parks in San Jose. The Dog Park is a park where dogs exercise and play in a controlled environment under the supervision of their owners. The dog park has separate double-gate entry and exit points, benches for dog owners to rest, and trash cans for handling animal waste. In addition, the dog park also provides wheelchair access.

(Original)
【狗狗🐶公园一瞥】圣何塞是个热爱狗和科技的城市，所以在圣何塞有很多狗狗公园也就不足为奇了。狗狗公园是狗狗在主人的监督下，在受控的环境下进行运动和玩耍的公园。狗狗公园有独立双栅入口点和出口点,狗主人休息的长椅和处理动物粪便的垃圾桶等。此外，狗狗公园还提供轮椅通道。<//Review>

I bought some extensions in this place but they damaged in a week. The extension hair got tough and tangled. The extensions are of poor quality and very expensive.  Call the manager and gave many meaningless excuses.  I removed them and it was money thrown away.  Do not buy in this place are better online and cheap.</Text>

Both times I visited the ladies were EXTREMELY helpful. It being my first purchasing hair, the owner took her time helping my match my hair & suggestion a great brand. I ABSOLUTELY think the hair quality & customer service is exceptional.< /review>

Always good customer service. Have been coming here for years. I believe it is family owned.. but today I went to purchase a few things and they were not open. Sat their for 15 min past 9 and still not open. There is a new hair shop across from the edwards. . Will be taking my business there from here on out. Because this isn't the 1st time they were not open on time.</Text>

Very overpriced if you're trying to do weave or braids etc. I requested an appointment with Rochelle many days earlier. I got to my appointment on time and she didn't show up till and hour later. The girl that ended up braiding(I forgot her name but shes a black lady who wears glasses) did a terrible job. I told her I wanted full individual braids I even showed her a picture in which she agreed she can do it. I sat down and I kept asking her to make sure she makes it full. I even told Dorris and they kept reassuring me it would be good. When she was finished I looked at myself and at the hair, it was as though a 12 year old had braided my hair who just started practicing. I was so shocked and sad that I wasted time and she did not care to make my hair look like what I showed her on the picture. It was the complete opposite almost like a nightmare. Unfortunately despite my depression and unsatisfaction, And even tho I called my mother who knows Dorris and we had been good customers for several years, she still made me pay $140. I took out eh braids the next day. Just terrible. Never going back.<//Text>

<Review>Even though I always buy my braiding hair from here, it’s NEVER been open on time when I come. The hours say 9:00am but I’m usually waiting parked out front until 9:45am (if I’m lucky). That’s really the only thing that concerns me for this shop.<//Review><Rating>3<//Rating>< gmap_id>

HORRIBLE customer service! Doris is an extremely rude lady, and the prices are extremely to high. Her son and husband are kind but idk what happen to her. I came back to return hair because I accidentally got the wrong one keep in my I was there 5 min ago and she wouldn’t exchange it. I come to this place faithfully, I didn’t even want my money back just an exchange. I know many friends that don’t go to her anymore and now that will be me. She also is very expensive than other beauty supply stores but other races won’t know that cause she’s the only beauty supply that carries a lot of stuff in West Covina. I repeat do not GO HERE!< /text>

<text>This shop sucks!! It should be called
THE SHADY SHAT BACK SHACK FOR GHETTO RACHETS! Only reason i gave it 1star is to give you THE REAL DEAL ON THIS CHEAP FILTHY HOT MESS WANNA BE BEAUTY STORE! LET ME ALSO NOTE
******************************************
***THE ONLY REASON I PURCHASED AT ALL FROM THE NASTY BACK SHACK WAS TO GET PAID TO GET PAID$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ BACK*************************************First of all the owner is one unhappy person she dont smile SHE DOESNT GREET HER GUESTS, She is not polite, she is rude, she doesnt help her customers she tells the others to help the guests while stands looking around watching for thieves that i don't know why would want to steal her cheap products, she stay with a dirty look on her face looks like she going thru a divorce...and all she wants is for you to hurry up pick yo shat, pay for your shat, and get up out her face and on your way!! Im serious!
The 2 workers seemed nice and scared af of the owner...clearly the front Worker had to be her daughter because i dont know why anyone would work for that mean bossy grumpy owner!!!  The store is CRAMPED, DIRTY, SUPER DUSTY, ESPECIALLY THE BATHROOM which is about as clean as a truckers gas station on a good day! She was rude to my child, who she did not even acknowledge until after I made my purchase, then she told my child to "move out the way for the ladies that got to pay now"...while I examined the bathroom
They put all the wigs up high as the cieling in low light so you cant see at all the real quality of the wigs which they get down for you and then have to dust off behind the counter, they let you try it on, the same chick will give you one price then when you pull out your money the owner rings up UPING to another price, they do not give you a fresh new packaged wig so when you ask to get some scissors to cut off factory tag they then throw that away...then oh let me tell you about their wanna be salon back shack yes a BACK SHACK!! Dirty, crowded, no design style unless it was designed by oscar the grouch and he got all the old dated salon chairs, sink, salon tables, hair setters, mirrors and the toilet for free from the dump yard! Im telling you i wouldnt sit back there with one of them hairdressers even if they was known to have good skills the establishment is dirty, overpriced, and CAPITAL G-H-E-T-T-O and all they play is trap music! Yes GHETTO even had a crazy chick acting like she just left the funny farm and a couple of crack addicts hanging around seem to know the 'worker' that waitted on me. The only thing missing was a stripper pole and plate of fried chicken n chitlins!!! From the outside this used consignment store look like an 99¢ and up store for old outdated halloween wigs and  Factory closeouts! Bunk BUSTED AND RACHET! If you wanna have a good day DONT GO HERE!! ORDER ONLINE @ the WISH app get a way better deal without shaty service!< /text><userid>118237452556891854585< /userid><username>MRS DORIGHT<//username><rate>1</rate>< date>

This place is aweful!!!! My pregnant sister went in to get extentions for her baby shower and she specifically asked the attendant that she wanted long extentions since her hair is medium length and the attendant guaranteed that she was getting long extentions. She went home and took the hair out and it was a little less than an inch longer than her hair! When she called to return it they told her she couldnt and that she'd get a discount on another package. She spent $60 on thoes extentions that she CANT USE! Horrible service!!! The manager was very rude over the phone and hung up on me and would not even exchange them. DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE!!!< /review>

<text>This place is so bad very rude customer service.I went in today looking and the lady was following us around thinking we're going to take something.We couldn't even move it so tight and little in there.Their always nice.When we went today they were very racis nobody deserves to be treated so rude and uncomfortable to the point that they can't shop.I suggest not to go there.And maby they should change your attitude because nobody gunna want to go there.</text></record>

I go to this tiny little hole in the wall Salvadoran restaurant sometimes when in L.A. it's very small but truly authentic. The pupusas are so good. The sopa de res beef soup is very flavorful. Not expensive.  Service is not bad.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I love the food here. I have eaten roast meat, breakfasts, beef soup, fried mojarra, etc. Everything has come out fresh and with good service inside what fits. The cashier does agree that she is pedantic, but the rest of the team are cool. The clients are very regular and each day there are different specials.

Me encanta la comida de aqui. Eh comido carne Asada, desayunos, sopa de res, mojarra frita, etc. Todo me a salido fresco y con buen servicio dentro lo que cabe.

(Translated by Google) The food is fine, but deprorable customer service, the cashier with an attitude of anger and not at all friendly without even responding to the greeting charges you and throws you the Exchange money. FIRST AND LAST TIME. 😡

(Translated by Google) The pupusas were raw, the empanadas burned and sour, the meat pies toasted and the cut chilate. When we told the owner, she laughed and went to the kitchen to talk to the cook. Very bad service
Pupusas were not fully cooked, empandas were burnt, pastelitos were overcooked, chilate sour as well. Bad customer service

Las pupusas estaban crudas, las empanadas quemadas y acidas, los pastelitos de carnes tostados y el chilate cortado. Cuando le dijimos a la dueña se rio y se fue a la cocina a platicar con la cocinera. Muy mal servicio

<review>(Translated by Google) I am very angry and very dissatisfied with this restaurant, I order pupusas with chicharron and they give me all with cheese only, he called them and they still doubt my words. If I buy to take home it is to eat more at ease and so I do not feel like eating, he asks me to return them but it is rush hour and the traffic is super heavy.

(Original)
Estoy muy enojado y muy desconforme  con este restaurante, ordeno pupusas con chicharron y me dan todas con queso solamente, los llamó y todavia dudan de mis palabras.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Terrible they restore. Even to take the order they are so slow worse than a turtle and the food worse the truth I do not recommend them. I think that because of bad service and bad food, it has no customers. Because when I went there, only three people were there and it was a Saturday so you can imagine why

(Original)
Pésimo restauran .asta para agarrar la orden son tan lentas peor q una tortuga y la comida peor la verdad no se los recomiendo. Creo q por mal servicio y mala comida no tiene clientes .por que cuando fui tres personas nada más estaban y era un sábado así q ya se imaginarán porque<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Horrible, I asked for a vegetarian pupusa and the taste was ugly, and aside the cheese was old, and when I told the cook, I take a very ugly attitude, and said that what I was saying was lies, I do not return to that place, My experience was most disgusting.

Horrible, pedi una pupusa vegetariana y el sabor era feo, y aparte el queso estaba viejo, y cuando le dije a la cocinera, tomo una actitud bien fea, y dijo que lo que yo estaba diciendo era mentiras, no vuelvo a ese lugar,  mi experincia fue de lo mas disgustante.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2b8f70b3d35e1:0xdf366fd6d343ed0e< /GmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) The food is good, but the service makes you want to throw the comfort on your face wings. Pair in tuncos with the crouched cabesa. My first time and the last one in this place.

(Original)
La comida esta buena, pero el servicio dan ganas de tirarle la comodida el la cara alas que alludan. Paresen tuncos con la cabesa agachada. Mi primera ves y la ultima en este lugar.< /Review>

Joaquin was amazing. He was quick to make 5 sandwiches. He was also friendly and had great recommendations. I would recommend this Subway on the Mesa to anyone who wants a quick bite for a great price.< /review>

It’s a very beautiful, nice and quite neighborhood with a very well kept park .Residents in the community were very diversed, respectful , loving in keeping , and maintaining the community peaceful and environmentally friendly . Not too mention, the park is very kid and animal friendly. It is always clean and well kept garden. You’ll see different types of flowers bloom at different seasons of the year . Its a perfect weather for all times walking in the park. If you love the fresh air breeze, you will experience it here.
Im glad that I chose this community  to live in because it is always feels “Like Home “ experience.
Come live and visit this place ❤️🐶❤️</Text>

Stroll around the lake, let the kids play baseball, or soccer, or have the younger kids play in the play park.  Spend the afternoon fishing in the lake, or have a family gathering at the picnic tables with BBQ's.  Dog owner? Keep your pup hydrated with the doggie drinking fountain, and plenty of bags and trash cans for clean up.

The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review? There's no toilet facilities. This means you can't really spend too much time at the park.</Review>

Great park. Just wish the city or someone would put dog bags into the empty dog bag containers. I think if they did, maybe people would actually start picking up after their dogs. People are actually leaving their filled dog bags underneath one of the empty containers, which is beyond gross. I think that’s almost worse than just leaving on the ground.
Otherwise, very nice park. Just watch where you’re stepping.</Text>

<text>For our household, this is our go-to spot for lunch especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We usually will call ahead to place our order before heading over to pick up our food. Sometimes they might not pick-up if they are very busy. In those cases, you can just show up and place your order. The employees have good memories and usually will recognize who you are if you're a regular.

While they have decent pho, we usually order one of their rice or vermicelli dishes.  While we prefer their beef, you can also get each dish with chicken or pork. Here are a couple of our favorites:
#27 Com Cha Bo Chao - Charbroiled beef, baked minced meat & egg, shrimp paste served with rice
#46 Bun Bo Chao Cha Gio - Charbroiled beef, shrimp paste, egg roll served with vermicelli</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfOTN7bd8OQ7CLByeYM3DO8uCpAspVdACnPaFU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvgBoVwTZRt0GOYeOSGcKCV_JR9L5ZseDTjCHA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUJPQA-m90710O7aUKE1MLDlWNglbQnvCBR5RI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8w_GZnNJiQLKF8Drxk-YZBOA-SF6ewSjN2cnh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHq9Snjlb3IRkgDCw3ZPnLJkyIkM68A_cSQ6MP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPQSFE-cBJzDZbCNFX50HfglmcIyvQYmRdScMy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_UOUugM4vrxfESpRDKqO2HVWkfebpejA0Ff8T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIF3MLif3Zf8i3N3jfddDw3bPLCORBY7sVxZRg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKz2-YQyzVvU8er6l_uR37x6BWZtu67t4muDti=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJnVE2TZr6DyLfy8sAAfzyaS93-Rk--Nov0WYA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkO_0KrI3t2AGFnk563VYHcpYEk7XdpcJMsM17=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6Ef-K-GTGM6SZkaBNfOgzFiDudCH1oqwsoi0Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcGOANf7Fbytmnz4sVteDQ3k9Mj2xDLm3pr4Qw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3pADXXqj675mqtYtbiIy5kqNYR7S2GW2ekmU1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1rYSqUaZhcxc0dqyu9X3Yzzi3PDDOI9BEIUrx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

Food used to be really tasty. However, my recent take out was a big disappointment. Beef soup tasted diluted. Quantity of vermicelli was smaller. Fried egg roll was substituted with that with taro filling. This used to be the go to place to filled my Vietnamese food craving. I am sad to see it is going down this path.</review>

I had the noodle seafood soup. It was very good I just don't care for imitation crab. I'd rather have a good piece of fish than crab made out of fish🤪 Had the Thai tea, It to was very flavorful. The best of all is are prices are very reasonable.  I would recommend and I probably will go back</review>

I'm a regular at this place and my family and girlfriend love it here too! Really kind and attentive owner, plus the prices are really inexpensive for the generous portion size. It's 100% comfort-food level in my opinion, and I never tire of it.

My recommendations: The #1 Pho is a great standard order, especially shared with one other family member. The broth is always piping hot and soul soothing unlike some other nearby Pho places. Be sure to ask for a side of white onions too! Also, I really like the fried egg rolls appetizer too.

For rice: #25 or #29 (Charbroiled Pork, Baked Minced Meat & Egg, and either #25 Shrimp Paste or #29 Meat Balls). Big taste in these orders, but the portion size for baked rice dishes is just slightly lesser compared to the other orders, but perfect for a single person. I recommend it if you're ordering for quality taste rather than quantity and/or needing to share family-style.

For vermicelli: #45 or #56 (Charbroiled Pork, Fried Egg Rolls, and #45 Shrimp Paste or #56 Meat Balls). Tastes healthy and really fresh, plus resuming with generous portion sizes. The fish sauce included with this and the baked rice is no joke and tastes wonderful!

Lastly, if you're not eating out with your S.O. and are a fan of durian, the Durian shake with boba is divine. I almost always order a cup at the end to take home!<//text>

Poor customer service and the staff sounded upset and was being rushed to order. Food is okay. Came here to order to go during pandemic of 2020 so orders were to go only. Guess they rather you call to order but the menu wasn't posted online.<//review>

<Text>My husband and I come here for lunch once a week. The place is clean and the food is delicious. We've tried many food options but our regular is nr 1 option, the special in a large bowl, that can be shared and the Vietnamese coffee. The pho it has a natural taste and it comes with basil, jalapeño, bean sprouts and lime.
I believe they are not using MSG, because I never get headache after I eat it as I am usually getting after eating MSG food.
The Vietnamese coffee is amazing and if you never tried one before, you should at least try it once!!
On lunch time it can get pretty packed but their service is very fast and we never had to wait for our table.
The servers are very friendly, polite, they speak English, Vietnamese and Chinese. At least we know of one lady that speaks all 3 languages.
Parking spots in  the front of the restaurant but there is also the Stater Bros supermarket with additional big parking lots in the same plaza.
Additional bonus the restaurant it is next to East West Bank in case you need some cash or just banking in general.
Enjoy :)<//Text>< rate>

THIS is a high school stadium. The home side (east, nearest the parking lot) seating is concrete and there's plenty of it. Visiting side (west) are bleachers. The field is nicely maintained. There's a snack shack on the south side of the field that you can get actual food at. The bathrooms are nice, fresh, & clean. They have a dedicated ticket office and well controlled entry and exit. Overall quite a nice experience.</Review>

Amazing turf and loads of seats for the football games.  It is almost always open to the public whenever high school sports aren't occuring.  The crowd depends on what time you go.<//text>

<text>I witnessed a public servant (police officer) use the restroom today with no issue. When I tried to use the restroom a store associate with the name tag Chris said they were closed to the public. I asked him so why was the police officer allowed to use the restroom? His response was well they’re are public servants. I asked Chris for his manager. Ivy came over and said I could use the restroom but normally they are closed to the public. This was very upsetting because no where is this policy addressed in store or online or anywhere for that matter. Following up with corporate to address this discrimination< /text>< response>

I don't like some of the drinks most drinks called frappuccinos don't have coffee in them. The cold brew and teas are really good tho and if you're with a large group of people they have multiple options for a range of diets. However they've been low on a lot of things recently<//review>

<Review>Went through the drive through and like all Starbucks of course it was packed BUT this, drive through actually moved pretty smoothly!! Went cause the hubby works nights so needed a little pick me up and the Chai Tea Iced Latte is the perfect cure... Unfortunately the customer ahead of us was a huge problem and wouldn't leave until she got her discount... Really lady... Representative handled it well and finally line moved...< /Review>< gmapID>

Drive through took longer than it should have but the macchiato was great, the veggie wrap even better.<//review>

Im at Starbucks everyday sometimes twice a day. I go to three locations because I love the Ribbion Crunch drink with add ons a $8.00 drink My drink was made without my add ons I called they said come tomorrow and we will fix it. I call and call no answer so I go to the Rosecrans location. Next day.I call again Carmen made it feel like I was trying to get something free saying "Ill do it this time but you know" while she was talkingto me as Im less then I orded my dri n0k on the app. I order everyday Sometimes two. Im never coming back to this location. Ever<//text>

<Review>I waited in a 40 min or more in a drive thru for 2 venti java chip frappuccinos. The staff is very friendly at this location. I normally place a mobile order because it is faster. The inside of the store was closed today so I had to go through the drive thru. I found a giant ball of ice in one of the drinks which is why I'm giving 2 stars.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

We were in line for what seemed about 40 minutes, waiting to order and not one employee let the cars in front of me or behind that they were closed. mind you we came through drive through at around 9 and when we got to the window we were just ignored. I tried letting the cars behind me know we were closed when I should’ve even HAVE TO. That needs to be better taken care of.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

These people are not professionals and they are disrespectful. They told me to wait 20 minutes for a coffee and other customers arrived and attended them quickly and when I asked about my coffee they told me it was my fault. The name of the person who told me is my fault is cynthia so I hope the manager do something</text>

The baristas ARE! very rude. If you guys turned that spot into a pick up window or drive thru pick up for the pizza you guys sell there or also to pick up my prescriptions me and many members of our community would appreciate it.get this to 1,000 views to inspire a better future a fair one and one with no discrimination.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2cb456f452a03:0xef9f90249cb38640< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Terrible wait times, drinks are terrible. They are watered down and too much playing around when being helped. Getting my pastry took forever, like 10 mins for a chocolate Danish smh.< /review>

<review>The service was great. The lady who works there is awesome. Idk why this is a 4 star rating. It should be a 5 star rating. EVERYONE should come and drive out here and try this Starbucks. The lady said that she makes your drinks with love.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Bad service starting with the employee and the supervisor... I order my drinks and the employee repeated so when I went to the window she gave me the wrong size drinks and she expected me to get off my car to get the drinks then when I call to speak to the supervisor, she's one of the dumbest workers ever and was exactly like the employee. I highly do not recommend this Starbucks!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I see why this particular Starbucks has a 3.3 star rating. Poor service especially with the “manager” Carmen who was very rude and has a very poor attitude not the star bucks I know. She represent the uniform she wears very poorly with a frown 👎🏼People like her making great companies like Starbucks look bad!<//Text>< resp>

I’ve come here almost every week, most days they have slight attitude but disregarding that the drinks are normally good. Monday they ran out of the ingredients for the java chip, fine. Today I spoke to JOHNNY, the worst service I have received was giggling and laughing in the background when I drew his attention to order, I finally received annoyed voice and ignoring my request over servers minutes Unfortunately I have came to this place numerous chances and I will not bring my service here every morning.< /review>

The worst Starbucks in the area. Not only are they slow, but your drinks are never right. They are always out Of something. Bagels, Medicine ball, dragon fruit, caramel something. And when you approach the manager the (African American) Tenisha, teysha something like that
she is ghetto and rude herself so go figure why the employees here are always frowning looking like they hate their jobs. They should close this Starbucks and open up another establishment who will bring great customer service because this store lacks on it. Save your money & time. Do not go to this store. The one in target makes the drinks faster & Correct the first time!<//text>

< review>
The employees are friendly however I visited there a couple times and my drinks wasn’t to my liking. Also they weed out of the Strawberry Refresher. They didn’t prepare which is a downfall to me. You know the weather is changing and what customer look forward to. So prepare. Not run out.</review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Very horrible service. Ive came here with my daughter previously and the service was horrible. They took way too long making one venti caramel frap with very little cars in the drive thru. I spent about 30 minutes waiting. We came back hoping for a difference but no. Again, we waited about 45 minutes for one drink that they didnt even do right. Worst Starbucks ever, never coming back.< /text><pics>None< /pics><user>106198075819829473450<//user><username>Lupe Quezada<//username><Gmap_id>0x80c2cb456f452a03:0xef9f90249cb38640< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>This is one of the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. I've had to have my money refunded at least 3 times. I was hopeful that management would not only fix how long the wait is (drive thru can take up to 40 minutes) but I was also hoping that they'd train the staff on how to make drinks that aren't mediocre in flavor. A $4.75 cup of coffee shouldn't be room temperature and taste stale. This Happened on a few occasions... Needless to say my coworkers and I go to another Starbucks... Its a bit further, but worth it.< /review>< rating>

<rate>1< /rate><review>This starbucks takes too long to get your order and it takes even twice as long to receive it. IF you can't handle working in a fast paced beverage restaurant why are you working there. Not to mention the order taker is rude .. will never come to this place again rather jump out my car and go to the shack in TARGET.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2cb456f452a03:0xef9f90249cb38640<//GmapID></record>

But recently  there is an employee who works the register,  with little braids and always wears a military hat. She has t he worse service I have ever experienced in my life. Whenever I  come in, it seems she has a personal vendetta against me. I went in just now, and she deliberately would not take my order. I was there yesterday and she gave me a hard time. Starbucks you have to do Better . I know under that blanket of anger she has, there is a sweet person. I can't wait to see bc she has potential to be something else rather than being at the counter.< /Review>< pictures>

THERE WAS A MICE IN THE SPEAKER BOX.     AlsoI had ordered two venti vanilla bean with caramel drizzle and one pecan something latte and they gave me a hot one instead of iced. So if you love the taste of Starbucks with nice then the right place is here. Also they are rude.</text>

<Text>The drive they today was suuuuuuper slow. I was probably waiting 10-15 min, which for a drive they is forever. It seemed like there were only 3 people working there, which is not enough for such a busy location. The guy at the window was alright. No attitude but no friendly banter either. Maybe they were understaffed?

The mocha frap I ordered was pretty basic. It tasted ok. Not amazing.<//Text><resp>None</resp><Name>Sarah Flores</Name><Rate>3< /Rate>< Pictures>

<resp>None< /resp><text>If I could rate 0 stars, of course I would. This is the worse Starbucks experience I have ever had. As a My Starbucks Rewards Gold Status member since December, 2012, I must say this is unacceptable. I came to claim a reward once - they didn't have the MSR program. The next visit, they had run out of whipped cream and never informed me of the fact until served. Now, I came today and got two Iced Teas. I went to get a free refill, and they charged me for them and served them with lemonade. When I asked her for the reimbursement and told her I didn't order it with lemonade, she said I couldn't claim rewards in this Starbucks, hence she couldn't return the money to me. I'm so done with this place. I love Starbucks, but this is too much. I hope the new place in this same area opens as soon as possible.< /text><userid>109229059473644353702<//userid>< Time>

This place is good it just takes longer than usual. We went thru the drive thru but ended up backing out because we didn't move for about 5-7 minutes. We were basically parked in the drive thru. When we were backing out from the drive thru the line still hadn't moved. We ended up leaving but then came back. This time we went inside and it didnt take too long, maybe 7-10 minutes. The drinks and the sandwich were really good.</text>

not a big fan of this location. my mobile order along with a few coworkers are NEVER prepared on time. In the past I have ordered something that wasn't even available. Didn't find that out until I had got their, and they were pretty rude about it. The employees here can be a little rude I have seen it happening to other customers while I'm in.</Review>

Awful service. Today is 1/12/18 i went in there at 9:15pm and had to wait 35 min. for my coffee that i never got, so i asked for my money back because i noticed that the guy making the drinks kept skipping my cup to serve the drive-thru which i think is an awful and unfair way to do business, i know its not the employees fault because that call has to come from management but the way the 2 african american male employees commented and laughed at me when i asked for my money back was so embarrassing. Im a hard working person that treats everyone with the up most respect so I WILL BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION TO VIDEO RECORD THESE INAPPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS AND POST IT ON YOUTUBE SO EVERYONE MAY SEE HOW BUSINESS IS RAN HERE. Not very happy with this location and mark my words I WILL BE BACK< /Text>

Not professional at all. I've come here over a dozen times. I get it it's located in Compton.  I get it everybody needs a job. But people like me come here before work or after to relax and  enjoy the music, wifi, and day.
Instead I'm always bothered by rude employees.  Never greeted.  I'm rushed to order. Not given proper manners.  I've asked for recommendations and have received attitudes as if its it's NOT YOUR BARISTASJOB!!! TO help/ sell coffee/tea... NOT to mention Tables never cleaned , i have to ask for a rag and I've been asked to move 3 different times because an employee is on their break and chooses to sit right infront.
If youre going to hire rude people at least have a better environment .  A clean environment.<//text>

Horrible waiting time. It took an hr to get 4 Frapps. Turns out they forgot to write down one of the drinks, so it took another 30 mins to get the last drink.</Review>

Avoid this place at any price they absolutely suck I went there on a sunday to get a frappe and two other drinks, it took them  30 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we finally got our drinks and also the frappe wasn't even frozen and it tasted nasty the other drinks were not the exception not sure what they serve us I also saw one of the batista guys that was smoking outside just toss his cigarret butt on the sidewalk with total disregard and so you been warned stay awayi< /text>

Went today to Starbucks, and they skipped my order and almost forgot to make my order and had to be reminded.
I would be more upset but it seemed like there was only one person making drinks while everyone one else is playing around with customers that I'm assuming they are friends with and even walked into the back room
Felt like they where unprofessional on my visit today.<//text>

It was by far the worst Starbucks experience I've had.  The staff seems to be distracted most of the time.. the orders are being sent out completely wrong. (More than 2x) . there doesn't seem to be any communication amongst the staff . Worst experience by far.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Last night I made a line for 30
Minutes on the walk true and when I wanted to order there was no recording or someone to let them know that they were no longer attending. I went to the window and honked to see if the employees were saying something to me but ignored me until finally one of them signaled to me that they were closed. It makes me very rude that they don't have any notice when they are closed. We were several customers on the line who wasted time. Very bad service

(Original)
Anoche hice línea por 30
Minutos en el walk true y cuando quise ordenar no había ninguna grabación o alguien que hiciera saber que ya no estaban atendiendo . Llegue a la ventana y toque la bocina para ver si los empleados me decían algo pero me ignoraron hasta que al fin uno de ellos me hizo una seña indicando que estaban cerrados. Se me hace muy descortés que no tengan ningún aviso cuando ya están cerrados . Fuimos varios clientes en la línea que perdimos el tiempo. Muy mal servicio</Text>
