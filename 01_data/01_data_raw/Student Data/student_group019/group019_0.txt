They don't have many options of yogurts and the fruit bar is always dirty. You guys have to improved alot. I went the day the Dodgers won the place was empty no costumes and super dirty. Not goood sorry I love the san fernando I don't mind to drive extra for a cleaner place and more flavors.</text>

great yogurt but they never have yogurt in the machines and when you ask the employees they just tell you that they don’t have that flavor because they don’t want to refill at that moment also the bar is always dirty</Review>

<text>This location has very very bland flavors nothing you usually see in yogurtland. They have very basic flavors like strawberry, regular yogurt, and banana. I’m surprised they didn’t even have the cheesecake one that all of them have. It was mostly like a yogurt but smoothie flavors... was odd. Wasn’t even good.</text><GmapID>0x80c290db9f684cf1:0x9bf3e70dc3eb6bf5<//GmapID><userid>109998776127873774719<//userid><Response>{'time': 1567610646600, 'text': "Yad  , We are sorry your experience wasn't up to our standards.

I have the membership in the points with Yogurtland and when I did the points in the reward system it was really easy and great to use, or downloading the app it was so simple and I was able to get the points so that’s why I write this review just point out how easy it is with the app and how useful it is for other people. Recommend a place to all the Yogurtland her really well treated and fresh and clean<//text>

Although the frozen yogurt was good, half of it was not working on a Thursday at 9:30pm. 8/16 flavors were not working including most basics such as Strawberry and Chocolate. The add-ins were not full either. The establishment is clearly under-staffed. Hiring more would allow for them to keep the machines working.</Text>

There are so many toppings options too! Kind of pricey, but join the rewards program and they'll send you occasional coupons and discounts.< /text><userid>101218798439709659555</userid>< response>

The staff is great but like so many places right now there is no public restroom. When asked where the closest restroom is the staff recommended another business, which also has no public restroom. Just not a good experience for a person who uses Peet's and the Nut Tree as an equidistant meeting location. Easier to just get crappier coffee at a gas station. At least they'll have a bathroom... probably.< /Text>

<Review>This is the first time I've been to a Peets that wasn't in Berkeley or Emeryville and was a little thrown off at how big it is in comparison but I love the energy, the super nice and helpful staff. The comfy indoor and outdoor seating. And that the coffee still taste just as great! And neat restrooms.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoM4sbs0hS0aLGmTxlERQnjbZz81BmkiVuhaTK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY8YFERNXkL0DBO1Z-LIMoLH8N5a17GgtTWRrG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2pTI30aPc-3icDRHLUfK4e9FKkGzmUhPYY-Fb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

It's Peet's, what can really be said? Obviously the products are first class. Unfortunately the location offers horrendous parking due to location popularity, and what's with the ridiculous hours, or lack thereof.<//text>

I always order here but today will be my final time. I ordered a chocolate caramel swirl javiva with 2 added shots. I didn't get the 2 added shots and the drink came separated not blended, it wasnt completely full and hardly any whip cream.  Business isn't up to standards<//text>

Excellent coffee but seems even more pricey than Starbucks if that's possible. Don't like the bathroom, felt kinda unclean. Service was kind and friendly and not too busy. Outdoor seating area is nice albeit on a busy street.</Review>

This is a very nice store, that is clean and organized and has quite nice staff. It's a quiet environment that provides really great coffee and very tasty treats. The service seems to be quite fast so that you can get in and out without a really long wait. They also have outdoor seating. This is also a very popular place, but unfortunately parking is not the best.</Text>

Starbucks pastries are fantastic, but their coffee so-so except for their /Starbucks Cold Brew with Almondmilk, plant-based protein, almond butter, Banana Date Fruit Blend and ice.  Now,  Peet's needs a protein LOW sugar drink also, yes?</Review><response>None</response><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1547249583480< /date>< Name>

<review>Fantasic cold brew coffee. I ride my bike to this location once or twice a week to get out of the house and bring my laptop to get some work done. I like this spot because I love the merry go round kids park with the little train across the way, the outdoor patio seating in the shade of a tall oak, clean bathrooms and good vibes. Plus my chiropractor is across the street, which is convenient. As an added bonus today the barista had a formidable handlebar moustache, which lends any coffee shop instant credibility. Ive met several clients here before and meetings always work well here.< /review>< response>

<review>If you like Coffee or tea, Peets is the best place hands-down in the Nut Tree or Premium Outlets. Coffee is brewed fresh every 30 minutes, the baristas hand-pull every shot, and the warm breakfast sandwiches are a great snack when you need a little something for breakfast/between meals. We've got a huge variety of beans and teas you can try, as well as your favorite cold and blended drinks when you want something sweet. I work here, so I can't comment on the service, but I will say that we do our best to help you pick the right drink if you've never been here before. If you have any questions, stop by in the evenings and say hello!< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
was there on Tuesday, 9/12/17, at 9:30am. I had a very unpleasant experience with the cashier (heavy set white woman) this was the second time I had an unpleasant experience with her. The first time was a week prior.  She appeared to be uncomfortable when she took my order and was talking down to me and answering me in a sort of rude way.  I don't know what the deal is..the only conclusion I can draw from it is that she may by uncomfortable around African Americans. I will not be going back ..and I will be telling my friends.  from  now on  I will make my own coffee.</Review>

I dont know whats up with this place policy lately regarding having dark roast readily available. I notice it quite a bit in the Bay Area but was surprised when the coffee guy said he can brew some just a minute. I avoid #starbunks as much as posible because they tote corporate policies. Been coming to Peets for years starting at the Berkeley spot on Rose n Vine going back to high school days. Sadly adding this place on the avoid as much as possible list too.</text>

if you lose your wallet here, do not expect the Peet's employees to help you at all. They will steal your cards, and when you call to ask about it, they hang up on you. This was a terrible experience and everyone should be aware. So rude</review>

Pete’s coffee blows doors on Starbucks. It’s always stronger, fresher, and much more of an enjoyable cup of coffee.< /Review>

<text>I believe Peet's Coffee sells the best coffee in vacaville. Starbucks doesn't even compare. All the baristas are polite, and one time I wasn't able to afford my drink and the barista was kind enough to cover the 50 cents I couldn't provide. Not only are the employees polite, the drinks are delicious.< /text><Rate>5</Rate><pictures>None< /pictures>< UserId.>

Would be 5 stars if rate was $129 instead of $169 with the shape it was in today.

Great track, hard but fair. I'd play it again. 148 slope from back tees bring your driver.</Text>

< Review>
The course is fine, a little tricky with greens not consistently taken care of. Some have longer grass others shorter. Also, the course seem to be beaten up and doesn’t make an impression of PGA level course. We were disappointed compare to other courses we played in the area. Especially with rates around $200 per player. It is definitely worth of experiencing once. I can speak to the PGA west Stadium Course only.<//Review>

Beautiful course, but not welcoming to women golfers. I have played here twice, and both times the starter greeting the men in the group (“welcome sir”) and walked the men through the logistics (all with “sirs”), and not once acknowledged me or my presence despite sitting closer to the starter than the men in my group. He literally had to talk past me. It was weird and disappointing.< /Text>

The course was under going maintenance while we were in town.  The conditions weren't perfect but we got a really good deal. it was an extremely difficult course but well worth it.</Review>

I don't play golf, but I was there for the Eric Dickerson event. it truly is one of the loveliest courses I have ever seen. I have seen a lot. I also do the Mercedes Benz golf classic photography. The staff is awesome! So friendly and helpful. Course is clean and carts where actually very nice as well. As for the golfing, that's on you.< /Review>< Pictures>

Awesome golf course. This course is a great challenge. The fairways are hilly but well kept. There are deep deep bunkers  that are tough to play out of. The greens are awesome. This is one of my favorite courses. I highly recommend playing here. Thanks.</Text>

I don't play golf so can't give an opinion on the course. I was there for the Desert Classic concert series.  The place certainly looked lovely. They had everything well set up. The parking area was quite a distance away from the entry gate but there were lots of shuttles. There were plenty of volunteers to give directions and take your tickets. the line up for security moved quickly & the staff seemed t know what they were doing. Lot of walking involved to get from the entry over to the stage area. Wouldn't recommend for the infirm. The concert was great & Sammy Hagar and The Circle rocked!</text>

<text>Sammy Hagar was fantastic, getting to the venue a joke!  Next year let concert goers know you have to walk a mile (or more) to the venue.  Then an invalid can decide whether they can make it work or not, as there were no options provided.

<review>Perhaps no other golf architect can call on such a repertoire of design ideas and golf course defences as Pete Dye. Here at PGA West's Stadium course he seems to have deployed them all, making this one of the toughest layouts around; a worthy venue for the many top level professional tournaments it has hosted. Classic Peter Dye at his most challenging best.</review></record></dataset><record>

It was the typical antiquated snooty/waspy attitude that I'd rather do without. I booked well in advance and allowed a reasonable time gap to make my flight comfortable. There was a Frida delay, which I understand, but I could wait the amount a time they asked without missing my flight. All of that is just what is possible. The attitude of the gentleman at the front desk however was contrite and disconnected. He couldn't care less about my experience and was quick to discuss me and move on to one of the "members" who he catered to in a much different tone. I like to play the more notable and demanding courses when I travel. This was far and away the most regrettable experience of any of those courses. I will never waste my time with any of the courses at this facility. It's a shame because it's nice course and we like to visit the desert, but the people ultimately define the experience.<//Review>< Resp>

5 stars for how well maintained the course is. Also 5 stars for the service. 0 stars for enjoyment. If you're not a scratch golfer, avoid like the plague. Save yourself the very expensive green fees. It's a beautiful course with great staff. But unless you're really good or enjoy frustration, go elsewhere for your golfing fun. Golf is hard enough without all the excessive Pete Dye bull crap.</Review>

If you can believe I found them at Wal-Mart, so you know they didn't cost an arm and a leg...they have rods that you can put inside the window frame and our electricity bill was almost cut in half because of the shades...we have a new general manager and assistant, they are really doing a fantastic job, you can see where the H.O.A money is going first time in many years. Thank you Loni and Maria and our new gardeners, as well as the rest of the staff.<//review>< GmapID>

Nice course, beautiful scenery, horrible management.  This place is all about the money.  You'll be stacked up with 2-3 foursomes per hole, and end up waiting 5-10 minutes for every shot.  Make sure you start your round early enough, or you won't finish in the day light.  Will never play this dump again.< /Review>

<Text>Played this PGA tour course about a month ago, might as well shut down for the summer guys! Was THE WORST condition course I have ever played! Greens aren't green they are dirt, was not warned by the staff about how bad it was. Quit after only 9 holes.</Text>< Pics>

Our experience with All Pet Care Clinic has always been positive.  They are true professionals from appointment setting to intake to review of exam and expected treatments.  During the change in routines, they adapted well and have been appropriately giving care to our animals.  Our family feels blessed to have Dr. Sanders and her team in our lives.< /text>

All Care is great! I take my turtle to Dr. Sanders and she's so great! Friendly and knowledgeable staff, always super clean environment, and good pricing and hours. I want to switch my dog over, too! Definitely recommend if you have an exotic or just need to find a new vet. 10/10</review>

<Review>We recently purchased a puppy that contracted Parvo All Care Pet Clinic was compassionate and professional. They are even great with stressed, tired and emotional owners. They are the reason we were able to nurse my 9 week old puppy back to being healthy. Rocky still has a little way to go before a full recovery but without the caring doctors and staff our puppy wouldn’t have survived.</Review></record>

I feel very confident in taking my dogs to All Care Pet Clinic because the staff is friendly and caring. I ask questions and get specific responses and many times additional information in caring for my dogs, which I am always grateful for.  I never feel rushed by the staff , they never sound impatient, they are very professional. Even during these uncertain times All Care Pet Clinic is going out of its way to continue to provide service and care for our pets.<//Review>

<Review>This vet clinic is an amazing place, from the cari g doctors to the front desk you know walking in the door your pet is in great hands. Dr Chandler is one amazing vet, she takes her time evaluating your pet and running all necessary tests to put you at ease. They are reasonable and never over charge or do a procedure just to make more money. Would absolutely recommend this vet to anyone and do.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Sanders is hands down the worst vet I've encountered. Never called to give test results, then when I called, she never would call back. Shame on you!!!

No, I will not call you.  My dog died and Sanders is rude.  I pay for tests to be run and she is to lazy to call me with the results? That's not how you run a business. I could say a few more things, but I'll keep it to myself.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>The Dr. and staff are so kind and caring. When I had to euthanize my little Chihuahua, they got me right in, were quiet and sympathetic, and even wrapped her in a baby blanket after it was done. My last memory of her will always be cradled in a blanket. Thank you.< /Review>< Pics>

Fantastic!!!! I had been taking my dogs to pets r us and mission pet hospital and received horrible care. I brought my dog Winter to All Care Pet Clinic after I had been to Mission spending close to $500 for substandard care. All Care Pet Clinic saw my Winter same day as she was lethargic and visibly distressed. They ran tests, gave her the right meds and put her on  special food. A day later my dog was back to normal. They brought my dog back to life. I thought I was saving money going elsewhere but that was not the case. They actually care about your pet and it shows in their staff. Will continue to use them for both me dogs!!!well worth the money.<//review>

I have taking in my English bulldog numerous times. Each time I’ve had great experiences. The ladies at the front desk are so kind and very welcoming to my dog. The Dr and vet assistants answer all my questions and showed me how to take care of my dogs needs. Recently my dog had entropion surgery, this is the first time I’ve ever had a dog that needed surgery before.They did a great job on my dog and the recovery process was easy due to the fact that they explained everything and answered all my phone calls when I had an questions. I highly recommend this place.<//review>

We have several fur children that the caring staff takes care of at All Care Pet Clinic. They always know how to calm them down when we take them in even if it's just for a check up. The staff always makes sure you understand what's going on and how to take care of your pet when you take them home.
If your looking for a great team that will love your animals as much as you do then go to All Care Pet Clinic!!!</review>

Genuinely love this place. The prices are fair and there isn’t that long of a wait. The people are respectful! I send all my friends here<//text>

Nice place, competent and caring staff, however, they only do surgery on Thursday which means it takes a month to book a spay or neuter.  Baffled by the new policy and I can’t imagine that’s a good business model.<//review>

I took my tortoise here to get a burr removed from his eye. Poor guy. The staff here were quick, courteous, and professional. They had him fixed right up no problem!< /text>

<text>An absolutely phenomenal practice. They took great care of my cat and made him very comfortable in his last week, and when he needed to be put down I was out of state :( so one of the techs allowed my friend who brought him in, to use her phone so that we could video chat with our sweet boy. They are all so compassionate and their prices are the best I've seen. I never would have been able to afford what my cat needed at another clinic. The staff here go the extra mile and I cannot stress how kind, caring, and wonderful they all are.

Highly recommend this clinic!!<//text>< username>

We started going to All Care Pet Clinic about 3 years ago when we moved to the AV.  All of our pets ( 2 cats and a dog). Our puppy of 4 months just got spayed and she has been doing great. The staff (Jessica and Lupe) there are very nice and thorough. The prices are fair and the vaccine clinic is great too. The techs and doctors provide as much information as you need and are very detailed.  They have not let us down and I don’t expect they will. Totally recommend them for pets of all ages.</Review>

<rating>2<//rating><review>I wanted to like this place so much. While it is super clean, and the staff are friendly, I just couldn't get over the long wait times and the fact that they only have 2 exam rooms. I went to this place a handful of times hoping my experience would be better than the last, but everytime I waited for almost an hour past my appointment time. Since both exam rooms were always occupied, the assistants came out to discuss my pet's issues and personal information in the front waiting area for all to hear. I think this is kind of unprofessional. Also, I've been to a few other vets in the area and All Care's prices are quite high in comparison. I unfortunately won't be returning here.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Small place, but they do a really great job with what they have.  Vets are nice and generally knowledgeable, however we did once have to ask about testing for something that turned about to be positive, which the vet originally dismissed.  Overall a good vet clinic which we continue to use as our primary option for our dogs.<//Review>

<text>All Care Pet Clinic is wonderful. The entire staff is so very friendly and caring.  They helped us through a very difficult time with such compassion.  Dr. Sanders and Dr. Chandler were wonderful. Tech Victoria made my heart melt with her love of animals and her job.  Lupe and Jessica were great to interact with at the front desk, they were also very concerned about our pets. I received a lot of calls checking up on our hounds over the week or so to see how they were doing. It was so nice to know they cared.  After a lot of heroic measures from the staff and the difficult decision on our part of letting  our girl go, receiving a staff-signed condolence card meant so much.
Needless to say, I highly recommend All Care Pet Clinic.  ( :    <3< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

My new pom puppy had gotten into something and was diagnosed with toxic exposure at 10 weeks old.
There expertise and quick actions saved her life.
I'm very greatful they were able to take her in when or regular very was closed.
I would wholeheartedly recommend them and I have many times since. Zoey is now 3 years old and doing just fine.< /text>

<review>All Care Pet Clinic is the only place I can 100% recommend.  When we moved here, I had one dog and three cats. I was lucky enough to get a recommendation to them. I am forever grateful. They  have been there to help me and the babies transition. They have been through a tumor/cancer diagnosis with my dog and ultimately sat on the floor with him and I  when I had to make the hard decision to let him go. They cried right along with me. They've went through the process of trying to diagnosis one of my cats who had been through a gamut of tests and was never fully diagnosed. They stood by me while I made difficult decisions for the baby and smiled as we saw him through another 5+ years of good, sassy living. They were the ones who were by my side during that difficult loss as well.  Then again with my almost 20 year old fur baby girl when it was her time and again with my last kitty. They knew each of them, their temperament, personalities and  challenges. They have been there for my new rescue baby boy (dog) and have provided amazing care. They have taken care of my newest pup (1 year old in May), who I met in their waiting area while getting her 5 week shots with her litter mates. Kismet!  They have also assisted,supported, encouraged and given of time, energy and effort beyond what's "required" in the care of my now 18 red ear slider turtles, from babies to 7 to 10 year old adults, from upper respiratory infections to metabolic bone disease. I have learned so much from them, as people would leave their turtles in or near my pond on a regular basis for a while. In case you can't tell, I absolutely love  these folks, from the receptionists, to the techs, to the docs! They are a group of wonderful people in the business for all the right reasons.  Do yourself a favor and take your babies to someone who cares and that is most definitely these peeps!  Thank you to my wonderful Peeps at All Care Pet Clinic!  Me and "the crew" adore all of you!  Huge Hugs for all you do for us and all the others.<//review>< user>

This office is so Friendly. I had remembered Victoria from my previous visit. Puppy is not a dog that likes new faces but when she met Victoria they became Friends in 5 minutes.
We were so scared for Puppy and the diagnosis..
But the Dr. put my fear to rest as we caught thie Pyometra in time. Now its just the 2 weeks with the "Cone of Love" (not shame ).
We are Blessed to have found these Amazing People.</Text>

I started bringing my dog here almost a year ago, and I am so happy I did. Scheduling appointments is easy and they have been able to schedule during times that work for me. I have seen 2 different vets there and was happy with the care we got each time.

I also love the piece of mind I get for knowing they are open 7 days a week!< /text>< username>

We used All Care Pet Clinic on May 05, 2019, after my Boxer had passed away.  Our regular Vet was closed for the weekend and they suggested on the voice greeting that we use them.

I called their office, devastated over the fact we just lost a member of our family.  Since this was our first pet death, I didn't know where to start or what to ask, but the person over the phone was very friendly and helpful.  She first asked when did I want to bring her in and they were more then accomidating with us wanting to bring her immediatly that afternoon.  They went over my options and prices over the phone for what we wanted her to have done.

We were asked to call when we arrived and they met us in the back of the building. They had us sign some paperwork and told us that they were sorry for our loss.

After all this was done and paid for, they even called my regular Vet who reached out to me to tell me how sorry they were that this happened.  I really appreicated that.

I would not only use them again for pet cremation, but would take my other fur babies to see them if our regular vet is ever closed.  All of their staff were super nice to me and even when I went to pick up my baby in her new box, they again said they were sorry for my loss.< /text>

<Text>After several UNACCEPTABLE AND NEGLIGENT EXPERIENCES at PET'S R US I needed to find a veterinarian who's staff was experienced enough to be the go-between in regards to my cat's new diagnosis of diabetes. The staff, technicians and obviously the doctor, are all well qualified at this facility.
As a certified veterinary assistant myself I know an inexperienced staff when I have an exchange with them (such as was the case at Pets r Us)! If you are looking for a low-cost, high-quality Veterinary Center All Care pet clinic is definitely a wise choice for your pets needs.<//Text>< Pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I've been bringing my 6 year-old cocker spaniels to All Care ever since they were puppies. Dr. Sanders and Dr. Chandler are always great about answering all my questions and are very patient with my dogs, who tend to be shy around other people. The techs are also all great, patient and gentle with my dogs. A few years ago, one of my dogs had a severe double infection, and had to be kept at the clinic for a day for tests. One of the techs earned her trust and my little dog looked to her for comfort the entire day. The other techs told me how that tech had grown attached to my dog, and it made me feel so much better knowing she had been in such good hands during such a scary time. I haven't felt the need or desire to look for another vet; I trust the staff at All Care with the wellbeing of my precious furry family members.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been going to All Care for about 3 years now. They are amazing with my pooches and always so friendly and caring. My Roxy will always let Victoria clip her nails and draw blood which is a big deal! Im very thankful for all they have done for my babies!< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><username>Angela Perez</username><text>I called to get some information on prices for x-rays on my dog that ate something the person on the phone was rude and not very  good about translating information from the doctor. I explained the situation to her she said she would call me back because she needed to speak to the doctor. She called me back and immediately told me i needed to bring him in for surgery i asked her how she knew my dog needed surgery without looking at him or taking x-rays she said thats what the doctor had said to her then i asked her on pricing for x-rays she had said $500 which is crazy to me i have never paid that much just for x-rays. At this point i will drive an hour to my vet i have gone to for many years they know what there doing there this place has people working for them that have no idea what there talking about and through the whole conversation she kept saying i don't know i'm fairly new here. Then why not get someone that knows what there doing.<//text>< rate>

I've known owner, Dr. Cheema, from Sears Veterinary for over 6 years and this 2nd location carries forward his mission of treating animals with love and care.
In a community that is often in the lower SES spectrum, their willingness to work with owners who may not be able to pay full fee is generous and appreciated.

High marks for All Care.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I took my dog Bowser to All Care.  He was extremely sick from an unknown cause.  Rather than inundate me with tests (and their inherent costs), they did only what seemed like the most likely causal testing.  I was very sad and felt like this was "the end" for Bowser - that's how sick he was.  The doctor gave me several options (including euthanasia), but I elected to leave him there for the day on fluids and medications.  It is now almost two weeks later and Bowser is much better!  I don't know if he's "cured" for good (he IS 11 years old now), but his quality of life is much better and we feel better too knowing that he got the kind of care he needed and is with us for some time longer!  I am very grateful to the doctor and staff of All Care!  If your a pet owner like me, you fear taking your family member to a vet that you are unfamiliar with.  I can, with good conscious, tell you that you can rest assured that if you take your pet to All Care, you will not be broke and your pet will get excellent care!!< /Text>< pictures>

I don't usually write reviews, but these people are different. Took my 7 month old kitty Panthera to get spayed, I was super nervous and the caring atmosphere from the nurse at the desk helped calm me, they took extremely good care of my princess, even called home to see how she was doing, and with there prices so affordable (we ended up paying 106 but got her rabbies shot and take home box), not including the extras that come with it (while other clinics charge over a 100 for the spaying this is the only clinic I found that gives you take home medication and collar plus other stuff) friendly staff, excellent service, and really care about the people and our furry best friends</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) My Good pet care. Very professional. In addition to being a general animal clinic. Which very, very few clinics have this service. My cobayita Chloe was very well looked after. Now I just hope he recovers. 100% recommendable.

Great salon, everyone is very friendly. Sandy does amazing Dip for my nails, and they always make time for you even though it sometimes gets very busy. I've tried many salons in the area but this is the best one.< /Review>

Worse experience I have had for manicure... Normally you would expect fresh tools opened up in front of you, but not here. Lots of dust on a table and items. The job was very very poor. I am never coming back to this place. Service didn’t meet the expectations that you are paying for.</Text>

< Review>
I went to this salon for several years and had my nails done by Lien. She does an excellent job, is very detail oriented and creative. I always had nail design and she went with whatever I wanted. My polish and design were flawless even after 6(!) weeks, my nails just grew out so I had to get a fill.
I am moving out of state and I only regret that I can’t take Lien with me.
They make an effort to know and greet you with your name when you come in, not like other places where they don’t bother.
Highly recommended!!!</Review>

Lien does amazing gel manicures, takes time precisely cleaning your cuticles and the quality/effort placing the Polish is worth it. You will NOT be disappointed! P.S. she even does eyebrow waxing herself -unlike all the other salons you've been to where they send you to a different lady, so impressed!< /Text>

< review>
Only pro: the staff were super friendly and spoke great English
Cons: The lady doing my nails somehow cut my pinky (below the nail) with her file and didn't apologise, kept coating it with something that hurt a LOT (probably alcohol-based).
She also didnt paint as close to my nail base as possible, and the day after the polish is already starting to come off at my tips (even though its gel). Its very unevem at the base - see the pics. I think my nail technicians name was Kim.< /review>

<review>This is my first time coming here since I needed my nails done that exact day and my regular shop was unable to get me scheduled. For starters I got charged $46 for a refill. Now I don't mind paying more if the quality is going to be good (I normally pay $29). I asked to have my nails round shap but it seemed as though he didn't know what he was doing. All my nails are different lengths and I was there for at least 1 hour. He was really slow and kept hurting or making my nail burn. I wont be coming back again.<//review></record>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I asked if I could come at 7 with two friends. They asked if I could come at 6:30 instead, so I made the appointment for then. We got here at 6:30. It's now 7:15 and they haven't started my nails yet. They actually started my friend who is just getting a pedicure. I'm getting a gel manicure and regular pedicure and the other person is getting regular mani pedi.

Update: 50 mins after I got here, they're just starting my nails.

Update 2: 1 hour 10 mins in, they're just starting the 3rd person's toes

Update 3: 1 hour 30 mins in, they're starting on the 3rd person's nails

Last update: it's past 8pm and they're still doing my friend's nails. They're asking the other two of us to pay now since they want to go home. My guy kept turning around to look at the TV while painting my nails. One of the ladies blamed the long wait on one late client. The owner was there, but he just sat around the entire time, so it seems like this is normal.

I obviously will not be back.<//review>< pics>

They are... excellent. Every time I go there, they do a fantastic job. These ladies take pride in their work, and it shows. Hands down the best pedicure I have ever received. And they are very skilled with doing dip manicures.</Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>I highly recommend this place. At 47 years old and having been away from fitness routines in decades, I’ve found a gym (Gem). The staff carefully evaluated my workout techniques to prevent injuries, challenged without overwhelming me, and has an atmosphere suitable for families. Their nutritionist has also provided excellent guidance to develop sustainable healthy eating habits. Look no further, they’re the real deal. I can feel the progress after only 2 weeks!</review>< username>

RegenX is a huge part of why at my age 35 I’m now in the best shape of my life. I came to them at 235 lbs at around 27% body fat. After 3 months I’m down to 197 lbs at about 18% body fat.
The coaches are all real kind and take a personal interest in each and everyone there. The guide you through every class and challenge you without jeopardizing your physical health.
Joining RegenX is the best decision I’ve ever made. I wish I would’ve done it way sooner.<//Review>

This is a great place to get fit. They give individual attention when you need it. They coach you the whole way through while encouraging and constructively pushing you every step of the way. The coaches here aren't telling you to do something that they, themselves, would not participate in doing. They are well experienced and they really inform you about every exercise movement you make. It is like a family environment and everyone cheers each other on to be the best you can be.< /review>

I love Carson CrossFit. The workouts are fun & challenging, the coaches are energetic & talented, and the community is supportive & friendly. Since starting, my posture has improved & my energy has increased, and I generally feel like a healthier & happier version of myself. This is a special place, and I would recommend folks to try it out, no matter their fitness level. The coaches are very gifted at working with people to make sure the workouts work for them.<//Text>

<Review>Amazing gym and amazing coaches! They make every effort to ensure you meet all your fitness goals. Gemma and Justin check in on me and make sure that I continue to come and stay committed. I’ve met so many great people and enjoy coming to work out at the end of my day. I look great and feel great and it’s all because of Carson CrossFit.

This place is the best part of my day. I'm so thankful for the coaches and members who have welcomed me into their family and pushed me to progress everyday! 10/10 would recommend anyone try out our crazy family.</Review>

<text>I thought it would be hard to transition to a different gym because I came from a pretty awesome place. I am picky about the coaching and programming and I'm happy to say that Carson CrossFit has been successful in both. The coaches are really knowledgeable and they know what they're doing; they are organized and can control the flow of classes really well.
It's easy to say that I respect all of the coaches at Carson CrossFit. All the coaches there really want you to progressed and become the better version of yourself.
They always have different events and activities going on - this keeps it fresh and exciting! They host different in-house competitions, fun challenges, and other fun activities for family and friends. They really care about their members and constantly work to make it a better place.
Another great thing about Carson CrossFit are the people. The environment is contagious and hard to be away from. It's great to be around other work horses and people that just want to work to get better. Everyone is welcoming and has a great attitude. I definitely enjoy the diversity.
I'm extremely happy that this is a gym that I decided to transition to since we had to relocate from our other gym.
Without a doubt, you should definitely come visit Carson CrossFit and all it has to offer!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Carson Crossfit is my second home. We are all a family here- we push each other, support each other and laugh together. This gym is also very holistic, covering everything from nutrition to mental toughness to overall fitness. Any goal you have will be supported. I highly recommend!</Review>

Joining Carson Crossfit may have been one of the best decisions I’ve made. The coaches are knowledgeable and pay attention to details so that you improve with each class. Also, the gym members are so friendly and welcoming that there wasn’t room left for me to feel insecure as a newbie. Carson CF continues to push me to be the best version of me, and I’m here to stay!< /text>

Been coming to this gym for about an year, not as consistently as I would have liked, but whenever I can make it the coaches make it easy for me to jump right in. It is truly a family environment with lots of encouragement and support. I also appreciate that they maintain their gear and upgrade in appropriate intervals. Check it out, you won't be disappointing.</review>

I don't even know how to thank you guys enough for what you have done to me emotionally, mentally and physically. I would've never thought I'd be looking this good again after my daughter. The nutrition coaching w Gemma, the coaches AJ, Adam, Justin you guys are so awesome. This has become not only a place for keeping myself fit and strong but has become a place to keep me sane. I found a family at this gym.

I LOVE everyone here!! Thank you guys for all that you do!!< /text>

<text>I am very Happy that I joined back in May 2018. I do the Reform Program mostly (there is many programs that would fit your needs) but this program worked better for me. I was 220 lbs, tired all the time, and unhappy with my body look. After almost a year in a half, I can tell you that I am at my best physically, and mentally, I feel better, healthier, and strong. on May 2019 I decided to join their nutrition program, I learned how to eat healthier, balanced, and keep track of what I put in my body, and it made a big change on me, cutting down my body fat percentage. I am 180 lbs now, from size XL shirts to Medium , and pants size 38 to 33!, nutrition played a big part of my changed. Btw The coaches are great, very Healthful and knowledgeable, and the whole community overall is very welcoming, thank you Carson Crossfit!</text><Response>None< /Response>< pictures>

I tried a class at Carson CrossFit and was immediately hooked. The workouts were a perfect combination of challenging and exciting. Even when the workout got hard, the ambiance just made it so easy to keep going. The sense of community was overwhelming and I felt like part of the family immediately. Everyone was genuinely interested in my physical goals and has been hyping me up every time I reached one.

I never thought I’d like CrossFit but its been a year since I took that first class and I still look forward to my next session! Special thanks to Justin, Gemma, AJ, and JC for all your help and dedication in making this place so damn awesome!< /text>

I very much enjoy Carson Crossfit. Justin, AJ and Nick are fantastic coaches. Each of them provide specific and helpful feedback on lifting techniques as well as providing me positive and motivating feedback on my growth as an athlete. There is a strong sense of community and a lot of positivity that resonates through teach class that is taught. The gym is always getting new equipment and the box is always clean! Would recommend to anyone!< /Review>

I know everyone gives their home gym 5 stars but they genuinely deserve it. Over the past few years, I've gone to a number of crossfit gyms that have been overpriced, unwelcoming, too small and even lacking in equipment. Over the year that I have been at CC I feel supported by a community oriented group of staff and members alike. It's not intimidating in the slightest, great camaraderie with people of varying fitness levels and a no judgement zone feel. Some coaches have different specialties and are open to questions. Plenty here to do including friendly competitions and fitness challenges.  Thanks you guys!< /review>

<Review>5.5 years with Carson Crossfit and would not change it for a regular gym ever. I will continue here. I loved it so much that I've brought my son (now 26y,  medical school student, New York) and daughter (21y, Down Syndrome) as well, and they continued training with me ever since; my daughter always with me, 3 times/week, and my son whenever with us or on his own (crossfit, sailing).

I've started crossfit there initially in a fitness program open by the company for which I presently work, Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR), for 3.5 months. Loved it so much, lost 10 lbs and gained strength and endurance, that I've decided to continue with them, and not another program or regular gym. After the initial 3.5 months, UPRR was not decided to continue or not to pay for us at Carson Crossfit; therefore, I've paid from my won pocket and continued the workout with my kids as well. Finally, UPRR decided to pay in full crossfit sessions for all employees who wanted to enroll and, since, they paid for me and my daughter, which was great. Nevertheless, should they stop, I'd restart personal payments and continue the crossfit workout, especially at Carson Crossfit.

A few reasons:

The only routine is the group itself that shares the same workout with you, and that there is a trainer present all the time. Otherwise, exercises change every single day, which keep you motivated, active and in shape for new training opportunities

Every single routine has not only one type of exercise, but a combination of weight lifting, gymnastics and cardio - can you easily beat that?

Many times routines determine you to use your own body weight - so you start to know yourself a little better

Staff: professional, trained, pays attention to individual needs; addresses personal requests; advises all the time possible

Group: hardworking, funny, respectful, celebrates and acknowledges results

Last but not least: once a year you have the opportunity to participate in an open contest world-wide in your age group to see how well you are and/or how much more work you'd still want do, or preserve what you've gained. Last year, not being present in US, I have participated from vacation in Romania with my son in the open, and I-T W-A-S G-R-E-A-T!

Try Carson Crossfit as well! :) By the way, the picture attached is from my birthday short celebration at Carson Crossfit, after the workout.</Review><user_id>114222224572602370502</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I have never been the biggest fan of crossfit gyms. I was introduced to this one because my old strength and conditioning gym closed down and a lot of the members gave this gym a try. I was intimidated by how everyone appeared to be more advanced than my current position, but the reason I stayed is the ambience of the gym and the coaches, owners, and athletes alike. Everyone is friendly. The coaches show great concern on your well being and fitness journey. Every time I have addressed a goal or a certain concern, the coaches go out of their way to help me get there. They always go above and beyond. I am extremely thankful for the type of family I am gaining from this gym. I have several body issues - one of the most consist one is my hip. I almost always seem to be injured and it's a little discouraging because I would have to go lighter, or sometimes it is too much and I can't always catch up with the other people in class. What I really appreciate, however, is that the coaches are always ready to help modify WODs to fit my current circumstance. They have given me pointers, addressed videos, and went well out of their way to try to resolve my consistent hip issue. It has really motivated me to work better on my form, knowing that once I have gotten that down... the strength portion will come back. During the work outs, everyone motivates another. We start together, we end together. So whether or not this will be your first time at a [crossfit] gym or your millionth time, CCF is an amazing place to go. You really build a family. 10/10 recommend!!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>Since Day one I was hooked, been a member for little bit over three years. Started out @ 250, back problems and also suffer from Asthma. I have dropped over 60 pounds and no longer have any back issues and my Asthma is under control. The coaches here are Awesome always working with you making sure you are doing the movements properly so that you don't get injured and helping you achieve your own personal goals. All the staff is very welcoming and helpful and the vibe in the gym is awesome with the members also being very friendly and helpful to one another and very supportive of each other helping and pushing each other. I would highly recommend Carson Crossfit to anyone to come in an try it out.  I am now in my early 40's and I feel AWESOME and I owe all to my supportive wife and Daughter and my Carson Crossfit  Family becuase when you come here it feels like home.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
There are a lot of things I consider when choosing a permanent place to do workouts and I hope this gives you an idea of why I love CCF.

FRIENDLINESS:
I started coming here when my former CrossFit Gym closed, and I was skeptical that I would find comfort starting over in a new environment. I was pleasantly surprised how welcoming everyone is - I've been to many boxes where no one says hi, or acknowledges you until you say something. As soon as you walk in the door, you'll get a "what-up" or "hi" from at least one person.

COACHING:
This is why you want to go to a CrossFit Gym and growing with all the members at CCF. Coaches go over each movement and take everything step by step - they continually work on perfecting your movements and you will definitely see results in lifting by strategizing each WOD. All the coaches work on elevating their credentials to better serve the members by attending seminars, certification courses, and growing with everyone.

EQUIPMENT/SPACE:
The facility is always progressing, whether by renovation, new equipment, or having sponsors bring gear for special events. There's always something going on the calendar. There is plenty of space along with top-notch equipment that makes this a place to be proud of. Each section is geared towards a special purpose, and it never feels crowded during WODs. A welcoming lobby with snacks and recovery drinks fulfills everyone's needs after a tough workout, and it never disappoints to satisfy - I find myself getting something almost every day.

COMRADERIE:
This really makes or breaks a quality gym - by the people you see every day. Everyone is super nice and non-intimidating, which makes me want to come 5 days a week. This truly is the best hour of my day (aside from spending time with my family). Humility mixed with bumping music and max effort from each member makes a pretty awesome day.

BOTTOM LINE:
Drop in! You won't regret it!</Review>

<review>I have been a member of Carson Crossfit for over three years. Recently Carson Crossfit has gotten new owners, and has had some major improvements to the gym. Ive been a loyal client to this gym because its not just a place to workout, but its a place where you can make long lasting relationships and be surrounded by supportive people. Which is ultimately what pushes you to be a greater athlete.

Coach Justin and Coach AJ are amazing, as well as the other coaches, and Justin's wife Gemma.
The staff is dedicated to you meeting your goals whether it be to improve in weightlifting (Barbell), get better at cardio (Reform class), Crossfit, and they even have a yoga class and challenge to help you lose weight and get toned. Justin and AJ are really good at showing people the proper technique to lifting correctly and staying injury free. If you’re looking for a new gym, or your first gym, this is the place to go!! There are members ranging from 15 years old to people who are much older, every workout is scaled down to what YOU can do. The gym is spacious, has drinks for sale, protein bars, complete cookies, its very well maintained, they have a womens and mens bathroom, as well as a bathroom with a shower in case you wanna workout before work or school. They also do hikes, crossfit  competitions, and weightlifting meets.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Lubricator care is required.

The price is fine but it's not managed ..

You need to clean up.

There is a car wash.

This is where diesel is sold.

The parking lot is wide and convenient for parking.

(Original)
주유기 관리가 필요합니다.

가격은 괜찮은데 관리가 안되고 있네요..

깨끗하게 정리가 필요합니다.

세차장이 있습니다.

디젤을 판매하는 곳입니다.

주차장이 넓어 주차하기 편합니다.<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Easily the worst of the top three shipping companies.  After a few days of delayed deliveries with no service alerts or explanations, companies really need to quit using Ontrac for deliveries.  I'm not sure how a company like this exists in the service industry.

It seems like UPS, USPS, or even Amazon are the best options.  I'll just start refusing packages shipped via Ontrac and shop at competitors that don't use their service and recommend others do the same.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

4/5. For how bad their reputation is the six time I have gotten packages from them these past few months they havent failed me once . I was worried but they have came through every time and they are the only carriers I have seen on my camera that don't slam my package. They actually lay it down. I would give them five stars but their employees seem to not wear masks so that one star off.< /Review>

I hate when companies ship my package with OnTrac, and thankfully it's not often. I had a package from Google delivered on Tuesday. The driver buzzed me on the call box and I buzzed them into the building. I'm on the first floor, so it shouldn't take too long to get to my door. I then got a message from Google that my package was delivered, so I checked the tracking and it said delivered to "mail room". We don't have a mail room. The mailboxes are just inside the door and there are big bold signs stating not to leave packages there due to theft. I ran down to the mailbox and thankfully my package was still there, but the blatant disregard for people's packages to leave them in an area that specifically states not to is a different type of lazy.<//Text>

- fill out the change of address form on the site to use a dropbox or hold it at the warehouse
- call immediately and wait on hold for an hour to have them say they'll try
- it goes on the truck the next day and never arrives
- I call again the next morning, but it's already on the truck again
- they finally hold it at the warehouse, and I drive 20 miles to go pick up my package that should have arrived 2 days prior (and this is ALWAYS after paying a premium for overnight because I actually need the item quickly)</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Wish I could give ZERO stars! This is by FAR the worst delivery service EVER! They clearly state that business deliveries will be made by 5pm. The driver attempted purposely at 830pm, 730pm, and 630pm. And now they say, I have to pick up the package myself and there's nothing they can do about it. This is so ridiculous. Never use this service and I dont see how they are still even in business. Total FALSE ADVERTISING!!! SCAM COMPANY!< /Text>

<text>DON'T USE THESE CLOWNS! I ordered two items from the Google Store. On 11/20 received notification from OnTrac that they would be delivered on 11/21. OnTrac tracking said they were delivered in the afternoon of 11/21. They were not delivered. I contacted OnTrac several times over the next few days. On 11/27 OnTrac sent me an email saying they found my packages, they were (again) out for delivery and would be delivered to my business address by the end of the day. At 6:00 pm I tracked the package and it said the packages were out for delivery. I began attempting to contact OnTrac. At about 7:30pm I was told by an OnTrac "Service" Agent that the packages were claimed "delivered" at 3:11pm. They were not delivered. I again checked "tracking" the delivery status was changed to "delivered".  DON'T USE THESE CLOWNS!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Why would Amazon chose this company?? I have had UPS and USPS deliver packages and they have always came by the time they scheduled. Most of the times earlier! First time having this company deliver and they deliver a package almost at 10pm. I live in the AV and they seem to fail a lot with this area. They need to stick closer to the valley.
I ordered three things from Amazon and they were to be shipped in two separate packages. One was delivered by USPS and it was delivered in the two day window as it was scheduled. That package came from Ohio. The second is from Fontana and it didn't even start to move until the second morning, meaning it took one full day to just start the order. USPS dropped off my package on the second day by 2pm, which is when they typically arrive but the site said it would arrive by 8pm. OnTrac said that it was sent to Sun Valley by 7am and was then out for delivery by 1pm. I thought that was plenty of time to make the trip and figured the driver had other deliveries and 8pm was not too bad.
8pm rolls around and I start to get impatient but wait it out until 8:30 before I call. The representative says the drivers have a grace period until 9pm to get the package out. So again I wait. I am waiting in the living by the front door when my dog begins to bark. I look out the window to a white box truck. I assumed it was OnTrac but I waited to see how the package would be delivered. They come up to the porch and throw it by the door! One of the items was an electronic and that's very unprofessional.
I am not sure if you can chose you will deliver for Amazon but I will make sure next time to pick if at all possible. And if you chose them to send a package willingly, I hope this review and the countless others guide you to a better business even if it might cost more. You will at least have a better experience.
I ONLY have it 2 stars as it was delivered the day it was scheduled. Even though it was two hours late and thrown.

Advise to OnTrac, maintain stability in certain areas before pushing to other locations that you are not capable of handling. The reviews don't lie.<//Text><time>1517638096339< /time>< user_id>

<Review>I ordered a gift for my granddaughter that I needed yesterday (she is leaving town today).  Had I known Amazon was going to ship OnTrac, I would not have ordered! The odds are 90% of the time OnTrac mis-delivers the packages! Their drivers change often, are shady, and clearly cannot read house numbers (or directions). I have called Amazon and they have assured me that they have taken OnTrac deliveries OFF my account. We'll see. How does a business that is run so poorly stay in business??< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Ordered a package 2 weeks ago and it got shipped via this company. So far so good. I tracked the package online and 5 days ago it got into the Burbank facility - I checked online every day - it didn't get delivered any further. After calling the hotline 3 times, somebody picked up and told me that they probably lost the package in their own station. Nevertheless I drove there to find out what had happened to my package. At the OnTrac Burbank station however I got told, that the package is missing and that they can't do anything. They told me that I had to contact the company I ordered from and tell them to ship it again.
I wonder what would've happened if I hadn't called.. would I have never gotten a message, an update or anything? One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a shipping service.< /text>< Pics>

The absolute worst.  I would give them a zero if at all possible.  I got a text from Amazon today that my package was delivered to my office which is interesting since it is locked and no one was there.  Nonetheless, I ran by my office building to see if they maybe left it in the hall.  It was nowhere to be found.

Called the company when I got home, and Ontrac said it was delivered to "the front desk" which is pretty amazing since we were locked and don't even have a "front desk." (it is a two person office).  The guy I spoke to had no clue although he promised to call me back within a half hour (an hour ago, and I am still waiting).  I spoke to his supervisor who was rude, didn't want to let me speak and tried to shout over everything I was saying.  I truly hope that Amazon stops using this company.  They are horrendous and couldn't care less about the customer.< /review>

<Text>It is very rare to see a company with so many 1 star reviews and for that company to actually deserve those reviews. Usually the truth is somewhere in the middle. However, in this case, On-Trac deserves EVERY single one of those 1 stars. Over the past 24 hours, I have been on the phone 6 times with them, total call time has been over 3 hours, and the stress and headaches have been plentiful. So to start, the delivery driver was over 2 hours late. Then he apparently couldnt find the address so he just left! Yes you read that right. He didn't try to figure out where the location was, he just left and said that the recipient refused service on the tracking website. These are tires for my car. I have been driving on a donut, which is extremely dangerous. That is why I paid for expedited shipping. So after he left, there were 2 phone calls where common sense did not register with anyone on the other side. During the first call, around 1pm, I even offered to pick them up after work. She said this was not doable. Then after 2 more phone calls and around 6pm, they said the driver already went home for the day and the facility was closed! What?! He was supposed to call to rearrange the drop off. Jenivive, the supervisor in Arizona, is literally one of the worst supervisors I have ever dealth with. Absolutely zero common sense, accepts no responsibility and simply reads off a script. You are supposed to problem solve and be able to help the customer/rememdy the situation; not just say what is going to happen and repeat yourself. And she constantly enjoys interrupting you so she can say the same lines over and over again. There was a lot more in this situation but I dont feel it is necessary. You get the point. If you're not too concerned about the contents of your package or the punctuality of the delivery situation then go ahead and you won't be stressed out. Otherwise steer clear. There's a reason why there's so many bad reviews. If you want to know more details, let me know and I will complete this essay!<//Text>< Pics>

This place is the absolute worst!  I checked the package, it said it was undeliverable because they needed the gate code, but the intercom has the instructions on how to USE it on a screen, they didn't even try to use it (over the weekend I got a package from them, no problem them using it then, that's rare I know).  I called them, approximately 20 minutes after they tried to deliver it, they said they wouldn't redeliver it today and I'd have to wait until tomorrow (They have delivered packages LATER than 4pm).  This isn't the first time this has happened either.  Amazon really needs to drop this company like a bad habit, they are extremely unreliable.</Review>

Absolutely, positively, without exception the WORST delivery service on the planet. Drivers leave packages anywhere they feel like it away from the actual address and call it "delivered." When told to enter a 3 digit gate code like "345" to gain access to a secure apartment complex, the driver couldn't figure out how to push the 3 numbers on the keypad to ring the unit..and so didn't deliver the package in FOUR visits! If you have something supposedly coming via Ontrac, just figure you've got well less then a 50% chance you'll see it on time or at all.</review>

If I could rate this zero I would. There is no clear way to track my shipment,  I have no idea where my package is. I was supposed to get it yesterday but I guess no one was home or something so it said December 8, which is today. It's almost 9:00 pm and it still says my package is on the way. It would be helpful if it would show the locations of my package just like ups. Who knows maybe it's lost somewhere. I am VERY disappointed with this service. I've been trying to contact somebody forEVER and of course, nothing. When I call the customer service line to the automated voice to try and track my package, it just keeps ringing forever, didn't even ask to input my tracking number or anything. Like why am I on hold, who am I being transferred to? I am very dissatisfied with this service. I don't know why my package was shipped with this carrier, I would have loved it to be ups or even fedex.< /Text>

I alway get same day shipping from Amazon.  But Amazon uses this company to deliver my packages.  I live in a gated condo with a call box.  When they come, they see its gated and drive right by.  I know cause I have seen them do it.  Called customer service and told them to call the guy and tell him to come back and they said he will come back after all packages have been delivered. But that never happened!  Got my package 3 days later.  Amazon refunded my money and let me keep my package.  I don't know how Amazon still uses this company!< /text>

<Review>Amazon should not be giving these guys business. I was supposed to receive my package 3 days ago. I even left a note on the front door for the driver to call me but never got a call. The driver just noted that there was no gate code. When I called to file a complaint on my driver, the customer rep just said that they are not required to use their personal cell phones to call the customer. Well I'm pretty sure that he didn't even bother to walk up to the door. Who knows if he even drove to my place?!

On Trac should pay their drivers according to how many packages that get delivered successfully... clearly, their current system is not working. Will be filing a complaint with Amazon as well to not use their services.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Time>1536771587708< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>Slogan: "OnTrac. Because we've got the best reputation for the worst service. Period."

Our delivery driver is nice — for the most part — however, I also understand his predicament; attitude reflects leadership.

But that's not what this review is about. Simply put, OnTrac is on track (pun intended) for the worst delivery service period.

Constantly late? No problem.
Missed delivery dates? We've got you covered.
Destroyed breakables? That's our jam!

At least USPS arrives by the end of the work day. And that's saying a lot...a...lot.

Don't count on OnTrac to arrive at your residence with perishables on time either.

Does 9 PM work for you? Yeah because I absolutely looove my persishables sitting on a friggin' hot truck all day only to get to my doorstop by 9 PM when everyone is PTFO so it gets to sit outside all night long. Sounds great right? Yeah, no thanks.

Seriously though, what's the deal? Your main distribution hub in our area is a ~15 minute drive and it takes >12 hours to make a delivery of perishables?

Go back to the drawing board kids (we still have those right, drawing boards?) and rethink your business plan. While you're at it, upgrade your trucks so they don't look like they came straight from Slab City (no offense Slab City we still love your free spirits!)<//review>< pics>

I was surprised to see so much negative feedback, so I thought i'd post my experience. On 04/12/16 i placed a same day delivery order with Amazon. It was supposed to arrive by 9pm. Instead it arrived by 8pm. All my items arrived safely, and the packaging was undamaged. Overall good experience.< /Review>

I placed an order on Amazon and as soon as I saw ontrac as the deliverer.......i shook my head because they suck.... But one can only have hope. So I waited for my package on the delivery date but when it hit 2 and I didn't see my package in route I called and found out 3 hours later that my package could not be located even though the warehouse received it. Had to reorder and now I'm hoping any delivery company other than ontrac 😬< /Review>

I've had hundreds of packages delivered to me over the last 10 years -  and this is absolutely the worst company I've ever dealt with.  Consistently bad customer service, incompetent drivers who can't read directions or decipher how to dial an access code, let alone make a phone call.  If I could give zero stars I would!< /text>

<review>ive had two drop offs using amazon next day and so far so good. i took off one point because both times item was left downstairs unsecured outside the mailboxes instead of outside of my door on the next floor.i wouldn't complain about it if i trusted every person that walks by. if this is management putting too much pressure on their drivers then they need to hire more or not so lazy drivers. im sure they are losing money with all the bad reviews of missing packages.

Drivers lie about delivery attempts. They never even leave the vehicle. Crap company.

I work from home and am 10 feet from the gate that the delivery person supposedly attempted to make a delivery. I can hear footsteps down the quiet walk street.

This happens all the time with OnTrac at our building. All the other courier companies deliver her just fine, daily!

I am surprised that a company as good as Amazon even deals with such an inefficient lousy 'company'

I was able to track a package using the Amazon texting tracking method until it said it was delivered. I got the notification text as I was outside on my driveway. I Looked around for a delivery guy... nothing...Then to the mailbox.. nothing. Later that evening checked with my neighbor.. nothing. I contacted ontrac, they said it was delivered to the address. Not possible, no evidence. Even no surveillance of even a delivery person's truck passing by. Their solution is to wait a few days to see if it comes to my door then to contact the sender for reimbursement if it doesn't arrive. What the heck? That's it? That's their resonse? Terrible solution, absolutely terrible.</Text>

Driver stated leaving the package outside of the mail room, where the apartment doesn't have a dedicated mail room and the package is lost. After making me wait almost 40 mins on phone, Customer Service personnel says check with the seller and didn't care to provide any more details. Sounded too lazy and arrogant to provide any more information  where at least the package is dropped and gives free suggestion to claim insurance.<//Review>

<text>Absolute Morons!  I live one hour from the warehouse and they can't find my house.  A 5 year old with a smart phone can do their job of delivery!
About to dump Amazon Prime if they continue to use OnTrac as their delivery service.  3rd screw-up in 2 weeks.  Don't know what else to say about them except... Run away from them as fast as you can, use another company!  Also, one of my packages that finally made it had been opened up and a large piece was missing, definitely had piece in when sent, packing had molding for it, not saying they took it, but they were the only others that touched it.</text>< user_name>

<review>Every time Amazon uses this company I can't get my packages. I live in a secure building and it clearly says to ring the manager and they never do and leave with my things. Fedex, UPS, post office, they never have any problems and my packages are there when I get home. Ontrac, never. From now on I'm asking who is shipping and not ordering if they use this company.< /review><time>1494983902937< /time><user_id>110663227828246989300< /user_id>< Response>

< Review>
How are they still in business?! This company should be shut down. Every time something gets send though OnTrac it never gets to my place on time or at all. I order packages through Amazon Prime, so I was guaranteed 2-day delivery (the exact reason *why* I have a Prime account in the first place). Its been over 6 days now and I still don't have my package after calling OnTrac for 4 days! Its "out for delivery" and its been 6 days, insane! The drivers never show up but they claim they do... awful.< /Review>

Last week I was waiting for a package to be delivered to my OFFICE , a BUSINESS not a home . Well at 5:30 pm I get an update that it was delivered to the front door at 12:38. Really? There isn’t a front door for it to leave it . I was in office and saw no one come . I called customer service twice and they said they’d call me back ... no one called . I will be reporting them to BBB . Stolen packages are not a good thing .</review>

I have a front yard where my dogs run around during the day. Usually UPS will call over my gate, "UPS!" so I can run out and retrieve the package and sign if needed. USPS will do the same. When ONTRAC comes, they'll stand there for like 2 seconds outside my gate, and then just drop the package over the gate. This really irritates me because they don't even try to alert me that they are waiting. Second, they leave it on the ground for the dogs to chew. Third, I don't live in the safest neighborhood and they leave it in perfect reach for someone to just grab and walk away.
Today, however, was especially irritating and it's what lead me to write this review. Today I glanced out the window JUST in time to see what appeared to be the ONTRAC driver's girlfriend wearing a spaghetti strap tank top walk to my gate, toss my package 15 feet onto my porch, and get back into the van and starts playing with her smartphone. Are you kidding me?? Absolutely the worst, and couldn't be less professional.< /Review>

<review>Extremely Unprofessional! The second time within a two month period that the carrier failed to deliver time sensitive 1-day shipping product. Twice going so far as to claim that "I" the resident and client, did not live at the address and or was not home, both scenarios were blatant lies, as my wife and I waited home all day for these time sensitive packages. The good news is that Amazon claims that they will not be renewing their contract with Ontrac. Avoid Ontrac at all costs!< /review></record></dataset><record>

My husband and I have Amazon Prime, with that being said we absolutely dread whenever we see that ONTRAC is handling our package. Their favorite excuse is "unable to access gate/code required" which is completely unreasonable because  our phone number and gate access code are on the shipping label. This is laziness or incompetence at it's finest. I hope amazon drops ontrac as a partner.< /Text>

<Review>Sun Valley Area - Worst Job Ever. (Midnight Shift) Managers are crappie they just either drink (Alcohol) & run the forklift or just cheer you on to hurry up. Employees are pathetic, they act like they run the place & do less work then others that are temporary and do the simple jobs. I got paid 11 an hour for a midnight shift?!?! I ain't dumb to stay. Not even get a full shift like the (lazy ones) they would give me. People are careless about packages as well. As the girls look like they do more work then the guys! I didn't like the employees a bunch of kids but there was cool ones. I got put with the (boss) acting ones & I ain't going to deal with them haha they just are basic humans, nothing special.

Me and my wife ordered from Amazon awhile back. We got lucky and are package was only a day late but it still didn't show up till 10pm the next night that's crazy. Do they expect people to stay up all night waiting for your package. Now we are waiting for a 300 doller item that is supposed to be here by 8pm tonight on 11/23/15 so will c but i dought it will show up tonight. This company sucks. I think it's the drivers mostly that causes the problems. Will c tonight.<//Text>

They lost my package already twice. And delivered to my house very expensive coffee machine that belongs to somebody else. I had to use my gas and car to deliver to correct person and return his expensive item. I would love to put less than one star but there is no choice to do it.

I think it  is superrrrrrrr funny how they supposedly say NO GATE ACCESS on 9/10 orders they deliver to my house when all they have to do is ring the bell and I can buzz them in? WHAT more easier access do u need? AND I HAVE ACTUALLY WITNESSED THEM not even ATTEMPT to walk up to the door once they were outside, they drover right off while I was walking my dog and they didn't even walk up to the door. Bunch of LAZY people ...</Review>

I checked outside my door at 11:20am, and nothing was there.

I live on the top floor of an indoor complex; the likelihood of one of my seven neighbors, all of whom I have known for over a year, stealing the package within the 20 minutes between the supposed delivery and my checking is almost nonexistent.

After reporting the package as not delivered to OnTrac, the following day, the delivery driver came to my apartment and lied to my face. They will not take any kind of responsibility. A Google search for OnTrac yields a plethora of one star reviews with very similar stories. What more can I say?< /Review>< Rate>

I'm not sure why Ontrac would tell me that they attempted to deliver my packages while I was outside waiting for them for hours hoping I wouldn't miss my delivery... !!! I received a notification stating they were here when they never showed up!!! I paid for expedited shipping for nothing through Amazon!!!< /review>

<Text>Worst customer service and delivery, paid extra for next day delivery and driver went to wrong address, driver updated unable to deliver due to gated access. I don't live in a gated community.

<date>1423541486669< /date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>This is the absolute worst shipping carrier company ever. Even after complaining to Amazon customer service about their marked delivery which had not come, they still did not deliver. This company should go out of business as there are much better carrier services like USPS, and FedEx. I hope somebody from this atrocious company reads this as I am extremely pissed that my package has yet to come. This is unacceptable that I must contact Amazon just to receive my package which should have come a week ago. If you ever see this as your shipment carrier for your packages prepare to never receive jack.</review>< pictures>

I have had the misfortune of having 3 package delivered from Amazon by Ontrac.  The first package was promised to be delivered on Sunday.  I waited at home the whole day and no one showed up.  They did manage to claim that they attempted and weren't able to deliver.  I guess the driver didn't feel like working on a Sunday.  The second package was marked as delivered, but wasn't anywhere to be found.  2 days plater it showed up with the box very damaged, cut wide open, and near the back entrance of my building.  I suspect they just threw it over the fence.  As to why it was open, I can only assume that the driver was curious, so they looked inside and decided they didn't want it.  I'm lucky they didn't know what it was otherwise they would have kept it since it was very expensive.  I'm also lucky that it wasn't damaged.  The final package (and the final straw) was not delivered today.  I paid for fast shipping because I needed it today.  NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DELIVER MY PACKAGE.  None whatsoever.  The reason listed is amazingly absurd as well "Delivery attempted - business closed".  The shipment was sent to a residence; not a business.  This is absolutely absurd.  I am amazed that Amazon still uses this company.<//Text>

<Review>Terrible service and does not deliver on time. My first shipment that came from them from amazon, they threw my package (which had very expensive electronics) onto my garden. They didn't not care about the package at all. I had to get my first package RETURNED because of this. Also, when i asked for a 2 day shipping, it took them 3 days to complete it and again, they mistreated my package again. I am not ever buying from Amazon again!<//Review>< gmapID>

The worst company I have ever had to deal with. Customer service is okay but they never solve my problems. If you live in an apatment like I do, then you'll never get your package because they never even stop by to try and deliver it.
I would rather not curse, but I REALLY REALLY HATE ONTRAC.
Just go bankrupt already.<//review>

<Review>Prime customer as well here with same experiences: packages do make it to their local facilities for delivery within Prime scheduling but they sit there for days, often only a few miles from the recipient. That is very frustrating.

Or they claim to Amazon that they attempted a delivery and dumb Amazon passes on that lie to their valued customer. This is not acceptable.

Ask for credit from Amazon and if enough of us do that, they will stop using NotOnTracAtAllEver<//Review><UserId.>105690436158603929582<//UserId.><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Review>If I can only give this sorry excuse for a company a zero i definitely would! I ordered next day from amazon anticipating the trip i had the day after. 10pm came and I HAVE NOTHING besides their guarantee to make it by 9pm. I tried calling their customer service and was on hold for 35 mins with no answer. This is a logistics job, and you're main and only job is to deliver packages in time. Amazon will file a complaint against this carrier and i filed a complain against Better Business Bureau. Getting a package delivered by a donkey is more of a guarantee than ontrac!< /Review>< rate>

<Text>I called customer service two days ago and requested they hold a package as my office was going to be closed on the scheduled delivery date. The rep I spoke with said he would note my request. I checked the tracking again today, when my office is closed, and it is out for delivery. They are stupid. I called customer service again, and this time was told that they can't speak to me because the company the package was ordered from likes to handle these inquiries (now I know why, because everyone who works for On Trac collectively has 1/2 of a functioning brain cell). The company the package was ordered from got On Trac to hold the package, but now due to their idiocy, I have to go pick it up myself because they can't figure out how to schedule it for delivery again. Stupid.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Avoid this company at all cost! I had never even heard of them before my package had be shipped by them from Amazon. I order quite a few things from Amazon and this is the first time I haven't received my package. I'm also an Amazon Prime user and often get the 2 day shipping. The package was suppose to arrive on Friday but it is now Tuesday and I've had not word from the courier. I've also called OnTrac and have been unable to get through to anyone. I'm not one to complain or write complaints but I would just like to suggest that you maybe you cancel any orders that may be shipped by them because you're just going to waste your time and money and cause yourself unnecessary stress.<//text>

I needed  an  item delivered the same day. Your delivery guy couldn't deliver my package because he needed the code to get into the building. there's a call box next to the gate all you have to do is ring my apartment number. I needed it by Saturday the 27th. Now I have to wait till Monday.  No other delivery person had a problem. Or you could've called my cell phone number. I had to call Amazon so that I can get the  extra delivery charge taken off.  How disappointed I am with onyrac!<//Review>

< Review>
Amazon sent my order using OnTrac for one part of the order and FedEx for another. The FedEx package came right on time, but OnTrac never came. However, they still marked the package as being delivered. The driver even marked a delivery time, coincidentally within a few minutes of FedEx's actual delivery. I contacted OnTrac and they claimed the package was delivered and said they had no additional information, were completely unhelpful and took no credit for the problem. I contacted Amazon, who responded within four hours acknowledging the package was lost in transit, provided a new shipment and upgraded this and another order to next day delivery to make up for it. Unfortunately, they used OnTrac again. OnTrac not only failed to deliver a second time, but their driver claimed he was unable to access my house because of a gate code. But, there is no gate, and no code. I called OnTrac's tracking line, and they paged the driver while I was on the phone and promised to call back right away to set up a redelivery time. On the call back, however, the Customer Service people said the driver changed his story and said he didn't have enough information because I forgot to include an apartment number. I told them I don't have an apartment number either, and they already had the complete address. OnTrac also said they weren no longer going to try to redeliver the package because the driver had other places to be on his route. Avoid this courier at all costs.</Review>

Worst service ever! They marked an undamaged package damaged and held it in the warehouse. Then there is no way to get a hold of them, nor they updated the shipping status. The package contains medicines for my injury and it is important for me to get it on time.<//Text>

THE WORST COMPANY EVER!  The driver lied and said he "could not get into the building," but the apartment buzzer is directly linked to my cell phone and I never received a call from them.  Oh, and there was ANOTHER package to a different customer that somehow made it inside our building for delivery that very same day.  Strange how that works.  I ordered a gift for my anniversary and now it will not get here on time because of their terrible lying piece of garbage drivers.  I am entering the 50th minute on hold with them with little hope of a resolution.  How could Amazon use this terrible, awful, no good excuse for a delivery company.  Shame on you OnTrac!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Text>

OnTrac is the worst,  A few times an item was at their office in plenty of time to be delivered on a Saturday but didn't get delivered until Monday.
Then they falsify records by saying a package was delivered but wasn't then deliver it the next day.< /Review>

Terrible customer service! Terrible delivery service! I've written a review about these idiots before but they don't seem to care what people think since they continue to employ incompetent human beings. I placed 2 separate orders through Amazon, the first package never came because the driver "could not locate my address", seemed like a logical excuse until my second package arrived from OnTrac 2 days later. How is one driver able to locate my address and the other not?! The second driver must have some sort of super powers. OnTrac should reassign this amazing person to locate big-foot or the loch ness monster. Or better yet this driver should go work for a real company like UPS who NEVER has trouble finding my house or getting my packages to me on time.<//Text>

I wish I could give them 0 stars. They lost another package, this time a new computer being shipped to me from Apple. This is the 4th or 5th time they have lost a shipment and they seem to be completely useless at taking things down. I can see why Amazon doesn't use them much anymore.< /Review>

Thank you for give me a chance try Amazon Prime for free ( first month). Today i have a first experience with your service. My order supposed to be - One-day delivery  .
There's a call box next to the gate all you have to do is ring my apartment number. I also leave my phone number when i make order. So, when i was home and wait for my delivery...i got a messeg:
" The carrier was not able to access the front door to deliver your package. This sometimes occurs when carriers do not have an access code for a gated community or secure building. Please contact for next steps."
Any call to me , any stick on main entrance...
You realy think they ( "OnTrac" ) was here ? Because  i'm not.<//Review>

<Review>Terrible customer service! Terrible delivery service! I've written a review about these idiots before but they don't seem to care what people think since they continue to employ incompetent human beings. I placed 2 separate orders through Amazon, the first package never came because the driver "could not locate my address", seemed like a logical excuse until my second package arrived from OnTrac 2 days later. How is one driver able to locate my address and the other not?! The second driver must have some sort of super powers. OnTrac should reassign this amazing person to locate big-foot or the loch ness monster. Or better yet this driver should go work for a real company like UPS who NEVER has trouble finding my house or getting my packages to me on time.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Driver claimed the address was wrong which is impossible since I had two other packages ordered on same day from amazon arrive however "OnTranquilizers" never delivered.  I have had deliveries from them before they always tear down my street in their cheech and chong vans looking like they just got out of prison. I cant believe amazon which has such great service uses this co. BTW im typing this while I have been on hold for the past 20min with "OnTerrible"<//text><GmapID>0x80c2941467eef8ef:0xb820800153c74386</GmapID><Rate>1<//Rate>< user_id>

<Review>Ontrac supposedly delivered my package to my door while I was at work but I could not locate it when I got home. I called them the next day to inquire about my missing package and they said "sometimes packages are marked as delivered but take one more business day to arrive". So I waited until Monday and still no package. Called them back on Tuesday morning only for them to tell me "we are waiting to hear back from the driver to see when he can make it out to your house to HELP you locate the package". Later that day I was assured that the original driver would be at my house by 5pm on Wednesday to "help me  locate" the package. I called Ontrac at 6pm on Wednesday because I had not seen a driver yet, only to be told that "the driver showed up unannounced and TRIED HIS HARDEST, but was unsuccessful in locating it". If the driver shows up unannounced how is he supposed to "help" me locate the package? How do I know he even came back to the correct address, or if he even really came back at all?

To sum this up Ontrac provides TERRIBLE customer service and even worse delivery service.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< userid>

<Text>Made an order on the 9th of September with 2 day shipping, scheduled to arrive on the 11th. it is now the 15th and my package was delivered to Seattle, Washington......i live in Los Angeles, California. I had to cancel my order and just drove to nearest store which carries the original product i ordered, which is an hour away. Now anytime a package is sent through ontrac i call amazon support and request a change to either Fedex or UPS for delivery.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>THE WORST EXPERIENCE!!!
I'm not exactly sure WHAT is going on with OnTrac but 3 out of 4 different deliveries had to be rescheduled due to a "problem" with the driver or my address that the driver couldn't find! They had my phone number, but didn't call. Never had any issues with UPS, FedEx, USPS or DHL. Even after giving their supervisor directions and getting their assurances that the long-awaited package from Nordstrom will arrive on time for my girlfriend birthday, it never arrived after waiting ALL day for 4 days for my "out on delivery" package.
I contacted Nordstrom Customer Service supervisor and informed them about my experience. They said that they will never use OnTrac again.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

<Text>Ontrac drivers are pretty much worthless. Ordered item through Amazon for delivery before Xmas. Order was split into 2 separate shipments, one fulfilled by Fedex, and another ontrac. The part fulfilled by Fedex arrived promptly around 10am on 12/23. However, the delivery by ontrac NEVER ARRIVED.  Even though it was marked as" delivered " on 1pm.

Clueless customer service, and shady drivers. Don't tell me its " busy " season. It's your job to make these deliveries, why can one carrier do the job and you cannot?

By the look of other reviews, Ontrac loves to " deliver " packages and never actually deliver them. Good things Amazon covers the incident and shipped replacement. However, Ontrac was used once again.

I honesty hope they arrive this time. If it was up to me, I would NEVER USE their services again.

Stay away from, and request Amazon to use a different carrier whenever possible.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Date>1419716227716<//Date><name>Mike Chang</name>< Rate>

Worst delivery service. they just throw our packages on our front lawn or in the bushes and when you call customer service for help, they treat you horribly. I run a marketing/promotion company and I plan to release a viral press release and do SEO work so everyone will know how they are. If you have a horror story of Ontrac treating you horrible or throwing your packages, please contact me ASAP. thanks< /text>

I ordered something through Amazon Prime and the item was shipped through OnTrac. They left me a message through Amazon that they couldn't get into my building, but I've ordered countless other things from Amazon and no other delivery service has ever had a problem getting to my front door.<//Review>

Invariably I have a problem with OnTrac. I have big signs at my front door, "Leave ALL packages below the window to the left". They leave it in the bushes, in front of the garage, behind a planter....and today a package from Amazon is due and OnTrac says "incorrect address. Undeliverable". My God I've been here for 21 years, Amazon has the right address, and OnTrac is clueless....Really would not like them delivering my things.< /text>

This shipping company is terrible. Two days in a row now, the delivery guy has been too lazy to deliver my package, and has just marked it as failed delivery.

Except just one problem. I was home all day!!  The truck never even came by the house.< /text>

STAY AWAY!!! THE WORST SHIPPING COMPANY EVER! They have lost 3 shipments in 2 weeks. They have one of them marked delivered and signed for, by someone who does not live here and we have never heard of. They refuse to help us saying the driver has come back to the location- they never did. They stole our box and now I am out $100s because they claim it is delivered. On another shipment that is lost they tell me everyday someone will be out to deliver it, and they never do, claiming non-deliverable. USELESS service. FRAUD. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE</Review>

<review>This Company has the worst delivery I have seen and had the displeasure of having to use. 2 different deliveries have been returned to the seller because they state I was not at home but when I call them it's because they can't access gated communities  like every other shipper and they don't even call to let you know. They just return it and problem solve. If I could give this company 0 stars I would.< /review>< name>

Whenever ontrac is used for my amazon shipments, they always mark my items as DELIVERED when they have been lost, delayed, or just canceled. Terrible customer service, never had a decent or even mediocre experience</Review>

<Text>Shady. Unable to reach via the phone. > 1 hour hold time?! Someone who runs this company must be a child of some VP at Amazon, otherwise I can't explain why the latter is using these clowns. Will call Amazon every time I use the Prime service for delivery to make sure these idiots are not the delivery carriers.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Fedex delivered a package to them addressed to my p.o. box. Says its ready for pickup when I check the status I went down and got told in no way did they receive any fedex shipments today let alone around 6 am. FedEx is saying it absolutely was delivered to the post office.< /Text>< Name>

The post office itself is fine , the people are courteous and very friendly. Its the mail women that i have a problem with. She drives extremely fast, she wouldn't have time to slow down if a child or animal walked out in the road. She refuses to stop when your at your mail box to ask her a question and she will not close our mail boxes, ive found my mail on the ground more than a dozen times. They should have someone investigate her because something bad can happen and she does'nt seem to care one bit. Thank you very much.</review>

Had to send in for a passport.  Had to buy a money order.  Long story short, money order and application never arrived, I requested an image of the cashed money order and the employee that was assisting at this post office had my money order shipped to wrong address and the funds were stolen...  This post office is shifty, be very careful going here.< /text>

If you love losing mail they are perfect

We had a P.O box with them and when it lapsed and we re-paid for it they never re-opened the box. We went there for a year saying it was weird we had no mail and they ignored us. We lost packages from ebay worth over $100 because of them and they wouldn't even refund the P.O box fee. Would give negative stars if I could.</Review>

Had a delivery and a miss delivery on the same day. Talk to them and they said it depends on the carrier. How Stupid and lazy.  They are getting worse everyday. At first they always dropped off the boxes we ordered and now we're lucky to get one while we're home. They also said that they honk their horn. YA RIGHT I'm standing outside when they come to drop off the mail. Just plain lazy<//review>

<Name>Vincent Morano< /Name><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>I dealt with a younger man who had to be paged multiple times to the counter. I was then told I could not mail my packages unless they already had the address marked and was promptly told "... And I don't have a marker." before I had even asked. Obviously I don't carry one on me. I asked for a label and was told "the only labels available are for priority and if I use them it has to be mailed priority." I don't think shipping a few packages is much to ask. I understand there are procedures for shipping, but considering most their job is customer service, it might be smart to find someone friendly.

The ONLY reason I will be going back is because we don't have other options in clearlake. Horrible service.< /Review>< UserId.>

Many of my packages have came up missing and they tell me it was delivered. Some staff are rude, but there are a couple who are nice and seem like they really care about the service they provide. Can't wait to move though because I've never had problems receiving my packages anywhere else I've lived.</Text>

I had called to triple check on their hours and availability for renewing Passports, as my wife and I needed to renew ours. I had already printed off the renewal forms and we'd filled them out, just needed the photo's and some assistance making sure we mailed everything in correctly. They confirmed their hours and their walk-in no appointment necessary status for doing them. We went in about 11:30 am on a Thursday and were relieved to see they were nearly empty, no customers. It's a large P.O. with plenty of space to park. When we got there we saw they had a sign up on the service desk "No Passports Today", so we went to the window to ask about their status. The clerk told us they had one person that could do them, they were on lunch break in the back and they didn't know if they would be doing them after lunch or not. So we asked if there was a way to find that out, as we'd be happy to run another errand then come back in an hour. Before he went back to ask about that he rummaged through the trash and tore off a little strip of paper and wrote their phone number on it and gave it to me. While I wondered how the PO didn't have a tablet or some yellow stickies to give out information to customers on, he went back and asked about this and after about 3 minutes came back. He said no, he didn't know for sure but we might want to try the Lakeport PO. They take appointments, so we'd have to call them and see or go on their website. I asked if he had the number and address and he rummaged around in the trash for some paper and tore off a tiny piece of paper again and wrote that information on it for me and gave it to me.
- My wife and I left and went to the car and tried the online site, but were unable to get their appointment scheduler to open so we called....my wife told them what we wanted to do and they told us, sure - renewals and taking photos are quick, they'd be happy to do it for us, all we needed to do was come in, they'd take the photo and then help us send the forms in the correct mailer, pay the fees and we'd be done. Come on in
- We did and they were really helpful. We waited off to the side and the person who came to help us checked to make sure we had the right forms ready, and we did and she took us back to take the photos. She printed them and about 5 minutes later we were done and thanking them for being so helpful.
- I was kind of amazed at how differently they were at the two offices. My other experiences at PO's has been pretty good. When we're in Middletown (Bob and his crew rock!), Rohnert Park (Always!!), Santa Rosa, Alameda - just about everywhere they're always helpful and reasonably courteous even when really busy. And they always have basic office supplies like paper to write a customer notes on, pens to write with, etc. I felt sorry for Clearlake, like I should drop off some packs of yellow stickies or something and let them know I'm a pretty good photographer myself so if they give me the correct spec's and processing information I'd be happy to free lance - or even volunteer. They do need some help to be sure and I have to give it one star if only because the USPS should stand by what they publish on their website and what they give out over the phone. Hopefully they will get the help they need to do so.
- So big prop's to Lakeport for seeing us and understanding that a renewal is much less demanding than a new one to process (a process I don't know much about as a customer) and doing us inbetween whatever other appointments they had, and doing so as if it was the easiest thing for them to do.</Text>

Horrible horrible service unless you deal with Tom or the one other skinny older lady that works the counter everyone else is terrible they make you wait forever for them to put a yellow card in your box before you can pick up your package even if you've tracked the package and it states your package is ready for delivery... They don't work with you if you have a shipping problem.... They just ship your package back to sender with no notice... There customer service is terrible especially the postmaster! He's a jerk! And now the counter is closed weekends! This sucks!</review>

They lock their doors so we can't get in to our post office box when we need to they wouldn't like it if somebody did that to them but they do it to us and there's no sign on the door that says they're going to be closed for the 1st of January they could just unlock the doors we could check our mail</review>

<Review>My scheduled pick ups are routinely missed.  The carrier will drop the mail in the mail box but not pick up packages at my door.  I have taken to leaving a written request in my mailbox , with the red pick up flag up, but the carrier still often just ignores it.  THIS IS WHY I USE FEDEX NOW.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Horrible experience.  Salesman Larry won my business by promising May 1st install date.  May 1st came and went.  No-show.  I called them (they did not call me) to push for another install date.  They promised May 3rd., 8am-4pm window.  No-show, and no communication.....I called them......the process repeated., and repeated, and repeated.....they finally showed up on install date 6.  Yep, there were no-shows 5 times.  Jasmine, installation coordinator, lied to me multiple times.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1621024711171, 'text': "Benjamin, we're sorry that this has happened.

Worst experience of my life. It took multiple crews multiple days to do our home and they damaged so much stuff that we had to be reimbursed from empire by getting 3 quotes from contractors and then getting our reimbursement back from empire took forever for damage they caused.
This company is extremely unorganized no one knew what was going on. Their model is  quantity over quality. Get the guys in and out as fast as they can and on to the next job. They only pay their guys by the job, so in a house that’s going to require more time and skill it won’t happen since the workers need to be in and out.
Also they couldn’t even lay carpet correctly in our box shaped bedrooms there was a huge seem running right down the middle I noticed right away. Then in our closet where I guess they think you won’t go, exposed tax strips.
1st crew couldn’t finish our job since showing up at 4pm but they were kind enough to pull all the carpet off the stairs and lay down tax strips and say ok we have to go now and we are not sure we will be back. So we had them cover the exposed tax strips with cut off carpet as we also have pets and they won’t know to avoid those and good thing because it was a few days till another crew came back. That crew 2nd crew spent all day trying to wrap our stairs and got one done that was done poorly. They kept telling me there was no way anyone else in our 62 unit complex had these stairs. Nope they all do it’s how they were built. 2nd crew left still we had exposed tax strips on our stairs that we are using scrap pieces to cover. Finally the third guy Caesar only guy who knows what he is doing was able to wrap the stairs and oh said he had done another unit just like ours in our complex. He also had to fix our other normal set of stairs as those were not done correctly by 2nd crew. On one bottom piece they  literally just stuck the carpet piece up to it so it was free floating. Then the rest needed to be done as it was frayed looking they couldn’t get the bull nose of the stair correct. So finally no more exposed tax strips but to bad one cat stepped on one, thankfully not bad.
Then finally the 4th guy to fix the closets and cover the tax strips.
2nd crew removed our stair handrail and put gashes in our drywall that had to be re-mudded and painted. They also broke of piece of wood from the handrail and then didn’t put it back on. 3rd guy put it back on cause he said you can’t wrap the stairs with it off and was baffled by why the other guys took it off. Our bedroom door was broken at the bottom and we had so many scratches everywhere from everything needing to be redone multiple times.
I will never use empire again even though their sales team has called me twice and I keep telling them to remove me from their call list I will never buy anything from you again.<//Text>

<Review>ust a quick note of appreciation for the Empire Today team. Don our sales advisor showed up exactly on time and gave us an education on the types of laminate floorings.  We had been shopping at the big box home improvement stores, and they offered no suggestions or advice and seemed like they just hoped we would leave them alone, Don presented our best options within our budget and we signed the contract with confidence we were getting the best product at an awesome price.
From the minute I met the installation team of  Josh and Jota, I felt honesty, superior knowledge, and confidence they would do an excellent job. They arrived both days precisely on time, explained what they would be doing, and worked quickly and professionally. They had great attitudes and were friendly and considerate. The installation was perfect, completed on time and not a trace of debris or waste was left behind.  Working in real estate I will be recommending  Empire to my clients and office.  Thanks for exceeding my expectations!  A+ A+ A+</Review></record></dataset><record>

Beware, my sister got her carpet removed to put floor tiles on the stairs, although they were nice people they left holes on our carpet way leading upstairs and my room now has a carpet ripping off the floor. On top of that they never came back to fix the rest of the flooring, definitely do not recommend this place whatsoever.<//review>

We are so disappointed. I've called customer service several times without a return call. We paid a lot of money for these floors and its just cheap work that was half done. Gaps everywhere and glue sticking out from the thresholds. I wish we kept our original floors now. $22,000 for this work is unacceptable. Also didn't help that the person installing the floors rummaged thru my laundry room to use my broom on the dusty glued old flooring, while he replaced the broom with a cheaper one, it was unprofessional to use without asking. If you need new floors search around and find someone that can do a better quality job. DO NOT use Empire Flooring.</Text>

<text>Over priced, I would say borderline scam.
2000 sqft of laminate quoted at 21k. This is their half price sale??? Which means normal price is 42k. Seems very wrong! Sales person said good luck and would not discuss other pricing options.</text>< rate>

Decent carpet for the price but read the fine print...

They will completely screw up your base trim and won't do anything about it.

What good is free installation if you have to hire a painter to come in after to repaint ALL your base trim?

Wish I had gone elsewhere for carpet and install.< /review>

Terrible first experience with Empire.
Scheduled a carpet install for Dec 29th, but days later I received an email stating it was for the 30th. I called and they said they made a mistake and would knock off $200 for the inconvenience. Great. I take the 30th off work to prep and be there for the installers and never received a call for a eta. I called them and they said I was scheduled for the 9th of Jan not the 30th, then all of a sudden it’s the 11th of Jan. Whaaaaaat!?!?! This was not the agreement and I may have missed out on Home Depot’s free installation offer because I decided to go with this incompetent business. Not good, Empire. Not good.</Text>

I have had major issues trying to get them to correct the situation and this has been going on for 8 months now! We purchased just before COVID-19 wood flooring for the 2nd floor of our Home and for the stairs and spent multiple Thousands of dollars!  The installer was good but we had some issues that I sent photos of and after 6 months of calling they came to look at and agreed there were mistakes made. They sent a supervisor to replace 5 stairs and he made them worse but left anyways and now they have been avoiding me since and that was 3 months ago!

I have one Attorney who said I should sue for the entire purchase price because they continue to charge me interest even when there has been a problem since March!!< /Text>

Was recommended by a family member and had a great experience.  From the Sales person to the installers, It was an easy process and we are very happy with the results.  They were respectful and professional and I though the price was fair.<//Text>

I was linked with Empire Today through Home Advisor. I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they were prompt about contacting me and scheding an appointment. It all went downhill from there. I clearly communicated what flooring I needed (tile brand, color and grout) as well as how I wanted it installed (herringbone) to  the person scheduling the appointment. However, the sales representative was completely unprepared. He did not know if you could even install herringbone and had to call someone. He hadn't even determined the tile/grout was available or the price of it. To top it off he left saying I would have a quote in 2-3 days. 4 days later someone else called me from  Empire asking if I received my quote. By this time the 3 other companies that I had engaged had already given their quotes. They all showed up to the project having done their homework and just needed to measure the scope of work for final bid. Empire's lack of professionalism and timeliness cost them the chance to complete for this project as well as my next 2 projects I have lined up.< /review>

Over $18,000 spent....the 'wood' floors are absolute garbage ....the quality is terrible...do not waste your money on this fake wood that they market as engineered wood ...it's a lowest quality engineered wood you can imagine... anyone and everyone that walks on it are stunned when I tell them it is engineered hardwood...they all felt it was laminate or vinyl wood look tile... And on top of it it scratches easily do not waste your money.<//Review>

EMPIRE TODAY! LEAVES HANDICAPPED CUSTOMER TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR! Today, an Empire installer arrived at Andrew's Kent, WA home to install carpet. Andrew is severely handicapped, and his brother and financial custodian had arranged with the company to make phone payment with the installers while they were on site and working. The problem arose when the installers arrived early, demanding payment before they would begin work, and Andrew couldn't immediately contact his brother to confirm payment. Rather than recognize the unique situation, the installers would not lift a finger to begin work, but left Andrew sitting on the porch, while they left to other jobs. Andrew's brother then spent the rest of the day--on telephone hold--with Empire's impersonal and powerless call centers. Have you ever spent a day on maddening hold with customer service, only to realize that they are powerless to do anything on your behalf? They just give you continuous cliches about how sorry they are for your inconvenience? That was our day with Empire. It was clear throughout the day that Empire's business model is not one tailored to customer service. The lesson for consumers is simple. First, no credible carpet company would demand payment in advance, before inspection of work is completed. Second, no reputable carpet company would employ installers that cannot recognize a unique situation and work within that situation in the customers' interest. Finally, Empire is a company that employs an impersonal call center "barrier," with telephone agents that are powerless to take action and are disconnected with other company departments. When you pay one department by phone, you can be sure that your payment will take hours, or days, to be communicated to other departments. All these are valuable lessons to be learned about Empire. But the most important is that EMPIRE TODAY! LEAVES HANDICAPPED CUSTOMER TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR!<//Review>

Everybody I dealt with at Empire Today, from my initial call, sales representative, installer, billing, and customer service office have been professional, efficient, and courteous.  The next time I need carpet work done, I will call them.  I highly recommend Empire Today.</Text>

The final product was outstanding quality, both porcelain tile that looks like hardwood and plush carpet that both turned out fantastic!  There were a couple of small communication bumps initially with scheduling delayed by a day, but the people were always very nice. The tile installers, especially Manny, were particularly kind and did an outstanding job. Our sales rep Lynda was very knowledgeable and patient with our questions, and Bret in local customer service was very professional.< /Review>

Working with this company was very refreshing. The sales rep measured the room, worked up the estimate, we discussed budget, and came to an agreement on price and scheduled the install all within a hour or so. The installer arrived on time. He was obviously experienced. The job was done in 4 hours. We will definitely contact Empire when we are ready to replace flooring in the rest of the house.</text>

<Review>The experience couldn't have been much worse if they had tried and we cancelled the rest of the order.  BEWARE of Empire.  We had laminate installed in the family room, kitchen and laundry room thinking we were getting water proof flooring.  The installers told us it was only water repellent meaning any spills had to be removed within an hour.  Who would want that in a kitchen or laundry room?!  Then the installers told us we needed a moisture sealant on the foundation at the cost of an additional $700.  Nice surprise!  We live in Escondido and only had 3" of rain the last year.  It seems to me ethics are lacking at this company.  We decided we were done with Empire and cancelled the order.  Then they offered to reduce the price of the carpet for the rest of the house by $1200.  We told them we don't do business with this type of company.  WATCH OUT FOR EMPIRE.  The salesman (Sam) will tell you anything to get you to sign a contract.</Review><user_name>Judy Bridgman< /user_name><Date>1536954167239</Date>< Gmap_id>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! The sales guy we had was completely HORRIBLE! Very cringy. He didn't bring us but only three samples of carpet AND laminate. Was very rude and pushy. He asked way too many personal questions, such as asking us how much our car was, how much we put down as a down payment, how much our house was, etc. way too personal. He made inappropriate jokes. He was all around horrible. He promised us we would get carpet two days later considering they were all booked up. That was a problem because we had paid movers to come the day he wanted to install, so we had to cancel movers and reschedule and pay a couple hundred for that. We were PROMISED installation on Thursday. Well guess what, Thursday morning comes and I get an email saying carpet is not going to be installed. Customer service is a joke. No help. Management didn't want to do anything. Now I have to pay the movers a SECOND TIME TO RESCHEDULE because they don't have enough materials. Horrible service all around. Only settled for this company because we needed fast installation. So much for next day!! Even second day. Don't use.</review>

Oh, My! Run don't walk from this company! I don't get it, they spend a fortune advertising to us on T.V. Then when they come out, you basically find out you have wasted your time. I am on hold with them right now as I write this. We called, we set an appointment, a lady came out and promised us everything we asked for. She did not have enough time to finish our quote. She promised she would email it that evening. The email did not come in the evening nor the morning. I called Empire the next morning and asked what's up? They called the sales lady and said I would be getting a call. That call never came!! So I'm on hold with them right now to see where the quote is.

There are so many carpet places, I would not even call these guys all they do is suck your time.</review>

Very satisfied with my experience from Empire. From the sale to completion everything went smoothly. The installers were 3 men and they had my bedroom, bathroom and closet finished in 3.5 hours. The men cleaned as they went, and although it was a rainy day, clean up went easily. This was my second experience with Empire and could not be happier.<//Review>

Empire flooring installed flooring on my staircase, however a error was detected, I notified the Co. they immediately sent someone out to view it. In a very short time the staircase was completely corrected together with a couple of other errors and thanks to Andy everything was done to perfection.  I would highly recommend Empire and especially Andy. I am very pleased with the end result.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Stay away from this company! Far away!
I had purchase flooring from them in January of 2019. I had a horrible interaction with them that time and still another one with this time! The salesman skipped corners of the appraisal so when the workers came to the job they were unprepared and did not have the right tools and pieces to install my floor (because there was a step in my house that had not been placed on the appraisal so they did not have the step stair-nose). Needless to say the install started taking place and and what was supposed to take 2 days took 5 days. I called to complain because I had lost a significant amount of money from my job being gone an unexpected 5 days instead of 2 (I was on the phone with customer service several times throughout this job and no one could ever seem to help me). I was hung up on by one teller because I told her I would wait on hold for the manager to get on the phone and she said she needed her line freed up to take other calls. Finally the manager called me back and did nothing for me. I emailed a very long message to their corporate office and they subsidized my cost of installation by $600 due to the money lost in my days of not working unexpectedly. Didn't account for the significant emotional stress I endured through this! However, why could no one at the managerial or general manager level help me at the SD location?? No idea!
Later, July of 2019 I had a house flood which led to some removal of my brand new flooring and needing to be replaced. I did not want to go through Empire, but was forced to because they would not sell me the floor out right and apparently monopolize the flooring industry to some degree, so only they sell the type of floor that they put in my home. I know this because my restoration company and homeowners insurance attempted to find it for me before I was forced to go through them again. So, an assessment had to be done through Empire which they charged me $170 for (but when you call to get a home estimate, it's free), but nonetheless I was at a loss because I had to go through them apparently. $170 later they said they could install for me the same floor because it was not old, and I got it done 9/18/2019. It looked the same one piece to another piece - and it was to some degree; however, when laid down and installed was noticeably different in sheen and texture/feel of it. I told their GM once again that it's not the same and they need to install the same flooring as they promised me. He argued it was the same. In fact, I spoke to him many times and the first reason for it not being the same was because of the chemicals I wipe my floors with. Water? Water can change texture to that degree? No. The boss installer revisited my house - funny, because the installer who came back out to look at it took pictures and took a slab from both old and new floor to show the significant difference because he stated it was significantly different. I told the GM (Jay Slate) I would pay for the job when it was done, as promised (but it was not done, it was not the same floor). I told the GM they needed to come back and install the same floor or I need to look into replacing my whole floor if this was not possible (which would mean another insurance claim). He said he was going to send my account to collections for the $775 I needed to pay them for the incorrect floor they installed. I have contacted the BBB.

I noticed on the other reviews that reach out to every reviewer on here to tell them to contact them to get a better solution. Empire.... your customer service representatives, management, and even GM is awful! There is nothing you can do to fix a scam company like yourself except start being honest and fair! When your GM is awful, you know your company is meant for scams!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
BUYER BEWARE!!!! I ordered carpet from Empire. The sales woman Sharon was unorganized and condescending. Made several references to how "small" the job was to recarpet my master bedroom. Was very pushy about me giving her my credit card information and seemed concerned about my ability to pay.

On Wednesday, the carpet showed up with a huge tear in the middle of it, so had to reschedule (after I already took a day off work).  Came three days later, on Saturday, they came back with the SAME roll with the tear in it! Unbelievable!! Said that they never had an extra roll to begin with.

My suggestion is go to Tri City Carpet. I went there at 10 am this morning, the same Saturday Empire came, and they are installing it now at 1:30 pm. Amazing customer service. And less expensive than Empire!

Stay away from Empire,  i would give them a negative 5 if possible!<//Review>

The smell from it was so bad that I pulled it up myself and rolled it. I made an appointment for a sales person to come out. Robert came to discuss my needs. I asked him if the carpet layers will clean and scrub the floor befor laying the new carpet. He assured me they will. We placed the order and also received a nice discount. The layers came and just sweped the floor with a broom. Asked them about cleaning it and they said that they dont do that. If I would have been told the truth, I would have cleaned it my self. Anything for a sale. I notified the company and someone would call me back. They did while I was at work and couldn't answer my phone. The told me to give them a call. I know not to trust car sales men. This has been added to the list. I have 2 more rooms to do. I'll revisit Coles.<//Review><Rating>2<//Rating>< resp>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>The Luxury Vinyl Installers, Horrible! - The Carpet Guys, Excellent

This review was asked for by Empire via an email, months after this incident. I did not write this review until Empire asked me to via an email.

I contracted and paid for both carpeting and the Luxury Vinyl Tiles or Planking (LVT or LVP) in 2 bathrooms.

It all was supposed to be done in one day, carpeting and flooring. However when they came on the first trip, they did not have the flooring, just the carpeting. A second appointment was made for the flooring. (The bad part of this was we were having it all installed the day before out-of-town guests arrived to stay at our house.)

The two guys who came out the second time for the flooring, were idiots. Only one spoke very limited English, the other spoke no English. They wouldn't get out of the truck because I had dogs, a pug a Belgian and an old, old Boxer. They wanted the dogs in the house, but the issue is, guess what? The flooring is going to go in the house, not outside!

They wanted me to get rid of the dogs while they were here. What was I supposed to do? Board them? So the main guy, who spoke zero English, refused to do the job. The limited English speaking passenger finally got out of the van and showed the driver the dogs were fine. Nope, the driver wanted them gone from the property. Finally after about 20 minutes of this nonsense, I walked back inside and they sat in the driveway for about 30 minutes. When they went to leave, there was a huge transmission oil spot which I made them clean up, but it still left a mark.

You'd think Empire would be calling me right away. Nope, they didn't until about 3 weeks later. I had moved on by then.

Carpet guys were as nice as could be and did an excellent job.

Would be 5 stars for the carpet guys and just zero stars for the vinyl installers.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1505761778540, 'text': 'Dear Customer,\nWe regret to hear this, and would like to further discuss your experience.

Go to home Depot save yourself a lot of time and frustration
Empire carpet is a  Complete  ripp off
Con job,  waste of time
go to home Depot there price is $5000 out the door
At empire carpet ,  $12,000 minus 50 percent off  $6000  total
and lower ounce face weight carpet

Not a sale at all , or a good deal
deceptive advertising To say the least

Also will not honor installers work
If things go bad and they will !

U have been warned
Empire today no way stay away !<//Text>

Company lacks any kind of customer service. After overcharging you and installation, you'll never reach them for any disagreement. Do not buy in this company, run away!!!</Review>

<review>Really good food i had the Mexican ham and eggs with toast. Cost i think was around 7 or 8 dollars. Had the chili the other day and it smelled good, but it lacked something the taste was different from the smell . Had the pastrami just yesterday and it was really good the pastrami was very tender and easy to chew not full of fat. I hear the international omelette is a hit, i have yet to try it.<//review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

The burger was delicious and the fries were good....HOWEVER, my girl got those items while I got the "homemade" clam chowder. Never EVER have i had something that was this nasty. It was completely FLAVORLESS! No salt, the meat was VERY fatty and it tasted like water. Someone needs to be retrained on what homemade means because that ain't it, smh. Definitely a pass</Text>

<Text>Great place for burgers and more. The drive thru was quick, the service friendly, and the food delicious. Everything a great burger place should be.
And the burger special for only $5.99 for a huge burger, fries and a drink is awesome!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I never leave reviews, but the light and fluffy supple french toast drizzled with their syrup that  soaked in just right, paired with their savory and tender but not overpowering sausage was too good not to tell. The service was fast and friendly and I’ve never been more satisfied with a breakfast meal. Thank you :)< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Lol I love authentic Mexican Food but, again lol I'm kinda into Yorgo's crunchy pre formed taco shells and crispy lettuce, sweet ripe tomatoes & unseasoned meat ...it works I enjoy them. Top them off with Heinz Taco sauce (ask for it). Yummy Yummy<//Text>

Worst "local" burger place EVER! The buns are stale, maybe even has mold on them... white dots on the top of bun, crumbed in my hands.
Worst customer service, she also didn't listen when I stated no sauces on the burger, so my 2yr. son reffused to eat it. And the sodas are pure carbonation!!!! ! #ripoff<//text>

This place has just about everything that could meet the demands of the most hungry and those wanting a variety. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner are all covered in both quality and quantity. Having ate there over 100 times, I have never been disappointed.</text>

<Review>Great place to have a burger and some chili fries. Put ketchup on the burgers and chili fries. They have been open since I was like 5 years old and that is in the 1980's era. Bring back the arcade machines please ,which were there when I was young. Oh, my childhood flashbacks..... still a bomb place to eat in the Gardena area.<//Review><UserId.>113323197595638216787<//UserId.></record>

<Review>Never disappoints! Classic charbroiled burgers, chili fries and onion rings! Breakfast is always great too, especially if you want to take the kids out but not spend a lot. Burger, fries and a fountain drink for only $3.99, nowhere else in the South Bay. Not to mention the owners and staff are always polite. Thank you Yorgos staff :D< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Pretty average southern California burger joint. They do offer a variety of things to eat beyond just burgers, to include breakfast and full dinner options. Also, the prices are very reasonable. You can get a burger, fries and a drink for $3.99. Overall, solid but not spectacular.<//review>< pictures>

I do not recommend ordering the number 1 and the number 12 and really nothing was good the pancakes seemed plastic the meat had no flavor to be shorter it is possible to say that the only good thing was the soda and not the coffee that seemed pure hot water the service of the boy who took the order not very nice they have a lot to improve is definitely the first and last time I eat in this place</review>

<review>Followed my nose - just driving by and couldn’t believe how good it smelled! Pulled over and tried their Colossal Burger, chili-cheese fries and drink - AMAZING!!

The pastrami was spot-on! Juicy and flavorful! The chili-fries had just the right taste - not sweet or spicy. Just the right flavor. Wow!!< /review><Date>1513637990951<//Date>< user_name>

I stopped by for a $4 combo @ local biz. Got cheddar cheese added. Now we go there before going to a chain. And the Zuchinni! Exactly how I love it! Be back asap to try other items.< /review>

Great charburger joint food. Killer omelets, burgers and burritos. Their breakfast tacos are an almost genius-like creation. AND, they have bagels. Friendly people, especially if it's on Sunday for breakfast.< /review>

<Review>A cool little mom and pop shop. Great prices, good food and super clean. My favorite are the breakfast tacos. Lupe is very nice and she always has a big smile. If your in the neighborhood stop by and try the breakfast tacos.

<review>I was just driving by this burger joint.  Then my friend said they had good burgers.  What's a GOOD burger? I thought... So instead of asking him. I drove in.
They had a full menu over the counter, i could see cars pull by their drive-thru, they didn't seem to be waiting to long... Star!  I had to ask the lady for the house specialty, she looked confused so i just went with a burger combo.
We ordered two of the same, when she rang us up the total was around $8bucks and change, cool.  As I was about to reach for my wallet to pay for my order.  She walked away...  It was the price for both combo's!... Boom! Star!  It didnt take long when she called our number. Two average sized burgers and pair of steaming hot fries, we already had our drinks.
Ok.. the fries were piping hot! Fresh out the fryer.  Burgers has noticeably fresh veggies, and a freshly cook patty I took a bite... Hmmmm.  I said "this is a good! Burger"...Star!  All in all there's nothing bad about this place, also nothing super.  That's it.

My friend wouldnt stop raving about the fountain drinks, he swore their syrup mix for the soda was unlike no other place in L.A....  IDK
So just in case he hits this post some day...Star!
...just cause you wouldn't stop talking about it Doug Stewart.< /review><gmapID>0x80c2b565c1cce723:0x732a465599567015< /gmapID>< user_name>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>Yorgos, I say this because I love you.. The prices are too high. All of them.

If you lowered all of your prices (except drinks) by $1.00 and put a sign by the street saying "All prices lowered!", you will get so many more customers that you'll be making more money immediately, and those customers will be happy too.

I love your food, but the prices are scaring me away, you're across the street from Wendy's and they make some pretty high quality fast food for even less money than you do. You must compete with their prices.

Maybe add a value menu too. (I never see one at the drive thru). I hope you give this advice a try, and I'm sure that I, and many others, will be happy eating at Yorgos again.<//Text><UserId.>103388739172602155197<//UserId.>< gmapID>

Food was ok. Fries need some seasoning. Burger was ok. Nothing really stood out. Just passed by to get the 4 dollar special they posted outside.</Review>

Quality of food is average and the place lacks a pleasant atmosphere. Number one problem is the prices of the food. Prices are very high!!
I understand that this is a growing epidemic amoungst the food industry, however with that said , this place is on the higher end with prices. Next time I am hungry and near this area, this will be the last place that will come to mind. Easily forgettable.< /Text>

Had the grilled chicken sandwich combo. The fries had no seasoning and the sandwich was nothing special. Overall, this is your run of the mill burger joint.<//Text>

This place, it's awful. How the heck are these reviews so good? I had the chili burger, regretted it as soon as I saw it served. It tasted like low quality meat topped with canned chili.<//Text>

But if you like junk and chili bowls, you might be addicted!
My personal preference is 4 stars!
