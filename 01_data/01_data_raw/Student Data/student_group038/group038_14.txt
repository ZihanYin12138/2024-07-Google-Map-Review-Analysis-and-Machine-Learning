<Review>I was there today around 12:00 pm. I got to tell the owner of this restaurant that their food is good but their customer service is really bad. The women and the man that work there have no customer service very rude. Before they make fun of their customers they should maybe check if they’re listening or not . It’s too bad because I’m never going there again.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

It’s super high end, chef inspired, fast food Mexican food.  Similar to chipotle but twice as good with much better ingredients. 4 out of 5 stars bc it’s expensive and two veggie bowls will cost you $22. Oof.< /review><name>RJ</name><rating>4</rating>< date>

<Date>1600107373372< /Date><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Food is always delicious, but their service is horrible.  The employees are rude and act like they don't want to work there.  I ordered food at the window and was the only one there for 10 min waiting, and then someone else came up and ordered and got their food ahead of me.  I then asked where my food was and they rudely said it wasn't ready.  I ended up waiting 30 min for my food when it was just me and one other person at 11am on weekday.  When they gave me my food they muttered under their breath.

If you don't want to work there, please don't work there.  You are runing the dining experience for others as you can see by their other reviews.  Management really needs to speak to them as they are in the service industry and not be such bitter employees.</Review>< Pictures>

One of the few walking distance places to eat in that location from where I was (parking's a premium). Food was delicious and reasonably priced. Selection was limited though. Seating accommodations were not a problem (went to lunch around 1 p.m.). Condiments like salt and pepper readily available by the counter. Any other condiments, you need to ask th staff. All in all, I enjoyed the food.<//Text>

I love their food, but the owner needs to talk to the employees.  Their website says they close at 10. I called at 9:15 to place an order.  The lady who answered said "Hi this is Mixto and we are closed and simply HUNG UP" My bf called back and they didn't hang up on him but told him they have new covid hours.  It was a big turn off to get hung up on.  No need to be rude.  Maybe just take the extra 10 seconds and avoid being rude.  That's all.<//text>

<Review>Healthy healthy local fare! Turmeric rice, tasty black beans, zucchini, corn, protein of choice, salsa to your liking, served in a bowl, or wrapped previously in a hefty burrito. All packed caringly for you to bring as you park under a tree by the Silver Lake Reservoir, to forget the plight of our times if only for an hour or so. To enjoy before reading essays by George Orwell, or Rutger Bregman. Hungry for all that is uplifting and intelligent. Don't forget the agua fresca - watermelon and basil. Yes, please. Thank you, Mixto. Truly.< /Review>< GmapID>

Not greasy. It's good, not cheap but quality ingredients. If you're comparing prices to a taco stand you'll be disappointed. If you're conscientious about meat quality then it'll suit your needs. It's very "silver lake" if I could give a vague but descriptive label.< /Review>

Got the chile relleno burrito and some chips with the medium salsa. They don't mess around with the spice, I'll say that much. But it's definitely good food, and the prices are quite reasonable.</review>

Barbacoa tacos was delicious!  Baja fish taco and carne asada were also very good but pretty standard.  There are so many more items in the menu to try, can't wait to come back.
Service was super friendly and the food came out really quick. Nice patio seating. Valet parking for $3 if you cannot find street parking.<//Text>

Yeah I agree with others: food is pretty good but the people here clearly hate their job. When trying to get their attention from the food pickup window, you get the, "what do you want now?" Look, or at least me and another person did. Had to wait for my beverage to be served with my food rather than enjoy it while I wait. Small but nice patio. The good food alone will not keep me coming back here.<//review>

I actually went to the pinkberry next door. Sorry guys. But I remember a burrito bowl that I had delivered from you that wasn't all that hot, so I have to give you three stars because the me from four years ago was underwhelmed. Just being my usual very honest self. That's all. Don't take it personally.< /Review>

Nice place for a snack or lunch. The food is really good and the atmosphere is pleasant.
(Although the parking is very limited and the driveway is very tight, makes it alittle nervous when leaving because of the foot traffic.)<//Review>

What a treat! Cheery, chatty fellow taking your order. Efficient even when there was a small crowd in line. Tasty, heated all the way through food. Well seasoned yet not too spicy. Really enjoyed the music.</text>

I have to give this place 5 stars!
The food is more than acceptable and for the price it is a fantastic value!
The place has a nice vibe too.
Make it part of your go-to lunch spots and you'll always be satisfied!< /review>

I come here often for their kale caesar salad and their bowls. Dressing on the Caesar is super lemony which I love. Ingredients are always fresh and service is quick if you phone in for pick up or delivery.</Text>

This is definitely my go to burrito place. While I’m not vegan, I love their mixrizo option. Unfortunately, i feel like they’ve changed their recipe, but they didn’t ruin it. Their guacamole can stand up to any authentic homemade kind. My absolute favorite is their carne asada. Definitely worth a try and definitely worth repeat business!<//text>

We miss dos burritos but this new place mixto is a new refreshing look at mexican food with some organic ingredients. A little more pricey but they make up for that with the fact that you can add egg to your burrito.parking is kind of hard to get to and that's to bad that liberty bell temple isn't in the back anymore so you could get a mixto and medicate. So please try the place before you make your mind up that you dislike it. I have a feeling that it may make you warm up to it.<//Review>

Super delicious awesome and satisfying! So far I have tried the veggie bowl, soy chorizo & veggie tacos which were all yummy. Produce are fresh & prices aren't to bad. Only need 2 tacos or just a bowl to fill me up.<//Text>

This place is literally a hole in the wall! They have created a great ambiance to grab a quick bite with wooden tables and and an open archway to the street.
I had the pork taco and the fish taco. While the tacos were a bit smaller than I expected for the price I paid, they tasted delicious!

My friend got the carne asada burrito, but wasn't as impressed as I was with my food.
If I am in the area again, I will definitely be coming back for the pork taco!<//Text>

This place sales tacos with no flavor, skinny, pricy, etc. One taco 4.00 something. I asked for carne asada and the meet is dried, no flavor at all. They charge top dollar like they were a nice restaurant and you get to eat where it was a garage. Tacos in front on Seven eleven at Hyperion and Rowena are 1000%, and yes I wrote one thousand much better and one taco is only 1.25 and they are really authentic. Not like mixto that is not latino at all. Shame I paid almost 12 dlls for two tacos.<//Review>

<Text>The food is OK, and the parking is insanely difficult. It's a disappointment compared to the quality when they first opened, when the owner was at the restaurant every day. Now he's never there and the food quality has dropped dramatically. It's decent, but not worth the wait or the price anymore.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I recommend the carne asada burrito with cilantro cream salsa. AND they serve Topo Chico, which, if you haven't tried, is the best fizzy mineral water from Mexico!!!</Text>< user_name>

<Text>Though this is gentrified-gabacho-Latin-fusion-foodfare, this pocha really likes this place! I mean, I'm here like every week! This used to be Burrito King (RIP) and though I was sad to see that place go, I love Mixto's burritos and tacos made with organic humane meats like chicken, pork and beef. Plus, with all the lovely fixins, customers can select a salsa to be added to their meal. Very fresh! Dee-lishhhhh!!! Plus, it's organic!

Besides their tacos and burritos, they also have bowls, which is not something we Latinos are accustomed to. But, we like it anyway. ;) Still great flavors with cilantro, onions, salsa, queso y todo! That's right, vatos locos!

Another special item that can be found here are their fried plantains, also known as maduros in the Cuban world, cooked to perfection, along with a dollop of crema mexicana! So delicate and delicious! I could seriously eat these all the time! (Why does it seem like I'm yelling while  writing this review?)

In addition to the things mentioned above, they have specials like almond horchata. If you haven't tried it yet, you must! It's delicately sweet with a touch of cinnamon and a lovely texture. It's delightful, really.

Plus, they sometimes have great desserts like their key lime pie. Once again, delicately sweet.

In addition to their great food, these folks are doing their part in being eco-friendly, like having different portals for recycling and composting. And if you know me, this brings a smile to this earth-loving gal!

And, the people that work here are awesome! They are so refreshingly nice. So chill and willing to engage in conversation. :)

The prices for the food here are decently priced, especially for what you get! (Burrito King prices?)

The only problem about Mixto is the location. Why? It's located in one of the busiest sections of Silver Lake--right across from the insane Trader Joe's parking lot and near the intersection of Hyperion and Rowena. (If you have driven around this area, you know exactly what I'm talking about!!!). Plus, they have a somewhat smallish parking lot, though I never encountered issues with finding a spot. But, other than this, Mixto is great!

Oh! I forgot to mention that they have a handicapped parking space where a person with a disability can order their meal without ever having to leaving their vehicle. (It's like one of those ordering things found at a drive-thru). So convenient. :)

I love this place!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80c2c0c917ccba59:0x9f94867f22e6b064< /gmapID>< Resp>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The staff was kind, professional and efficient. We went in 40 minutes before closing and they didn't discourage us from ordering but instead invited us to sit and eat. The pizza was dang good, although the crust was a bit thin & crispy. The chicken parmesan was DELICIOUS!!! A bit on the pricey side but you totally get what you pay for! The restaurant was clean and they have beer on tap (i didn't order any, but the people near me had a cold pitcher that looked inviting).< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>This is our favorite pizza place, but the last time we went people were dining inside and without masks even though many of them were not eating.  There was a party of at least 15 people all not wearing masks. There was no distancing at all.</Review>< rate>

Went for the first time for a Deaf event and the service was fast and the food was pretty good only one flaw our pizza rolls were a little greasy but overall delicious after dabbing off the excess. Would definitely recommend.<//text>

Went in with my family and the person at the front and the cook both didn't have masks on. Not good to know that the people handling your food and drinks aren't wearing masks at all, during a pandemic. Disappointed. What makes it most ironic is that there's a sign at the front to not stand by the bar because of Covid.<//text>

Good food, fair pricing, great atmosphere and awesome customer service. I recommend trying their broasted chicken, they also offer a nice lunch special selection.< /review>

We have been patronizing Pizza Royal since I was in high school and we have been coming back for years! Casual, clean, fun, great staff, and delicious food! Great for the entire family with video games in a separate room and new flat screen TVs for the sports lovers. Under new ownership, the place and menu have definitely improved.< /Text>

Pizza was okay, too thin.  I prefer thicker cust, but the taste was good. Not sure if I would come back again.< /review>

Bought a medium pepperoni.  It was the worst pizza I ever had. It took 30 minutes to make when I got it home 10 minutes away it was cold and some of the slices didn't have any cheese and the sauce was dry. Threw it out after 1 slice not even good enough to work for lunch. Total garbage.</review>

Growing up I went here as a T Baller and it still holds a special place in my heart. Delicious, roomy, fun, and decently priced. The staff is always nice and the beer selection is actually pretty good.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I went here last night and it was absolutely terrible. I took my daughter to play some arcade games and get pizza. Only half of the 7 arcade games were working, all of the others were jammed. We got our pizza and it tasted and looked like frozen Red Baron pizza - it was terrible. While trying to consume the pizza, I was bit some kind of flying bug on my leg. Before getting out of there, my daughter had to go to the bathroom. We went into the men's - there was a urinal and a toilet separated by a shower curtain, with no working lock on the door. I would expect this at a dive bar - not a family restaurant. I will not be back.< /Text>

I've coming here for 30 years, growing up in Rancho this place has been a staple for all sports organizations for years as you can see by the many, many team plaques on the walls from over 40 years worth of memories for all involved.

It's always quick friendly service, from the moment you walk in and order, until you're finishing up they check on you to make sure you have everything you need and take away anything you don't.

I've honestly never had a bad experience here, it's great to see that even through ownership change they've kept the family feel my family has come to know and love over the years, all while keeping up to date and growing with the times.

Now I get to bring my son here to celebrate together with the family the same way I did growing up and that's the best thing about this place, 4 generations in and this is still our favorite place to get together.<//text>

The wait is rediculous they only have one oven. Call your order in then go in and eat in. The Royal Special Pizza is different from any I have ever had, a nice change from the regular places we eat at great place for large groups</Text>

We have been going there for so many years our kids have grown up there. Sports activities, birthday parties and still get togethers with High School Friends. Once again they went above and beyond for our celebration of a new grandson to come. The food is consistantly good and the family feeling dromthe staff us what keeps us coming back year after year.

Thanks again PIZZA ROYAL.

This is a great family spot. The pizza, broaster chicken and cinnamon knots are consistently great with service to match. Staff are super friendly and cheerful. Several flat screen tv's for your viewing pleasure. I highly recommend giving this place a try.<//Text>

I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this "restaurant" which is basically a taco stand - we wanted Mexican food one night, and I found it by accident on Grubhub.  We will definitely be ordering again in the future . .  soon!   You can safely give them a try.</Review>

< Review>
Been going here for many years, roughly 10-15 years (?? I've lost track), love that its pretty much the same crew.  Food is delicious, NEVER had a wrong order.  Gotten a little more pricy over the years but still a good deal (I make the drive from Beverly Hills where I work).  I order pickup usually and its always ready and always still hot. Dined in a few times, and everything is kept really clean! Guys that work here are super friendly too!!< /Review>

Tito's is over priced. A rip off of something simple. Campus tacos taste as good... You'll have to add sour cream. Not sure about the burritos. But the tacos... A+<//text>

<text>Very solid place. Giving It a 4 because I tried the nachos and they weren’t that good, but I am excited to try to carne Asada fries which is basically swapping the chips out for fries. Honestly the chips aren’t that good, that’s all it was. I got the burrito and added fries to it and they were so crunchy and potatoey omg! The horchata was on point as well! No picture, I smashed that burrito😂</text>< Rating>

Interesting location, it's right across from a Taco Bell. Anyways, parking was surprisingly easy (paid). Food was greasy, but that's expected. Portions are veryyyyy generous. The guacamole was GREAT! Service was fast and friendly, and the place was pretty clean. There was nothing on the tables and they cleaned up quickly after parties left.</text>

Disappointed! I always eat here at-least once a week but usually order the same item. Decided to order menudo via Postmates and didn’t get any tortillas with it or utensils. The menudo had no flavor deff. Not ordering that again!<//Text>

Now there is one near me on Robertson and I frequent them often they all know my name. They all serve me very quickly and a very friendly and nice come in and I say hi to George and I also gave Frankie the Busboys there I guess he is the best boy I gave him a guitar because I really feel close to these people they're like family.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Deep fried may not be for every one. But Campos hasn't changed in the 30 years I've come here , whereas many others have or dissapeared. It's a sentimental favorite and a must try.</Review>

I have been going here since day one of their opening. Their food is really above par compared to other mom and shop restaurants. The menu reminds me of a michoacan style family restaurant. The super nachos are amazing make sure you order lengua and got myself together as a combo. By the way we are taught down in Jamaica are made on The daily in house. I wonder whose Grandma's recipe they stole for those.<//review>

Campos Tacos was the fast tasty lunch I needed. The portion was generous and I was able to make two meals out of it. The place looked a little simple but I think the food would impress any one. It could use a little bit more colorful decor but I would eat here again for sure.< /review>

Probably my main squeeze for a carnitas plate.  On the way up Robertson, it is always clean like whistle, the guys are first rate BUT, ok but I want them to be friendlier.  I do.  I also think they should prepackage salsas- it's one of those bars that have tiny containers begging a mess. It's always like whistle though, ok?  The guys, the place- clean. Food is an 8 out of 10 and you guys,  the Jamaica is 10+. Prices are good.  Its serious business. 🙊</Review>

I had a very bad experience, the food was not even Mexican, over cooked, a lot of cheap quality food above each other with no taste, pricey for nothing, the staff will not welcome u, there is a young guy with black hair , he is also so rude, I end up throwing my food in the garbage can..</Text>

<text>This has been my go-to place for nachos since I was ditching high school in the early 90's! Campos is a classic west L.A. chain, and the Super Nachos is an awesome amount of food for a great price. Always recommend any of the Campos locations to anyone searching for great local Mexican food!< /text><username>Anacron</username><Rate>5<//Rate><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

I love this Campos! The cheese enchiladas are bomb and the chile relleno burrito wet with enchilada sauce is mouth watering.

Plus the staff is always nice and gets the food out quick!</text>

The torta sucked...the worst I ever had. Was sloppy and the bread wasnt even toasted..they forgot to put tomatoes and avacado on it. I heard just go for the burritos.</text>

Love the food here especially the chicken taquitos. Everything tastes so fresh and authentic. I've been coming for years since it's close to my job. I wish they would deliver though.<//Review>

Very tasty, reasonable prices, good portion sizes, a nice clean place to eat in or get food to go. Nothing fancy, but actually better than many more expensive places 😋</Review>

I ordered a burrito and chips with beans and instead of the guy charging me a side of beans because chips comes with the burrito he charged me a nachos with out cheese which are like 4 dollars more instead of the beans side which cost 2 dollar.  Bad service and the carne asada has no flavor.</Review>

Menudo was good! They forgot our coffees (which were bad), gave us the wrong tortillas, served us on STYROFOAM  (which kills me) but I would go back because it was tasty. Lets not be stingy with reviews here.< /review>

Not enough meat in my burrito i took 4 bites of my burrito before I finally tasted meat and that's never good so I complain to the cashier and he tells me the owner told him to PUT LESS MEAT in the food!! Smh. So I'm never going back there!</Text>

(Translated by Google) The biggest and delicious burrito that I have eaten in all my holy life. Of carnitas definitely. Accompanied with rich horchata water. The service very fast and friendly and with good location. Right in front of a Bell taco so that they realize what is good 😅

<Review>Good food but impossible to get ahold of. Tried calling for 30 minutes and the phone was a steady busy signal the whole time. I think they turn their ringer off at certain times. Going to have to start trying other places.< /Review>< UserId.>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I love their food and service. Exactly what I always order, complete with everything soy sauce, fortune cookies, chili sauce. Including napkins, forks. I've never had to remind the server for the napkins ect. Fresh, hot and well worth the price. Like now and later, I'll eat my plate of food in two sittings. Thank you, so much for the great food.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had never eaten there before asked the person taking the order what she would recommend for a first time buyer and she pointed me twards what I wanted and the food was really good and the price was super reasonable now I go there every Friday get the same thing and am never disappointed sometimes I feel like it’s to much food but still find a way to woof it down! Good food quick service even when it’s busy this place has it together highly recommend this establishment!</review>

But don't dare try to place a order over the phone they leave it off the hook or if it does ring they answer and set it down and walk off. One would think you'd answer the phone left and right trying to get that biz and make that money but I guess not..<//text>< user_id>

< Review>
Best chinese food I've had in a long time. Beef broccoli was amazing. Beef melted in your mouth and the broccoli was a perfect tender.  This will be my absolute go to chinese food. The sweet and sour pork was perfect, not dry or over done.</Review>

Do not go to this place on Sundays. Yes the food is good. But they get crazy busy. The lady looked so confused & unorganized. The parking lot is small. & with social distancing wasn't easy cause you need to stay in line but also don't want to get hit by a car in the parking lot. I waited a an hour, Just for the lady to tell me my food wasn't ready, & she said she didn't know when it would be ready. So I just left. There was abt 15 other ppl out there waited with me. Ridiculous...< /review>

I call at least 15 times before giving up (this isn't my first day trying....ive been trying for a month now). Then the ONE time I finally get through, I'm put on their version of "hold" .. after 18 minutes they hung up on me. I cant even get through again.

I was hoping to finally trying this place. Guess it's not ever going to be possible. I give up trying.<//Text>< Pics>

<Time>1533327662121<//Time><Rate>2<//Rate><Text>Its ok place. You order by plate. Like panda in a way.  Prices are $10 or so depending what you get. Noodles where hard on half of my plate and the other part soft...not sure what happend there. Orders some other stuff but to be honest the food doesnt really have flavor its ehhh. My stomach and my girlfriend started hurting we didnt even finished it half ways and decided to pay and leave. To each their own...but i dont really recommend this place. Staff took a while to ask us what we wanted or what drinks. She was busy talking to someone and laughing. Took around 10 min from time we arrived to getting our drinks and another 10 or so min to get our food. Food looks good but.......</Text>< Pictures>

Was actually pretty good. Doesn't seem to be anywhere in Madera with great to excellent Chinese food. For that i guess it's Fresno or Bakersfield to the south. Gilroy to the North</Review>

I was looking forward to trying this restaurant due to the good reviews.  Boy was I disappointed.  We got take out.  The service was good, but the food was pretty terrible.  The tempura shrimp and egg roll were just lumps of undercooked batter with barely anything inside. The chow mein noodles were gummy and tasteless.  The hot mustard wasn't even hot.  The stellar reviews on here are puzzling.<//text>

Loved the orange chicken... That's an important staple to have if you're going to claim chinese as your food group. The foil wrapped chicken, amazeBALLZ!
Finally!!! Pan fried noodles "well done" done right!
Service was excellent and the restaurant updated interior is nice. Go. Eat. Love.</text>< user_id>

Great customer service, the portions were too much and the food was not great. The noodles were hard and tasted like if they were sitting out for a while and than they just reheated it in the microwave.😬😓 Never again. 😭<//Text>

Clean restaurant.   Quiet atmosphere.  Food is fresh.  I could tell when I went to have lunch there when I gave my order it was cooked to order.  Nothing was frozen.  Vegetables were not mushy.  Nor was there a whole lot of gelatinous,  jelly like, sauce.  None of those noodles in a can. Very reasonably priced.  Lunch specials and dinner family specials.  All meat was very flavorful and tender.</Review>

<review>This was amongst the worst food I've ever had.

I had fried shrimp.  I ate two bites.  It was largely batter and when I looked at it to see how much batter I saw that the poop has not been cleaned.  I'm sick over this.

The sweet and sour pork was about a third of a cup in size.  Of the 20 or so small pieces only about 3 had meat.  The rest were just batter.

The egg rolls appeared to have been wrapped in pie dough. Not thin little wrappers.

I I definately make better rice than this.

The sweet and sour sauce is very mild in flavor.

Really. That shrimp poop.....<//review><name>Kim Devam<//name></record></dataset><record>

I called in an order for 2 meals and egg rolls. They said it would be 15 mins. I waited 40 mins. They charged me $37 and gave me 3 meals. Didn't realize it until after I left. I call to ask what happened and she insists I asked for 3 meals and I did not. I get back to eat the food and there's no napkins, no utensils. The egg rolls are disgusting I almost vomited. The rice and chicken I got isn't much better. Absolutely never ever going here again. Stay away.<//review>

I didn't like the food.  I've had much better and there's no way near what I was told it would be.  Very disappointed.</Review>

I love Chinese food.  I usually got to Fresno or Merced for Chinese food because Madera didn't have any good places to eat at.  That has officially changed.  Fried rice is great I honestly tried to finish all the food but the plate was too big.  Bonus leftover lunch.</review>

So glad we went to try their Chinese food, come to find out it was my favorite Chinese restuarant owners just in a new location with a new name. We'll never go anywhere else again 😍<//Text>

< Review>
Don't know happened? Used to come here very frequently when it first opened and burnt myself out of it. So it's been a while and went back very disappointed. The noodles were drenched in oil or whatever they use just drenched and it was super unappetizing. The rice was under cooked slightly so i got a good spoonful and then the next is hard. I also had the fried Wong tongs where not what I'm used to it was like chips but like a werid batter. Idk sad I won't try them for a while hopefully that it was just a bad chef or a bad day. Madera doesn't have many places so we'll see?< /Review>

< Review>
They have 3 beers for the price of 2 which was a game changer. I got the pork belly noodle bowl which comes with a ton of porkbelly. The sauce was a little watery for my liking and it was pooling near the bottom of the noodles. It was good besides the extra liquid. They also have a decent selection of bottle beer mainly Asian beers and a couple of crafts. Great place to get a noodle fix.< /Review>

Food here are very fresh and yummy. I like the California milk tea a lot, tasty but not very sweet, highly recommend to have a try. The shrimp hot pot is with thick soup and full of seasonal goodies, so does the satay beef hot pot. Noodle is special. Service is thoughful and friendly here. Clean and lovely resturant is a good choice for local and visitor.<//review>

I haven't been here for a while, and i don't why. It is still one of the best noodle places in SGV. Great garlic noodles and side dishes. I should come here more often.<//Text>

<Review>Went here on the weekend to try their fresh noodles and was not disappointed. We ordered the garlic shrimp, the beef stew noodles, and a side of Brussels sprouts. The noodles were fresh and that texture was great. The amount of shrimp in the noodles was generous and the sprouts were well roasted with some kind of honey mustard sauce. The only slight critique was the broth for the beef stew noodle, I tend to prefer mine a little more seasoned. Otherwise, everything was great and I'd definitely come again.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c5210786b29b:0x51e510754a32353</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Yummy noodle dishes. I ordered the mushroom noodle dish since I don't eat meat and it was deliciously filling. Good prices. I really liked the pickled veggie dish for their appetizers. Would defn recommend coming to try this place out!< /Text>

This place can be hit or miss. I've been twice. The service was exceptional once and terrible once. The staff made it right after our terrible second trip there.  The food is very good overall.  The decor is very cool inside. I'm not sure how I'd describe it but I like it.<//Review>

The menu changes often at the beginning but seems to have stabilized. Fries and wings are tasty and good for sharing, drink choices are tasty.

Be sure to like noodles if you come as they don't have many other options as main courses, and most of their noodles are dry noodles not soup noodles.</review>

Cute place with gluten free options so we were all able to eat here. Diverse menu. Music selection was a bit odd, but it added to the quirky vibe.</text>

<text>The food was okay, but the service was very slow. I ordered Dan Dan noodle and I liked the sauce, but the thick noodle isn't exactly my thing. However, the service was very slow. We had to ask for the menu cuz the waiters won't bring any to us. Then after sitting down for 10m and no one come to take our orders, we again had to ask the waiters to bring us some water. And he bought one cup of water for the two of us...</text><name>Athena Pan< /name><gmap_id>0x80c2c5210786b29b:0x51e510754a32353<//gmap_id><UserId.>104218986064334925620< /UserId.>< Time>

The noodles are supposedly hand pulled, I'm no expert so I'll have to take my server's word for it. The noodles were not overly drenched in sauce and I even got a free scoop (small one of course) for free.</text>

<review>Decor was nice and hip, I was excited to try this place.  But let me tell you, the service was slow.  We went on a slow night too...Monday.  Half empty around 8-9PM.  Waitress took forever to come by to take our order.  After she came by to take our order, she forgot the drinks until we were already eating our food, which took over 30+ minutes to come out even though the restaurant was half empty. We ordered two of the most popular noodles according to the waitress.  I ordered the BBQ Pork noodles.  It's literally AMERICAN BBQ SAUCE slathered on pork and dumped into asian noodles.  Is this fusion?  It was not what I expected.  Unfortunately, the food was also not hot.  Barely above room temperature.  It must have been sitting there for a while before it got brought out.  The entire experience was just soured by the slow service.  If the food had been amazing, it would have warranted the bad service. The fact that the food wasn't even hot, well, go figure.  Maybe that was a service issue as well.  I did notice other people ordering the hot pot dishes, so maybe we just ordered the wrong thing.</review><time>1506992244627<//time>< UserId.>

Their beef noodle soup is the best around. The noodles are fresh and chewy, and the beef is tender and marbled. The beef in the beef noodle soup is worth coming for alone.</Review>

tl;dr:
-Great local noodle shop: lots of options (stir fried). Noodle soup options limited.
-Friendly service: they go above and beyond!

PARKING: Shared private lot or street

FOOD:
Taiwanese beef noodle soup: I've definitely had my fair share of beef noodle soup, and I do like Honey Badger's broth more than others. They give a heaping portion of beef, but their noodles themselves leave a bit of longing for a slightly thinner noodle.
Fontina cheese noodles: I've always told my boyfriend that noodles and pasta are not so different, and this dish proves it. Think of a great mac and cheese made with chewy noodles - definitely a hit. Make sure you add bacon to amp up the flavor!

SERVICE: Very friendly. Our server was very interactive and made sure to suggest some options that he thought we would enjoy. They also offered samples of new test drinks which I thought was a nice touch. Stellar focus on customer service.

TIP:
-Great place if you like customization. You can build your own stir fry noodle plate!</text>

Ordered szechuan style cold noodles. It was okay.. Barely had any flavor, even though I asked for "strong". I was expecting something like the chili cold noodles at szechuan impression and chengdu taste. I like my noodles firm, but not too chewy, eating these noodles was very difficult. Tried the other foods and they are so-so.<//Review>

The absolute worst.  I went in with my 90 year old mother to get her a new Apple phone.

1.  I told them that I could not buy the phone on-line because my computer would freeze on one of their disclaimer frames.  They said well you have to do it on line.  After much discussion, they said okay we will do you a favor and you can buy it from us, but it is an extra $20 activation fee over the on-line price.

2.  I told them the exact phone that I wanted.  The saleslady kept pulling out the correct Apple Se with the wrong storage amount.  I kept telling her that the computer says that you have this phone with 128 mb memory.  She repeatedly said that they did not have one.  Finally, she went back again to look and said, "Oh, there was one in the back."

3. They would not simply let  us swipe mom's credit card.  They said we are contactless.  How does her swiping a card cause a risk of disease.  Finally they told me I had to do it for her all on line through one of their links.  What a pain. (It was also interesting that they are supposedly afraid of disease, but one of the salesladies kept touching me on the shoulder until I asked her to stop.)

4. I wanted them to do a data transfer and they refused.  They told me how to do it, but I told them my mother does not have her apple password and I cannot retrieve it today.

My mother and I were both irritated.  A few hours later, mom decided that she would just return it.  She went back to the store and was told that there was a $50 restocking fee because it was opened.  My mother never opened the box or activated the phone.  They opened the box to get the serial numbers and put on the otter box and cover.  (As my mom left, they told her that Apple would help her with the transfer.  Mom said why not say that in the beginning???   The answer was, "We do not like to refer you to our competitors."

They also opened the phone we did not want that had less storage.  I am surprised they didn't want a charge for that

Lesson learned.  Just go to Apple.<//text>

<review>Switched from another carrier due to limited coverage where I live.  Verizon offers wider coverage area. The sales representative was top notch.  Patient (had to connect 4 phones with different coverage, knowledgeable ( on devices, coverage, rebates and even rebates offered from place of work and efficient.  It was a 3 day process due to issues with previous carrier.  Everyday that I went in the sales staff were friendly and prompt.  My sales representative was always available and friendly.  Granted they are making a sale.  But every customer was treated this way, even the guy next to me that needed technical support for his phone.  I even called customer support and received the same service.  THE PIECE OF MIND IS WELL WORTH IT.< /review><rate>5< /rate><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1534293771027<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Quite sedate this afternoon around 230. So plenty of help available. That's what I like about Verizon stores, there are always enough people there to help. I was there to pick up my new Samsung Galaxy S9+. It was brought to me promptly. At this time in also bought a screen protector and case both were offered to be installed and I accepted. Customer service was excellent and I would highly recommend this location to all i come into contact with.<//Text>

Have been extremely frustrated with the Verizon signal Network out here in Palm Springs ever since I moved out from Los Angeles.  I spoke to Verizon tier 2 support and they told me to go to the store where as one of the gentleman there gave me a new SIM card and tweaked a couple other things in my phone network that were done incorrectly and now I get much much better. Signal and for work this is basically a game-changer it was a lifesaver just the simple thing that they did.< /Review>

<review>This is a good place to purchase your Verizon phone product and accessories or to change aspects of your current phone plan. The staff is very knowledgable of those particular items. If you experience techincal issues with your phone however, you need to contact tech support directly. This is strictly a sales outlet. Don't expect much help here to resolve any tech issues after the sale.</review><UserId.>117739446751014060677</UserId.></record>

I entered the Verizon store, gave my name and in less than 2 min they called my name. I was speaking to my customer service person, nice smile, clean looking, looked at me and talked..I made a list for my questions, she showed me how to clear up my errors..I extended my answering messages..and etc.
I was disappointed that Verizon no longer will go with you to your car and set up your blue tooth! I was referred to go to the dealer for this.
Too bad the owner of the Veh cannot sign a Waiver releasing the Verizon Rep to set up your vehicle for blue tooth. Instead of causing your customer to drive 10 plus miles to a dealership to address this bluetooth/phone matter.
Aside from that, again, I had a very nice female rep help me, she was patient, and I left there happy.
This store is located at THE RIVER"" where PF CHANGS, CHEESECAKE FACTORU, BABES, and The YARD HOUSE, DRINGS BAR, THE RANCHO MOVIE THEATER AND MANY MANY STORES ARE. THE verizon faces Bob Hope Dr., in Rancho Mirage, CA 92270.
This is a VERY NICE, CLEAN STORE, With great personalities with all the employees .
Love this store.<//Review>

My husband and I switched from Sprint to Verizon about a week ago. Mitch really took the time to show us every available option & answered all our questions very thoroughly. We picked the phones (2 x Galaxy Note 3), saw what amount of data we averaged at Sprint, selected our data packages, bundled our blue tooth headsets, screen protectors & cases together and left very satisfied and happy with our purchases. Mitch had even searched deep into our old phones to find picture albums that didn't make the 1st transfer attempt. Ask for Mitch for an amazing experience!< /Text>

HORRIFIC!!!!  Just left Rancho Mirage store (at The River) Vicente was the NASTIEST ever.  representative who "helped" me.  I have been in real estate sales for over 40 years and am still rated in the top 1% of the sales force in the US.
I am a world traveler.  Why did I write this?  My experience with Vicente
was the VERY WORST EVER as I was TRYING to buy a new phone.
Too much to write - just BELIEVE ME.  I have been going to this store for
over 15 years.  This sales representative needs to be FIRED!!!!< /review>

I have been a customer since 1983. I barely walked in when Cindy the greeter immediately tried to discourage me to wait. Said there is a 30 min wait. You'd me to come back after 12:30 it 1:00. I said should I make an appt and she said well I don't know are you coming back. Do snotty. I have worked with your sand canyon Verizon have been in ashes and customer service my whole life. She would be out if there<//review>

(final update) Complete redemption from yesterday's one star rating (see below). This morning I went in and had a young man named Mike help me. Between Mike and Michael, the manager, they were able to get me the most amazing deal I've ever had with my many years with Verizon. I got my phone with a cover and glass screen, an extra gigabyte on my data plan, and I'm paying less than I was before!  My out-of-pocket was less than I was prepared for had I done my $99.00 two-year-contract upgrade.  For another $50 I was able to get a 4G tablet with a $10.00/month data plan, and it's also a mobile hot spot. They were both very thorough, explaining to me exactly how the plan worked, any costs that would look suspicious (but weren't), and how this deal was actually possible without being magical or straight up BS.  I highly recommend this location and these gentlemen, and they have earned a new loyal customer.  BTW, I checked Verizon online and my bill is exactly as they described it.

(first update) I'm going back to the store this morning to pick up the phone. If the outcome is good I will happily upgrade my rating.

(first post) One star: I went to the store today to upgrade my device. The guys were immediately attentive, and one man came out with his tablet to help us. When I told him I wanted the $99 Droid Turbo with a two-year contract (my old one expired and has been month to month for a long time) he told me that couldn't be done in the store, but online - which makes total sense. When I told him I could buy it online from our phone and pick it up in his store he said that's not possible, that they ship it to me.  I was pretty certain that was incorrect, but what are you going to do?  We went to eat and came home.  It's a 16 mile round trip. Guess what?  I ordered the phone online when I got home and within 15 minutes had an email telling me my phone was ready to be picked up at that same store.  Another 16 mile round trip, and another chunk of time out of my days.  I could have bought it, eaten, and picked up my phone in an hour's time, and saved time and gas.<//text>

<Text>I've been a loyal customer for years, but I am now switching my NINE LINES to T-Mobile. My story is way too long to explain, but I've been going back and forth with Verizon customer service, the store manager, and the representative that helped me due to all the charges that were being added to my plan!! Over 6 hours on the phone! I am not happy with how they lied and treated me over the phone, and how I was lied to when I first got the tablets in the store when the representative herself said that my bill would actually be 5 dollars less of what I was already paying for. WRONG!!! It went up 40 dollars more! Know you're facts!!!

Point is Verizon sucks now. Overly priced. Hidden charges and the list goes on and on.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dafdf2ff481b83:0x68ce4f52d9728229<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Review>I was extremely dissatisfied with store associate Lisa's attitude and lack of customer service when trading in my old iPhone to add credit to my account. I got the impression that I was Inconveniencing her from the beginning. She appeared annoyed throughout the transaction. When it came time to reimburse my account,  she ended up making the situation more complicated all due to the fact that she didnt verify my account information. In the end, It was left up to me to call customer service to fix her mistake. Luckily the two customer service representatives from head quarters were able to properly, quickly and respectfully bring my issue to a resolution and correct the problem.< /Review><username>Sara H</username><gmapID>0x80dafdf2ff481b83:0x68ce4f52d9728229</gmapID><Rate>1< /Rate><response>None< /response>< UserId.>

<Review>I recently went into the Rancho Mirage Verizon store to activate three new lines. Roger Hummel, our Solutins Manager was efficient, professional, and helpful.
He took our current plan and worked with me to transition three lines over from a new carrier.
I highly recommend this store when conducting Verizon business. Thank you Roger for your help!</Review>< pics>

<Text>They are deceptive and deceitful, stay away from Verizon Wireless @ The River in Rancho Mirage. Rt after Christmas went there to get the iphone6 plus. Sales Rep Cesar represented to me that I didn't need to pay ANYTHING upfront (nothing on taxes, etc. even tho I told Cesar the  Verizon Palm Springs store told me I would have to).  "Not them" he said, "not necessary". FOUR TIMES I asked Cesar and he told me no worries "my first bill would be pro rated"to reflect taxes & equipment. Instead Cesar repeatedly tried to get me to upgrade my service and buy "extras". Left w/ the phone and ONE WEEK LATER got slammed w/ a bill from Verizon for $227.56.!!  Not a "service bill" but a tax and equipment bill. I called Cesar and he said "I told you your first bill would be pro rated". Since when does pro-rated no longer mean a fraction of a larger bill and instead equals TWO TIMES what my regular bill is estimated to be!?!?  TWO TIMES LARGER than my regular bill! His manager, Jose, was absolutely no help either.  Shameful. The kick in the pants is after dealing in the store w/ Cesar, I walked over to the manager and told him how terrific Cesar was in getting me the phone right away, complimented him on service set up and more. Then just a week later get slammed with a bill Cesar told me I would not get after I asked him FOUR TIMES if I would.  Any of this sound pro-rated to you? Or honest and upfront?  Sounds deceptive, deceitful, and denying real costs to get me to buy "extras" after repeatedly telling me the Palm Springs wireless store recommendation to pay taxes up front was plain wrong and not necessary (PS said the up front would be $102 and NOT $227.56).  I feel really cheated and lied to by Cesar and got no support from Jose the manager who never called me back. They are not nice people but sure make you think they are.  Real nice from a Verizon "corporate owned" store.  Makes me really sorry I switched over from AT&T when this is how they treat their customers. Shame on Cesar & Jose in Rancho Mirage wireless store at The River. Shame on Verizon. Stay away from Verizon Wireless @ The River and especially Cesar &  Jose!!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>We just bough an I- phone 7 for my daughter 4 days ago from this store and the day after we bought it my daughter told me that the home button is overheating and it had a small crack on it that is getting bigger the more she uses the phone. She went back to the store the next day to exchange it and the sales person she talk to informed her that because the home button had a crack they won't be able to exchange it. Today I went to the store with her and spoke to the manager Isabel  Ochoa. She informed me she won't do an exchange because of the crack and wasn't willing to take under consideration that we bought the phone within Verizon's "worry free grace period' which is 14 days of the purchase. She also didn't take under consideration that the home button overheats, but used the crack as an excuse not to do the exchange. She had an attitude with me like she holds all the power and there is nothing I can do to make her exchange the phone. I've had bad experience in that store before, but I was never this upset as to write a bad review. The Verizon store at the River in Rancho Mirage is one of the worst in customer service and I will never go back there.</review><Rating>1<//Rating><time>1485481431842< /time><Gmap_id>0x80dafdf2ff481b83:0x68ce4f52d9728229<//Gmap_id>< Pictures>

<text>Very unfriendly from the get go. My mother (not tech savvy at all) was referred by the rep at Costco to receive help finishing up set up on her new iPhone. She spoke to 3 reps and each was more unfriendly then the last. Once they found out she did not purchase her phone with them they wanted nothing to do with her and also repeatedly told her they *HAD* to charge her a fee for the assistance. To top it off they didn't actually do anything and said she should go to the Apple store. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS LOCATION THEY DO NOT DESERVE YOUR BUSINESS.<//text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>Terrible customer service everytime I have ever been in this location at The River, I recommend everyone go to LaQuinta if seeking a Verizon Corp location! Corporate Office may want to spend some time in the  location at the River working on proper customer service skills.

When I bought my phone online, Verizon promised me a $50 rebate. When I sent in the rebate info, they denied the rebate and said they never said that. check it out. You cannot get your rebate from Verizon. I never had a smart phone and had no idea how to use it. When I came into Verizon to learn how to set it up the clerk took it out of my hand and set it up and handed it back to me and said "there."<//Review>

This is BS because I could have done this online. What she did was to purposely increase her activation numbers. With this action, it forced a deletion of all of my voicemail messages that have been saved for business. She also forwarded my voicemail to an old home phone number that I haven't had for 18 months. Needless to say, this cost me an extreme amount of frustration, lost business, and possible future lawsuits due to loss of saved voicemail messages. Beware when you come here and make sure you are very clear on what they are doing...<//text><date>1395420288862<//date><resp>None</resp>< user>

I always send one of my Managers to this location as it is the only one near us, today he went in to pick up a sim chip like he has multiple times before and he was "greeted" by ROGER who was extremely rude and agonized him making jokes for the store to hear about how he wasn't going to get anything from them and the owner better come down and get it themselves. Customer service for the businesses accounts jumped on it immediately and called the store and go them straitened out when my manger went back in, ROGER confronted him and almost sounded threatening for us making a call. The fact that a regular employee feels they can act like that to paying customers obviously shows that their management team has no type of control over their staff. Horrible store.!</Review>

Had a rude experience there yesterday with Kareem. He doesn't seem to like his job had no desire to help me with my issue. Was very put out by the issue and never said anything about the inconvenience I had been thru, just didn't care. Couldn't even say bye. Very rude.< /text>

<date>1322851177230</date><text>Very disappointing with the service of Verizon at this store. Had them transfer info to replacement phone because volumne on Droid Bionic would not turn up. First none of my tele numbers were transfered, then none of my apps were transfered. The people that work there look at you like you are an idiot. Finally left after over an hour working on my phone, to only have my phone stop working over night and missed appointments this morning. Called Verizon can't get a phone until Monday this is Friday, Or they can overnight ship it to me if I pay $20. They sent me a reconditioned phone that doesn't work and then they want to charge me for sending another phone so I will not be without a phone for three days and am going out of town.</text><user_name>Linda Nichols</user_name>< UserId.>

Always have dealt with RUDE and very non-helpful people at this
Store.   They seem to think that they are working in a shoe store,
their lack of knowledgeNissan so huge.< /Text>

Horrific experience, if I could go to another one I would. But it's the closest to my house.
Worst customer service, their employees and management don't care about giving you a deal. The also have major attitude. Will no longer be a Verizon customer after my contract is over.< /Review>

I absolutely love this place! Was awesome! I had a pedicure and Manicure.  Very humble and thoughtful.  Very caring for her customers.  She gives the best massage on my feet and hands.</Text>

I don’t recommend this place because of the horrible customer service. It was busy so I understand having to wait, but I guess they started noticing multiple customers waiting they began to just seat us and put the acrylics on. After that they had you waiting with glued nails, I guess they did that so you wouldn’t leave. When they finally came back the lady doing my nails began and my nails broke TWICE in the process. The end product looked cheap and the nails were weak!! I took them off the next day because I didn’t like how they looked or feel.<//Text>

Good work ,talkative just sometimes distracted by many calls  and does 2 people at a time...introduced me to color changing nails...
@tovarcorazon follow me to see pictures of there work color changing nails. I just cheated on them with melody nails.i wanted to see if it would be cheaper.. 10 by us cheaper but I'm guessing because it wasn't color changing.</review>

Wanted to like this place, but they failed. First and last time here unfortunately. When i arrived  it was empty, they sat me and started working on my nails soon after three more girls walked and it became a race to the finish line. The technician then started working on the other girls Simultaneously all at the same time....pretty much playing musical chairs! I think they need to stop multitasking and concentrate on one customer at a time. Trust me im used to waiting at a nail salon, im not gonna leave if i have to wait half an hour for my turn. My nails are all different shapes and sizes and dont feel like they’ll last very long. We will see how they hold up. Pricey too i payed $25 for  a set no gels no design simple polish.</Review>

Horrible customer service… Don't listen to what you want at all. They kept trying to force a design on me and I didn't want it. And they kept burning my hands with that UV  light after my gel manicure. I have gotten gel manicure before at other salons and it never bUrns. Julie left my nails all uneven... i am super pissed because i paid 40 dollars for a manicure and it really was NOT worth it!!!  I would not recommend this place to anybody… Stay away! They jacked up  my sisters manicure as well…</Review>

It doesn't even deserve a star...bad really bad experience. Wish I can show a picture of how the man did my nails, I was so mad I wanted to walk out with the plain nails, the man was trying to do 3 persons at the same time...he wouldn't pay attention on what he was doing, nails where crooked and not even coffin top shape..the one lady was all trying to fix them but..it wasn't what I paid for. Never going again. To finish it off the man lies saying he doesn't have the nail polish unless you tell him you are going to like a dance or somewhere important he then takes all the other nail polishes, we had to lie because he wouldn't give us the color we had asked for or ge suggest a color and like pressures you to get that color..No wonder it was empty when we went.. I highly don't recommend it..on top of that paid $40 for his bad work and $38 for some plain nails..oh!! And talk about burning your finger nails with the uv light.. it keeps going..I don't recommend this place.< /Text>

Major thanks to Dr. Franco and the medical team at this location. Dr. Franco was spot on with her diagnosis and treatment for my condition. I feel the staff on the morning of my appointment were very kind, courteous and professional. And I feel confident I'm on the road to recovery.
Thank you!< /text>

Concerned I had broken one of my ribs so I went here (it's close to work). Intake process with Hailey was professional and quite fast - she was the only one who truly took me seriously. Charge Nurse on duty that night took report from her and explained it was likely tendonitis. The x-ray tech helped me get into position for the specific area I was concerned with. While waiting for the results of the x-ray, heard the staff joking about my concern through the closed door. Turned out to be 2 broken ribs. Do yourself a favor and get professional medical care elsewhere. What a shame to see this is what Cedars-Sinai has become.</review>

<Text>Horrible experience:
My primary care recommended that I get a COVID test, and since he is also at C.S., I naturally (and naively) opened the CSLink app to schedule a test there.
When I arrived, they made me stand in a line indoors with everyone else who was coming for COVID testing. Then they checked me in, and the whole scam started.
A nurse came in to take my blood pressure and temperature before the test, and told me that it is required before I take the test.
Then she said a doctor will come talk to me after the test. She then left and came back to ask me to move to a different room because the doctor now wants to see me before taking the test.
I move to a different room and a nurse comes in to talk to me about my symptoms while performing a routine stethoscope check.
When I told her that I was confused about what’s happening, she said “this is an urgent care visit. We don’t just do a PCR. We need to make sure you’re okay”, and when I objected saying that I didn’t book an urgent care visit but a PCR test on their app, she brought someone from administration who showed me that one of the fine prints on the agreements says that I will also be seen by a nurse during the visit, which means that I, and my insurance, will be billed as an urgent care visit.
It is sad to see how a hospital with such a good reputation resorts to the snake oil practice of bait and switch.
Some genius in administration figures that since urgent care visits are down, let’s force the patients that we are concerned about to do a mandatory visit when they come in for a COVID test.
That’s how they care about you: they put you through the same rooms and have you checked by the same people who checked everyone else who came for that test. That’s how they make sure that if you don’t already have it, you’ll go home with it for sure.
Everything that is wrong with a business operating as a hospital,  trying to extract as much value as possible from its customers (I mean patients) at any expense< /Text>< pictures>

This urgent care has one of the worse management I have ever seen. There is favoritism within the urgent care and no respect from management. Hire people who have a real degree and aren't just a LVN. Supervisors need experience dealing with patients, healthcare professionals, and how to give real interviews.<//Text>

We saw Dr. Goings with our 10 mo old and she was an absolutely amazing doctor! She was personable and seemed genuinely concerned about our daughter. She listened to our concerns and did the appropriate exams to correctly diagnose her illness. With Dr. Goings and nurse Juanita’s help our daughter felt better within a day after we began her treatment. She had been sick for a week. I am so thankful for the amazing healthcare provided by Dr. Goings and Juanita!<//Review>

WORST EXPERIENCE. LUCKY MY DAUGHTER DIDNT DIE OR GET INJURED AFTRR SHE PASSED OUT VOMITING TO BE SEEN WITH NO MEDICAL AID IN SIGHT FOR 10 MINUTES.

I TOOK HER OUT OF THERE AFTER AND TOOK HER TO BEVERLY HILLS URGENT CARE.

What a difference!!!! She was seen by the nurse- there were 5 of them in front to aid with URGENT care as the facility is.

Linked to the CS system, if you are in their system it’s great. No paperwork to fill out or things like that. I came here because it’s so seamless, as in you can pay your bill in one place and your primary Dr. can look up your urgent care visits right away.< /review>

Unlike an emergency room it's a more personal atmosphere. I recommend highly that you get here at 11:30 a.m. if you can. They open the doors at about 10 minutes to noon and if you are there early they see you right away. You cannot say that for an emergency room even at Cedars-Sinai. The doctors are incredibly proficient and the staff handles you with courtesy and regard for your time.< /text>< pics>

Based on my observations and experiences on multiple occasions the doctors and nurses and staff are very good and knowledgeable and also very courteous, and the facility is neat and clean with good amenities. Parking is easy. Overall a great quality place. This refers to the Wilshire location.< /Review>

Very impressed. Unfortunately our 2-year old son fell and we needed to bring him in for stitches. we arrived at 7:45 pm on a Tuesday.  Parking was easy, right around the building, with validation. We saw four "customers" in the waiting room and we were seen within 10 minutes of arrival. Nurse took vitals and doctor was very patient and kind.  We had to decide between stitches vs glue, and the doctor explained the differences and pros and cons. Since this laceration was questionable, she said she would like to bring a second opinion to help decide. We were very impressed since it was late in the day and she could have selected either option. But they were very patient and made sure to do things carefully and right. HIGHLY recommended!!</Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>This has been my go-to since moving to Manhattan almost a year ago. The staff is always friendly and efficient. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes to see a doctor. Even though it's a walk-in facility and they see a lot of people every day, you really feel like they take the time to work with you and listen because they really care.<//review>< pics>

< review>
I had a great experience here on the 4th of July when I came in with a really irritated and red eye.

Because it's a Cedars Sinai location, I was worried a visit here was considered a trip to the emergency room and would be very expensive. Instead, my health insurance provider recommended this location for urgent care. My insurance told me to first call to re-confirm they took my insurance. They did. They take all PPO insurance.

The wait was 10 minutes. The clinician,  Mr. Turnipseed, asked lots of questions about my eye and had a look at it with a fluorescent light. He prescribed an eyedrop for allergies. It is literally 2 hours later and it feels 95% fixed.

The quality of care I received was better than most non-urgent care physicians I visit. This was for a chronic condition, so lot of doctors have tried lots of things over the years. This clinician listened to me and found a solution that everyone else missed. TRY THIS PLACE!< /review>

Walked in st 5:30pm on a Sunday and I was called 10 minutes later and saw the DR. And out of there by 6pm. They validate parking and very professional. Receptionist had no personality, very serious and boring but professional. The nurse and the doctor were great.< /Review>

<Text>My Cedar Sinai doctor office sent me here at 10 a.m. This URGENT CARE works on bankers hours.  Opens at NOON! What idiocy!

By 10:30 there were 8 patients in the hallway.  Least they could do is to open the waiting room instead of patients having to stand or sit on the floor for hours!!@<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Great selection. The young man who assisted me, Marvin, was very knowledgeable, attentive to my needs and I bought everything that I was looking for there. Super good prices too! Check them out if you need furniture!!<//Review>

We went in looking for a new mattress and ended up purchasing a new sofa and love seat too.  We were impressed with their selection and the prices were so reasonable.  We had our furniture delivered that same day - the delivery men even stayed late to make sure we got it to our house and got it set up.  We'll shop there next time we need furniture.< /review>< rating>

<Text>Update: Derek was amazingly helpful. I got an upgraded dresser and he even delivered the new one for me. Great management shift!

Over priced for the quality of product. The front of my dresser just popped off staples and all and I was sold it without all of the screws. For over $200 youd think I would have it for more than three months. Waste of money.< /Text>< Pics>

These guys were great. No hard sell. I bought a reclining couch. And, they returned the couch for full store credit after over a month when it just wasn't fitting me quite to my liking. They delivered and picked it up! Courteous and fair.< /text>

I have been shopping in this store for years!  They are having their 30th anniversary sale now, and I think I have been shopping there since they opened.  I love this store because it has such good prices and a good selection.  They stand behind what they sell, which means so much.</Text>

< Review>
Went to Holbrook’s a couple months back in the hopes of an inexpensive mattress. I found inexpensive but it was most definitely at the cost of the quality. Not even a full week into having the mattress, I started to notice countless bug bites all over my body. I started considering the possibilities of how I might have gotten them because I didn’t want to jump to the conclusion that the mattress gave me the BED BUGS (spoiler alert: it did). After arriving at the conclusion that it was in fact the mattress— this was after mulling over that I had been living in the same place for a year prior, none of my guests or neighbors had bed bugs, none of my house mates had bed bugs, and I hadn’t introduced any new furniture or used belongings that possibly could have had bed bugs— I gave Holbrook’s a call. I informed them of the situation and to my dismay, was “reaffirmed” by the store owner that all mattresses are certified and sanitized in a factory. Sidenote, the person I spoke with was also very rude, short, and payed no interest to the customers overall experience with his business. I was offered store credit as they don’t offer refunds but who in their right mind would buy again from a place that has bed bugs?
I’ve also just read a different review that accuses the store of having bed bugs where the owner commented something along the lines of “never ever having bed bugs.” Unfortunately, this is false and if I thought it was appropriate to attach photos of the bites I had covering my body after having the mattress for 2 days, I would.
Lastly, as I was taking the bed to the dump, I noticed some “used” labels. To my knowledge, the store does not advertise that their beds are used nor was I informed that I was getting a used mattress upon purchasing.

I’ve read through some of the other reviews and my experience does not seem to be unique. I’m writing this review in the hopes that customers won’t spend their money at a place that takes part is such poor business habits. If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.
(P.s this review is also on Yelp with some photos attached of the secondhand/used labels I found on the mattress)</Review>

You waited "a few months" after the so-called fact and then at 10:30 on a Sunday night you write your one and only Google review to complain?  I don\'t believe for a minute that you were ever sold a used mattress that had  bed bugs.   I don\'t believe for a minute that you didn\'t demand a refund if you even THOUGHT that happened.  Contrary to your statement, we do give refunds. I don\'t believe for a minute that you ripped off tags from a supposedly bed bug infested mattress and saved them for "a few months" to write a review. I don\'t believe for a minute that the store owner told you all of the mattresses we sell are used, because they ARE NOT! I don\'t believe for a minute that you would let it go when supposedly you bought a mattress with bed bugs, were told you couldn\'t have a refund, and then never contact us again!!  You would just wait a few months and then write a review?   I do believe, however, that you own a certain competing store and are continuing your harassment game. This is getting old. Please stop.'}<//Response>

We’ve been shopping at Holbrook’s furniture store for years now. I always love the special attention that we got from the assistant manager Derek (Who is now, I understand the new manager).  Whenever we didn’t find what we were looking for, Derek has always encouraged us to look through the catalog or their website.  Even now that we no longer live in Chico, we still order furniture through Holbrooks.  Last year we bought a vacation home and bought the majority of our furniture through one of the Holbrook websites.  Again we were so impressed with the professionalism and knowledge of Derek.
Their prices are very reasonable and the furniture is very well-made.  A delivery date was set and the truck arrived on time and was professionally unloaded and set up in our home.  I can’t recommend the store more.<//Text>

<review>We had a fast delivery from respectful and trustworthy people bring what we got from the store exactly how we saw it. I bought my first couch and bed from Holbrooks today, I am more than satisfied with the furniture, workers, and deal I got! Their workers were trustful and left in my cammed rooms alone while watching my cameras; they werent at all weird, didnt look around our rooms, listened to how/where I wanted everything, took my old furniture, and were very kind to my animals. I cannot wait to get more furniture here!!!!!< /review>< pictures>

Great furniture but the owners are very opinionated of who walks in the door and very quick to Judge by  appearances. Other then that the furniture quality is great & low priced. You get what you payed for.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I needed to buy a new dining table because the ex took the old one.  I went in to the Chico store and they had a nice one on the floor for a great price.  It had a little scrape of white paint on the side which they said they thought they could get off.  Sure enough they delivered it the next day and there was no trace of that little white paint.  Looked perfect.  So, this was the Chico store and an in stock item, but my experience was excellent.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

If I were able to give this store less than one store I would. I was told a price on the phone so I drove the hour there for a specific item. When I got to the store the the manager who apparently is the second in charge for the holbrooks jacked the price up 3 hundred more dollars and told me tuff luck either purchase it at that price or leave. He was extremely rude and unprofessional. Totally had the im better than you attitude. I strongly suggest people to avoid this store. You are just a number with a wallet no customer care at all. Might as well purchase from a big chain store.DO NOT SUPPORT THIS STORE< /review>

< Review>
I ordered and paid for a couch on December 14th with the promise from Holbrooks that it would be delivered within 5 to 6 business days. I clarified that I needed the couch before Christmas because I have family coming over and only 2 chairs in my living room. I was promised it would be here in plenty of time. I called on the 22nd (the 6th business day after ordering) because I had not heard from them. They assured me that it would be on the truck coming on the 23rd and would be delivered either the afternoon of the 23rd or the 24th. I called again in the afternoon on the 23rd and they told me the truck was running late and it would definitely be delivered on the 24th between 12 and 4pm. I have received no phone calls and now it's after 4pm on Christmas eve and I still have no couch. They are closed so I'm assuming I will not have a couch tomorrow. I am pissed because I could have gotten a different couch in a second choice color from a different retailer. I should have done that :(< /Review>

<review>Wow!  Floored by these criminals.  I went to help a neighbor with the issue and all I can say is WOW.  They refuse to give him his $700 deposit back and then tell him they are not giving them the furniture either.  Jim Maxxwell is the worst!!!  We are taking them to small claims court to get the money back... CROOKS!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I bought four chairs and waited almost a month for them.  I had to constantly call them and find out what was going on with the items purchased.  In addition, they are usually hours late on the delivery service which makes for a conflicting experience.< /Text>

But as you’ve probably gathered by now, this is a piece about wiener schnitzel. If veal is a problem for you, I will tell you that you can always make a very nice schnitzel from pork tenderloin. And if you don’t eat meat at all, this is probably not an article for you. That’s about as far as I’m going to wade into this issue. For me and my family, there will always be veal, and that may mean you don’t like me. I apologize<//Text>

I don't like the cheese slices bc I don't like American cheese, but the chili dogs are AMAZINGGGG Also going just for cold snacks in summer is fun. I usually stop there for ice cream with my bf and sis and we love it. Perfect pitstop for sweet icecream or delicious food< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

I'm not saying you will get shot, however the neighborhood isn't the safest so approach with caution. Food is tastes really good and it is decently priced so I would recommend you visit the franchise.< /Review>< pictures>

<rate>2< /rate><review>I asked for onions on my chilli dogs threw  the  drive thru window, so  I checked before leaving and realized that there was none. So I walked in to say that I didn't have no onion and the person in the back that fixed them just tossed out onions in a cup. I didn't appreciate this type of customer service being that I come here on a regular basis.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Service is good,although prices are getting higher than a fancy restraunt. Average cost is min 11.00$ per person. That's with a combo family package and drinks. Not individual prices.</review>< GmapID>

<review>If your craving a hot dog or some chili cheese dog, burger or fries this is definitely the place to come. The customer service here is pretty good. The great thing about Wienerschnitzel is the send coupons in the mail so you can always find a coupon that'll suite your appetite or your families appetite. The drive thru moves pretty quick as well.<//review>< Pics>

Do not go to wienerschnitzel in san Bernardino on university parkway! Went there today and tried to order 3 $6 meals, they do not honor specials like their suppose to. They told me it was a max 2 per customer. This is not true for the $2/$4/$6 meals. I called railto location and confirmed.</Text>

The staff at this Wienerschnitzel is always pleasant and courteous! I sometimes just do "drive thru" but on a hot day it's nice to actually go inside and take a break while relaxing with a Root Beer Float along with that hot dog!< /review>

I tryed the chilli cheese & beef tamale it was a little to spicy next time i will have the chili and cheese on the side. I like the music the wooden seats and the overall decoration the mirror on the south wall needs to be cleaned occasionally.<//Text>

Havent been for a while...Chili combo ( burger, hot dog and fries)
sounded good..but almost 10 bucks!...chili tasted watered down. No good kick like before.  Disappointed. However, fast drive through and friendly staff</Text>

Hot dog stand with limited indoor & outdoor sesting. Good food and prices.  Drive through. College community (UCR) with many dining establishments (fast food & sitdown), and multi-screen theater.< /text>

< review>
Same experience as the woman below me. We went to go grab something quick but my bf had to use the restroom. They denied him although I was in line. Said something dumb af along the lines of, ‘we use to let people use it then the toilets started to break’. Honestly it’s fine, their food is high in my opinion, and nasty. I caught the cook digging in someone’s fries with her bare hands.🤮 I work in the same parking lot And patronize this business often. Never again will they get anything from me.< /review>

<review>I spent 25 minutes in the drive thru , there was only 1 car in front of me and 2 people inside the food was cold and the manager was rude when I went in to speak to them about the mistake on my order on top of the wait .I usually like weinerschnitzel but I dont think I'll be going there for a while.<//review>< Time>

And I had order food and took it home to my family and ended up finding a dead spider on the bun of the chili dog that one of my children picked off and was horrified by it. I could not believe my eyes. I then went back and told them and the only thing they can say is sorry and give me one hot dog back. Unbelievable.

I ordered a chili dog with fries and a Resee's shake. The chili dog and fries were pretty good, although the chili dog pretty greasy. I didn't like the candy shake that much, and when I finished it I found most of the candy at the bottom.<//Review>

<text>I ordered a $10 combo with 3 corn dogs, 3 chili dogs, & 3 fries, and when I got home & checked my receipt, the combo wasn’t $10 as shown on their menu, it’s actually $15. I didn’t receive 3 corn dogs, instead, i received 3 additional chili dogs, & instead of received fries, I ended up receiving 3 chili cheese fries. They should update their prices on their food combos along with the food included. False advertisement!</text>< pictures>
