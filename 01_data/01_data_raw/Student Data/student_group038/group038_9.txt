I took my actual CPR on this school because the one I did online was somewhat not really acceptable for a health care worker. I watched the video online took the test, I passed 100 %, they emailed me to take the actual CPR. The instructor was very nice and respectful. It's awesome! He will teach you the right thing were to place your hand when doing compression, Adult and Infant.  You will be confident because you're doing the right thing. I recommend this school.< /text>

It was so easy to renew my BLS certificate with this company! It was very affordable, easy online instructions to complete the video/testing portion, and quick in person skills testing. I was in and out within 10 minutes.<//Text>

<Review>Needed my CPR Re-Certification quickly! There were a variety of scheduled classes to choose from, even weekends.  With Covid, you cannot do a full in person course. The virtual class, via Canvas, supplied by AHA was very good. The course was easy to follow, with lots of examples (SIMS and human). The exam was straight forward and hit on all the key points to doing CPR.  The hands on CPR was limited but since it was re-cert, it was enough of a review. The staff was helpful and took Covid safety and cleanliness seriously.   I got my CPR card and certificate emailed in 24 hours. It was a great experience and I will use them again.</Review>< pics>

Getting my AHA BLS certification at Critical Care Education in Fontana was a simple and fast process. The course is split into two parts, an online portion and an in-person skills portion. During registration, the date and time that you choose for the course is actually when you'll be required to show up and demonstrate your skills in person, so keep that in mind when registering.

Jonathan, my instructor, was very informative and helpful. He was patient with me and thorough in his explanations during the skills part of my course. I will definitely be renewing my BLS with Critical Care in the future.</Text>

Honestly I won’t be back. It took 2 days to receive my eCard which I lost 2 days of work. I’ve never had to wait 2 days to get my eCard, usually they are given at the end of the class. I’m giving 2 stars because the instructor was nice, but I definitely will not be back for a renewal.</Review>

I went here for my BLS certification and the place is easy to find and clean and professional. I signed up for the class two days before I took it, I’m so happy they were able to accommodate me on short notice. My instructor was Jonathan and he greeted me as soon as I came in the door and we started promptly. I learned everything i needed to know about CPR, took a short quiz, and was on my way. They emailed my card to me the next morning. I highly recommend this company. I wish everything in life was this easy!<//text>

I recommend this to anyone, either renewal or initial, that needs to take a BLS class or any other courses that are provided at Critical Care. My instructor was Melissa and she did a fantastic job leading the class, answering questions, and keep everything on track.</text>

In order to renew my CPR card, It was my first time taking a BLS course there. The staff there are very friendly and helpful whenever I have questions. Overall the class and the whole process is quick and simple that I greatly recommend coming back.<//Review>

I took the BLS course here. Instructors were very nice and made sure we were doing the actions correctly as we practiced with the dummies. The instructor also gave us a review before the exam. They want you to succeed. Great course!< /Text>

I am very satisfied with this class, I was able to get my BLS certificate in no time! The class was well taught, instructor Chuck was clear and very helpful. Mr.Chuck went above and beyond to make sure the class attendants were understanding everything before moving on. I give 5 stars because you don’t get this type of service just anywhere, I really recommend this place for anyone looking to get certified around the fontana area 🙂👍🏻<//text>

<review>Overall my experience here was great. I was able to get my renewal for my CPR/BLS at a great price and received my card same day! I would definitely return here for my renewal in two years. Aurora lead the class and was a great instructor. She emphasized the major points and had a great attitude throughout the entire class.  I recommend this class to anyone needed BLS training.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I renewed my BLS in the Fontana office 2 days ago. The location is easy to find and has lots of parking space. The office is clean and well lit. They offer free snacks. The employees are very nice and professional. I signed up for the class 3 hours before and was accomodated with no issues. I was practically a walk-in. Their price is very reasonable. I like that they have small groups per class which makes it finish quicker. I’ll be doing all my certifications with them from now on. I renewed my ACLS with them last year too.</review>< Pics>

<text>Went to Critical Care Education in Fontana for ACLS and BLS recertification. Easy to schedule and the price was reasonable compared to others. Nathaniel was my instructor and was very knowledgable and efficient in teaching the class. The front desk was very nice and personable and they offered complimentary coffee/water and cookies. Would definitely recommend to others and come back for future recertification.</text>< Pics>

You came in demanding that the class be shortened to one day while the other four students understood it was a two day course as listed on your confirmation and the website prior to you signing up.  You then asked for a refund when we informed you of the information you already knew and we provided an immediate refund for you.  You did not attend the class nor did you have any experience with Critical Care Education besides us not accommodating your demands to shorten a class listed as two days.  In our opinion your demeanor and attitude was very unprofessional for a healthcare professional.  Your horrible expierence was created by you not our organization.  We are happy to know you will not come back.  We do not want students like you distrupting our other students expierence with your attitude.\n\nCritical Care Education'}</resp><GmapID>0x80c34c939d47ac03:0xc80fd4f8b71126c<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I had a tooth emergency to arise and it escalated to requiring immediate attention.  I called Yosemite Dental Care at 7:15 A.M. PST and was greeted by a truly caring associate who expressed concern as well and she immediately scheduled me for an appointment at 12:30 P.M. PST the same day - ‘see you in 5 hours!’  From the moment I arrived I was treated with the utmost respect and professional care.  Dr. Allyson offered me the best care and attention I have ever experienced in a dental office, which is the standard for this facility.  Thanks to everyone there my issue was resolved.  Kudos to all!</text>< user_name>

I  went for a routine visit.  The staff is highly efficient.  My hygienist is Gina..  She has a beautiful demeanor and a soft touch. In addition to her superb job, she gives me tips on how to maintain my oral hygiene better.  I highly recommend Yosemite Dental for their caring treatment to each patient.< /Text>

Appointment was on time. I was a little bit caught off guard as they have changed procedures and iam not sure why.  Normally the hygienist cleans my teeth and then does the final polishing when she finishes the initial cleaning. This time they had another girl come in and take x-rays, my back molars only, not sure why and then did the final polishing first. This seems odd to me. There was no explanation as to why the new procedure. One of my complaints is that the girl doing the polishing and flossing did not floss UNDER MY BRIDGE and I did not feel like she knew how to floss my teeth properly. She just quickly slid the floss down the center space of each tooth instead of sliding it down the side of each tooth and under the gum line. This bothered me a lot. The other thing was that there was no record of my having a bridge! The hygienist said she fixed that in my file, she said that my file merely indicated I was missing those teeth. I've had this bridge for approximately 40+ years . Something is wrong here!! I HAVE TEETH UNDER THIS BRIDGE!! and have had REPEATED ROOT CANALS ON THESE TEETH UNDER MY BRIDGE!! They also did not do full mouth x-rays. They only did my back molars. WHY? I've had repeated root canals done on that bridge area. As I lost the teeth due to a horse back riding accident when my horse and I collided with a pick up truck and I went head first into the windshield. Iam disappointed this is not in my file anywhere after all these years. I find this not only disappointing but down right SCARY!!< /review>

My wife and I had appointments yesterday. Jamie did a great job cleaning our teeth but her assistant did not floss Debbie’s teeth. Debbie had her temperature and health questions asked but I had neither done.</Text>

<review>I have been receiving dental care at Yosemite Dental for about 5 years and I have always received excellent care. And the dentists and staff are wonderful, always interested in whatever the problem is and answer any questions you have. Another perk is they offer a dental care financial plan to help if you don't have dental insurance. I highly recommend this dental office to anyone.</review><gmap_id>0x8096b75c8670ac43:0xc09ceb4562f849f2</gmap_id></record>

<Review>It is always a pleasure to visit this office, the staff are kind, knowledgeable, and professional. The office itself is spotless, well appointed, comfortable and the artwork is fantastic. I was not surprised to see the efforts made to create a safe space regarding COVID 19 guidelines for their staff and patients. And while there, I experienced the joy of a fellow patient, who seemed to not be the least bit concerned for his procedures and was very excited to visit the toy chest! Just another testament to the professionalism of this staff. Thank you Dr. Weig, your team are the best!< /Review>< Pictures>

more os an assembly line then a dentist office, got in seated 10 min , dr/ dentist came in for 2 min , check out teeth, asked about concerns and went to next patient, after sitting there another 10-15 min hygienist finally came in and cleaned teeth. I get there buys but why have people sitting there for 20-25 min while you work on other people, Patients time is just as important as yours and why not work with patients schedules then just pack them in?</Text>

< Review>
Yosemite Dental care has been great for making sure our teeth are healthy and helping to keep bright smiles. We started going to Dr. Tom's caring clinic years ago. Jena keeps us informed with tips for cleaning our teeth more efficiently. Dr. Karen  was so helpful to guide us after some health issues and I was very please with a cap Dr. Tim replaced. During Covid this year they all helped us feel safe and comfortable our last visit.</Review>

<Review>I highly recommend Yosemite Dental Care in Mariposa! Seriously - I’ve moved to Yosemite Valley this past year and prior to this have had the same dentist since I was 14 (I’m almost 31 now) and knew it’d be hard to find a dentist that could live up to my expectations of efficiency and patient care. The folks at Yosemite Dental Care far surpassed my expectations! I feel at home here. Every member of the staff, from the moment I called to inquire about an appointment to the the moment I realized I left my lights on and killed my battery in their parking lot, treated me like a member of their family. (Huge shout out to the receptionist who I asked for jumper cables in the parking lot and Dr. Tim for taking time out of his busy day to jump our car! Seriously guys - this is the hospitality and humanity we all crave in this world!) But wait! - it gets better! I went in three days before my Dental ended, (I know I’m a mess) knowing that I’d need a deep cleaning and these people cared enough to go WAY ABOVE AND BEYOND to MAKE TIME for me. Jena was an amazing, wonderful, personable, hygienist who was gracious enough to fit me in on this busy day to ensure I was able to get the service I needed. She made me feel so at home and provided me with best most conscientious care to ensure I wasn’t in pain during the first portion of my deep cleaning. The staff worked hard to manage to fit me in the following day, super last minute, for the second portion of my deep cleaning, (which was seriously needed might I add) even though they were pretty booked. Sarah, the hygienist who took care of me on the following day was equally as wonderful and even told me about their family plan for folks without insurance to provide me with options after my dental expired. It’s safe to say that you want Yosemite Dental Care to be a part of your dental experience. The staff was also super conscientious of cleanliness and safety during this scary pandemic! If I could give more stars I would! Big thanks to all the staff at Yosemite Dental Care in Mariposa - I’ve never felt more cared for, safe, and welcome at a dentist’s office!< /Review>< pictures>

<date>1617822210354<//date><rating>5</rating><Review>I want to thank Dr. Tom Wieg and his Staff for giving me my life back. I actually had a Cardiac Arrest for 18 minutes and was in a coma for 4 days after my teeth were pulled when Western Dental in Merced, Ca. Dr. Guindi in Fresno, Ca. and Wisdom Teeth Away in Fresno, Ca. all told me I had some infection in my mouth and then removed all my teeth. I didn't find out until after my Cardiac Arrest for 18 minutes that there wasn't any infection. Thanks to Dr. Wieg and his staff at Yosemite Dental Care here in Mariposa, CA. I not only have my life back but I can now smile again!!! I just want everyone to know that Dr. Wieg really cares about his patients and I am proof of this!!! I would recommend Dr. Wieg to the World a million times over!!! Thank you Dr. Wieg for giving me my life back and for making me smile again, it's been a long time coming and I am truly thankful and Grateful to you and to your staff for treating me like a human being and not like a money maker!! God Bless you and your Staff!!! Love Always, Bobbie Joe Cavazos</Review>< pictures>

Took my 2 year old here for her first dentist appointment, the staff were incredibly patient and kind. From the moment we entered to checking out, everyone was friendly and accommodating to my toddler. The staff had concerns about her teeth but would not do the cavity screening for fear of scaring her. This resulted in me having to take her to a pediatric dentist, I wish they had just done the screening because it simply involved poking her teeth with the instrument. This visit was good overall.

Returned for a cleaning for myself, and had a completely different experience. The dentist was wonderful, I enjoyed my visit with her and she was thorough. The hygienist on the other hand was a terrible experience. She was very rough, scraping underneath my gums, causing a lot of bleeding, and ignoring my obvious pain. I was unable to floss for several days without pain after this appointment. I did not have any tooth concerns, cavities, and am diligent with my dental hygiene, this cleaning was unnecessarily painful, I had never had an experience like it. I wish I had the wherewithal to stop the cleaning and express my confusion, but I didn't. I had hoped the amount of blood and constant wincing was plenty, but I should have said something. I recommend the dentist, but encourage others to have caution with your hygienist and speak up if it is painful.<//Text>

Jan. '21: I go back to when "Yosemite Dental" was  Dr. Thomas Wieg up on the hill.  This practice is very professional and observant of today's safety protocols.  My experience today with Dr. Allyson Milman was great.  She is the first dentist other than Dr. Wieg who's worked on my teeth in many, many years.  Explains every step of the process and executes with precision.

Apr. '21: Went back today for cleaning with Jaime. Excellent!<//Review>

<review>Jaime is the best! She's thorough and gentle with her cleanings. Dr.Karen is wonderful! She goes above and beyond (during Covid closure and weeks after delivering her third bundle of joy, she went to the office for emergency x-rays for my son suffering tooth pain and discovered he needed a root canal.) A dedicated staff and very caring professionals!<//review><gmapID>0x8096b75c8670ac43:0xc09ceb4562f849f2</gmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

<review>Impeccable COVID protocol, extra effort in appt scheduling due to our distance from the office, and superior workmanship!

Dr. Allyson replaced a recent filling that failed (my fault), at no charge!

========================

I posted the above awhile back, and a subsequent visit reinforces my rating. Becoming a big fan of Dr. Allyson!</review>< GmapID>

Being new in town, and losing a crown, plus the stay-at-home order for COVID-19 made finding a dentist a bit daunting!  I called Yosemite Dental Care and got an emergency appointment. Dr. Tim was able to reseat my crown in the nick of time. Nice office and great caring staff. I look forward to being a real patient here soon!!< /text>

I was referred to these guys from a friend who works in Yosemite and I couldn't have been happier that she did. The staff here is super friendly and will work with you to meet any of your dental needs. I had an awesome conversation with the dentists there who were cleaning my teeth, which by the way, they did an amazingly thorough job at!

With all of this going for them, here's the kicker: all of your dental cleanings are free! That's right, you heard it, free.... even without insurance!

It is amazing to have a dental office in the United States that provides free cleanings without insurance, especially with how expensive health care in general is. These people are doing it right and I wish more offices around the states would follow suit.

I will definitely be coming back to this office,<//review>

I have heard wonderful things about Dr. Weig over the years that I have lived in Mariposa, although was continuing to see my former dentist near my previous home.  Finally, I took the plunge and went to see him with an emergency problem.  I immediately was able to see why everyone raves about him.  He is straight forward, calm and patient.  His technique was great too. In short I am pleased to be a new customer of Dr. Weig and appreciate his office staff who are equally professional.  Thank you</text>

<Review>What an amazing team and an amazing agent! Ilker did a terrific job at explaining my auto, home, and life insurance options and was incredibly patient with all of my questions. He couldn't have made it any more simple and easy to understand. I also met with Daniel , owner of Great Park Insurance, his staff are also very knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to any of my insurance needs.

Location is great and it has a parking lot with plenty of spaces which makes it easy for me when I want to just stop by to sort things out.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTFdXViv4xJ2Tn6-z5ZGLlxg5tm9hRIIrCkmHZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWOJZ5rRinaaw0IGMtbRIQr9tVU-5IFj3HI8pI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhgNFr7NlCvENdJlUv4vUanPxumGMoFTjGdx0z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>{'time': 1606943764278, 'text': "Thank you Baha for your visit yesterday.

He was able to fully explain everything about the coverage I was looking for. If I needed to make any changes, he was able to do so in a timely manner.

<Text>Victor from great park insurance made insurance shopping seamless and efficient. After inquiring with several brokers, they provided the best policies with more coverage for less cost. Insurance can be confusing, victor provided a detailed video explain what each coverage item means and it’s important. I will go to great park insurance for all my needs. I know my family, car, and home are safe in their hands.< /Text>< user_name>

I had the privilege of working with Julius Yang who was a top notch professional throughout the entire process. He was incredibly responsive to phone calls, emails, text messages and walked me through my many questions. I'd recommend him to all my family and friends. When you do your job well, you make the world a better place--Julius is doing just that!<//text>

<review>After 5 years working with Great Park, it is time to say goodbye. Way back when, I initially worked with Daniel, but my latest interaction was with Julius. Both were always incredibly transparent and honest, and worked with you on your needs.

Unfortunately, I am switching carriers to join my wife's preferred insurance. Thank you Great Park for 5 great years of great insurance coverage at great prices!< /review></record></dataset><record>
< text>
For the last 20 years I have insured my cars and properties through AAA. Every year I promise my wife to research the other insurance companies to ensure our rate is reasonable but every year I was busy with work and just paid AAA when the renew notices arrived.

This year I finally decided to do some research. I started looking at the Yelp looking for some local options and I came across “Great Park Insurance”.

Send a note to Mr. Julius Yang telling him what I am looking for and attached all my existing policies. Within couple of hours, he replied to my email and asked some questions.
Withing 2 days he provided me with both auto and home policies with exact same coverage as existing AAA policies but at a lower premium.

During the entire process, Mr. Yang was proven to be honest, friendly, knowledgeable, patient and answered all my questions. He explains each policy in detail and explain the available options.

I highly recommend Mr. Yang and Great Park Insurance.<//text>

<text>With regret: I am having to rate Daniel's review as 3 ⭐️ (probably the only one!). Daniel has been a great agent and his customer service record has been impeccable. I was probably amongst his first customers when his agency  was setup and have multiple policies from him currently (Auto, Home, Umbrella, Earthquake etc). However now that the firm is become large, he has other staff to service customers & it has turned into a less than ideal customer experience for me.
I have been trying to get information on my policy renewals last 2 weeks and have been tossed between 2 different reps and still did not get info. One of them was supposed to call me but never got the call! Ultimately I had to call/go online and figure this out myself.
Further I was a minor accident a few weeks back, sent an email to them and one of the did call me: but the call failed to show me empathy in a troubled time. Surprisingly, no call from Daniel (understand he might be busy though)

All in all, I am not seeing 'Daniel customer service experience' which is what I endorsed multiple times in many forums. I will probably stick with them another term and based on my renewal experience this month (still pending) might update my rating. So far the new staff at great park insurance have failed to meet my expectations: Sorry Daniel but haven't seen the high standard setup by you at 'great park insurance' have dipped!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I called to renew my home owner's insurance. Yesenia Marcha helped me out with processing my payment because I couldn't pay online for some reason. It took some extra effort to get it done and she went above and beyond my expectations. No snobby or arrogant attitude like your typical customer service representative. She was very helpful, responsive and professional. She is a great asset to the company. Great Parks Insurance, make sure her great service is recognized. I also request a copy of my review be added to her personnel file for future use on her next evaluation. Thanks Yesenia!<//Text>

<Review>I requested bids from 3 insurance companies, and Jordan from Great Park Insurance was able to get me a bid within an hour of my request. His price was about $150 les than the other bid that took 3 days to get, and I haven’t received anything from the 3rd.

I’ll always try Great Park Insurance first in the future.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><time>1620322266056</time><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1621633801982, 'text': 'Wow, this is great to hear Mark!

I was referred by a friend to Julius Yang. He is extremely helpful and prompt with all communications. Patiently and clearly explained all the different options and coverage. I was able to get better rate and more coverage than my previous provider. He is super friendly and emitted extreme positive vibes. 12/10 out of the gate experience and would recommend to a friend.</review>

I worked with Julius at great park insurance. Experience is absolutely wonderful. He responded to my requests in timely manner and got me a quote from nationwide. He revised them several times according to my needs and always available by phone or email when needed. At the end of purchase there was a issue with nationwide and he switched to progressive at an even cheaper rate with same coverages. Saved a lot of money and provided excellent service. Highly recommend this company for condo insurance coverage.</Review>

I completely understand why everyone rates Great Park Insurance with 5-Stars!! You get such GREAT customer service, detailed Loom video that explains your quote, and AMAZING rates! I'm the shopper that will spend hours online trying to find the best prices on everything I purchase. I had no idea that after contacting Julius at GP Insurance that he would do all the work for me and not only save me over $200 on my homeowner's insurance, but also provided really reasonable earthquake insurance policies, which I have never purchased before because I was always told by others it's too expensive and the deductibles are way too high, but that was not the case at all with GP Insurance! These guys are amazing and you will NOT be disappointed!< /Review>

<review>Really incredible service. I own a few properties and 2 cars and was looking to find home and auto insurance. I spoke to Julius Yang and he helped me tremendously through the process. I answered a few basic questions and Julius did the rest! The next day, he sent me an email with all my options and rates. He even sent me a video of himself going step by step through the different options, explaining what everything meant and giving his recommendations. Overall, it was an extremely smooth transaction. Insurance can get quite complicated and overwhelming but Julius made everything super easy and understandable. I ended up saving quite a bit of money to top it all off!

< Review>
Where do I start? From the moment I was in contact with Great Park insurance I've had nothing but upscale quality professional care.
Originally Daniel reached out to me with the information I needed to insure our new Big Bear property which I didn't know at the time of purchase! Apparently, I needed two separate policies due to fire danger and also because we will be using it as an Airbnb possibly. Almost immediately after speaking with Daniel I was in contact with Julius via email text and a call which I thought was amazing, because that shows that they are pretty much always accessible no matter which way that you need to get in touch with them and that's a plus for me.
Julius on is on top of it!!!! Julius all informed me of all of my different insurance options did the research and got me the best coverage at the lowest possible rates and I could not be happier. I want to mention that they have access to so many different companies which is amazing. Actually in the near future I am going to be getting a quote for our auto, current home and we would like an umbrella policy so we will definitely be customers for life as long as they continue to take great care of us. Just to let you know I called around a lot of different places and could barely get a call back and when I did they weren't able to handle the dual policies on the big bear cabin. So if your in need of a company that knows the law knows the rules this is your place look no further.

I want to say that my agent Jordan Meyer and John Ghasri made getting insurance simple and stress free . They’re easy going and most importantly reliable and honest . These days it's hard to find someone who is trying to give you the best quote that fits your needs but they nailed it . Down to the last part of starting the payment plan , there were options and ways to make it work and they gave me choices which I much appreciated.
Thank you and keep up the good job Jordan and John!< /Text>

My husband and I reached out to Daniel when we were looking for home insurance prior to purchasing our new house, and we could not be happier that we did! Daniel was extremely responsive and knowledgeable, and we ended up with great coverage for a very low premium. Daniel wasn't pushy at all, and he provided an extremely helpful video that explained our options. He also worked directly with our lender to make sure they had all the information they needed prior to closing, and the whole process was a breeze for my husband and me.

We'd absolutely recommend working with Great Park and Daniel in particular. They clearly place a very high priority on having great customer service, which is rare in the insurance industry.<//text>

<text>I contacted Julius at Great Park to assist me with getting a quote for some homeowners insurance under some very difficult circumstances. Not only was customer service first rate but follow through was absolutely driven by customer satisfaction, flexibility and a desire to help. As someone who has worked in customer service for my entire 22 year career, it's rare to see a company using all forms of communication--email, text, phone, etc.-- so efficiently to make sure I got as close to what I wanted as possible and covered as quickly and painlessly too. Julius allowed me to exhale in the knowledge that I was in good hands. Can't recommend him or the company highly enough.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcdce1050ff00b:0x88343c6ee530ba83</gmap_id>< user_id>

Our realtor raved about Daniel and referred us to him for home insurance. Daniel lived up to all the accolades! I was able to connect with him right away, and after completing a simple form, he had thorough quotes, and a PERSONALIZED video explaining the details of the policies in concise, simplified terms. He was readily available to answer our follow up questions, and we ended up with a policy that was ideal for us. Honestly, we were astonished by the customer service. Daniel took care of everything for us. The process was absolutely seamless! We highly recommend Great Park Insurance, and Daniel, in particular.</Text>

I’m very thankful to have been referred to Julius at Great Park Insurance!  From the moment that I reached out and every time thereafter, his response time was fast and his level of service exceeded my expectations. Julius is 100% friendly, kind, and professional.  He was thorough and patient with my questions. I never felt pressured or rushed to get started.
After our previous agent of 15+ years retired, I didn’t find out until I wanted to add my daughter to the policy.  At that point I felt the rates were inflated and I needed a change.  With Julius’s help, my family now has more coverage and I’m saving over $1000 per year!<//text>

Moved from Connecticut a month ago and my agent referred Great Park. Daniel did his homework to insure our home and auto, but we were trying to find a cheaper deal.

So glad I found Great Park Insurance. I'm in the process of refinance my house. My current insurance agent took too long to respond to lender inquiry on my house insurance. I also needed to renew my house insurance and wanted to combine house/auto insurance. Reached out to my current agent and they didn't even bother to look for cheaper solutions for me. So, I started my research and looked for new insurance company. Found Great Park Insurance via yelp. Sent in a quick inquiry on their website. Got a call from Daniel within 5 minutes later. He sent me email asking for further information and then the next day provide me with quotes of auto/home insurance combine. He created a video explain clearly my options and how much I would save. Overalls, I save about $300 changing to new insurance company. Daniel is very responsive via email, phone, and text. After I signed on. He helped provide information to my lenders to spread up the refinance process. Thanks Daniel for your assistance.<//review>

<text>Although Great Park Insurance wasn't able to find me a better quote than what I already have, their customer service and response time is excellent. Daniel, the owner of the company, reached out to me himself and made it feel like I was a valued customer. If you're shopping around for any kind of insurance, it's worth it to give Great Park Insurance a chance for them to shop around for you. They'll let you know if they can help you out or not. They even offered to follow up with me next year to see if they can find me a better rate. That's A+ for customer service.< /text>< Pics>

Julius Yang at Great Park Insurance is the best. I had called multiple insurance companies directly but I was told they could not help me and those that did provide me quote took such a long time to take my information. I spoke with Julius and he knew exactly what our company needed, he came back to me with quote very quickly and it far less expensive than what I was getting on my own. He was very responsive and professional. Use Great Park Insurance they truly can get you great coverage at lower prices.</Text>

< Review>
Working with Great Park Insurance was such a pleasant experience. We are first time home-buyers and we worked with Julius Yang. He was incredible! He made the intricacies of selecting various insurance policies (auto, home, earthquake, etc.) efficient and easy to understand! After selecting the best deals for us, he put together a video presentation explaining all of our options in a very straight forward manner. He was also remarkably quick to respond to any and all questions we had. I highly recommend Great Park Insurance and Julius Yang for anyone looking to work with an insurance agency.<//Review>

I found these guys on Yelp and then a group on Facebook also recommended them. I submitted an inquiry. Almost immediately I get a text to greet me and explain the process.

I submitted the forms and the next day, I connected with someone live and went through my scenario.

I was EXTREMELY difficult in my request and these guys handled it with perfection. They gave me so many options to choose from and made me feel I was making an informed decision.

Not once did Daniel try to sway or one way or another. He just provided data and facts to help me make a decision that is best for me. He didn't make feel I was difficult, even though I knew I was!

We came to a decision within days and everything was situated so quickly. Easy and painless. Highly recommend these guys for your insurance needs.<//Text>

Daniel at Great Park Insurance is amazing. We are closing escrow on our first home, and due to recent fires in the area, every other company (including one I've had an auto policy with for 20 years) wouldn't work with us, which was threatening to delay our close of escrow. We reached out to Daniel late last night, and we got a quick response, with a personalized video explaining our options very clearly. By 9:30 this morning, we had our new policy chosen and finalized with escrow. Daniel is a lifesaver and I can't recommend this company enough!< /Review>

Remarkable customer service. Daniel answered me immediately and thoroughly explained all the questions I had about auto insurance.

I found Great Park Insurance through Dave Ramsey ELP to see if my auto and/or renter's insurance cost could be reduced, and I highly recommend!

Julius made everything super easy and found better insurance products for me! Slightly cheaper auto insurance, but with way more coverage, AND way cheaper renter's insurance.

Thanks, Julius!<//review>

Daniel was the most patient and professional insurance agent I have ever dealt with. The video greeting he put together was to the point and addressed everything I wanted to work on him with. If you are looking for a new Auto or Home owner insurance policy, or looking to reduce the cost on your current policy, reach out to him. You'll be glad you did.</Text>

I came to Great Park Insurance as my neighbors referred me - and it's been a top-notch experience. I worked with Daniel, who is lightning-speed responsive at all hours of the day, very knowledgeable, and best of all, an excellent communicator (he gets you by text, email, and/or phone), and listens well.

The system is super efficient - Great Park uses lots of technology, online forms, videos to explain my coverage options, text reminders.... everything you didn't even know you wanted! I also like that he's a broker so I know he's got my best interest in mind. I was really impressed that he had several options to present me within hours of my original email to him. Daniel is super detail-oriented and not only price-conscious, but wants to make sure you're well-covered with what you're paying -- you can't find a better combo.

The team shops your insurance renewal every year so you get the best price with the right level of coverage. I'm saving about $185/year on my home & auto just by exploring my options, and I'm glad I did. Highly recommend!<//Review>

We have been with Great Park Insurance for over a year now. They helped us get renters and auto policies when we moved to California from Colorado. Noemi has been especially helpful: she has answered many questions, gotten us quotes in advance when adding our teen driver, helped us navigate the automatic monthly payment system, and shopped for the best rates at our desired coverage amounts. We’re very happy with Great Park Insurance services.</review>

Navigating your coverage options alone can be daunting. Daniel and the folks at Great Park Insurance guided me through every option, broke them down with an easy-to-understand screen capture video (my personal favorite part of the experience), and ultimately succeeded in finding the best deal for me. There need to be more businesses like this in the world. Seriously, Daniel is awesome. Never once, did I feel like I wasn't his top priority.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I would like to take the opportunity to thank Mr. Julius Yang of Great Park Insurance for his excellent help in finding insurance for me.

During a refi, my homeowner's insurance carrier (Traveler's) canceled my insurance due to fire hazard in my area.  Obviously, one cannot refi without insurance, so my mortgage broker referred me to Mr. Yang.

To say I worked with Mr. Yang is a misnomer; I did absolutely no work, Mr. Yang simply took care of it for me.  And he saved me money by bundling my car insurance and my homeowner's insurance.

Thank you Mr. Yang.< /Review>< pictures>

I’m always blown away by the service I receive from great park insurance. I recently inquired to see if my current rates were competitive in addition to obtaining some new insurance quotes for my rental property. Noemi was very professional and took the time to answer my questions.  During my interactions, I never felt there was a rush to just answer my question and move on.  Rather Noemi listened to by needs and then within a few days followed up and provided the information I needed.  If you have any insurance needs and want A+ service, be sure to work with Noemi; she will take care of you!< /Text>

Great Park has been a fantastic insurance partner.  They are always very fast and friendly and get me the best coverage at the best rates.  I typically work with Noemi and she is on top of her game and makes sure that everything is taken care of in a very quick manner.  I highly recommend Great Park Insurance</Review>

<gmap_id>0x80dcdce1050ff00b:0x88343c6ee530ba83<//gmap_id><review>I got the reference to Great Park Insurance from my refinance agent, and the overall the quote and purchase experience was excellent and impressive. I was talking to Julius on the Friday before thanksgiving, the goal was to get a lower premium home insurance compared what I currently had, their quote and policy came back very quick with detail breakdown, as well as matching my home policy with a better DWELLING coverage. I replied one hour later in the afternoon and Julius had an medical emergency left before noon, still, he got my back the next Monday and helped me settle the policy. one thing worth to mention, they're agent on top of big insurance companies, e.g. for my case, my new policy is with Nationwide that comes with a great deal. (and I'm calling them again to get a quote on the auto policy)

(11/30/2020) updated on the auto insurance, the policy coverage is the same and the price is slightly lower, however, the combined discount with the homeowner is better so that I go with this new auto policy. (tho my original auto insurance, GEICO, was trying to counter me with a 15% discount lol)< /review><UserId.>100293069490896181026<//UserId.><Response>{'time': 1606269622356, 'text': 'Thank you for being so understanding Stephen!

Thanks to Dave Ramsey, I was connected with Daniel at Great Park Insurance! Together, we discussed Dave's baby steps and we were able to discuss my comprehensive plan, not just my insurance plans. Daniel made sure I didn't spend one more day uninsured. He helped me until nearly 9pm on a Friday night to make sure I was informed, comfortable and safe with my insurance policy. THANK YOU DANIEL!< /review>

My friend recommended me to Julius Yang and I was mesmerized by his professionalism and quick service! Even though it took me some time to gather the information he requested, Julius was very responsive and at the end of the day it was totally worth it. He made the whole experience very enjoyable. The premium wasn’t much of a difference, it was actually a little bit more than what I was paying now, but I made the switch knowing that I wouldn’t be able to receive this type of service elsewhere. Keep up the great work Great Park!</Text>

I worked with Noemi to get Auto and Home insurance. She gave me one of the best coverage for way lower premium after comparing with many insurance companies. She understood my requirements very quickly and gave me many options to select from. She was very responsive and prompt to accommodate my different requests and questions. I highly recommend to use Noemi and Great Park Insurance services for your insurance needs.<//review>

This review is long over due. I’ve been with Julius for a couple years now and he is truly one of a kind! He was there when I got my first car and really walked me through the whole insurance aspect of it. I didn’t know anything and asked so many questions, but he was so patient, professional and understanding! He was always accessible and never made me feel like a burden! He is so detailed and willing to go the extra mile to help me. I would highly recommend Julius Yang and Great Park Insurance!<//text>

< review>
Great Park Insurance is a great agency that goes beyond what you would expect.  In particular, my wife and I worked with Earnest in going over our insurance needs.  We have 10 different insurance policies including auto, home, rental, umbrella etc.  In our meeting with Earnest he carefully studied each one and then asked questions to make sure he understood our circumstances and whether the coverage on each one was what we needed.
Within a day he was calling with quotes on several of the policies and a couple of days later had quotes on all.  I was extremely impressed by how thorough and timely Earnest was.  I would strongly recommend Earnest and Great Park Insurance for anyone that is looking for an agency with high integrity and customer service excellence.< /review>

<review>ERNEST RODRIGUEZ is the best! I had an urgent need to find home owner's insurance and he was so responsive and easy to work with. He found a carrier for me in less than 24 hours and also presented a proposal for cheaper car insurance. I appreciated the ease of electronic signatures as well. He was proactive at looking at my re-fi closing date to ensure that my premium wouldn't go up and offered another solution to make sure I would save money. Thanks Ernest, I appreciate you!!< /review>< pics>

<Review>I’ve had the pleasure of using GPI for 8 years now. They are very easy to reach and very personalized. You always get to talk to an agent as opposed to a machine. Ask for Noemi, she was super responsive and she worked with me to find a solution for my very particular inssurance needs.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

My husband and I were in a time crunch on closing an escrow on a new home and we needed insurance immediately. We called Great Park Insurance and spoke to Ernest and he was not only friendly but went above and beyond the call of duty to get us our quotes on both home and auto and get our policy done so that we could close escrow as planned. I would most definitely recommend Great Park Insurance to anyone who wants not only great personalized care. Awesome Job Ernest.</review>

<Review>Ernest Rodriguez did an excellent job in helping me to get my business insurance! My agent for renting the new warehouse was not sure about the specific terms in the general liability policy. As I asked for, he immediately gave my agent a call and explained everything clearly. He was very patient with me since this is the first time I buy business insurance. I have lots of questions and answered with no confusion. He is also an efficient guy who got my policy very fast as I need it to have the keys for the warehouse. I would definitely recommend working with him! Thank you, Ernest.<//Review>< pictures>

Julius is awesome!! I had to create a yelp just to post a review about how amazing he is. He literally was there every step of the way.

I was about to purchase my first car but knew absolutely nothing about insurance. I am sure I bothered the heck out of him, but no matter what time of the day he would respond to every single one of my questions. He made sure I understood all of my coverages. Julius definitely went above and beyond. Thank you for making this process and enjoyable experience for me!< /review>

<review>I contacted Great Park Insurance for an auto/renters quote. Daniel immediately assisted me with my inquiry, it was by far the smoothest process I’ve ever experienced while obtaining quotes. He gathered the information he needed, did his research and actually found that I’m currently receiving pretty low rates. He was friendly, efficient and honest... he didn’t attempt to offer me lower rates with less coverage just to gain a client! Which completely earned my trust and respect! I may not have switched over, but as my insurance needs change, I know who I will contact!<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1566249878539, 'text': 'Thank you Chelsea....we definitely try to make the process easy and hassle free.

A friend referred me to Julius and Great Park Insurance. I was in the process of moving back to Orange County and needed to find affordable auto insurance. Julius made it super easy for me. He was very communicative throughout the whole process and quick to respond to all my emails. He was able to clearly answer all my questions. Julius went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. I am glad that I found an agent I can go to for all my insurance needs.< /Text>

Ernest Rodriguez was extremely efficient and helpful in addressing my corporate business insurance needs. As a new business, I had many questions I needed answered and Ernest made the process of binding our policy as painless and easy as possible for me.

His professional and friendly manner made the process even more delightful. Thanks Ernest, I will be recommending you to anyone with insurance needs.<//Review>

<Review>Daniel is absolutely amazing. You can tell when someone loves their job because there's so much excitement and joy put into helping others. Daniel is that guy.

Daniel has been extremely helpful during my search for General Liability, Excess, and Auto. He is responsive, reliable, honest and friendly. What more could I ask for?

Definitely recommend!< /Review>< pics>

I was assisting a client of mine with a purchase of a new home.  I told my client we needed to start working on Ins and if they had someone they use for ins.  They told me they have been using Daniel at Great Park Ins and gave me his contact info. Since Ins would be needed on their new home we needed to get the process started ASAP.   I reached out to Daniel and he responded right away and got escrow and I everything we needed immediately.   Daniel was absolutely fantastic to work with and helped be part of us closing early for our clients.  On a purchase transaction the Ins is usually the last item needed and more often than not causes delays with the closing but with Daniel this did not happen.  I was so impressed that any new client I get I send them to Daniel and he has continued to impress.</text>

<review>They’re the best insurance agency in the OC. Prompt response. No hassle, No BS, the solid quote (accurately lowest possible quote based on what you ask. no trick, not trying to just lower number by omitting essential coverage.) Always easy to communicate. These sound like basics but only few do it properly. This is one of the best few.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1566584172688, 'text': "Thank you Sangjoon for your wonderful feedback.

As much as I love my kids, when my oldest started to drive, I needed to add her to my insurance and to my shock, the premiums went up 3 times!!! After my shock wore off, I wanted to see if I can do better (I was with Mercury). I called GPI and was connected to Ernest and he was great!!! He answered all my questions, was extremely prompt and offered many alternatives to my current carrier at a lower cost. My final package came in at 25% lower than my previous premiums and at higher coverage amounts!!! So thankful for the work Ernest did and would highly recommend Ernest and GPI to my friends and family.< /text>

<text>Julius, Daniel and Ilker will help save you money and time searching for trustworthy and reputable companies for nearly every situation you can think of. I was relieved to be able to find such a professional and accommodating team of agents after leaving my former Insurance Broker. I asked plenty of questions and was provided thorough and patient service. I look forward to working with these guys for years to come.</text>< Name>

<review>Just signed up at Great Park with Julius and everything went super smooth. My last insurance company kept dropping the ball and I finally had given up. It's great to see other companies out there truly perfecting their craft. I look forward to the continued relationship with Julius and Great Park Insurance! Thanks again Adam< /review>< pictures>

<text>I wish I had known about Great Park Insurance from the start-the pride they take in the work they do and the thoroughness, speed and professionalism with which they do their work is just different. Everyone I interacted with in this office was friendly, but more than that I think that you can sense a genuine kind-heartedness and goodness from the team here. My auto insurance coverage is great now and for a better package deal than what I could have obtained through my visits to different offices and through online quotes on various sites. I worked with Julius Yang, and he was so thoughtful and patient throughout the process of helping me get auto insurance. He helped me see every discount I could qualify for and would pause and make sure I understood everything about my insurance and the different options I had. He was so knowledgeable and efficient, but also helped me feel very comfortable asking questions and voicing my concerns and preferences.</text><rate>5<//rate><Response>{'time': 1569453780818, 'text': "Thank you Grace for trusting Julius and GPI to assist!

He was so sincere, genuine and honest. He was very professional and thorough in providing me with options. He took the time to explain each coverage and option with me. Julius is the man!

After reading all the yelp reviews I decided to give them a call. Even though I decided to stay with my current carrier, I can’t say enough great things about Julius. I really appreciated his honesty, professionalism, and detailed explanations of my coverages. He really wanted what was best for me and advised me on what made the most sense. The service I received from Julius and the Great Park exceeded my expectation. It’s hard to find a trustworthy agency, but I am glad to have found them. I’ll be back at my next renewal and for any insurance needs that come up.< /Text>

Almost gave up, luckily found one more name from Web, Great Park Insurance, their reviews is very extraordinarily. So, I called them and talked with their operator. She said the office closed regarding covid 19 but everyone worked from home. She would let consultant know. Only couple mins later, Julious called me back and spent sometime to understand what I need. The question he asked me I knew right away he is very professional and helped me to finish everything very fast. No wonder why their company review is very good!!!< /review>< Pictures>

Learned about Daniel and Great Park Insurance through an online search, and decided to reach out to Daniel for a quote. I'm impressed by the quickness of Daniel's response and the comprehensive and detailed coverage options he offered. He highlighted all the differences between my current policy and the options he was offering for easy comparison. He also spent extra time and went into great details with me to help me understand various coverage items.

Daniel is the best!  He's been helping me out with insurance since we bought our house in 2013.  In that time, I have bought/sold at least 5 cars, and he has responded with updates to our policy/rate within hours, if not minutes.  This is even on Sundays!  He's always gotten me the best rates for home, condo and auto insurance.</Review>

I honestly feel so blessed to have found Daniel to handle all of our insurance needs! We have been using another broker for many years now, who has been giving us the best rates, BUT Daniel got us even better savings and greater coverage!!!! He was so easy to work with, making the process a breeze. And I could see how hard he works because he would reply to my emails even if I emailed him at 5:30am or at 8pm!!! He is honest, and never made me feel pressure about anything. Highly highly recommend him for anyone who's looking for an easy-going, hard-working, honest, clear, and best rate/coverage broker! We used him for auto, home, condo, and life! Thank you so much Daniel!< /Review>

Although I did not end up switching insurance providers Daniel was very honest and prompt with his emails. He recommended I was better of staying with my current provider. I will definitely come back to him for any other insurance needs I may have in the future.< /review>

Was shopping around for commercial liability insurance when I ran across Great Park Insurance .  I was helped by Julius which was able to provide me a quote with what I needed quickly and had my certificate in place before the others even called me back. Julius was very professional and answered All of my questions. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

Daniel runs an awesome company that provides superior service! He is very responsive and provided quotes with multiple options to choose from. I insured my cars, two homes and umbrella through him. He researched multiple carriers and was to beat my current insurance rates overall saving me money. He's been a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend him!< /Text>

From the moment I walked in the door at Great Park insurance I felt appreciated.  I was greeted with my name on a welcome sign with my appointment time-wow 5* service!  Daniel was personable and thorough which is important you can easily tell that relationships are valued at this agency.  It was a pleasure to meet with Daniel and learn more about him and his agency, being in the same industry it’s nice to know others whom I can trust to take care of my clients when they are needing something I cannot provide.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Daniel and his team at Great Park are second to none! He is great to work with and I have been very happy with both my quote and the level of responsiveness. Daniel helped with our homeowners insurance policy almost 6 years ago but he was so responsiveness even years later. Earlier this year, we had a leak due to the rains here in Socal. I thought of contacting Daniel before hiring a contractor. I sent Daniel an email and he got back to me immediately. We got on a quick call and he laid out what he recommended. It ended up saving several hundred $$ for us to get a professional quote on the issue instead of us having to pay for it. I would recommend them to everyone!</Text>< Pics>

I was in the market so I set up some time to speak with him and, after a short conversation, he provided me with options for great rates and coverage so I decided to give him my business.

Now, many years, several cars and a couple of houses later, I'm still a very happy client.  Daniel ALWAYS responds immediately when I email or text him and has literally never failed to, not only fulfill requests, but to does so quickly, efficiently and happily.

I recommend Daniel whole-heartedly, without qualification.  If you need insurance and you want customer service that is beyond reproach, call him.<//Text>< user_id>

Daniel Seong is an absolutely amazing, customer-focused agent.  If you're looking for great rates and great service, you won't be disappointed.  I've known him on both a personal and business level for 8 years and he's a very solid dude.  He also makes some pretty mean coffee, if you get to his office.<//Review>

<text>Damn, Daniel!! Haha jk!

I looooove working with Daniel! He is honestly the most reliable and quickest to work with.  I have been working with him through 3 vehicles now, about 6+ years, and every time I’ve had a great experience.

What I like the most about him is how quick he is to respond to messages, and how quick he is to get the ball rolling and get things done.

He makes the process so easy! I’ll definitely be working with him as long as he stays in business.   He is most definitely my go to guy!

Thanks Daniel< /text>< Time>

Good group of guys and their lift bay is awesome. I got a 3.5 inch metalcloak True dual lift and they did a great job. Jeep handles great. Easy to find a place to do lifts, but it's hard to find a good one. Do yourself the favor and go here.<//text>

<text>I met Gaspar who happened to be the owner about a years or more ago. I didn’t know at the time he was the owner but I asked some questions and he was really helpful and gave me some good advice. As busy as this shop was especially Gaspar he still helped me out. This shop is capable of working on anything but Jeeps are their main cup of tea. I at the time had a Toyota FJ Cruiser I was working on and felt that i was better off looking for a shop who only specialized in FJ’s because resources for parts were few and not readily available.

Recently I purchased a 2014 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and the first place I went to was Brothers 4x4. I’ve been to every shop under the sun, but I liked the helped Gaspar gave me & his knowledge about Jeeps.

They are currently working on my vehicle, adding a lift, wheels, re gearing and everything under the sun possible to my vehicle. I have built other projects and what I’m getting, I know the cost of parts etcetera and really feel I was steered in the right direction with excellent prices. I was really taken care of and I can’t wait to get my vehicle back. I am sure I will be happy.  I will post another review with pictures soon once my vehicle is complete. My FJ is shown here with my Jeep in the back ground. But I definitely give Brothers 4x4 a five star review. Everyone there, is extremely knowable and helpful.<//text>< pics>

Service writer was straight forward which I appreciated a lot. And Gaspar gave me a fair quote. Had them do suspension work on my truck and I'm more than happy with the results. They do good work and they did it quick. Tech did more than what I asked for, Thanks guys!<//text>

Gasper and his team are awesome people, By far the best prices and the quality of work is solid. Gasper is not here to up sale you on parts you do not need, but will go over what your goal is and what you want to do with your vehicle and he will help you accomplish that. This will forever be my shop.</text>

This is a professional shop. My husband brought his Jeep for beadlock rims and got a great value and service from Gaspar the owner. I highly recommend this shop. Clean shop, honest service and good reasonable prices.< /review>

Unsure about this place.......you decide. I had them change a driveshaft center bearing. After changing the bearing, it revealed a secondary problem I was unaware of, that left my truck with an incredibly hard vibration that started instantly after repairing the bearing. I tried to explain it to the owner and he wrote me up an estimate to change tires (they only had 20k miles on them and cost $1,600 for 4), shocks, idle arms, and other suspension and steering items that have nothing to do with this vibration that started over night after changing a drive shaft bearing. So while they changed the bearing and it's fine, they totally misdiagnosed and provided in my opinion, a lazy and inflated diagnostic estimate, sorry.<//text>

I came here with my buddy who has been a previous customer. He's loved everything they have done for his rig. I didn't plan on buying anything as we had just left another 4x4 location and made prior purchases. I saw a few items that interested me but were unavailable at other locations so I inquired about them. Brothers hands down gave me the best price quote compared to others needing to order the items. They are very knowledgeable in the industry and treat customers how they should. Needless to say, I will be returning to complete my purchases and continue to do business with Gaspar and Brothers 4x4.</text>

I have a 2014 rubicon with a 3.5 rubicon lift and 37” tires I called and got an amazing price on tires and alignment so I brought my Jeep in when dropping it off I asked if they could also help me find a few loud sqeeks I could not find it was an embarrassing noise I grease all my fittings and still loud sqeeks. They knocked out my tires and alignment quick and when I pick up my Jeep they took the time to show me that my rear upper control arm lock nuts have been installed wrong wearing out the threads and making the loud noise. I can say this place has earned my business in the future my tires and alignment are perfect and I did order the arms and install them myself and my Jeep is quiet and perfect again. I can’t say enough about this shop the manager is great and super helpful I hope you bring your jeep here they saved me money headache and did a great job thank you<//review>< pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>These guys kept my jeep for 35 days to instal a fan clutch, radiator hose and some control arms.
$2300 later and 35 days later. (4 hours of labor and 3-5 shipping for parts MAX)

Gaspar returns my jeep with an empty gas tank, a brand new engine I just installed and this guy is "test driving" my vehicle and storing it in the 100F garage with an empty gas tank.
My jeep couldn't even make it to a gas station, 2 miles away. Stops running (which takes over 60 miles of driving even after the tank is on empty)
Then a P0204, P0206 (fuel injection malfunction) shows up with the check engine light.

When I called the owner very upset about my jeep being mistreated and having problems, he told me
"That is how you left it with me"

I needed repairs and this clown cost me more damage, kept my jeep for 35 DAYS!!! When I contacted them and was upset he cussed me out on the phone and suggested it was my fault.

STAY AWAY FROM THESE DUMMIES!!
They are terrible at communication, they take forever and they will abuse your vehicle.

If you care about your jeep or truck, STAY AWAY!!!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>Dont do it.. for the love of god dont come here.
1. Worst customer service ever
Rude angry guys
2. Liars..
3.  Mistakes happen but when they do
You wont get an apology
4   If their dead youll save a few bucks
But with that you wait a week and end up paying more
Dont do it.   If you do
have fun waiting, have fun paying more and getting ripped off.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Brothers 4x4 has saved my vacation twice. I needed my rear end rebuilt as I got water in the diff. Didn't realize my problem until I was preparing to go to Moab. Call them and explained my problem and that I was leaving for Utah the next morning. They jumped right on it and by the next morning I was on my way to Moab for a week of wheeling. I highly recommend them for all your 4x4 service.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< review>
Helps water all the farm land around from the mountains.
Not real crazy about the canals since I missed my turn, and lost my car😭. "Thank God I didn't lose my life!"
Don't eat the fish out of the canal either🚫, go to the river, and fish instead!🐟Just a friendly warning🚫</review>

<review>Just got off the phone with Mark at V&H customer care line. I am happy to share that Vance and Hines thoroughly stands by their products. After 20,000 miles on my 2015 CVO Street Glide the rear header pipe formed a crack at a weld for the rear mount and literally over time from expanding and contracting broke almost clean. After sharing the pictures and giving Mark my info, with in just a couple hours he had an approval to send me a new rear header pipe and slip on clamp free of charge. I even offered to pay for it or at least pay for the shipping cost, but Mark said they would just take care of it no problem. Thanks for the exceptional customer service Mark and V&H! You have me at Hello!!! Great Job!

Cheyne, provided excellent customer service. I have the fuel pack on my bike and just installed cruise control enabled handle bar controls but needed to flash the bike.  I was able to upload my map and have it sent back next day with CC enabled. Flashed my bike and works great now. Thanks Cheyne!</Review>

I have had numerous vance and hines products, intakes exhaust and tuners.  I ALWAYS recommend this company to everyone for its excellent products and support for them. I have always been impressed by there customer service but recently I had some damage done to my bike that required me to order some replacement parts. Cheyne McNab helped me out on both my my calls. He went above and beyond with makings a bad situation good. He was able to get all the parts I needed ordered and shipped with in the same day.  Motorcycle companies need to emulate employees like cheyne and vance and hines.  Thank you Cheyne McNab<//Text>

< review>
I have a 2007 FXSTC, We all have our reasons  but my bike means a lot to me. It's got a stage one kit, specifically Rush pipes (1.75) HD high flow air and a FP3.
I started with a decel pop, spoke with the folks at Vance & Hines (VH) and they helped me figure out where I screwed up. so, fixed. Couple years go by and I start to have a really bizarre idle problem, I'm chasing a ghost here, all the blogs read exactly as my experience is but no one has an answer. (long winded sorry)
I reach out to VH and get help from C.M. (I hope VH knows who this is as he deserves recognition)..now..my FP3 is out of warranty but the help I get never questions that, this guy just wants to help, he tells me things about the FP3 I wasn't aware of. I'm uploading my maps, he's making adjustments, I'm downloading and remapping, I'm sending feedback and this guy is getting back to me quickly and making more adjustments, this goes on for awhile with some success but ultimately I ended up taking it to the dealership,  This is where it gets really good, The dealership says a lot of times its a tuner problem but once they see the exchanges between me and this guy at VH? the maps, the adjustments, tuner is ruled out immediately and they are like whoa?  No excuses allowed here, we need to figure this out and its not the tuner.
Its because of the help I received that the tuner was not an easy excuse
Its because of the help I received that the dealership had a direction to go when diagnosing the issue
Its because of the help I received that I'm writing this long winded Thank You to C.M. and the folks at VH for standing behind their product and helping their customers. Now I feel bad for not buying VH after market pipes! (i like my rush pipes though) I also like the service department at my dealership, the mechanic is great, their service advisor is great so I have no complaint there, but the VH customer service is a rare find today, I appreciate it, I will champion it for VH and I will recommend VH to anyone. I appreciate the help and say thanks...That's my experience</review>

I had a great experience with Vance and Hines. I have a 2015 Dyna Street Bob with their staggered Big Shots and the FP3 tuner. Amazing products. One of my heat shields failed on me about 2 years after install, and fell off. Cheyne McNab was awesome with their support and sent me a replacement the same day. Thank you guys!< /Review>

Staying indoors, I decided to install FP3 into my bike after a high flow air cleaner install coupled with a pair of slip on mufflers.
I was extremely frustrated with the new tech!  That’s before I engaged Vance and Hines, via email, chat and phone call.  To my surprise, they contacted me back on all three!
Cheyne (I think pronounced Shane) walked me through step by step and boom... more Horse Power!
Thank you so much for following through and taking the time!
5 out of 5, keep these two on your team and get them to train others to perform with this kind of high quality!

The WORST company that i deal with!!!!! Waiting for my order more than 6 month and still did not get it! I placed an order February 2016 and still for 6 month they did not send my part , they said it will be shipped overnight , but still nothing for 6 month. Every time when im trying to call to customer support and talk to supervisor or  manager , every time they having lunch or running to the car. BE AWARE OF THIS SCAM COMPANY!!!!!! Main manager always traveling and never call back after i left voice mail.</review>

<Text>Great product customer support. I purchased the fp3 fuelpak for my 2010 softail deluxe and had changed out the stock air cleaner to the v02 drak by Vance and hines. Also changed out my exhaust to bassani road rage 2to1. I got in touch with vance and hines via their website during normal operating business hours when there live chat option was available. I let them know my setup and they gave me instructions on what to do. Well I was at work at the time and was unable to do so. Cheyne with vance and hines carried the conversation from live chat to my email where I was able to do the changes to my bike during the weekend. Im really happy with the results and things couldn't have gone smoother than it did by the way this was all done on my smartphone samsung galaxy s6 edge from live website chat to the email and of course flashing, uploading, and downloading the maps thanks again :)< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Ross was professional and beyond helpful (he even called local mechanics to see who fix our vehicle on a Saturday). He let my interested 8 year help him and was able to transport our family of 4 to our hotel. So appreciated!

I broke down due to transmission problems just as I entered Arizona going east on I-40. I called A Toe Truck and was picked up within an hour, which considering the remoteness of my location is really good. The driver was courteous and professional. Payments can be made either by cash or card, and of course insurance is accepted. The driver recommended an outstanding auto repair shop and I was on my way in two days. Highly recommend!< /text>

This company horrible this the second time I had to use them thru aaa. The first time they wanted me to pay 400 to tow my truck and trailer home want to put it on a landoll trailer instead of a flatbed tow truck so they would make us pay instead of AAA towing it and going through AAA. This time they put my truck on a flatbed but was going to charge me originally $360 to tow a tow dolly behind it $12 a mile who wants the driver got there and see what I was telling they worked it out as like dollars flat fee for the tow of the trailer</text>

<Text>Excellent customer service and they dont try to rip you off with a certain minimum hours to squish your pockets just for being in a semi tractor trailer. Loren was very professional and very comprehensive to work out with prices and excellent service. Very recommended for any towing services.< /Text><username>Road Runner</username><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80ce23719cd50e51:0x9b825fa73817d8e8</gmap_id>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><review>They are the best. Their main concern is for the customer. I broke down West of Needles .Ca.  on friday Aug 31 and called for a tow.  Jason showed up in a short time and discovered his rig wasn't big enough to carry my truck/ camper. He let my mother in law sit in his air conditioned truck while the bigger rig was on its way and insisted on staying and helping Ross, the second driver, with loading my truck up. Ross took great care in delivering us to a repair shop that they recomended, and everything worked out to the good.</review>< pics>

Hi! I had Claudia and Carlos and both of them were /phenomenal/!!!! I'm absolutely coming back to get repairs from you guys. They get the job done the way its SUPPOSED to be done. No cutting corners here! The guys on your team totally color matched my bumper and everything! (Way better than the original dealership). I love the job they did!! Thanks for the awesome experience!< /text>

<review>I brought my car here after I was hit by someone who ran a red light. Wonderful staff and service! They sent me updates about my car nearly every day, and it was even ready for pickup ahead of schedule. My car looks great and I can’t tell that there was any damage! I would also like to thank Robert for delivering my car to me at work!<//review><Resp>{'time': 1618322846140, 'text': 'Hi Catherine Rossello.

<Review>lady who took my estimate was trying to make things worse off then they were as caliber collisions  were the third opinion of the day and the lady kept insisting that I had put the car back together wrong and it was just a weird experience. Go to sunshine auto body much more professional personable and knowledgeable.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Professional and friendly service. There were some ups and downs with the repair process on my vehicle but ultimately I ended up being a satisfied customer. Caliber cares for their customers and if you’re in the waiting room they will offer drinks as well as special popcorn ;).

<Review>First fix after accident was faster then expected, however they ended up calling to let me know there was a recall on parts they had used, they'd come get the car fix and return it, approx.3-4 hours to make this right.  They closed shop, never called me, never brought back the car, so I guess I am now taking a third day off work to get this fixed since no one answered when I called.  Guess they are keeping the car overnight???<//Review>< Resp>

I am beyond happy with the quality of work done on my vehicle.  This place was great, I was able to pick up and drop off my rental from the shop.  Workmanship is impeccable.  Customer service was great.  My advisor Noe explained everything to me and kept me updated and outperformed his promises and my expectations.  Would definitely recommend Caliber.< /Review>

None of their notes say the cars side sensor  was off and we called them after we picked up the car right away to let them know this . I will never use the caliber company again life time warranty is bull.<//Text>< rating>

<Text>Jueves, 25 de Marzo 2021:
Casi siete años pasado, Mi hija dañó el parachoques trasero de mi auto en mi Mercedes. Ella choco contra un pole. Yo Busqué en otras tiendas de reparación, pero Yo decidí por Calibre en Hesperia. Carlos Vargas was the best ever.  Too bad, Carlos transferred.

A few weeks ago in March, a man hit my four months old Nissan Sentra also in the rear bumper, but much worse than the small dent that my daughter did on My Mercedes Benz.  This time, I was taken care of Robert Pate. He was the repair advisor. Robert was good.

The office staff Cristian, Claudia and cutie pie, Julie all Spanish speaking Latinas and that is a big plus because Spanish is the second largest spoken language in North America.  All of them were great.  There was only one minor setback.  A technician forgot to replace my car decal on the bumper, but Claudia took care of it.  I highly recommend the location of Caliber Collision.</Text>< pics>

Punctuality, Quality
Thank you to caliber Collision center for turning a very stressful time in my life into a very pleasant experience . Claudia the manager was great she assured me that I was in good hands and not to worry. Also julie the receptionist made the whole vechicle check-in process extremely smooth and had enterprise there to pick me up within 15 minutes also when my vehicle was ready she explained to me all about my warranty. Karen was the estimator who was keeping me well informed every step of the way with phone calls and text messages . My car came out like new I am 100% satisfied with all the work done & the paint matched perfectly.  I would also like to thank the body men who worked on my car . Caliber Collision's team is great thank you all !!  P.s..I really liked the fact that you can drop your rental off  with Caliber when your vehicle is ready for pick-up.< /review>

< Review>
I was finally able to get with the right person. I was getting my damages repair at the bear valley location at first. I had many complications at the bear valley location appearing more scratches inside and outside  in my brad new car and dents. Believe me bumper was popping  out and they place silicon glue on my bumper I had to go back many times and still job was not getting done. I had to actually complaint to my insurance about how careless they were.

Until they Referred me to this location. I can say I’m the most happiest person of how well the job was done. Theirs no other words I can explain of how grateful I am with the whole team making sure my car got the repairs it needed. Also Claudia that I had the pleasure to work with, was ensuring everything was  well done and making sure I was well satisfied.

I’m not a person that gives reviews. This is the right location to get you car Repair.</Review>

had an excellent experience from the time I showed up and was greeted to the time I picked up my car.  Specifically, Luis was thorough,  and explained the issues of my repair so that I could make an informed decision. He never pushed nor "sold" me...
Furthermore, he called to update me on the status of my car.
Upon completion my car was clean and you could not tell that anything had ever happened... I was very please by the service, quality and price.

Brought my car to them for repairs.  When it was time to pick up my car I came across a new dent on the car next to were the original damages were.  I told them that they created this dent and need to fix it.  They seemed hesitant to repair but realized that it was their mistake.  I can't believe no one manned up to there mistake that they made the dent.  They were ready to give me my car back to me with new damages. Not a honest company.  They did fix it and drove the car to my house.</review>

Excellent service, communication, and value. My beautiful purple baby was hit while parked, and the staff communicated with me on an almost daily basis about the progress towards restoring her beauty. I needed to have some upkeep done on the paint because my baby is parked in the sprinklers at work on occasion, and they color-sanded and returned her better than I brought her in, for half of what I was told just a few months prior by a different Caliber Collision office. Don't go anywhere else, you'll be satisfied. And if not, they're a national chain and will make it right no matter what. Love them!</text>

My car was taken to Caliber Collision after it was hit on the freeway. Ashley and Sam were very kind, attentive, and thorough. Sam did an outstanding job of keeping me up-to-date on needed repairs and was able to get my car done ahead of schedule. He took care of everything like I imagine he’d do for his own family. It’s apparent that they hold themselves to a high standard and take pride in what they do. I’m very grateful!<//text>

I have had to take my car in to Caliber Collision three times within the last year unfortunately. But I will say they make an unpleasant experience very pleasant. All the staff is amazing and go above and beyond to take care of your needs. I have never had to bring my car back after they fixed it and they always do an amazing job. Karen and Ashley do everything they can to make you feel at home. Their customer service is excellent and I would recommend them as a first-choice to anyone!<//review>

Not happy with the lack of communication with the receptionist and not happy with the quality of some alignment repairs. Had to call corporate to straighten out money issues with this particular establishment.<//Review>

<Text>My rear bumper was damaged due to a accident on Friday. I took it in on Monday and showed Karen Raia the damages and on Thursday my bumper was repaired. Sam Llamas did an amazing job and I was very satisfied with the repair and even better when picked up my suv it was clean and shiny! I will defiantly return to Caliber Collision for future repairs!

<Time>1438894794788< /Time><Text>I had a Mercedes that was involved in an accident. So, I called my dealer where I bought the car figuring that if anybody new a good body repair body shop for a Mercedes - they had to know. They recommended Caliber Collision in Hesperia. The results of the repair were just unreal - there was no way of telling where the damages were and it actually looked better than new. Their service was impeccable, and if there was one thing that was a con is that it took longer than they expected and if I were you, I would allow for the double the time they estimate. I am now taking another car there today (Hyundai) and will follow up as to how they do from the last job they did for me.</Text>< Gmap_id>

I have brought many a car here, from a 1996 ford thunderbird, 300m, 2006 maxima with $13000 in damage, to my 2013 kia optima. They have always treated me like gold, they are the greatest crew!! thought my maxima would end up a car with squeaks and groans, but honestly it was as solid after the accident as before, held on to it for 6 years, I will never take any of my cars anywhere else....<//Text>

<text>I had my window broken into, glass everywhere. I was told by my insurance company not to touch anything until they were able to get an estimate done. I made an appointment with Caliber Collision for 8:30am the next day. When I arrived, they had no record of my appointment. They still got me in, and I waited about 10 minutes. The estimator and I went out to my car to take pictures and look, and she told me, "Oh did you want to drop it off today? You'll need to get all this glass cleaned out first...Well...maybe our guys can do it." It's a collision center. Fixing the mess is part of the job, I would imagine. So she looked at my car, took her pictures, and got everything in order. I dropped my car off on Tuesday morning first thing, and have been told my car will be ready by today (Friday). I haven't heard anything on when I can come get it, and they'll be closing in a few hours. I haven't seen what my car looks like yet, but their service has not been all that great. Although I could also be cranky that some jerks broke my window and week ago and stole my lunch box and caused all the mess in the first place.<//text>< user>

After four years had a Horrible experience when i pulled it out of ther shop it was perfect after  spending $5000 on a custom paint job  and 5 months ago I noised something wasn't right that they didn't even use primer under the paint and it's now peeling off down to the mental they just buffed it and painted over the original paint   Worst auto body shop in the high desert  They will rip you off don't go to the  on Highway 18 in Apple Valley Californian its  a scam.<//Text>

<review>The worst experience at  Arco first of all none of the employees have nametags and are working under fake names on top of that the manager seems to never be available upon request the work ethic that these associate  have is beyond unprofessional I have been trying to apply for over two months to this place whenever I go in there is always a reason I can’t speak to management which in customer service we all know should never be an issue. I could only imagine  The type of store this so-called manager Rudy is running<//review></record>

Been here a few times, the prices are good. But I have had issues with the card readers not working on some pumps. Also the pumps are super slow. So if you are in a rush I don't recommend this place. But if you like cheap gas it might be worth it.<//text>

<review>I was unloading at Sysco across the street and stopped into Papa Dukes just before closing. I grabbed 2 Mushroom Swiss burgers and brought them back to my truck to have for dinner. All I can say is wow, these are great sandwiches.. Lots of mushrooms and the beef was seasoned perfectly... I'll definitely come back to try our more items off the menu.. Cheers!<//review>< pics>

Papa DUKE, papa Naight here. I have to tell you that this was by far the best morning breakfast I have had. Duke was getting the store ready and I kind of snuck in with my son without being open yet. We had a competition down the street early. Papa Duke was the nicest man and I would love to boost him up. Great selection, the food was delicious and he made us feel extremely welcome. If I lived there, this would be my main spot. See you next year Duke!<//review>

<Text>Papa Duke's is a great place to go for high quality meals. Duke is always extremely friendly and very helpful when it comes to choosing the right meal for yourself. If you're ever in the mood for some boar's head and a relaxing meal, Papa Duke's is the place to be!< /Text>< gmapID>

<Date>1598214083288< /Date><text>First time here, always looking for a good sandwich, this place is the real deal!  I had the Brooklyn Hero with a side of Fresh Cut Fries, everything was delicious!  The bread is awesome, much better than the "buns" all the other sandwich shops seem to use, this was real french bread with a nice crust and good "chew"...  We'll definitely be back (even though it is a 25 mile drive each way!).  The owner is super nice and definitely does things the right way!  They are now open on Sunday's and they have outdoor seating.<//text>< Rating>

<rate>5<//rate><review>My wife and I were in Poway looking for a simple meal for dinner and found this place on Yelp. I highly recommend coming to this place. We ordered the Meatball Parmesean sub and the Nick's Viva Chicken sandwich and they were amazing. The portion size was huge and you could instantly tell every single ingredient was top quality and fresh. I can't wait to come back to this place! The owner ("Papa Duke") himself served us and was extremely friendly. He checked up on us to make sure our order was great and could not have been more helpful. If you are looking for a super high quality sandwich or sub, make sure to come to this place!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1599903822847, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words'}</response><gmap_id>0x80dbfbba216ff11b:0x6e7fc803d9f75275<//gmap_id></record>

Good service. The sandwiches (Ruben and a tuna melt) were both delicious. Not exactly photogenic but it made my taste buds and stomach very happy. So much flavor for a tuna melt.<//review>

Although they mostly serve the business community in the area,  it is well worth a little extra drive to try the place.  I recommend the Reuben sandwich or the Mediterranean salad ( loaded with olives,  chicken,  ...).
Nice family.  Small place.  Great food.  We need to support small businesses like this.</Text>< Pictures>

It was a pleasure talking with the owner, he takes great pride in providing great service and food. I absolutely love this place. The meatball was superb and I would be happy with anything off their menu.
5 stars 🌟 highly recommended!< /Review>

Papa Duke's is my go-to place whenever I want a sandwich. Ron, the guy who runs the place, makes many of his own sauces, including Au jus, as well as his own meatballs... and he does not skimp on portions... the rest of the meat comes from Boar's Head, which is a very high quality meat that is natural without anything injected into it or added to it. And he uses fresh bread baked daily from a special source. All in all, if you like sandwiches, I would very highly recommend you come here. You will not be disappointed<//Text>

I found this place by accident, and I am immensely glad I did. The sandwiches are top-notch stuffed with the freshest meats from Boar's Head company, and plenty of the meat and cheese and other ingredients. The bread is fantastic too and has the right texture for sandwiches. They don't skimp here, and their personalized service is fantastic. The fries are absolutely amazing as well, hand-cut and homemade. I am not easily impressed by restaurants, but in this case I was impressed. I am definitely a won-over repeat customer. Thank you!</text>

<text>Great place, ingredients are fresh, bread perfectly toasty, good amount of meat, these guys don't skimp and you get your money's worth! I used to come here to pick up a Jersey Shore for breakfast on the way to work occasionally, but now I usually eat at home. If I miss breakfast at home one day though for some reason, there's a good chance I will call in here though to pick up a tasty Jersey Shore.<//text></record>

Excellent sandwiches with quality ingredients. They use Boar's Head meats, in addition to homemade things such as their meatballs and pulled pork. The meatball sub and Cuban panini were outstanding. Good atmosphere with a nice little patio, and Ron, the owner, was friendly and passionate about his food.   We'll definitely be back, since I'm looking forward to trying other things on their menu!</Review>

Really good sandwich shop.  Can definitely tell they care.  Great bread and great ingredients.  So far I have had the Reuben and meatball sub and both were great.<//Review>

We work in the same business park as this deli and the fact that they deliver is excellent! We normally order buffalo chicken wraps from them and they are delicious! I have tried a few other things on their menu as well and it always comes out good. We love this place and continue to eat here on a weekly basis :)<//review>

<text>Great tasting food, hearty portions, clean neat location and friendly service. They serve a good variety of hot and cold sandwhiches, burgers, paninis, salads and changing tasty specials. Food is made with quality ingredients and boars head meats. It has become my go to lunch spot when I am in the area. The parking can be limited especially during busy hours.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

OMG!!! CAN'T BELIEVE I've lived down the street from this Place, and didn't know it existed! Old school East Coast, Boar's Head meats, kinda place!! The omasora rolls are there as well. Save yourself the hassle of flying to the east coast for a sandwich and stop into this place!!</review>

Food:
* The meats and cheeses are all Boar's Head, so it's good quality.
* Good variety of items on their menu (wraps, sandwiches, burgers, much more), and the prices are good.
* They run daily specials and have an email listing you can sign up for.
* Beverages: several coolers of sodas, energy drinks, teas, sports drinks, etc. There's fountain drinks too.

Service:
* Always great and out quick.
* I go here a lot and have never had any complaints.
* Delivery available for places nearby.

Misc / Notes:
* Indoor & outdoor seating.
* Good atmosphere, it has that mom & pop feel.
* Great lunch spot for employees on the industrial parkway, and worth the drive from Poway Road if you're coming from that direction.
* It's easy to pass up. Right across the street from Sysco and next door to the Body For Life.</Review>

<text>Great service, great 'wiches. Their Italian hero is a winner, packed with a generous heaping of cold cuts. If you substitute the default bread with ciabatta, and the Italian dressing with their unique "peppercorn gourmaise", the sandwich strikes a stirring resemblance to the now discontinued italian combo from Panera. Loved that sandwich. This one's just as awesome.</text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

<text>I went through the drive through.  The line moves at an okay pace.  There was a misunderstanding with my order but Cashier Jojo fixed it and was above and beyond.  I truly appreciate awesome customer service.  The food was really good!!! It's a must try!< /text>< Pictures>

Warning!!! Don't order by phone because they will still make you wait in line to pay for your food. By then everything is cold. The reason people order by phone is to avoid the long lines.  Especially when you only have a 30 minute lunch. Worst part is a manager come out to argue and not take your money. Never coming here again! I'd pay more to else where!</review>

I make simple request, like no onions or no avocado and they ALWAYS mess up at least 1 item in my order or completely forget to give me one or more items from my order. My record wait was a few minutes shy of an hour. There's usually a wait of 30 minutes, even if they're empty.<//Text>< GmapID>

< Review>
Only been here one time. Got a fish taco flavors were good tortilla is store-bought not handmade. Which is a bit of a shame. The only reason this is three stars instead of four stars is that my fish was a little soggy. Fried fish should be crispy and this one was kind of soggy. Go with better tortillas and get the fish nice and crispy and hot and five stars<//Review>

We like to go for the weekday specials (different every day).  My favorite is the $1 fish taco Tuesdays.  This Alhambra location on Valley is small, but does have small dining areas both inside and outside.<//Review>

I used to say it was 5stars but now on fish taco tues their $1.00 fish tacos are not as great as they once did. I know orders come in and it's always busy but they don't fix em like they used too. The crema is barely put on the taco and the fish is soft not crunchy like it used to be< /review>

This place has gone done in customer service,  seems like they hire managers with zero customer service skills. I used to go there every week on Tuesdays and order up to 100 tacos every time for work and I would kindly ask for everything on the side so they wouldn't get soggy, it was never a problem but the new manager is willing to loose customers by being rude and not wanting to satisfy customers needs.<//Text>

Stinchy on condiments like chili etc. Precovid it was not a problem as it was selfservice. Now they will only give you two packs of 2 chilli's .I bought 15 plus fish tacos for  5 people with only 4 chili's. 😒</Review>

The fish was nice but the Baja has too much topping and sauce that overwhelm the whole taco. Everything could have been season a little better. Can't speak for anything else here but prob will go elsewhere for tacos.

Wait for food was about 45 min.  Seems like they were prioritizing the drive thru. I ordered inside. The food was cold when i got it and honestly it wasn't all that good. Maybe $1 fish taco day is a better deal. At that price can't really complain for what you get.</text>

< Review>
I went to this location on Tuesday with my boyfriend to try out the food since it seemed like a really good place to eat Mexican food at. We were completely wrong. We ordered online, there was a 35 minute wait for our food, which we did not mind. When the 35 minutes came by, I went into the store. I was not greeted by anyone so I went up to the girl who seems to be helping people with online orders. I told her that I was there to pick up food and gave her my name. She just kept looking at me and then stared at my phone. I asked her if she needed the email for confirmation and with attitude she said yes. She then wrote down my name and told me to wait outside. I waiting for 10 minutes after the 35 minutes I was required to wait. I went inside and since she was not around, I waited for her to come back. Before talking to her, the client she was talking to said he had been waiting for an hour already. I asked her "how much longer until I receive my order" and she just stared at me and nodded and walked away. Meanwhile she went to help another client to look for his order, he mentioned that he was waiting for an hour and 30 minutes which seems ridiculous for the fact that it was a pick up order and people in the drive thru and walking into the store were getting their orders faster. When I got my order, the quesadilla I ordered was no even cooked throughly. The cheese was not melted at all and was still chunky, also full of grease. I also ordered the tacitos and the plate was a mess. It did not even seem like an effort was made to put it together. We also ordered a surf and turf bowl which was missing the carne asada. The ceviche was leaking which made the tostadas soggy. This was one of my worse customer experiences at your location and they should properly  train their employees because our money is paying their bills.<//Review>

< Review>
The food is exactly what you would expect from a simi chain eatery.  I have been three times and the food is somewhat inconsistent.  Otherwise average.< /Review>

<gmapID>0x80c2c5118c200607:0x13bdafa822b1f768< /gmapID><Text>Reason I gave it 3 stars was because i did not like the cashier service... She was a bit rude, my husband does not speak Spanish and she would shut him in spanish telling him to wait because she was typing an order in.. I tried to tell her he did not speak spanish and she rudely told me the same thing again.. I do speak spanish. So maybe have a bilingual person who can address both language peaking cashier and they took long. But other than that food and drinks was on point. Only 1 handicap parking but can fit 2 cars side by side with  enough space. Handicap access all around too and also a drive through. Great spot will be going back again.</Text>< user_name>

I rarely write reviews but this experience took the cake. I phoned in. The person taking orders was rude but I figured they were probably stressed. I made this call around 12:35. I was told to park and walk-in and it would be around 20-25 minutes. I was in no rush so I went in at 1. I paid at the front and was told to wait outside. I want to preface this next part with im pretty patient, probably to a fault. The people who walked in and ordered all got their food before me. All of the phone orders are taken to one of the front tables and you can see when they bring them out. I was a little frustrated at this point as I waited 45 minutes only for walk-in orders to be ahead of me. I went back inside to look at the finished orders as I had seen others do before. The cashier was extremely rude and told me to get out. I saw my name but I still exited as I didn't want to cause even more of a commotion. I waited another 15 minutes for the runner to come back to the front. She finally came out and I asked her about my order and she said oh its been here, she grabbed it for me and I left. It was about an hour and five minutes from phone order to getting my food. I hate to write this review because otherwise their food is amazing. It is the management here that seems horrendous and disorganized.</text>

Delicious, has drive through that could accommodate bigger vehicles which is nice because I have a truck. Menu has a lot of options to choose from. They have deals also. Got the fish tacos which were a little soggy today but usually they're fried better. On the corner so you can see it easily. Has indoor and outdoor seating and salsas that you can get to add to the flavor. Give it a shot it's legit.<//Review>

This location is a JOKE! 0/10 stars, do not recommend!
Their staff is lacking major phone etiquette, which is imperative for take out orders.
Today, after waiting ten minutes on hold to place a phone order, they told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes.
I came in exactly at the 15 minute mark (I work next door so I make sure to take my lunch break once the food is ready.
My order was not ready. They asked me to wait outside (covid, I get it). Twenty minutes goes by and my food STILL isn't ready (I only get a 30 minute lunch break).
They don't apologize, nor offer anything to make it right. They just refund my money.
Then I look at the receipt they gave me, they charged me for someone else's order! I'd been waiting for food that wasn't even mine!
Mario was the one helping (if you could call it help) me. He was rude throughout the whole experience and didn't care that I had waited. Not once did he apologize. He did not read the order back to me when I originally paid, he just took my name and charged me.
After I realized that I was waiting for someone else's order I called the store to let them know. The manager (Jaime) listened to the whole situation. He never apologized. He told his employee that he needs to read the order back upon paying. The only thing he offered to make the situation right was to give me my meal for free. But my break already ended. I told him if I could have the free meal the next day that would be okay. He stated that it was a free meal right then and there or nothing at all.
Seriously? What a joke! And, to note, their food is decent at best.

0/10 stars. Do not recommend.<//Text>

<Review>I got the weekday special of two fish tacos, small fries and a drink and added a shrimp taco. The fish tacos are ok. The shrimp taco was definitely better. The prices are good 3 tacos, fries and a drink for under $10. It does have very limited seating inside and out. You can park in the parking structure behind Edward's Theater.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>We had lunch here. We ordered fish and garlic fries. The crispy batter surrounding the fish was very good. The garlic fries has chopped chunks of garlic which was very tasty. It is a truck and not an actual restaurant. Seats were out door under umbrellas. Small area to sit and eat.<//Text>< Pics>

Yes the place has a taco Tuesday sale, but it’s very bad organized!!! Drive thru clients get there food way faster than walk in customers!! Waiting for over 15 min not one person has been called from the walk in but drive thru at least 6 cars have left... very bad organized it should take turns not all drive thru orders come out first!! Over 30 minute wait.. phone orders done and  sitting on the table waiting for clients to pick up!!< /review>

Agua fresca is thee best as well.  Gotta try it.  Drive thru wait is 100% worth it.  Listen to some good music in the car while u wait, food will be amazing.</Review>< pictures>

<review>The food is to wait for, no matter how long the  wait is. We had the shrimp tacos, they don't disappoint.  Chile relleno burrito was perfect not to spicy and flavorful.  The Mar y Tierra burrito was epic. This place will have your tastebuds asking for more.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><user_id>109135416019458928153<//user_id>< Time>

<Text>Tasty tacos in an unexpected place! I came to have tacos and meet with a friend. Not expecting much since I had never heard of this place, I was totally taken aback at how tasty their tacos were!

Parking seems limited but there is street parking available around. The area seems relatively safe, and there seems to be other businesses sharing the same parking lot.

The location is nice on a corner but seems to get a lot of traffic and so the outside and inside seating area is so-so clean, but the fish tacos make this place worth the visit. We were craving fish tacos so I ordered their baja Cali taco combo (comes with 2 🌮 with shrimp & fish) and it was fantastic. We ordered the ceviche which was quite generous but I did not try it though it looked tasty. I also ordered their fries which were 👍 and I enjoyed this place thoroughly! Highly recommended!<//Text>< Pics>

<UserId.>112254315412340932384</UserId.><Text>Each time I place an advanced telephone order or order in person, there is always a long wait. Whether they are busy or not, average waiting period is a minimum of 20 minutes.

Keep in mind that all their proteins - whether it would be fish, carne asada, al pastor, or lengua are cooked in advance. All the cooks need to do is assemble these proteins for tacos, burritos, fries, etc.

So why the slow speed??? Both Alhambra locations are extremely slow despite my numerous complaints to the managers.

If you don't mind the lengthy wait or chaos at the restaurant, then Baja Cali is your place!</Text></record></dataset><record>

I just had one of the worse experiences at this Baja Cali. I have been going to this place for more than a year with no complaints and loved the workers and the place. Tonight changed all that, I'm not sure what was up this lady's you know what but she was not friendly. I order 2 vegan Asada burritos in the drive thru. She stated  our order to us for 2 vegan Asada burritos and gave us the order. When we got home the order was wrong it was two tacos. So I went back to the place to try and get the burritos, no problem humans make mistakes and I wasn't going to create a problem. Instead I was met at the register with attitude, this lady said I repeated the order and said Asada tacos, with a really annoyed tone. Even though me and everyone in our car heard her say burritos. I then repeated to her, but that's not the order,  the receipt says the right order and you still proceeded to give us the wrong order. She just stared at me like it was my fault and never said anything. Why am I paying 30 dollars for this just to become furious at a worker who clearly can't keep her emotions in check? I walked out of there didnt say anything. I have been living in Alhambra for 2 years and have been frequenting this place with no problem. Baja Cali just lost my business for good. The food and the service was cold and dry. Since the cashier wants to give me attitude instead of admitting her fault, I will be taking my business elsewhere, you just lost a loyal customer. I don't need attitude when a guy is just tryna eat.<//Text>

Lots of people come for taco Tuesday but there's other specials throughout the week.  They got really good fish tacos as well as other types of tacos and burritos and quesadillas.  Been here at least half a dozen times already and has always been really tasty!</Review>

<review>My only concern about this location is the lack of attention to what a person is ordering. 5/10 times my order is incorrect and when they are corrected they get the "attitude" that they are bothered. That's why I only go when the manager is there, because the staff they have when she isn't there is very lazy in their customer service.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Food is good, service is lacking. They also put chili in everything so if you don't want spicy chili, let them know. My kid couldn't eat. When you try to call they disconnect the phone. It goes straight to voicemail & voicemail isn't set up.
I like their food but I do think twice before I order again.</Text><user>116059639650860219750< /user>< gmap_id>

<Review>Drive-thru was very horrible experience we asked for two different containers to put the two different orders in and they weren't and we ask for no red salsa in the tacos and the driver asked to four different containers and extra chili in she wanted pay for it they said no and then the other girl cashier said no she can't they also got a order wrong and I paid a lot of money for my order I think I need a refund and also they put salsa red salsa and the order in one order and I think they did that on purpose because they did not like the driver at all this was drive-thru but there was two girls that were very rude and shouldn't be working there at all I need my money back!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I came here on Tuesday at lunch and it was a bit of a line. Took about 15 min to get my items. The place has small but had a cool red and yellow theme going. The design and layout were modern and inviting. They have promotion from Monday thru Thursday every week! Tuesday is $1 fish tacos and Weds is $2 shrimp tacos. I ordered 2 fish tacos. They were piping hot and tasted awesome! The fish were cripsy with delicious topping sauce. The side stand had red onion, lime, and orange bell pepper. The tables had a good selection of hot sauce so you can keep every bite spicy! Will have to come back to try out more from the menu!<//review>

Really good fish tacos for the price! Rice and beans were OK, but I'd use the money for another taco instead.<//review>

<Text>I AM A BIG FAN OF BAJA CALI ON MAIN STREET ALHAMBRA BUT THIS LOCATION IS CLOSER TO ME, I WENT ON A FRIDAY MORNING AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED, THE FOOD WAS GOOD BUT WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST CUSTOMERS AND THE LADY WAS ON A BAD MOOD. THE TABLES STILL HAD STAINS OF FOOD FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY AND THERE WERE NO NAPKINS. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION.</Text><Date>1599141070805< /Date>< Name>

<text>Searching for fish and chips for my grandfather! Was able to find this place. Ordered food online, which was really convenient. Stopped by the restaurant to pick up along the way for our family visit. The food was super fresh, especially the fish tacos and the fish and chips. I didn't realize the fish tacos were a standard spicy. If I knew that beforehand, I would have been able to change the order for the kids.<//text><UserId.>112140286306176142667</UserId.><GmapID>0x80c2c5118c200607:0x13bdafa822b1f768< /GmapID>< Name>

<Text>The fish tacos are great. The barbacoa tacos are the best! There are about 4 decent parking spots in the back & 1 handicapped spot in the front. The street parking gets tough in the afternoon & on Taco Tuesday, it's worse. The menu has soup, ceviché, burritos... everything you want! Be prepared to wait because this place is popular. Indoor & outdoor patio seating available. I'm so glad this place is here!< /Text>< Date>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>I'm giving two stars because the food is actually very good.  That said, I'm done with this place because the service is so bad.

If you order ahead and they say 20 minutes, it doesn't matter when you show up.  They won't make your food until there are no other customers(maybe) or until after you arrive and pay(for sure).  They pretend your order is in, but it isn't at all.  After you pay, your order rolls out like everyone else's order.  They should stop pretending and stop faking phone orders!

They've also made errors on several orders of mine.  You call and they blame the cooks.  Sure if you drive all the way back they may attempt some sort of resolution, but the rate at which they make errors is super high.  They make excuses that they can't check every order... It's not my job to put a reliable process in place... I'm the customer and I like getting what I order, especially when it's a To-go order.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Super inefficient. 3 people in front of me takes 15+ minutes but why?? It makes no sense that they could be so slow, especially if you look at the reviews.

I'm convinced they offer free food if you leave a 5 star review. Don't fall for it</review>

The food is really good so far. Ive tried almost everything on the menu. Tacos (every protein), nachos/fries, burritos. The bad and I mean really bad, is the long line. Drive-through and walk up. Even if you called in your order 30 mins ahead, you'd still have to wait an additional 30 mins to receive your order.  The wait is worth it but I hate waiting so long for whats considered to be fast food. Compared to Chick-fil-A and In-n-Out, this place takes the cake on the longest line.<//Text>

What a tasty meal. Had the mixed seafood soup. To die for. Had morsels of fish, shrimp crab, octopus, albacore, scallops and clam. Delicious. Highly recommend. Small place with little parking, but worth parking down the street.< /review>

< Review>
Great Mexican seafood, high end restaurant flavor at a good price. Fish tacos here, you cant go wrong. They're delicious. I haven't tried there soups, but ive seen others eat it, and it looks so good. I even tried there non sea food foods, like carnitas burrito, nachos, tacos, and they all taste great!!!
So rare to find a place where all the foods taste good. Only down side is its small, recommend eating on the outside patio.</Review>

Been in here a few times and have been happy with the quality of the food. Fresh and good tasting for fast food. Vegan options are great for those in the family who are not carnivores but want to enjoy meals together. Seafood was good. Small dining area indoors with a larger outdoor area. My only issue was the need for table and chair cleanliness in the outdoor patio. Definitely coming back when that taco craving hits. Fair prices and they have a kids menu.<//Review>

This place is freaking great. The tacos are just excellent. Not much to it. Simple menu, great food. Great folks running the place. Pricing is good and fair. Parking on the other hand is a bit wonky. Not much of an issue, but it's a hassle when having to park with traffic waiting behind you on either the major street, or the neighborhood street. But don't let that discourage you from taking the time to enjoy some great food.</Text>

Giving 1 star for poor customer service and satisfaction. I placed my order before anyone else showed up but ended up waiting 20 minutes before getting my food while everyone after me got theirs. When I asked why it took so long I was told they lost my order..not cool 👎<//Review>

This restaurant has amazing fish tacos! They taste authentic and are priced fairly. On tuesdays they are sold for only 99 cents a taco! The lines can get really long, especially around lunch and dinner time so if you plan on going on a Tuesday, arrive early or be prepared to wait. They are so delicious however that it’s definitely worth it!</text>

Mar y Tierra (shrimp and carne asada) burrito is the best around.  I get it without beans and is just the right amount of food.  Easily my go to Mexican restaurant in the area.  Prefer this location over the Alhambra Renaissance location.  Feel the food is better.< /Text>

<Review>I've tried the aguachiles tostada, fish tacos, carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, potatoe tacos, shrimp cocktail, asada sope, chicken sope, horchata, and cucumber water. I love the fish tacos the best. Their meat isn't lean, so if you don't like eating fat, you'll have to pick it out of your food like I do. If you like spicy foods try the aguachiles and get that cucumber water with mint and chia seeds. It's the most refreshing drink! A good meatless option are the potatoe tacos, they're delicious.
If you go on a Tuesday, the line goes all the way outside and it was way too crowded to eat inside because the fish tacos are 99cents each. On Thursdays the meat tacos are 99cents each.

*UPDATE* Feb 2018
I recently also tried the barbacoa tacos, piña agua fresca and strawberry agua fresca. All three were really good.  I gave it another go with the carne asada and chicken and ordered sopes but their meat still isn't clean so I couldn't eat 80% of it. I even ASK before ordering if their meat has "cuero". The cashier thought I meant skin and had me ask one of the cooks and he said it was clean (but it wasn't like always) -.- so I'll stick to the fish tacos and barbacoa!

*UPDATE* March 2018
Extremely lean meat in my sope!!! I ordered a carne asada sope and I FINALLY got no fat with my meat, it was delicious! I hope they keep it up!!!<//Review><Date>1520830367349<//Date>< Rating>

Great food right next to the movie theater. Fish tacos are great and so is the surf and turf burrito.  The only downside is you can only drink your alcoholic beverages inside and not on the patio.<//text>

Food was decent and the place was busy. They need to be cleaner though. I found a dead fly in my agua fresca. It had to have been in the main drink container because my cup had a lid on it at all times.<//Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>This place serves great portions and at reasonable prices. I've enjoyed every item I've picked on the menu so far. If you go at lunch time, be prepared for a long wait. It's just the way it is, so plan accordingly. The line to place an order goes out the back, so ignore the crowd in front that might be waiting to pick up their order. Find street parking where you can.<//text><user>107452688808292203551</user><user_name>William Sykes</user_name><gmapID>0x80c2c5118c200607:0x13bdafa822b1f768<//gmapID>< pics>

Sooo excited this place opened up! Fish tacos are inexpensive, big & delicious. Not to mention those (free) yummy yellow peppers. If you're in the area & love fish tacos then you gotta stop here. Be aware that lunch hours get very busy. You'll leave satisfied 😌<//review>

Utterly disappointed. Ordered "vegetarian sope" and got half teaspoon of beans. Worse part was their refusal to make it better. Literally shoved plates back!< /text>

<review>The perfect place in my book. It's a Hole In The Wall, Mom & Pop, easy on the wallet and the icing on the cake, serves great food. Their regularly priced menu is affordable. But you can't beat the Tuesday & Thursday taco specials. Tuesday fish tacos. Thursday meat tacos. I'm so glad my wife found this place on yelp. Oh yeah, the service is friendly.

Discovered the perfect time to avoid the lines. Just get there before 5pm. If ya gotta wait, it's still worth it.</review>< rate>

What a great find!
Friends tried the surf and turf burrito and regular tacos.  I had the barbacoa tacos and a dope.
Washed it all down with some agua frescas.
I've recommended this place to a vegan friend of mine, since they do have a vegan menu. Waiting to see what they thought.< /Text><date>1568422270876<//date><user>110586790637161788106<//user>< name>

Decent taste. Bad slow service. Orders take WAY TO LONG. 45 minute wait for tacos? Cmon. They need to find a way to get the orders out faster.< /Text>

<Review>I was visiting my son. He said he had recently discovered a new place for fish tacos. I have been there only once, but I will go back. The tacos were great!!! The restaurant is very small, but clean. No atmosphere to speak of. Food is inexpensive,  but very tasteful. I will go back when in the area again.< /Review>< Pics>

$1 Fish Taco Tuesdays... $1 Meat Taco Thursdays... Yummy!! And regardless of coming here on either a Tuesday or a Thursday the tacos are good and at a good cost too. Their fish tacos are definitely huge and a big portion; I tend to only be able to eat 2-3 of their fish tacos. But so worth.< /text>

<Review>This little place has become one of our favorite "to go" places for a quick or not so quick because its always packed lol drive thru places we just love. We always get the fish and shrimp tacos and my favorite when they have it fresh watermellon drink.  Whatever you're in the mood whether it's carnitas, carne asada tacos or a combo surf n turf burrito you cant go wrong.  I will heed a bit of warning the sauce they put on is a bit too spicy for me so I just ask for no chili sauce and its just perfect.  Enjoy.< /Review>< Pics>

I only go to this place on Tuesday for the fish tacos.  Freaking amazing.  You can order ahead by phone which I highly suggest but be forewarned the lines are long during the lunch rush.  This is a popular spot.  Hot sauces are on points and the condiments bar has everything essential for a great taco spot.</Text>

Great food! But have a website menu& phone number to order BUT DONT ANSWER & have full voicemail! This is not US customer service. Get another line & or worker to handle that. When we go, we like the food, but way slow & obviously not enough employees at high volume times.<//Text>

Bad customer service! The lady (cashier) really disgusting attitude 🤮😠. It was my first time there but never going back again. I give 2 stars only because they have vegan tacos.  But lady please you need to be educated how to welcome customers🤨🤨.<//Review>

< review>
This place is better for fish tacos than Rubio's. It is quickly becoming a local gem. Alhambra needed a place like this where you can get yummy Mexican food in a hip little locale with outdoor seating. It's near Valley/Fremont where the old drive thru donut shop used to be located.

It's suppose to be fast food but the crowd what makes it take long. This place is so popular during lunch time that there is a line out the door but well worth it!< /review>

Great fresh fish tacos! Fried white fish, or you can get it grilled. But, the fried fish taco and fried shrimp tacos are fantastic! Super nice staff too. A must for fish taco lovers.< /text>

Our go-to place for fish tacos and ceviche now. There is a branch on Main Street, but we haven't tried it yet. Good eats. Kids eat free on Wednesdays with minimum $10 purchase.< /text>

If you are a fan of Tacos Baja in East Los Angeles, then you will love these tacos. Hits very close to home and has the chilis as well. Encourage to give it a try
-limited parking
-long lines
-small venue
-very limited seating
-great fish tacos
- everything tasted very fresh.
DRIVE THROUGH IS HORRIBLE.

<Text>I normally go on Tuesdays, but wanted to try the meat Thursdays. For being right after July 4th, and no one barely there I waited over a half an hour for four tacos. Also as other people that ordered after received their food much quicker. Great on Tuesdays, but I'll have to pass at that locale for Thursday dinner.</Text><UserId.>101396165087910216250<//UserId.>< gmapID>

And the rice was bland and overcooked, the beans were bland, and there was so little pico in there most bites you couldn't taste it. Avoid this place!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><text>Fish and shrimp tacos are really good, haven't tried their other meats because I only come here for seafood. Their ceviche tostadas are really good too especially the shrimp and they aren't stingy with the serving. My go to order is 2 fish tacos and a shrimp ceviche tostada perfect pair! Oh parking here sucks if you're going during a busy time (lunch).</text></record>

<text>Apparently know when you ask for Chiles they throw on your face that they are free and could only give you 3 when you buy 11 tacos. Asked Mariah for a manager and she stated that the manager was not there. Maybe you need to put price for the extra Chile’s instead of throwing it on customers that they are free. Which I only asked for 3 extra.< /text>< Pics>

I only ever come on $1 fish taco tuesdays so i can only speak from those experiences. Fish tacos are good but they sometimes skimp out on the cabbage. They have a self-serve section including radishes, seasoned chilis, limes, and pickled red onion. Everytime i have gone there, there is always an item missing. Maybe its just cuz its constantly busy on Tuesdays. Another problem i have with this place is they are not at all accurate with the estimated time for phone orders. I ALWAYS need to add an extra 20 min to whatever time they give me.</review>

<Review>Awesome Mexican food! They started offering vegan options and on Monday's they have $1 off vegan tacos so I had to try some. I had the vegan carne asada and vegan chicken. I liked the 'chicken'! The vegan carne asada was a little dry. Maybe they overcooked it? They also have barbacoa and el pastor. I'll have to try those next time. Btw, I'm not vegan. I'm making a conscious effort to eat less meat when I can. I'm glad to see many places offering vegan options. My kiddo is a vegetarian so that also influenced me to eat less meat. :)
I've also have had their carne asada, fish, and chicken tacos, and the tostadas, and they are all good! Tostada was my fave (carne asada). They have different deals on each day during the weekday.< /Review>< Pics>

Food is good but the lines are ridiculous. Whats the sense of calling ahead and ordering for pickup. I arrived and couldn't even get to the cashier cause there was no line for calls..some were getting upset being cut off by others that were ordering by phone...My suggestion to avoid customers getting into an actual fight in the future.  Create a second line parallel with the ones waiting in line and alternate the customers at the cashier. Food is great but needs work on organization of service.< /review>

Fish and shrimp tacos are good.  The other meats are eh.  The Al Pastor does not have the traditional taste nor does it resemble it.  I had to verify that it was al pastor.  They had a crowd waiting to order.  Got my order wrong.  Their aguas frescas were extra sweet.  Street parking.</Review>

<Review>I WAS FIRST AND LINE, AND THEY TOOK TWO PARTIES ORDERS BEFORE MINE. I just left this establishment and you can bet i won't come back. Check the cameras 824 is when I left. The cashier didn't even acknowledge my existence. Ridiculous. I was literally the only person in the store in line.

<Date>1541882296263<//Date>< Review>
Waited 25-30 minutes in the Drive-Thru. There were only 2 cars in front of me. I ordered eight fish tacos with no Crema.
Rosa who took my order said I cannot make any changes at the drive-thru window everything was as is. All I asked for was no Crema she said she had to get the manager slash owner he said that he would do it one time only. He was not nice, he was arrogant and as he was walking away I told him thank you and he turned around and looked at me and said what did you say and I said thank you.. Rosa said after waiting the half hour/ 25 minutes in line that I would have to walk in if I didn't want any crema on the fish tacos. Very very rude. Won't go there again. There's too many other places to go where the food is just as good and better then there. I didn't ask for anything special I just didn't want the crema on fish tacos. How hard is that to do? Then to have to call the manager to get an okay NOT to add something on it. Totally ridiculous. Those 2 people were very rude to me and didn't show any kind of caring or respect. We as customers sign their paychecks not the boss not the owner but us as customers sign their paychecks. Without us they wouldn't have a job.<//Review>

She then started to converse with him and then told me to wait while she went to the back kitchen somewhere. I was hungry and trying to get help on what to order and couldn't believe that I was told to hold my thoughts after wanting to try this place out for months... Umph especially that the shop was completely empty at the moment. I just left. I guess they must have not cared to make money that day?</Review><user_name>Jessica Sablan< /user_name>< Gmap_id>

Every time we come here, it's busy, but the line moves quickly. I love the choices. They have natural refreshing beverages i.e. cucumber and chia water. Great inexpensive prices.< /Review>

We have been twice and the food is awesome and very well priced.  Today was our second trip and the place was packed.  The owner saw me walking out and asked if I ordered, I said I didn't realize today was cash only so didn't have enough money.  He said no worries, took my order for 20 fish tacos and said bring back cash for pick up so I didn't have to stand in line again.  Anyway, 5 stars for food and great service.  And hey if you guys need a good accounting service let us know!  Briglio and Cheung!</text>

<Text>The last three times I've been here they didn't have potato tacos. How can you be out of something so consistently? Just order more potatoes! You also can't get certain items through the drive thru like grilled shrimp or fish which is just plain stupid. The whole drive thru sucks, you can't even order until you get to the window then you have to wait for your food. Avoid the dive thru and just go inside. The food quality has also gone down since they opened every time I get my order now its a sloppy gross mess in a box I had to eat my tacos with a fork last 2 times I went.<//Text>< pics>

It was my first time at this place took my nephew we heard talk about this place so decide to check it out we got two Campechanas which took forever to come out and when they do they weren't even in the signature cups we got served in regular plastic cup that resemble the small campechana order so right off the bat was disappointed with the presentation I figure if they were gonna take so long might as well down them right they offered to switch them to the bigger cup but don't likey food being tossed back and forth<//text>

So happy they came to Pasadena. I had been going to the one in Alhambra whenever I'm at school, CSULA. When I saw the sign in my own city I was ecstatic about having the homemade horchata at my disposal. Obviously the fish tacos are amazing but the El Pastor is amaaazing too. Plus, how could you pass the yellow chiles with their special powder seasoning. I can never get enough. See you guys soon!!! Next on my list is trying the carne asada fries or the Chile relleno burrito!< /text>

Visited Baja Cali Fish &Tacos for lunch ,order a shrimp burrito .This shrimp burrito did not have the flavor i expected it needs some flavor on the breaded shrimp and a flavorish sauce in order to make it good ,i think is overpriced .on the customer service side its aweful employees  here need to have sense of customer service ,you have to understand that people humans get grouchy when we hungry and a bad attitude from an employee could set them off and not enjoy their food .i had no problems with them cause i always have a smile in my face for everybody :).< /text>

Similarly, their burrito (barbacoa) is particularly good not to mention the agua frescas. Staff are nice, competent and friendly. Indoor and outdoor seating is neat and organized. Parking lot is very very limited albeit nearby street parking is available. Prices are relatively affordable and it won't break your 💰wallet. Overall, I give it ☆☆☆☆ food/drinks and ☆ parking space.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

We had fish tacos, asada tacos, fish and shrimp burrito, fish ceviche tostada. Everything was so good. I highly recommend this spot. New to Alhambra, it's nice having a fish taco spot that actually has good tacos. Can't wait to go back!</Review>

Had dinner on Friday night with my husband. I ordered 2 shrimp tacos, and a small shrimp cocktail. The shrimp tacos were good. The shrimp cocktail, had no flavor, didn’t taste fresh. The tomatoes, onion and cilantro, tasted like they had come out of a jar 😒 Husband has a shrimp ceviche tostada. He said it was good. He also had an aguachile tostada. I have to say, it was the worst aguachile we’ve ever had. The shrimp was cooked in water, not lemon, even tho I asked the cashier and she confirmed it was cooked in lemon😑 the sauce had no chilie, it was a green sauce with a lot of black pepper. & the tostada has nothing but red onions 😩 the plate was so heavy, and it was just onion!!< /review>

<review>Very tasty, reasonably cheap fish tacos.Nicely fried, flavorful, with tasty sides and sauce.  It seems like they have dollar fish tacos on Tuesday which I will for sure be coming back for.
I found that other items on the menu were closer to average. The pastor and carne asada tacos I had were both relatively tasty, but the meat itself didn't seem to be of great quality. The "crab" ceviche is actually made of imitation crab(I should have known from the cheap price). The strawberry agua fresca is delicious and not too sweet. Their condiment and sides bar is extensive, with radishes, onions, and large banana peppers available.

The service is just okay, and we had to wait a decent amount of time for our food.

Overall I would definitely come back and probably just order the fish tacos.</review>< pictures>

After waiting in line for 30mins and then waiting for my food another 30mins I sure had high expectations. After eatting my first fish taco I can truly say that I was not let down. I'll be coming back for sure.< /review>

The fish tacos crack every time! I have never ever, literally ever had a bad taco there, ever. Never. Never, like not possible. The wait is worth it, it's a small place so just call pick up or be prepared to hang a lil if it's crowded.<//Text>

<Text>A Restaurant I've Supported for Years comes to a End. I spent $40 on Fish Tacos and asked for Condiments and got additiude from the Monitor gal. I asked for Sour Cream on the Side with my order from the start, I Checked my order and I got No Sour Cream, Gave me 1 Soggy Bottom chilli and Onion baggy. I asked nicely if there were any more to cover for large order, I got excuses additiude and was told to wait outside which I gladly wanted to for there were people without mask waiting in the dining area. My wife and I will Never Go there. Not Worth the Stress Disrespectful Additiude and Money,  Adios Baja Cali Fish Tacos.<//Text></record>

(Translated by Google) Well, as I eat the best tacos in Tijuana, Mexico. I can say after many failed searches for good Mexican food in the United States, Baja Cali are the most similar. The little one, it does not work.

(Original)
Pues, como yo como los mejores tacos en Tijuana, México. Puedo decir despues de muchos fallidas busquedas de buena comida mexicana en Estados Unidos, Baja Cali son lo más parecidos. El menudo, no sirve.< /Review>
