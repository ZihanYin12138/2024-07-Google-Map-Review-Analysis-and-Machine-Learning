H i, first let me say this; I normally don't give reviews. In this case I felt I should share my latest experience. I went by PS after receiving a call from the office, about my lock. Last thing I needed to add to my already busy schedule. Right! I was greeted by two young ladies, Jackie and Maddison. Jackie's warm smile and  kind positive words was an inspiration. I soon realized their concerns were for the safety of my storage. The staff at PS are very helpful and I also found the property to be clean, safe and affordable.</text>

On Wednesday 11/11/2020 I had a reservation for a unit Andrea welcome me very polite and professional. She explained me the contract and their policy very clearly. The only bad thing was that the unit I wanted was rented out before I got there but Andrea found me an unit that is close to the elevator/stairs. Good customer service by Andrea 👍🏻< /text>

<review>Dirty trick to play on people shows the companies integrity to lie to people and say that they're trying to help you when they really just want to screw you over. I would never store with this company ever and I recommend that nobody should either customer service sure face to face but not over the phone they lie and they screw you over completely</review>< Pics>

Had a wonderful experience here at the mission Blvd Public Storage. I have used their services for over a year now and I’d just like to commend the facility and staff to anyone looking for a safe clean place for their storage needs. The attendant Madison took care of all our needs and was very personable in regards to the process and any other help that I’ve needed. I would truly recommend this place to everyone and I also want to send a special thanks to Madison who was always more than willing to accommodate our needs. She was always present to make sure the site was clean and that our needs were taken care of.<//Text>

<review>I’ve been renting at this location since 2014, I am always greeted with smiling faces. I have never had a problem with them except the rent increases from time to time. Today I talked with a wonderful young lady named Madison, I explained to her how I felt and she was so understanding and ready to help. I really appreciated that.

Public storage does an amazing job finding amazing people to be the faces to their company! Five stars from me!
Keep up the good work Madison.< /review>< Pics>

Nichole at the Hayward location on mission was great. Arrived right before closing and she helped me with everything I needed. I did feel rushed she showed me my option and just took care of me. She was very kind respectful and second to none on her customer service skills. I would refer this place to anyone especially having a manager like Nichole. Thanks again!!!<//Review>

With many available storage options out there, we decided on this location as they have either met or exceeded all areas of criteria we were looking for in a Storage company.....Security, cleanliness and most importantly customer service support.

Upon meeting Nicole her personality was bubbly and inviting. Nicole was able to help us with information in deciding which storage size was perfect for our needs and even went as far as to walk and tour each unit so we could have a visual idea of the space offered. Mind you it's a pretty huge lot and each unit offered was not in the same building location so kudos to her for her patience and willingness! Each unit shown was clean and undamaged. Hallways leading to units had good ample amounts of lighting, great access to elevator lifts/stairways and had security cameras that kept watch.

When it came to pricing Nicole made everything pleasant as can be. She was able to quote us a price that was cheaper than what we initially reserved online and for a much bigger unit! All in all our experience with Nicole and public storage has been an extremely exceptional one and would recommend to anyone.</text>

<Text>First time here at Public Storage, on the fly and found a very good price. The property manager Ms. Maddison was extremely professional, knowledgeable, bubbly, and personable.

I walked in to do some research, only needing a storage for less than a month and Maddison explained exactly how much I would be paying out of pocket for that. I came back a week later, Maddison showed me the available unit and I did the paperwork to get the rental. She made the process easy and I thank her for that very much.<//text>

The process was quick and she was able to answer any questions I had. She also upgraded me to a downstairs unit for the same rate as the upstairs when she informed me those had ran out. Lucky me!! She made my day with her wonderful personality! Her customer service skills are above and beyond.  🙂🙂</text>< pictures>

This facility has easy access and a professional staff on site to assist customers.  I had a really good experience with Dawn while working on my storage unit.  She was friendly, professional and responsive to my questions.  I appreciate her taking the extra step to print receipts and ensure that the transactions on my account were updated and accurate.  She is an outstanding employee.</text>

We were treated very nicely and there was no issue what so ever. We received help from Maddison. The experience was great overall. I would recommend this storage renting place to anyone. We were offered everything we needed and gave us advice on things that had to do with our storage unit. I liked how it was quick and to the point. She actually answered  every question we had and she payed attention to us and our doubts. Overall amazing experience and would return there again.< /text>

A while ago, I had rented spaces from this facility for more than a decade and relocated.  I returned and decided to store some things at the same PS. The previous managers have retired but I received SUPER service from Nikki !  Great deal --- professional and informative she was--quick process, answered all of my questions...…  Glad I came back to my 'alma mater' public storage spot !  Keep up the good work Nikki!  :-)<//Review>

Maddison and Nikki were so friendly. Extremely supportive to all renters not just me. They worked well together even when systems went down. They were seen all over the property cleaning and helping direct us to where we could get thing. Im so grateful we moved to this storage unit.< /text>

<Text>Maddison is a true professional and every Public Storage facility should have an employee like her. She represents the company well and she gives great customer service. She is kind, professional and helpful.

Thank you Maddison for all your help

This review is for JoJo at the front desk at this location.  I came in with my uncle and we were very impressed how JoJo conducted herself with her knowledge of Public Storage.  We thought she was in management and had been with the company a long time with the knowledge she had.  Our time there was efficient and comfortable.  Her customer service was stupendous!  Thanks JoJo.< /text>

I spoke to Ana and she was extremely helpful and answered all my questions. she was very detailed and friendly. I later on went in to look at the property and will be getting a storage unit there.The employees are awesome! friendly and extremely helpful.< /Review>

We came here in a rush and with a time crunch. Maricela was very helpful in getting us squared away in a timely fashion. She explained everything very professionally and courteously. She saved us by offering us the long utility cart when she heard we only had a small dolly from uhaul. I am so thankful for her help!!</Text>

my experience here has been good. I have at times had trouble paying, however the staff has worked with me continuously. The staff is courteous and moves quickly to describe contract information and pleasant all around. The location is convenient and in a corner which I like.

12/3/2014 Today I went to my storage and noticed a man by himself in his unit sitting on his stuff like he was in his home relaxing. he looked like he was under the influence by the blistering red eyes. I was alone and when I got out the car he checked me out and also was trying to look into my car. So when I went up to my storage on the second floor where there was no one around I closed the door because I wanted to take precaution. A woman named Maria saying she was the manager which I have never seen before since I began renting here in March, abruptly opened the door to my storage as I was going through my boxes and started asking me questions. She had disgusted look on her face and was asking what I was doing and why my door was closed. Completely startled I immediately got frustrated. She told me I was not allowed to have the door closed and could not be on the premises for more than 45 minutes.  I have never been told anything like this and I have been at my storage everyday this week speaking to another associate and was not given any of the information this supposed manager was saying. I have made a complaint and there is a strong possibility I won't be renting here much longer.< /Review>

<name>Michael Rangel< /name><review>Nadine was so knowledgeable and friendly
her customer service was off the charts. In the future I will continue to use public storage on Mission Blvd  and I will recommend them to friends and family. If you're looking for a quality storage facility with 5 star customer service look no further than 29824 Mission Blvd, Hayward. Ask for Nadine she was so helpful and knowledge she also gets 5 stars.</review>< rating>

Closes way too early. Also there is no prorated rent. If you use 1 day you owe for the entire month. Facility is clean and staff is polite. The restricted hours of 9-6 leave much to be desired.< /review>

I rented a space here earlier this month, I was very pleased with the customer service provided by Maddison the property manager. Not to mention she is VERY pregnant, but still very outgoing!

I did not purchase a lock that day, but when I came back to start putting things inside my space I did. When going back up to the space to take their lock off, we realized there were two huge wooden boards in my space that we didn’t see due to chit chatting the day I rented. I didn’t even have to say anything, Maddison got them out right away. I don’t know how she did it being about 7 or 8 months pregnant, but she did!

I am very pleased with my experience so far. I am also looking forward to seeing that baby some day.
Thank you again Maddison for all your help and sorry I didn’t write a review sooner.
Again congratulations on the baby.</text>

I would not recommend this storage to anyone.   They will increase the rates anytime for any reason.  Gate ours are very inconvenient, 9am to 6pm.  I had to take time off work when ever I needed to get to my unit.  Management is rude and unprofessional.  Rachelle, the district manager is very rude and unprofessional, she never had a professional respond to my inquiries.   We had a large unit and delayed our move out because we didn't have time to go in during their gate hours, but finally we moved and we are very happy at the new storage unit on Hesperian by Costco. We are paying about $100 less that what Public Storage was charging us and we have more convenient gate hours and better security.   I would highly suggest you do some research and look for other options.  We have alot of storage places in Hayward I am sure you will find something better.    Good luck.</review>

Be careful they are known for breaks-ins.
When you ask to see the video they will give you a million excuses as to why they don't have it. Rachelle, the so called district manager has bad customer service skills, if you ask questions which she can't answer she will give you attitude.   Just save yourself a headache and don't rent here.   We are lucky to have so many options and you would expect management to know this and try to keep their customers happy but obviously they don't care.   Sad.<//review>

<text>What a joke this place is. Raised the rent of our storage space 50 percent in the last 5 years. Reduced their hours so they're only open bankers hours. Who the hell has time to take off work to go to their storage unit? My husband and I actually had to leave work early to get to this place to drop off our Christmas decorations. We arrived 5 minutes after their (ridiculous) closing time due to traffic. The girl who works there literally made eye contact with us and then shut the blinds in our faces a we approached the window. Wow, what awesome customer service. In the future I guess we'll buy new decorations every year and then throw them out rather than spend $1500 annually for this sh*try service. Save your money (and the precious time of the rude girl who works there) and take your business someplace else.</text>< Pictures>

The people at the desk are either NOT there (always hang a sign saying they're out), not courteous, not professional or just not happy to work there.
We have been asking for them to replace the ONE LIGHT BULB in our unit for six months now. Bulb is still out. We try and come in to pay and they're out.

We'll be looking to go somewhere else to store our things.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><time>1476923480480<//time><resp>None< /resp>< username>

A rating of one star is actually being generous.  I am so upset right now.  Public Storage units are not cheap.  I had one of the smallest ones, and paid $150 a month for it.  For a long time.  Which is insane but that's another story.  I finally decided to evacuate, and to my dismay, my unit had a rat and roach infestation.  It was the grossest thing I have ever seen.  All my furniture was scratched and torn up by rats I'm assuming and there were rat droppings everywhere.  I also saw roaches in the unit.  I had planned to donate my stuff to Salvation Army but when I saw the condition of it, I knew they wouldn't accept it and frankly, I would be ashamed to try to even donate it so I cancelled the pickup.  I spoke with the district manager, and told her that I needed for the unit to be cleared out and that I didn't feel I should have to pay for it.  In my opinion it was unsafe to even enter the unit!  It smelled so bad!  She did NOT agree, and I thought that I was being extremely reasonable in not asking for a refund for all the months that I had paid for what has turned out to be a rat and roach motel!  I am so mad.  The worst part is, it seems that this is just a normal part of doing business for them.  Like it wasn't a big deal or surprising that they had a rat infestation.  Be warned, they apparently do not do anything to safeguard against rats or roaches, and they HAVE to know that they have a rat problem.  Before I even opened my unit, I could smell it!  I have never had such a horrible experience with any company.  All of my stuff is ruined because of their negligence, and they have the nerve to ask me to pay to clear it out when it's in such a state that I would rather DIEE than go in there.  Honestly it was so gross, I feel they shouldn't even WANT me to clear it out because I could be attacked by a rat/whatever other animals are residing in there, and that could lead to a lawsuit.  But they probably have some shady way to get out of that too - I tried talking to someone else, and she was like "well, your contract says you are storing at your own risk".  I am not taking this sitting down and they are going to wish they paid for me to clear it out.< /review>

My storage unit got broken into and the security cameras were turned towards the wall so there's no evidence.  The police have been contacted and a claim filed, but I feel so violated and public storage employees seemed very unsympathetic.  One star because I had to put a star to add this comment.< /review>

<UserId.>117546676066995146219<//UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures><review>I thought this place was ok at first the girl had everything set up for me when I had a last minute move which was awesome the prices are kind of high!  The gate hours changed to earlier times which is not cool. I've been locked inside one time over nite because I didn't want to leave my car because I lost track of time and gates wouldn't open and the person on site was out for that weekend.  But I also ended up staying on the property for like a month and I wasn't the only one there are many people living in their units at this location. One thing for sure is the staff does not clean bathrooms or hall areas of the units and if so it's not done daily at all!! I don't think I've ever seen them do lock checks during the time I was there, which is not good!! The corporate office should really investigate this facility or just even observe activity on the property after hours because now that I'm being asked to terminate my agreement due to violations of contract which is trespassing on property for being here when I'm not suppose to, well like I said there are many people on the premises if you review cameras you can see people going through the gates and using code when not permitted and I think their mostly friends and relatives of the people who live on the property that's a given and when I go use the bathroom in the morning theirs a guy who sleeps in the restroom comes out with a blanket who is also one who stays here and they pick on me which I at least clean my mess and clean up the garbage around my building section because I can see the staff doesn't so I will alert the proper people to handle this matter and report this to the BBB and the owners or anyone above them should investigate property cameras add sensor in hall ways even add more cameras because they are allowing more people to move in here and I feel disrespected because I'm not doing anything different then what they were. You can smell marijuana coming out of the front onsite live in house and they are just out of control!  Ann is very rude she didn't greet me and didn't have a smile and I asked her who she was and replied who are you and I only asked her because I wanted to speak with district manager and didn't know who she was and Ann just snapped back with major attitude!  I highly do not recommend this place!!!!< /review>< date>

I rented a storage unit at this place in 2016 & 2017 and thiis place had a rat infestation problem. I told the staff and even spoke with the manager but she didn't care to fix anything. Almost everything was either destroyed or depreciated in value because of the damage. I regret I didn't sue these people and let them get away with recklessness.< /Text>

<Name>That one guy<//Name><review>DO NOT RENT HERE! My husband and I suspect the district Manager aka Jose Ornales, of this site has stolen about $5000 worth of our personal belongings. Our storage unit went unpaid and therefore we defaulted into Lien. The District Manager thought we were not going to pay our storage fees and therefore, cut our lock and ransacked our property. He was the only one who cut our lock and the only one who had access to our property.

We are missing the following items and will be suing Public Storage.
1. White Gold Male's Wedding Ring with 5 diamonds worth $2000
2. Compound Turkey Bow worth approx. $500.00
3. 20 Target Arrows worth $50.00
4. P90x Brand new in the box worth approx $100
5. Redline Bicylce worth approx. $1000
6. BlueRay/DVD with 10 cordless speaker surround system brand new in the box worth approx. $400  7. Box of DVD's/Blue Ray worth over $500
8. Check Book
9. My husbands grandfathers 24k gold pocket watch engraved (NOT REPLACEABLE)

Totaling all this up this equals over $5000 worth of personal belongings. CONVENIENTLY once you go into Lien, Public Storage cancels your insurance therefore nothing is covered! Good thing we have receipts and we will be prosecuting and suing Public Storage. We have called the Police Department and made a theft report. The suspect will be interviewed this week. CONVENIENTLY when the cop asked the District Manager where the security footage is he can't find it. Jose the district manager openly admitted that our locks were in tact when he cut them off. He openly admits his locks were in tact when he replaced ours and he openly admits he was the only one who had access to our storage unit ruling out any other suspects. He has no pictures of our storage unit as required by state law. The cop said when speaking to the suspect, District Manager aka Jose Ornales aka THEIF, he believes he stole our stuff because he kept getting his story mixed up. However nothing can be proven just yet.

While we were on site discovering our property missing, another storage customer was screaming and cussing at the lady from the office because he was violated as well. He also had his belongings stolen from the same site. Probably from the same employee.

DO NOT RENT here. I can't imagine that all facilities are like this but 29824 Mission Blvd has THIEVES working for them. We will be suing.<//review><UserId.>105906005635259045985<//UserId.>< date>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I visited this studio while traveling on business in San Francisco. The front desk was incredibly responsive with getting me set up for class and the studio has a nice layout compared to some others, which don’t allow enough space to move. They provide towels, which is a plus and not often found at other studios. But the BEST thing about this studio is Quinton. He was an incredible coach. Very patient when offering corrections and motivating each person to push past limits. What a gem!  I hope to be back soon.< /review>< Pics>

<review>My first class was an awesome experience. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Jessica made me feel like no question was silly and helped me understand the theory behind the heart rate monitor. Coach Rio was very helpful and kind! I was worried because I am post-op for a hip surgery about 6 1/2 months ago. I got a really good workout in without hurting myself or my hip. I also was able to get the correct form so I work my muscles and reduce stress to my injured side. The class dynamic was also awesome - some of it was individual work and at the end there was a team activity.

I’ve been to another two clases now. Coach Q was very supportive and made sure that I modified any activities that were bothering my hip. He also explained how to use the rower step by step, and the numbers you see on the screen. Now I feel confident to use any of the machines in the studio.

I highly recommend you go to the introductory class! You don’t be disappointed!!< /review><time>1522427118556< /time><Rating>5</Rating>< pictures>

<Review>It's so motivating to track your numbers and try to beat your record each day. Instead of being competitive with one another, I love that you only need to be competitive with yourself. The teachers are so motivating and the front desk staff is so friendly. I'm addicted!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Interesting class that focuses on quickly shifting heart rate by having you alternate between comfortable walking pace and intense periods of exertion. Feasible for all fitness levels since you set your own 'base pace'. Rating three stars because I am not at all into the heart rate chest straps you are instructed to wear as they cause significant discomfort when running. Also, note that not designed for after class showers or lingering: small narrow waiting area + only two showers.<//Text>

I love that each class is different! In 6 months that I have been a member, every class has been designed and constructed to keep the workout exciting and motivating. Repetition in workouts get boring and OrangeTheory keeps me going💪🏽</Text>

<Review>Small fitness studio with guided group classes/workouts, boot camp-style. Depending on time of day, you can get from a few people to a crowded room (I believe 24 is the max, which is a lot of people for its small space).

Coaches are friendly and the heart rate monitor workout helps you keep track of your goals and target. I feel that sometimes some of the coaches try to push people to go farther/faster/heavier than they should, but of course you're not forced into it.

Nice premium fitness studio, not for the light of wallet. Similar concept/style in many ways to Barry's Fitness (which is literally across the street from them); except, I like the space at Orangetheory better, because you can see outdoors and it's not a dark, enclosed windowless tunnel like the Barry's across the street.

Overall a really good workout with good facilities and friendly coaches. Really needs more bathrooms/showers (they only have 2 each), but they literally have no more space.< /Review>< pics>

Great set of people -- both staff and trainers as well as the others working their way through the workout.  Each day is different, and I love getting the immediate view of where my heart rate is so that I know how hard I am working.</review>

< Review>
This place offrs the most delicious tasting burgers in town in my opinion, the place looks very clean, the customer service is amazing, they are so friendly and generous.
To top that off their menu prices are very reasonable, I have been ordering their burgers with double pattie it costs 5 something and the one pattie is 4 something. And trust me my meal is usually oversized but the double pattie gets me full every time</Review>

<resp>None< /resp><review>Got the "Loaded Dog" from this place and from the look of this, you tell me if this hot dog is loaded with delicious ingredients to make you want to eat it? Nope, I'm sorry, for over FOUR bucks (including tax), this hot dog is the most disappointing, UNLOADED hot dog ever! If you want a hot dog, please go elsewhere. I love to support small business owners, but this is beyond underwhelming, and they even use Wienerschnitzel-branded cup lids for their drinks. Hmmm.....I wonder why. Anyway, unfortunately I paid an overpriced hot dog from a misleading name on the menu.

Side Note: during lunch time, there were a couple of guys blocking the hallway towards the restroom at the back because of their prayer time. I think they know the owners and asked for permission to pray at that area. I respect all religions, but during business hours, I think this is disruptive and disrespectful of dining customers wanting to use the restroom after their meal.< /review>< userid>

The food was amazing. Also the best fries I've had in the US.

The place was clean and tidy.

The service was second to none.

I will definitely go back if I'm given the opportunity.</Text>

<text>This is the best location around. I've never encountered a rude employee. They answer questions efficiently. Good amount of parking in front and there's street parking if the lot fills up. My packages get scanned quickly. It has easy freeway access for quick in and out drop offs. I especially enjoyed the off-site drop off during the holidays. I loved that.</text>< pictures>

If I make it into this post office I try to use the self service machine. It is available right in the lobby.  You don't have to go where the clerks are.  The customer service is not the best but I have had much worse experiences.  Yet to get a passport from here so that may or may not change my opinion.  A heads up... self service machine does not take cash only card.< /Review>

< Review>
Where to begin? I have a po box, where mail is routinely delivered late. One time, a first class letter took FOUR (4) WEEKS to be delivered!

Hours when the front box area open are never predictable for those of us on a time schedule.

Wait times for a clerk are often at least half an hour when the line is longer than seven customers.  They and carriers  provide contradictory information often in broken English.

These are just the problems that are bugging me right at this moment..<//Review>

<gmap_id>0x809ad755d43ea705:0x7bd455ad0bd444ee< /gmap_id><Text>Very unprofessional employees at this location. You can tell employees don’t care. Customers were told that this site was understaffed, which is why there are incredible long wait times for mail pick-up. As we are all feeling the effects from this unfortunate pandemic, however, it does not make it ok to treat people so rudely. There are so many people out of a job and they would give anything to be their shoes working. If you don’t like your job, then quit. No one is forcing you to work here.

I am currently at this facility now, they open at 10:00 and got here at 9:30 to ensure I was early. Mail pick-up door was not opened till 10:10. It is almost 11:00 and still have not seen anyone come back to the door and I was the first person in line.</Text>< Date>

I don't even know where to start. We have been chasing around a package for a week. The carrier said he was unavailable to deliver to our place, yet somehow we have Amazon, UPS, FedEx delivering to our place without any trouble what so ever.
Their customer service is to send you home with a phone number that never answers. I have been twice at the office for the same issue and the same thing happens, they take my phone number and said they are going to call back and you guess it! The never call you back!. This is coming for a supervisor since I requested to talk to them. Very poor management, I have to give it one star because half wasn't available.< /Text>

This is the WORST post office. The wait times are terrible, employees don't know what they are doing, nobody answers the phone lines, calls are not made back when promised. I have been trying to get a key to a new mailbox and have gotten the run around for 4 months. I put a written request in (with a supervisor) for a new lock which they said would take about 5 days and they'd call me when ready- it's been 15 and still no call. HORRIBLE customer service.< /review>

This post office needs to hire more people and be considerate of people's time. Shut this place down or hire more people and get some air conditioning. There are people actually depending on their mail and to have such horrible service something needs to be done about this. Get some radios, some phone lines or exchange numbers amongst each other so we can be better served at this post office.

Thanks,

your friendly community of YOUR area.<//Text>

The worst post office ever. I recently closed my P.O. Box. I have been waiting over a month for the office to forward my mail and they have not sent my mail to the other post office yet. I have multiple boxes that I paid for just sitting because management is to lazy to do their job. I have contact the usps customer services and will be sending Megan Brennan a personal letter on the quality of service and lack of professionalism. Stop using CoVID-19 as a crutch to not do one simple thing< /Review>

<text>My experience was from 1:30pm-4:30pm on a Friday.  This place is a joke.  Insufficient parking in lot.  Only 30 minute parking on the street.  I enjoyed a three hour wait.  30 minutes of which I spent in the USPS line which was packed and was only be attended to by one USPS employee.  Just FYI, the Passport office is on the north side of the building past the USPS counter from the parking lot.  There are signs on the Northern side of the building directing you but I didn't notice any walking in from the parking lot.  There is no public bathroom.  Eventually I left and went down the street to REI to use their bathroom.  At least they use a ticket system so I didn't loose my place in line.  They're horribly understaffed.  All the employees have signs on their desks asking you not to talk to them while they're with customers and directing people to the travel.state.gov website.  There's no one to answer questions so individuals do come up to talk to them and are told to wait.  Eventually the employee who had been the only one servicing the USPS counter came and helped with Passports.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3WPhgo9_NqDBHybAkVVrLhEr1N90yYfWYt3rL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyY5vMuBnLg7brrQ84iR3p2FJjrn0cdDr1DyLV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPR7TLaq8vLDQJ39Nan0TaIQYHlPcV3BPlbdWq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Went to post office today to mail a letter. Standing in line we noticed attitudes of the postal office. Gentleman in front of me was mailing a box.  The lady working had a c-collar  on. Asked the guy if his box was heavy, saying she only had use of one arm. The box wasn’t that big. With an attitude was asking the guy about his  package.  Was quite rude if you ask me. Then it was my turn, when I got to the desk, I asked for a priority box to put my paperwork in (because the stock out in lobby was empty. I was given box and told to go back to the end of the line, and fill out a label because others were waiting too.  I handed the lady instantly a label I already had filled out, telling her she and they could wait till I folded the box, because it wasn’t my fault they had no boxes ready for me.  I was not going to go back in a 20min wait line.  The post office needs to staff with people who can actually do the work and ones without attitudes.  Also, pickup door outside had a line of like 9 people, and no one helping them..</Text>

I have had worst customer service at this location. I rented post office box before I went to location and am regretting having to go and speak to any representatives. They constantly give me answers in conflict with what I am told from Main Post Office in San Francisco. Showing training is lacking or completely missed.<//Review>

I was in and out in less than 30 minutes for a passport renewal. I was completely surprised because I expected to be there all afternoon on a Sunday. When I arrived 10 people were ahead of me but the line moved pretty fast. I saw another review stating "no bathroom" but there is one available. You just have to ask. The clerks were all friendly and pleasant.</text>

This place needs to train its employees on customer service and how to answer a phone. I needed a package held at the post office because it required a signature and no one was going to be home. I was told no problem and it would be held. When I called the post office all day on Saturday no one picked up! It was supposed to be there Saturday and I got nothing! Finally on Monday after calling for 3 hours I had to call from a different number to even reach someone. The lady that answered was SO RUDE! And she said it went out for delivery when it wasnt supposed to leave the post office!!!! She told me she would call me back and I still haven't heard anything from them!

To top it off it said my package got delivered and signed for. I'm pretty sure the mail main signed it ILLEGALLY and delivered it in my mail box. I have never been so mad at someone in customer service and I'm a calm person from working in customer service for years.

A week ago I had to pick up a package and waited 45 minutes and was told maybe someone will help you! I hate this post office and I hope I dont have to go back!</review>

<review>Not sure why this branch even has a phone. They have never bothered to pick it up when I have tried to call....EVER!!!  Probably one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. What cracks me up is when you call the federal Post Office, they can't wait to have you take a customer satisfaction survey after you have spoken to an agent. The problem is the wait time to speak to an agent is between an hour and an hour and a 1/2. Absolutely ridiculous...what a joke!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809ad755d43ea705:0x7bd455ad0bd444ee<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Review>My daughter and I were at the Royal Oaks Post office, trying get a money order and mail out an application for renewing her passport.  I was at the main counter and I had few questions regarding the application. I wanted to make sure we do everything correct before closing the envelope. I asked the clerk, her name was Kiran where I put the pics on the application.  She was so rude and disrespectful, she’s replied,  are you not wearing your glasses that you can not see?????? My daughter was so upset with her, I am disabled and have many issues, including vision and memory problems.  She was so rude I will file a complaint with Consumer Affairs!!! If she can’t handle her job she shouldn’t be there! She had a strong accent on top of that, could barely understand what she’s saying!  I will never go back to that location again!   Will further file  a complaint, make sure this matter gets followed up on.  Kiran has a Disgusting attitude!!!!!< /Review>< resp>

I'm frustrated! I'm trying to call you 3rd day in the row and you are not picking up the phone! I tried 3 different numbers. I'm literally calling all day, every few minutes. I have an emergency, you are holding my package, that supposed to be returned long time ago. I'm loosing my customers. Even employees from different post office from Sacramento are surprised that you are still holding my package! What should I do to contact you, I leave to far to go there by myself!</text>

<text>Our daughter 12 went on camping to Barney Falls with her friend's family this month and sent a post card to her grand parents in Japan. She took a long time to write in Japanese and English and draw a cute  picture of her doing some activity at the camp site. She came home and we found out that she  put a stamp to the US without knowing..that's not enough for international. My friend told me how hard she tried to write this card but we were sad to find out that the post card probably won't be going anywhere. Today, we got a phone call from her grandpa saying they received her postcard!! They were very happy to receive a special post card from her. We talked on face time and he showed me the card. There was a stamp shows insufficient stamp but they still delivered it to Japan. We were so touched. This post card was mailed out from Sacrament post office. We appreciate their kind heart. We would like to say thank you to them!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

really rude employees! Do you like when people answer you like you're stupid? How about when they roll their eyes at you? Then boy, this is the place for you! Come on down and you won't ever have to worry about receiving good customer service. I love when people frown at me and make me feel like I'm wasting their time. Why be polite and friendly, when you can make it obvious that you hate your job? 0/10 will definitely come back when I'm ready for another example of how not to work customer service.</review>

All the staff were very helpful especially Jason needed to ask some questions regarding a money orders which he answered professionally.
Also had to go to the passport office there, was able to get my form and pictures prepared, which was great, thanks to all the staff at that office, especially Sadie who was professional & knowledge.
Highly recommended this this post office for business / passports< /Text>

I know a lot of people who work for the USPS. They are nothing like the employees at this post office. It's unfortunate for me that this is the post office that my packages go to to be held, and it's unfortunate that this is the post office that sends my packages out for delivery at the apartment complex I live at. Apparently, the way they deliver packages to the apartment complex is writing down the list of packages they are "supposed" to deliver, and then dropping off any packages in the truck. They don't check to ensure that all of the packages they say they are dropping off are actually there. I went to ask if they could check somehow, and they said that it's the leasing office of the apartment complex's fault for not checking the delivery.

They kept telling me to go to the leasing office. The leasing office doesn't have it, even though the post office claims that they do. When the woman behind the counter pretended to check for my package in the back, she kept repeating the wrong number. I had to say the actual number over and over, but she was not really looking (I said it was a package and she kept looking at flat envelopes).

Honestly, if I were to have the same worth ethic as the employees of this post office, I would have been fired many times over. I don't understand why they make the post office experience worse than getting a root canal.<//Text>

Sad the Royal Oaks post office lost a package that required a signature,  I was home with the door open.  Postman said he knocked & rang.  Anyway, I  went to receive package after the date & package has been missing every since.  We have gone in & called but gotten nothing  but the run around.  We have been promised a return call but it has been over 2 weeks & no call.  I don't think the package was misplaced but stolen considering the contents inside & the inability to get insurance on the items.  It is sad & a terrible  feeling when one can't even trust where your mail is delivered. SMH😔😔<//text>

This place is a mistake. We know USPS is insolvent. If you can renew your passport by mail do it. If you have to come here. Well bring some beers or wine.</review>

A very busy place, especially at their later closing time!
The staff was very pleasant and helpful, even the branch manager, Mitch, assisting customers in the lines .... helping to make things move as smoothly and quickly as possible. It was impressive to me how a positive atmosphere was maintained through a very hectic situation. Other branches would do well to emulate them . . .< /Text>

Want to get in and out fast for passport? Just prepare EVERYTHING (form, copies of every paperwork, photos) at home to save time and money and come super early :) and i mean super early like before they even open because there will be a line. Got there at 10:00 am, open at 10:30 am. I'm the 5th person in the line and the process of waiting + everything is 2 hours got out at 12:00 pm...Not so bad.<//text>

Omg this is horrible. I'm here on a Saturday and there's only ONE lady processing passports. If they had a vending machine it might be tolerable but I don't even see a water fountain. This is kind of inefficient government facility that breeds hostility.< /text>

The line is nothing to play with. I suggest you get there as early as possible. I got there 15 minutes before opening and only made it to the waiting list. The two women Janet and Merlita did a great job with getting people in and out. The wait is worse than the DMV but they did a great job being just the two of them. I was able to get my passport done although I was on the no guarantee list. I am very happy!<//text>

This office hours of operations are from 10:30am to 6:30pm, today Monday 03/04/19 i got at this office at 4:45pm there was not a lot of people waiting and there was a sign saying they were not taking more applications for passport, I was upset because i drove almost an hour thru traffic to make it on time and they  did this. They should place on the interenet that they don't take anymore applications after certain hour so people don't drive there. Very dissapointed service, poor service..</review>

By the time the Passport Office open, their was about 25 people behind me. If it wasn't for me having a copy of a copied birth certificate, I would have been in and out in less than 25 minutes.  Unfortunately I was sent away. However I came back at about 1:15 pm with the correct birth certificate, and their was only 3 people ahead of me. Hope this helps.< /review>< Pics>

Constantly deliver mail to anyone as long as thy live in the same street as me. Don't take letters away unless they have something to put in that's a bill. Never leave advertisements  or leave 20/30 in one mailbox. Just overall lazy  staff that reschedule deliveries days after their scheduled delivery date which I sometimes pay extra for. One woman casually walks down the streets on the phone and literally told me to shut up when I asked her why she skipped my house even though I had outgoing mail. I would normally value the hard work of our countries mail carriers but the ones on my street simply never do their jobs correctly.< /Text>

<Review>I am posting negatively about a business for the first time ever. If I ever take the time to post it is usually for great customer service, or satisfaction.

Today I showed up at the royal oaks post office to have my passport reinstated. The time states that you can do this up until 6:30 in the post office, office. Mind you I understand I need to be there before that to actually get it taken care of. I got there at 6:15, and the doors were locked. There was an Asian man, not calling him a gentleman, behind the desk, right by the closed doors. I tried to open them three times and he didn't look up. I politely knocked, and no look. I decided to try to open the doors harder, maybe I was just mistaken by how the door opens? Nope, they were locked and the Asian man finally decided to glance up for two seconds to give me a disgusted look and point to the other double doors on the side of the building. He must've thought I was there to drop off mail.  I figured maybe as it nears closing time they only have those doors open. I go to the other doors and they are locked as well, but now he's far enough away to where him ignoring me does not seem unreasonable. I took advantage of the mail delivery window with the doorbell next to me, and used that to finally have an employee there speak with me. They started by abruptly saying it closes at 6 (I was now in the area of the post office that does), and the time was now around 6:18-6:20. I said I was there for my passport and that the office was closed and he was not paying attention to me. They fired back saying it takes about 20 minutes so they wouldn't be able to help. I was frustrated, so I do admit I snapped a bit and said that I was in the correct spot earlier but he didn't open the door or pay me any notice. Their last excuse was that he was having a bad day?! I ended up exclaiming that I just did not want my time to be wasted at this point and would appreciate them telling me if I at least have the correct paper work and documentation so that I could come back and take care of it. As this happened, i saw the Asian man walk back to the office to pretty much hide, I asked if i could talk to him about that to be sure, and the lady said she could help me as she does passports too. They did help with that, and I am forced to go back there to have it taken care of, but I have never been treated so rudely, and basically ignored to my face, because that person was having a "bad day" and did not want to work til the end of their shift?

Point of this post, if you can avoid royal oaks post office, do so. If you will be needing a person to person engagement, you will be taking the 50/50 chance that they are having a good or bad day, and that will determine the respect with which you receive. NOT WORTH IT!<//Review>< Response>

Submitted an on-line mail forwarding from Sacramento, CA 95815 to Carmichael, CA 95608 on 10/1/13 for period 10/3/13 to 11/7/13, no forwarded mail is being received.  After 14 days I contacted the Royal Oaks Post Office on three separate days.  I was told it would be taken care of and I  asked to be called back for confirmation and they agreed to do so.  As of this date (10/18/13) the forwarding has not been completed and no one returned a call to explain.  I am now on hold waiting (30minutes) to discuss with supervisor.   This is not the first time I have had difficulty getting this post office to complete requested actions.  A postal manager need to see what the issues are at this location.
Update 10/19/13, setting record straight... fault was at the Carmichael, CA post office NOT Royal Oaks, a sub postal employee did not handle the transfer correctly, finally receive mail today 16 days after requested forwarding.  Postal supervisor at Carmichael was helpful and followed up to get the mail in our hands, good job by Patrick, appreciate his efforts.<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Very poor service for passport. They should change the people working there. We can see that they are on purpose working slow. People are sitting and the people working there are talking and gossiping. And always they put a sign out there at 3:30 that no more applications today. Even if there are not too many people in there. They do it everyday same like that. That’s very wrong. Also they skip the token numbers and when someone ask them that there number did not came on the board and they took the number ahead of that person, people working here just make and excuse that they did it by mistake.
Government should definitely do something about this issue. People working in this department are getting salary for sitting there and gossiping.
This is very wrong and people of America are suffering due to this.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
I went to apply for a passport only to find that they will simply stop serving customers if the line is too long. I was there 1.5 hours before their scheduled close time and was turned away. There is no way of knowing when they will stop serving customers,  so I suppose you just have to arrive when they open if your schedule permits, which mine does not. When I complained to the worker, she rudely suggested that I go wait in another line to talk to a supervisor. Are you kidding me??
As an alternative, I tried scheduling an appointment at another post office and the phone number takes you to a voicemail where they ask you to leave a number and they'll get back to you to schedule the appointment. The problem is that they never get back to you.
There is no way a private company could stay in business if they offered such poor service. The post office should be privatized, as it would be doing the public a favor.<//Review>

<Review>We used the passport office to get out newborn a passport. The staff was very friendly, we didn't wait for too long. Janet was the one who helped us with our application. She was very nice and quick.<//Review>< userid>

<Text>I came here on a Tuesday morning. Parking lot holds about 20 cars. 2 hour street parking. Mind you, limited parking for both doing business at the post office and passport office. Signs infront of the post office directs you towards the side towards the passport office. No public restrooms. Hours are actually 1030 - 1830 Mon - Sat. They do a ticket system. Plenty of chairs. All relevant infomation is on a table to the left as you enter. Employees seem too busy to help you personally. Waited from 1020, finished by 1130. I was number 4 in line. I saw 10 people waiting as I was leaving. Two employees for the whole 8 hours. I'd imagine fatigue and irritability gets to them as the day goes on. The guy seemed hating life. The gal was pleasant enough. Had everything ready: DS-11, birth certificate, ID. They photocopy your documents for you. They take your picture for an extra $15, and actually give you the extra headshot. They take cash, check, and debit. They only do DS-11 for passport applications. The actual process takes 10 minutes. The extra 30 - 60 minutes comes from waiting in line. I'd imagine everything becomes hell later in the day, but I can only give my impression from 1030 - 1130: not a terrible experience if you're there before lunch.<//Text><date>1495595203035</date></record></dataset><record>

<review>There new mail carrier is hella lazy.  I have a shop down the street from the post office and the carrier drops all of the my neighboring mail at the first shop.  So my neighbor has to pass out our mail.  The carrier doesn't even check if we have mail going out,  he just jumps back in his vehicle and takes off.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>They changed our mailbox without informing us, they don't bother to ring our door to deliver the new key or mail.  Old key no longer works, and mail is sitting in the box without access.  W2/Checks being held up by USPS is messing with our livelihood, they could care less.  Without money, no food.  I hope this mail carrier starves for a few days< /Review>< pictures>

I avoid this place like the plague.  I had a couple of packages which were lost.  I came to pick them up and they cannot find them.  Not a good use of my time + it is a hike from my house. I no longer go there.  If the package is there, I just go online and tell them to "return to sender" and find a vendor who does not use USPS.  I hit amazon, ebay or whoever back and tell them that i need a refund on the item.  Even they know USPS has horrible service problems. I get a refund every time ! UPS and Fedex provide much better package services with more options for pickup or redelivery.  They actually answer the phone !<//review>

If I could give this post office 0 stars, I would. USPS lost my package. The tracking number said it was delivered to the parcel locker to the mail box near my house. I never received the key to the parcel locker so I went to this post office to request the key. I went there 4 times in 2 weeks for help. No one cared to help me. I had 2 supervisors tell me they would call me to follow up, they never did. I had to wait in my car for 2 and a half hours for the mail man to open up the parcel lockers to get a freaking answer. USPS lost my package that I waited 2 weeks to see what the hell happened to it. If you can't get access to your parcel or it says its delivered and you didnt get it. File a claim. Don't even bother wasting your time on anyone at this post office. They will only say what you want to hear and not do anything about it. This is the worst post office ever.<//Text>

<review>Currently leaving the office without a receipt! The lady Janet was rude and impatient as if she didn't know that people would like to obtain passports for their kids she tried maybe like 3times to get my son's picture then said we would have to get it somewhere else. Out of those trys she had one good shot and missed it so it was not entirely my son's fault! I asked if she had a survey I can fill out and she answered with its on your receipt I told her I didn't have one because we didn't go through the prosses. She pointed out the door and said there's supervisors out there if you want to complain.  She was rude from the start. I'm a very positive and friendly person but this lady just ticked me off, off of how rude she was.<//review>< Pictures>

DWB.  Driving while brown or dumb white bi***.  Yup that old lady seems pretty darn racist.  That or she really hates to see interracial couples since my brother came in with his girlfriend.  She wouldn't take my credit card because my license signature didn't completely match the signature I put on the pad.  Obviously, my ID name matches my credit card!  Why would we use a stolen credit card to send a $5 package?  Also that old white man threw my change into my hands when I paid cash.  Wow!</text>

Absolutely horrific! Their customer service gets the lowest rating possible! They are rude and completely unwilling to be helpful. A package was sent to this location from amazon that I needed as soon as possible. I paid for express shipping. it was sent to this location and never sent out to be delivered. I called the next day and was told it was there and could be picked up. I went to pick up the package and the rude girl in the window told me they did not have it. I asked to speak to a supervisor who told me she called a different location and my package was there. I thanked her and went to the other location. When I got there, they told me they did not have it and it was at the original location I was at. I called customer service to get an answer and was sent back to Royal Oaks. The people at the front counter still said they did not know and were rude and unwilling to help. I am unbelievably upset with this horrible service. None of those people deserve to be working there.</Text>

The management of this USPS site is not good at all, specially the lady whom is the manager, she is very rude to all people she accused a person of stealing a tape but the person showed her his used tape which had the sold stump on it which means he paid for it. I always use USPS for almost all of my mailing and shipping, but this kind of behavior makes people unhappy and dissatisfied, I wrote this comment to let the top management to know about the poor performance of this site manager.< /review>

Went to royal oaks post office today before 3pm and there were no numbers out about five familys waiting two more familys came behind me and we were all turned down and and was told they have a maximum amount of 20- to 25 people per day that they can process now yes its first come first serve at the same time the website and signs around the building says 10:00am to 3:00pm nothing about 20 to 25 people very disappointed in the non service I recieved today I think you need to reevaluate your services and website clearly to say that you can only process 25 application a day thank you for every thing you did not do</review>

I walked up both doors open at 5:57 pm 2 people in Line & she yells where CLOSED! So I go to passport office which closes at 6:30, there’s 1 last filling out application not to mention my app is filled out & the old man at the first desk says where closed cause I'm by myself. All I could do was say ok & smh cause I know for sure it only takes 13 minutes to a passport. This office needs a course on customer service!< /review>

I drive across town to get here. I arrived two minutes before closing, the door to the service desk was already locked and the self service counter was not functioning.

I'm sticking with FedEx & UPS.<//Text>

<text>Had a package stuck in "missent/rerouting" hell for a week as it made circles between two post offices. Called the USPS, they said they'd investigate and get back to me.

2 days later, "Sammy" from the Royal Oaks Post Office calls to give me some news. Tells me to call him back - I call the number (the same one listed for this post office) and it rings, and rings, and rings ... 75 rings later, the phone company cuts off the call, as they do. No answering machine, no answer, nothing.

Then I try the two other numbers I can find for this same post office (one is the number caller ID lists the call came from). Same thing.

Finally, on my fifth call to the first number, someone picks up after 32 rings. And then promptly says "goddamn" and hangs up the phone on me before I can say anything.

They call me back the next day again, and rudely tell me "you were really hard to get ahold of." Really? Try answering your phone.

Not a friendly office - and they're not fulfilling their responsibilities to the parent organization, who now after my letter to the USPS OIG has to investigate why a staffer is giving out a number that they have no interest in answering.

I am a big fan of the USPS, but the staff of this post office give that organization a bad name.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Extremely bad customer service. Even 1 star  too generous of a rating for this post office. Very rude & obnoxious. AVOID the guy with the first initial "F". He lacks social skills.< /Text>

<Review>Arrive to ship packages and their lobby is closed from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm due to past vandalism.  Seriously?  How about hiring a security guard during business hours if it is that bad?  Instead, they penalize the entire community during holiday season by closing their doors.   Ridiculous.</Review>< Pics>

Do not go to this post office to get your passport done, or you will be there for long  time. This place only has 3 employees that handle the paper work and it takes for ever. This place does not even have a bathroom so you have to walk down to the gas station. This is ridiculous worst place ever.</Text>

Poor customer service, poor mailing services.

I've been going to this DaVinci's pizza for years. Well actually my wife likes Me-N-Eds, which I think shouldn't even be called pizza. Over the years, this pizza parlor has been pretty consistent, but I had noticed less and less toppings on the pizza. Last night's pizza was loaded, no bare spots of crust, tons of cheese. It was awesome!! Really good.< /review>

Been going to DaVinci since it opened, that's a lot of pizzas.  Yesterday we had the best pizza, called Kevin and told him what a great pizza. Keep it up.< /Text>

<Text>Been getting pizza from this location for years do to it being great. But yesterday was a whole different story! The 2 large pizza's I ordered were paper thin (didn't order thin crust; wasn't asked either) and full of grease; dripping! And hardly any toppings. Looks like we will be having to find another pizza place to go to.

Note: the store Manager did call me to apologize for the quality of pizza I received and comped my order to redeem whenever I would like. I redeemed 1 and it was somewhat better but nothing like what they used to be. You would think with the horrible experience the workers would be sure to make a quality good looking pizza to be sure to keep this customer that wasn't happy. But then again that should be every item that leaves out of there. Such a shame to see that the quality has gone downhill or it's just that the employees don't care! Hope my next comped pizza is better. It will be the deciding factor if I order again.</Text>< pictures>

First time having Da Vinci’s pizza and I must say I am super impressed.  Crust and cheese very tasty.  Pizza came piping hot too.  Highly recommend.</text>

<Text>Awesome pizza!!!  Great crust and good fresh tasty toppings. However, if you order online for delivery, you MUST DOUBLE the time they say you will receive it at your home. It's usually still warm though.
They have good pick-up specials that are guaranteed to be hot.
Update - I found that if you call after ordering online to ask for estimated delivery, they will go check the machine and not miss your order and usually gets delivered in 45 minutes.</Text><rate>4< /rate><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x809442bb148acbdd:0x9b1447b79fc5ddef<//GmapID>< Name>

<user_name>jamie smith<//user_name><Text>To whom ever it concerns me and my family use to love di Vinci pizza and would regularly order from them for years but recently the first and Nees location we would order from closed so our orders where sent to willow location .  When we order our regular order first the driver forgets our sides and the ones he did bring where crushed and spilled in back but was worse is when we started eating the pizza we found hair in the pizza. This was in not just one of our Slices but all 4 of us found some . When I called to complain the gm jeff just excused us of lying when we weren’t asking for money back but order redone . For this me and my daughters will never order from them again and recommend you don’t as well Or eventually you’ll have to deal with this issue with pizza and there gm JEFF< /Text></record>

I ordered large combination pizza on the phone.Im a long time customer. I only had a large bill the young man on the phone said no problem 2 times he'd send change.Pizza came no change called store they wanted me to wait for pizza to come back again with change probably cold.I said I can't go to the store for change just had 2 knee surgeries. I try to place orders since they hang up on me every time why is this my fault and are the owners ok with this type of treatment of their customers ?</Text>

This pizza is delicious, I’m very happy that the pizza isn’t mostly bread , I can taste the sauces and spices and the cheese is great
The ranch is tasty

I think if davincis expanded, other pizza places would be in trouble ^.^<//review>< Rate>

The lady on the phone forgot our children's pizza on our order even tho she repeated it back to us. When we called the manager she was very rude and unwilling to help resolve this. It's one thing to mess up an order but to be rude to someone who lives near by and orders all the time is unacceptable. We will be eating pizza from me-n-eds from now on.<//Review>

5 Diamond Mechanical was excellent. I live in a high rise and the AC unit was custom designed and built for my building. I called 5 Diamond Mechanical and they were able to send a technician the same day. The technician was very professional, he ran diagnostics on my AC unit and was able to give me options on how to proceed. I knew that what I really needed was a new AC unit since mine was 19 years old. They were able to get one of the custom AC units from the manufacturer, since other homeowners were also replacing their units and the manufacturer makes these in batches. In just a couple of days 5 Diamond Mechanical installed my new unit. They even installed a complementary Nest thermostat. I am very happy with their service and I will definitely recommend them to my neighbors who may need to replace their units. I will also be using their services again in the future for the maintenance of my unit.</text>

Found 5 Diamond Mechanical on yelp. They responded minutes within my inquiry and they were available for next day service even though I put flexible timing, which is awesome! Additionally they gave me the cost up front. They game me a 2 hour window in which the tech would be here, but they had constant communication and let me know ahead of time when the tech was heading my way which I really appreciate. Robert was really nice and courteous and gave me details of their Diamond program and the benefits without being pushy. He explained what he was doing and what he found and what is normal. Will definitely use them again and would recommend them.</Text>

<Review>Top notch service!  5 Diamond was the second HVAC company to come to my home to evaluate my furnace.  Wes and team arrived to my home on time, were completely professional, polite and explained what the problem was with my furnace, options on how to repair/replace and I am actually looking forward to the proposal for my replacement.  Most importantly, I understand why my furnace needs replacing and fully agree.
There appearance, respect for the cleanliness (meticulous) and safety of my home was far above any other vendor I have worked with.  They even brought their own entry mat to my front door!< /Review>< date>

Wouldn't you know that when we least expected it, our AC unit died a couple of days ago during a heat wave in San Diego. I called a few competitors, but no one was willing or able to schedule an appointment to service our unit for 2-3 weeks! That was until I called 5-Diamond Heating and Cooling.

They went out of their way to fit us into their schedule ASAP. 2-days later a team arrives on-time and got right to work. The tech immediately identified the problem (a faulty capacitor) and proceeded to replace and test the new capacitor. He even inspected every inch of the AC unit to ensure that there wasn't anything else outstanding. He took the time to educate me on all the major components and how to properly maintain it to extend the life of the unit. He put everything back in it's place, ran some final tests and then we said our goodbyes. When it was all said and done, the end-to-end process took less than an hour. We can finally breath again... literally and figuratively speaking.

5 Diamond's team was extremely professional, empathetic and knowledgeable. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. If you're on the fence about who to hire to repair your AC unit, then look no further. The name 5 Diamond says it all...<//Text>

<text>Finding someone you can trust to repair anything in your unit when you live in a high rise building in downtown San Diego is a hard task. Most companies it seems will give you ridiculously high rates because they think you can afford it. I was lucky to be referred to 5 Diamond by my building manager. Brent and Justin arrived 10 minutes before our appointment window. They were extremely professional and knowledgeable. They articulated the problem they found, fixed it and gave me feedback that will hopefully prevent me from seeing them more often. I am happy to know that in the future I can count on 5 Diamond with any future repairs and I will recommend them to my friends and family. Thank you!<//text><rating>5< /rating>< GmapID>

<review>5 Diamond Mechanical was referred to me through my real estate agent. The first thing he told me was that 5 Diamond had exceptional service and a high quality installation process. As I sit at my computer the day after installation was completed, I can confidently say he was absolutely right. I first spoke with Carlos Martinez, co-owner of 5 Diamond, on the phone regarding what system would fit my home. He was incredibly knowledgeable and genuinely easy to talk to. Moving into a new home presents a lot of challenges and Carlos was always responsive and flexible with my crazy hours. Once it came time for installation, there was an initial hiccup regarding placement of the condenser. Once I expressed my displeasure, Carlos and his team worked tirelessly to meet my desires and "knock it out of the park" for me. On day 2 of installation, I met Nick Mullins, the other co-owner of 5 Diamond, as well as his coworker Justin McDonald. These guys had the work ethic of 10 people combined and the knowledge to back it up. They were on time, cordial, and extremely good at their jobs. They took time to walk me through the installation process and make sure they were meeting my expectations. On the final day of installation, they stayed until almost 8 pm to complete the install and walk me through the system and maintenance. 5 Diamond prides themselves on making customers part of their family, and that is absolutely how I felt. I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone. Great job guys!</review><rate>5</rate>< response>

The AC at our office started blowing hot air in the midst of a heat wave! Our office staff had to work from home because it was so hot and even spiked up to 93 degrees! Thankfully, 5 Diamond was able to come and fix it the following day. Debbie in the office was very kind in setting up an appointment and Brent and his partner came to the rescue by fixing our AC. Very kind people and great experience overall. Highly recommend!< /Text>

Robert and Donovan arrived on-time, masks and booties on. Put down a little carpeting at the front door so that no dirt came in. Cleaned up after themselves and wiped down the walls so there were no fingerprints.  They were totally professional. I will only use 5 Diamonds in the future.<//Review>

<Review>I noticed a water leak coming from my A/C, and after doing some investigating to find the cause I reached out to my HOA for advice on how to proceed.  My property manager shared my issue with 5 Diamond Mechanical, who promptly called me back to set up an appointment.  I spoke to Wes at 5 Diamond on the phone, who was very helpful and had all of the details of my issue at hand - he walked through the issue, spoke with me for some time about the issues I was seeing, then set up an appointment.
Nick came out to look at my A/C unit in person, and he was just as great to work with.  Having worked in my building in the past, he was knowledgeable about my A/C unit and was able to quickly walk through the issue with me again.  Before starting any work, he laid out my options and did not pressure me into any work or purchases that I wasn't ready for.
All said, 5 Diamond Mechanical was a pleasure to work with, and I'll be reaching out to them first with any A/C problems in the future.< /Review>< time>

<Text>Inquired about duct installation from our microwave exhaust fan to the outside roof vent and 5 Diamond completed the job quickly thereafter.

< Review>
I can't believe we've found a professional, polite, clean, responsive and fairly priced HVAC maintenance and installation company.  We've been through quite a few in the last 50 (yes, okay) years. This is the best we've ever found, and I won't use anyone else.

Just had our HVAC system serviced (annual scheduled maintenance). Since we organize with neighbors, we get a great rate since they only have to come out ONCE for a whole bunch of people. They arrive in professional-looking clothing, explain everything they are doing - even take photos of stuff up in the "attic" space so I can see what they're doing without climbing up there. Then they clean up every spot and speck so I have nothing to do after they leave.

I don't think I'll do my obsessive "price research" ever again - I've found my "forever company."<//Review>

Young technician was very nice and did come back to my house after unfortunately not hearing him the first time.  He said after going into my attic and checking out my air conditioner that the problem was the thermostat.  He then tried to sell us one for $370 and I said no.  Then he offered me one for $140.  I then said ok change it, which he proceeded to do.  After he changed the thermostat, he said that it still didn't work because of the mother board.  He said it would be $800 after all of this I said no I do not want to invest into an older unit.  I asked the price on a new system and he said it would be $7500-$9500.  At that point he said he was sorry and he would need to order the mother board.  Then he proceeded to charge me $229.  $140 for the thermostat and $89.00 for the diagnosis fee.  He did not diagnose the problem and changing the thermostat did not fix my AC.  I had Alberto from Ocean Heating & Air Conditioning.  He was here for 30 minutes and said the furnace was unplugged and that all we needed was Freon.  He charged me a total of $150 and my AC is now working.

I spoke to 5 Diamond Mechanical's manager and explained that I did not understand why I was charged to replace a thermostat and charged for a diagnosis I did not receive.  He did offer to send someone back on Monday to replace my thermostat and reimburse my fees.  I will update my review when and if this happens.</review>

I had an issue with mice in my vents and 5 Diamond helped get everything fixed as soon as possible. The tech, Robert, who came out originally was very helpful and explained what needed to be done. He worked with me on the price to reduce the costs a bit since it was a fairly large amount of money I had to unexpectedly spend over the holidays. I would definitely recommend this company to others looking for honest and reliable HVAC support.</Text>

<review>We had 5 Diamond install AC in our 1927 North Park house and we couldn't be happier. We had them come out and give us a quote in the June time-frame so right before their busy season. We got a quote that was below what we had expected and they fit us in immediately.

They ended up replacing a super old furnace, installing central AC and some ducting downstairs then did 3 mini-splits in our upstairs. The system works flawlessly and we couldn't be happier.

Nick and his guys were the epitome of customer service specialists. They were super responsive and went above and beyond to ensure that we were satisfied with the project. They did great work in a compressed timeline and I recommend them to anyone looking into getting an HVAC job done on their house. I forgot to mention that there were other companies that I had come out and give me a quote and a few downright wouldn't take the job since the house is so old and funky.

Definitely plan on using Nick, Carlos and their guys again in the future. Highly recommend them to anyone.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80d955692398b74b:0x84b0f73d83735ca9<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Carlos is exceptional at customer service, he is available via text and makes the process as seamless as possible. As a customer it is easier to work with the owner directly and it makes a difference when the owner is as pleasant and easy to reach as he is.
Additionally I respect the way the quotes are produced as they are completely broken down so you know what you are being charged. Many companies lump everything but this system is much more upfront. I would recommend working with 5 Diamond and especially with Carlos.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Not the best experience.  I had trouble with my A/C upstairs system.  I called Nest and they walked me through many scenarios on troubleshooting the issue.  Finally, they said "we will have a technician come out to your home to look at the issue AND if the thermostat IS the issue we will replace it to you for FREE."  The technicians arrived on time and were very courteous and professional.  They installed a common wire and thought the issue was resolved.  15 min. after they left we had the same issue.  The owner, Nick, came out that afternoon to help (that was impressive and so is Nick).  BUT, we still had issues.  Nick determined that our system was working fine, but the thermostat must be bad.  he spent a lot of time testing the system.  I had kept Nest's email and work order and contacted them.  They said that Nick's company (5 Diamond Heating and Cooling) needed to contact them directly, not me.  I called Nick the next day to let him know.  While Nick was at my home he inspected my ductwork in the attic and gave me an estimate on repairing some torn ducts that needed to be replaced etc.  I appreciated that.  I followed up with Nick today (a week later) to find out about the thermostat and when to expect it.  I followed up with Nick....he SHOULD have followed up with me.  It was a week later and I had heard nothing. That's the issue that gets me.  He had dropped the ball.  He said that Nest would NOT be replacing the thermostat, something totally different than I was told in the beginning by Nest.  Shame on Nest, but Nick's company could have been pro-active and just offered to put one in on them and I would have hired them for the other job.  Take care of your customer, no matter what it takes....a $150 thermostat!  Really?  In good conscience I can't recommend them to other homeowners.  If I took this much time to post a review, do you believe me?  I realize that Nest should have stood behind their promise and that is disappointing so not all of the blame should go to 5 Diamond Heating & Cooling.  But, they didn't follow up with me either, so that is why I won't hire them for future work and I live on a private road of 20 homes and will let my neighbors know my experience.  Both Nick and Carlos did follow up with me after my initial review and that was impressive, but Nick asked me to change it.  Sorry, I have to tell it like it is.  I won't lie just to give a perfect rating.  I DID change from a 1 star to a 3 star after considering that Nest really dropped the ball, but so did their company too.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80d955692398b74b:0x84b0f73d83735ca9</Gmap_id><username>Dan Linge<//username></record></dataset><record>

<date>1574451084400< /date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Wow!!! This was my first interaction with the team at 5 Diamond. My hot water heater broke down. Let's just say I was feeling direct & immediate pressure from my wife & daughter to find a qualified HVAC tech to fix it ASAP. I was drawn to the company from the high ratings on Yelp and I was not disappointed. The company was very responsive to my initial request on Yelp... < 10 mins to respond. They were able to mobilize a professional and courteous technician (Wes) to my home in under 2 hours. Wes was able to trouble shoot and resolve the problem in 45 mins and the cost of repair was very reasonable. I was super impressed by the end-to-end care.

<Review>These guys are awesome. I had an appointment scheduled out a week in advance but an emergency left me in a tight spot. Carlos was wonderful over the phone and worked extremely hard to get me a same day appointment (!!!!). Within an hour, I had Brent and Shelby at my house. They were able to find the problem and correct it within an hour. They even took the extra step to show me what was wrong and took precaution to protect my flooring. They then helped me reinstall the nest which included anchors and drilling which was a HUGE help. I highly recommend them—very quick, very honest, thorough and straight forward company. Thanks again!!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1589924384928, 'text': 'Hello Breanne thank you for the 5 stars and the nice words!

Truly outstanding service. They checked our 3 airconditioners and furnaces  and pronounced them in good shape. Their only recommendation was to change out two capacitors.
This was after we had an evaluation by a different company who said all units should be changed because they were nearing the end of their life.
Honesty is a rare virtue these days and it is comforting to find a company that isn't out to just sell equipement.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This place is so much more than amazing food, it's an experience in excellence. I haven't experienced service like this in a very long time.  My husband and I each ordered a glass of wine, but once I tasted his, I didn't want mine. The waiter noticed I was sipping on my husband's glass and he brought me a glass of what he was having. I was impressed at the waiter's level of attention. We mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary and to my surprise we were given top notch wine and a cake to celebrate. The wine, the cake, and the 1st glass of wine that I didn't care for were not on our bill. Not to mention that the food was phenomenal! It's one thong to have an amazing menu, but it's quite another thing to have such an excellent staff. Needless to say, this place is our new favorite.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The food and service at Valenti are wonderful, whether taking out or eating inside (in the good old days). The pasta is always awesome, the fish perfectly prepared and our favorite chocolate tower is decadent without being heavy. The service is friendly, competent and welcoming. Perfect for a special occasion or a weekly treat.< /Text>

If you’re impressed by the menu offerings you won’t be disappointed! And surprisingly this gem has been operating inside the San Anselmo Inn for years! Far more creative than the usual Italian fare, everything we had was impeccably prepared, deeply flavorful without being heavy. The polenta fries were so airy/crispy whereas the sheep’s ricotta cavatelli was like the older luxurious cousin to tortellini with prosciutto and peas. But the sea bass with spinach and lemon... divine and flakey. Topped off with the three layer chocolate “love” it was an outstanding meal. I’ll be back.</Review>

<Text>I'm a man of many words, but in this rare instance, it's hard describe the feeling of being transported to Italy here in Marin for a night. Wow. The food is so clean and pure and representative of Italy its hard to walk out hours later after taking in the full food and wine experience. Graci!!!<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

This was my first time trying this restaurant and I was blown away. From the moment we arrived, our waiter greeted us at the door and provided impeccable service through to dessert. He was incredibly attentive, yet gave us space to talk, take our time, and enjoy our meal.  When we had questions about the menu, he was clearly knowledgable about the menu,  the ingredients, and the method of preparation.  The salads and pastas that we ordered were flavorful and spot on delicious. The people that work at this restaurant from the chef, to the bussing staff, to our amazing waiter clearly care about what they do and do it with incredible professionalism and artistry.< /review>

<review>I do not longer need to fly to Italy to get an great  Italian food experience. Valenti & Co. comes up with my expectations all the times. I am native from Piemonte and I feel like at home at Valenti & Co.
It' s all about ingredients that chef Valenti turns into elegant and tasteful courses. The Staff is competent  and Wine List is great!....I definitely suggest to try it.....</review><user_id>106361579708794070523</user_id>< GmapID>

We had the heirloom tomato salad( which was in season) the fettuccine with scallops and pancetta, (pasta is home made) and the polenta fries. We finished off with creamy Cappuccinos. We also had a couple glasses of wine.

< Review>
I returned a few months later, and had to amend my review below. The food and service (from the chef himself) were outstanding.

Open until 10 pm hugely misleading. Called at 9:20 to ask if an order could be placed in 5 minutes, told no, kitchen already closed. Arrived at San Anselmo Inn at 9:25 went to room to put away work bag, decided to have a cocktail before picking up dinner across the street at 9:40 (a place willing to accommodate despite listed as closed at 9:30) and the response -- at 9:30 at Valenti  -- was that the bar was closed. The owner grudgingly said he would pour beer or wine but there was no way I was going to inconvenience him with my money. I walked out and enjoyed a great salad and Pinot Noir at the other restaurant that "officially" closed at 9:30.</Review>

The selection of products is often not as wide as I would like, both in types of products I would like to buy and in the brand selection available. However the staff is generally polite and friendly, and fairly patient with the idiosyncrasies of their guests. I often check their specials when I go in and find good discounts occasionally.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< review>
out of all the stores around "winco, food 4 less, food max, several meat markets even, and even save mart... this store is ridiculous. the store I go to on a regular basis is located in Ripon California. 1201 W main st. sometimes the prices are decent but I was shocked to see that during covid, the price for ground beef went up from 9 dollars to 18 dollars for a roll. now, save mart is the most expensive place i go there seldomly as the prices are high, but even save mart, does not have 18 dollar ground beef for what use to be 9 dollars. and the only response i could get from anyone in the store was that because of covid there is a shortage on product and so they had to raise the prices... OK well, winco, food 4 less, food max, and save mart Costco... several meat markets... all sell beef at the same price not 18 dollars... but around 9 for that same amount. if supply is so low... why didn't it go up anywhere else except here at dollar general? this is completely absurd there is no excuse for this, out of all times to raise prices, dollar general decides to do it during a nation wide crisis to raise the prices. take advantage of all those people durring this crisis by jacking up the prices. I wont be back. this is outrageous.  I can just imagine the newspapers front page title "local dollar general located in Ripon, rips off customers during nation wide crisis by doubling the cost of food" I'll be taking my money to savemart, they have cheaper beef. also unrelated to the beef cost at this location, I also noticed a review from a customer saying the place is filthy, and not well maintained pretty much, I'd like to add to that review, the pee toilet doesn't flush and hasn't in a while, they never put soap in the dispenser and the restrooms are dirty.</review>

I was there this evening looking for something that I could find and a  employee named Rebecca and she was so helpful and made my shopping there easier.  And she made my girlfriend smile. She was very professional and helpful.  Kind and seemed to really know her job.  I give your store five stars because that girl made it go fast and friendly. Don't know what her regular work habits are but if she is that good all the time id recommend you promote her .< /Text>

The prices, cleanliness and customer service attitudes are great.
However, the amount of cashier's on hand is too low. There is never enough and the wait time in line is too long. I feel for the workers because they are over extended.
NEED MORE CASHIERS during weekday hours!< /Review>

< Review>
It's not your ordinary Dollar General store, it has fresh meats, fruits and veggies, sweets,beverages, and a huge frozen food section(my favorite:one pound of frozen berries for just over $2). Good management too, if you ask for help, they are quick to respond.</Review>

I got banned for a year out of this place because I complain about their meat...
. Everything else is a bargain but don't buy the meat except for the ground beef cuz that goes so quickly anything else you're going to be returning because it's going to be spoiled by the time you want to use it< /text>

(Translated by Google) I love that there are markets in the neighborhood where you can buy them cheaply.
The stuff is cheap... well... it's not something that can be used for a long time, but it's worth going as soon as you're in a hurry.

동네에 저렴하게 구입할 수 있는 마켓이 있다는게 너무 좋다.
물건도 싸고..뭐..오래 쓸만한 것들은 아니지만 급한대로, 아쉬운대로 갈만하다.< /Text>

I went for a free upgrade. At the same time I asked them to figure out once and for all what was wrong with my liftgate. They determined that it was sensors that they had to order. It took two days, but if it keeps working it was worth it. They also did a maintenance check and determined a couple of problems that I had them perform. One thing that I like is that they assign one service advisor who works with the customer from start to finish. Mine was Randy, and he did a great job of keeping me informed. 👍🏼</text>

<text>The service agents are friendly and honest. I took my car for a break chance because I knew it was at the service milage. Before the brake change the crew looked at both and front and recommend to only change the rear since the front still had some life.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>I thought this dealership was doing so well after being at so many other ones in California and I have now had several problems with a repair they did on my car in now they lack my trust in there ability to do any of the services they did on my vehicle properly.

The help they provided was telling me to go to my new dealership and tell them that it wasn't their fault that this clip wasnt put on correctly but that I just saw it popped up in the position that it was so they told me to lie to the dealership that they had messed up in the 1st place. I have now moved out of state and have to deal with the another dealership but the fact that another problem has arisen (a crack in a brand new seal windshield seal) with my most recent repair is very worrisome about their ability to provide the service they should be giving</Review>< Pics>

I went in for the recall on my fuel pump, Mike was very obliging he explained to me that it would take up to five hours and that I would be able to get a loaner car he also pointed out that I had some free services coming on my warranties. I would recommend this service department to anyone who owns a Subaru they are wonderful. Mike called me when my car was done, it was sooner than 4 hours I was glad to find out, and I was in and out with it in no time.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Been having my 16' wrx matenanced here for years always great work done. They do tend to take a while on big jobs. I waited about 2 weeks for a chutch. They usually give a 10$ (taxi) voucher when u drop your vehicle off which is really nice.  I use that voucher every time. They will not notice any type of engine light of any other issues of you're vehicle beside whatever is due by milage which can be very irritating. They have even tried to sell me maintenance I've already had done, so be careful with that. Make sure you tell them to check your fluids and any weird issues. Even ask after they finish you're vehicle because they will forget. They won't touch your tires if you have aftermarket rims so keep that in mind. Yes even with a key they won't touch them. There customer service is always polite and helpful. I definitely recommend them.</text>< Pics>

Mike was very professional, Attentive and Patient. He kept the line of communication open.
Unfortunately a loss of a key without a spare did create unexpected expense and grief beyond that I expected but the Service was superb. Thank you Mike for making misfortune to an a easier experience. Franchesca<//text>

Waited in driveway for 10 minutes before anyone came out. We did another 10 minutes for a service writer to not show up. Left without oil change. So much for express service.< /Review>

I paid my car off a year and a half early and I needed assistance to cancel my GAP insurance on my vehicle. I spoke to a lady name LINDA DOHERTY and she sent me the paper to fill out and send back to her because I moved out of state. 3 months has went by and I haven't heard anything back from her. I have called multiple times to get an update on my GAP insurance reimbursement check and to see if they have received the information because I haven't heard anything and the service and sales desk will give me misinformation such as one person will tell me that Linda Doherty is not in that day and when I call again same day another person will tell me that she just ran past them and they can only take a message. I am tired of leaving messages and I have been leaving messages with them for 3 months. All I want is someone to process the paperwork I submitted and get my GAP Insurance reimbursement check. That is not hard to ask. I've even called to talk to the General Manager and I haven't received a call from him either. I will never shop here again and unless this matter gets fixed immediately, I will take this matter higher to my lawyer because this is not how you treat your customers.<//text>

Upon speaking to a really friendly sales rep, he informed me that my car needed a recall as well to which I agreed would be worked on. Fast forward a few days later the same friendly sales rep calls to tell me my car is ready for pick up and finished being repaired. Upon test driving and inspection I noticed my transmission now rattles in first and second gear as well as when turning, which it never did prior to getting it “repaired and serviced”. And my front bumper cover was installed improperly and the front clips are bent and cracked beyond repair. Friendly staff, but terrible service.</review>< pics>

Make sure your salesman or the finance group is in detail when they talk ask you if you guys want to buy the EQUITY SHEILD PROTECTION PLAN. THEY WILL JUST SAY THAT IF YOU GOT DENT/DINV ON THE CAR AS LONG AS IT’S SMALLER THAN A BASEBALL BALL THEN IT’S fIXABLE AND THEY WILL FIX IT FOR FREE BUT THEY DIDN’T SPECIFY THAT IF YOU A SHARP DENT, THEY WILL NOT FIX IT CAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE “CONTRACT” SAYS. They will not say it up front cause they want to take your money. Just a heads up. I know I should have read the contract itself but I trusted them and this happened.   Hope this serve as a lesson for the future buyers.<//Text>

Bad experience twice. They didnt want to honor my paid warranty or give me a loaner car the first time I ever went for service . I had to fight for it. Second time went to fix my A/C and they told me I had a broken head gasket and was quoted 4500k +. Took it to a regular mechanic and of course that wasn’t the case. Really disappointed especially during the this time with the virus. Stay Away!!</Review>

<Text>I ordered front and rear brake pads for my 2014 outback. The whole process was painless! I received up to date updates as my order was processed, shipped and delivered. I received my order the following day although they stated it may take a few days to fulfill and ship my order. Will definitely order from them again whenever I need to replace anything. I have the piece of mind knowing that I'm replacing with genuine subaru parts and I can't complain about the turn around time. Having 2 kids and working 60+ hours a week makes it difficult to accomplish tasks like this and I was pleasantly surprised at the experience I had.<//Text></record>

If I could I would give it a negative ratting.  Talk about bait and switch.  Waste of my time. Basically lied to several times. Asked for a quote and break down on a price we agreed upon. Kiel and his manger gave me the run around. They tried to up sell on coverages, warranties, and other packages they didn't know about or have the paperwork on. "I didn't get it on my Subaru but you should.<//text>

I needed a small part for my car. Puente Hills Subaru had the BEST price in the country - I looked at a lot of places that carried the part. I was surprised to receive my part the next day! I would definitely buy from them again. Keep up the great work!< /Text>

Brandon was professional and at my house in a timely manner.  He was knowledgeable in what the issue was and how to fix it.  He gave me excellent advice on how to prevent this from happening again. It was a pleasure to have him at my house and would be grateful for him to return any time I needed further assistance from his company.<//Text>

<Text>This was a holiday weekend disaster. Sewer clogged, all the toilets in house backed up and toilet water backing up into shower and tub drains. Technician was at the house within 40 minutes of calling.  He was thorough, professional and did an amazing job cleaning out the clogged pipes. Holiday weekend continued flowing smoothly. Very pleased.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Woke up to flooding in my kitchen last night.  I turned off water to house cleaned up the mess and called for repairs this morning.  By noon my kitchen was back to working order and I couldn’t be happier with the customer service, the technician or the results.  What I especially favored was how Christopher explained everything so well that I understood what had happened and why.  He went out of his way to ensure that he knew about the history of the plumbing in my older double wide mobile and that I was educated on the historical recall situation of the pipe my home has.  He clearly explained the options and wanted me to understand what was involved.  He made a couple of calls to search for any other possible alternatives using speakerphone each time. He made a short run for parts and explained what he needed and why they didn’t carry it on the truck.  The actual time it took him for the repair was short and he had me inspect the work and wanted me to be aware of how to turn off the valve just in case anything might happen in the future.  Many thanks for kindness to an old woman, his tidiness in my kitchen and how respectful he was.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Telephone operator was friendly.  Very positive about being able to dispatch a plumber on a Sunday afternoon.  Text updates on status of call were nice.  Trey was very professional and looked into situation right away.  Worked hard to solve the problem and I would say he went above and beyond what I expected.  Price was as quoted so no surprises.  All in all very happy with experience.< /text><Rating>5</Rating><time>1620007635461< /time><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

They came and provided a general estimate without opening anything up to actually know what the issue is.  Seems like the supervisor guy just guessed on what the problem he thinks is. The estimate was $500.

I have scheduled an appointment with someone else to come by and provide an estimate. I can update this review once that happens and what I actually end up paying for resolving the problem.

I was not happy with roto rooter. Be reasonable.

Update: I got it done for $150/labor+ $50/part today from a local plumber. Will never call Roto Rooter again.</Text>

The personal service and professionalism were awesome. I do feel that the service is double the price it should be. The sticker shock was unbelievable and should be brought up while scheduling.
The gentleman that came out was very kind considerate and very pleasant to deal with as was the lady on the phone.</text>

<text>When I called the lady on the phone was very empathetic and immediately assured me that a technician would be at the house within a short time. The technician was very professional, attentive, and explained the steps he was taking to resolve the problem.

I told them that I can’t afford that much money that’s a lot of money. So anyway I went on Amazon and bought 100 ft  sewer jetter drain cleaner hose for $80.00 to use with my gas pressure washer and I did clean myself and everything got cleaned so well I was amazed and also did save a lot of money!

I called for a property owner that had a rentals toilet that had been down 3 days already.
They were booked but offered to move customers around in order to schedule us . Easter weekend at 8 pm. Everyone ~from tech that showed up on time at job to dispatch was super friendly nice and accommodating . They offer free quotes for any job and couldn't ask for better customer service .

< review>
When scheduling the installation of a kitchen faucet (I supplied the new faucet), I asked what the estimated charge would be.  Customer service said they didn’t know but the technician would tell me.  Technician arrived and said standard (if standard why didn’t customer service give me the estimate?) installation charge is $250. Last time I used Roto Rooter, technician worked on dishwasher and charge was $69 for approximately one hour.  The faucet install took approximately one hour also.  $250 charge seemed arbitrary and unreasonably high. I think I’ll look for different plumber next time.  Service was good but price very unsatisfactory.</review>

The toilet overflowed. I cleaned up tge water and debri. Called for service. Chris and Marcos arrived to determine parts of the toilet were bad causing the back up. Xhris replaced the toilet checking the drainage first to see it was fairly clean. Main problem was the toilet itself. I was glad I decided to have it replaced. Chris was professional explaining the process and showed me the picture of the line. He did find a piece of toilet paper attached to the side if the pipe that would have caused a problem later so he cleaned it out. He was great.</Text>

Our first experience was with Jacob F and that went very well he didn’t pressure us on anything and with me that works. Jacob had another employee come over with the camera and at that point we could see the problem. The work had to be done and all went well. Two other employees came with the items needed to repair the pipeline and all went well. Thank you to all of you for your help and making it all go so well.< /Review>

I made the appt on line late in the evening, requesting time frame of 8 AM to 12 PM.  They were here promptly at 8:05.  Cleaned the drain out 50 feet and very large charge for short time of work.  When questioned, stated that was the normal charge.  Call to head office stated they could give me a "senior discount".  When I questioned the repairman why that wasn't offered, he stated that he would have had to call the office to get approval.    He also stated that my statement would be posted via email with a 6 month warranty.  I have not received that email yet 3 days later.< /review>

Then I had a scheduled appointment for someone to come and no one came and I had to call to find out they rescheduled.  The next day someone came and just to tell me that someone else needed to come. Finally the right person came late in the day did what they had to do. I had another scheduled appointment to have someone come to check and evaluate my pipes and no one showed up. Very unhappy. Only the first guy came on time and and did what he needed to do. Still need an evaluation on my pipes.<//review><Rate>2< /Rate>< user_name>

Our technician was perfectly fine. He consulted with his superiors and tried to unclog some of our lawn drains. Unfortunately roots had grown through them anr they were blocked. He charged us $300 but did not accomplish anything. Unfortunately he blew two circuit breakers in the process.  One of the had to be replaced for an additional cost of $245. So it was $545 for nothing. I will not be calling you again.</text>

< review>
Stephen came to clear clog(s) in my main pipe. He used a 150 ft snake in pouring rain. He was unable to clear it and told me I needed to PO call someone else; that "maybe they can do better than I did." He was very apologetic and seemed new and unsure of "drainage" pipe" clogs. He left, but forgot his shovel and the hand probe he used to locate the main pipe's cap. Please let him know and I will call you. Stephen was very polite, respectful, hard-working, and very sorry. Thank you for all you did and tried to do, Stephen.<//review>

Got the job done but it took the tech too long to fix the problem. Company charges $250 dollars an hour. The kitchen only needed the faucet replaced with new plumber lines. 1/2 hour job turned to a 2 hour job. I personally had to run for parts; at a nearby hardware store. I thought the company would provide parts unfortunately that was a “no”. Perfect place to call if you have an emergency when their is a water leak in the house.</Review>< pictures>

Tylor was friendly and professional.  He wore a mask, shoe covers which I appreciate very much. He explained what he would do and gave me cost upfront.  He went to work right away and made the repairs. I will be calling when help is needed again. Although I hope it is not soon. 🙂</text>

<date>1611862347639<//date><rate>5<//rate><Text>Jonathan arrived at our home shortly after I called.  He was very professional, he informed me of the policies and any guarantees that he might be able to leave me with.  Unfortunately because there were tree roots in our system the guarantee would not be available.  He suggested that we video our system to see where the roots and any damage might be in the system.  We were not able to pay for that at this point in time but he indicated that it would be available ay a later date if we decided to do this.  Jonathan was very polite and made sure that I was aware of the problem and he was helpful in getting the lock off our gate and replaced it when the service was completed.  I would definitely recommend Jonathan again and ask for him in the future if this type of service is needed.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Tylor was good and responsive. Took care of cleaning out the pipe for our kitchen sink.

Great work. Even covered under the remaining warranty.

Thanks to the great teamwork.

Jacob was extremely professional and friendly and was able to identify the cause of our leak as well as another issue that might have caused trouble down the line. He explained everything thoroughly and was very patient in ensuring that we understood our options and the implications of all possible courses of action.

Jacob did not pressure us to do anything but empowered us to make the appropriate decision by providing plenty of information. He was timely, efficient and pleasant, and took care to be respectful of our concerns around covid. Thanks, neighbor! :)<//Text>

Our whole system was clogged and he took care of the problem quickly and efficiently. Brandon F.

I just took the longest, best shower of my life. Jacob from Roto-rooter near Modesto and Manteca came to  my rescue when our bathroom began to back up. Toilet water in the tub. Sink water in the toilet. It was a nightmare come true and when everything seemed to be getting worse it definitely didn't stop. Jacob showed up quickly and immediately got to work. He was very nice and worked his butt off to diagnose our problem, which turned out to be 4 feet of roots invading out pipeline. He also pointed out we didn't have a cleanout to quickly fix the clog and future clogs. He worked his magic to get us all fixed up at a very reasonable price. Jacob did all the work himself in less time then I've seen a whole crew do. I have so much peace of mind now knowing exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. If you're looking for someone in the 209 area to fix your plumbing and not just bandage it up, I highly recommend Roto-rooter. Jacob, if you happen to read this someday, thank you so so very much.</text>

Jonathan did a great job unclogging my kitchen sink.  Answered all my questions and didn’t push me to pick one thing or another but left it to me.   He also talked to my son about entering the trade.  Always know job gets done well with this company unlike others that I’ve used in past and have made issue a bigger issue.</Text>

Nothing changed.  The tech, Maulden Karl, checked & tried to find a leak(s) of which the City of Ceres stated that it seemed I was losing 50 gallons of water.  But he did not find any leak @ all after a thorough check in & around my property.< /Review>

Stephen was fantastic, had a clogged drain on a weekend and he identified the problem immediately and was very upfront with cost and expectations. Very professional, and patient despite my curiosity and questions. Awesome service, and awesome person. Would recommend him to anyone with an issue.< /text>

<Text>I had an outdoor drain that wasn't carrying rain water away. Tylor showed up to water jet the line and found that I had a blockage. With a little assistance from Nickolas and his camera they were able to pinpoint the location of the blockage. Tylor made the repair in good time and I'm happy with the result. I appreciate the professionalism of both of these gentlemen and their willingness to make sure that I was given all available options.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Would highly recommend if you are needing a professional and communicated company. I needed help with plumbing and septic service at my elderly fathers house. This company went above and beyond helping get his septic system fixed and communication was key to making this easy on myself. Phillip the plumber was a rock star and handled everything from the start to finish. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//text>< Pics>

Do not think twice! Call them right now!!!
Those guys are professionals and extremely honest about what can and cannot be performed and if there is another way around to save money with it, like contacting the City or maybe different and cheaper service options they provide.
They saved me $13k and helped me to contact the City who will be installing the new pipes for me.
Thank you Alain and Mauro, you guys are AMAZING!</review>

<review>Robert Quindiagan arrived promptly and was friendly and knowledgeable throughout the whole process. He inspected my toilet and the leak and suggested multiple options (along with estimates) to deal with the issues present. I ultimately chose to have a new toilet installed as it was the best course of action in the long run.

Robert then left to get the new toilet and came back to install. The whole visit was about three hours from arrival and inspection to install and finish. I was impressed with how quickly Roto-Rooter responded to my request for service and even more impressed with how quickly said service was performed.

I’m very pleased with the job done and the price and absolutely recommend Robert and Roto-Rooter and will call on them for any future needs.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Technician Christopher Robinson was very professional and used safety(mask) throughout his service. Explained what was wrong and what he was repairing/replacing. Our shower faucet had been leaking for the past two months and we thought it had something to do with the shower head but after it continued to leak after replacing it with the new one. We called in and Christopher fixed it within a hour. We are very thankful.<//review>

I called in the morning around 7a because we were having issues with draining in our home. Spoke to
Claudia, she set me up right away, within 2 hours I got a text stating that my plumber was on his way. The text provided me a tracker for their ETA and notified that our plumber John was on his way to help us. He was professional, explained everything thoroughly, and honest. I would highly recommend Roto-Rooters< /Review>

Seems like Tech didn't want to help me at all.  Just throwing outrageous prices out so that I won't do the job.  Probably  wanted to go home because it was late afternoon Saturday.  He Was, going to charge me a little over $400 just to install my existing garbage disposal. First and last time with this company.<//text>

They came out late last night and tried to do a simple snake process and found out it was a lot bigger deal so at 8am they brought out the heavy-duty equipment along with the camera and had it done within a few hours.. the workers worked very hard and we were very friendly and I would recommend them toanybody in need any type of Plumbing Service...thank you,
Mark Modean.

Two workers just came by and fixed an issue the last guys didn't do right...I don't know their names but they did a quick and efficient job...
Thank you,  Mark Modean</text>

$750 for a camera inspection is insulting.I understand the drain scope machine cost 10-15k and times are hard but as a business owner I believe you should atleast be competitive.Thank you for the estimate.<//text>

< Review>
Roto Rooters technicians not only failed to remove the duct tape from four out of the five roof vents after attempting a smoke test, but their toilet installer did not seal the new toilet he installed with a bead of caulk at the toilet's base after he installed it.  How amateurish and unprofessional!  Not holding my breath for satisfactory resolution.  They will probably ignore me now that they have the money I paid for unsatisfactory service.

The bathroom still smells of awful sewer odors at this time!  This is what they were called to resolve in the first place!

We are very disappointed with Roto Rooter.

Roto Rooter was only too happy to take our money for services that failed to resolve the original problem for which their services were retained.

Not happy.< /Review>

<text>Roto Rooter Plumber quoted me $3,500 to clear a blockage just downstream of a clean out.  4" clay sewer main was 2.5' deep, only had to expose about 5' in unsurfaced dirt, no concrete or Asphalt to remove and restore.  Took me 2 hours to dig it myself and a couple more hours to get parts and make repairs.  Completely unreasonable, price gouged - borderline theft.  Roto Rooter should be ashamed of themselves!!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I had a problem with the main sewer everything was backing up to the shower to the toilet to the sink and I have called alot of plumbers to come out and they told me I had to look for the clean out I have no idea where the clean out is coz the house is kinda old but the plumbers couldn't help me it took them days to come out so I called roto rooter spoke to Angela she got me a plumber within 1 hour Brandon came to the rescue he was very professional he already knew the problem and even knew where my clean out was where the other plumbers didn't even have no clue  Brandon did an amazing job and we found out what caused the clog it was disinfection wipes they don't dissolve at all and whats also good news they gave me a warranty for 6 months just in case something goes wrong the other plumbing services don't even give u that so I highly recommend Roto-rooter they r the best when it comes to ur plumbing needs specially ask for Brandon he gets the job done fast.< /Review><user_name>Joanne Mariano<//user_name>< response>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Was given empty promises prior to signing the contract for the job of pipe switch outside rhe house , after contract was signed for the job all the parts that were promised to be done never happened. Nick made all these promises to convince me into agreeing to get the job started, don't let these empty promises happen to you.
1. Will be done with 2-3 days then after signing contract no crew available til next week.
2. Project manager Nick from Manteca area promised to stop by after job is complete perform a complementary camera view through the pipes to show it’s all performed correctly. Never happened didn’t check in During or after the job.
3. Was promised that the concrete hole on the drive way will be filled. Per nick “I promise we will fill the concrete hole on the drive way after the job is done even if I have to pull favors.” Never reached out after the job now I have a big hole on the drive way. Which was the reason I didn’t want the job performed at first.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>I am an apartment manager and I have dealt with so many different plumbing companies and this companies is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with. The plumber was scheduled for 8am amd didnt come until 4pm. And then was there for 2 hours and didnt fix anything and actually made the issue worse and instead of fixing the job because they are supposedly 24 hours he left for the day because his shift was over and didn't  turn the tenants water back on and they have a newborn baby with NO WATER in their unit . I called their customer service multiple times to have this figured out and they are so unprofessional and didnt send anyone back out to at least fix the tenants water amd told me they would call me back each time I called amd no one ever called back.  Never have I experienced such unprofessional and such unskilled service from any company. Warning. Their reviews are fake and do not trust this company.</Review><date>1601437114411< /date>< UserId.>
