< Review>
One of the most down to earth diners in Southern California. The local staff makes us always feel at HOME when we dine here. Whether it's breakfast, brunch, or craving biscuits and gravy... we can never go wrong with food here. Stop in and enjoy the warm friendly vibe with great food. This is a spot to meet the locals.<//Review>

I don't care what anyone says.  It's eclectic, historical and serves great brussel sprouts and corned beef and hash.   So good I've been many times and cannot order anything else.</Text>

<time>1598830581403< /time><Rating>3< /Rating><review>I am not sure why this place was lined-up like a snake. . But yeah, for brunch this place pretty much comfy and easy spot. Closed to 55-S freeway. The food that I picked (French Omelet) was not so good as I expected. The option for the omelet you can just added 2 for the topping. Otherwise, you have to pay .50 for each option (not worthed). But with other food, chicken fried steak, the gravvy looks good. And the presentation for corned beef and eggs was not we thought. . . They gonna have dinner launching on September 8th,2020 for tacos special. But need reservations first for limited space.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqGHU-KFNK7pRZnxyff1wW1FlXXfE44mI82Rfu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3O32c_k6mxAYrbClsCP3Lo9gBpkCUcCNhjRIV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0E1bKvfM9cyoSIwGAlRuPiiFBBH43JytZo9qA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrJdIVXKHwRy-DcW61_nH-QIX5y-7WDisYvA2P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNF6ea2WVWc5X5RTFnapzM88ujpvWr2jeWIT_F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_3ocgfT0bXyRuwTO6ikDAl4SZ5tFi7v-6FKBR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAPnd0cslZg_op_2_YB5zPMaYwLNjPyrakHrex=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1EihvQ9qfnaYnNA5nhRr13zycYQQP5fC60o6z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSmuXqLefnbDKkvlkRTe7obZ6MrcRwfy4lJako=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm5hWPYneMOKZX5ZLyklrCE6MNHmwIyFdKx5gm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEQJKZ-Ifs9uyR22AKMADoWAgNXYuehW0SHq9U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcaqGGjht99E1h1VJ-vEw1FqyqB7s48drCPori=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMREUT5m5gVafLRVNC2lVpwnlx5Xx9y6rZ-u1Cj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1601487430422, 'text': 'Thanks Lita'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf0938da4aa5:0x46d5f96ea8d771e8< /Gmap_id></record>

Great food but got my debit card mixed with another person's order. She re-rang my order..my bill was quite a bit more than my original ticket. Need to do 1 ticket at a time..not pick up several at one time. My bad..next time I will watch out.<//Text>

<time>1616175888594</time><Rate>1</Rate><Review>Disappointed.  I never got served.  So here is my disappointment.  I had to be at the airport by a given time.  Before I sat down I told the hostess about my time restrictions. Asking if I had enough time, was told no problem.  (Had about 45 minutes till I’d have to leave).

Well after 35 minutes I still wasn’t served.

Of course it took them a while to take my order.  I was ready to order when my coffee came but they weren’t ready to take my order.

My issue is this, if I tell you I have a time restriction and you can’t meet it. Let me know.  If I tell you I have a time restriction, maybe make sure you get my order quickly.

I travel for a living and I often run into time crunches. Nearly every place hustles when I let them know< /Review>< pictures>

The chicken fried steak was also good. Nicely seared corned beef hash. Unfortunately the pancakes are rubbery, which means the batter was over mixed. Excellent French toast. The lumberjack breakfast is not on the menu but comes with extra meat, eggs, potatoes, and pancakes. The omelette is good but you should ask for it soft because they really overcook it.< /text>< Pictures>

Fabulous old school diner with great food and sassy service. The Business Breakfast was great, super crisply bacon, delicious sausage and toast with poached egg. Apparently this place has been here since 1947. Seventy years and still going strong, unsurprising given the great food, service and colourful and friendly local clientele. Loved it.< /text>

<Text>We missed breakfast at our hotel because we slept in late, so we were lucky to find Dick Church's Restaurant nearby. This is a great little diner and you can tell there's a lot of tradition there and the people serving us just provide excellent food and service like it's second nature. We tanked up with a meal from a menu that had something everyone wanted and had a nice day as a result.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Been living in Newport for the past 35 years.  Decided to drop into Dick Church’s for brunch withy my son yesterday.  Menu has so many options it was hard to choose.  Selected the chili cheese omelet with sour dough bread, and it was awesome.  The chili was perfect, and the sour dough was thick and tasted home made.  Can’t wait to go back and try the many other things on the menu.  The waitress was very nice and accommodating.  Five star rating people.  Check it out.</review>

The French Toast Combo I got was very good.  However, after the waitress took my order she disappeared.  That's the reason for a 4 instead of a 5.</Review>

<review>Breakfast was perfect.  My omlet was made with real shell eggs. The hashbrowns were like fried potatoes my Grandmother used to make. Food was served quickly and our server was cheerful.  It felt like walking into a family place in a small town.  First visit,  but it won't be our last. Excellent food at good prices.< /review>< Pics>

Awesome little place. Very helpful and accommodating as well. Had just come in from a morning run and was burning up, and they moved me to a different by seat and turned on the AC to help me cool down. Also, their omelette was delicious as well, and their coffee want overall bitter or strong.< /Text>

Absolutley love this place. My friend and I were looking for a nice place to eat for brunch and came upon this place. I can say I'm not disappointed in the least. Food is great, atmosphere is very home feeling, and staff are very welcoming. It's my home away from home while I'm at college. I'm definitely coming back more often.<//text>

The only reason why I gave this place a 1 star is the servers! They were very nice! I can't say the same about the food! The hash browns were tasteless as was the French toast! We will never come back again! My wife almost threw up after a couple of bites! I can't believe this place is open!</text>

Just don't eat here. Not for a while at least. They are "upgrading, remodling", & it is my greatest hope by virtue of this Prime location they will begin to use Quality food & hire some real, actual chefs or cooks that can cook. Even my worst fast food experience surpasses this ace. WTH.<//Review>

<review>Classic Diner...could be one of the last in Newport/Costa Mesa.  It's a legend.

Food is good but what makes the difference are the wait staff...so friendly and warm...even more if it's your first time you will be treated like a regular.

All the usual favorites plus menu for those over 55...

Love it!<//review>< pics>

Cozy little old school coffee shop. Been there for years. Waitress was pleasant, but didn't get my order right. Could have been my fault as I changed my mind on two items. Quality was fine and quantity was fine. It's nice because it isn't super busy.< /Text>

<review>Adorable little old diner, like I stepped back 50 years, in the best way. Great family positive atmosphere, very friendly service. All three of my friends ordered different vegetarian breakfasts and enjoyed them - so don't worry about being swamped in greasy meat food (unless you want to be! Plenty of stuff for the meat-lovers too). Overall, good food, delightful service, homey atmosphere. Very pleasant breakfast experience!< /review><user>115537056282640949465< /user><Time>1479922023918< /Time>< name>

The rest of the food from their menu I can't review because I haven't tried it (and I never will!).

<Review>We live in Florida visiting our sons here in Cali. We were looking for a friendly hometown diner and found this place. It was close by I just wish it was in FL. Service is fantastic, the staff is so friendly and welcoming. We ate breakfast almost every day during our stay. The place is very clean and the food was good and plentiful. We'll miss it but will come back when we visit again. Thanks!!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dcdf0938da4aa5:0x46d5f96ea8d771e8</gmap_id>< UserId.>

I go here on Sunday mornings after church with my family. All the waitresses are smart and provide fast service.  One year we reserved the back room so we could have a family get together for my Mom's birthday.  It was fun!  The waitresses helped bring the cake out and sing "happy birthday ".

My experience was more than great. Originally made my reservation for 5. Went down to 2 and at the last minute went back to 4, then 5, then 6. The place was packed yet the staff made room for us. I know we were being a pain yet staff was more then helpful. The food was great and service was wonderful. Old friends catching up and weren't rushed at all. All around great experience.<//Review>

The staff was incredibly friendly and made me feel very comfortable. The food was awesome!

-1 for the price though. $20 for 2 plates at breakfast is too much for me to go back often. I will definitely go back though!<//review>

The food was average. The chicken fried steak tasted like a cheap piece of beef. The gravy on top was not very flavorful. The eggs were eggs, hard to screw that up. The hash browns were decent. The service was okay, nothing stood out or extra friendliness. Overall, this is a local staple, but the quality is just not very good.<//review>

Eggs Benedict and hashbrowns with onions and peppers was her recommendation. Upon serving, she said to lightly squeeze some lemon on top. Sweet Baby Jesus. DC’s is my go to place for breakfast now when I’m in the area. Looking forward to my next trip.< /Review>

We will never go back. The service was (to be kind) "lacking". People seated 15 minutes after us received their order well before us. By the time we got our food, the pancakes were so tough we had to rip them apart, the eggs were cold and the corned beef hash (that was still in the shape of the can it came from) was burnt beyond belief. Nasty. When the waitress took our plates there wasn't even a question as to why most of the food was still on them or to ask how the food was. I even tried to tell the cashier when he asked me how it was and he just stared and blinked at me. NEVER AGAIN.</review>

<UserId.>117952052531405400321< /UserId.><rating>2<//rating><Text>The menu is old school diner food, which is normally awesome.  I got the chili omelette with hashbrowns.  The waitress asked if I wanted onions with the omelette,  and if onions and bell peppers were ok for the hashbrowns.  My wife got the green chili and avocado omelette. When the food arrived the first thing I noticed was the pile of raw onions on top of the omelette,  and a equal pile of raw onions and peppers on my hashbrowns.  Normally they're cooked inside, and cooked with the hashbrowns. Once I scraped the raw veggies off, the omelette was pretty good.  The hashbrowns were almost nonexistent,  which is probably why they piled the raw veg on top. My wifes green chili omelette had a few diced chilis, but couldn't find the avocado. She still said it tasted ok, but nothing special.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Even tho norms tries to give u pancakes too. I cant eat all that and I dont like wasting food. I like paying a good price for what I know I'm really gonna eat.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>stopped for breakfast after the swap meet. The service was very friendly, never had an empty cup of coffee. The portions are kind of small, but the food was just like how mom made it back when i was a kid. I really liked how the servers left me alone and let me eat.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Where to begin... let’s see the store has absolutely no prices marked on their shelves and the ones that are are only there to deceive you. As when you go to pay for your purchases the price that you are charged are simply higher upon check out. When you ask why that is the price, that the posted price was lower the simple response you get is “that is an old price”. The lady that owns the store is possibly the worst customer service person in the history of customer service. Very rude. I would suggest going to the other convenience store only a few short blocks away.
Steer clear.</Review>

It's nice to have near by for quick buys. Attracts some colorful folk. Not as bad as Stop and Rob on B and Wabash.< /Text>

Insulting. Everything is more expensive than anywhere else in the country. The most expensive liquor store in history. The prices are awful. They over charge in everything. They go as far as getting at the very least an extra 25 CENTS from anywhere they can. Everywhere else could be $1, modern glass would be $2.25. How is this fair? Wow are you ripping off your loyal customers. Don't take advantage of people's habits.

Not cool. Don't support this guy. Go to Beverly Hills.

Stay tuned for photo evidence.< /review>

I will continue to do business with them until other people about them. and I love the fact that when you get a flat tire they take care of you. Most of the time with no charge.

<Review>Fast, courteous, and very busy. I'm always impressed by Americas Tire and this location stands out for their efficient and friendly approach. Just be aware that if you want to walk in you should come 15 min before they open because it is busy!</Review>< time>

<text>America's Tire has always treated me good here at the Napa store. Way back when they did a deal on just 1 tire for me until payday so I could drive to and from work(Trader Joe's)for the next week. Then I was able to do the 4 tire deal. They have helped co-workers on their tire repairs as well with plugs, valve stems and with great deals too. And not everyone was a previous customer. I do live in Napa yet they were across the street from my old store. I have purchased my 3rd set of tires from the Napa store today because they treated me good in a hard time in the past as also some friends.<//text>< userid>

Raul helped me fill the tires in my new electric bike. He had to get a manual air pump so the stronger air pump wouldn't damage my tires. They have a free air station.</text>

Did a good job on my F150. David was great. Only advice to management would be to call once vehicle is ready, and give a quick clean of the wheels. There was a lot of yellowish lube residue on the  wheels from mounting. But overall a good experience. I would recommend!<//text>

Great service. Great prices on tires. Especially if you can get them when they have rebates through they're credit card. This is the only place I go for tires. They have no issues with my Model S or my Model 3. Wish they did alignments though.</text>

<Review>I made an appointment to Rotate tires, at time of appointment, Technician informed me That my front tires had a small degree of wear and could not be mounted by rotation and could not be put back on the vehicle if removed, therefor i had to purchase 2 new tires. The tires were not unsafe in any way due to the small degree of wear. This was a  blatant scare tactic to sell new tires and I caution Americas Management that it is very discouraging to see a   great company use such shoddy and fraudulent sales method.

I was impressed by the great customer service. From the phone call I made to the time I left the store. I bought two new tires which they installed. Then they rotated all my tires and pulled and patched two nails without my even asking and at no extra charges. Very impressed!< /Review>

I do not usually write reviews but I had the best experience at America's Tire in Napa on 5/21/19. I was going to work this morning and my low tire pressure light came on.  I pulled into America's Tire just as they opened.  They got me in, confirmed I had a nail in my tire.  The staff is super friendly and professional and they had me back on the road in less than an hour.  I will definitely be going back when I need a new set of tires.<//Review>

Making an appointment was a part of the check out process and they call you with a reminder about it the week of. The installation of two tires was expected to be 45 minutes but they texted me in 25.

I bought several tires from this place in Napa.  They are very professional and fair to their customers.  I ordered tires from the website last 11/27. Tires never came in after 2 weeks.  When i ordered another tire and came for an appointment to replace my previous order the tires i ordered were defective.  The manager of the store Brennan compensated me for the time i waited for the new tires to come in with a very sincere discount for the problems i encountered. With that said every thing went well and i have a good set of tires with a very good discount.  This tires shop live up to their words....they will never fail you .......I strongly recommend this shop! very clean and professional people. Thank You Brennan! you are the best!!!!  thank you again!< /review>

<Text>I came in with a slow leaking tire and they would have fixed free of charge but they showed me how worn the tire was and how they couldn’t repair it. Turns out all my tires were in the same condition. I decided to have all 4 replaced since I was about to drive 8 hours. They gave several options with a good warranty. I was so glad they had the tires I wanted in stock. They were professional, knowledgeable and very helpful!<//Text>< Time>

Tyler is very knowledgeable, was able to give me advice for the right tire to suit my needs. I wanted a performance tire that rides quiet, he recommended the Michelin Pilot Sport 3 Plus. Awesome Tires so I went for it. Well worth it. Go see these guys and they will point you in the right direction.<//Text>

Could not be happier with the service I received. I got two new tires at a price that was very fair.  As I sat there in the waiting lounge sipping a warm cup of complimentary coffee I attempted to write  a short email , but I got cut short because my car was already done.  Absolutely satisfied with the very friendly staff, and I was in and out.  No complaints.  Thanks guys<//text>

A.T. (Discount Tires outside California) great- consistent customer service, rotation/repairs, n competitive prices. Whether it's my SUV, PU, 5thWheel(13k mi/26 states) or boat trailer. They're busy, so scheduling is best.</text>

<Review>Bought my tires here a few months back and the service was good. Today I got a nail in one of my tires.They repaired my tire free of charge. Thank you! It is terrible getting a nail hole in your tire but when they came through with the free repair of my tire it made it a little less stressful. Thanks again. Will buy next tires here. I recommend buying tires at America's tire. Thanks again.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Got a flat off-roading in Knoxville and literally not a single tire repair store was open on the weekend in any of these small towns. Called and told these guys it’d take an hour and a half to get there, which would put us right at closing. They said no problem, that they’d make sure we were taken care of and that was the truth! Got there just before 5 and the whole thing took 30 mins max. Super nice guys, service fees much cheaper than other places we’ve been ($19 for one tire). Super convenient, highly recommend!<//Review>

Good fast service. I feel like the tire they replaced could have been priced more competitively but you get what you pay for I guess. I called around and they were much more expensive than costco but much faster and no membership required.<//text>

Long story short, I noticed my flat tire first thing in the morning, had no idea why it was flat.  America's tire was right next door so I drove it over.  I dropped off my vehicle because of the wait. 2 hours later, they called to say all 4 of my tires needed to be replaced.  I said no.  They said they're very old, very poor quality, and they will not fix the 1 tire because it is pulling apart and too dangerous to fix.  I said my tires are only 1 year old and from Costco.  They changed their story, 2 tires were new, and 2 were old and needed to be replaced.  They had no spares to sell.  Their cheapest tire that could get me to a Costco was $175.  Then I asked how much to replace the 2 back tires.  They said they only had 1 tire similar quality to the Bridgestone I had on the front, and that would cost $140... So why was that option cheaper when I asked which was the cheapest tire...  So I told them I'm not the car owner, it's officially my parents, here is my dad's phone number.  20 minutes later, no one had called my dad so I had him call the shop.  Rather than lie to my dad, they fixed up the tire that was previously deemed "dangerous and irreparable" and I went back and picked up my car.  While the mechanic/salesperson may have been correct in saying I needed new tires, they first tried to sell me 4 tires when 2 are still new, and then lied about the ability to fix my tire.  I do not plan on going back to an America's Tire.</review>

After working with Brendan I'll never go back to this place. I went here for years till It took them 3 months to replace a pair of wheels. They threw away the wheels when I went in to have tires  unmounted and discarded. He then tred to con me into buying a whole new set of wheels.< /review>

The tires are good quality, and the warranties are top notch, however the salesmen are very high pressure, and greatly lacking in charm or any vestige of customer relations skills. They are soulless automatons reciting rote in monotones, and don't back off their pitch even when asked to. If you like being pushed around by aggressive young men, then American Tire Company in Napa is the place for you.< /Text>

< Review>
There isn't words that I can express on how thankful iam to these guys, I called and asked if there was any way I could get a discount on my front tires because I needed to get out of town with my kids due to evacuation from the fires I had barely any money and they said they take a look at it next thing you know I have new tires on the the front of my car at no charge I wish I could remember the guy that helped me he said not to worry that they would make sure me and my kids would make it out safely. OMG I did not know what to say other then thank you so much . Thanks to them I was able to get my kids out of all the smoke . I'll get his name and thank him again for what he did . Thanks alot from me and my family .</Review>

I got 2 tires a few months ago for 179 $ i know there was no deal i just went with the cheapest set. I only go to and from work really so i dont need rugged tires. i went back today to get the same or simmilar tires and now it has jumped in price 319!! I just feel like that is a crazy price diffrence. If i was not in need of tires badly i would wait untill monday and shop around that is for sure.< /Text>

< Review>
good tires, great service, great price, I read reviews about repairing old tires..I have had old tires fail not only on my truck but on my bike (10 speed) they are correct in telling you to replace them, you can damage your car or yourself or even worse hurt or kill someone........buy new tires</Review>

The food was delicious and authentic! The portions were large and the prices low.

Really enjoyed our first visit here. The wait staff was also very polite and informative as well as bilingual.< /text>

Love this place. I hope they have enough customers to stay in business... Every time we go, there's no one there, but the food is 💣 bomb and the salsa is good so i try to tell as many people as I can about this place. 💕  I just think not many people know how good it is...< /Text>

<Text>Had the fish soup and Jamaica drink, was good.  Had to tell out to the waitress to bring our check, she was immersed in a conversation with the cook and did not hear me calling her, waving frantically at her, I finally literally yelled out EXCUSE ME!  And she then turned around.  BUT on other visits with a different waitress, the experience and food were great!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Its a good small restaurant, we were in the mood for Mexican and this place had good reviews so we thought we would give it a try. We had tacos and enchiladas and Tacos were authentic and very flavorful. We recommend it and will definitely come back. The portions are large and you will definitely leave full. Chips and salsa are complementary and the drinks are free refills.< /Review>

<Review>Went to Sunday brunch at Taps and have a mixed review. First, the good! Great service with friendly not overbearing wait staff. Champagne refills kept coming. Relaxed atmosphere. No need to rush. Buffet included some salads, crab legs, calamari, cheese platters, carving station, etc. The usual suspects. You can order off of the menu, which is nice.< /Review>< time>

<review>Love the Tri-tip steak here. Ribs are great too. BBQ is very nice. The sides are great, especially like the asparagus. Good wine list. Take all my out-of-town company here. Everyone enjoys it. Take a seat on the outdoor patio. Nice and quieter than the restaurant.<//review>< rating>

I ordered the three tacos for$11.00 the steak is awful! Get the carnitas instead. Better yet go to portofino dos tacos. It’s only $1.39 and you can get 5 fresh tasty tacos with all the veggies you want and the fresh salsa you want.</Text>

It was a language barrier, I was double-charged, was unable to explain her error to her. She was unable to credit my credit card with a overcharge so she had to give me cash back. I had taken a picture in of the food that I wanted that I had their previously thinking there might be a problem. Showed her the picture when I got home what I got wasn't what was in the picture. I accepted the price had gone up considerably from the previous time but Double--- no way.</review>< rating>

<Review>Food was good, plate was too small for price. Ordered 3 taco plate, tacos were very small but very nicely presented and tasted amazing. Probably wouldn't eat again if I was looking for value for my dollar.<//Review></record>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I ordered chicken taquitos and they didn’t have chicken so they substituted with beef. The beef had no flavor and tasted very weird. I told the waitress and she took the plate back. She came back 5 minutes later telling me it tasted good to her so... I had to tell her again that it just didn’t taste right to me.  So awkward.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

This place is an absolute gem! Truly THE BEST Mexican breakfast I have ever eaten! We stopped here by chance on our way to Borrego Springs State Park from LA and we were blown away! The huevos rancheros are to die for, the chips and salsa are out of this world and the service was fantastic! We loved it so no we had to stop again on our way back!

I will dream about this breakfast for the rest of my life!!!</Review>

I didn't like the service there i ordered the tacos for 3.25 and I asked the waitress if it came with rice and beans because of the picture that was shown next to the description where it says taco plates and she said yes so I went ahead and got that and burrito but then I went to pay and she charged me for 11.95  for the taco plate ?!!! They shouldn't have put a picture of a plate that doesn't go with the food next to it and then we asked her for a discount she said you are not going to get a plate of three tacos and rice and beans for 3.25  but I asked her for what was next to the Taco plate that said 3.25 it wasn't my fault she wasn't specific and didn't say the picture didn't go with the price for the three tacos that it was next to it  😠😠 it was my first time there and last time< /Text>

Finally great BBQ in San Jose. I use to travel to Austin, Texas and they know BBQ out there. I haven't found a place that could come close to it except for Malibu Grill and BBQ. Excellent Brisket and Ribs and sides are really good too. This will be our go to BBQ restaurant.</Text>

The recently upgraded Malibu Grill & BBQ is off the chain with their barbecue!!  There is no real barbecue in or near San Jose and now we have incredible bbq in our backyard.  If you want to know what excellent bbq tastes like, come check it out.< /Review>

I love this place! The food is amazing and the staff is great. I wish they had a little more room inside. Other than the space issue, A+. The Malibu Stix are fantastic and I think everyone should give them a try. We will continue to be loyal customers. Thank you!<//review>

Wait Time: 10-20 Minutes for food.

Unique Factor: 2/5 - The menu is not particularly unique to Malibu Grill & BBQ , I would say it is pretty similar to your typical burger joint. However, the ratio and the cook of their burger makes them different than your other burger places, one where you have to taste to understand.

Service: Fast Food Style with a hip interior decor. Malibu Grill & BBQ</Review>

<review>I've been going to Malibu Grill for a good couple of decades. They consistently serve up great burgers and I really enjoy the Philly cheese steak with jalapeños (Philly on Fire). It is also very casual and a comfortable environment with some classic arcade games and even a beer and wine bar in the back. I tried the place because it was close, and I've been going back ever since. Much recommend!</review></record>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Go to neighborhood spot for viewing sports, excellent service, and best known for burgers and brews. Salads, chicken , sandwiches AND pizza fill out a great varied menu.

The only reason I can't give 5 stars is the use of space. Definitely not ADA friendly, the location next to 7-Eleven in a tiny strip mall limits what they can do, but tables and chairs are completely crowded. Doesn't stop me from going back.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Food took FOREVER to show up, however, it was a busy night so I can cut them some slack. Food was pretty good, and at least they had arcade machines and tvs for entertainment while we waited.</Text>

Western burger is amazing 👌. Be careful with the word combo though, as here it means you want half a chicken, half rack of ribs, and a side; Not fries and a drink 🤣<//Text>

Malibu Grill & BBQ is a neighborhood joint where locals were sitting at the bar and at the tables. People were introducing themselves to each other and were quite friendly. This is a counter service restaurant that delivers food to your table after you order. I was a little put off by the fact that if you use a credit card, their point of sale system nags you for a tip with 15% being the least amount you can choose. I think I counter service restaurant should not ask for a 15% tip. I had a Philly tri-tip cheese-steak sandwich but the meat was cut into small pieces rather than prepared Philadelphia style. The food was okay but not spectacular. The food was somewhat expensive and I think they should be able to pay their servers rather than nag people for a tip at a counter service restaurant.<//Text>

<Review>My first time coming into this tucked away spot. I ordered the Western Burger and nice cold Ipa from the mini bar. Western Burger was delicious and the IPA was alright. I hope that sometime in the near future they have rotating craft brews to compete with the other restaurants in the area. The food is there, now they just need some varietal beer choices and the place would be slammed daily.<//Review><userid>101069152032996128874< /userid><rate>5<//rate><name>Sandeep Pooru<//name>< pictures>

<text>Always great food. The bacon burger and Philly on Fire are my favorites. But I have yet to be let down by this place.

Edit: I'd just like to report some interesting developments about this local eatery. In their basement, they are traff... wait no, wrong pizza place.

Edit2: I just ordered a bacon cheeseburger with sauteed onions and BBQ sauce, sub onion rings instead of the fries. This is the high point of my day, although there's forecasted improvements thanks to my burger/day consumption rate predicted to increase within the next fifteen minutes.<//text>< user_name>

<Text>We came to Malibu Grill for dinner tonight and had a bad experience. The cashier was super friendly and made sure our order was correct and that's was the only good part of our service tonight.  Our order took a long time to come out, and when it did, they only brought us 3 entrees instead of the 4 we ordered. They had forgotten to make the last burger. The cashier said she would have them make the other burger right away. I had ordered a honey mustard chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Both came out cold. I would prefer a hot meal but I was okay eating a cold sandwich because I was hungry.  I was not okay with the cold fries especially since they charge $3 more for the upgrade to sweet potato fries. I asked her for new fries because they were cold and she said that they would be out in a few minutes. I took a bite of my sandwich and realized that there was no honey mustard on the sandwich at all.  I waited a few minutes for thr cashier to come back then took it up to the kitchen and explained what was wrong.  The cook took the plate from me. When he brought my sandwich back out, they had just slopped some honey mustard on the old sandwich. He said he'd make me a new one and asked if I wanted to keep the old one. I said I could give it to my dog. He gave me an new order of fries and never came back. They brought the missing burger about 5 minutes later and it was made with mayo although that's not how it was ordered; my dad just decided to scrape it off. I waited and waited for the new chicken sandwich and it never came. My mom went to the kitchen and asked about it and the cook said that they weren't making a new one but she could pay for another sandwich. My mom asked why she would pay for another sandwich when she had already purchased one and they screwed it up and had said they would make a new one for messing up. He said he was only going to redo the fries. The cook in the background was laughing about the situation. Super unprofessional! We have been coming here for years and have recommended it to many people. Now we won't be coming back!< /Text>< GmapID>

Not as good as before, I think they are trying to cut corners,my patty melt wasn't as good as I thought it should be! I think they also gave me turkey hamburger instead of beef.it has a different taste to it.</Text>

The Malibu Grill & BBQ (MGB) is a small family-run sports bar and grill that's been serving up quality grub since 1989. MGB is a little difficult to find, as it's tucked away in a decrepit strip mall deep in the Almaden Valley cuts. I have actually been coming here since before the Yelp mobile days, and the only way I found it was through a co-worker's word-of-mouth--ancient technology, I know, but still pretty reliable. However, with that being said, MGB is definitely worth seeking out if you're anywhere in the vicinity, as it has become my "go-to" spot for lunch when I'm nearby. They have a pretty extensive menu that ranges from BBQ and Pizza, to Burgers and Pasta. I usually stick with their burgers and hot sandwiches because they do those really well. Here are my Top 3:

Patty Melt- MGB has a terrific version of this classic Sammy; they serve it up with grilled onions, Swiss cheese, and Thousand Island dressing on traditional grilled Rye bread. This sandwich can be a bit heavy, but well worth it. This is my wife's favorite, and it has quickly become one of mine. 4.5*

Burgers- MGB has more burgers than you can shake a stick at. I've tried quite a few, and you really can't go wrong with any of them; it just depends on what you like, but you can't go wrong with a Bacon Avocado. Word of warning on The Big Kahuna: it really is massive--even I couldn't finish it. 4*

Philly on Fire Steak- This is not your classic Philly Cheesesteak, but a souped up Cali-version; they take Tri-Tip and serve it up with sauteed onions, red bell peppers and jalapeños on a garlic roll and top it with Swiss cheese. It's an ooey gooey meaty, spicy slice of heaven. They also serve up a non-spicy and chicken version (spicy and non) of this, so there's one to suite everyone's taste. 5*

Fries- All of MGB's sandwiches and burgers come with a heaping helping of their freshly made fries. Unfortunately, they're frozen, but they always fry them up fresh and they might be the best frozen fries I've had. Pro Tip: Parmesan and pepper shakers are readily available at the condiment bar. So what I like to do is shake them up over my fries and transform them into Parmesan-Chili fries. 4*

Service & Ambiance- The employees at MGB are always really nice, extremely helpful and will give you a good helping of Ranch, if you want it for dipping your fries. MGB has your classic neighborhood sports bar decor, as all the walls are adorned with local sports teams paraphernalia and memorabilia. It's also a terrific place to come catch a game because there's tons of TVs, everywhere. I was fortunate enough to catch a few World Cup games here during my lunch break, and I really had a hard time leaving--and not getting a beer. 4.5*

Value- Overall, MGB is a little on the pricier side, as a sandwich/burger with a drink will usually run you just shy of $15, but it's hard to complain about quality. 3.5*

So, in summation, if you're in south San José and are looking for a great place to eat, get a beer and/or watch a game, then MGB is what you want. It's an awesome little neighborhood spot, that gets my seal of approval. Highly, highly recommended!</text>

<name>Gregoor Wainwright< /name><text>More than one person can agree that It is hard to trust anyone to manipulate your vehicle. When I first took my vehicle for window tinting I was a bit scared the results would match my specification. Thankfully I opted for a reliable company where the installers gave me peace of mind from the beginning. After my car window tinting, I can feel the difference and how other car owners perceive my car. I simply love the elegance and brand new look of my vehicle.</text>< user>

I was debating whether to have window tint installed in my vehicle or not, so I talked to some friends and got their opinions and made up my mind. I took my car for window tinting recently and was amazed at the results, I showed my husband my car later that day, guess what, he was also very pleased and happy I managed to finally make up my mind. He will have his done next week, we can’t wait!< /Review>

Outstanding! I have been looking for an auto detailer for quite some time and was lucky enough to find Car Detail at Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Simi Valley. They immediately responded to my online pricing request and we scheduled the appointment right then and there. The store team is extremely courteous, friendly, and professional. They did an amazing job detailing my trip. Great prices and great customer service. I highly recommend it!</Review>

Having my windows tinted was probably the best thing I did with my car. I have to admit I was a bit insecure at the beginning but after scheduling an appointment and getting professional insight I made up my mind and decided car window tinting was definitely for me. It has been three months and I can feel the difference, especially because I drive for long hours on sunny days and I hate the feeling of being hot inside my vehicle. I would recommend it to every car owner.< /Text>

This place does not provide good quality tint installation. I have now taken my car to get the tint done here twice. The first visit was for the initial installation and then I had to take the car back because there were air bubbles and spots on every window. It’s now been over one week and there are still air bubbles and spots on the tint. There is even material stuck behind the tint. Avoid this place at all costs. My car will now be getting tint done for the third time.<//review>

When I first got my car I went straight to Conejo to have the windows tinted and clear bra installed. Ever since I’ve been going back for auto detailing and they always do such a great job! They deserve more than 5 stars and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to everyone looking for a reliable shop nearby.</text>

This shop is one of the best ones that I’ve been to. As soon as I walked in I noticed how nice and clean the place was. They greeted me nicely and answered all my questions about window tinting. They did an outstanding with the installation and I couldn't be happier.  I do think it was worth every penny and I highly recommend them.</review>

<Text>The guys from Conejo are awesome and did an amazing job with the window tinting for my Tesla Model 3. They are detail oriented and perfectionists. I really appreciated that. The car looks great!!! Whenever I get a new car I’ll make sure to go back! They took care of my car and made sure I was satisfied with the install.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>I highly recommend Conejo for window tinting and auto detailing. They do great work and have a lot of different tint options for you to choose from. They carry quality brands and I will be definitely coming back whenever I need to replace the film. They also have very fair prices.< /Text>< pictures>

I got a new ride for christmas and the first thing I did was look for a place for window tinting. I was overwhelmed with all the options online so I decided to ask for suggestions. My cousin recommended Conejo so I booked an appointment there. I really liked their customer service. The price was fair and the guys are very professional. They also followed all the covid protocols and I felt safe taking my car there. Thanks so much and I'm happy to recommend Conejo to everyone.<//text>

<Review>I found this company online and requested a quote for window tinting via email without expecting an answer right away. Well, in less than an hour I got a response back from them! I was impressed!!! The quote was more than fair so I called to follow up. The guy that I spoke with was very friendly and explained to me with great detail the whole process. Anyways, I’m very happy with how my windows turned out and I highly recommend Conejo.<//Review>< pictures>

Highly recommend this spot. Fast service and quality job. I come here every time that I’m looking for top quality window tinting (which is every time). The tinting is very durable and the staff very reliable, it’s worth every penny. You can see how they care about their customers. Five stars!<//Text>

Higher quality material is presented and demonstrated if you want it,  but is never pushed on you as an up sell.

Only concern was some water bubbles under the tint, but the few that were there have been drying up over the past week.</Text></record>

Nice owner, fully guarantees his work if problem. Reasonable pricing on window tinting, full detail and wax, and buffing scratch repair polishing paint services. Trust this pop owned detail place over any mobil detailer and commercial detail car wash places. Don't trust commercial car washes, they scratched my car paint pretty bad, never again. This place hand washes and waxes your vehicle, 1,000 times better and safe on your precious car paint.< /review>

<review>I was referred to Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Simi Valley by a friend who also got his car done here. They were very responsive and communicated really well, answering any questions I had prior to scheduling an appointment. Best window tinting job in all of Simi Valley. Unbeatable prices and great quality work. They finished in a reasonable amount of time and it even comes with a warranty. I went with carbon tints all around and it looks very beautiful.<//review>< Resp>

<review>If you're looking to get your windows tinted look no further, Conejo is where you should go! I called and talked to a few other companies about having our windows tinted in our new vehicle. The recommendations were to go dark, "it would look great".  Our main concern was safety and being able to see outside the windows out night.  When I called Conejo the guy explained a lot about the tint and that the black interior of the car will make the windows look a bit darker from the outside. I love what they did, it looks amazing!<//review>< pics>

The period of tinted home windows is constantly essential. There are windows that truly do not last as well as spoil or bleach fast and also I do not like that. When my best friend took me with you, I realized the massive distinction in high quality. I have actually been with your windows for numerous months and my auto is in good condition, those home windows are not damaged in any way, happily incredible!< /text>

I needed my Jeep tinted and didn't know anyone around. So, of course, I went to Google. Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Simi Valley had the best reviews and reached out. I sent a request on the weekend even when they were closed and immediately got a response. I am in the service business also and was surprised about the response time. I scheduled for the following week. I got a confirmation on the same day. My jeep was in and out quickly. Highly recommend them. Best products and pricing.<//text>

<Text>I just got my truck tinted at Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Simi Valley . First of all the crew was one of the friendliest ones I've ever met. They took the time to describe all the different films and even showed me a demo.I'm super happy I chose the nano-ceramic tint and my kids and dogs are also very grateful, we can definitely feel the difference. I got a great deal with the price, they are very competitive with other businesses around, and have the best quality for sure.</Text><user_name>Dileya Net<//user_name>< Time>

If you're someone who knows about details, however, you understand that high-end detailer (I wish there were a better word) like Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Simi Valley are few and far between, and their skill and craftsmanship justify what they charge. For 99% of people, this kind of work probably is overkill, but if you're between the small number of car enthusiasts, you will love working with Conejo. It's a pleasure to work with people who really cares about the work they do.<//Text>

<Text>I hate to sound like a broken record or just rehash what others have said, but... I've had my wife's car detailed at Conejo and my own car's windows tinted here as well, and I have nothing but good things to say. They also vacuumed out the interior and gave the exterior a quick wash, and the car looked amazing when I picked it up. Overall, they've made a customer for life and I will be back for future detailing work.< /Text>< Pictures>

I went online and found this place close to me. I headed there and an hour and a half later my truck was done and ready to go.  This is a business that cares about its customers and customer service.< /review>< Pictures>

Very good customer service with quality to answer any of your questions that you may have!

I went down the street in town to a few locations and was quoted 3x the price for the same vehicle with the same products and was treated with attitude. :(

These guys are doing it right!

Don't wast your time with the other tint heads.

You'll save right from the start!
With friendly service you can't beat it!

Quick update from end February to mid summer 19, no deformations, edge curls, blisters, or bubbles. Thanks Conejo for the Great work!</text>

I recently bought a car on Craigslist that didn't have its windows tinted. I thought I could pass with it but no way, I just couldn´t get used to it so I decided to look around for a good place to have it done and I bumped into Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Simi Valley and they offered me the best deal for sure. I love my new window tint, and they offer a pretty good guarantee.< /text>

If you are looking for a detail in Simi Valley, look no further! I took both of my cars to Conejo Auto Detail & Window Tinting Simi Valley for a much-needed detail and got major love for bringing both!! My husband’s car is a 2015 Mustang, which hadn't been detailed in years and had major trauma from three kids being in it!!  Not only did these dudes at Unique clean it up, but they also got it looking brand new!!!<//text>

Great Service and really good quality no bubbles and the 3M tint is definitely worth the upgrade. I have used other tint shops in Simi before other cars and the quality is not nearly as good I guess you get what you pay for. Highly recommend.</Text>

Fernando did a great job on the tint on my corvette.

Very meticulous and careful with the car

The crystalline 3M helped reduced interior temps 😎👍🏻< /Review>

< review>
We were having mechanical work done next to Conejo Auto Detail shop.
My wife who had never been there before went into Conejo Auto Detail shop by mistake.  Fernando (owner) was so nice to my wife, even walked her over to the shop doing the work on our car himself.

After my wife talked to Fernando, decided she wanted him to detail one of our cars.  The car was a 1990 MBZ, which we have owned since 1993 and have had detailed several times.

Ended up Fernando lives within a few blocks of our house and walked over to pick it up and also dropped it off to us. He was right on time picking up and delivering.

NOW THE MAIN THING -
When he dropped the car off, I couldn't believe how nice it looked.  I have NEVER seen it look that nice.  It looked like it just came from the show room floor.  The car is black, which is probably the worst color to wax without leaving swirl marks, I din't see one.

The car is 30 years ole and looks brand new.  We have a 1989 MBZ also we plan on him detailing for us.

I bowl with a bunch of seniors and a lot of  them have old antique cars which I will refer Fernando to them.</review>

Hidden place that worth finding. Service was fast and with a smile, and food was good. And at the end when we got the bill we agreed that pricing here is very good. Steak was cooked perfectly, coffee was hot and strong, and overall it is a place to return to.
I am happy I found this place and will return to it.< /text>

It has an old school diner type of feeling and that's because it's been around for 40 years! I love the decor and its prime location - found parking easily on-site. Immediately upon entering, our party of 5 was greeted with a big smile and quickly seated.
I personally loved the variety in their breakfast menu. I got to try a little bit of everything since all ordered different items. The Huevos a La Mexicana are superb! They had jalapeno but it wasn't overwhelming or too spicy; just right. Their homestyle potatoes are well seasoned and addicting! Their toast and coffee was on point, and our server did an excellent job in ensuring our mugs were never empty. We finished with a breakfast dessert of pancakes with whip cream and chocolate syrup topped with strawberries and bananas. Needless to say, our group devoured the whole thing! Overall, this place is an excellent establishment. I love that it's been under new ownership for over 5 years, because it shows! Staff is super attentive, courteous and the food was reasonably priced and large portions. Two thumbs up!!!"<//Review>< Pictures>

I am extremely happy that they changed owners. The food is excellent and this restaurant is apart of HISTORY! It sucked that the Sugar Mill owner was destroying this popular place. Finally someone else stepped in and bought this amazing place. Breakfast is limited but its

BREAKFAST! Lunch and dinner is better and worth spending. The burgers and the fries are super yummy. Best place to relax, chat with friends, and eat. The wait staff maybe older but they're on point when it comes to giving you everything you need unlike some other places.<//Text>

<Text>I ordered hot wings. I didn't realize they came with fries. I also ordered a Pellegrino. I received part of my order. There was only one Pellegrino left, it was hot. I declined that. ( NOT a problem) but I waited on hot fries NOT the chicken. The chicken was not freshly cooked. I ended up throwing the the majority of food away. A WASTE. I'm SUPPOSED to have hot fries. I don't care about a wait, I want my food correct. And hot in spice and heat is how I prefer my HOT wings.< /Text>< pictures>

Friendly, quick, and easy to get to. Not too sweet and good size cups for the price. Nice blend to the smoothies.<//review>

The coffee here is excellent and the house made syrups add a nice level of sweetness and flavor to their cold brews. I tend to prefer my coffee black, but I do appreciate the flavor options. They are open for take out and delivery during quarantine, I highly recommend supporting this small business during this time<//review>

Prices have gone up pretty dramatically from pictures shown. The high price could be reasonable if this was a high end specialty boba shop. But it is not. Its a no frills simple drink that was previously priced appropriately, now its not.

Look elsewhere for high end boba.

Look elsewhere for no frills budget boba.< /text>

If there is one thing I hate us a place that deny's a person their restroom because I didn't purchase anything. I was passing by and needed so urgently to use it. Had they allowed me to use their restroom I might considered buying something and they would have gained a new customer. However, that isn't the case. Sorry 😒<//text>

Everyone loves boba! Eat somewhere nearby, like at Madang Mall, and grab a boba for dessert and chill there. It's a nice place to relax and digest.<//review>

Love our worker Lisa she a funny girl. In always talk to her customer.when having bad day she will try in make you laugh. As for the owner he look a little grumpy at times but you just got to get to know him sweetest guy ever. As for the prices on food I believe there a little high but so worth it. The fact that the owner support our school say alot about him. The women in the cooking department can get a little slow some times but it only cause people need under stand orders are being place over the phone so relax they work just as hard. Only thing I want know is why don't they have flavor coffee creamer?</text>

Horrible customer service experience. Store clerk became upset as I was searching for Dos XX and Mango Cart for several minutes in the beer section. (Maybe he thought I was stealing?) I asked if he could assist me, I was met with attitude and ultimately told they did not have these items and asked to shop elsewhere. If possible, I would advise other consumers to shop at the nearby Laton Market. They were friendly and very helpful.<//text>

I've been coming to this store almost daily for the last 16 years and within that time their deli's went thru a few changes until it has become what it is today, which is a full on star quality place to order food from especially breakfast burritos! You will have to look long and hard to find a better breakfast burrito around here than the ones these lady's make, they're good and they're Huge! The food here is excellent and for them being only place here that's even selling food anymore they could be pricey if they wanted and we'd still pay but it's not it's actually pretty standard. All the guys working there right now are really nice they don't rip me off and they're not all creepy... (Like a store nearby that shall remain nameless, if you're female and you've gone to it then you know!)< /text>

Sometimes the store bathroom was really dirty. Also the prices are too expensive. Sometimes the cashiers are rude and don't give the right amount of change I had to ask for the right change. Also prices very i tested this myself I purchased 1 soda and a pack of gum and it was $3 and the next month I purchased the same think and it was $5. Sometimes i think that the cashiers just make up their own prices< /text>

I saw him enter the price for my food then added $1.00. When I asked what the dollar was for, he pointed to a sign and said "$0.80 ATM fee". When I asked why he charged $1.00, he got defensive and repeated "$0.80 ATM fee". Didn't feel like arguing through the language barrier. The food is good. I probably won't completely stop coming here. Just watch out if you don't have cash.</review>< Name>

Edit: Food has gotten pretty bad lately.

Edit 2021: Food is a little better, but the Krispy chicken got me sick twice.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>Went by today walking around looking for a car. Found one I liked, but it didn't have a price just a KBB value on the sticker so we went inside to ask price. Guy told me that's now how it works that they service people with bad credit. I asked how much a specific car was cash, he said.. "See the KBB value then double it" Really? Cash? And they charge you DOUBLE the value of the car. They are absolutely terrible. Stay away. They literally just prey on the weak or people who need help and have no choice. They were going to charge $12K for a car worth HALF the price. STAY AWAY!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Got my score up nearly 200 points. I was approved for $0.00 down. Credit was still considered fair but they still took a chance on me. Thank you so much. As of today made every payment so far and hopefully will have this car paid off in a year or less.</review>< Pics>

Miguel Hernandez here at CarHop National City was fantastic.... The customer service was 100% satisfying from the time that I called him until the time we walked out of the office. He was able to get us into a vehicle that my husband and I liked and with reasonable payments. I recommend anyone that has bad credit or no credit to come here for their next purchase. We will be coming back when we are reach to update.
We ended up choosing a 2012 Chevy Malibu.<//Text>

Instead of leaving with a car today I left carhop frustrated and upset. I came back to this place 3 times. I waited for 4 hrs for nothing. As far as them trying to finance you. Make sure you ask d a lot of questions because they really won’t tell you anything unless you ask. You don’t get to choose choose your  own vehicle they choose it for you base on  your credit and no down payment and top of it the y will bill you bi weekly which I wasn’t told when I first visited this place. So add that together $197 bi weekly that equals to $394 a month. Cars are not worth paying that much because I have never paid a car for that much on a car ever! The advertisement they have posted on the wall is a lie. They don’t work hard to help you with they don’t care they won’t even try to negotiate With you if you disagree then goodbye. They could careless. There are many places out there that can help you and truly work hard and not let you leave without a car and mind you to pay off more than $8000 on the vehicle they chose for me with broken ac is plain BS! Don’t be too desperate to get a vehicle because you will end up having issues with a car and then pay more out of your pocket for service . Be smart! I was very disappointed in this place.< /Text>

<Review>I came to CarHop looking for a good deal on a used car and Miguel was amazing. Miguel took the time to find the right car and the right deal for me. He did not beat around the bush or try to haggle with me. Miguel was very upfront with everything including each car and every detail with it. Miguel found the best car to suit me and my needs and my budget. I am very satisfied with my purchase and the great friendly and honest customer service that Miguel has provided. I am happy with my decision of coming to CarHop and I am thankful I had Miguel working with me as my sales representative.</Review>< Rating>

<review>Nadine was great! She is so professional and knowledgeable. No haggling, no wasting time. They tell you which cars you qualify for... you pick your car and your out the door. Warranty is good and a 7 day test drive with a money back guarantee. Best car buying experience we’ve ever had.

I’m a first time buyer and this experience was the best and more than what I hoped for all thanks to Miguel! He explained everything clearly and answered every single question and concern of mines. I would’ve came sooner if I knew it was this easy of a process. I definitely am a happy customer!< /Review>

10/10 customer service! Highly recommend this place. I was in a financial bind and needed a car quick and didn’t have the best credit. Nadine Jessen helped me out and got me in a car that day for a really good deal. She was very informative and gave really good customer service. :))<//Review>

Jorge made my car buying experience easy and enjoyable.  I bought a 2004 Toyota Camry with no money down.  After being sold a car that broke down two days later, coming into Carhop was my last option.   I am very relieved and looking forward to my credit building while I make my payments.  My car should last a lot longer than I'll be making payments for especially with the transmission, driving axle and engine covered under warranty for 18 months.  I am so relieved to have a reliable car with a great warranty that gets good gas mileage.  Carhop is the way to go. Ask for Jorge!</Review>

<Text>CarHop is a way to go! Miguel Hernandez has been a very great help. Walked in determined to walk out with a car and he definitely helped me out with that. I’ve been trying to get a car for so long and today is the day I get to drive home in a new car! 10/10 would recommend to friends and family.<//Text>< GmapID>

I was in desperate need of a car so I took a chance here. I wasn’t expecting much but Jorge took care of me. I walked out with a car the same day. They offer cars with any kind of credit so definitely worth checking out. I appreciate Jorge’s honesty and initiative to help me find a suitable car.</Review>

If you need a car with a warranty that covers engine transmission they got you. No other place offers what they offer and to be honest if you need a second chance in life and a car to get around and by making on time payments my credit will get better that is what I care about. If you don’t care about what car you get as long as its a car that will get you off the bus and from paying Uber carhop is the place! Thank you carhop!< /Review><date>1578023110417<//date>< Name>

<Review>Today, I came into CarHop in National City to purchase a vehicle.  I was greeted by Nadine J., who immediately began to help me with the process of buying from CarHop.  The process took a total of one hour and through the experience, Nadine, was friendly, informative, and most of all, very professional!  Honestly speaking, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but ultimately, MY expectations were GREATLY exceeded by Nadine and the total car buying experience at CarHop, National City, CA.  Whether you're a first-time car buyer, or have purchased many vehicles, I'd, not only recommend CarHop, but I'd suggest that Nadine be your sales advocate with the process.  I'm very pleased with the CarHop experience!  Thank you so much for everything, Miss Nadine!  You were an exceptional Sales person and I'm happy to say that, YOU'VE gained another satisfied buyer today!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

Laura from Carhop saved my life. 2 years ago, I lost my father to Cancer, Lost my Job, and couldn't keep my finances in check. I was homeless and living from weekly hotels to weekly hotels. I wasn't sure if I was ever going to be able to have a car again. I promised myself that things would get better. After 1 1/2 years of perseverance, I am current now stable with my living arrangements. I was able to get a job 1 block away from my Apartment, and have worked here for a year now. When I called Laura back to see if I can get a car again, she answered, "Yes", and to come in! When I got there, I was still skeptical, I may have given the person greeting me a little bit of attitude. Only because I was so nervous because every time I get a Yes, there's always a "but," or flat No. They helped me choose from 4 different Cars! I eventually found the one I loved. I cannot thank Laura and the Staff at Carhop enough. You all have truly, given me a new sense of confidence in Life. Thank you!< /Text>

I saw the Carhop commercial on TV and was very skeptical, you see two weeks ago I went to one of those stadium used car sales and came home empty handed. Wow! Nadine is a great asset to your company with her professional and polite service, one word knowledgeable, giving me the information about the process step by step at the beginning and following through on what she told me keeping in line with what said on the commercial. Well I will definitely will refer Carhop to everyone I can. Service was excellent and help from the staff to back it up. Keep up the good work Nadine, as a disabled veteran Carhop has given me very good start!!!  Mike, San Diego</review>

Not one place in a thousand miles radius would approve me.......

Except for Carhop. Laura went above and beyond to serve us. At first I was nervous casue it did take about 5 hours to do all the paperwork and do the process but in the end she came walking out with keys and paperwork in hand for us. I was expecting to throw 500 down but ended up driving away with no down payment to my surprise. And the payments are low! It's true what the reviews say guys, hop on down to Carhop. You won't be disappointed. Ask for Laura<//Text>

I came not really expecting to get a car, then I met Jorge. Which made me feel comfortable and a promising comfort that I was meant to get my car from here. I am so thankful that Jorge was there to answer all my questions and help me find the car I been searching for. Thanks to CarHop my family has transportation</Review>

Very honest, helps you see the big picture.

<Text>I have never shopped at Car Hop I took a customer there gave her lots of info not to get taken advantage of and some pointers on things she should ask for. My last job was 14 years at Landrover San Diego. I quit in 2014 no more jobs for me. I read the reviews and most are good that's not easy in a car business. So for now I have no reason to not give them a 5 star rating.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Thank you for Carhop and the sales agent Miguel Hernandez. I appreciate working with you once again and this will be the second car i’ve had with carhop. It is true that no one works very hard to get you into a vehicle but this people. I know there may be some bad reviews about them but honestly they are good working with you getting a car, not like other dealerships they get you all hyped up letting you test drive a car and ended up asking for more “Downpayments”. For those of you wanting to work getting your credit improved, I highly recommend Carhop to give them a try. trust me, I’ve been there before.

Goodluck!</text>

Such a great experience! I totalled my car and they were able to get me into something even better! Luke was so nice and professional and Tonya, the manager, bent over backwards to take care of me and help me during a very trying situation. No other dealership would do what they did for me today. SO BLESSED!! Thanks again, Carhop!<//text>

Not only did I get the exact car that I asked for with a 0 down payment; but the service I received from Laura, Jorge, and the underwriter Dan specifically made my whole visit feel extremely worthwhile. I thought I would never get approved and they did everything they could to get me in a Lexus truck!! Hands down best team of people ever and the best dealership. All of my future vehicle shopping will be done at carhop no where else. I’m recommending carhop to everyone that needs a car with no money down.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The salesman Jorge Soriano is very helpful and good at what he does! I have poor credit and he got me a very low down payment, and weekly payments and now I'm driving away in  a very nice car. The wait was a couple of hours, but he didn't leave me hanging during the wait and checked on me frequently. Very nice staff and I would recommend this place to anyone I know! Thanks CarHop!<//Text>

Going through some tough times I needed a nice, safe and reliable car. Most importantly affordable. CarHop team and Tania were so incredibly helpful. They got me into a nice car. Ford Focus. They explained everything to me. They weren't pushy or tried to get me into something I couldn't afford. The process was pretty quick. I highly recommend CarHop for anyone seeking a great used car with flexible payment terms. Very happy with my experience here.<//text>

Jorge really helped me out. It's been twice I've came here and always good service from Jorge. Only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the very limited options of cars that they have. That's all. Could also be a bit more well maintained. Other than that,good service and a reliable car.<//Review>

Jorge was most helpful today. Helped me get a great deal on a car and was honest about the prices. There was no pressure to sell and let me know about the seven day satisfaction guaranteed. I'm happy about this purchase.

I had no credit and I'll be able to improve my credit with the loan that they gave me.<//review>

<Review>Came in today to go put a down payment on a car. Had a few options to look at after i was approved. Jorge helped me out and told me if i had a bit more money for a down payment a few more options would open up. I gave a certain price and he was actually able to work with me on the car i had my eyes on for a while, and now I'm walking out with my mazda 3 that ive been wanting. So glad i came to this place and had Jorge to help me out with everything.<//Review><Date>1561842875779</Date><user>100075371057082603285</user><Rating>5</Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_name>

All vehicles have a generic image of the similar vehicle,
No mileage or prices on anything, I had emailed them for details they didn’t answer any of my questions and kept trying to get me to come in. I feel like I rather do my research and know what I’m buying before anything.
If they would only communicate better with their customers.</Review>

Bought a car in late December of 2018, had to get the engine replaced in March, now there’s  another issue with the catalytic converter, which needs to be replaced. I don’t recommend coming to this place unless you want to be stuck paying for a car that you continuously have to fix.  You’ll spend more money fixing the car than what’s it worth. Keep looking & never settle on this place.<//Review>

<Text>My experience here at Carhop was nothing next than great. Jorge was the salesman who helped me and he made getting into my next car really easily. He was completely transparent on the process letting me know exactly what to expect in buying a used car. He took is time and didn’t rush or try to make a quick sell and that made me feel completely at ease. I don’t have the best credit history and coming here was my best option in getting a car & fixing my credit in the process. If you’re looking for a good used car with a great salesman, come here and ask for Jorge. He will be straight up and not bs you ! Thanks Again !!!<//Text>< pictures>

I did not experience anything pleasant at this location. Seeing recent complaints, I’ve decided to voice mine. We come in, we aren’t greeted, and we wait. A rude lady comes and calls us in, isn’t friendly, isn’t kind. It was overall the worst experience. Also, buy from an actual lot, your payments will be much cheaper. I now own a 2017 for $300 a month opposed to some of their outrageous payments. Skip car hop. It’s called car hop because you should hop right over it and search elsewhere. Please don’t tell me to contact you, I have no interest, I’m much happier elsewhere. If I can save one person from this company; then I did my job.< /review>

<text>Very pleasant and professional sales person named Jorge, glad I came here. Here it is 9 months later and I had pretty major mechanical problem and Laura the manager at the National City lot was major in getting my car repaired. Thank you so much.< /text>< pics>

Luke did a great job. Very professional. He is best professional I've ever seen.
He is the best when it come to paperwork.  he is kind and easy to do business with and a great smile please come and see  him. I think he should own his own dealership.</review>

They want $800 down and we were shown 1 car. It was filthy! A cup holder is full of cigarette ashes. Another cup holder had a glob of something idek what it is. Hair all over. Hair tye, candy wrappers and someone's body spray. Not impressed 👎 business ethics to push the sale of a filthy car.  Extremely poor selection.<//Review>

As someone who's credit is not the best I really didn't know how carhop could help me. I'm not going to lie, it was an all day process, but Miguel Hernandez found me a decent car for my budget. He put me in a safe reliable car I can say with a smile "it's mines". Thank you carhop I will be sure to tell everyone I know to come get their car from you.<//review>

Came in super nervous and anxious because i knew my credit wasnt the best but i also knew i didn't want to have a monthly payment that was the same price as my rent.  Luke was a huge help and got me a great deal. i was able to test drive and inspect each vehicle that i qualified for.  the staff was amazing and extremely nice.  i would definitely recommend coming here for someone who is trying to build their credit back up!<//Text>

I'm so lucky to find a place that would give me a 4th chance.  Especially with my credit and my history with car loan places but luckily I found Carhop and the people are super friendly and helpful.  The only thing I have to say and why I didn't give them 5 stars is they need more workers you have to wait a long time cause one guy is helping 5 people at time. Meaning your time there might be 4 to 6 hours.  However with that being said everything else was excellent.  Thanks for those who got me back in the driver's seat.</Review>

CarHop was awesome! I came in with not a whole lot to give or very good credit.  Lani explained the process to me and gave it to me straight no BS.  I was happy to know she had something for me I could use.  And with warranty!! Thank you for making this an easy process, you have truly helped me out a great deal!  See Lani and her awesome manager!< /review>

I had a wonderful experience at carhop, I was helped by Nadine Jessen. She was very pleasant to deal with, and she got me in a nice and clean 06 chrystler 300 with no hassle in a very professional manner. I appreciate carhop and the expeditious business i received from them today and i would recommend them to anyone needing a car. Come in to their National City location and ask for Nadine she will get you in a car no doubt!!!</review>

I was turned down everywhere for one reason or another, poor credit, not big enough down payment, credit score too low, not enough time on my job, you name it. Carhop told me to come back at the end of the month and I did. They were very up front and knowledgeable, treated me with respect unlike other car dealers and just when I thought I was never going to get into a car, THEY SOLD ME ONE! THEY HAD ME COME OUTSIDE AND HAD IT RUNNING WITH THE LIGHTS ON DOOR OPEN, HEATER GOING (it was cold that evening) AND BASICALLY SAID HERE  IS YOUR NEW CAR! Lani was very helpful and pleasant to speak with, The new saleswoman that was in training (wish I remembered her name!) was professional and genuine Thank you.Tanya was knowledgeable, very upbeat and positive making my experience fantastic! I feel  good to be re-establishing my credit and that CARHOP gave me a chance! The price and monthly payment reasonable. They want me to succeed!  I will recommend your company and what it stands for every chance I get! THANK YOU CARHOP FOR MAKING BUYING A CAR A GOOD EXPERIENCE!< /text>

Awesome experience! When I thought I didn't have a chance somehow they were able to approve me and even helped me save some money. Definitely, recommend Car Hop to anyone and everyone looking for another chance to get a car and work on building your credit to get back on track. Thank you Laura and Tonya!< /review>

Thanks Luke! You're awesome.( I wanted to edit because it honestly hadn't sunk in how great everything was) Luke got me really good payments on the car, the car is amazing and couldn't have asked or imagined anything better for my situation. Really busy on saturday so everyone ended up helping me out, you guys are life savers for real. You walk away feeling truly helped not taken which is almost unheard of in sales.</review>

I was desperately in need of a vehicle, unfortunately my credit is pretty bad. I couldn't get approved anywhere... I heard Carhop was a good place for bad credit financing. Even they said NO! But Jorge understood my situation. He and his manager Laura worked with an underwriter to help me get approved.  Honorata, Jorge and Laura stayed an hour and a half after closing to get me a car that I feel comfortable with. I couldn't be any happier! Thanks a lot Carhop of National City. You guys are the best< /text>

<text>I am so greatful for Carhop. They saved my family's life. We were blessed to have the opportunity to meet some great staff. Jorge was awesome with us. He worked with us. My credit is very bad and they still put me in a car within my budget and that fits my large family. Brianna was awesome also. I recommend this place to everyone who is having a problem getting a car. 5 Stars for Carhop in National City!!!< /text>< pics>

Don't buy a car from this place, you will be stuck in a contract with a broke down car me and my brother bought cars around the same time both with endless problems. Please don't waste your money.  Save money for a down payment at a better dealership this one's very shady after you are locked in a contract. Don't do what we did .<//text>

Luke handled everything in a timely manner like a seasoned car salesman. Come to find out it was his first week. . . I was so shocked and impressed I had to write a review. . .< /review>

A lot of people will just do what they have to for  their own financial sub stance but Jorge made us feel very comfortable with giving it another chance. Being able to make a decision and knowing someone’s gonna work with you is the best comfort. Thank you Jorge for not beating around the bush & great customer service .< /text>< Pictures>

I love carhop. I got my first car from them. Had it for a year an a half. And now I got a up. They work hard to get you in a car and if your due for an upgrade they try there best to put you in a bigger or better car. Love you carhop! You really helped me.</Review>

Such an AMAZING experience got a car for 0 down payments reasonable. Don and Tanya really helped me out by contacting the bank to get the car for 0 down. Bonus I get to built my credit up what other dealership does that. I HIGHLY recommend carhop all of the staff are super friendly and if needed to they will stay after hours to help you out. Everyone should come here.</text>

<text>Wow. Words cannot describe how grateful I am for Laura! She really made it happen for me! I came to Carhop one year ago and wasn't able to get into a vehicle. But I said I will work hard and be able to come back. One year later I came back to the best customer service I've ever experienced! Laura's kind and caring words as well as determination helped me get a CAR!!! If you are looking for a place where they will do everything they can and with a smile, come here! Now I can start living my life and enjoy the reason I moved here to San Diego! THANK YOU LAURA AND CARHOP TEAM! You guys made me feel so welcomed! I am honored to be your customer!</text><pictures>None</pictures><date>1448759800891<//date>< userid>

I highly recommend coming here if you have been denied at numerous car lots. They were determined to help me and get me into a car despite the issues with my credit. And after applying twice and getting denied, I came back a third time after doing what was suggested and I am getting ready to drive off in my car. Tonya was extremely helpful and very patient/understanding of my situation. She was a great help and I'm glad to be a customer of carhop!< /Review>

Lani was very efficient and descriptive about the details of purchasing a vehicle from car hop. She exhibited warmth, smile and genuine concern about me leaving the premises today driving. I would buy a car from her again and I will refer friends and associates to ask for Lani when coming to car hop. She showed that she is compassionate and will get the job done. You have a quality employee.< /text>

<review>I walked in with low hopes b/c my credit is So low but am walking out with a new (to me) car and a 0 down payment. Definitely exceeded my expectations and were super friendly !

UPDATE 1/18/19
This is my 2nd time shopping with carhop. I came in to trade in the car I had previously purchased and Jorge S was the absolute best. He worked super hard to get me a car 9 yrs newer than my old one and for 0 down. They are a bit expensive but with poor credit history and little money for a down payment they really do their best to help you out.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I went in hoping for the best because of all their good reviews but the lady that assisted me had 0 interest in helping me. I had been declined but she didnt try to help me with alternate options at all. We went to the car dealer next door and they helped me right away and I got approved with them because they tried different methods to help me get approved and didnt quit the first try like these guys. Overall a bland experience. The worker was just not into helping me.</Text>

He was very professional, caring,and understanding.I didnt feel rushed, nor did I feel like he was just trying to make a sale. At one point I even said they should have more salesmen and women like him. Overall my experience with Car Hop was one of the best I've ever had...Thank you JORGE, Tanya, and Luke

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Came in here for an upgrade on my car. Jorge helped me with everything. Made everything easy, explained everything throughly, saw the car's history and tried to do everything in his power to give me the best deal. If you come in, ask for Jorge. He was honest and catered to my needs. Thanks Jorge.

So, this is an update and edit on this place. Getting the car was so awesome and smooth. Super fast and they did everything for me. However. After I got the car, was making timely payments, the car started to give me trouble. And I mean, one thing after another, things would go so wrong. I dumped over $3000 into the car, trying to fix everything on it. I called the dealership, and told them what was going on, they didn't care. They were rude, treated me like I was an animal. I asked for payment extensions, because I was always having my car worked on. They cut off my car through the starter interrupt, and stranded me over $70 dollar missed payment. I had to bypass the starter interrupt, just so I would not be stranded 50 miles from my home. They emailed me nasty letters, which I saved, because I was going to take them to court. The car finally died on me, refusing to start, the whole car system dying on me. I begged and pleaded and asked to trade my car in for another car, and I would continue to make payments. They didn't care. They only wanted their money. So after my car died, I let my car sit, and left the GPS on the car on, and left them come take it. Even up to the moment they took the car, they hounded me to make the payments. They wrote nasty emails and left messages on my phone, which I finally had enough. I finally bought a brand new car, through Kia of El Cajon. Awesome, awesome car. Do not ever, under any circumstances, go to this dealership. They are a fraud. There are ways to get a better car and a better deal than this scam.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I am so so thankful that I was able to walk away with a car today. I walked in thinking I wasnt going to get approved at all because I  got denied by every dealership.
They were able to work with my credit score and let me tell you it is very poor. But let me tell you I got approved and I want to say a very Big Thank You to Jorge!!! Now I get to provide for my daughter and continue working.<//review>

The website says that credit checks aren't needed but they do run it. Depending on credit they will limit you on what options you have to get from the lot. The one option that was given to me was not detailed and very dirty.< /Review>

<Review>Great experience here.  My former vehicle was almost 18 years old and finally gave out due to a faulty repair where I was left with little in savings and received under $1000 for the value of the vehicle.  I looked up carhop and decided to head down to look at what they had to offer.
Jorge was the gentleman who helped me and he did a great job.  He presented the process of how the company operates and set expectations at the beginning of the interaction.  He even gave me possibilities of the vehicles I could be approved for before we even ran my credit and was pretty much spot-on with what I qualified for after the fact.  Jorge was extremely patient while I test drove the vehicles to make a decision and made me not feel pressured about one vehicle over the other which I greatly appreciated.
In the end, I left with a vehicle that was much better than what I expected and I definitely recommend this place to anyone who needs a pre-owned vehicle and is looking for a good value.  Ask for Jorge, he’s really great!< /Review>< resp>

< Review>
My name is Christian Ramirez I spent 8 months with Hyundai sonata 06 before I traded it in for an Kia forte Fe 20 from team Kia of El cajon which by the way would recommend more than carhop. In the last 8 months I paid alot in repairs, I found rust on my oil, I had to change battery in less than a month, tires didn't even last 3 months, rotors were used up and breaking pads were old and rusty too, right axles was like if they weilded two parts together making one axles which it still made a weird noise two months after i lease the car. The trunk only closed when it felt like it, interior I found sticky old candy under the seats and broken parts hidden by the doors, the name sonata kept falling letter by letter. They also tell you if any occurrence should happen that u can't make a payment u can call in and they can help you out with an extension or something, but that's a lie my first late payment was 5 months after I leased the car and they didn't gave me a chance they told me if I didn't make my payment soon they were going to disconnect my starter, which by the way it sounds more of a threat than a lending hand. I came in with the need of a vehicle and they took advantage, Nadine was my sales person she was new during the time but she knew how to take advantage of the situation, they act like they care but they only care for that signature. For future buyers I recommend you give team Kia of El cajon a try before coming here to carhop.</Review>

My car literally broke down yesterday and today Laura, with some assistance from Jorge, helped me get back on the road in one sitting. I’m super thankful. I highly recommend this place !<//text>

I had a pretty decent experience. I’ve been here several times before, however, this is my first time actually purchasing a vehicle. Jorge was nice, professional, and was as honest as he could be without harming the business lol. He was extremely patient with me as I made a lot of request because I’m slightly picky. I didn't give 5 stars because some of the information changed on a vehicle that I really wanted, HOWEVER, I’m walking out with a nice car and an overall great experience. Let me just add, don’t take everyone’s negative experiences and think it’s always like that. While I was in the office I had someone tel me they’re crooks and so on and so forth, however, people tend to get really upset when they can’t have their way. 🤷🏾‍♀️<//Text>

With bad credit and low down they still where able to get me off the bus and into a car. Go in with low standards and don't expect to leave in a Bently if you have bad credit and no down. But they work hard to get you into something in your budget. Be open minded and prepare for a lil wait time and the experience will be a good one.. Thanks guys for working with me when no one else would.</Review>

My friend got approved with a credit score of 390 and $900. DUIs and bankruptcy’s. I brought 1,200 worth of income and a higher score over 560 , no bankruptcy’s or accidents and was denied. Literally the worst place and I hope nobody comes here.< /review>

<Review>Jorge was not only paitent with me, but he helped me understand the system of how CarHop works. I came in Saturday of November 17 with no experience of buying a car off the lot. They help you with no or bad credit which was a big plus for me. Now I am driving off the lot with my new car November 19.

I had the BEST experience!! Tanya was very optimistic that she would be able to help me get financed from the outset, even though I have terrible credit and had been turned down elsewhere.  I was in desperate need of transportation,  because I can't afford to miss work and Car Hop made it happen in one day! And I only had to put $100 down! I'm definitely recommending everyone I know to Car Hop!< /Review>

Didn't see that coming! I honestly thought with all the bad reviews that my time was going to be wasted but Tonya helped me through the long process of car buying and I would say that she deserves all the recognition possible 5 stars on her customer service, effort, friendliness, professionalism! She guided me step by step always keeping informed. Thank you again for such a wonderful experience Tonya Javadi!</text>

I Bought A Nice Car From Here . My Car Was Towed Due To Them Mixing The Vin Number With Another Car On Their Lot And The Vin # On My License Plate Didnt Match The Vin # On My Car , I Went The Next Day To Get That Issue Fixed . About A Month Later They Were Telling Me I Had To Redo Vehicle Registration At The DMV . I Typically Work Overnight So I Sleep Through The Day , I Finally Decided To Lose My Sleep To Go Sit At a the DMV , Once I got There The People At The DMV Stayed That My Title Had The Wrong Car Listen But Had My Vin # On Their . Once Again , A Problem That Was Not My Fault. I Still Haven’t Received My Hard Plates And It’s Been 3 Months Since I’ve Had The Car And 3 Weeks Since Redoing My Registration.</review>

< Review>
This is my second time coming to CarHop. My first experience allowed me the opportunity to increase my credit score significantly enough to where I was able to purchase a brand new car after a year! A car accident left me without a car and I have returned to a very warm welcome. I have to say that if you truly need help purchasing a vehicle and are having a hard time finding someone to finance you, you definitely should stop by and talk to them. Thank you CarHop for hooking me up once again!<//Review>

My experience here was great. All of my questions and concerns were handled. My credit is pretty bad, so I was shocked when I was approved for my choice of vehicle. Tanya was great, as well as patient and I had a really good experience. I look forward to improving my credit big time, thanks to carhop and Tamya</text>

<review>I'd go someplace else to buy a car. Continually said that payments weren't made when they were made and in advance, no less. I'd get a call stating a late or missed payment and that the starter on my car would be disabled if I didn't immediately make a payment. Too much time wasted on the phone with their employees to rectify the situations because they were too lazy to look in the correct parts of their database.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Nicole definitely helped me all the way out today. Before coming here I left a dealership that claimed to be able to help me out regardless of the circumstance.  At the end of the visit they tried to put me in a car with almost 200,000 miles on it with a CRAZY monthly payment. I came to CarHop expecting the worst, and I'm pulling off the lot with the best car I've ever owned, all thanks to Nicole. It's been a rough week but after today, I think things are gonna start to look up. Thank you again Nicole! You the real MVP!!!!<//Text>

Man! This place definitely has its purpose. If you need a step in building your credit this is a good place to start. And the GM Tanya OMG!!!!this girl is in need of a clone. She's great a so efficient wearing evey hat in the office. She deserves a raise and a larger staff. But overall I had a good experience<//review>

So this company does not honor their limited warranty for the vehicles they sell. I took my mother 3 the very next day into one of their preferred shops. They waive the deductible fee they were gonna charge me for $75! Well thanks for that! My car is hitting metal to metal in the back on the back axle! And they were supposed to have ordered the part said the shop to me when they told me the reason why they didn't replace it when I took it to begin with. They couldn't even change the air filter on the car! God knows what they actually did because I believe they did nothing. Finally because I put a Google review online about car hop the manager Flash vice president  Called me for the very 1st time I got a call back actually. They had forgotten to order the part the auto part place ordered the park it came in on Friday a week ago due to my availability I was unable to go till today today! So I go there this morning 9:00 a.m. and I in there for about 45 minutes if that  They tell me my car is ready they show me the tires are kind of screwed up in the back I need to new back tires and reality I need 4 new tires  Cause they're all badd and I drive away and the same noise is happening this same metal to metal clanking in the back is happening the mechanic drove my car the very 1st day I took it and today and how the h*** does he not know what the problem is and why the h*** would he fix it is my question this company is awful  Stupid awful I can't even describe the anger and the  The disregard they have for the customers that pay out the a** for these pieces ship cars that they sell them this company doesn't even deserve one star so now I'm getting in trouble at work because I have to still continue to take my car back again to get it repaired because now they said they fixed the front axle but the noises in the back lol</Review>

Im highly impressed and satisfied with the customer service at car hop. My car sale person was Miss Nadine. She made my car buying experience a memorable one. She was fast, efficient and got me a great deal. Shes been by far the Best. I would defenetly recomend going to car hop and asking for Miss Nadine if youre in need of a car.

Thank you Miss Nadine< /Text>

<review>I had a great experience and Carhop today. My husband and I came in with zero down and I was able to leave SUV. I recommend this to everyone who's has a low credit score or bread credit  because they're still willing to work with you and it will also build your credit.<//review></record></dataset><record>

This review is for my skeptics...
If you are reading this review more than likely you dont have perfect credit and little or no down payment but need a reliable car. Long story short I was a skeptic myself. Like you i read almost ever review before making my decision. I previosuly bought a car off craigslist and to no surprise it has stopped working. I needed a car ASAP to get around in. I didnt want to settle for anything so here I am. I bought my car Saturday and took it to Midas Monday for an inspection. My 2005 Nissan Exterra is in perfect condition inside and out. Midas stated that the only thing I need to have looked at is what they are calling a blend door actuator. This is not a problem except is makes a noise when the car turns on but it will do no harm if not bolted down. Outside of getting new tires I need NO work done and I am very grateful for that. The cars they carry are from 2000 to 2014 so please dont go in with the mindset that you will walk out with something new. This place is great for people with troubled credit or no credit and low down payments. Best part off it will be paid off in 2 years!!!  Thank you guys for selling me a great car :)

PS: Go see Jorge...He will defintely take care of you. As he always say just be honest and they will be able to help .<//text>

< Review>
Sittin on my couch after working long hours and taking the bus for 2 hours carhop commercial comes up and i said i have to go try it. I was sick and tired of walking to work and taking uber and lyft was takibg all my money. i walked to carhop and leave with a car leave with an opportunity to help myself get better in life. no more blisters on my feet. Car Hop is a great program to help people drive. with bad credit and no money down i was approved. i can take my kids to school and no more walking. they are a blessing. thank you to the carhop team that made it possible. Jorge, Nadine, Laura you guys are the best! i recommend everyone tgat needs a car go to carhop they will help you!<//Review>

<Review>Luke, is a very professional salesman.  He made my whole car buying experience a pleasure,  with his jovial personality and his empathetic  anecotes.  I highly recommend CarHop, based on Luke's wonderful service.  This world needs more people like him!!!

Thank you soooo much Luke, may God continue to bless you and your family.  Keep up the excellent work, and thanks for a hand up and not a slap down.  You are the best, and 2018 will be a great year for you; because what you put out in this world does come back to you.  Positive vibes right back at ya!!!

Such an amazing experience over at CarHop National City, i went in with the mindset that i may not get approved due to getting a car repossessed in april but thankfully i was able to leave today with a ford escape i honestly cant believe it, but im so happy i cant thank Tonya enough for finding me exactly what i was looking for and putting in the time and effort to allow me to drive off the lot today!! I definitely recommend getting a car here especially if you have a low credit score and are also looking to rebuild your credit!<//text>

Haven't gone in yet however, is there a reason this place has 4.8 stars on Google and 1.5 stars on Yelp? There's got to be something going on.

Will see when I go in.</review>

<review>When I bought my car almost 2 years ago now I was at the dealer for 8 hours. And well it honestly didn't feel like it. It wasn't their fault I was picky with my vehicle and of course waiting for aproval is always time consuming. And they were awesome. During the times I needed to wait on the finance department they were reassuring and even had a conversations with me just to keep me from loosing my mind. Haha Definitely a good company.</review>< Pics>

I am a first time buyer from a carlot, i was very nervous and anxious about it. Right away i was welcomed by a smiling face which at that point felt a bit more at ease. I was then seated and the ball was rolling. I had an amazing woman by the name of Megan help me out. Let me just say you want her on your side. She was just absolutely wonderful! Even with my very low credit score she worked with me and got me a BEAUTIFUL car that im more than happy to drive of the lot with. Thank you carhop! I will most definetly recommend this company to any and everyone looking for a reliable yet decent car. (many MANY options) & a special thank you to Megan i very much grateful for your time and services THANK YOU!!!!!!< /Text>

Financed a Mazda3 07.  Right off the lot it it had issues so I took it the very next day to one of there preferred mechanics.  They did some of the repairs and completely ignored the starting issue.  They also said they had to order parts.  And it's been almost 2 weeks and
I have been getting nothing but the run around.  I left a message with carhop in national city today and am still waiting for a call back.  They never call back tho... so far this company is all talk that there customer is #1 and all they SHOW is it's not!
And to carhop representatives, dont reply to this review with ur standard message that customer service in important...cuz it isnt! U should take better care of ur customers since u already overprice ur broke down vehicles...I'm sure u guys are making a lot of money selling cars u should appreciate that by taking care of us!

Just like I thought no one ever called me back and when I finally talked to the mechanic at the auto repair place  They told me that car op forgot to order the parts horrible customer service Horrible place to buy a car these people should be sued and out of business< /Text>

Got me a Toyota Camry, happy to be Helped and not treated bad.

Edit: after 6 months I would like to recall my review and thoughts on my purchase and carhops lack of customers service after you purchase. All was great for the wife for fist month till starter and alternator gave up, they got it fixed but then brakes started making noises, then battery gave out. After 6 months making auto pay on time, miss one time cause all 4 tires need change and have no money to pay they threatened to turn off car and won't be able to drive even with their miss a payment autopay.. Plus my credit score barely got updated with as many as 12 on time payments. All in all had bad experiences with a Lemon automobile from a two side dealership...I should pursue California Lemon Law on them selling such Messed up vehicle's. Not a happy customer for a 3,000$ car that I'm paying quadruple pay for it to need repairs monthly.< /Text><UserId.>102201276588277173640<//UserId.><pics>None</pics></record>

If you have terrible credit, you're guaranteed to get a car. They have a program that will help you rebuild your credit, this company is designed for credit building. Highly recommend.</review>

Horrible Customer service! My co worker just got a car from them a few months ago and last week it breaks down on the freeway. Luckily she still has a warranty to get it fixed. Anyway, the auto shop is saying they don't know how long its gonna take and The manager at Car Hop sounded rushed, unprofessional, & very careless. She then proceeds to say that she still needs to pay and they do not offer any loaner car to get to and from work. In other words they do not care that they sold a lemon car. My Co Worker had just referred me to them last month since i was car shopping. But i will defiantly stay away from CAR HOP. i just feel so bad for her. hope they do get it worked out for her though :/<//text>

<review>So you go in to get a car, and you get one which is a good thing. I'm sure many people had good experiences with car hop. But MINE, mine was not good. I was hoping to write a good review but I go in and 3 hours later after leaving the water pump bust and something with the engine. Took it THEIR mechanic next day, Saturday morning oct.6 even though it was overheating and smoking. I call week later to see whats happpening and they tell me i should have it back forsure Oct 16 monday. So i just finally get a call back oct.19 (today) saying they just got the piece yesterday. Why didn't I get a call then if I'm a worried customer?! But all in all, in the call they said i won't get it till oct. 25. Two and half weeks to wait for a couple parts, and worse thing is i missed a bunch of work since I'm a delivery driver. I had a busted car and that's why I came to a dealership, so I don't have to worry about nothing being broken. Guess not. I hope everyone else has a good experience at least. Sorry car hop, I'm not gonna right a good review if it ain't deserved.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Great expierence here at car hop. I had a repo on Tuesday and on Friday I had a car. It wasn't brand new like my Kia Soul but it was better than walking. Tonya was really great and very honest with me. I got into a Chevy Impala and I love it. I really should not even be in a car but thanks to car hop I can drive in a car instead of asking for rides, taking a bus, or wasting money on uber all the time. Thanks Tonya 😊😍< /text><gmap_id>0x80d952400d234b27:0x49dfc7c1a837013e</gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>5< /Rate><Time>1469227421204</Time><response>None< /response><UserId.>114711118621638993050</UserId.>< user_name>

<date>1467491625752</date><rate>1< /rate><Review>I purchased a Ford expedition 6 days ago I only drove it home and to and from the grocery store. ..last night I drove it to Alpine just 40 miles east of San Diego. The engine made an aweful sound and started running rough so I pulled off to have a look. I checked the oil and there was white film around the oil cap thick like butter. I asked a gentleman who worked there and he said it probably has a blown head casket. That the white substance is water in the oil. I am documenting this so I can get my less than 7 day money back guarantee. I will give a better review if they keep to thier promise of a money back guarantee. I would give them 0  Stars right now. Teresa Russell San Diego...

Well they fixed it. A week and a half later. They did push back my car payment a month. To compensate for the taxis I had to take, home from where it broke down and to the shop to pick it up. Not counting numerous other uber rides.

Well its a month later... My engine has overheated two times in a 2 week period . ....for IAlso had to take it in for the air conditioning. ..it stopped working. Now its time to make a payment.  I cant even depend on this car to make it out of the drive. Well back to the shop. They informed me the wouldnt push back the payment again... I get it.Duh.... 6 days would be money back quarentee....2 months Im screwed. Jeez!!!!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<rating>3<//rating><text>Laura was so great in helping me and my boyfriend. Its our first time getting a new car and they explained everything. Its really a great first experience and recommend anyone to come here. Thank You CarHop.
--4months later.. We had a recent problem with our car, of course my boyfriend isnt much of a great english speaker and needs help to understand a few things but at least HELP not TELL him the things he has to do , go thru the process and actually Help . I het that webonly get 30days in the beginnig but what about after , after what was supposebly FIXED was the problem we were back for AGAIN.. and i read a review on here saying these reviews are fake of course not , reason why there are all GOOD reviews is because they have us put down a review the FIRST day we purchase a car there , OF COURSE they get good reviews we got a car! Where are the reviews of the complaints AFTER the purchase, we have heard multiple. We are just one out of many im sure. Still consider Laura as a really good help. But still thanks Carhop i mean we still got the car but be more HELPFUL please.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Text>Changing my review, after 6 days I took my car for a check up for a grinding noise it was making, come to find out there were no pads left on the car, the rotors were bad and the gasket was blown. Before I got the car I mentioned a burning smell to Jorge and he said that's just how old cars smell, did not mention anything about the gasket. Had to wait a couple hours to find out that they approved to cover the cost even though it wasn't covered by the warranty and they said they didn't have to cover the parts but they were still going to. Upset that they sold me a car that was unsafe in the first place, no have to miss work and try to find a ride because my cars going to take 2 days, finance company says "things happen" and we are still expecting the first payment, girl was rude as hell and lied to me about my account manager calling me. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because they're covering the parts but beware about the car your getting. Also get it checked on your test drive so your sales person doesn't lie to you smh. They also tell you to write a review after completing your paperwork when they know your happy, that's why they probably have good reviews. Not a lot of people come back to edit their post. Also good luck trying to speak with your account manager after you have problems because you will only go in a circle.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Carhop has been a god send in my time of need, They are understanding to my circumstances, while i have tried other dealers that were unproductive for me Carhop was excellent, not to mention Luke Vogel Carhop Representative and Tonya- National city branch manager who was kind, professional, and courteous, I would recommend Carhop to anyone who deserves a second chance.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

The positive reviews on here have GOT to be fake by their own employees or others CarHop has paid to write them ... just search on Google for "CarHop Complaints" ... there are numerous complaints from all locations in the USA where CarHop operates ... I'm surprised that States Attorneys-General have not yet filed a case against them ...< /review>
