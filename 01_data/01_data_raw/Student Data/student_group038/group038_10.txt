< Review>
My wife and I are beyond happy with our experience today at Mattress Firm. We were greeted immediately by Kayla who was exceptionally nice and informative on the different mattress types they had to try out. We had no pressure on us to purchase a mattress but with the great sales going on and customer service we were sold and can’t wait to enjoy our new Cal King bed! Thank you again for making our shopping enjoyable and we will be back in the future!< /Review>

<Review>I came in knowing that I wanted a mattress but was unsure what I could get in my price range. Eldridge was very helpful in my selection and gave me a great deal on a mattress. Will be recommending this place to all my friends and colleagues.< /Review>< Pics>

Eldridge Cisco was our sales guy and he was epic. Gave us all the info we wanted and then some.

I would have bought everything he showed me if I could've as it was tailored so well to our actual needs.

<review>We were taken care of by Tyler, and could not be happier nor more satisfied with his level of expertise and professionalism. He was very comfortable to work with from the start, and we never felt pressured nor influenced.
In fact, we walked in to the store intending to shop around a lot more, but were so happy with the product and Tyler's knowledge, that we went ahead and purchased our bed within an hour. You can't go wrong, go see Tyler!< /review>< rating>

<Review>What a fantastic experience. Tyler had us at “Tomorrow”—meaning the mattress could be delivered right away. Then he beat that and scheduled it for same day delivery!!! There was no hard sell or pushing us toward more expensive models. We visited a competing store earlier today and had the exact opposite experience. Felt like we were buying a used car, and their delivery was 4 to 6 weeks! We will definitely recommend this store to friends. Thanks, Tyler!</Review>< resp>

I was greeted at the door with excellent customer service. After I explained to them what I was looking for and why I was in the store. I got to experience and test drive every mattress in the store. With my own personal store provided pillow. I'm truly grateful that I went to that store and got to experience and learn about all the different mattresses. I look forward to many nights a restful sleep on my new mattress. Thank you JD</Text>

JD helped me but the other employee was extremely nice as well (sorry I forgot his name). I loved how JD asked questions about me and my husband's sleep patterns/positions, type of support we both like, if we sleep hot/cold, etc. He was so patient with me and wasn't pushy at all. The quality of products and customer service is an A+! Even though we spent more than intended, we got a bed completely tailored to both my husband and myself. I'm so happy! Thank you JD and Mattress Firm for giving us a good night's sleep we haven't had in a while!!< /Text>

JD was Awesome!  Great Customer Service and was very educational.  We ended up making a purchase that was well over our budget but and the end of the night I am sure we will be proud of our decision because of JD.

Nice work JD!  Keep up the good work!< /Review>

The representative that took my call was helpful to assure me he could help me find a pillow to fit my height & body size. I recommend mattress firm if you need a pillow. They have a good selection that targets specific needs and sleep positions. The representatives are extremely courteous & knowledgeable.<//review>

I walked in never having been to a Mattress Firm before, but after reading all the positive reviews, decided it was the right place for me to buy my mattress. I walked in with a vague idea of what I wanted and was assisted by Tyler, who started me off with something and then asked me narrowing questions to help me find out exactly what I wanted! He got me a great deal on not only my mattress but also a great bedframe as well. Can't wait to sleep on it when it's delivered in 2 weeks!</text>

I worked with Kayla Williams at the Rancho Cordova Mattress Firm store and she provided exceptional customer service; I couldn’t be happier!  As a first-time home buyer and a recent fire victim from my previous residence burning down in the LNU Complex Fire, I had a million questions about mattresses.  Kayla was kind, patient, and knowledgeable of all the different types of mattresses.  She explained the difference in  technologies of each mattress and the pros/cons of various brands. She allowed me to try out many different mattresses to ensure I find the bed that is appropriate for my back injuries. I bought a King mattress, full mattress, two sets of box springs and bed frames, two pillows, and sheets.  Kayla was patient and knowledgeable about ALL the products.  Secondly, she was able to schedule the delivery and installation of all the products within 72 hours.  Lastly, the store was very hygienic and practiced COVID safety protocols.  I would recommend Kayla and the Mattress Firm store in Rancho Cordova to anyone!< /text>

My wife and I brought a king size mattress from mattress firm approximately 3 months ago. My wife wanted to exchange it, because it wasn't as comfortable as expected. We went inside the store and met Eldridge. He was full of knowledge and expertise regarding mattresses and sleep studies. His customer service was out of this world. He was very welcoming and friendly. It was an awesome experience shopping at this store for a mattress, I would highly recommend it. His colleague Lee was also very helpful and welcoming as well. They make a great team!< /text>

Eldridge took me on a tour of mattresses to find my perfect fit. I was super impressed with his knowledge and his genuine helpfulness to find the perfect mattresses for me. The topper was the great deal I got. Eldridge, I thank you.< /Text>

Leland Gill was our representative and did not disappoint. Everything was smooth beginning to finish. Met all our needs and was able to answer all our questions. He was very friendly with our kids and we had a great time picking out a bed. I’m extremely happy with the service. I would highly recommended mattress firm. If you end up taking a visit, ask for Leland Gill. :)</text>

Excellent sales rep didn’t try to sell me on anything I didn’t need, had great discounts I didn’t even know when I walked in. I got an adjustable bed frame so reasonably priced I added a new memory foam mattress for my daughter to my order. Great customer service!</Review>

I just bought 2 mattresses: 1 king with adjustable base and 1 full with box spring. Eldridge was great and really helpful throughout the whole process of trying the mattresses and purchasing them. He showed me all different sizes.. from Twin to King. I really appreciate that. Thank you. I definitely recommend the Olson, RC branch and Eldridge. Very very nice guy!<//text>

Went mattress shopping with my wife last weekend to find what kind of mattress would be the best balance between the two of us. Eldridge was extraordinary. He went above and beyond, made us feel at home while providing us detailed information on each of the different mattresses. Although we didn't purchase anything that day, we left well informed of the different options available. This place has been the absolute best mattress shopping experience I've had by far. Would give 20/5 of I could.

PS: The purple mattress that you see all over the internet is available to try out at this place as well. Definitely something I'd recommend to experience!< /review>

Eldridge went above and beyond to help us get a great deal and walk out with a mattress same day!
Just wanted to update...
We had such a great experience shopping for my son’s mattress that we came back to buy one for my husband and myself. James was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. He went out of his way to make sure we got a great deal on everything we needed to finally get a good night’s sleep. I won’t go anywhere else! This store and staff are the best!<//review>

We highly recommend Matress Firm in Rancho Cordova, for your next matress purchase. This was one of the best customer service experience's we've received. Eldridge Cisco was extremely helpful and patient as we were able to experience the comfort of all mattress types to see which one fit best for us. We ended up choosing the Pressuresmart full matress and pad.  Thank you Mattress Firm!< /review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>I purchased my mattress sometime in 2014, and I had a great experience then. Today, when I called the Rancho Cordova store, J.D. continued this for me. I called asking about how to file a warranty claim. Being new and just out of training, J.D. didn’t know the answer off the top of his head, but he took my number and promised to find out and call me back. Within five minutes he had provided me with all the information I needed. J.D was friendly, professional, and timely in assisting me. Another solid customer experience at Mattress Firm!</review>< Pics>

<UserId.>104718965023252056007< /UserId.><Review>J.d. is a stellar salesman! Very informative! We needed a bigger bed to accommodate me, my fiance and our 70lbs pitbull 😁 Some of the points that he made we didn't even realize mattered when picking out a mattress so we were definitely impressed!
Even with a budget he was able to find us something that really fit our needs and made us feel really good about our purchase! I have been telling everyone I know to head on over to Mattress Firm if you are having aches and pains or having trouble sleeping or sleeping hot or cold! There is a solution! Thank you Matress Firm and thank you J.d. for your excellent customer service!!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Just purchased a new mattress from JD Smith and he was able to get us a great deal on the mattress and by waiving the freebie adjustable base promotion (which is something we didn’t need) he was able to get us some other extras. The customer service was amazing and we never felt pressured to buy. He didn’t try to up sale our purchase as some salesmen will do and we really appreciated that. The manager (Eldridge) also provided great customer service and let us know to call him anytime should we have any questions or concerns regarding our purchase in the future. Overall, I just can’t recommend this Mattress Firm location enough! Great experience!</Text>< pics>

Eldridge made sure we walked out of there with something we would love, and we did! We just received our bed today, as promised and we are even more thrilled with the choice. Eldridge made sure we tried everything that fit our budget and that could help with our current body type. Having to choose a bed that both myself and my husband would like, I thought would be difficult. But it worked out smoothly. Madison was working the front desk, she was very nice and explained our check out list so that we didn't have to ask any questions! Definitely referring my friends, family and clients here!< /text>

<review>We have been shopping for a new mattress for a while now, and today we went to several different store in our area.

Our experience at Mattress Firm was the best of all the stores we walked into. Not only was the customer service outstanding but we found the perfect bed. I have to be honest we went to their competitor first and they wanted to sell us a floor model bed, but Mattress Firm bet them in every aspect of sales and service.

We will never go to another store for a new mattress again. THANK YOU Mattress Firm for helping us find the perfect bed for us!<//review>< UserId.>

I have sciatica nerve pain and have been sleeping horribly. I went in worried about the right headboard and J.D. introduced me to the awesomeness of the adjustable base. As soon as he raised my legs the pain subsided immediately. I am so thankful for J.D. having the time and patience to let me try out 20 beds!!! I am a medium and I never knew! Really is great to have someone so knowledgeable help you and get you in the right bed for you and at the right price!! Go to the rancho Cordova mattress firm and ask for J.D. and sleep better tonite!! Thank you so much!!< /Text>

<review>Came in today to see some options with the purple mattress. Madisen quickly came to assist us. She was nothing short of amazing and very sweet. She was able to give us great information about what we were looking to get and at the same time gave us the time and space to truly make up our minds about what was best for us. Would highly recommend this rancho cordova location. My parents also recently purchased from there and were equally as happy with her customer service.

Bought a mattress from John Prowen at the Olson Drive Mattress Firm in Rancho Cordova.  He was a pleasure to work with. I went to a  couple other stores first, before coming here. While I wanted to do my due diligence, after working with John I realized i pretty much wasted my time in the other stores I went to. Highly recommend going to see him. He mentioned he has been in the industry for 13 years, and it shows. Thanks for the amazing service John!<//text>

What a nightmare I go in to buy a mattress,  what I was told at end of loan I could get progressive to right a recommendation to the credit bureaus, well that was incorrect progressive has nothing to do with any credit reporting agencies this was told by progressive. Next payment was not what I was told so I called to cancel, the person helping me offered me better deal but when I called to tell him I would pick up the mattress, you would think they take the delivery fee of 99 of well they offered to take 50 off and still charge me 49.99 on my invoice even when there was no delivery being done. If you think logically all 99 should come off. Well I did cancel this time total bad experience.  Good look to anyone else.</review>

I was in the market for a new pillow. After a short explanation of what I wanted J.D. Smith suggested the perfect pillow. I highly suggest Mattress Firm for all your mattress and pillow needs.<//Text>

My partner and I needed a new mattress like the earth needs climate change action.

We were both dreading the car-salesmanesque pitch that we knew was coming as soon as we opened the doors. I am pleased to say we were promptly greeted but not promptly bullied. Madisen greeted us with a genuine style offered a "guided process" through selecting a mattress and never made us feel like a hostage.

Madisen was an attentive salesperson who listened to our needs and requests, she was deliberate and thoughtful in her word choice, and endlessly patient while we methodically sorted out each mattress. At one point during the process I recall thinking that Madisen was really good at her job.

We decided to purchase a mattress here and the checkout process was just as smooth as the selection process. Here we learned that we were Ms. Madisen's second ever customers! I would never have guessed.

If you want actual help in selecting a mattress that is right for you Madisen is your gal. I think she also gave us her diet soda from her lunch though she wouldn't admit it.

The showroom was clean and tidy though the smell is overwhelming. What you expect for a giant room full of mattresses. I'd have no problem at all recommending Mattress Firm on  Olsen to anyone looking for a mattress.<//Text>

<Review>This was the 2nd mattress that I have purchased from mattress firm solely because of the associate Eldridge Cisco. His courteousness, professionalism and product knowledge is top notch. If you ever need a mattress find HIS location. Give that man a raise!!!

<Text>Walked in to see about buying a bed for 4 year old. Eldridge Cisco showed us the beds that were available for the Full sizes and then pulled out each mattress so our son could try them out. Our son decided on a comfy bed that we liked as well. Mr. Cisco then showed us several beds for the parents and we finally decided on a Purple bed! Can’t wait until it get delivered tomorrow! Friendly service, interactive with our son and an overall excellent experience. We’ve told a few friends about our experience and told them to work with Mr. Cisco.</Text>< response>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>We brought our friends here to buy a mattress a year or two ago and they had great service.They bought a Purple 2 and when they wanted to exchange it for a Purple 3, the store helped them find another store that had it to try out before they exchanged their mattress because at that time, they only had the Purple and the Purple 2 in their store. Now they have the Purple 3 and Purple 4 available in their store. The exchange process was easy for our friends.

We just recently went a week ago to this store to buy a new mattress. The managers we spoke to when making our purchase were great. They had great attitudes and were very informative and helpful. They also don't crowd you or hang over you. The people here always give you space if you want it and are helpful when you have questions. We bought a Purple 4 mattress from them and John (one of the managers) made sure to let us know before we paid for our mattress that Purple has blown up so much that they have a lot of back orders and it could be up to a month before we got our mattress. He said if we still wanted the mattress we can get it or we could pick something else. I was fine with waiting a month for a new one so we bought it and John offered to keep us updated on the time frame. We declined getting the adjustable base because we would never use it. Instead we got 2 nice cooling pillows, a Purple seat cushion, and a 5 side mattress protector for free. The people at this location have always been kind and helpful. When I shop for a mattress, I start at this store and so far, I haven't been disappointed.

Update- We got our mattress on time! We ordered it Jan 20th and it was delivered on Jan 31st! yay!</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Bought a new mattress here several months ago. Seems pretty comfortable and well-made. The salesman was helpful and yet not intrusive. When we (ok, she) picked a mattress we (she again) really liked, the salesman put in a little leg work and found last year's model with a minor cosmetic blemish and saved me something like $600. When I tried to save money buy loading a king into my pickup, he offered free same day delivery to keep me from damaging the thing.< /Text>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><Text>My husband and I came into this store a couple weeks ago not expecting to buy a new mattress even though we needed to. We made a purchase that day, and the mattress was quickly delivered the next day.
I am very happy to report, that we both are experiencing the best nights of sleep we’ve had in years!! We were helped by a knowledgeable young lady name, Breann, who made the experience both easy and fun. Breann patiently explained the differences of all the mattresses, and answered all of our questions before we went ahead and selected our perfect match. I definitely recommend coming in to this location as soon as you’re ready to purchase your new mattress, I know you won’t regret it. After only a few nights of the best sleep of your life, you’ll will be wishing you came into this store sooner than you did. We thank you, Breann!</Text>< Pics>

<review>Came in with the wifey about a month ago to finally purchase a new bed after years of complaining about our old one. We were greeted by Bre, and she was fantastic! She patiently walked us through all of their different beds and helped us narrow down our favorites. After we finally decided on our favorite, she showed us their adjustable bases and explained how it would help my wife’s ongoing sciatic/hip pain and my acid reflux. She was right!

Thanks to Bre’s expertise, we are getting great sleep again!</review>< pictures>

Very little aggressiveness toward me (universally unpopular at time). The teachers went above and beyond many times in many different situations just with me personally. Most the girls were very amorous, lot of sleeping around, and restraining orders. It did make dating the others hard, they were always on edge. Never even saw "pot" around. The administration seemed unaware of reality though for some things like passing periods, I just made it rushing from one class to the other.</Text>< pics>

I went here and speaking from experience I am proud to be a dragon and be apart of A.S.B. Especially how much Del Dios has grown especially with boosting the environment and the teachers. Teachers here have great energy that makes you feel happy and have fun learning. Even if I had a bad day I would still go to school because I loved the it there. I want to give special thanks to Mr.Jaquess, Mrs.Garcia, Mrs. Jackson, Mr. Chen, Mr. DeNeve, Mrs.Horton, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Eldrige, Mr.Velasco, Mrs. Moon, Mrs. Candelore, Mrs. Fierro, Mrs. Campos, Mr. Carlon and Mr.Ngo. It's truly the only middle school I would ever want to go to again and relive it.< /review>

The school staff is super supportive and they are attentive with students. My son is in 7th, going to the 8th. He loves it here. Of course you get your wanna be tough ones but as long as you teach your kids to be proud of who they are and to ignore the bad comments, they'll do just fine. All schools have bullying unfortunately, it's up to the parent how they deal with it. Teach your kids to be tough and not take no s***. To stand up for themselves.  But all around I love this school. First and only middle school my son has been to.<//Review>

<Text>This school SEEMS good. Some of the teachers are great. But when my sister was bullied, impersonated, humiliated and much more. What did they do? Nothing. I get people get bullied at every school but what happened to my sister was much worse! If you have seen the movie cyberbully, it will give you an idea. Thank GOD my sister has me, I kept an eye on her and supported while our Mom was at work. But for this school, the students who bullied my sister said the school is a joke and it is!<//Text>< gmapID>

I went to this school last years and it was great! The teachers were nice and everything was good. Of course however there is a lot of bullying in the school but not everyone is like that. Just need to find the right friend to hang out with and BOOM, you have a great time for the rest of the year.( Mrs.Dunuway is doing this Sphero after school thing if anybody wants to join that. It’s pretty fun)<//Review>

Amazing school! Great teachers that prepared you for what lay ahead. If someone got kicked out then there was a real good reason. Say's a lot about someone on how they lash out to others.</Review>

<Review>A very bad middleschool. The special ed class here literally had a small storage room they called the "quiet room" where they would lock us in, and there were many bad and controversial things going on in that classroom. Most of the other special ed students in that classroom were extremely violent, and I was frequently getting bullied by several students whenever I walked around campus. The school was filled with bullies and mean teachers, and I was left traumatized by a lot of the terrible physical and verbal abuse that I endured at this very bad school.<//Review><username>Michael Leonard< /username><Time>1577952023056< /Time><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

< Review>
A awful school that the staff doesn't even care about the learning of the student's education. They do not even have good supervisor's that make sure that the students during their lunch or nutrition which is called recess, behaving well but no the noon supervisors don't even care if the students eat,bring or even bring drugs which an eighth grader was caught smoking in the restroom.Some of the P.E teachers are strict. If you are planning on going to Del Dios no pick another middle school like Bear Valley or Misson Middle but not that one because if experienced that school when I first went ti 6th grade but my parent's transfered me to Wilson Middle School in San Diego which the school's of San Diego are much better in many things than other school in the San Diego county.A very awful middle school<//Review>

< Review>
This school is terrible.  I know bullying is rampant and every school has to deal with it, but this school does nothing!!!  The teachers and principles won't even talk to the parents about it.  Even when it escalates to daily beatings, hospital trips and police involvement, there is no goal of resolution at all.  A very frustrating experience!<//Review>

The Teachers are bad over there one of them hesitated to help a student.Also the rules in the school are also bad like taking away the phones for the whole school year mostly all students are still using their phones because they hated that rule so much that they still use their phones.< /Text>

Some days are slower than others. I recommend walking across currently because the lines are awful. $6. To park is better than having to drive to San Luis to re-enter the country.</Review>

<text>Very good place to go have dental and optometry, good dentist nice clean good prices, town is just about 1000 feet from border, pharmacy combined with a liquor store (liquor starts selling at 11 am, ).
Be careful cuz birder closes at 3 pm and line can get pretty long mainly on weekends. Guards are very rude watch out.
Long,   long lines on weekends maybe you won't make it on time to cross. Only 2 lanes but reduses to only one after 10 cars.<//text>< gmap_id>

We have crossed the border at Andrade Port on foot and by vehicle, but almost always on foot. The port officers have always been very fair with our different situations, as much as can be expected. One time, we forgot to bring our passports, but they were practical, using our other picture I.D.s to support our American status. My wife is Filipino, but this didn't seem to change the fairness that we were given. The officers are firm and authoritative, as would be expected, but they are also kind and fair. I would never hesitate crossing, here and feel very safe. We have crossed close to 50 times over the past 15 years or so. We have dental work accomplished, as well as optometrist work. The city of Los Algodones is very safe and a great service to all who cross at Andrade Border crossing.<//Review>

My husband and I come to Algadones for excellent dental care and to purchase medications available at unbelievably low prices.  My inhaler is not covered by my health insurance.  In the US I could not afford it.  In Mexico, it's $40 per mo
In 15 years we have had no bad experiences-- just long return lines to get back to US during months of Mar-Apr.</review>

I give these folks at this port of entry five stars.  Normally I would not be so complimentary but these people deserve it.  I recently crossed here - May 21st, 2019, to be exact - and I was stressed out as I did not really want to return to the soulless, sterile life of utterly meaningless competition and consumerism that is America today.  I stalled by the turnstille trying to verbally talk myself into crossing back into the US and finally just did it, trying to explain to the officer I encountered at their pedestrian lane counter that it's often hard for me to return to  the US and that such has nothing to do with my take on US CBP.  Miraculously, I was treated respectfully and the US  CBP officer allowed that she understood.  I was just amazed, absolutely amazed.  Beyond that, it was nice that my bags were not searched as they often have been at this port of entry in the past, though I had nothing on me I should not have, it was nice to be treated so respectfully and for once not as a criminal defendant as I was processed to re-enter the United States.  Way to go, Andrade Port of Entry  and keep up both the good and the respectful work!</Text>

I went through this one once and it was not really nice. If they ask you "Do you have any gifts?" and you say "No" and you forget that you have some... then they would make you look like a kid they are in the need to teach.
I feel bad for those people. It is not protection, it is just a way for them to make themselves stand more right for no real reason.
In reality, they just make a bad impression of our country.<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>When Officer Haddock called my friend on secondary inspection, he threatened her with keeping her longer because she walked up to him with a smile. He said he did not like it when people smiled because it made him feel suspicious of them. After that awkward threat, the conversation continued. At one point he scolded my griend for not having her birth certificate, she said "damn" for her not being prepared and then Mr Haddock again threatened my friend to lock her up and stating that language was not allowed with him and that she should not swear again and then continued by saying "we can flex our muscles[cbp officers] and show you what we can do. We will lock you up and keep you here for a long time. You don't want that."

With all honesty i feel sorry for this man. A healthy human does not go threatening other peaceful humans for no reason. Mr Haddock has issues he needs to resolve before he takes on a position where he has to interact and serve the public. His threats of taking unlawful actions under the color of law is a risk to others and a liability to his superiors and the organization he represents.

Men like that do not have the moral capacity to be in positions like that.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I agree with the previous comment. Rude, rude, rude. I've been through customs in other places and have never experienced such poor customer service. We pay their salaries and they can't treat us with even a bit of respect. Their behavior reflects poorly on all government employees.</Text>

< Review>
So while crossing the border, once at the cubible, the officer tells me that next time i cross that i need not wait for which lane im going to choose. I looked at him and smiled. He then in an agressive approach and voice asked me "Why did you hestitate?"... In which i replied, "I hesitated because everytime i cross i always get stuck with the cocky arrogant officers and i for once wanted to make the correct choice, but i was wrong again"! Once he went back into the cubicle to input my info, i decided to eat a chips. He comes out and TELLS me to stop eating. I looked at him and laughed and told him he is out of his mind and eating is no crime. He tells me it has to do with respect. I did tell him "Well it obvious we dont respect each other as you have disrespected me way before i ate a fry. I ate another fry. The officers Supervisor stood next to the passenger window and i offered him a fry. I used to keep quiet, but some are very rude, they try to intimidate and use tactics to scare. Sarcasm will kill Sarcasm. They are not above the law and you have every right to question them to and/or give limited information about yourself since everything is on the computer.</Review>

(Translated by Google) From the United States, often of Mexico explore.

Time of return,
Entry stamp has not been pushed in the DFW to passport,
To another room (T_T)

Somehow re-entry to the United States 😅

(Original)
アメリカから、しばしのメキシコ探訪。

帰りの時、
パスポートにDFWでの入国スタンプが押されておらず、
別室へ(T_T)

なんとかアメリカへ再入国😅</Text>

(Translated by Google) Well-kept place and very popular with locals. On Friday and Saturday of the summer months you can listen to good live music.

(Original)
Luogo ben curato e molto frequentato dagli abitanti del posto. Nei giorni di Venerdì e Sabato dei mesi estivi si può ascoltare della buona musica dal vivo.<//review>

<review>I love this place! Deb in the tasting room is awesome and so outgoing. I've been a wine club member for years (this is the club membership that has outlasted all others). I love that most of their wines have a very distinct "Fenton Herriott" flavor that stands out. They do fun activities and social offerings where the owner cooks the food and everything. Wine club has flexibility. Definitely recommend checking it out. I love to bring friends out.<//review><Response>None</Response><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhOE_-N4pxgRCYaKPRU8CgfCM7i17GSb2YNyTI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Visited on 11/9. We did the BYO (bottle your own wine) experience. Would not return due to our interaction with the manager Debbi, who refused to seat us for a tasting, despite the fact we called in several days before. There are better options in the area. Bottling experience was fun. I’d stay away, though you may have a better experience if you’re white (the other groups present at the same time got noticeably better treatment).

As soon as we walked in, the staff member who greeted us (who turned out to be the manager) was extremely hostile and rude to our group. After refusing us tastings despite calling in the week before, we purchased 9 BYO bottles and were told to head to the cellar, no other explanation.

Getting to the cellar, the bottler was really nice and was really surprised we didn’t have a chance to do a tasting. He explained that each bottle we purchased actually included 2 tastings each and suggested us to give the tasting a try.

We returned to the tasting room where the other person working 6/9 sat of us. No explanations given for any wine we tasted. During tasting, the ‘manager’ was demanding ‘what do you guys want!?’. After asking for explanations, she kept saying in a very rude way, ‘you drink it.’ They didn’t pour the whole flight of 7 wines for us.< /review>

We always hit Fenton Herriott winery during the El Dorado Passport weekend.  Great wine, delicious pairings, barrel tastings and wonderfully kind staff. This year was no different, I bought a bottle of their Chocolate and Cherry dessert wine (YUM!!).<//review>

<Review>The staff were very awkward, rude, and unprofessional towards my friends and I even though we were there for a birthday and had called ahead in advance to let them know. We were hurriedly ushered to the BYO (Bottle Your Own) wine experience by Deb. The BYO was a fun experience on its own, and the staff member  (who was kind and much more patient) in charge of BYO was surprised we hadn't had a chance to taste the wine yet.

Once we went back to the tasting room, we decided to give it a go since 2 wine tasting fees were waived with the purchase of a bottle. Another staff member led the tastings but was very blunt and didn't explain any of the wines to us. Instead, she aggressively asked which wine we were at each time we were done so as to hurry up our tasting. This was strange because she seemed very hassled when pouring wine for us but took her sweet time joking around and talking to the other customers who were white unlike us.

In summary, the wine wasn't very good and if you're not white, I would be wary about going here for a wine tasting.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1574012413469, 'text': 'I am sorry for your experience.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>As I was the designated responsible non drinking adult of our party and I don't drink my review is based on my groups opinion of the wines.  They have a nice and inviting tasting room and it can get quite loud when more than ten people go in.  Their complaints were that the wine's alcohol content was not balanced with the flavor of the wine they expected.  The wines were around 12 to 14 percent but the group concluded that it tasted far higher, almost as strong as liquor.  If that is your preference maybe this would be the place for you, but it wasn't the case for our party.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Deb met us at the door, inviting us in with a big welcoming smile. We tried ALL of their wine and had trouble picking which one we liked the best. Well, we ended up buying a mixed case with almost one of every kind, having them ship it to Texas. Meeting the wine maker was a treat, too. This vineyard is small, but packs a big punch. Stop by, it'll be a real treat!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Fenton Herriott is our favourite winery in Apple Hill and we've been wine club members for many years. Debbie is one of the main reasons that we have participated in events and made a point to stop into the tasting room when we are in the area.

The wines are always high quality, refreshing, current, and suitable for personal drinking as well as gifting. We've introduced many friends to FH through gifting wine.

Events at the winery are also a great time, especially during COVID-19 times. They are creating a safe outdoor atmosphere for guests to enjoy food and beverages in a socially distanced way, right there in the vineyard.

Guy (the owner) is so friendly and always makes a point to talk to us when we are there for events, and as mentioned, Debbie is a real treasure and she knows all her wine club members and regular visitors on sight.

A real joy to visit every single time!<//review><Date>1596322856567<//Date></record>

Ordered and when I got home we realized part of our food was missing... We only live like 5 min away so I went back for my daughter food... Waited in line again and then we got out chalupa and taco that were missing. Once home we realized we were given the wrong food. I understand that they are busy and have respwct for people who work fast food, but mostly likely will not go back again.< /review>

I don't write reviews but being that their number doesn't work...

(this time) THEY DIDN'T EVEN HEAT the tortillas the made my "soft" taco with. This is the worst business I've ever been to. I don't know why I keep trying to give this place a chance. DO BETTER. These tacos were so COLD. I drove straight home and it's hot out. HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN???</review>< Pics>

<Text>Everything about this kfc/taco bell is horrible from location, food. Service, wait time, and even how the parking lot and building are designed.  If you order delivery from here expect extra long wait times and you really should tip your driver extra because they will miss out on other deliveries just waiting in line here.  Drivers do no except deliveries or offers from this place</Text>< Rate>

<review>My expectations aren't very high for fast food to start with, so they have to really work at it to get a bad rating.

The tortilla and beans were so dry and crumbly, I'm pretty sure the burrito they served me had dropped behind a counter last week and they just found it and dropped it in my bag. The flavor was also off, hope it wasn't because it's bad. The restaurant isn't on a main or busy road and is kind of hidden away, so the food probably sits a long time.

This is getting two stars instead of one because the cashier was nice.< /review>< date>

Do not go here if you ever expect them to get your order right. We live 1/2 mile from this establishment and go here for the convenience, but never again. Every time we go here, they don't do something correctly.</text>

Typically good service but this time it was bad enough for a review. Ordered food, they recited the order correctly as they passed it out the window but clearly they are not checking, just reciting, as 1/2 the order was missing. Should have checked the bag. Quite upset about it.< /Text>

Don’t EVER go through the drive thru unless you have 30+ minutes to blow (not exaggerating). Even if there’s only 3 cars in line and you think it’ll be quick, it won’t. The employees just sit around and talk to each other instead of hustling to get to the 10+ cars in the drive thru. Also don’t order anything from the KFC side unless you want half your order to be missing.< /text><user_name>Nikki Geiger< /user_name><gmapID>0x80dc9e3ba4828ea3:0xe5321d90273d3e6< /gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

<Review>The food is good. The service is poor. The only reason I don't like going there is because of how long it takes to get my food through the drive thru. It's ridiculous sometimes. I wouldn't recommend going through the drive thru.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I think they hate their job.   20 minutes at the drive through.  McDonalds and JITB have parking spots to pull in and they  bring you out the food.   There always seems to be some issue I have hear. I come here because it is the closest.  I decided after a 20 minute wait at the drive through that I am done with this location, quicker to drive further some place else.</review>

If i can rate this place a zero i would...firstly i would like to say their intrest rates are super high and each payment we give BI WEEKLY  is 231 yet our balance just goes down by $100  they have so many hidden fees and stuff they do not mention but they do rush you to sign the contract please if your in need of money go to a different place this place is not worth it

Edit: also they asked us to rate them 5 start as soon as they started helping us without us having any experience with them</Text>

Well, the employees are great of greeting you as you come in. That gives some comfort that they know you're  there. Helps you out in when you're in a little jam and gives a little advice if needed. Most of all they make you feel welcomed, comfortable and I thank you for that. Keep up the great work</review>

<review>We appreciate that they were able to help us when in need but the staff needs training and a general update on policy's. Wrong info was given and other people blamed and not one apology. We had to miss work and wait around for someone who knows what they are doing only to be left with no help. We lost money at work and had to pay extra fees because of the days we had to wait to pay off a loan because of staff not knowing or having what they need to do thier jobs. Extremely disappointed with the staff here</review>< Pictures>

Received a letter Stating my approval for a loan, and when I called to confirm that if I go in for the loan I won’t be denied they said yes come in. I was hesitant so I asked a few questions like what is the income qualifications? Ect. They kept saying they can’t tell me that until I fill out an application. I told them I did not want to go in a waste both our times and ding my credit if my income wouldn’t be enough. They said the letter is an approval. Long story short. My time was wasted.< /Review>

Got a letter saying I was pre approved for a loan, went in to get the loan and then got told it was declined. So now I have a hard enquirer on my credit report when the whole point of the letter said it was going to be approved. Pissed me off I will never trust the company again.< /review>

<Review>Lunch was OK today, service was not the best- keeping in mind they were not very busy(maybe 5 table full), but after we got the food, we were satisfied. The chicken is always great, brisket was a little dry, ribs ok- get the combo platter to share and get a bit of everything. I like having the selection of sauces at the table to try- keeps almost everyone happy! Beans and coleslaw are good too! All in all, it's good, but there is always room for improvement. I will give them a try again someday-</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAkLWDTG9bk3o2TIwxsyBAuNZrK9QSCFm1ga_x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPe3Ua9iG8gXvCO6kNtfckoLt9Zj7-Pnr7IJdPa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1SZTVl2iyWn2xDA_WAby4VgGvtDiO-uYPSB08=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmpuyaoxCgv2cg8u2cwbD1jTz70Tfr1r2m2wj7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6Xdzfv4wugLOMWNxuckV7fecIYR1xQRNSZVRh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKwV-1nYo7BLIigEjT4UTANGtbYIi9JqPvS74P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNub-WwNF1U0MhlsX9Hj8BO0DAAK3IYVNfQRRjc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5Cpw9rkAwFNwCw3hF9iT4A-HSp_IHpYPD1QF3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNVcO3ND2pJA5UfZUx_d6T1oCXlfDbGU8ADG2r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x54d2932a4ac5b14d:0x23e6ec3135c7f135<//Gmap_id></record>

We called the restaurant beforehand to see how long the wait was to get a table, and they said it was about 20-25 minutes. When we asked if we could make a reservation, they rudely told us that they don’t and hung up. We finally get there and are told that they had around the same wait time so we sat down. We only ended up waiting about 10 minutes to get a table which was nice, but when we get to our seats it took about 20 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our order, and over half an hour just to get a small bowl of raw potato chips. Then another 10 minutes went by before we got our actual food. The main dishes themselves were fine, and there were no conplaints there. But throughout our meals there was little to no service from our waiter and when they did come by it seemed like they were just waiting for us to finish and leave as soon as possible. I would not recommend dining at this restaurant, because the service is just awful. I would give them zero stars if that was an option.< /Text>

Was 110° outside and was told the air conditioner was broken in the kitchen. In the end, the food was amazing and the waitress redeemed the rest of the store. Kitchen staff came out and made a personal apology for the unusually long wait. I'd be happy to go back next time we're in town.

I wish I could not give any stars, worst customer service ever and the manager by the name of Kelsey does not know how to keep good business.  My husband and I reviewed the website and called to place an order. When they gave us the total it sounded overpriced we told the "manager" we think the total amount is wrong and we must be getting over charged. She went over the order with us and said the Dave Sassy Chicken salad was $12.49. I explained that the website says $10.49 which I took a screenshot of. She said she just told me the price and asked if I wanted the order or not. I asked her if she was willing to lose a customer over a $2 dollar discrepancy and asked if they would just honor the price from the site since this is clearly not my error. She said its an IT issue and asked again if I wanted the order. I can tell by her asking multiple times if I wanted to keep the order or not that she wanted to get me off the phone and didn't care to keep my business. As a manager she should have handled the situation better and not try to push me to cancel my order. Which I did. This is clearly unacceptable and poor customer service. I will not be returning to this establishment.</review>

The food was amazing! If been to one in Las Vegas and it was good too, but this location here in Redding blew my taste buds away.

I would have preferred being told as we sat down that kids ate free that night rather than at the end.<//text>

< Review>
My girlfriend and I went here on the opening night. I've been to other Famous Dave's locations in Washington state, but this was the first time she had dined there.

We each ordered the 2 meat and 2 sides entree, and shared everything.  The highlights were the rib tips, cod, mac and cheese, beans, and garlic mashed potatoes.

We both enjoyed the meal and had leftovers to take home.  It took a while to be seated, but that's to be expected at a place that just opened.< /Review>

The sweet corn had no taste, famous fries tasted liked they'd been boiled and put in the oven, grilled pineapple couldn't eat.  The ribs and chicken weren't anything spectacular.

Not only did my phone host sound like a grump, he would continuously sigh after every order. Stating “is that it?” Don’t usually complain, considering I’ve worked fast food for 4 years, as well as being a manager a year and a half during. So I TOTALLY get it. But regardless of your day, a guest should always feel wanted. The tone of voice alone can change the whole experience, whether it be a worker or guest.

The worst Beef brisket I've ever eaten. It was cut very thick
and had no smoke flavor. It looked like a blank slice of pork tender loin.
Not even close to Texas style. Too bad I use to like eating here'
The side orders were good. The waitress in the bar wasn't very helpful.< /Review>

Another fun thing here is the different names they have for their BBQ sauce.  I like "devil's spit", doesn't sound appetizing, but that sauce had a good spicy kick to it.  I got the ribs which was very good and my daughters got the brisket sandwich, also good.  You can pick the sides that comes with your dishes.  We got a small plate of house BBQ chips, our waiter said not to get that with our sides since we'll get a plate, but I think I would even after getting the sample plate.  I got a side of corn, wasn't expect a whole fresh corn on the cob.</text>< pics>

Ordered take out here a couple months ago because I was craving some BBQ and I heard this place was good, I got FOOD POISONING and was vomiting for the next day or so. I'm never going back. I drive past this place everyday on my way home from work and just looking at the building makes me noxious 🤢🤢<//review>

< Review>
By far the worst BBQ I've ever eaten the ribs were dry and tasted like they had been reheated a few times and the brisket looked like it was a week old I'm not sure how anyone can call this BBQ go to a place called buckhorn grill in vacaville and you will never go back here. The waitress asked if I wanted a box I said no I didn't like it the meat was dry and not very good she looked shocked and said dry? There is bbq sauce on it. For good bbq or meat you don't need sauce you need the meat to be flavorful and juicy withought putting sauce..</Review>

<Name>Terry MacDonald</Name><Text>Now out of business.  Food that fits our pallets very well. Never had any bad food in here. And I've had some really good service. There's a guy that works at the one in Redding he was in the Marines, fabulous man. I think he is Angelo. And simperfy to him.

Just found out they are closing soon. I am profoundly disappointed. I've taken many visitors there and always like the servers and food . The bar theder lady ii always ready to trade quips. Will sadly miss this great place.

Now they are permanently closed. I happened to see a fellow that worked there for 7 years. He is very disappointed in the way they did it to employees.

This writer will not patronize another famous dave's.< /Text></record>

<Review>Tried to order takeout via website and by calling in. Website just gave an error every time I tried to process order. When I called in, staff just kept rerouting me to voicemail. You'd think a chain of this size could handle a takeout order.

Update: A few weeks later, I went in person to order takeout... I should have just left well enough alone. The bbq is awful.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

You pay a bit more for a nice interior, and while the food is good, it's nothing special. I was disappointed to see they didn't offer pulled pork, only chopped pork. The selection of BBQ sauces is one of their highlights, along with friendly staff.< /Review>

Staff wasn't around to talk to and had to hunt someone down to even pay for our order. Staff wasn't friendly at all nor helpful. They barely aknowledge you and walk away mid conversation...

Usually would chalk this up to a busy Sunday but this is the third experience we have had here like this. We won't be back. Save your self the hassle and frustration and check out fat daddy's or smokin Joe's instead. Much friendlier and better food.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Very disappointing for all four of us. Ribs dried out and tough, what more needs to be said about a bbq place?  I've eaten at a FD's out of state and it was better, but still the dried tough ribs. Brisket is a waste.  If you tell them (nicely of course) they seem to really take it to heart, but it's just the way they do it normally.<//Text>

Food was absolutely horrible I've been to several famous daves across the country and this one should be ashamed to have the name. I had brisket which was drier then jerkey and I had that ribs which were disgustingly fatty and were riddled with the chefs hair. All food was freezer burnt and tasteless. I will not be returning!</review>

Lee’s Air and Plumbing is great! They’re very responsive and timely. Francisco is thorough and thoughtful in his work and always kept me updated through the whole process. If I can give him 10 stars I would. I will definitely continue to use them for annual maintenance and any required services in the future.<//text>

Francisco was absolutely amazing. He was very professional from the moment he arrived till the moment he left our house. He explained what he was doing the entire time and made me feel at ease the entire time. He corrected some issues in our attic where the drain piping was hooked up incorrectly from the original building of the house. Francisco is an asset to your team and deserves a high five and a pat on the back. Thank you for making this experience amazing.<//review>

<Review>I love this company! They always keep in contact with you, arrive on time or earlier with a phone call, are friendly, courteous, wear foot coverings, let you know if any further problems arise, and things stay fixed the first time. I love the maintenance plan. They give me peace of mind with my heating, A/C, and plumbing and that is golden. I have used them for years.< /Review>< username>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I was having problem with my water getting hot, I called them and they were out the same day. Not only was Ruben super professional he also gave me the best deal possible and explained in detail what he was doing. I am so happy, I will continue to always be a customer they have helped me every time that I have called them. And it was actually cheaper than if I were going to call a private person. I’ve tried that before and it has not worked in the past. Thank you again I am always going to use Lee’s plumbing and air they are very very reasonable, and they always try to give you the best deal. Thank you Rueben you were awesome< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I called a few places to get pricing for regular maintenance since my unit is a bit older. I received a quick response from Lee's. Price seemed fair. On the day of service, Nikolas explain every step as he was inspecting and repairing my unit. Staff was very respectful and over all great customer service.<//text>

Derek came for my AC maintenance.  I think he was ok.  I asked about the ducts and he said by looking at the previous pictures, it might not be the most efficient and can be replaced to make it more efficient.  The previous maintenance guy (Alfredo) in the same company always checked the ducts as well and he was very thorough.  He literally checked everything.   But Derek didn’t check the duct system himself this time.  Not sure if that’s normal or not.</review>

<Review>Peter Q. Was knowledgeable, professional and friendly.
He replaced my outdoor hose faucets quickly.
I can't ask for anything better!
I didn't check good value because I didn't shop around and compare but honestly I didn't need to!
Thank you for the great service.< /Review>< pictures>

In a time where some businesses sweet talk to you to get your business then ignore you once they have it, I had the best experience with Lee's Air. They kept me posted of the progress of their work. They cleaned up after themselves, daily!...it was a 3 day job. And being technology challenged, they made sure I knew how to work my new thermostat. So, as a whole, they have my loyalty.< /Review>

I had a hairline crack in a 90 degree couple in
my supply water line.  Michael and another repair technician identified the problem and dug down to find the leak and replaced the damaged part with better, more durable materials.   I am very pleased with the quality of work and the friendly professionalism.< /Review>

< Review>
Ruben was great and he had he did a plumbing repair where a spicket was for a hose. My horse probably played with it with his hoof and cracked the PVC but I was glad they came out so quickly. I have a regular plumber that's a friend but he couldn't come out soon enough. Ruben was very professional, very nice and courteous. I would not hesitate to use them in the future.< /Review>

<Text>Horrible service. Generally I love chili’s. But today, the day of my dads birthday they were so unfair! We all work pretty late and so we tried to get there as soon as possible. They close at 9, we got there at 8:45, and the lady there said that they were no longer serving customers because it’s 9 and they’re closed! Horrible! I hope they know that y’all ruined a hard working mans day!<//Text>< pics>

Food was good but the service needs to be be good too. I know the tips are computer generated now so forgetting our drinks didn't seem like a big deal. With just a tap of the screen when checking out they know a great tip was just tapped for them. We still want a nice happy person serving our table so regroup the staff and get them to get all there tables they served for the day to return because of great service that they will pass on to there friends and family.</Text>

Chilis states they are open at 11AM. Do you know how difficult it is to get 4 kids in and out the car? Anyway something posted on the door, on a peice of a paper, stating they where closed until 3pm due to Poorly Managed resteraunt. Me and about 4 other cars left disappointed to eat somewhere else.< /Text>< Rate>

Excellent 2 for $25 meal deal! Shared an an onion bloom appetizer, hsbd had fajitas I had shrimp pasta, added a $5 Presidente Margarita, and included a cheesecake dessert. Husband added a loaded baked potato soup and tall draft iPA. We can’t get over all the food, quality, taste and excellent service ALL for only $46! Our service was top notch, food was hot, tasty, and plentiful! We sat at the bar, indoor dining open, and felt very welcomed. Thank you Chili’s  for the great post Covid dining experience👏</review>

Everything was great! We came on a Monday night. He had two beers. I had the El niño margarita. He had the cajun pasta and I had the blue cheese chicken sandwich. It definitely need some buffalo sauce or something. I LOVE blue cheese and for me it was even a little over powering standing alone on the sandwhich. Our server was awesome she was super polite and pretty quick until her section got full she didn't bother saying goodnight.. which was surprising bc our table was right by the kitchen door. So that was a bummer we wanted to tell her thanks! We'll be back.</review>

The last 2 times we’ve been in the service has been horrible!!    There were 3 families and 2 servers.  We waited and waited and  were completely ignored until we just walked out!!!   Saying “hello, i’ll be right with you”. isn’t rocket science.</review>

They were not Crispy,  but very soft and SOGGY.   Actually, even the Pickles were so tough I couldn't bite into them.   As soon as I got home, I just threw them in the garbage.

Our waitress gave us a great service, the food was amazing,  also the price, I highly recommend the place.
I ask for the salmon and I loved it,  it was juicy and tasty,  we order a full ribs and a spinach cheese,  all the dishes super gummy,  finally the strawberry margarita.<//Review>

The service was fantastic and the servers were always asking if everything was good or if there was anything else they could do for us. I highly recommend the mango and strawberry margaritas!🍸 The food is inexpensive and the portions were good sized.

Oh boy. This is a great restaurant. They have all sorts of foods so don't even worry about finding something you like. Their stuff is all quality and usually will fill you up pretty well, so maybe come with an empty stomach. It's a little higher-end so come here on a birthday, for family night, for graduation or when you want. It's always delicious either way.< /Text>

<review>Here on Veteran's Day around 7pm. It was busy! Quoted 20 min wait, waited 10 before we were seated. We were a party of 4 seated next to the kitchen. Aside from the brisk wind coming from the kitchen, ALL of our service was amazing. Our server and all the crew were fast, courteous, and on point with plate removal and refills. We couldn't have been happier. Our server made us feel like family today!<//review>< Pictures>

<review>5 star for the young server that made us so comfortable and happy at dining in there today, unfortunately I can't recall his name! he was on our table Friday June 5th at 7:30 pm. The food was good, the ribs and chicken were cooked to perfection, the side of brockly and asparagus was very salty other than that was good.<//review>< gmap_id>

THE BEST CHILIS!!!! Great staff,  best waiters around. Great happy hour prices. This is my 5 year old daughter's favorite restaurant and they treat us like Norm from cheers. They have a ton of great prices options, wonderful staff,  fast takeout- lots of parking. Never a wait in the bar and they serve the full menu there</Text>

Usually we have a great visit however tonight the staff must have been short.  Took 20 minutes to get the sauces I ordered with my meal and even longer to get refills.  Our waiting was nothing but friendly, however the food runners were preoccupied as they dropped off our appetizers and main courses.  Aside from seeing the food runners maybe 3 or 4 times in the dining room the whole night, the only other staff we saw was the hostess and our waiter. Both were running around like crazy the who night.  We will be putting off our next visit for quite some time to allow staffing situations to improve.</text>

Service today was good although they were pretty empty. You kind of know what you are getting when you go here. The pricing is right but at this point I would like them to update their menu. It is getting stale. Overall I am happy with my experience.</review>

Oh boy. This is a great restaurant. They have all sorts of foods so don't even worry about finding something you like. Their stuff is all quality and usually will fill you up pretty well, so maybe come with an empty stomach. It's a little higher-end so come here on a birthday, for family night, for graduation or when you want. It's always delicious either way.< /Review>

One of my preferred spots for quality texmex. Everyone at our table was glad to be there. Definitely worth a return trip. Bring your hunger - portions are generous. Feeling here is similar to a cafe in San Jose I liked.<//Text>

<Time>1532551251775<//Time><rate>3</rate><review>I have been in a few times. Every time, the waiter or waitress are super helpful when they're with you. I think they are in charge of too many tables because you don't see them really more than two to four times in the entire visit. Once to take a drink order, the next for food order, next to check how food is and then to make sure you know how to pay on the tablet device.  It can take a few minutes to flag them down if you need something. Usually I have to flag them down for a  refill on my beverage.  I had special promotional gift cards to use along with a regular gift card. They are supposed to be able to be scanned on the tablet device, but each time it hasn't worked. I then had to wait to flag them down, in which they have to flag their manager down to take care of it. Each time, the manager has had issues getting the promotional gift cards to work.  Thankfully the manager will get it all to work, but it all takes time. I might spend about forty-five minutes from ordering to finishing eating, but then I spend an additional forty-five minutes to try and get the payment figured out.  The food is amazing and very good. Great atmosphere, but plan the trip with time in mind.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x8090504ec98781ad:0x776a16d2dc8e386c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Was good good! I had never eaten at a Chili's Restaurant before today, and I was not disappointed! I had the Chicken enchiladas with black beans, with a delicious white sauce! The chips and salsa was perfect for my taste!
Friendly staff, great menu variety of food with good prices! Clean, and trendy and easy to pay bill at the table with some computer thing..
Also got a kick out of the hostess, she seen us coming up the sidewalk outside and held the door open for us, nice touch! And very welcoming! We will definitely be going back!< /Review>

The server was nice. They checked in consistently although I would suggest checking in a bit less. I might have felt like they were trying to get me out of there quickly if I hadn't heard them checking in with the other table so often as well. Very nice, clean and the good was great as always. Thanks for the free chips and salsa! Just joined the rewards club today 😃</review>

Good food and a short wait. This particular Chili's seems to be a good one. I had no complaints. The serving staff is nice and the food came out in a timely manner. I enjoy the atmosphere here due to it being pretty family friendly along with an engaging staff! Honestly one of the best Chili's I've been to!</text>

The Chips and hamburger Buns Are Too greasy. Our server was fabulous! No wait time which was good. They need to stop changing their menu snd go back to the original one snd stay there.<//Review>

Food and staff was nice. There was a bad odor like stagnant water coming from the back by the restrooms (inside of which didn't smell bad), that was smellable from our table. I notified the manager and he didn't smell it but said he would look into it.</review>

<review>Zero priority is given to us 3rd party drivers. Also a bit stuck up with this nonsense of waiting in the car for them to bring us the order. No I don't want you anywhere near my car. Here I am already 5 minutes past the suggested pick up time. Its called Doordash for a reason.<//review>< rate>

Decent food, staff gave the impression of attentiveness however orders were forgotten/late and no one even gave a little bit of interest to the babies on the group or from keeping stuff out of their reach.<//review>

Went in for the "express lunch" with my wife. The lunch was anything but express. We both got the soup & salad lunch. The salad came out right away, but soup was nowhere, we asked 3 times for our soup. When our soup finally came out 25 minutes after our salad came out, it was cold! We were there for 45mins for a "quick" lunch. We wont be coming back anytime soon.< /Text>

Service was Terrible!   The food was mediocre at best.  Our waiter wasn't attentive at all.  Asked for condiments from 2 different servers and never did get them. Our waiter dropped off the bill and disappeared.  It was incorrect.  After waiting about 10 minutes for the waiter to reappear, I went to the hostess at the front counter to question our bill.  I was told I'd have to talk to our waiter to get the bill corrected.  Finally got it all worked out, but it wasn't a great experience.</Text>

I think Chilis used to be a real good place but I think  over time they lost themselves... their best dish in my opinion have to be the fajitas with chicken and steak w/ all the trimmings... but I just always seem to go with the triple dipper which is 3 basically smaller versions of the appetizers... Honestly, the only reason I come here is the chips and salsa and my kid likes the kids pizza meal... Service was good but it wasnt busy and we were there about 9:45pm!</text>

Food was great but I asked to redeem my free chips and they told me I couldn't cause I was already getting one of the meal deals. But it says nothing about either or. So I thought that was wrong all together and something about you have to go about 30 times in order to redeem offers. Which I thought that was odd but all in all it was good.<//Text>

< review>
Not the best Chili's I've been to. Staff is generally very pleasant, but I find that they're only attentive to your table up until your main course arrives. At that point they are no where to be found except for their initial "How is everything?" at the two minute mark, most likely with food in your mouth, and barely giving you time to swallow and respond before wondering off to another table. The last meal I got there, took much longer than tables that were seated way after myself, the food came out lukewarm to cold, and then we were stuck there for days waiting to pay our tab and leave. Honestly only good to go during Happy Hours for cheap apps and/or endless chips.</review>

Friendly, happy place! Everyone we interacted with was super friendly and helpful. We ordered the 2 meals for $25. Food came quickly and was hot and fresh. My water glass was refilled just after it was half gone several times. The bathroom was clean with no ordor but one stall is very small.
We enjoyed our visit and will come again.< /review>

<Review>I think Chilis used to be a real good place but I think  over time they lost themselves... their best dish in my opinion have to be the fajitas with chicken and steak w/ all the trimmings... but I just always seem to go with the triple dipper which is 3 basically smaller versions of the appetizers... Honestly, the only reason I come here is the chips and salsa and my kid likes the kids pizza meal... Service was good but it wasnt busy and we were there about 9:45pm!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Its good as always. I would just like to see a bit more variety in the menu. We go here every few months or so and nothing really new, just the same things in different platters or arrangements. I love alot of the drink choices they have in their bar menu.< /review>

Had to ask for refills as opposed to being asked. Was given the wrong drink once. Overall the waitress was very friendly but was a little overwhelmed. Still made up for it with a great desert.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Bad on my part I can't remember servers name. But she was very nice. Offered us options and of course free chips thru the app they have. Tended to the kids and us, even sang me happy birthday which I didn't think they did anymore.
Fajitas were delicious, very much improved.< /Review><user>100337790775423072153< /user>< date>

My First experience at this Restaurant was not what I expected. 1st.) Of all the Waitress that was attending to us was very friendly, 2nd.) Of all the food was good, But however, my personal order did not come complete, I  ordered the Sirloin Classic, which I received only the Steak and Broccoli. The mashed potatoes that went with the order was served to me as I was finishing up what was considered my plate ordered. I will not be returning to this Restaurant 😔
P.S  I can not post without rating, so I will give this 1 star rating for the very friendly waitress.< /text>

Great food and service! Went back today for lunch. Who puts an unripe slice of tomato on a burger and tries to hide it with shredded lettuce? Ruined it for me. Won't be back! Rude waitress couldn't ask if we needed tea or water refilled ... Had to ask ... Really?<//text>

Wow. Just wow. Sorry wish I Could give less then 1 star!  Waited an hr for our food. Almost all of it was ICE COLD! Platters were missing items like the garlic bread, corn on the cob etc.  Burger and bun tasted like it was microwaved as parts were soggy and some hard.  On a positive note, the 3 scrawny pickle slices were good and they didn't mess up our simple non alcoholic drinks of pop, milk and juice...... 😮 spoke to manager she apologized but basically got "we're backed up, all orders are slow getting out".  On Feb 11, 2017 @ 7 pm.  That would have been ok but then to have missing items and COLD food too??? Nope. Worst restaurant experience ever.  Hands down.</review>

Food comes out quick and tasty. Usually there isn't a wait for a table - convenient for an easy night out. So far all of the table kiosk tablets have worked just fine, but beware the greasy screens!</Review>

Dont eat there often, seems like the quality of food is going downhill.  The sandwich I got was soggy and the sliced turkey looked like it came out of a package.  Pretty tasteless.<//review>

<Text>We got the worst service here. We loved coming to this location but lately I don't know what's going on with the service here. It took an hour to get our food and when the food got there it was cold. But the time we finally got our check everything was wrong with it. It took the server 30 minutes to fix our check and after all this long wait and the confusion with it. We didn't even get an apology. I would recommend any other location then here.</Text>< Resp>

<text>Hosts are uncaring. Food takes 25 mins on a slow night. Management (balding man with spectacles and a fake smile) acts like he cares, quietly waiting for you to stop complaining so he can tell you how sorry he is and offer a free dessert. When it came time to pay, said manager snatches up the kiosk so we don't leave a bad review. I will have to come back in sometime and not complain so I leave a proper review. I also saw a cockroach by the front desk, when I pointed it out the hostess rolled her eyes and crushed it with her fingers, then turned to stare at me. The drinks were nice I guess, only thing not ruined.< /text></record>

Excellent service. Our server, Shauna, never let our drinks get half empty. Food came out super fast. Barley had time to finish our appetizers. Bugers were cook to perfection. Highly reccomend this Chili's.</Review>

< Review>
9 times out of 10 you will get a new server who is pretty excited to have a job there. That odd server out who is just completely over it. Don't be affraid to let the manager know so you can be accommodated accordingly. I know when I go out to eat it definitely is not to be treated like a burden. The food is great 95% of the time. If there is anything wrong or you oopsed! Your order. Just let your server know. They aim to please (like most restaurants these days) my personal recommendations is to sit in jourdons section(he looks like Paul walker and has a super happy disposition) order the chips and salsa (just enough bite for the adults and it's refillable for you get your dollars worth. The rest is history (*you absolutely must try the honey chipotle chicken crispers mmmmmm mmm!)<//Review>

<review>Walked around the mall for sometime and built up an appetite. Decided on chillis, been to others and never had a bad experience (Tracy, Manteca). This however, was a different story. The hostess was very zombie-like, depressing, and extremely unhelpful. We sat ourselves after being offered by a number of points to every seating area. She made it feel as if I needed an antidepressant with my drinks. Had to get up and get a high-chair for the baby because one was not offered. We then waited for 15 minutes until we were seen. The drinks (all water and a beer) took another 10 minutes. Orders were taken and we then got a new server. Very upbeat and on top of her tables. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't have paid for the meal at all. Never going here again. Depressing atmosphere, and horrid hostess. :)< /review>< Pics>

Never will I step foot inside another Chilis establishment due to my experience at the Chilis in Modesto, CA.

I recently moved to the Modesto area from Florida and decided to grab some food and drinks with my sister.

We ordered drinks and as expected the server asked for our IDs, we handed her our Florida issued drivers licenses (we have not been here long enough to obtain CA IDs). What I did not expect was for her to walk away with them with no explanation. After about 5-10 mins, a different person approached us with our IDs and introduced herself as Heather, the manager, and stated that they were unable to accept our IDs and proceeded to explain her reasons:
1.	One of the IDs was cracked. She bends the ID as she attempts to show the "crack" that wasn't there.
2.	One of our IDs had a star and the other did not. SN: Florida licenses have changed within the past few years and each of ours were issued at different times. One is more current than the other. But both are VALID state issued IDs. The issue date is clearly printed on the front of the ID.
3.	It did not match the Florida ID in their "book". As explained in the 2nd reason, the state of Florida has more than one ID type therefore if we're going to be matching IDs to a "book" you need to have all IDs for each state.
At no point during this interaction did the manager offer to accommodate us for the inconvenience and her apology was artificial and insincere. Not willing to tolerate any further disrespect and unwarranted embarrassment we immediately left.

Since the time of the interaction I have spoken with Heather again via phone as well as Ken, the general manager, to understand their procedures and how they could allow potential customers to walk away upset, when we had done nothing wrong.

The attempt to give them an opportunity to at least genuinely and sincerely apologize and or offer a reasonable explanation lead nowhere with no attempt at a resolution on their part. I am infuriated at how poorly this situation was handled and will advise anyone I know against going to any Chilis establishment. Chilis Executives - please better train your management and staff on how to properly and respectfully handle interactions with customers.<//review>

<text>Okay Chili's.. Look. I love eating here, I love the Tropical Sunrise Margaritas and Priscilla (sp?) was a great server last night. We were not in her section, but she took us on anyways. It was about 9:00 last night 11/11/14. We went because, for one, we have been loyal customers for like ever now and absolutely love our experience every time. Two, it was Veterans Day so it was a win win for us. Great food, my fiance got his meal for free. Thank you! So. Anyways.. Let's get to the point. Give Priscilla a raise or something, she was awesome. Also that one guy that I think is a manager in that striped shirt, he was cool too. HOWEVER, like I have already said, I have been a loyal customer for a long time. I order the same thing, without fail, every single time I go in. I order a Tropical Sunrise Margarita, Triple Dipper and a Mushroom Swiss Burger. I can count on getting the same thing every time. I've had Chili's all the way from Modesto, Ca to Denver, Co. You guys are reliable, fast, friendly, courteous, etc. Well, after hundreds or dollars spent, I go in last night to spend another $50 bucks and order the Mushroom Swiss Burger. Oh but wait, THERE ARE NO MORE MUSHROOMS. WHAT!? Can you imagine my surprise? I had my order ready to go even before we got seated. Even before I even got off of work. I had to sit there and stare at the menu for what felt like forever just to figure out a way to cope with the loss of mushrooms. I am not someone to mix things up, but last night I was really thrown for a loop. There are literally no decent Mushroom Swiss Burgers anywhere in my area. Oh my Jesus. How do you just not have ANY mushrooms? For a brief moment, I was lost and confused. I felt like the whole world had come to a stop awaiting my decision. The fate of the world rest upon my shoulders and I had been so unprepared to do something else. I had no plan B. There was never a thought in my mind that I would have to do something different, to take a different route and change my path forever. No mushrooms, you say? Fine, I will bring my own next time. Please tell me that you still have Swiss cheese. Oh, also, DO NOT EVER GET RID OF THE TROPICAL SUNRISE MARGARITA! That will literally send me over the edge. Thank you.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>
