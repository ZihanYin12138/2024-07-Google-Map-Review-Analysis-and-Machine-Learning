When our lease was over, we were supposed to give them a notice a month in advance that we wont be continuing our lease. We were a couple of days late in notifying them in writing that we were not continuing the lease. They said nothing when we emailed them about leaving. Didn't even reply to the email. A month after we had left the place and several emails later they emailed us the final statement and sneakily added $550 for not notifying them about not continuing our lease on time.

We disputed this since if they had told us before that we were paying for the house we could have stayed in the home for longer. No replies on email, no taking our calls. Goes on for months. Then finally a call happens. The administrative staff says they understand the issue and will take care of it. But of course its a lie. They threaten us with suing instead over email.

Do you really want to live at a place where they are trying to find sneaky ways of cheating you out of your money?< /Review>

Stayed in a beautiful apartment from furnished apartment rental company Blueground for a few months. The experience was incredible.

The surroundings of Shadowbrook are gorgeous and the maintenance team responsive. The pool was not accessible due to covid measures.</Review>

<Text>Be very cautious when you are moving out of the apartment. The apartment manager sent us a move out notice on March 5th which said that we had to move out on April 5th. We did move out on April 4th, but now after we move out they add an additional rent for 3 days (i.e from April 5th to April 8th) which makes no sense. If they had informed us that we had to stay for 3 more days we would have stayed.
It is their job to inform us earlier regarding our lease ending and whether we opt to move out or continue the lease. I had to go to their office to check with their offer. And then they send the move out notice on March 5th and expect us to respond the same day. This is ridiculous, do you think we don't have a job to do and we keep waiting for your emails? Don't you think you need to give the residents a buffer time of at-least 2 weeks to make a decision. Since we responded after 3 days they added "late notice fee" after we move. They did not even mention it while we were submitting the move out document.
If they really wanted to enforce that they should have told us we were late when we gave you the notice. If we knew, we would have been happy to move out a few days later to the new home instead of paying rent there. This slipping it in the final bill to mooch some more money from us is unacceptable  to me. Why on earth would we pay rent at two different places at the same time?
I certainly won't recommend people to stay at Shadow Brooks.</Text>< rate>

First of all, we lived here for 5 years. The application process and first year experience was an interesting one-to say the least. Since then, many changes for the better have taken place. We have no complaints about the management or staff (even though many of them have come and gone), everyone took care of our questions and our needs, especially the exceptional maintenance team. The only negative things we can say, is that the rent just kept going up and up and up. No matter what your salary, it is very gut wrenching to see your rent increase when your pay doesn't match that-especially in an older apartment without interior amenities. In Sunnyvale, we found a place that has every updated item and amenity you could imagine. Comparing costs, monthly apartment fees, pet fees and even our moving expenses, we are going to be able to save at least a minimum of 700.00 per month-even up to 1k. We will miss Shadowbrook in many ways, especially the connections we made. We truly look forward to a healthier bank account and a newer home with all the amenities. We wish the team at Shadowbrook all the very best.<//Review>

<Review>I moved into this community early this year and the community is beautiful and quiet. The office was timely with maintenance requests, and the housing portal was very useful.

Unfortunately, a recent housing situation warranted us to push for an early lease termination. We worked with Jennifer from the leasing office and she was very helpful and patient throughout the process :D I would highly recommend living here, and I hope to come back to live in one of their properties in the future.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Shadowbrook was my first apartment complex I rented when I moved to California. It has a beautiful pool and a very zen environment which I miss. It’s fairly quiet and peaceful and a short walk to a park nearby. I also got lucky with very nice and caring neighbors.

The only issue I faced was the rent spike after they installed washer and dryers. Otherwise, I miss my time there.< /review>< Pictures>

<rate>2</rate><Text>I'm about to move into Shadowbrook, but the move-in process has made me think if I've made a huge mistake. There are too many hustles during the move-in, and some of them are completely unnecessary. The community manager can resolve the issue fairly quickly but the assistant they hired is just a nightmare. He will not only ask for the documents you've already sent, but also his passive attitude towards solving your problem/question, and making you no choice but have to escalate the teeny tiny issues to the manager every single time. Don't be surprised if he ask you to bring a check to the office to pay deposit during COVID when he just can't find the correct online portal. I have never complained before but this is ridiculous.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<user_name>Patrick R< /user_name><Time>1606636754052<//Time><Rate>2<//Rate><review>Me and my sister were interested in a two bedroom unit here. The community looked nice online, but we were turned off by the poor experience we had while trying to lease at the place.

I scheduled a self-guided tour on their website and they sent an automated email saying the community would reach out to me to confirm the appointment. They never did. I called the leasing office the next day and they ended up giving me a rushed regular guided tour of a unit similar to the one I was interested in. I asked to see the unit I intended on applying to, but the 'guide' couldn't get the door unlocked.

I did submit an application to hold the unit, but I didn't want to sign the lease blindly - so I decided to schedule a second tour for the actual unit next day. They confirmed my appointment and said see you tomorrow. I show up at my appointment time, and nobody in sight at the leasing office. I called the office number 3 times, all calls went to voicemail. Not a soul to be found around the property except for the residents.

After wasting 30 minutes of my day driving over to take care of this after I already toured the property once before, I decided this place wasn't a good match and requested to cancel my application. They said they'd give us our $300 deposit back, but it would be by check and take several weeks to be mailed in.... in our almost two-month long apartment search, all the other places we applied at gladly gave us a refund directly back to our bank account within 3-5 days.

I know times are tough during COVID and all the staff members were genuinely trying their best, but this was a disappointing experience. If they couldn't even handle a tour request reliably, I don't want to know what it would be like to deal with them as a resident.< /review>< pictures>

Just wanted to add my two sense in about this place we live for quite a long time. It is very pretty here, and now with all that is happening wanted to say glad we are here especially with our mgr, Deborah she is caring and genuine.  Like one other reviewer say that they have seen people come and go, us too, and sometimes the toilet needs help, but overall we love it here and the maintenance guys too.</Review>

Pros:
- Beautiful courtyard.
- Responsive, friendly and efficient maintenance team. I don’t know how they made it, but they are amazing.
- Quiet neighborhood if you picked a good unit.

Cons:
- Front desk and manager are nightmares, they always make mistakes, and you have to argue with them for any little things even with all supporting evidences. Don’t trust them, keep everything documented and prepare your legal team.
Life is beautiful here if you don’t have to talk to the manager nor front desks, most of the time, you don’t. That’s why I renewed the lease twice.
- Ants are true: they always show up at the corners as a surprise during the summer, and I don’t think the apartment is (able to) eliminate them. I used the alcohol spray, it works right at the time, but it doesn’t stop the troop showing up at the next random corner.
- Woodpeckers  became an issue since this Spring: they would come and go constantly pecking day and night right on your roof during Springs and Summers. I don’t think the apartment is planning to treat them either. Of course I reported the ants and the woodpeckers several times.
Enjoy!</Review>< response>

Made an appt at last moment and tour with Jennifer was really thoughtful throughout and compared to the other places I went too this is gonna be my choice, depending on my job status. Jennifer was different than the others I meet at my other tours I had. She was super patient with all my questions. The rent wasn’t the lowest but it stood out the most so far.< /Review>

Nice place with bad management.
The apartments look nice and the amenities are good too. The actual building quality is quite low and the appliances are a joke. Worse aspect: the management. You can safely expect all kinds of inconveniences.</text>

Pros: The environment is nice. The room is large and clean. And the view of living room is amazing. Besides, the maintenance team and customer service are super fast and helpful.

Cons: The first day we moved in, we find thousands of ants inside the kitchen and it grows more and more. Customer service and leasing office help us schedule a pest control and we hope it can got controlled soon.</Text>

I don’t like leaving reviews but I feel after a while this is necessary. A few months back my roommate and I were looking for our next home. We toured at a Shadowbrook with a guy And we saw an apartment  here. He seemed very nice but in the end was very confused, uninformed, or just a flat out liar. We saw a home that wasn’t renovated but had a washer and dryer. Not being renovated wasn’t an issue but we had to have a washer dryer. We ended up loving it and reserved a home that wasn’t available yet for a better price! We were told by the leasing person that it was exactly the same as the home we toured and included washer and dryer but just in another apartment. Fast forward to a day before our move, and we stopped by and asked if we can view our new home. The leasing girl was nice enough to show it to us. We walked in and noticed there was NO washer or dryer! We asked her and she said no this home doesn’t have it. Then we said we were told it did and she looked surprised and said I’m sorry it doesn’t. Then we went back to the office to see if another home was available with Wash and dryer and were told there was for a significantly higher price. We ended up cancelling our move here because we needed a washer and dryer. We already transferred our mail over, had movers scheduled, set up all of our bills and everything. The manager wasn’t sympathetic at all. She was just like well sorry you were informed wrong information and that was it. Given the circumstances we got our deposit back but they didn’t seem to care that this majorly inconvenienced us. Since moving in to our new spot we have not had a better experience, which is what caused me to post about my experience. If you are looking here make sure you know exactly what is inside your apartment<//review>

I don't live here, but I am giving this for the leasing people. There is no respect of time for any appointments. I had booked appointments for shadowbrook and parallel apartments (leasing office is same) but both the times I didn't have anyone in the office, with just having a note, 'sorry we missed you, we' ll be back at xx:xx time' (which was one hour after). I reached on time and there was no followup on emails regarding these even though I had emailed them regarding this.
I wish there was a 0 star possible.<//Text>

<Text>The apartment is great and the maintain staff especially Kyle is very helpful. The surrounding of the apartment is very peaceful and the apartment has some very beautiful sites. Also the apartment are homes to ducks, squirrels and a large number of pets. It is spread over a large area and if you are new you are going to get lost for sure. But this is a perfect place to live in sunnyvale close to El camino and located in the lap of nature's beauty. The leasing office is very helpful but just make sure that you have got the PG&E account number before moving into this place.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This is a very good apartment community to live, overall. Very nice maintenance guys, who are very friendly as well. Good neighbors, even though I don't know them, never had any trouble.

Cons:
Most apartments lack dual pane windows, so noise is on the higher side due to regular maintenance activities going on in other apartments, so if you are a person who works from home a lot, be ready.

Rent increase was $230 for a one bed for 2017-2018 cycle. And there is easily a $100 on top of your rent advertised (monthly)

Extra car parking is paid, but there is always someone who parks in your spot, in the internal community website, this is the top complaint.<//review>< pics>

<Date>1540402842762<//Date><rating>1</rating><review>I lived in Shadowbrook Apartment for an entire year and then signed another half-year lease afterward while looking for buying a house. I thought it would take me a few months before moving to my new house, it turned out I bought my house in only 1 month, so I had to early terminate my second lease. Based on my negotiation with the leasing office, I was told if I could find someone who would like to take over my lease and sign a new one, I wouldn’t be charged the early termination fee except for the rent difference if the monthly rent is lower than mine due to market price change.

However, the gap between I moved out and new tenant move-in is still charged on me. And it took shadowbrook two weeks to inspect and clean up the apartment. I am then asked to pay the prorated rent for the gap which was never told by leasing office.  I tried to negotiate but they sent my case to a collection company. Extremely poor attitude when you are no longer a tenant for them!!!

PS: the early termination penalty is two-month rent if you can not find someone to take over your lease. It is also insane!!!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I originally gave this place 5 stars. When we moved in, the grounds were beautiful and they still are. The amenities are nice as well. So it left a good first impression.

But after living here for most of a year, there are a few big drawbacks that anybody should be warned about before committing to live here.

1. Most of the apartments here are old and haven't been updated significantly in a while. Which means no AC and very old baseboard heaters, as well as single-pane windows and I'm assuming little-to-no insulation. The result is it's hard to keep the place warm during the winter and the electric bill for our 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment costs us over $400 some months. That drops to around $100 during the summer, when we don't run the heat much.

2. After finishing 9 month lease, we were forced to sign a new lease for 9-12 months or face a $1,000 a month increase in our rent. We can't commit to that in our current situation, so we're stuck paying it until we can get out of here, likely having to pull our kids our of their schools mid-semester.

3. They have not done a good job communicating with us. Questions about our lease have gone unanswered even as the due date to sign a new lease was looming. Promises to have management review our rent increase and get back to us have also not happened. And when we went to them asking about the price of a 4 month lease, hoping for it to be a good bit cheaper than the month-to-month, they gave us a monthly price that was actually higher than the month-to-month rate. Which leaves us wondering if they'll raise our rent with each month that we remain on a month-to-month lease.

So while this is a nice place at first glance, be warned, once you've committed, you may be in for some nasty surprises. And I'm assuming these practices also apply to the other Prometheus properties in the area.<//Review>

Pros
- Everyone from the leasing office has been really friendly. Even when we accidentally parked our UHaul in another resident's space (sorry!), they were very cool about the whole thing and made sure to clarify what parking spaces were fair game. They've been good about communicating, as well -- there are reminders for when rent is due as well as detailed notices about construction projects, which is great.
- Maintenance personnel have been super clean, professional, and actually effective -- I had horrible maintenance people at my last apartment complex, so I cannot stress the importance of this enough.
- The path that winds through the whole complex is really pretty and well maintained; there are two ponds with waterfalls that are frequented by baby ducks and their moms. That may or may not be a pro for you, but personally I like have a little wildlife around in the middle of suburbia. It's a nice place to take a short walk around at night, and every apartment seems to have a balcony or patio that faces this path.
- The surrounding area is nice and has a lot of restaurants, groceries, etc., so long as you have a car (it's also very close to Castro street and Murphy). There are restaurants and parks in walking distance, but getting to groceries or the train on foot wouldn't be fun.
- Rent can be paid online and laundry is paid through a re-loadable card, so no more turning in checks or searching for quarters.
- The units are clean and well taken care of. We ended up in one of the few units that has not been remodeled in the last few years (so ours does not look like the photos online), but the appliances are in good shape and aren't particularly old. The carpeting and windows could definitely use an update, but other than that, no complaints.

Cons
- The flipside of the well-maintained plants is that there are ants and other little bugs floating around. No cockroaches or anything particularly gross, but you will encounter small spiders, etc.
- The walls seem to be pretty thin. Thankfully it's a quiet community, but if someone is being loud next door, you will hear it. But that's what happens when you share a wall, so oh well.
- The complex's numbering is a little weird, so delivery people tend to have a hard time finding the correct apartment. A property map would be useful to make sure packages end up at the right place!</review>

This local bookstore combines obscene prices with a complete lack of any local bookstore charm. There is zero atmosphere and rude staff. The only reason they're still around is because of a lucrative deal they've cut with the university, and you're going to have better luck getting non-course readers from Amazon or book exchanges. Usually I love small bookshops but this one is a big exception.<//Text>

<review>It's not a bad place, but not a particularly good one. They have a lot of books for the size of the building, but there aren't many (if there are any) places to read. However, if you're going here, you're probably going to buy a reader/ books for a class at UCSC. It would be cheaper to get the books on Amazon, but things like readers are only available here.

It's no Green Apple or City Lights, but it serves its job.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Always fun to browse their great selection of new and used academic titles that you won't find elsewhere.  Hard to believe I've been coming here for something like 25 years.  Great local shop.< /Text>

<text>I love this little shop. Apparently they're the go to place for UCSC students so they can get busy at the start of the quarter, but I love the slightly disorganized cramped feeling I get when I come into this shop. It's almost like in one of those bookstores in the movies where you find the book that transports you to another land. I almost always find what I want when I come in.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Yey for small bookstores! Staff very knowledgeable and friendly. They did well and were organized for such a small space with so many books. Many professors got there readings bound here and found a lot of textbooks. NOt the best selection for books not for students.< /text>

Excellent selection, cute atmosphere, and friendly staff willing to chat with you. Slightly expensive, which I wouldn't mind so much if my professors didn't make me buy my textbooks from here.</review>

<name>Leah S<//name><Text>The salespersons here are extremely pretentious. I asked for a text book and they treated me as though I was just birthed. As a student who is at an unconventional age to be a undergraduate, this was extremely offputting. I feel for the younger students that must take the brunt of their transgressions every quarter. Pro tip: anything other than readers are likely cheaper on Amazon. Their used books aren't much of a bargain.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1515782155557< /time></record></dataset><record>

<review>Tried exchanging some old textbooks here in order to buy new ones for the quarter and was informed that they do not do exchanges in the first two weeks of the quarter. When I mentioned that this policy hurts students wallets, who are already paying record tuition, he informed me that it was MY fault that I did not exchange these books earlier, even though I had not been informed of the required texts by my teachers before the quarter had started. Afterwards when I informed him that I still needed this certain text for the class, as this store was the only place my proffessor sells the reader, he refused to serve me. Can't understand why he immediately got so defensive about me mentioning that his policies hurt students, and likely negatively effect the most vulnerable students on campus (in socioeconomic terms), guess he cares more about making every little bit of money off them.< /review><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None<//Pics><user_name>prtaylor prtaylor<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Do not buy books here if you need them from school. Use amazon or something else.  purchased a book from here at 3pm for a class. When I tried to return it a few days later, I was told that because it was a book for school during the first week of classes (it was not a textbook though) I had to have returned it before they closed the same day.
The person I spoke to was rude and defensive.</Text>

< review>
In all my years going to a gas station, I have never gone to the air pump in it was automatically turned on by the staff. Great job by this staff on Sunday, September 6th 2020@8am.

Not ot only from a customer service standpoint but from a limiting me to have to go into the store because of Corona virus. I always come here to get gas and happier to do so now</review>

Very good price fuel and a very clean business. They do not have a restroom.  Many times there I paid at the pump but there was no paper to get a receipt.</review>

<text>This is some of the cheapest top-tier gas in the area. There was not a line to fill up and the station looks pretty modern and clean. Easy access from the roadway.< /text><Date>1483403403087<//Date>< response>

The River City Saloon is situated in Old Sacramento and embodies the old west feel of a local watering hole.  Absolutley must get a $.25 sarsaparilla at the bar, stopped in for a quick bite and was satisfied with a couple appetizers. The pool tables in the back were free play when I stopped in which provided a little diversion.<//text>

My best friend and I made this spot our halfway meeting point for lunch for the past year. It has the coolest little decor features such as a Jack Daniel's bottle chandelier and a couple of "regulars" that never seem to leave... 😉  The food is decent, drinks are priced averaged, and the bartenders are always attentive and easy-going.< /Review>

Very disappointed with the environment.   Tons of potential wasted on a fake plastic ceiling,  lackluster pool tables and a music selection that would make any rough neck eat his six shooter.  If it wasn't for the guy trying his best shot to play Chopin over the junk music on the piano in the corner I would have given 1 star.</Text>

< Review>
My family and I have had Kaiser Permanente for 50 years now and I have seen it grow into what it is today.  Their staff has always been caring and very attentive to details.  I do think that you have to be your own advocate for any of your health concerns.  If you want to change Doctors, for what ever reasons, they always accommodate your wishes.  We have had several occasions to use their surgery services and rehabilitation services.  Very caring after surgery care.  Physical Therapy, that was offered during COVID-19, was great,  even on Zoom.  Love Kaiser, don’t ever want to change.  Thanks Kaiser!!<//Review>

Not efficient, I checked in online and they said we don’t do that here, now I am in line and the staff is not opening, it’s 8:15 am and long line outside
This facility is run rather lax

Still waiting outside, no one can open the door and give an update? 8:21am

So getting an automated reply is how much this facility cares< /Text>

<Review>I’ve been with Kaiser for 20 years, and I can confidently say that Kaiser cares about its members less and less. I have seen a very sharp decline in wait times and quality of service. The access to doctors and especially specialists is becoming a joke. In just one month, I have had two appointments cancelled last minute. I had to take the day off each time. Literally, they called me less than 3 hours before my appointment, and the only option was to schedule another appointment 10 days out. I will probably drop dead from a stroke before then, considering I am pregnant with high blood pressure. Thanks Kaiser for making it worth my money (NOT!) and my time to be with you guys. Whoever the CEO is, he/she is slacking and lacking the vision to reevaluate how they take care of their patients. He/she is making poor decisions that do not lead to improvements for the members. They lead to decline in patient health and quality of service. Being a teacher I use recommend Kaiser my family, friends and parents of my students. I must say in saddnessthat I will be looking for a new health care provider next open enrollment.</Review></record>

I’m so frustrated! My daughter has had 3 hypo manic episodes less than 2 months been hospitalized and has been in a mental hospital hold for 14 days. When she was released To the Dr.s at kaiser the following day the Psychiatrist didn’t have the paperwork in hand she said sorry I’m not your phychiatrist but I’ll notate that I advise for you to take one full tablet knowing that she wasn’t making any sense knowing that she still wasn’t in a stable condition she did absolutely nothing. The medications are obviously not working and I fear for my daughters life and safety in the care of these Dr.s that don’t seem to have an urgency. I’m trying to admit my daughter inpatient to get proper treatment and a proper diagnosis but Kaiser doesn’t have any facilities that they network with to provide these options.</review>

I have had a lot of issues with Kaiser.  Not all are from this specific office, but most of them are.

I went to this office and was prescribed an antidepressant.  I told them I would be going back to school, out of state, and if they could send my future prescriptions to a pharmacy near my school.  They said no, but that my only option would be to get it refilled in Corona then have my mom pick it up and mail it to me.  "We have tons of college kids who do this" they said.  "Okay, that's fine, I'll do that."  One month later, I call to refill my prescription.  They say that I have no medications on file!  I tell them about my prescription, and they look it up, saying, "We have in our records that this medication was terminated for you a month ago."  I was prescribed it a month ago!

Okay, maybe because this is a new prescription, they won't do refills unless I talk to my psychiatrist and tell them how it's working for me?  So I call and ask for them to call me with a phone appointment.  12 hours later a nurse calls back and says, "Sorry, we can't get you an appointment with your psychiatrist.  She says to go see a psychiatrist out there and get represcribed the medicine." Well, the first visit to a psychiatrist is $500 out of pocket unless you have insurance.  I have the "Best" insurance there is, Kaiser Permanente.  Unfortunately, they're too cheap to send me to a doctor out here, and they're too unorganized to let me talk to a doctor in California.  And I don't have a basic plan with Kaiser.  I have their highest, most expensive plan they offer.

This isn't the only problem I've encountered.  A few months ago I had severe problems with my tonsils.  They were constantly swollen and painfully bleeding. I asked the office if they would cover me seeing a doctor near my school, and after transferring my call several times, they said they wouldn't cover it.  My only option is to pay out of pocket or to fly to California.  So, after looking at the options, I spent a couple hundred dollars to fly to California.  The specialist told me to get my tonsils removed, and they scheduled me for about a month out.  So I flew back to school to catch up on my classes.  I then flew back to California for the surgery.  I would have flown back a week or two later, when I had recovered, but my throat started bleeding again, and I had to go to the ER, get put under anesthesia a second time in one week, and have bleeding holes in my mouth stitched up and recauterized.< /text>

This review is for Pricilla in the Pharmacy in Corona, California KAISER . What a great person and caring employee. Pricilla helped me to get my test strips for my blood counter for my  diabetes  , I wasn’t able at first to refill my order because it was to early she asked why I was ordering sooner than expected I told her I was being seen by Dr. Nim in Endocrinology and was asked to check sugar 4to 5 times a day . That’s why I have to reorder more strips sooner . But she corrected that and let my Dr. know so he could approve the reorder and he did and I got my strips within 20minutes  while I was there
Can’t thank Pricilla enough she is a very beautiful employee in ALL Aspects again Pricilla thank you Sincerely ( Tony ) God bless you always Pricilla 😉👍

<text>The reception lady on the first floor by the 120 suites billed me $65 for one of my free preventative tests. I knew it was covered but she refused to let me see the doctor without paying the amount. I called member services after my appointment and they said I shouldn’t have been charged and to check after 30 days to see if there’s a credit on my Kaiser account. I mean seriously they have one job and they can’t even do it right? Won’t be coming back to this location. Make sure you know your co-pay and your plan details before coming here because you might be billed incorrectly. I have the receipt and the trans serial number so I’m not sure if John can get her name and have someone tell her how to do her job right.<//text>< Pics>

< review>
Very impressed! I walked in looking for an ER due to some potentially life threatening symptoms. I asked the lady at the front desk where the closest ER was, she asked me a couple quick questions about what was going on, and had a nurse immediately triage me. The nurse was supposed to have gone on her lunch break, but stayed with me for almost an hour to make sure I was stable. They ran some tests and set an appointment with a doctor within the hour. They are not an emergency facility, but every professional I encountered today went above and beyond to help me while I was having a medical emergency. I am very grateful to them all.</review>

***INCOMPETENT COUNSELOR NAMED DANIELLE***
My experience with Kaiser behavioral health department has been stressful and disappointing to say the least. Mainly due to an incident involving one specific counselor named DANIELLE.   Poor communication amongst health care providers  plagues this department from my recent experiences.  If you're in need of counseling for yourself or a loved one please do not allow DANIELLE to treat you.  Very unprofessional, uncaring, dismissive and extremely rude woman.  Expressionless! Flat affect! The worst possible individual to treat a minor.   Its like trying to have a conversation with a door knob!  Health care providers should research patients chart prior to visit to check if patient has had a change in condition. This is best practice when working in patient care. ESPECIALLY PSYCHIATRY!! This allows for provider to be aware of patients current mental state.  I know from my 10+ years experience as a health care provider. No brainer right?!   Due to Danielles incompetence and lack of empathy she has put my family member in danger.   I URGE any mother or father looking for counseling for their at risk teen to avoid choosing DANIELLE as a counselor.<//review>

<text>I like the service when I can get it. If you have a mental health issue that you need continued support on stay away from Kaiser. You're lucky if you can get an appointment in even a few months. It took me 5 months before I got in to see a psychologist and I'm lucky if now I can get an appointment less than a month in advance. My psychiatrist and psychohistory are wonderful but the lack of availability is a huge downfall.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1446015918101, 'text': 'Pardon my typo - the correct email address is KPRiverside@kp.org John'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>provider/midwife Kept looking away no eye contact thru out the visit, almost as she was annoyed/or clueless by what my symptoms were, I felt like that "annoying patient" so i stayed quiet,   it's  not the first time they treat me like this. Im just so frustrated with company. No compassion and they never seem to care about your issues/symptoms . I regret getting kaiser,  i feel stuck, now i have to wait til October to switch.< /Review>< Pics>

I've been a patient of Kaiser my whole life and they never failed me until I needed their mental health services. I've been trying to get an appointment with Kaiser Corona Psychiatry for over a year now. I was being seen at Kaiser for several years prior and at every appointment I was prescribed a new medication that did nothing so I already have my grievances with the psychiatry department here but cannot leave Kaiser. Now that I want to address my issues again and receive proper treatment, I'm being given the run around. Every time I call I'm either unable to make an appointment, get an appointment that the staff cancels or pushes to another date outside my availability, puts me on a waiting list where I never get a call back or gives me the wrong appointment for my needs. I'm beyond frustrated with their inability to help me. Mental health concerns need to be addressed sooner than later, and and at Kaiser they've made me feel even worse and humiliated by not helping me for so long.</text>

<text>First and last time here. The food tasted just fine until I found HAIR in my food. I know it wasn’t mine because I dug it up from the inside of my bowl. I also noticed the girl working there had long hair and it was loosely tied, most of it was down so I assumed it was hers. I immediately took it back to the store and got a refund. This place is a bit too pricey for their mediocre quality anyway. Never coming back here.</text>< Name>

Salmon and tuna with half rice and salad. I added close to every topping. The fish taste clean and fresh along with all other topping. Nothing taste old or that it had been sitting there all day. Around $11 good portion for the price.< /review>

<review>Initially, I let this place pass because of my sushi cravings, because the place i usually get my sushi burritos is in Valencia; but after the last-time I went into Fishbowl Poke to pick up my food, I am never ever going back. First off, I ordered to pick up my food 1 hour and a half before it was even ready. The ordering app kept pushing the time to a later and later readiness time...so I get to the place, and the sign said the place was closed when i clearly saw people walking out with food, so i called the food app in which i ordered, and they said that is lt shows the restaurant was closed. They were about to give me a refund when i told them to wait because i was going to ask inside. So i went in and they are serving a customer who tells me it is closed! So i said: "How can it be closed if i preordered my food an hour ago?" Then, they let me wait inside forever(40 more min). They were really backed up that day, and it was all a big mess! They kept making people leave ssand they were pushing business away as if they had all the clientele in the world, and it wouldn't hurt to lose more.  Furthermore, the worst part is they were so careless because they had their plastic gloves on and off, and they kept touching the screen of their mini tablet as they fixed orders and kept going back to touching food and back and then again, and then the girl that was there kept fixing her pants and lowering her shirt and fixing her bra and chest area, not washing her hands and putting clean gloves on again. Another customer brought that to their attention, and the two guys sort of listened; but the girl didn't care, and continued. That carelessness and grossness is not going into my stomach anymore. That customer told them about cross--contamination and uncleanliness...If someone who inspects their business would have been there, i bet they would have shut them down. That is unnacceptable! Never again.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29bab66387ca7:0x42a810bd09c04d35<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Best Poke place in the valley. There are no limits to toppings, some do cost extra like avocado, but they have a wide selection of toppings and fish. The sauces are the best, the aioli sauce has to be my all time favorite. Service there is quick and friendly. If I am ever around this place, its a struggle for me not to go in and get a bowl, most times I lose that struggle. Highly recommend this place to poke fans everywhere!</Review>< Pics>

Nice place and quite popular, best for take out. Parking is free but close by is always taken. These parking slots are narrow, and the area is always crowded. Food is good, enjoy 👍<//Text>

First time here, only went because they open late. Not the best selection's - on protein's ( the Tuna & Salmon were cut so small, not even worth the $$ ) it would've been nice if Kale ( leafs ) was available..
We grab our "Poke" twice a week in another location.. overall for this place - they need to work on customer service, better in greeting & thank-you for coming in. .<//Review>

It was really good. Just kind of pricey. I guess you get what you pay for, but $20 bucks for a bowl. That's a lil too much. No leftovers either. I'd still go again just not anytime soon.< /Text>

Girlfriend loves this place, however they are really short on staff. Not sure why, but I never see more than 2 people working at a time. Sometimes only one person! Sadly, this can cause a little bit of a line so make sure you can spend the time to wait. But it must be pretty good since my girlfriend likes it so much.<//review>

Best Poke anywhere. Plenty of fish to choose from. They have fish you'll never find at any other poke restaurant like Red Snapper. My favorite is the Spicy Tuna and Red Snapper. Yum!!!!🤤😋<//text>

<Review>It was ok. The serving is kinda small on this place compare to the other poke places I've been to. It's like their scoops are really small and the girl that served me was kind of rushing me so I didn't really get to look at what more add ons I want. Price is about the same to other poke places, just the serving is more limited.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Love this place. The serving portions are a great value for what youre paying. Only complaint is if you go after 9 the picking for toppings are slim and it seems as if the staff just wants to close and not serve. Definitely have better service during the day.<//Review>

< Review>
Husband and I accidently found this place on our way to eat sushi. Seriously best find ever!! All the ingredients are super fresh and the burrito is GREAT! We tried the hot Cheeto covered poke burrito and it did not disappoint. Definitely coming again soon but maybe earlier than 9pm, staff seemed a little bummed everytime a new customer walked through the door.< /Review>

Ordered Zuma bowl and it had albacore and Snow crab. Guy already prepped the meat but I noticed one thing, the crab is imitation crab meat. Guy said it's half and half meaning imitation and real crab. Tried the bowl and i felt like eating a california roll in a bowl with albacore and avocados. Don't mislead with a sign saying Snow Crab when it's imitation crab meat. It kinda ruin my experience.<//Text>

A good poke Bowl but it tends to be a little more expensive than other places like it. Around $14 for a large and that includes a  choice of four proteins.</text>

<Text>This was the first poke place I have tried. That was very lucky because the poke addiction that this place sparked has led me to try others. Unfortunately I have run into places that do not live up to the standard that Fishbowl has set! I am officially a regular!< /Text>< pictures>

Great food and friendly staff. Wish I had the option of choosing which pieces of chicken I want though. Not a fan if dry tasteless chicken breast. Gimme that juicy thigh meat any day.
The waffles were perfect and the option for a sugar free syrup was appreciated. Eggs were cooked to perfection sunny up.
Just need to get rid of that lame chicken breast and the meal is perfect.</Text>

My wife and I both loved the food at this place. They have large portions so bring your appetite. The chicken fried steak was excellent and I highly recommend it. Restaurant has a down home feel to it. We will definitely be back.< /review>

I hate to give any small business a bad rating but if I could give this place a 0 I would. Food is okay but customer service is awful, rude staff o, they don't follow mask requirements for staff, customers, and cooks, they were doing indoor eating even when it was not allowed, and the cleanliness needs some work. When I went in there I called them out on the mask and indoor dining and they literally laughed at me, very disrespectful. There are plenty of other small business to support around here but this one is not the one...</text>

Nice place for a late breakfast. The one girl that was waiting tables for the whole place did an amazing job and so did the cook as everything was great. The location leaves a little to be desired , the old “security “ camper trailer out a k suggests so<//Review>

<review>Being from the south, I am very particular about my fried chicken. I've been around the Sacramento region trying to find good FC, and I've found the ones I've eaten to be lacking. Not here!
Although if they added a little more pepper it would qualify as true southern style, but as is it's very, very tasty. The "crust", as we called it where I'm from, is soooooo good. At my age I generally don't eat chicken skin, but this crust can be separated from the skin. And I have to admit, I ate most of my crust.
Come to the Chicken & Waffles House, if you love fried chicken, you'll love this place.
Oh, and even though the coffee is standard cafe brand, they do brew it good and strong.</review><rating>5</rating><user>109723386090505983821<//user>< Date>

The menu says it's supposed to come with eggs and potatoes but I didn't receive the potatoes. The eggs came with cheese as I requested and were good. The wings were tiny compared to other chicken places around but tasted good. Waffles had good taste but could have been toasted more. Lastly the whole experience was topped off by an older waitress rudely answering my question about the special in the sign outside. Someone please remind me how this place is the best Chicken and Waffles in town?<//text>< rate>

This place Inside reminds me of the way the diners in the past looked. From the seating area to the counter area. Great food, friendly staff who are ready to take your order. Love how they have homemade desert cake to try. From breakfast to lunch this place is a great place to go. With reasonable prices its a must to go and eat.</text>

They also have an early bird SPECIAL, which is from 8am to 10am from Monday to Thursday, but call just to make sure of the hours and days. They give you a card and stamp it every time you have your car washed,  and you get a free regular wash for every 10 washes.  😁😁👍👍< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Response>None</Response><Review>I moved to Los Angeles 6 months ago and have been looking for a good car wash nearly the entire time! I work as a veterinary technician and by default have many fur babies that are in and out of my vehicle, making it an absolute hairy mess. The employees at this car wash were kind, quick and thorough.

Although my Spanish is not what it used to be, they were patient with communicating with me and I will definitely be returning. Thank you so much!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c96ee5759baf:0x51e9b3daad2f0a1d< /Gmap_id></record>

They stole or lost one of my mats and say that there is nothing they can do about it not to mention that they took too long to wash my car and was not vacuumed properly. There was one good kid there that actually took the initiative to re vacuum my car and was very apologetic. I tipped him and offered him a job.
He is very good at customer service but the place he works at is terrible< /Text>

They left the inside and outside of my car flawless!
I recommend getting the Deluxe Special (comes with hand wax).<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80c2c96ee5759baf:0x51e9b3daad2f0a1d< /gmapID><user>116317917615606071846</user></record></dataset><record>

Brought My R33 Gtr here for a full detail. My car was completely dirty from the recent fire and had a kinda of ash and dust inside and out. They took care of me with a full detail. The interior and exterior Was well taking car of from top to bottom and Even took care of my engine bay I am very sensitive about who touches inside that area due to the components I have in there. Everything was to my liking and i will be comming back again. Thank you a very satisfied customer<//text>

Unfortunately someone broke into my car and they were able to replace my window the NEXT day! Very knowledgeable and courteous, the service provided was quite fast as well with it being done in 2 hours!</review>

After walking around the lake for 2 hours I come back assuming it must be done and they lost my number or something, they're fixing 3 other windshields for cars that came in after me. I sit and wait a hour and a half only to look and realize they haven't even started on mine!!! I wish I would of went next door to Auto Glass on the Move. Next time I will. Not sure what I did to be such a low priority to them, finally leaving at 2pm</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

They were able to get me in on a Sunday morning. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The pricing is also reasonable and they did a great job.</review>

The staff at In & Out Auto Glass is helpful and considerate. They have a lot of glass in stock and you can often have their repair done the same day. They are also a great value.<//Text>

Since we live in an urban area where smashing windows is much to much a common occurrence, In & Out Auto Glass is excellent.  We have used them 6 times over the years.  They work with you, your insurance company and provide excellent auto glass service.  Thank you!  Hope we don't need to see you again but if we do, it is good to know you are there.  Plus, they are opening a 3rd shop.  One in SF, one in Oakland and hopefully one soon in the Hayward Castro Valley area.  Yeah!<//Text>

< Review>
Had my car window smashed in one night at the movies in downtown sf😌 so I called in & our auto glass the next week and they came and met me on west Oakland as I was on my way to Emeryville. It took them 15 minutes! Not like some other scams around town that charge you an extra 20% and then make you wait in a hot room without refreshments for 2+ hrs! Madness.

Really bad service and I called over the phone and when I got there I did some paper work and asked the lady how much and she gave me the same price as on the phone but when I was ready to fix the car they gave me a totally different price way higher then the price I was told. TOTALLY DON'T RECOMMEND, SCAMMERS!!<//Review>

Friendly, fast, competent, affordable. They replaced a broken passenger door window (2014 Prius C) in an hour and charged $160, which was a lot less than what one of the big companies had quoted.</review>

<Review>My car was broken into last night and I called my Insurance Company and because I have a $500 deductible and the glass companies that they work with charge less than the $500, I was responsible for the replacement of the window.  Well,  I called around and the lowest quote I received for my window was $308. (I have a jeep and the window that was broken was the passenger rear back door window).  My friend told me about In & Out Auto and was able to get that same window for a total cost offffffff....... drum role please.  $180.  Needless to say I am so happy.  In addition to the cost, the people there were really friendly and the repair was done in 1 1/2 hours .  I'm sure it would have been fixed much sooner but there were other cars ahead of mine.  Oh, and get this.... I asked for a quote for my windshield, because I have several dents in it and one has started to spread... (thanks a lot big rigs on the freeway) well, I was told that it would only cost me $200 to replace it.  I'm sure you can tell by my review where I'll be going.  Thank you In & Out Auto staff.  I'm a happy consumer.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Dropped in late Monday afternoon. Price was exactly as quoted when I called in ($170). Small line, took an hour to install, overall the visit took ~2 hours. Workers left the dashboard covered in old sealant and garbage, as well as big greasy fingerprints on the rearview mirror. But hey, it cost less than $200 and was done fairly fast.<//review>

Aces! I went in there on a busy day, and they still got it down sooner than expected. Plus, a closely comparable price to my usual "cheapest in town" guy ... I hope my car never gets broken-in again, but for whatever reason, if I need a new window on my car fast (as always is the case), I will likely be back. Thanks Jessica and In & Out Auto Glass.< /Review>

Nothing In & Out about it. I chose this place because it was the cheapest I could find in the area. When I called they said it would take about an hour and it was first come first serve. I went today and she said about 2 hours. I waited patiently in their disgusting waiting room and went outside after 2 hours to see they hadn't even started my car. When I inquired she said AT LEAST another hour. Waste of my time and the place is gross and dirty. Broken glass every where. No thanks, I'll take my business elsewhere.< /review>

Colette is fabulous. I've been going to Always Summer for two years now. My first time there I had never had a sugar wax before, and I was pleasantly surprised how much less painful it was compared to a traditional waxing. She's never running behind schedule, better than a bartender to talk to, and has a great atmosphere in her shop. Can't recommend this place enough!<//review>

Been coming to Collette for over 2 years and I love her! She’s so nice and friendly! Her work is great. I get the Brazilian every month. Her scheduling system is great and easy to use or you can always text or email her and she will get back to you in a timely manner. Love her and would and have recommend to anyone.<//Text>

This place is great for realistic spray tans! I recently saw Danielle and she did a great job! She took time to understand the look I wanted and was able to customize the tan in the way I requested. I highly recommend Its Always Summer and Danielle for spray tans. :)</review>

Love love love Colette! She is ahhmazing! I love that she is real and makes a real connection with you. It doesn’t feel like those chain places where it’s all awkward. Everything about It’s Always Summer is super easy - from making an appointment, parking, services, and payment. I’m always in and out within like 10 minutes. It’s crazy to think that I was about to not go to my initial appointment with her because I ended up getting my monthly present and I took that as a bad omen. When I tried to cancel, Colette talked me out of it by reassuring me that she can work around it. I’m glad she did, because it’s been a few years now and it’s been great!</Review>

<review>I started sugaring for the first time several months ago with Colette and there is no turning back, she is amazing! I've been going to her ever since! She makes you feel comfortable, treats you with the best care, and makes sure you leave happy. She is also amazing at spray tanning! Colette recently added lash extension and facial services, I have yet to try them, but she never disappoints! :)</review><userid>103499364594090441129</userid><GmapID>0x80c2b48c11f68c29:0xcf09a7762ce6ff66</GmapID>< pics>

<text>I stumbled across It's Always Summer almost a year ago through yelp when I was looking to warm up my icy winter legs. From my first phone call Colette was super friendly , knowledgeable and attentive to my needs. I loved my first spray tanning which never looked fake or orange and faded pretty naturally. I ended up returning several times for the spray tanning services and then added in the Sugaring as well. So much better that a wax, the products at It's Always Summer are definitely quality and non irritating to my sensitive skin. Over all great company , great experience , I recommend them all the time.<//text>< gmap_id>

I've been getting waxed since I was 17 and I have yet to find a better experience than sugaring with Colette!! She is amazing at sugaring and spray tanning and an awesome person in general. It is always so fun coming into her shop and I leave feeling refreshed and confident.  I can't wait to try out her lash extensions and facials next!
If I could give 10 stars I would, GO TO COLETTE!</review>

Ever since I first walked in, Colette has been amazing!!  She is not only knowledgeable in her products and offers great service, but she also has a great personality which makes the whole experience that much more pleasant.  It is also super easy to book an appointment, which makes it even more awesome since other places I've tried in the past have had huge waiting times and such narrow time windows.  Aside from sugaring, Colette also does spray tanning, lashes and facials.  I have yet to try these three, but if I ever need those services, I would not hesitate to give her a try.< /review><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b48c11f68c29:0xcf09a7762ce6ff66<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

I have been seeing Collette for sugaring for almost 9-months now and am always pleased. Scheduling appointments is convenient and appointments are quick and effective. I have very sensitive skin and have no reactions after seeing her. She is also so easy to talk to so you are distracted from an uncomfortable pain that is unavoidable during that kind of service 😉</text>

I've been coming here for my Brazilian wax for almost a year now. If your local I would recommend getting the membership to get the special member price ($40!!!).

Colette, the owner/manager/waxing diva/spray tan queen, is very easy to work with. She is personable, quick, reliable, and very flexible.

It's refreshing that she uses modern technology. I get a reminder for my appointment via txt and email (very helpful for my busy schedule). After my appointment I pay for it using square, so I get the option for a paperless receipt and make my next appointment. I've had many times where I had to change the date or time and I simply text her at least 24 hrs ahead and she makes the changes. She response to txts super fast too.

When I go in for my appointment I rarely wait. The establishment is very clean, peaceful, and the process is ALWAYS quick and thorough. Five stars!!!</Text>

Colette is amazing! She's my go-to girl for spray tanning. Whether I'm trying to look uber bronzed for a bikini vacation, or just a little darker for an event, her tans always look so natural and last! I always get compliments because people cannot tell it is fake. She's the only person I trusted to give me a natural glow for my wedding day! If you're looking for the best spray tan in the south bay, this lady is it!
On top of it all, she's the sweetest person and makes it fun while you're there :)< /text>

I’ve been getting sugared by Colette since around last summer. She does a fabulous job. Her personality is very down to earth and friendly, and the way she engages you in conversation during the process is a good distraction from a procedure that is otherwise...not-so-pleasant (let’s be real). The office is very cute and chic. It’s also very clean and organized. The location is easy to find and parking in the onsite lot is always easy (I’ve been in the morning and mid- and late- afternoon). Another important thing to note: I’ve never had to wait - she’s always on schedule. Highly recommended!</Text>

<text>So I have been coming to Colette for about a year now and she is absolutely AMAZING!!!! I get the Brazilian Sugar and since I come consistently the pain has lessened significantly and the hair doesn't grow back as quickly. Oh and the prices are super affordable in comparison to other locations that offer sugaring, trust me I have been to almost all of them in SoCal. Plus she always has appointments and she will rearrange her schedule JUST for you!!! I love the convenience, cleanliness, and positive atmosphere of the salon!!!! Trust me YOU WANT TO COME HERE for your sugaring needs! I have referred several friends and they ALL come back!!!! Enjoy and let me know how you like it!</text><date>1449872468132<//date></record></dataset><record>

By far the best of the best. Spray tans are organic, natural looking and you can rinse hours afterwards (instead of having to sleep in the solution)

Lash extensions are so easy and again, natural looking. I love, love, love Rachele and how patient and perfect she is with the process.

Sugaring service are fantastic and recently they added fire & ice facials- it is truly a one-stop shop for all of your beauty needs, at a fair price, in very clean surroundings. I love this place.<//Review>

<review>Colette is seriously the best. I have not found anyone who is as knowledge, professional, and down to earth as she is. I will never, ever go anywhere else for sugaring or spray tans. They turn out perfect every time, and her prices are very affordable. All of my friends only go to Colette, and she is so amazing that my mom is now a regular too!</review><user_id>115126809921919344332</user_id>< date>

<Text>Absolutely LOVEEE Collete. She is warm and friendly and an excellent provider for sugar waxing! I had waxed before, but never tried sugaring. Now I am hooked! I see her every 4 weeks since her maintenance pricing is reasonable. Her location is very cute, cozy and CLEAN which always makes my visits nice. Very easy to share your request and needs with, and always available for appointments other than those posted should you need it.< /Text>< rating>

<Text>I started seeing Collette almost 2 years ago for spray tanning, I have been addicted since. My Spray tan is never streaked, always looks natural, and last!!! She works around with my schedule and is always accommodating!
Then... I tried sugaring! THIS CHANGED MY HAIRLESS LIFESTYLE! I sugar every 8 weeks, as oppose to 4 weeks like regular waxing. I have less and less hair grow back every time I do it. It is one of the best things I have ever done, and I am so happy to have met Colette!!!
If you're considering It's Always Summer, do it!!! You wont regret it!!

<text>I decided to cut back on makeup for spring & summer - lashes were the only thing I needed to complete this look. Thankfully this gem popped up in Google search! Oh my goodness! I wish you could see how amazing my eyelashes look. Such an amazing job and worth the time & money! Cheers to happy pores<//text>< Gmap_id>

I am so excited that eyelash extensions and facials are now available as well! I didn't think this shop could get any better! I love the products she sells and always leave my appointments satisfied.

Recommending It's Always Summer for your Spray Tanning, Sugaring, Facials, and Lash Extensions needs! Never get waxed again! Sugar sugar sugar baby! Colette is the best, making you feel right at home every time and did I mention she does amazing work, Spray tans are flawless and beautiful!! Wouldn't go anywhere else!﻿< /Review>

I have HAD IT WITH At&T!!! I had issues with them 13 years ago when I first moved into my house so I never signed up with them. I clearly have a NO SOLICITING sign on my door and my dogs go crazy when someone knocks on my door. What do they do today? That's right, they knocked on my door when I CLEARLY have a no soliciting sign on my door! If I could give them ZERO stars I would.<//Review>

I went in to get the glass protector put on my new phone and Lorenz went above and beyond for me. He took time to make sure it was absolutely perfect while teaching me how to do it myself. He saw me struggling with my clear phone case afterwards and helped me put that on making sure that everything was perfect once again. Made the entire experience quick and painless.< /review>

Horrible customer service from the “new manager” Yesenia. She was in a hurry to get out of there and pretty much insulted my husband. We have been with att forever but after dealing with her...I just have no words or I’ll just get upset again. I hope Att reevaluates her position. Notice the attitude in the picture below.</review>

I had the opposite experience a couple days ago with one of the female salespeople when I came in to purchase a new phone. I won’t mention her name but I was very put off by her aggressive sales approach. It felt like an interrogation and I really didn’t appreciate being asked “why?” every time I told her I wasn’t interested (in the multiple products she tried to talk me into.) I’d much rather do business again with Lorenz.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Made it to the store with a few minutes before 6:00 on Sunday.  Andres AT&T Representative was very helpful in getting my iPhone working again.  For some unknown reason my SIM card wasn’t responding.

<review>Lorenzo was very knowledgeable about product and plan info. He made sure to explain the plan options that would best fit my wants and needs. I would give this guy a raise if I was his boss.  Personable, professional, and the best screen protector installer I’ve ever met.

Chris, was very patient and helpful during my visit today. I came in with so many issues with my account. He was able to resolve it very fast. He was knowledgeable with handling my issue. I found his help was far more better than the apple support representative I was provided that only caused me more frustration<//Review>

Daniel was amazing !!! He helped me tremendously and we got lines that I wasn't using took off, another line added, and an unlimited data plan for a price that I can definitely afford. I can honestly say he is the most truthful sales representative that I have ever worked with at at&t!!
Thank you so much!!</text>

While it never got resolved the way it should have been, it was not his fault and he did everything he could to help.

<Text>Patty was awesome and definitely played a huge part in my decision to switch my wireless service provider to AT&T. I came into the store I decided but after the customer service Patty provided, it was an easy decision to switch. She was very knowledgeable of the products, listened to what I needed and recommended the perfect plan and phone for me.

Patricia DeWeerd assisted my husband cancel an online IPhone 12 order he placed yesterday and assisted him place his order in the Vacaville store so that he could have the new phone today. She explained the process step by step and was professional, patient and most pleasant. She went above and beyond in making the whole customer experience positive. She is so kind and has a wonderful personality and provided the best in class customer service! Thank you Patricia! Thank you AT&T!< /text>

Lorenz went above and beyond our expectations when we went in for a phone upgrade. He was very straightforward in pricing and made sure we had the best deal. We needed to wait for my boyfriend’s phone to complete a data transfer, but the time flew by talking with him. We left as extremely satisfied customers. Thank you, Lorenz!!</review>

I wouldn’t go to this store. We added a new line and were told we couldn’t trade in or upgrade a paid off phone. It met AT&T upgrade eligibility through the website. They said we couldn’t upgrade due to them thinking we were committing fraud.

The store reps don’t know their own company. Immediately after, I called customer service. Customer service told me since it’s a new line, you can upgrade after 14 days. I feel bad for the manager of this store, because if you took Business 101 in college, you learn that business is essentially about making profit. The fact that he didn’t want to upgrade us, he loss out on a huge chance to make more revenue for their store.

My Dad, who’s been a financial manager for 40+ years, knows way more than this manager. If a customer wants a product, you sell it. It’s that easy. I pray for this manager because with his rules, this store will easily be closed in the future. Good luck bud, hopefully AT&T pays for you to take business 101.

To the Manager: Per company policy, you’re wrong. It’s two weeks to get a new phone from adding a new line. I have email traffic proving it.

On the better note, I can’t wait to see you in two weeks to get our phones. 😊</review>

Just have to say I was have a horrible day before coming down to a local att store looking for a gift. I meant Patti and she started helping me with a last minute Christmas gift. I had to find a iPhone 12 max pro in stock for my oldest daughters gift under the tree. Patti helped me through everything, she did t give up until I left with a phone in hand. I have to say she went above and beyond to make me a satisfied customer. After the say I had this was what I call a “Christmas miracle” meeting Patti. She truly made my day and also is gonna make my daughters Christmas! Also found a way for me to save money with a better plan!

I highly recommend if you are in need of att help come down to Vacaville and see Patti.</review>

She verified that everything was working and checked my account to see if I qualified for any additional discounts. She noticed I was paying for two iPad lines and asked if I needed more than one, when I told her that I only needed one line, she informed me on how to cancel the one I didn’t need. I was initially upset with my AT&T/Firstnet service, but Gisselle made sure I was a satisfied customer when I left. THANKS Gisselle!<//text>< pics>

Rosanna the AT&T associate was easy to work with. I told her exactly what I wanted, she gave me a few options, she set me up, and I was out the door. She wasn’t trying to push anything on me, she help me set up my two new phones, it was seriously the easiest transaction. Thank you Rosanna, I will definitely be coming back to see her should I need anything else !< /text>

Daniel was very knowledgeable in his position with AT&T. Not only did he give me a new number for my daughter but he also gave me a new plan that saved me money and gave me so much more for what I am paying. I highly recommend asking for him if you go to this location.<//review>

<date>1602121415399</date><rate>1</rate><Text>I initially went to try to exchange a defective phone that I had just bought 3 days prior as the speakerphone had stopped working, and I was told the store just didn't have the 11 Pro in stock so to try another store or return to that store at a later date. So I came back to the store a few days later (11 days after purchasing the phone) and was told by Terrence and Mikayla (manager) that I would be charged a re-stocking fee in order to exchange a defective phone they had sold me without any attempt at customer service. When I brought up that I had previously been told that it could be a simple exchange since it was within a 14-day window, I was told to go through the warranty with Apple for a new phone or see if Best Buy would be able to exchange the phone. Best Buy was shocked at the poor service I had received at AT&T and the fact I was told they would exchange a phone that had not even been brought from Best Buy in the first place, they did offer to start the Apple warranty process through Geek Squad but it would mean being without a phone until the new phone was shipped to me. So I called the Apple customer service line which informed me that AT&T should easily be able to exchange with no charge since it was already determined to be defective and not damaged. So I called the AT&T customer service line where they also told me I should be able to exchange the phone in the store without any additional fees, but they would be willing to start the exchange process over the phone and ship me a new phone as soon as possible. Basically I spent all day doing the work of the representatives that were refusing to help or be understanding of the situation and making up policies that according to both Apple and AT&T corporate do not exist.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1602284812896, 'text': 'Hello Leslie Hopper, This is not the experience we wanted you to have.

Went to the Gateway store and customer service was horrible, so decided to head to Vacaville ATT. Customer service there was 100 times better and my rep Dontrail was awesome. He took the time to explain any questions I had, was extremely nice, and knowledgeable of the products. I will definitely be going back there again< /Text>

I went in to the store after getting the run around from the customer service number. Asurion messed up my order and sent a phone I DID NOT WANT . Chris  got me the information I needed helped me get in contact with asurion and they fixed the issue. I will definitely be back when it's time to upgrade.</review>

Chris at the Vacaville ATT store was AMAZING!! He was extremely professional and had me in and out of the store in the quickest time possible.  He was extremely knowledgeable and even showed me new ways to use my phone. I highly reccomend if you go to the Vacaville store ask for Chris. He will have all of your questions and concerns addressed and taken care of.<//Text>

Solid store with good employees. I found my experience at the store always depends on the sales rep helping me. Some of the employees in store only care about helping people who will be lining their pockets by the time they walk out the door but majority are far more helpful. Definitely call ATT customer service for technical issues before going in store as this is what they will be telling you to do anyway.< /text>

Only give it 2 for the cleanliness and pleasant greeter. AT&T is a tough company to work for in the wireless sector. They give those people little room to negotiate, that's why T-mobile does so much better. After18yrs of being a customer they could never budge on int'l rates...tough crowd. T-mobile had no problem working with us.< /Text>

< review>
Worst sell phone experience of my life. I normally never give a bad review.Not the way one plans to spend their Birthday. My husband and I already knew what we wanted and had talked via chat with At&t online. The store worker acted like we were an inconvenience, I'm sorry that I can't remember her name. If you don't know cell or contacts learn before you go into this store. I'm so happy I have cell knowledge and sales experience. This young woman misled information, gave incorrect information, and I what I would call a lie. She talked so fast that I asked her to repeat things more than once so I could explain what she was trying to say to my husband... He isn't old, she just talked that fast. She acted like or had little to no  knowledge on the new Samsung 10 phones, while looking up information on the phone I asked about the camera different between the two different Samsung 10 phones and she could even explain what kind of camera it was. When I explained the information to my husband and again we told her from the start what we wanted and went to start the new contract she told us she couldn't because the people that needed to change information their office is closed at 6pm.<//review>

I am not sure why this At&t store has so many bad reviews. I called ahead and made an appointment to upgrade my phone, and I was in and out of there in no time. Everyone I interacted with was very professional and helpful. I had a great experience even though the store was very busy. Maybe the trick was to plan ahead?< /Review>

They need better educated reps and shift manager at this location.  A shift manager who couldn't do basic arithmetic and some staffs who couldn't managed reading comprehension. Don't go to this location for helping with billing issues.  Don't go to this location if you need help with AT&T Prepaid.< /Text>

If I were able to post without providing a star I would. I thought they had good customer service, so I drove 15 minutes to their store when I was less than 5 minutes away from an AT&T Store... bad call! I walked up to the door, which was opened by a sales representative. No one asked could they help me or if I had an appointment. I proceeded to the phone I wanted to upgrade to to "look interested" and still no one approached me. I went to the phone cases and did the same thing. I looked back and there were about 10 sales reps all standing by the door, clueless, with a look of anticipation on their faces for a customer to walk through the door. HA!! I walked out! I sat in the car for a few minutes and decided to go in to inform them of their customer service issue. I walked back in and was approached by a friendly sales rep and I asked her could she tell me where the nearest AT&T store was? She told me their store was. I proceeded to tell her about my experience and that I would not be spending any money in their store. Had I been approached earlier I would have gladly completed my upgrade. The manager is clueless and should probably take notes from the manager in the Fairfield store. Yes, Fairfield has a long wait time, but they are working with less than half of the employee's Vacavile has!<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Have an Asus Zenphone 2E that I bought 4 days ago at a different store.  The phone shuts off randomly, I have to turn it on about 20 times a day.  Asked for a replacement, but they wouldn't do it because I have to be added as a 'privileged' user to my parents phone plan.  They suggested I bring my parents into the store, who live 4 hours away.  No resolution to my problem, I am stuck with a bad phone until I can get with my parents and get into a store.  This store and company have terrible customer service, I am glad I pay money to them monthly.< /text>< pics>

I would give negative star for the horrible customer service and how terrible the internet and cable service is, feels like I have old satellite service where you lose service off and on during a wind storm. When asked what the problem and doing test I was told they would need to send a tech out and run test and would be a charge $99 if they found something wrong with my equipment. Well my equipment will not cause the cable to lose signal all through out the day and was not able to work from home.

Paying my AT&T bills in a AT&T Store is a chore. Nobody will take your payment. You have to use the self service kiosk. I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT!!! I pay too much per month to have to use a self service payment kiosk. No other company that I know of does this. The AT&T staff should take and process your payment for you.<//text>

If you aren't there to spend money, on something new, they don't want you.  Even if you need help with something that you've had and been paying for, if its not a new sale your not important.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Bad service and racists make you wait for more than an hour and when it's time for you they do not want to attend you and they tell you that you can not get the service without checking why, that is called racism
