Great place, I have been going since I was 7 or so. It's a great place for me since I'm just looking for a quick, simple, consistent, and friendly service that always takes me just 20 mins for the same short haircut I've had forever. It's also next to the donut place with great croissant sandwiches, making regular haircuts an exciting thing.< /text>

So I've taken my son her 3 times the first time they did a fair job. I still had to go home and cut some stays, the second time I took him, I had to go home and fix it because it was in even at the top. Now this being the last and final time, I took my son in and asked the lady to trim and even out the sides... she cut off both sides, one side she left super uneven and with stays all over. I don't know what even made her think I wanted my 5 year old to have a military high and tight. I've asked other barbers do to the same and I've had no issues until now. I figured she'd understand I wanted the sides trimmed and faded. I guess it was partially my fault for not explaining myself, but at the same time. I didn't ask for a high and tight.... this is the last time I'll be taking my kids here. I'm very disappointed, every time I took him there I had to come home and fix and finish the job I paid the barber to do.</text>

Lady with the black curly hair and dyed blonde hair are speaking bad words towards customers I heard them making fun of people in spanish about some elderly people and some kids getting hair cuts that only knew english calling them nasty & ugly & dumb people. Haircuts were quick & careless. Make rude faces and roll eyes. Eating & snacking on the job. Dont wash or disinfect their tools like scissors, combs, shavers after each customer. Just horrible!

<Text>(Translated by Google) I never come back, worts place ... The worst place for a haircut ... my son cut all his hair with no. 2 ... I did not ask for that, in less than a minute they made her hair cut ... they should put a sign, we do not cut the hair to children of 3 years ...

They had everything I wanted when I went in there and more t-shirts were reasonable thermals were reasonable I didn't buy them but they were so reasonable that I felt like I should have bought some it gets kind of crowded at times but it's worth it as a store that you want to go to if you need to grab something real quick<//text>

I have been a customer for a long time, love the energy, how nice & friendly staff & ownership.  Water is very important & knowing that politicians, water department, & bottled water companies are in bed with chemical companies &  giving us reclaimed water, no way would I give that to my family & friends, not even to my dogs.  I am a customer for life. thank you Einar for the best alternative.<//text>

<review>The Water Brewery is the only place I recommend to get the highest quality water. The A.M.O.R.E. water is my all-time favorite and I love adding the boosters as well. The customer service from their team is always awesome. The owner, Einar, is kind and delighted to share his knowledge if you have questions about anything. I have been coming here for years and I want to drink this water for the rest of my life. It is my pleasure supporting this business each week.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dd208b11521803:0x5f751dbf6e8081c0</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you're looking for bulletproof coffee and some real unique pastries  (gluten-free friendly food). The food at TWB#2 is really good too! The staff is always so mellow and cool. Love this spot! :) everyone is so happy in that place. Love it!<//review>

<review>These guys are the best.  Customer service is bar none.  Always very friendly, very professional, very knowledgeable and very efficient.  Can't wait  for their new delivery service, since I can no longer lug the bottles from auto to home.  No issue from brewery to auto, since the employees are more than happy to help.  Can't say enough about this place.  Get your water here.</review>< pictures>

I'm upset with myself that I've lived in the area for nearly a year and made my first foray into The Water Brewery this past weekend. They've got a very cool vibe right as you walk in, with helpful and friendly staff who walk you through the different offerings of water.

The real treat though, lies further back in the smoothie/tonic/elixir bar area. Extremely high quality ingredients make for potent concoctions.. I'm going to have to allocate a non-insignificant portion of my budget to this place, as I simply can't wait to try out everything on their menu.<//Text>

<Text>Absolutely amazing. Came out from Texas to visit a friend and try out local food and coffee. From beginning to end it was a pleasant experience, wonderful drinks, customer service was friendly, and the almond cookies were astounding. To top it all off they let us refill our water bottles with their fantastic water. Highly recommend.<//Text><user_id>101186016441018227260<//user_id><response>None</response></record>

<Text>This place is amazing. Try their food, very high vibe and healthy. Been drinking their water for 5 years, and have recommended this place to many friends and family members. Would rate more stars If I could. Their bliss water is unlike any water I have had. Close to perfect.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is nice. Prices are super cheap / reasonable for what I'm buying at least. Dude behind the counter keeps it cool and friendly. I go back because dude is cool and prices are cool. Top notch smoke shop<//Text>

I walked in not knowing what to expect since the location was convenient to where I was at. I had broken the glass on my vape and needed a replacement. Not only did Frank have what I needed, he promised to order in whatever juice was my favorite and keep it in stock for me next time I came back. Literally one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. Love this place!<//Text>

Less expensive gas comparatively speaking. Basic quick stop supplies and snacks. Pump area is always crowded. No windshield cleaning supplies.  Masks required for service.  Pump area dirty, wear gloves.< /review>

I have known this family for over 15 yrs. They are honest and respect the social distancing and mask wearing. Good prices 🙂 and pleasant service. Support for our local community.<//text>

Cheap gas but the pumps need maintenance. First pump wouldn't  read cards, second pump read card and charged me a .50 fee but would not pump gas. 3rd times the charm or should I say #5 is the charm bc I actually got gas out of this pump and charged another fee.</Text>

<text>Even when the gas station is closed you can still get gas at the pump using a credit card.  Sadly it is a little unfair to charge a fee for using a card at the pump.   Sometimes it can be a pain in the backside after paying at the pump to go in to get a receipt inside the store because there is not receipt paper in the pump.   If it was occasional it would be one thing but it's regular.  Staff though are polite.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80db6f658246601f:0x3b85736fd8f13be3< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Chad Merritt< /user_name><Text>If I could not select a star I would not. Zero stars is my true opinion of this place. The lady that operates the store is constantly trying to over charge the customers. Keep an eye on the register and the price stamp indicated on the product you buy. It is her common practice and not just an accidental one time circumstance. I will not be going there for any purchases again.< /Text>< user_id>

<rate>1< /rate><userid>110998376190184524887<//userid><review>I would give this store the worst rating in town !!! I went in on 10//3/15 to get $15.00 for gas, a pack of smokes and a drink, the receipt said $22.00 but later I checked my visa card and it said this store took out $59.00 !!! It cleaned out my card leaving me $3.00 !!! I went back to tell them and the older lady (who was very rude to me as if I was lying)  at the counter said it was the fault of the card.. not the store... I talked to another man who works there and he said the same thing and that my card would show a credit back on it in a few days.  I even let the man from the store talk to the agent with the card who told the store worker that they needed to refund me because this store charged $59.00... the workers still refused to refund me and will not tell me who is the owner or boss of this establishment.  I can not believe that these workers in this store can continue to get by with this.... they are making 1000's of dollars doing this to our cards !!!!!</review>< response>

<text>The manager greeted me warmly and explained how and what the protocols are. Then she introduced me to Kiara an awesome young woman who helped me from beginning to end. Can’t remember when I’ve enjoyed shopping so much! I’m going back tomorrow.
BTW awesome sales! Thank you ladies!!!< /text></record>

She gave my my first fitting (at nearly 28 years old), told us about all kinds of deals and coupons, and by the end of my visit left with 6 pairs of panties and a new bra for $67. If you're a plus sized girl, you know that's about the price you pay for ONE BRA at most places. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this store. 💜</text>< pictures>

The associates and the manager here are amaizing. The best shopping trip I have ever experienced. These girls went out of the way to make me feel good in a donating situation. I needed to get bra fitted and the Staff including the manager went out of there way to make sure I had the proper fit and the right style. They also helped me with clothes and ordering something they did not have to be sent to my house. They spent so much time and effort to make sure I was happy.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809b21d37a7563df:0xadc3dc2d0d734f03</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

No longer open until 7, if even 8 which is what the online and phone service say. I drove to another town for my needs and the sign on the door says they close at 5 now. This was the only day I could make it out here before my trip on Friday. Going to have to go someplace else for my needs today. Im disappointed. I Checked online and called the automated system both gave hours of 7 and 8.<//Review>

This is my go to store ever since they opened at the Gallery.  The manager is fabulous, she knows her products inside and out. She will help you with clothing, shoes, swimsuits, accessories, even get you into the right Bra for your body shape.  She's the best...< /text>

Extra kudos to Amber most helpful lane Bryant employee I have ever met!!! This is not my closest Lane Bryant but I pretty sure I'm going to travel the extra miles to come to this one from now on!

<review>Wow!! I had the most positive & pleasant shopping experience today with Shannon at the Lane Bryant @ the Fountains Roseville, Ca.  I cannot say enough good things about her excellent customer service & knowledge of LB intimates. I explained what I was looking for, my problem area, she did a fitting, knew exactly what would work best, made the sale. That quick!  I was dreading this shopping trip but ended up being super happy & excited. She will definitely be seeing me in the future! So refreshing to get a employee who knows their product and goes above& beyond to please the customer!!  Thank you, Shannon!!< /review><Time>1509142847161</Time>< name>

Great church. You will notice there are A LOT of people who attend here, and it's because they have a great environment for all people with many different backgrounds. Great worship music, with live band worship team. Very nice people, and something for every age too.< /review>

They are so kind to my dad who’s house was burned down in the fires. I’m so grateful. I live on the East Coast, and he wanted to stay near Paradise to get back and see the wreckage of his house. They are proving so much for the victims of this fire.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I personally dnt go to church but my family goes to this one. And they have a nursery. Two. Different ones for different ages. And I started sending my son with my aunt wen he was a baby as a way to start socializing him from a young age so he'd one day be ready for school. He's now almost 6 yrs old & has a little brother who also goes with him and they both love it! I've met sum of the ppl & my Aunt volunteers in the nursery. They're real nice.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The pho dac biet was decent but that bbq beef was just way too sweet. The pho was about $13 and it tasted fresher than the one from Pho Vy. The bbq beef was about $12 and it was a lunch special that included a questionable-looking salad and soup (it had one tasty wonton). The rice noodles (with the bbq beef) was very dry so I dipped it into the free soup. Would come back for their pho but probably not going to be adventurous.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This is our absolute favorite place to get pho. We have been to many places in Southern California (San Diego, Oceanside, LA, and Riverside), and even some locations in Las Vegas and Phoenix area, and nothing beats the flavor of the pho broth at Saigon in Bakersfield!! The bahn mi sandwiches are delicious too, as is the chicken curry (add mixed vegetables, it's worth the extra price, is delicious, and makes it enough food for two people!). The owners and staff are beyond friendly and amazing people, and the interior decor of the restaurant is adorable! I love this place and highly recommend it!! We come here several times a month during regular operations, and never regret it.

I read a few of the bad reviews here on Google, and I am very skeptical about their validity; one bad review is clearly for the wrong restaurant, as Saigon is definitely not a buffet. I will say I almost never leave reviews, but this restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in Bakersfield and I suggest you give it a try!< /review>

< Review>
Not the best buffet but good for the value and variety. We came here for dinner with a pretty large group. The staff was friendly and accommodating.

A few of my favorite items from here was the prime rib, their pizza was pretty good. Carving station also had turkey that was moist and delicious too. But the prime rib was the best. Their gelato was really good too, the coconut one was my favorite. And my other favorite dessert was the cream puffs.</Review>

<Review>This afternoon I've ordered a Special beef noodle soup,  $ 6.99 and a beef with broccoli dinner,  10.99 according to web site info. When I went to pick up my order I was asked to pay over  $ 46.00 and was informed to my surprise that one of the item I've ordered
two servings which I had no knowledge about. After corrections I left with paying almost $ 32.
Above all this the liquid for the soup/ never in its life saw any beef, I was supplied with a pound of rice and another pound of alfalfa of which upon tasting it gave me gag reflex almost throwing it up, beeing of eastern European decent it is behind my understanding how can people consider this horse food as compatible for human consumption.  Anyway, the tiny cup consisting of little beef and vegetable was kind of tasty but the paper thin pink looking beef did not remind me of anything tasting like beef. The noodles were of artificial looking, like made from plastic and devoid of any taste other than plain tastless water, so In my frustration I throw the big mound of rice into the microwave with a bunch of grated cheese on top of it so I can supply my body with some calory rich food after a hard day's work.
Of course I don't have to tell you that also that pound of horse food went right into the trash can since there are no horses around here.
One thing is for sure that it is highly unlikely that I ever again visit this place in the future.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Service was nice, food was good, also close to the freeway, but overpriced for Bakersfield. I'm from the bay area and there are many Vietnamese restaurants that are better charging less then they do here.

This adds a bit of time away from Highway 5, but the reviews are decent and they have air conditioning. An open space, haphazardly decorated with bits of love and attention here and there. Large menu with some more exotic and fun choices, for example, the ice cream in a coconut shell and banana leaf steamed sticky rice and mango slices. The pho broth may have too much msg. Bahn mi sandwich had a nice French baguette bread. Spring rolls were lacking in flavor and ingredients. A small, friendly mother waitress with exuberant energy was happy to serve everybody.< /Text>

Very good food, I had the spicy beef pho. Prices were pretty good ($8 for pho). Staff was also very nice.< /text>

<username>Chao Wang<//username><userid>104580316361382471519</userid><Review>3 start for food -aerage taste; and 2 start for service. Broth a bit too sweet. If you love pho, it has limited options (maybe 3 or 4 types) they do have more entree dishes than average Vietnamese place but we didn't try any. Beef texture is hard.

Service-wise, we ordered multiple noodle soups to go and asked for a few small bowls so we can serve kids. and they charged us 25 cents a bowl. Am not completely happy, but after 10hr drive, I just want a pleasure meal. We have asked for to-go foods all the time and no one charged extra for this. Again, it's fine they do, but i do expect that as a service from the owner. I always tipped restaurant owners who are helpful and I can't say that in this case. Again, I hope it's incidental. Happy holidays then ...<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Bad quality. Very unprofessional staff. Restaurant looked too old and dark, No other customer  was in the restaurant and I asked staff if I can change my table and sit on kind of lighter area, she said no!  Super dirty cups with broken parts.. broken spoon..portion of the regular size was very small, over priced.. weird color and the taste especially the taste of beef was so strange, low quality noodles. The root and basil that come on the side looked too old. My first and last time trying this place. Have no idea why  some people gave it good reviews.</review>

Great food. The parking was a little tight but okay. Service was good as far as turn around for the meal, but the staff was a little overworked since it was busy when I showed up. All in all a worthy and worthwhile destination.< /text>

The food was really good.  I'm giving it 3 stars because 2 bowls of pho, 2 drinks and spring rolls costed 48 dollars way overpriced for Bakersfield . 4 dollars for a regular soda!!! I usually go to New Saigon on Union.  I would have paid half the price for similar food and quality.<//review>

The food was perfect. Tasted like the Vietnamese food I remembered. The price was just. The ambience was ok, but I didn't felt like I was in Vietnam which would have been a plus. The staff was very friendly. Too bad I am leaving tomorrow, I won't be able to go back.<//text>

The beef noodle soup was delicious and there was plenty to meet my desire.  The banana sticky rice with mangos left much to be desired.  The chef was definitely on vacation when this over priced recipe was created.  The banana rice was salty or possibly a combination of salt and msg.  The white sauce was a white tasteless glob.  The ripe mangos were perfectly ripe and sweet.  I tried two dishes and one was good therefore  the stars end up the same,  in the middle< /review>

Over priced, poor customer service, mediocre pho. They will sell you all condiments/garnishes separately. They seem to only give good customer service to the other Vietnamese. We were treated like second class citizens in comparison.</Review>

<review>This is the best Pho in Bakersfield, and it isn't even close. The spring rolls are so soft, that they remind you of Dim Sum shrimp dumplings. The broth in the Pho Tai is beautifully seasoned. You get cilantro AND Basil and instead of lime, they give you some sort of orange/lemon/lime hybrid. The whole thing is fantastic.< /review>< Rate>

Big disappointment.  Expecting more from a 4.5* location.
-The Bánh xèo (Vietnamese savory crepe) was good 5 stars
-The bò kho (Vietnamese beef stew) was terrible,  so not made correctly 1 star
-The Bánh Mì Dặc Biệt (Literal translation is Bread Special, this is Vietnamese sub with various meats) The pork used was oh so wrong, should be head cheese. There was no butter and it had tomatoes.  I mean I like tomatoes but it doesn't belong. 1 star</Text>

<Text>Portions are small. Price is on the high side. Food tasted mediocre. Tradional, but mediocre!  Service was okay. They had an older lady serving and attending the whole place. 🤔 (NOT cool!) Did not look very clean... I will definitely not be returning!<//Text><gmapID>0x80ea6a0250ca75eb:0xad786950c9ed86cb</gmapID>< Rate>

First time visit 5-23.  I look for chicken pho...it's kind of my Vietnamese passion and the pho (N2 on the menu) was probably some of the best I have had.  Also ordered pork and shrimp egg rolls which were also good but the pho is the reason for the 5 stars.

Service was fast and friendly by multiple employees.

I will go back.  Probably a lot.</Text>

Cheap ingredients (noodles were poor in quality as soon as u picked up the noodles they were breaking). Dirty silverware, sticky tables, dirty cups with lip stick stains YUCK!!! Most importantly poor customer service. Don't eat here because I would never do it again... Try Pho 88 or Maui pho if you want good quality pho.</Review>

<Text>My one and only spot I got to for Pho in Bakersfield. Surprisingly we have plenty of other places to go to here but I would rather come to Saigon. I feel like it's more authentic, like how we would make it at home. But what makes me like this place more than the others is that they have alot of other Vietnamese dishes other than spring rolls, there's more to Vietnamese food other than Pho. Try the vermicelli with charbroiled bbq pork, shrimp and fried eggrolls..its fresh but still warm and it's not super heavy either..BOMB<//Text><gmap_id>0x80ea6a0250ca75eb:0xad786950c9ed86cb</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>(Translated by Google) Although it is a Vietnamese restaurant
The taste is not very authentic
Really a delicious Asian restaurant
There are also big sisters who can speak Chinese.
Feel very kind, very relaxed

雖然是越南餐廳
口味不是很道地
確實是一家很好吃的亞洲餐廳
裡面還有會講中文的大姐
覺得很親切 很放鬆<//review>< Pics>

<text>Yesterday I went to my storage it had been sometime since I was there, and
for the first time in all the years I have rented there the place was very well
manicured, clean, just made me feel good.  Mona immediately came out to
meet me to help me. A very hard working, friendly and professional  person.
I felt safer too because of the care on the place someone was taking care.</text>< time>

One time my husband left his phone on the back of his truck and it ended up in the road. The lady went the extra effort and got the cell phone back in my husband's hand. She even stayed over her time by a half hour or more to make sure we received the phone personally.
I recommend Waterloo Road Storage to everyone. Pay your rent on time and have no troubles.<//review>< pictures>

The office lady is a idiot. She took us to the wrong unit to begin with. I had to tell her that it was the wrong size because she didn't realize it. Then she made us wait while she went back to the office to get the correct number to a unit of the correct size. Then it wasn't even empty. This lady shouldn't be a manager in my opinion. So unorganized.<//review>

I really love this place a lot i also love dirandra she is awesome and does a great job she is always working and is always polite to her customers. The other lady is rude and is always in her room and never comes out when we have questions she is rude to you. She never wants to answer you nor does she want to help you. I only come in to deal with dirandra . Who ever the owner is really needs to recognize  who works and does not.</Text>

<Review>I have dealt with afew different storage facilities and i really like Waterloo Road Storage the best. The people are friendly and helpful. The grounds are kept clean. The managers drive by in their cart to check on everyone make sure your alright sometimes they ask if you need help. The storage units are nice, alot of sizes and very reasonably priced.< /Review>< username>

<Review>This storage facility has new owners and they are really doing a badddddd job at it. They close earlier now and gate access is now closed on holidays . We use to go there on holidays now we can't . Rent was due on the first and you had a 10 day grace period to pay or get a late fee. Well now it's still due on the 1st and if it's not paid on the first they lock you out now on the second day. If you are late getting out of the gate past 7  they charge $100.00 old owners charged $5. No smoking outside anymore. No big deal on that one. Too many changes all at once. People are not happy. Couldnt wait to find another storage place and leave that place. We now rent from  A&A mini storage in Lodi now. Wonderful place.Waterloo  not a well run place at all. We have been there a few years. Thus us the 3rd set of owners so far and the worst by far . They need a little customer service training.  Horrible place . That also has cocroaches in their units. So beware if you Want to rent here.<//Review>< response>

The small animal vet, Dr. Bear, is an amazing guy. He is so good with our cats, I feel completely at ease when we visit. We first met him when I called to inquire about getting our goat's feet trimmed and he came out to the house and did a remarkable job. We have been loyal customers ever since. A bonus is the clinic is in Blossom Valley it's always quiet and peaceful. The waiting area is outdoors, in the shade, great place to hang out. They also throw an annual Christmas party with food and live music for their customers!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>We saw Dr. Aaron Harlan for our three new goat babies for vaccines and castration.  We are new to owning goats as pets and Dr. Harlan was fantastic!  He was patient, very informative, answered every question we had, showed us what to look for in goats and how to trim their hooves.  So happy we have a local vet who understands livestock as pets!</text>< Pics>

We have been going to them for years and loved them.  But they've become so popular now that their old clients suffer for the sake of all the new people.  You have to book weeks in advance, so that pretty much limits it to strictly routine work - if you have a problem or an emergency, you're on your own.  No consideration for long-time patients whatsoever. That is no way to run a veterinary office.  I'm looking elsewhere.<//review>

These are by far the kindest people that you could ever take care of your pets. We took our cat Missy there for end of life care and the entire staff was so understanding and really cared about Missy.</Review>

I have used them in the past for my goat and they were great. This time i took my dog to be spayed. The price was great for how large and what was done. She was treated great and happy when picked up. Definitely would use them again.<//Review>

Dr. Manring did a great job the other day with my old pony, she pulled a tooth along with other maintenance, all while providing some excellent advice about the proper way to feed and care for him in his older years. So he can live the happiest most comfortable life. I like her proactive/preventative approach to equine health.</Text>

<Review>We used this place with Kasey and now with Ellie.
Much warmer environment than regular vet. Doesn't smell like a vet's office. They provide great service.
So glad we found this place in Blossom Valley.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>First time at ECLAP - fantastic experience. We left our old vet after the practice switched hands and we weren’t happy with the quality of service.

From the start- our vet tech was very professional and had a demeanor that made me feel like this practice had their act together. She took my pack into the office with confidence and control.

After their checkup, Dr. Christel came out to talk to me. Even though she is young, this veterinarian is extremely knowledgeable. She answered all of my questions in plain English.  I’m very happy with the service we got and I’ve found my new vet!< /Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>My first time at ECLAP.  . . I arrived an hour early for my appointment (my mistake), but they were very friendly and told me to wait.  I did not wait long until my dogs were taken back.  The vet met with me after their exams and went through each dog individually.  I had inquired about teeth cleaning for both dogs and was told only one needed it.  I appreciate them being honest and not performing services that are not necessary.  Overall, it was a good experience.  I had to wait several weeks to get my appointment.  I hope in the future that if they need to be seen for something more urgent that I am able to get in.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>This is our first visit to this Vet. I have a small dog and he did great. Thank you to Vet Rebecca and Kelly. Kelly was kind and made an effort to comfort Bear before his Exam and shots. Vet Rebecca answered all my questions and explained things I hadn’t thought of. She’s fantastic!  The cost of this visit was
less than I expected. Our previous Vet was so expensive compared to our new Vet. An example: Bear has appointment with our new Vet for his teeth next month and the old Vet estimate was double that amount. Check them out!</Review>< Gmap_id>

We've been bringing our pets for their 6-7 years now, & they now have no availability for right away needs like they used to, & referred us to El Cajon walk in place. I've referred people to go here & will no longer do so because of this. You should always leave open spaces for right away needs of your current patients or hire vet that is there for that specifically. Very disappointed now.< /text>

Explain everything before procedures, keep in touch during surgeries, and are very thorough with aftercare instructions. I have witnessed other patients arrive with an emergency and they were dealt with immediately and with compassion. The practice is very busy but appointment scheduling is reasonable. A+ on all fronts. I know are cat and dog are getting the best care possible. Thank you ECLAP!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//text>< Pics>

This was our first time to this veterinarian clinic. The Vet tech and doctor both came out to speak to me, even though I could not go in and both were very patient with my dog who was very excited and full energy. My dog has not run in over 2 weeks and he pulled on his leash but the vet tech was very patient and did not rush him. They were on time and thorough and the value of care for the price was exceptional. Bonus is the location is set on this beautiful ranch and farm and it feels like Dr Doolittle which seems how all vets should feel.< /review>

My dog had ACL surgery on her back leg in September and now needed her opposite leg ACL repaired. The only problem was my vet I found out is no longer practicing and taking my dog somewhere new to get surgery was really scary and stressful. After talking to a handful of friends I decided to try ECLAP and could not be happier with my experience! We’re on day 2 of her recovery and she has been eating, drinking and going to the bathroom like normal which was not the case last time at all. The entire staff is so friendly, helpful and their compassion and love for animals is very obvious. What more could you want as a pet owner?! I 100% recommend ECLAP!<//text>

<Text>With what I thought was our last good byes with our Little dog, and thinking we were going to have to put her down due to what appeared to be a tumor, Dr. Manring spent the time to evaluate and decided we would treat her rather than just putting her down and I’m glad. Our precious little dog is doing fine. What I thought was a tumor just turned out to be an infection and was diagnosed properly. Dr. Manring did not mess with our emotions (like many other Veternarian’s) yet calmed us by letting us know all of our options up front. Not once did she mention money during the evaluation like I had received at every other Veternarian that I have had to deal with in the past (other locations).

East County Large & Small Animal Practice Is very professional and caring. I will continue to use them for all of our animal care needs. I will recommend them to everyone...

Thank you Caitlin, you saved my dogs life!< /Text>< resp>

Very happy we decided to go to ECLAP for a second opinion for our dog. The staff and Doctor(s) were SO kind, their prices are INCREDIBLE, and the location is great. So clean and animal friendly, we felt right at home. We are definitely making ECLAP our new permanent vet office! It's about a 40 minutes travel for me, but WELLLLL worth it! :)</Review>

<Text>Caitlin was amazing. We left with my kids saying she could be one of the family. Caitlin took care of our badly injured baby alpaca in an emergency situation. We didn't know where else to go so from San Diego's North County to East County took over an hour but Caitlin took AMAZING  care of us and our baby. I will gladly go the hour to see her again!!!!

<Text>We have had a couple of our animals go here (pot belly pig and goat.) This past weekend a couple of our chickens were very sick and it was a Sunday.  We were able to make after hours call and spoke to vet.  We drove to El Cajon and pick up medications for the girls.  We would have lost them had it not been for ECLAP.  We are a few days into the medication and the girls are feeling much better and back to happy, healthy chickens.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

They are all amazing! I took my 2 year old Great Dane in to get fixed yesterday and they went above and beyond! Cleaned his ears, trimmed his nails, gave him all the love and cuddles and helped me wrangle Him into my car and took him on the side entrance bc he isn’t used to other dogs he doesn’t know. The best experience ever never ever taking my animals

You can tell there’s an effective system in place to handle the rush of appointments. Sure, if you’re here during their peak time, you might be waiting for a moment but the proof is in front of you with how hard they’re working! Each pet is greeted with a genuine smile. Their prices are fair and I never walk away feeling cheated. Props to this team! Thanks for being here for our furry family members :)< /review><rating>5< /rating>< response>

<Review>Best Vet ever.  I have been to too many vets and been over charged for services they scare you into because if you don't , you feel like a bad dog owner.  ECLAP is amazing.  They are conservative with what they suggest and they do an amazing job.  They are trust worthy and the letting is great and not scary for my dogs!<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Dr. Omar has been treating our horses for a while, I believe he even delivered out older horse. He is very caring with the horses. I also like that he explains everything thoroughly and answers all of our questions.
I would recommend Dr. Oman and anyone on the ECLAP team.< /text>< Pics>

Dr. Manring and the entire team at ECLAP have never let me down. Anytime I need an appointment, whether it is an emergency or a routine visit they are always available for me. Dr. Manring’s professionalism, knowledge and empathy that she expresses to her clients is second to none. She showed my family, myself, and my beloved horse Tanner so much love and dignity in his final hours. She also never hesitates to answer any of my million ridiculous questions or concerns about my little herd. Thank you Dr. Manring and everyone at ECLAP for all that you do for us!</text>

<Text>Dr. Harlan and his practice partners consistently provide effective veterinary care for my horses. They take the time to describe their care plan and rationale and have always been accurate in their diagnoses. I also very much appreciate Dr. Harlan's and his practice partners' calm, kind, and confident manner with my horses.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>We recently changed vets after adopting a new puppy and not feeling very satisfied with her puppy exam at our previous vet.  We very pleased with Dr. Christel and staff at ECLAP.  It was a completely different  experience compared to our previous vet.  Even with the restrictions in place due to COVID 19, we felt we received very personal and thorough service and our dogs were their priority while working with them.  I would highly recommend them!<//review>< username>

Dr Caitlin Manring is an excellent veterinarian and she is a kind, friendly person. She always answers my questions in a thoughtful, professional manner. My horses are in the best possible hands, and I greatly appreciate the compassion and responsiveness that we all receive from Dr Caitlin!  She is an asset to ECLAP's practice. CHEERS!<//Review>

She was wonderful with our Annie, kind and caring, and was so thorough with her.  She explained everything to me, and I decided then that she would be Annie’s new designated vet!!   And thankfully, Annie is going to be just fine! ♥️</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>East County Large Animal Practice is the best Veterinarian care in the Southwest. They took immediate care of our precious friend - helping her to be rid of a nasty growth that other Vets just shook their head at. We are very grateful to them. 5 real stars.

Dr. Harlan was fantastic! He ran late, but called before the appointment time with an updated time. Once here, he took all the time we needed to answer all of my questions. He was even proactive and answered some questions that I could come up because I am a new goat owner. His demeanor with the animals was calm and gentle. It was clear that he likes animals. He was also kind to my small kids. We are so incredibly happy to have found him!</Text>

ECLAP is the best medical service we have used for our horses  The entire team is very professional and efficient. But, the most important element they bring to the table is their kindness and compassion.  We have had a horse that is challenging to work with who also has serious arthritis and bouts of cellulitis. Throughout the journey they have been a guiding light of care.</text>

Dr. Harlan was wonderful with my pigs today-I was very happy with the service provided.  I was referred to you by someone who has worked with Dr. Harlan in the past and I was not disappointed.  Thank you so much :)< /Text>

< Review>
***Update*** I have changed my review to 5 stars. What a difference in experience from the last vet. Our last vet has had months and months of "fill in" vets after a health crisis. We have not had a very good experience there since. They also made clerical changes which was the straw that broke the camel's back. After talking with Dr. Crystal today, I feel so much better about my dog's care.
It's too soon to say yet as I don't know if they will be better than my previous vet. I have not heard back from them about all the tests they performed. I did call and leave a message for the vet that I saw and did not receive a call back. I do like the setup and the people there are incredibly nice. I didn't feel rushed and they seemed thorough. Slightly more expensive than my previous vet. I hope the higher price equals better care.<//Review>

<Review>I was referred to ECLAP when I first moved to East County in April '19. I'm so glad I was, I have nothing but amazing things to say about the entire team. Super nice & great customer service. I never feel as if they try to upsell me or overcharge me. They truly want to help you and your furry loved one. I'm so glad I have such an amazing vet for my fur kids!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Dr. Bear and all of the staff at East County Large and Small Animal Practice were wonderful! The vet tech even held and loved on Cutter while she was up on the table being examined so she would feel comfortable. They got back to me right away with lab results which was really nice, as waiting on results can be very nerve-racking. I am so happy to have found Dr. Bear and his team and look forward to visiting them with Cutter for many years to come. Thank you!</text>

My parents have used this practice for years for their horses, we had a bad accident with our lab and he needed amputation but we didn’t have a regular vet so I gave ECLAP a call. Their prices are great, as well as every staff member we encountered.  Seriously the best vet we’ve ever been too. Thanks to Dr Bear, Ashley and the vet assistant who helped with surgery, for taking great care of our boy Ranger.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Loved our experience at ECCLAP. Got right in to see a vet after requesting an appointment.  Dr.Bear was very helpful and made us feel very taken care of. Prices were VERY reasonable.  Checked out after an exam and medication and paid less than I did at my usual vet for just an exam. We will definitely be back!<//review>

I brought my 15+ yr old kitty with kidney disease in for bloodwork, it was done within 20 minutes and Dr Bear came out to review the findings with me and was so compassionate. The kind staff (including Ashley) even took the time to fix the covid haircut that I had given my kitty since her groomer is closed (they are much better at this than I am !)< /text>

We moved further away from our long time vet three years ago. I finally made the decision this week when our dog needed care to switch to ECLAP because they are so much closer in proximity to our house, and they came so highly recommended. Dr Oman was wonderful! We officially have a new vet. Super happy with the care our Nala received.<//Text>

< Review>
Wonderful experience! Dr, Christel was marvelous and I know that going ahead my kitty, Arrow, will be receiving the best of care. I was unaware that Arrow was in stage 2 kidney disease but Dr. Christel showed me the results of the blood work she did and we discussed what can be done to at least slow down the progression. He is also hyper-thyroid and I feel comfortable knowing he will be able to get his meds on a regular basis. I came to ECLSAP because the vet I was going to in Alpine (Alpine Veterinary Hospital) retired and I discovered it had been bought by the other vet in Alpine (County Veterinarian) where I had a horrid experience several years earlier. This Practice is only one freeway exit further down for me so still convenient enough. I love the country setting here and my kitty was treated gently and kindly by the rest of the staff. I'm so glad I found this Practice and highly recommend it.<//Review>

I recently adopted 2 goats/kids, I’ve only owned chickens, rabbit, dogs and cats . My 5 month old goat Wyatt- was struggling to urinate for a few days, I worried about stones.
After doing what most people do, I began reading everything I could on the internet, farmers home remedies and such. I was more afraid to cause my boy any harm. So I made the call.
My call was answered by Dr. Harlan, I explained his symptoms. And Dr. Harlan patiently listened and was so amazing because he took the time to explain all possibilities, options if it was indeed a blockage and his own past experiences. Even though they were booked, Dr. Harlan suggested I bring Wyatt in (They do home visits too) and he would see him between patients.
After a couple of hours, Dr. Harlan called me and    again took the time explained his findings, and allowed me to ask questions without making me feel rushed. We had a plan. He was honest, empathetic, and never recommended additional procedures or gave hidden false hope.  He gave me an estimated cost, which I was so fearful off( I need both kidneys- but would have sold one if needed) the price was doable.
Wyatt came home the same day in the evening and has been doing amazing. He’s on medications and I learned so much on proper feeding and care.
I will continue to use this amazing vet.  From Dr. Harlan (One of a team), the techs I spoke with  and the friendly staff at in the office. This is by far a 5-Star experience.

Thank you ECLAP/ Thank you Dr. Harlan and team from Wyatt and myself.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

In an unfamiliar time of isolation, I was warmly greeted in my somewhat emotional state over concern for my "pup", a very large doberman.  I felt "heard". Care was taken to address all of my questions.  Thank  you ECLAP staff.</Review>

I thought the two receptionists in the front office were unwelcoming for our first visit.  We were the only ones in the office and they couldn't pry their eyes off their computers to acknowledge me.  Even when one of them was asking me questions, it was while she was facing the computer.  I could not get my daughter's wheelchair through the door and, of course, they were oblivious to my plight.  I left my daughter outside of the office.  The receptionist then took us to a room and tried to weigh both my dogs.  She did not even try to talk to either of them.  The vet saw each dog for 10 min each, which is fine for a well check up.  She did not review the past records sent from our previous vet in front of me.  I'm giving  3 stars to be nice.  My previous vet always had a busy office and were still welcoming and nice.  This was actually my second visit.  I walked in one day to check out the office since I just moved to Blossom Valley.  It was empty again and I was greeted with a look of "why are you here."  I should have known then not to come back.  I think this office needs to sell itself a little better.</review>

ECLAP is the best! We are so fortunate that our neighbor told us about you. We couldn't be more satisfied with your care, concern and friendly service we experience with each visit.
Dr Oman is awesome! He saved our Vinny's toe when another vet wanted to remove it. And your staff is terrific!
We recommend your veterinary care every chance we get.
Thank you!< /review>

Dr Bear is EXCELLANT ! He knows my little dog,  Max and provides professional and friendly service. He makes taking Max to the vet easy.

This place is amazing! Seriously. I brought my litter of mini goldendoodles here for an exam and first shots.
To start, everyone that works here is SUPER friendly! The exam itself was above and beyond what other vets do for first exams with puppies.
At checkout they accept Apple Pay which is so convenient!
I live in Ocean Beach which is about a 45 minute drive from this vet but they will now be my primary vet! Going here is like a little mini vacay. It’s so spacious and on my visit they had some adorable alpacas!

Bottom line.. do yourself a favour and go here!<//Text>

I can’t say enough wonderful things about the whole team at ECLAP. They took care of our dog like she was a princess and they truly care. Brandi is so helpful and sweet and  Dr Dan is outstanding with all my animals. But the surgery he did on our last dog was a tough one but he took it on and did a perfect job. Thanks to him we  will have many more years with her. We will be Forever thankful for his kindness.

Even though our family got deviating news about our dog, I could never speak more highly about this place! The appointment was very quick and they broke the news to us in an extremely gentle way. The Dr was very sweet and I felt like she took care of my dog as she would her own.
I would like to think I'm a pretty tough woman but when we got the news that we only have a few short months left with my dog, I cried like a baby and the Dr comforted me like she was a long time friend. She gave me a huge and let me cry on her shoulder as long as I needed. She chatted with us about different treatment options and was very honest with us. This Dr made all the difference in the world. Thank you so much for your care and kind heart. It is more appreciated than you know.

Also, this vet came highly recommend by another vet and even though I live nearly an hour away, I will always take my animals here because the care was amazing. This is more than a vet, they treated us like family .<//Review>

We met and had Dr Manring do dentals and a small lump removal from my Jake’s lip.  She was awesome.  Being a new vet for me we talked about how I liked my horses interacted with.  Dr Manring was spot on!  And my normally suspicious older mare was comfortable with her.  Dentals went easy and no one was sore in their mouth.  And Jake’s lip is a thing of beauty!  5 stitches, no separation after 3 days, dry and you have to look close to see he had a dime sized lump removed!  I’m so pleased.  I definitely would recommend Dr Manring!< /text>

Dr Catlin Manring is an excellent vet. I was impressed with her knowledge regarding horses and pleasent demeanor. Her obvious love of horses shined through as she worked on my senior horse, talking to him, even though he was being a rather difficult paitent during a float.  She will be my first choice Vet for future care for him. I highly recommend her.</review>

My dog needed an injection for her allergies. All well and good, but the extra service and willingness to answer questions about food choices and how to keep my middle aged dog healthy and joints mobile, were very much appreciated. The information was thorough and made it easy to make a plan for my dog. I was very pleased.<//review>

I took my white labrador in for a neutering operation  and was extremely pleased with the customer service and the care they gave.  Definitely going to make this my vet clinic from here on out.  Very affordable as well.  We've tried a few others in the past but felt like they were just trying to upsell us on medications and services.  Highly recommend ECLAP!< /Review>

<review>What an amazing, skilled and organized staff. Like everyone else, my furry companion is more than a pet to me, he stood beside me on the battlefield. Military working dogs aren’t always the easiest clients to help, but they absolutely knocked it out of the park and kept me from going bankrupt at the same time, unlike other vets in the area who were easily 3x the price.

<Review>Dr. Harlan came out to address several issues I was having with my 28 year old horse. He was professional, knowledgeable, as well as personable. I would highly recommend Dr. Harlan to anyone needing a quality veterinarian for their horses. My experience with East County Large Animal Practice has been great and I will continue to use them for all of my horse’s care.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

We’ve been taking our 6 year old Doberman for veterinarian care since she was a puppy. We love everything about East County Large  and Small Animal Practice!  Although everyone is highly professional and well trained, they are all approachable, friendly, kind and clearly animal lovers.

Last week we  thought Willow had been gouged by her brother while playing at the beach. Over the weekend we noticed the wound had worsened and looked more like a bad spider bite. I called Monday morning at 8am and the receptionist said she’d get back to me to see if she could make some changes to fit us in.  It took an hour or so but she called back and got us in to see Dr Omen, who was great!

There have been some new members to the staff as one of the former owners retired recently.  Knowing this, I was a bit worried about getting in to see a vet quickly and even about getting a call back within a day.  Apparently things are running smoothly now as all was done beyond my expectation.

Gratefully, the prices for their services are completely reasonable.  For our appointment Monday, the ointment, antiseptic gauze, antibiotics,  and DrOmen’s and his assistant’s services were all inclusive in the cost.

I recommend East County Large and Small Animal Practice wholeheartedly!<//Text>

<Text>Dr. Ryan and the staff were wonderful to Sammy and loved the way we both were treated. Sammy, my dachshund has had skin and allergy issues all of his life ( rescue 🐶) and its been and will be a life long issue for him. Having a vet who listens and cares it important to me and essential to Sammy's well being.
I believe we're off to a great start! Very efficient service and beautiful surroundings love the openness of the facility. Thank you!</Text>< userid>

Doctor and staff were outstanding in their care of Maxine.  Their care met my highest expectations.  Glad the Army Veterinary office at Mirarmar recommended I go to you for the x-rays she needed.  Best of luck and continued success.

Dr. Harlan was great, this was my first "farm call" ever and he was very helpful and gave us all kinds of useful information, answered all my questions and was very thorough.  He even gave me the opportunity to see how to give my pig and injection behind the ear in case I would like to give it a try in the future.  Buddy, our 4H pig is doing much better today :)  Thanks Dr. Harlan you ROCK!!!< /Review>

<Review>The vet that came back was awesome! He was very gentle with my girl even though she wasn't cooperating. He was knowledgeable about her issue and took the time to discuss all the treatment option. Charlotte even got a hoof trim!

Years later and they are still the gold standard in veterinary care. Dr.Harlan came out to my house in the middle of the night to help us. Everyone we’ve come into contact with has just been great.<//Review>< Time>

I love ECLAP! I know they love and care so much for the animals they treat. Brandi and Alicia are always friendly and professional. The office is clean and Dr. Bear is so nice and knowledgeable. I really trust him. I have always been able to book a convenient appointment and their prices are very fair. I am so happy with the care my dogs have received here. They treat large and small animals, my Yorkie is only 7 lbs!< /text>

We love EVERYONE at ECLAP! We recommend  them EVERY chance we get, for small pets to large farm animals! They take such amazing care with our Family members! 🐾 It is getting much busier than iin years past. But, we're happy to have patience any time we go, since the busier it is, the more successful they are. 💞 Sorry I added too, much sugar to the cheesecakes! 😂< /text>

I took my pet pig to be spayed. My experience was wonderful from reception to pick up. Each person I met was very caring and cordial. Dr Oman gave me a, brief but complete, tour of the facility. I left there feeling like I had just met James Harriott. "All Creatures Great and Small". I highly recommend ECLAP.</text>

<text>Thank you Dr. Bear and staff for being so nice to my big boy, Buckaroo,(Bucky). Everyone was so friendly and efficient.  I appreciate the professionalism and care Bucky received and the very thorough exam.  I needed expert advice concerning the various physical problems that Bucky has been experiencing and felt comfortable with Dr. Bear's opinion for future care.  We will most certainly be returning and I will recommend ECLAP to anyone needed veterinary care.  Sincerely, Bette Crowther<//text>< Gmap_id>

The staff was great but I took my pet sheep in to get fixed and I had a difficult time getting basic care. Things like how old it was, what condition it was in, reminding to give shots. If I take the time to drive my critter down there the least I expect is a basic health check . Was only given after care instructions after I called them once home. Also no one has called to see how my animal was doing and if I had any questions</text>

Dr. Johnson examined Heart and said I was doing everything that I should do for his upper respiratory infection. I thought I had overreacted in bringing him and we really didn't do any treatment. Heart passed away in the night. I wish we would have been Proactive and done more.  I spent $100 and really didn't get any result. I should have been more persistent in getting him some IV fluids and maybe different meds. Live and learn.

As always, the staff and vets here are amazing. You can just tell how much they care about your animals. I have 4 dogs, so I am here a lot and I have always been able to see a doctor within a day and same day if urgent. Added bonus, you never know if you'll get to see a horse, pig, sheep or goat there!< /Text>

<Response>None</Response><Review>Good Morning! This was a write up from our last visit! Want to reiterate how amazing Dr. Bear is! Below will be about our visit yesterday! Dr. Bear was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!!! I brought my little black Pug in named Ernie and from the moment I arrived to the moment we left it was an absolutely wonderful experience. I called the previous day to make an appointment before hours and the gal on the phone wound up talking to me for like 15 minutes and before we hung up wished my little guy a speedy recovery and hoped that he would be feeling better soon. I hung up the phone and had to tell my husband just how nice even the receptionist was. Dr. Bear took his time with Ernie, did a very thorough exam, then gave me his diagnosis and recommendations. I felt as though he treated my baby as though Ernie was his own. No denying not only does Dr. Bear and staff love animals, but have a love for people. Top notch experience!
Yesterday our little guy Ernie, has his teeth cleaned, and Dr. Bear was again AMAZING and compassionate. He knew how much our little guy means to us! Called immediately after to let us know he was all done and doing well! We can’t say enough! Thank you Dr. Bear! ❤️🐾<//Review><Date>1573835250661</Date><user_name>Jill Power-Kruger</user_name>< userid>

We loved working with ECLAP! Doctor Harlan was great with our very energetic two-year old mare and the office staff was amazing and easy to work with as well. We called 10 minutes before our appointment to change our plans and they were happy to accommodate. I would definitely trust them with any of my horses and would recommend them to anyone.</Text>

I have been twice to ECLAP clinic and tho it was an hour drive from my home in Escondido, it was well worth the trip.  The first visit was to have several of my dog's teeth pulled.   The last visit was to  have a doctor look her over and check a lump in her side that is slowly growing.  X-rays were taken and it was determined it was not encroaching on any vital organs, or hurting her in any way.  It  is not something that shows under her coat, and we are just going to watch it in the future.  I was very pleased with both the thorough exam and explanation given by the vet.  In getting estimates from two vets I found that ECLAP is much more reasonable.Thank you<//text>

Needed to get both my golden retrievers a rabies booster. We were in and out within 10 minutes, and that was without having to make an appointment first (they had received an exam within the last 12 months). Very reasonable charge for the boosters, too. Thanks, ECLAP!</Review>

I’m so glad I switched to this vet .. hands down I felt like the listened and heard my concerns.  I felt like my pets health was first.  I switched to this vet after several years of using another and feeling like they were never listening to me. Listening is key in life!!! These people heard And delivered above and beyond my expectations.   Thank you 😊< /review>

<text>LOVE this practice so much.   Even my dog loves coming here and loves the staff. My dog Sproles is usually standoff-ish to new people, but was so good when I brought her here the first time.   I'm so thankful to have found you guys for my dog's treatment needs. I recommend everyone to come here.< /text>< time>

I absolutely love ECLAP ! Everyone there is so kind, loving and down to earth. The girls in the office are always so funny and nice. Dr. Ryan Bear is the best, he’s so honest. I’ve been to other vets where you go in for a skin rash and walk out with a quote for over a thousand dollars. Not here at ECLAP! They always save me money. I’m just so grateful for them. ❤️< /review>

<Review>ECLAP personnel did a wonderful job with my small terrier-mix, Toby. Toby usually scared at the vet. He is a rescue dog and has obviously had bad experiences prior to our adopting him. The vet at ECLAP was gentle and understanding of Toby's "personality problems". They determined where and what his problem was and offered several options for treatment. Overall, a very good visit to the vet...even if Toby didn't think so. Thanks...Jim Brown< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>We started using ECLAP about 30 years ago and have  gotten outstanding service and care from all the Vets that work there.  They are all extremely knowledgeable and if they don't know something, they aren't afraid to ask their associate for an opinion or suggestion.  Dr. Smith is especially good with older horses and shows compassion for both them and their owners.   It has also been great having a small animal office available.  Kind of like "one stop shopping."   Love their yearly Christmas party!!!    Great way to show they appreciate loyalty.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>I had an emergency with a horse I lease and the owner's vet was not available so I called ECLAP, the vet practice I use for the horse I own. Dr. Harlan was there in less than 45 minutes. He laid out a clear plan for the horse's care and offered reassurance that, although there was a ways to go yet, he felt the horse could get better. I had been afraid we would be putting him down that day but Dr. Harlan got us over the hump. I love ECLAP.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Going to a new Vet can always be stressful but everyone at ECLAP made us feel at home from the first phone call to check out.   Both my cats were at ease and comfortable with everyone.   My stubborn male cat, Flynn, even purred while there which he rarely does.  Loved the service and will be coming back as needed.  Thank you ECLAP< /Review>

I can't tell you how grateful we are for your accommodating services!  We had no appointment but they got us in!  All staff helped us get our injured dog out of the car & into exam room he is 94 lbs!  The doctor & his assistants were so wonderful and took care of our big boy!  He is healing at home now!  Thank you all so much!!!

<review>I want to thank Dr. Harlan for coming out to take care of Ellie Mae's hooves. Unfortunately the past farriers I had out, we had bad experiences.

Dr. Harlan was so gentle and took his time and did an amazing job, I am so pleased!!  I want to say I have received nothing but the best care from ECLAP.  Each and everyone of your staff have always been so helpful and professional, I can't thank you enough!

I am so thankful I have found ECLAP, I will continue to recommend you to my family and friends.

Thank you again,

Both Dr's Smith and Chandler are always available by phone to answer any questions I have about his feed and changes I can do to improve his nutrition. They are gentle and kind to my old guy when they check his teeth and do not float them unless they really  need them. They use a lower dose of sedative because of his age which means they have to put up with some of his shenanigans. I have been with them for 30 years and highly recommend them. I am very comfortable leaving the care of my dear friend to them.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Exceptional!  Took our dog in for a dental procedure based on recommendation from a friend.  Our (former) vet was going to charge over $1000 and the team at ECLAP did it for under $400.
Dr. Bear did a great job with Duke and called me personally after he was done. He answered all my questions and was the most personable and approachable vet I have ever experienced.  I wish we weren't getting sent to Okinawa so Duke could keep going here.
Cannot recommend the entire team at ECLAP enough!<//review><GmapID>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730< /GmapID>< Name>

<Text>I did some research and found this place on google
I was pretty impressed with their reviews , so I made an appointment for my 3  1/2 month old Mini  pig for his nurturing ! At first I was pretty upset because I had dropped him off at 8 am and was told that I was going to get a call as soon as he was out of surgery, So it was around 1:30 and I hadn’t heard from them so I called and at first they told me that he was all done and then the receptionist put  me on hold and said that he did not have his surgery yet the doctor had a emergency,which I understand there are emergency , things come up! but there could have been just a little better communication on their part.   So then I was told to pick him up at 4:30 , I had about a 45 minute drive , I waited until 4 pm. still no call
so I started to wonder what was going on ,I drove up and he was just getting done , So I waited out on the patio and shortly after the doctor came up and gave me an update, then went to check on my pig
I really liked that the doctor took the time to come out and explain everything to me and had the time for any questions or concerns! At that point I was more relaxed!  He also made sure that before I left that he explained the recovery and healing process again and made sure that I didn’t have any more questions! So overall I give the facility a four stars but the doctor did an amazing job on my Pepper he definitely gets a five ⭐️ star rating !  I recommend Dr.Harlan ,he was absolutely professional,friendly and caring for my pig</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I am very gapph with the responsiveness and attention bgiving to my mare when she was colicing.  Dr. Johnson made every attempt to ensure we knew exactly what was going on, very detailed for me in her notes of aftercare and follow up.  I highly appreciated the 24-hour call center as this has been a huge help for me.  I could not of been any happier.  Thank you Dr. Johnson, you made all the difference Sunday morning.<//Review>

Love ECLAP. They have done two pre purchase exams for me, two years apart. Always excellent service, sound clear advice and very efficient administrative work (Brandi). I was sad to hear Dr. Smith retiree, but Dr. Johnson was equally impressive!< /text>

ECLAP was a very pleasant first time experience. The staff was friendly and there wasn’t a long wait and most of all they spent time with my dog and treating her good and answering questions for me.< /text>

<Review>We were more than impressed with ECLAP! They took such good care of our Sophie Loren (8 month old Goldendoodle) for her Spading surgery yesterday. They are definitely there for the right reasons. Their cost was close to $500 less than what our current vet quoted us. We are 100% moving Sophie’s care to ECLAP! Thank you.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I would never recommend these people to anyone. I brought my ten-year-old cat in to get her teeth removed and ever since then she's acted like I beat her and she runs away and hides underneath the bed 24 hours a day I told these people to take extra care of my cat and ever since she's not the same cat anymore and she's traumatized by The Experience she's had with these people. Not only that but after the surgery her face swell up so badly that the next day she had pus coming out of her mouth and her whole face was just so swollen that I had to take her somewhere else to get her help. I don't even think they gave her a pain killer when they were doing the surgery , she will never be the same cat again. They didn't even give her an antibiotic shot after the surgery so I think they wanted her to get infected so I would bring her back to them to fix her. I would not trust these people with your cat.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Always a great experience with great people.
We lost our Oldest Rescue on the 2th of last month and then on the 30th our Smallest and Second Oldest Rescue had a major Seizure.
The wonderful people at ECLAP saw him quickly and after some checking, reassured us he was doing okay.
Can't say enough good things about them all.<//Review>

I really feel at home at ECLAP, They take care of my Pigs,Goats,Cattle,Sheep,Dogs,Cats.Dr Oman has gone over and above with the health care of our farm, The office staff takes such good care of all of us, human and fur babies too!!They are always so friendly, always has time to stop and chat ,even if they are right in the middle of something! I so appreciate all the knowledge they all have to take such good care of all of the farm!! And I have NEVER felt unfairly charged for the services we have received.

ECLAP has some of the best vets I have had.  When I call in with a question, either the office will ask a vet in  the office or you can leave a message.  They will return your call with the information you are looking for.  They are caring and knowledgeable and if one does not know the answer, they will use their resources to find out.  I would and do recommend ECLAP to anyone who is looking for a great vet.</Text>

< Review>
Superlatives!  I couldn't make up my mind whether to have a ranch call or an office visit, and the office staff was extremely patient with me.  We no lo have large animals, but I didn't want to haul three cats and a dog into the local vet's office, even though it is just down the street. I would have to pay for four office visits, and to take the dog and the cats together to the ECLAP small animal office was not really not possible---so we paid for an old fashioned ranch call and Dr. Smith accommodated us like he always does.  Dr. Smith is a caring, down to earth guy and always takes the practical approach. We have been with ECLAP for about 25 years and we have never had any bad issues with them.  Highly supportive as well as understanding and ranch practical.<//Review>

<Review>I have a 12 1/2 yr old dog who is my dearest friend.  He is a large pit mix and the sweetest animal.  He is my constant companion, he goes everywhere with me.  In the last 6 months he is really slowing down and gettting up and down have been hard on his back end.  He has had is right knee operated on and 3 cancer surgeries in his hind quarters which is why the drastic slowing down.  Dr. Oman has been helping me find solutions on how to make more comfortable.  We have tried a few different things and now just got done with a series of 8 laser treatments on him.  It is like having my old dog back.  He stopped following me around, now he is doing that again!  He wants to run and play when we are outside.  He can jump up on our bed again.  We know he is an older dog, but if you saw him, you would swear he was no older than 5 or 6.  Thank you Dr. Oman, thank you for giving my dog a less painless life.  Thank you for taking the time with me, the crazy dog owner.  Kathy who has done all the laser treatments is wonderful.  I have sent other dog owener in, and they all have nothing but good things to say.  My family has used them for years, now luckily we are too.  Thank you Thank you Thank you!!<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< pics>

I'm a relatively new horse owner.   Dr. Chandler and his staff have been great - they are on time, competitively priced, wonderful with my Arabian, and provide me with the information I need to be a better owner.   I can always rely on ECLAP!</Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<review>I think the word "CARE" is the most appropriate when describing what ECLAP is all about. They care about the animals, they care about the owners, and the excellent care they provide is way beyond the normal. Communication is another aspect where they excel. The office staff is patient and works with us in so many ways. When I call on ECLAP I know I am providing the best medical care for animals. The medical staff explains in terms we can understand exactly what is happening and our choices. They provide us with information and explanations, they tolerate the over reactions, they have compassion for our worry or sadness, they supply humor when it helps, understanding when needed and support whenever required. I think we in San Diego are so fortunate to have the very best which is ECLAP.< /review>< Rate>

<Review>I have been using ECLAP for 20 plus years for my beloved horses. When they expanded to small animals we began taking our dogs there. The Vets and office staff is unsurpassed. They take time to explain treatments and options on each visit. They never pressure you on decisions that must be made but if asked is always willing to give you their opinion. They do not hesitate to call in specialists when needed. I am on the board of the local horse show club, Tumbleweed Riding Club. ECLAP has been very generous and a big supporter of our group. ECLAP is a huge asset to the community and to each animal owner.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

My experience with ECLAP was the same as it always is.  Everyone is so nice, so accomodating and so wonderful with my dog.  I have lived in East County my entire life and have always had lots of pets.  I have been to at least 10 other practices in my lifetime and ECLAP beats them all for price, expertise and customer service.  I would never go anywhere else!</review>

We are so glad that we found out about Eclap! The staff were all very friendly, and Dr. Bear was great. We got in and out for our puppy appt in 30 mins, with all of our concerns addressed, and it didn't cost us a fortune as it would've elsewhere.<//Text>

I have been with ECLAP since 1999 - they are fantastic. Response is quick and courteous. They care for my horses and dog almost as much as I do. They listen to what I have to say and work with me. They have helped me pull my horse KitKat through Laminitis  and were there to help me with the passing of my horse Magic and my dog Athena. They are the best vets I have found and would never change.
Thanks so much ECLAP!!</Review>

After being a client for nearly 10 years, I just can't say enough good things about Dr. Smith and the staff at ECLAP. They're friendly, extremely knowledgable, provide excellent care and education, and don't charge an arm and a leg. Routine appointments at my home have always been convenient for me, which I really appreciate because we live in the boonies and logistics can be tricky. When my horses have needed emergency care, the response has always been prompt. From basic care to teeth floating to reproductive services to colic, ECLAP is ALWAYS MY FIRST CHOICE!<//Text>

< review>
Dr Ryan is the Bomb he Rocks I love this place.  I rescue and have 7 dogs of my own as well.  I have been going to a bigger practice and more and more feeling like they just do not care .  I heard about eclap and decided to give them a try.  I am ever glad I did.  These people are what vets should be.     I am not always an easy client to deal with but Dr Ryan took the time answered all my questions.  He is calm cool collected exactly what you want for you babies.
Dr Ryan Opps I think it is Dr Bear LOL will be seeing my animals from now on.  Lucky guy stuck with me now.
I had trust issues with my last vet office but not at this vet they will be honest and when you meet Dr Ryan you will see .  For me it only took 1 visit to realize  this was the vet for me.   I put off a dental for my dog for 2 years because my last vet I just did not trust that they cared about my dog.  At the vet I was going to seemed like my animals  were just  $100 bills with tails.  I don't care about the cost but I wanted the vet to actually care about my dog and that is what you get at ECLAP people that care.

Cathy the Vet tech who assists Dr Ryan is abslutly precious, she treats your pet as if it were her own.  There are no words to say how wonderful she is, but know this I appeciated how my dog was cared for by Dr Ryan and Cathy.    I cannot believe how lucky I am to have found them. In the middle of the dental one of the nice tech/receptions came and told me all was going well.  That meant so much to me to know my Dog was Ok and doing well.  They all knew how nervous I was and everyone of them did what they could to make me feel more relaxed.
As much as I would like to keep this place all to myself, if you are unhappy with your current vet you may want to try ECLAP.
warning there is no fancy exam rooms or fluff but your pet could care less, the care is beyond wonderful at ECLAP the fancy fluff  you get at other places means nothing if your beloved pet is just a number.
ECLAP Dr Bear Cathy and Staff Wonderfu people don't ever change
thanks ECLAP
will be making appointment for my other guys<//review>

<Text>Dr. Christel, was very professional, and handled our horses very well. She floated their teeth, and all are Doing very well. She answered all of our questions, and if she was unsure, she went and talked to other vets, which is a plus, in my books.
Thank you, Dr. Christel<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>
