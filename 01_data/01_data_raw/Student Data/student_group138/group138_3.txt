I have been in business with Benutech for a couple of years. It has been very helpful for my business. They have excellent customer service. Michael Paul, the Customer Service Supervisor goes above and beyond to make sure our needs are taken care of. I highly recommend their services and business.</Review>

<review>Benutech is hands-down the best real estate product out. I particularly look for how products will leverage my business, ease of use, return on investments and premium client relations and Benutech does just that. I am able to analyze data and target specific lead types which in turn reduces my marketing cost. I am able to service my own clients better w the farms I can build and analyze within the system. In addition to the system being easy to use for data analysis and marketing, their customer service is top notch. Michael Paul is my point of contact who is always so helpful. He goes above and beyond to assist me w my needs. Benutech has all the attributes I need to make me a loyal and lifetime client.<//review><response>None< /response>< time>

Michael Paul is absolutely the best person I’ve spoken to on the opposite end of a phone for any customer relations questions I’ve ever had in any field. He goes above and beyond not only to solve the issue but to assist and comfort amid confusion. He’s an amazing person! So grateful for his help.</text>

Working with Benutech has been a wonderful experience, They provide excellent leads for my real estate company on a monthly bases i am signed up to their ReboGateway service. What i value most about any company besides the tools, is their customer service. Micheal Paul has taking care of me since the first day i signed up for the service, and has continuously held that same standard in making sure i got the best out of the program.

Thank you to the Benutech team.<//Text>

I have worked with Michael Paul for years. He is patient and informative and has helped me so much. His professionalism and concern for my success is worth every training session. More trainers should treat their customers with the kindness and customer service Michael provides. Don’t know what I’d do without him!</text>

The Rebogateway software is top notch. So much quality and up to date information. There was a slight learning curve though, so if you have any questions just ask for Michael when you call in and he will walk you through everything step by step. Great experience overall<//text>

They have an invaluable technology and a great team.
I have had the pleasure of working with one of their reps, Mr. Michael Paul, on several occasions within the past couple of months.
He is a true professional who is equipped with both the knowledge and the personality that are needed to provide a world class customer service experience.

Michael’s super quick response to answering or returning a call is exactly what you need when you’re out in the field, in front of customers.

I have been working with Benutech for a few years now. I know that I personally didn't have my setting within the Rebogateway platform setup to it fullest extent. As, I was working as usual one day, I received a phone call from representative Michael Paul asking to see if there was anything he could help me with. He took a look at my settings and confirmed that it wasn't configured at it's fullest potential. He took it upon himself to make the valuable changes that it needed. I appreciated his help tremendously. Thank you!</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Benutech has the best customer service on planet earth without question! I was driving my car in NYC years ago and on the bumper of the car directly in front of me was a sticker and it said "It's not the sell but the service that counts". Wow! One of their best qualities is they are not money hungry. They are actually concerned about your needs first and that is how they won me. Ed and I spoke for about three weeks before I spent any money and that's just unreal in sales. Since I joined the Benutech family, I've been inspired by many people there and I loved every second of it. Thanks Benutech for being concerned about my growth and very patient with me!<//Text></record>

I have been using Title Toolbox for the last year. As a title rep, we are given tons of farming programs to help realtors grow business and make their work easier. I use title toolbox for every farm because of the detail I am able to pull. Their customer service is always on top of it when I have a problem and will reach out to me within 30 minutes of me putting a request in! If you are not using title toolbox then you are missing out. Awesome program!</Text>

I just signed up for Rebogateway and needed to inquire about the settings when John answered the phone.  He was very knowledgeable in helping me and got me through the process of the entire site in record time.  I like the fact that he was able to give me examples of each step in the process which made me ready to do business in every category in less than 30 minutes.  John is a good example that true customer service really works!  He actually answered the phone on the first ring!  Thank you John...you are now my go to person for any future needs!< /text>

Worst lead service I've ever used. They promised a number of different lead types that they never provided, probate, divorce, bankruptcies, etc. I constantly called asking about it and they promised me they were working on it but never followed through. Here's the best part, one year later they charged my credit card again without my consent. Then they refuse to refund it. They are dishonest and unethical.</Text>

<text>Fun place to go! I went before a holiday party to treat myself. The only thing is I wish they used a bitttttt less product because I felt like my hair was weighed down a lot. It seemed like they weren’t really sure what to use given specific hair types and more had general heavy hairspray! I’m sure service varies person to person though and I’d definitely return with some girl friends!</text>< pics>

Absolutely amazing service! I came in at 7AM to get my hair done for my newborn photo shoot for my baby girl. I had to bring her with me since she was only 9 days old and I could not leave her yet. They were so kind and helped me keep her in a quiet place. I felt so relaxed and beautiful when I left here, even with a 9 day old baby and on the way to a photo shoot. ;)<//Text>

I have never ever had them be punctual. Very limited respect for people's time. Stylists are great but 3 stars because of every time you wait so long<//Text>

I have been coming here since it opened several years ago.  The place was fabulous. The staff is great.  They are professional and kind.  I have had one bad experience in the years I have been coming here, I simply asked for a different stylist in the middle of my blowout.  No questions asked, my hair was finished to perfection.< /text>

Staff is pretentious and unprofessional.  Quality of blowout compared with other locations is low for those with ethnic curly hair.  Save your money not a great experience.</Text>

I went at 7am and had a great experience at this location. It's the standard Drybar experience you'd expect anywhere, but with a ton of parking given its location.< /text>

At every other drybar my girlfriend goes to, her hair comes out looking great. The stylists at this location must not be very competent because her hair comes out looking worse than when she comes in. Also, they don't put out cookies.< /Text>

<Review>Not very happy with their service. I had cash only on me, no credit card. Nowhere does it state that cash is not an accepted payment method and it sucked that I had to call my husband for the number so they could punch it in although I had plenty of cash. Really unfriendly and snippy person at the front desk. The hair-do was okay, not worth the money though. Will not come here again.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1526301784593, 'text': "Hi Beate,\nThank you so much for responding with this feedback!

Treated myself to my first drybar experience on NYE, i scheduled an "uptini" and left a note that i had long thick hair. The stylist looked irritated the whole time and eventually swaped me out to another stylist halfway through because the type of style i wanted "wasnt her strength" (wish she'd mentioned that when i showed her 4 different styles as options). It felt rushed from the beginning, definitely not a pampering or lux experience, and there were slight mentions of work grievances between staff. I walked out with a part which i didnt want and flat hair, not like the picture i gave at all. I spent 90$ for an average updo i couldnt wait to take out. Just get a blow out (even those looked average).< /text>

< Review>
I had a very bad experience at this salon. I asked the stylist to be gentle while styling my thinning hair but she was rough and the experience was somewhat painful (literally) and I lost quite a few hairs. In fact, some of my hair got caught in the hairdryer and my scalp is still sore 7 hours later! Furthermore, the stylist didn't put any heat protectant in my hair. The salon felt like it was over 80 degrees and rather than turning on the air conditioning, they opted to leave the front door wide open on a warm afternoon. The counters were messy so had the appearance of poor management and disorganization. Because I was quite unhappy with the experience, I had decided not to tip the stylist, so I payed with exact change. However, the blue-haired receptionist questioned why I wasn't leaving a tip for the stylist so rather than have a scene, I caved in. I will never be back to this salon or any other "drybar" establishment.</Review>

Probably the worst blow out experience I've ever had. I could've done a better job myself. Used way too much heat and brushing. Didn't do the style that I asked for at all. Overpriced.< /text>

<Text>The staff here is very sweet and helpful, seriously customer service is amazing! Jessica helped me out today and she was there every step of the way with any questions I had, she seriously went above and beyond. From selecting my perfect lace garter, to the perfect matching stockings, sex toys and a few fun Bachelorette style games for a party I have coming up. She took her time with me and went through different "toys" with me until I found the right one. Very knowledgeable and attentive. I will definitely be back soon, so glad I found this place and it being close to home is a plus! Thank you ladies !!!!</Text>< time>

(Translated by Google) In this place they don't peel you or take care of you if they know you're not going to buy anything, and it sells you up to what you don't occupy, if they have beautiful baby dolls, and enough worthwhile toys

(Original)
En este lugar no te pelan ni te atienden si saben que no vas a comprar nada, ay te vende asta lo que no ocupas, si tienen bonitos baby dolls, y bastantes juguetes que valen la pena< /Text>

I have been coming here for several years to smog my cars. I drive quite a bit out of my way to come here mostly because I appreciate their no games pricing. When you go to smog your car almost every place you go wants to play games with the pricing and coupons that don't make any sense. This place the price is laid out, straight forward, no surprises. Make an appointment, Pay cash, support a local business. Thank you and You're welcome.<//Text>

<review>My catalytic converter was stolen and they did the repair and added a large metal security plate to the bottom of my car. Well some thieves came back a month or so later and stole the cats from 3 other Prius in my complex! But they didn't take mine. Thank you for the repair!!</review>< rate>

<text>Brought in a sports car I bought out of state. The smog person pointed out some "illegal" parts that were on the engine.  I explained I bought it that way but he let me know unfortunately they are not valid in California.  He even showed me the company website for the performance parts stating they are not legal for California.  The girl at the front desk was helpful and let me know there was no charge since the smog man had caught the illegal parts before hooking it up to the machine.  I appreciate them not wasting my time or money.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Jake owns the shop located right in the heart of Ptown. He is honest and fair, I repeat, he is a mechanic that is honest! He specializes in many vehicles, but services our family BMW better than anyone. I will always bring my cars here thanks to the shop's high level of customer service and expertise.
Thank you PTown Smog & Repair!< /Review></record>

They do a fantastic job and always can rest easy. They are very trustworthy which is a breath of fresh air. I will drive 50 mins just to get my car to them. Love them!!!<//review>< Pics>

Fast and professional, cheapest smog checks in the tri-valley with the coupon. Just make sure you get there before 3pm because they get busy in the afternoons.<//review>

This is the best repair shop in town. The staff is very professional, service is fast. But most importantly, they are honest. Unfortunately for me it was not the first place i went and that's why i ended up spending lots of money for nothing. It's very hard to find a car mechanic who you can trust. If you don't yet have one, this is the place to go! Thumbs up for this place.</Review>

<Text>Says they will take customers till 4:30 pm and drove over there and said no. You shouldn't say you will take customers till 4:30 pm when you know that you can't. Cheap smog but terrible customer service.</Text>< Time>

<Text>The Absolute Worse! Stay away from this repair shop if you value your vehicle, seriously! They can not be trusted. I took my car in for a simple smog test. I waited in the lobby and during the smog test they damaged the hood (interior) and wheel well. There is clear evidence that the mechanic was not paying attention to what he was doing and disregarded the safety of my vehicle as he left some equipment in the engine compartment and slammed the hood down. Thus damaging the entire surrounding area. THE WORST PART is that the employees did not tell me about what happened or the damaged they caused. Instead they sent me home as if they did not do anything wrong and pretended like everything was in the original condition. This particular car of mine is a vehicle that (was) in prefect like new condition with barely 10k miles. Rarely driven, mostly for special occasions to car events and shows. To my dismay and horror I opened up the hood today Sunday Dec 16 2018 and discovered all the damage this shop caused to the interior engine compartment of my car.

I would like the business owner to respond back to me and say why this shop thinks its ok to behave in this manor and fail to inform their customers of any damage the shop causes plus not take full responsibility for correcting something like this. There is no question that the mechanic knew about the damage he caused because you can't miss it.

I usually don't raise an issue over minor things but this a MAJOR so I had to come here and WARN potential customers to STAY WAY FROM THIS SHOP.

I will look for a response from management and hope take an honest approach to fixing the damage they caused. I placed my trust in them and they betrayed me in every possible way. This is very upsetting to say the least.

No customer should never be subjected to a terrible experience like this from any business in the community.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1563552613285, 'text': 'Bureau of Automotive Repair investigated your claim and found no violations on our part.

I had just replaced all the hoses and belts w/a reputable company that I know personally...They came back after the test with a picture of a hose cracked...Told me that I have to pay & wait again...They told me a price for the hose, then I get there the hose was more & they up it for install that was not disclosed for said hose that you can see from opening the hood...Not trusting of them so far...We will see...If it does not pass...I will pass on them...I was next and then the Tech had someone roll up in a Maserati trying to cut the line...Never again...NOT RECOMMENDED...Wow...Will be on the no pass go list and wish they would allow for 0 stars or negative stars...Cheapest is not always best...Again NOT RECOMMENDED<//text>

<text>$20 total for smog check including electronic certification to DMV. I think it's cash only, but not certain. BTW, I did NOT need a coupon.

First come, first served. Took About 20m for the test as promised.

I have a 2011 4 door sedan. Apparently prices are set by type of vehicle.

You cannot beat the price, I checked about 5 different places in Pleasanton.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fe9a404ea2355:0x8628a3a0ae4adb72<//gmapID></record>

<text>tried there once when I bought my car for a smoke check and oil change, I went there without an appointment but they can arrange me quickly in line, all jobs were done pretty well and definitely I will be there again for my next service, btw, except oil change or smoke check, their professional car repair/diagnose may be worth trying too.</text>< name>

Pros: Polite service and staff. Good SMOG services. First come first serve.

Cons: Charged ~$1200 for brake parts that have a street price of ~$500. They forgot to service OBD, nor did a shakedown run, leading to a $400 oil leak.

Before having work done I suggest fact-checking their quote for parts prices. Afterwards, I had to have another shop double check their work and fix the oil leak!< /review>

Their queuing system is bad. You don't know when your car will be smogged among the other plenty cars. But they are fast, efficient and cheap with coupons. Give them a try and make sure you know how many cars are ahead. Though I asked and was told 6, but I was the last one to get smogged. Too bad.< /text>

As advertised, went to the store to get the smog check last Saturday after Lunch, shop was closed and no sign that they are out for long weekend, few other customers also they even said that had called the place and no one answer the phones.

I am sure we got there on wrong day.. will try again in couple of years<//review>

I have a PO box service here, Once I lost the key , they helped me so quick , hassle free in a friendly manner for the replacement of duplicate key. They always helped me for the choosing best and cheap Postal services through out the America and globally. Keep it up. God bless you guys.</text>

Karen in the front desk she discriminates  against certain people every time she would not help me I have to wait for someone else even other employees agreed with me on why she won’t help me and I realize she does it with other people as well,  I had already complain but usps seems  not to take care of this matter I will not stop until Someone lessens to me and I will escalate this situation which is very uncomfortable for me .and if you guys required proof I can Show video Of her doing this things. But I also have to credit the rest of the staff are very nice, helpful, and give great costumer service.<//Text>

This is a wonderful small post office in Van Nuys. The clerks are friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. There is seldom a line.
I recommend highly recommend it.<//review>

I call right after they open and somehow all of the representatives are already on the phone and won't be free for over an hour?? I don't buy that, they just don't want to have to do work right away.<//text>

< Review>
I drop off my rent check here because the landlords PO Box is located there, on two occasions it has taken over a WEEK to get to her box and I've had to pay a late rent fee and it just makes me look irresponsible! They also never ever answer thier phones. Waiting to hear about my status on a package that they "couldnt deliver"so we'll see.. this place just needs better management/more employes that care.< /Review>

Its nearly 11:am and the lobby with the P.O.Boxes is closed. Its supposed to be open regardless of the holiday. I drove here for nothing and Im going home empty handed.
The girl responsible for opening the doors is probably taking the day off. Extremely disappointed.</text>

I've been calling for 2 hours. Nobody answers this number. So frustrating! They say they delivered my package in my mailbox. I don't have a mailbox or my package or any way to talk to anybody regarding this.WTH!</review>

<text>These guys deserve 10 stars, or at least Mike does. Mike was our driver.  His response time was awesome for our remote location. He knew the area, terrain and was fast at pulling our van out of some loose gravel. I hope I won't need another tow but if I do I would definitely call Clyde's towing again.< /text>< pics>

<Text>Got my Tacoma stuck on the beach with girlfriends and dogs at South Jetty.  I went into such soft sand, there was no way his tow truck could make it to where my truck was. So the driver Mike was a rockstar and was able to drive my truck out after some digging and compacting. Mike even offered to come back after work with his own vehicle to tow me if he couldn't drive my truck out. Thanks to Mike we were still able to enjoy our day at the beach.  The whole time Mike had a smile on his face and enjoyed the challenge. EXCELLENT SERVICE</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Carl’s towing was amazing! I believe the gentleman who helped us was named Josh. He was very professional and kind. He loaded our truck on a flat bed- carefully and with care. I’d highly recommend Josh!<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>What made me come here is a previous experience. The older woman who use to be here was so lovely. She made sure my kids were happy with their purchases. So even though I'm not a big donut person, when I do want some or the family does we came here.
They have the usual delicious fair of donuts, croissants, sandwiches, juices etc.
We got several fancy donuts, i.e. bear claws, and 3 croissants with ham and 🧀 and 2 with ham, cheese 🧀 and jalapeños.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMldNwQkLLmBTkKHbC_vUHHcA0foa5CUGTobnqH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMemZ52I8UF4EdNTTDfUy_7AdEf_S7JO0Kjaz3U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcb7410b220eb5:0xb4fe2594cdbd25f9</gmap_id></record>

Fast friendly service. Wasn't too busy when I went which is great because I know donut shops are always busy in the mornings. $3.75 for a maple bar and a small Starbucks Frapp isn't too bad. The donuts are good too, no complaints.<//review>

Amazing. Donuts. It's no joke that they sell out fast by the time it's past noon--so if you want to try out the popular ones (H&C croissants), you'll have to arrive early.

Despite that, however, I was pleasantly surprised that the donuts--especially the twisted kind--were very soft. I only managed to snag 2 before it went out.

The owner there is also friendly; she told me about how her husband makes them for about 30 years now. Wow.

If you like guessing whether or not your car is going to be where you last parked it, this is the store for you, the thrill seekers. I wont spoil anything for you but this store has a mustyness that you could only imagine smelling in your favorite horror movie but there's beer there.. you gotta do what you gotta do< /review>

If I could give this place less than one star I would. Went in to buy a bottle of whiskey that I’ve been eyeballing. It was marked at 39.99. The guy behind the counter grabbed the bottle and said it was 58.99. He literally marked it up in front of me. (It said 39.99 for the past month). That was the most unprofessional and shadiest liquor store I’ve ever encountered.
And after talking to friends about it, apparently that is not the first time this has happened. The guy (owner?) has done it with beers and cigars as well. Save your money and go to a better liquor store like Ocotillo or Wake Market</Text>

The people were friendly and the store looked good on the inside.  It seems like a good place to get liquor.  But, from my first experience some of the individual harder to find craft beers are way past their package date.  The two i got were regular price and stale.  Not quite sour but two years past the date.  I would like to give it another chance but that was a bummer to see the huge selection and get stale beer</Text>

Cesar is the man! Cesar is one helpful guy and does not try to sale you things you don’t need. He is very knowledgeable about his products and loves to help his customers.

Even tho it’s a pawnshop, the items they sale are not broken. Love how they back their products. From jewelry music instruments Vedic games and other electronics. Highly recommend.</review>

<Time>1546740459650<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I needed a loan on my PS4 for an emergency and I'm so glad I went to these guys!! The terms of the loan were more than fair, giving me 4 months to repay. In my home state of Colorado, all loans last only 30 days so this was a pleasant surprise for me!! I had great conversation with the cashier and it was truly a pleasure to do business with them. When I repay my loan, I'll probably end up shopping there too as I saw a good selection of stuff that I'm interested in! I won't hesitate to do business with these guys again in the future and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fair deal.<//Text>< pictures>

I went to this location to sell my bracelet. Before going here I went to other locations to see who would give me the best offer. This location gave me an offer I could not refuse. Everyone knows what they are doing and very professional. I will definitely be going back.< /Review>

I like the friendly and reliable customer service I can happily leave out off this pawn shop knowing I got a reasonable deal on my items. I have been a customer here for a few years now and I can say I'm highly satisfied. Even if I'm close to my maturity day I can call if I'm gonna be a day late or so and they helped me out .They will decently work out a deal with you.. Thank you for being my favorite pawn shop!< /review>

I found a Great Bike here, The main boss/owner and offer up consultant (Marco) are very reasonable and will negotiate a fair deal for you! If you have had a sub par experience here, you probably spoke with the store manager. He is NOT the main owner and you should contact other members in the store if you are serious about your inquiry and the main boss,  or Offer up consultant. I had a problem with the manager and ended up walking from a sale, The main boss went ahead and reached out to me to make the moment right and I was very thankful!</Review>

Poor customer service. Guy charged me an extra $3 then the price indicated on my ticket. No real explanation for the surcharge. And his attitude sucks bad. Not to mention the prices offered for the loans is a true rip off. Don't waste your time. Go across the street to House of Pawn. Great guys, great prices, and an overall way better experience. The head guy over at House of pawn is friendly and but non tolerant for bs. I love that place. Only came here because it was closed.</Text>

Worst customer service. That fat Armenian is the most disrespectful person ever, came here to pawn my items, as I signed my name on their electronic signature pad that fat Armenian yelled at me for pressing cancel on the pad by accident. Instead of yelling at me, next time explain it better. That guy has no patience at all when it comes to dealing with customers or people in general.< /review>

<text>This place is shady and you need to be careful when dealing with people like them. We had taken out a loan for two rings, one was my wedding ring. The first issued arrised when we past the due date for one of our yellow gold rings. They stated that they already sold it and couldn’t do anything about it. So we just left that alone since we were told they no longer had it. The second issue arrised when we attempted to take out my wedding ring by paying the full amount. This was a year later from our original issue with these people. We had got nearly about 1-2 extensions on my wedding ring. This last time we tried to take it out, they claimed that it does not exist in the system. Instead they decided to give back my old ring that they had originally claimed was sold. They try really hard to screw you over in this place. They won’t let you keep the receipt. They take the receipt back every time you go to get an extension or claim your item. Oh and they don’t accept any form of payment but cash. They have their entire system setup to scam you and wash their hands afterward. And the only response they gave us was “call the police”. The last time we wen’t there they claimed it wasn’t even in the system. This time we went and they suddenly found that they released the ring, to who we have no idea. It appears that every time we went and extended the ring, they accepted the money but didn’t have the ring in their possession. These people are crooks. They are engaging in all sorts of unethical practices and we file a formal complaint with the Los Angeles Department of Consuner Affairs and the Department of Justice. We have photographs of the ring on my hand on a date later then what they claim was the date they sold it.We will be pursuing legal action against these people. The minute we told them that they misplaced the ring, this Russian man began to get defensive. He didn’t even want to give any information about who operates on their corporate level. They even refused to provide copies of the receipts they had in possession. This is not how a reputable business in America should be acting toward customers. This is America not Russia, they can’t treat customers this way and they sure as heck can’t commit fraud against their customers. They are ruthless, and coniving. It brings great sadness to have to have come across this shameful business. Please reconsider who you leave your valuables with, especially ones that mean something to you.< /text>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1551088999951, 'text': "I have read your review under the name of (Galina Babadzhanyan) word by word, over and over and we are appalled from the untruth allegations you accused us of apparently doing. The fact you had to edit your reviews twice goes to show the untruth allegations you have accused us of. Please if you are going to tell your story, tell both sides of it. This response is on behalf of all the staff from A Pawnshop. We looked and reviewed your account on our system and we have you on record and before we go on further first things first, our staff is trained to explain the rules of either pawning or selling to customers before we make the loan. If they agree then we proceed on the paperwork if they don't agree then no worries they are free to go somewhere else.\n\nGonzales Mendoza\nYou pawned your item:\n12/01/18 - 04/01/18\n\nNow here are the rules of how pawning works. I will be happy to take the time to explain it again to you.\nWhen someone pawns an item(s) only the person who pawned it can pick up with the ID, consular or passport they used to pawn their item(s). But if they decided to pay interest for more time then their family, friend, etc can pay only for interest for more time (additional 4 Months) When someone pawns an item we give them 4 months plus 10 days grace period plus an additional couple of days (complimentary). So for example\n\nLoan for $100\nInterest is: $23.50\n\nYou got 4 months+ 10 days grace period+ couple days (complimentary) To pick up your item you must pay what you borrowed plus interest. If you pick up before your due date your total for\nPick up is: $123.50\n\nHere's the best part of pawning, if you don't have enough funds to pay for example loan for $100   +$23.50= $123.50 to pick up...don't worry you can pay interest $23.50\n(And we give you an additional 4 months) and a new receipt (yellow ticket) how amazing is that?\nNow here is where it gets clearer\nFor example your item:\nYou pawned it 12/01/18\n(We Give you 4 Months)\nYour due Date: 04/01/18\n(Plus 10 days grace period day)\nSo you have until 04/11/18\nAnd remember I told you the system gives you some complimentary days?\nYour absolute last day was 04/25/18\nYou lost your items but we still ended up giving you until 04/25/18 to pay interest for more time. (Yes you did pay interest couple of times. But the last time you paid interest for your item(s) was on 12/01/18.\n\nYou came into the store today\n(02/24/19) to pick up your items\nWhich by the way is (10 Months) after your due date\n\nSo by law we did nothing wrong (in fact we were doing the same process we have been doing for many years and that is our job) and everything you have accused us of just doesn't add up. Now we get hundreds of customers. How do we know when you will pick up your items? There are rules, and those rules are applied to everyone that chooses us for their pawning needs. In addition we give every regular or new customer our yellow business pen with our address and phone number everytime they pawn their item(s). Just in case they have any questions, they can feel free to call us. We will be happy to help anyone with any question they might have.\n\nI can go on and on but Google has a limit when it comes to replying to reviews. I hope you learned how pawning works. Its simple you and your husbands mistakes are the reason this all happened. I just hope you take full responsibility for your actions and realize you can't blame others for your mistakes. Which can happen to anyone. But you chose to blame us. If you don't want to see and accept who was in the wrong and still want to take legal actions by all means we would be happy to explain the rules and situation to anyone you are with. We have your record and our copy of your receipt which by the way all the rules are printed on the ticket which include the due dates and all info which we would he happy to show your lawyer and he/she will see that your story and accusations don't add up. From all of us at A PAWNSHOP may you have a good day or goodnight. :)"}<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2969c30c9e495:0x96ea5bf4ca5b186b< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
with a lot of respect but the owner believe that he does not know anything about watches I have an Aerospece breigtling that I bought in Beverly Hills for 4,500 I took it with this gentleman owner of the pawnshop and he told me that it is not authentic

Here is the point what happens that my girlfriend bought her a ring here at this pawn shop $ 350 a month later my girlfriend decided to go and sell it herself because she dont like it anymore and the man only offered her 45 dollars. I think it's good that make  business but not steal from people I think He say  that my watch is not authentic because he looked at me angry because of the offer of the ring because it was ridiculous to me that you pay $ 350 and after a month is $ 45 I understand when you buy something you are debited but gold not so much

My people l invite you if you need to sell something by necessity you can do it by earning a lot more money online  never never go this pawnshop do it yourself ..Craigslist ...OfferUp .... 5miles....eBay<//Review>

Wouldn't come back here, Needed to free up some emergency cash for a few days or I wouldn't have been in this shop in the first place.                                                                                                                       A. The manager/owner (Asian guy) is incredibly rude.                                                                                                         B. Same manager tried to charge an illegal storage fee. Had to threaten him with calling the police to get him to remove it, and even then he was very rude about it. Not my fault you're breaking the law sir.                    C. Same manager is also hilariously bad at math for a pawn shop owner. If the 3 dimensions of an object measured in inches added together = less than 36, then the item is less than a cubic foot. Took him about 5 minutes with a calculator to work that one out longways...< /review>

These guys are under new management and are better than the old management someone named Mike is the new boss and his workers Cesear,Fermin, and Marco are a great help. Marco helped me out on their instagram account to get a deal on a guitar and they all just work great I really recommend them.<//text>

Extremely Poor Service.  They close earlier then advertised,  I drove from San Francisco to get my stuff on a Saturday.  Got there 10 minutes before closing.  They said they were closed, I stood at the door explained that I drove 500 miles, they still refused to help me.  Could not get my stuff, had to drive back on Sunday morning.  Trip completely wasted.</Text>

I had a great customer service experience. Friendly workers. Mike is just amazing. Really funny and charming guy. The first moment i walked in i was greeted and asked if i needed any help. Marco and fermin are amazing. Will denitley be coming back to this pawnshop again. Marco explained they made a instagram account. Had to follow. Glad to hear they made a Instagram account for the shop. Great way to get notcied. I would recommend this pawnshop to anyone who is looking for quick emergency cash or just cash and a great deal. Make sure you show support and follow their. Instagram account @a_pawnshop_818</text>

It’s a Sad thing when you need funds and have to visit a pawn shop!!!

People tend to not get the amount they are looking for but once they have your item they can double their money!!!< /Text>< pics>
None< /pics>
<resp>{'time': 1538002147313, 'text': "Wasn't please? You recently pawned them like literally a couple minutes ago before you made this review. I remember those tablets you brought in to pawn, we don't take those tablets but since you were in need we wanted to lend a helping hand. We explained to you we are not interested in buying. We will help anyone as much as we possibly can. We explained that prices of electronics unfortunately never go up. You have to understand when someone either pawns or sells we have to wait 4 months before we end up putting the item up for sale if the person that pawned the item doesn't end up returning to pick up their item(s). In those 4 months we do not know how many more new models will be announce or released. For example look at the iPhone 7 plus, in 4 months they announce the iPhone 8 plus, iphone 10, iPhone xs and xs plus. We go by how much they go on eBay. No one will ever pay you retail price for an item. We appologize for your recent visit at a pawnshop. But you can't say say you weren't please after you pawned them. If you really weren't please with the offer we gave you, you would have left and taken your item(s) with you. But you ended up pawning them. You ended up giving us a review like that after we explained all the rules to you?"}</resp>< Gmap_id>

<time>1622739208026< /time><text>Once again Dr Kenneth Lee and his team did another wonderful job. I was relaxed being with them. The procedures went smoothly, no post op pain at all. Amount of sedation was perfect. I have been using their services for years and can't imagine using anyone else.
Also, all of the office people are wonderful, the office is smoothly and efficiently run. I also use Gin as my hygienist and she is very professional and a delight to be around. Liz is the office manager and is very proficient at her job, but even better as a person, she is lovely.
In summary, it's too bad I can only give 5 stars, I think they deserve 10</text>< gmapID>

<date>1543962754543</date><Review>I called yesterday for an appointment, a lady took all my information, and asked if I had dental insurance. I would be paying cash. She said Liz would call me back to make an appointment. Six hours later, I called to find out what happened. I was informed that Liz was too busy to call me back. I asked if anyone else could make an appointment. I was told that Liz manages all the doctors' schedules. Liz would be calling me today. Funny, no phone call. I cannot review how great these dentists are because apparently I'm not important enough to call. Maybe because I don't have dental insurance.< /Review></record>

Major dental phobia. Loved the idea of being put to sleep and getting all my dental work done in one go. Went in today to get X-rays and consult. First of all, absolutely amazing staff. They know who their patients are and they immediately put you at ease with their friendliness and assurances. Every staff I engaged with from checking in, getting my temperature checked (COVID-19), X-rays...to when I said bye was a great experience. The dentist was good about explaining everything including his experience and background and even checking in about not probing around in your mouth if it was uncomfortable.  No work done yet, but I’ll be scheduling that soon. If today is an example of how this office and staff operate, I feel like I’m in good hands and that’s saying a lot for someone who abhors the dentist.<//review>

I had my first xrays and consultation today. I haven’t been to the dentist in 6 years for the trauma I’ve experienced with my teeth. I was so close to panic attack and they kept me so calm and reassured. They made sure to even speak carefully as to not trigger anxiety. I feel so grateful to have found them for all the work I need done. Will continue to update my review.</review>

<Review>My son is autistic, non-verbal who requires sedation for his dental work.  He has been Dr. Lee's patient since he was 10 years old (he is now 20.)  Dr. Lee and his staff are always caring, courteous and patient making an otherwise unpleasant situation bearable.  They explain the procedure in understandable terms and answer your questions. It's difficult for our special needs kids since they can't express their discomfort so it's wonderful to be able to put them in the capable hands of Dr. Lee and his wonderful office, especially Liz.  Thank you!< /Review>< pics>

<text>My autistic son has been seeing Dr. Lee for over 20 years. We started taking him to Dr. Lee for the anesthesia but we’ve kept going because of the excellent care my son receives. His teeth are healthy and strong, and that’s difficult to achieve when you’re dealing with an autistic individual. I wouldn’t take my son to see anyone else.< /text>< gmapID>

The staff is just amazing and gentle! They made me feel completely confident in my dentist visit. I went for an exam and x-ray but I have extreme anxiety and fear just being in the waiting room of any dentist. I can say that I will go to my next visit worry free and confident my procedure will go smooth.< /Text>

<text>My very good friend and client of 20 years has been seeing Dr Lee since she was a teenager, she is now in her 50s.
I can’t say enough how good everyone  in this office is like family and truly care about their patients, family or care givers.
It’s a long drive for us but would never think of changing doctors,
Thank you to all the staff and doctor

I used to hate going to the dentist!!!
When I was told about Dr.  Kenneth Lee,DDS at Total Sleep Dentistry a few years ago it changed my life go the better. I'm able to walk in his office knowing that I'm in good hands with his entire staff. I had old fillings replaced to all white crowns the best part is that I was able to sleep through all of it!. The office is very nice, staff is friendly . Liz the office coordinator is most knowledgeable and compassionate woman she's always available to answer your question. That's why I'm writing this review BECAUSE THEY ARE FANTASTIC AND AWESOME TEAM

< Review>
I thank god for Dr. Kenneth Lee and his amazing and caring team! Before finding Dr. Lee, I was terrified of going to the dentist. I’m certain it steams from my childhood when you would have a toothache and your parents took you to the dentist and all they would do it rip that tooth out. Because of these long childhood fears, I would never go to the dentist, the fear was still in me. About two years ago I knocked a tooth loose, I was terrified, I knew I would have to face my fears of going into a dentist chair. I did a lot of research on dentist in my area. None of them made me feel comfortable. Then I searched outside my area and I came upon Dr. Kenneth Lee at Total Sleep Dentistry… keep in mind his office is 20 miles from where I live and in LA that’s pretty far with traffic. I made my first appointment with Dr. Lee and he assured me this would be painless and that I would be happy with the result of my loose tooth. If I’m being honest – he was absolutely right! It was painless, and my fear of dentist started to go away. I went back for more visits for more work that needed to be done in my mouth so that I can have beautiful teeth and a great smile. Each and every time I was treated with great care and friendliness from Dr. Lee and his staff. Today I walk around and I smile with my mouth open, I never used to do that before (I always smiled with my mouth closed). Now I will continue going back to Dr. Lee for regularly scheduled cleanings and more cosmetic dental work in the future!
Thank you Dr. Lee and team for making my fears of the dentist go away completely now, and thank you for giving me my smile back!!!!

See you soon,
Anthony</Review>

Dr. Lee and his staff (especially Liz) are the absolute BEST! I have been going to Dr. Lee for maybe 8-10 years now and would not go any where else. I had dental trauma as a child and had been having panic attacks all of my adult life just thinking about going to dentist. Before Dr. Lee I went to a horrible so-called "sleep dentist" who overdosed me on Halcyon to keep me in the dental chair so that he could take my money. Then I was introduced to Dr. Lee. On my first visit everyone there was completely understanding of my dental anxiety and did everything that they could to make me feel at ease. Because of many years of dental neglect due to avoidance there was a lot of work to be done. Dr. Lee did everything with kindness and respect. None of my fears were "too crazy" and the whole staff really cared. They walked me through every step of every procedure and if there was anything that I didn't understand, Liz would sit down and explain everything to me. I had always been nauseous with anesthesia but never once with Dr. Lee. They make sure to make it a completely safe and pain free experience every time I'm there. Over the years I have been both a cash and an insured patient and have been teated wonderfully in both cases. They have always understood that I am a regular working class person and have done their best to make what I need financially feasible. On multiple visits there I have seen them with many disabled patients and have marveled at how well they take care of them as well. I will never go to any other dentist but Dr. Lee PERIOD and I will continue to refer him to all of my friends, family and loved ones.<//review>

The staff and Dr. Lee are truly amazing! I think the whole office is gentle and caring which takes your anxiety level down-even without medicine They truly want you to be comfortable and understand your anxiety about being at the dentist and offer you a treatment plan that works for you.< /text>

<Review>I've been a patient of Dr. Lee's for some 16 years. He is the best.......period. His staff is the best......period. Everyone there is extremely understanding and supportive. Just really good folks! Quality people who care a whole hell of a lot(pardon my French) about what they do and put that 110% effort in on a daily basis. You will not find a group of people more giving of themselves in assuring that you have a great dental experience. Truly inspiring and I'm so thankful for them. If you're phobic like me, give them a try.......you won't be disappointed.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<text>First thing I got to say is that monster burrito is legitimate a monster. Not only is a Big Burrito but they pack it full of goodies. They have a really robust and variety the menu of different tacos and burritos to try. Some combinations I've never even seen before. Personally I was a fan of a surf and turf burrito which was great. The tacos are nice but the seafood options are exemplary. I had two fish tacos yesterday and that alone was a meal worth coming for. Prices are reasonable especially if you come on taco Tuesdays and portion sizes are just phenomenal. Only thing that would make this place better if they sold Margaritas but there's a nice liquor store next door so you can pick one up to go. Overall definitely a place I would hit up in Huntington Beach on my way back home again.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyUXGhnQkKHx-jDXJ4fZmZif-Vhe7Vby3ODxrd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVvLgHpJ1VWkgNbX4PaHFAMJzkx36T6kMD04lJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUQiRf2tXO57irJDvPxGXMXKRI5qbEu4C-8Olk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXUDZ29PIfpDAHMOcLqAqzchF-qgYCS9mHtN9l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Name>Jen Mather</Name><review>We were in search of a giant, tasty burrito. The reviews on here seemed good, so we thought we would try it out. Nearly empty when we got there with one group of three people having their food on the little table outside. The lady at the counter wasn't very helpful, but eventually she took my order. I waited for my receipt which printed out behind the plastic partition, but she didn't give it to me so I headed outside to wait. Not a long wait for two burritos and the gentleman who gave them to me was way nicer than the lady who was thankfully on break.

Our Monster burrito was really a monster. I mean gigantic!! We took a picture with my husband's hand in there just for scale! It could easily have fed all four of us. It wasn't very tasty, though, no matter how large it was I was disappointed in the $15 I spent. The other burrito we got was smaller and had even less taste to it.

Perhaps their other food is good and we just missed the mark by getting burritos.< /review><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

I’ve eaten a LOT of tacos in my lifetime so I think I am a good judge for quality, flavor and quantity.   Lupe’s tacos and especially the shrimp taco is fantastic but the menu is full of Lupe’s take on our favorite Tacos and Mexican dishes ...... truly high above others.</review>

🍟 Stoner Fries⁣
🌯 Monster⁣
🌯 T-Gunz⁣
🌮 Mini TJ Style Tacos⁣
————————————————————— ⁣
🤩 guess what foodie fam? It’s Wednesday and we just found the cure for hump day blues!! It’s Stoner Fries from Lupe’s Taco Shop in Huntington Beach. It’s definitely not our average fries. You’ll get steak 🥩, bacon 🥓, shrimp 🦐, nacho cheese 🧀, guacamole 🥑, and 2 over easy eggs 🍳. I mean that’s pretty amazing!! Periodt. ⁣
⁣
🌮 And don’t wait until Tuesday to get your taco fix. Get your taco fix any day here. We love their mini tacos here. The meat 🥩 was super tender and juicy. And who wouldn’t love mini tacos 🌮.⁣
⁣
🌯 on the contrary to mini tacos, Lupe’s Taco Shop has one of a kind burrito, the Monster Burrito. It’s HUGE. I mean it’s like 3 times longer than an average burrito 🌯. And it has fries in it too. Yumm!! If you can’t handle that size 😉, you can also choose their T-Gunn burrito. ⁣< /text>< Pics>

This is a secret hole in the wall taco shop which is amazing! Fresh tortillas made on site everyday and I got the California Burrito (massive), the TJ Tacos, and loaded steak french fries are delicious. Get the horchata too! Authentic and other locations in Dana Point and San Diego.</review>

Overpriced. Poor taste. Not authentic Mexican food or a poor excuse for it.

Menu was too busy, couldn’t really read it and nothing popped. Very poorly thought out. Still couldn’t find the drinks after looking for 2 minutes.

Customer service was lacking. The girl wasn’t very helpful. Was on her phone when we walked it and was on it while we looked at the menu.

3.99 per regular taco. 3x Carnitas tacos are too soft and almost undercooked, tasted really fishy as though they fry or cook them in the same stuff used in the seafood (wouldn’t recommend to people with allergies).

5.00 per specialty taco. 3x shrimp tacos didn’t even taste like shrimp. They tasted “spicy” and nothing else. Adding lime/lemon made them taste like spicy lemon with sour cream.

Tacos are bigger by 1.25 inch diameter (.75 inch radius) compared to other places but that doesn’t excuse the price for tasting insignificant.

Rolled tacos (taquitos) are mediocre. Better than frozen but not as good as 25 other places out there. 5.25 for 3. Tasted very texmex or American.

The only thing that tasted good was the horchata which was 2.55 for a medium. Did not follow COVID restrictions and allows customers to get their own drinks without sanitizing between customers.

Would not ever think of going back and will tell others to avoid this place.< /review>

super disappointing. Good flavor and it tasted just like how I would expect a california burrito to taste. but it was almost 12 dollars for a burrito that would've costed 6.50 anywhere else. Way over-priced for a burrito that doesn't taste significantly better and is definitely SMALLER other restaurants in the area. Won't be coming back.</review>

First time here.  I tried the shrimp quesotaco and the Sonora taco that has steak cactus beans n guac.  They were very tasty. I would definitely return to try other stuff. Burritos sound bomb!</Review>

Expensive, the potato tacos were so greasy and overflowing with mushrooms and other veggies they looked like an undercooked enchilada pie that had been dropped a few times and with extra frying oil on top. No real discernable tortilla to pick up, a total mess and not very tasty. I drove out of the way because they had potato tacos and was disappointed. Not going to give any place 2 stars because of one food item or one bad experience with an employee, though. The Carne Asada and Carnitas tacos were also expensive and not very good. The meat was chewy and flavorless. So why give them 2 stars rather than 1? The customer service, their fish taco and the chips and salsa were all very good. I would go there again for those and save the $40 I spent on the other tacos.</text>

<Review>This place has decent food but very poor customer service. I am a frequent customer on postmates and have never had issues until today. A mistake was made on the restaurant staff's behalf where my order was given to the wrong person. My delivery driver was kind enough to call and inform me of the incident and I was very disappointed to hear that the restaurant was refusing to remake my order. The app said that the driver calling me was the correct person designated to pick up the order yet the restaurant refused to refund me or remake my order and hand it to the correct person. I used to enjoy eating here almost weekly but will no longer be placing any orders if I cannot trust that the staff will take responsibility for their mistakes and fix their orders. Very unprofessional.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dd25fb87f939d7:0xd41cf292dd071e6c< /gmap_id>< pics>

Let me start off with this is a limited seating establishment. Come on the off peak times so you have a place to enjoy this absolutely amazing food. Ordered three tacos, and I’m a big eater and I could just barely tackle these monsters. The flavor of the meats were amazing. Perfectly seasoned and hot to order. I also had the horchata, which only helped to elevate my experience even further. I highly recommend stopping by for a bite any time you’re in the greater LA area.< /review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>My roommates kept on swearing by this place, so I finally took my girlfriend there. We both got bean and cheese burritos, and we shared chips and guacamole. I will say the tortilla was amazing, however, the cheese wasnt melted all the way through, but the beans were pretty decent. When I had ordered the chips, I had asked for salsa, but when I got it, they gave me guacamole. Since my girlfriend and I both love guacamole, we didn't mind, although I will say their salsa is pretty bomb. Their guacamole is pretty good too, and you get a good amount to go with your big bag of chips. Their chips arent really all that great, but it's hard to make a really good chip in my opinion. As for the four stars? I think it's a bit expensive for what you get. I spent about $22 before tip, which some people might not think that's a lot, but to each their own I suppose.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd25fb87f939d7:0xd41cf292dd071e6c</gmap_id></record>

This is a highly rated “Locals” shop but to say the least I think the locals haven’t really experienced South of the border Mexican food. Just take a look at these decomposing limes. The food is really greasy like extremely the al pastor is mediocre and that’s giving some credit. The staff I’ve only ever had snobbish attitude and almost a rushed felling when ordering. I can go on and on. #wakeuplocals</review>

<Review>Wow! Ridiculously delicious. The shrimp cevieche and mixta cevieche crazy flavor. If you order anything other than the seafood make sure to ask about the specific ingredients because it's not your typical Mexican food. They have a lot of additional ingredients this some folks are not used to Aunt or don't like. But the seafood out of this world.< /Review>< response>

<gmapID>0x80dd25fb87f939d7:0xd41cf292dd071e6c< /gmapID><review>Lupe’s is the bomb diggety.
I’ll be honest we have a favorite Mexican restaurant that is quite a drive for us since we moved to Westminster from HB.  My husband started coming here and got me hooked too. I have only had a few things like their street tacos and their breakfast burritos. Both delish. The burritos are very filling and oh so fattening 😁 at least the one hubby kept getting me. He would bring me one for church as I served at church early on Sunday morning. I’d eat half before and half after and still was full.

A few tables inside (I just don’t think you dine indoors can during current covid restrictions) and some outside. I like they have the little number buzzer device when your order is ready.  I’ve seen those food delivery people like maybe DoorDash pick up there.  So far they’ve always gotten our order correct and the staff has always been nice. One of our favorite places to eat</review>< Pictures>

No good! Expensive, salty, takes to much time and it doesn't taste good.
I work all around orange county and this are the more expensive place around. The food is not good as I though. I've been in better places with better taste and better price. Not recommend it in my opinion but you are free to try.< /Text>

Doesn’t even taste like Mexican food. Not worth spending 10 dollars on burritos here. Too expensive as well.< /text>

Tacos are great. Carnitas and tripas are my fave. The girls at the register are polite. Dated decor but clean. Free beans, chips, and salsa with order. FYI Went recently and they removed the salsa bar, stopped self serve drinks, had sanitizer out, and no contact when exchanging money. The girls just bring it all to you. Good to see they are taking extra precautions. Definitely recommend.</Review>

I haven't had ANYTHING here that wasn't AMAZING! I Love a good Burrito... No, I  ❤️L O V E❤️ a Good Burrito! Living here in Orange County,   I can LITERALLY throw a stick, and hit a taqueria. So imagine my surprise when my sister told me that the Best Burrito in the Whole World was at a little shop on Springdale & Bolsa. Being a little skeptical at first (I'm an Aires... It's not my fault), I first tried (for me) the make-it or break-it meal for ANY Taqueria worth their weight in sal, The Carnitas. It was LOVE@1STBITE. Lupe, I've been your slave ever since, and I'll never leave you!</Review>

Unfriendly and rude Mexican lady working here with expensive prices, okay food, and without much seating. The value is not good, but the location is smart to be near a school where the students don’t know any better. Not a place to sit down and eat, just more for the local loner or the family who wants to order ahead and get food that goes soggy anyways. Not authentic Mexican but Tex Mex<//review>

Super tiny place but good food. The mini tacos are great. Pastor  and chile verde are my favorite The only thing is that they sell everything separately. If you buy a side of guacamole the chips are not included, etc.< /Text>

Great food and fast service. I liked the bowl with a wide selection of items and they were fine skipping the rice. Small front but always seems to be full at lunch time, so impressive that they prepare the meals so quickly.</review>

First time here and I tried one fish taco,had the alpastor bowl and lupe fries. The fish taco was delicious great sauce they add. Bowl was actually good tasted great. Lupe's fries were amazing the fries were really crispy and the carne asada tasted amazing and tortilla at the bottom was a great idea. You can make a burrito out of the fries. The salsas were not spicy for my taste but for some that dont really have spice in their life they're great.<//Text>

Saw all the Yelp reviews of Lupe's canceling delivery orders, and I ended up getting the same treatment   Worst service ever   The restaurant canceled my Doordash order well after the delivery ETA, leaving me and my family with no food  and zero explaination.  It's not a Doordash issue; look them up in Yelp, Lupes is doing it to everyone.  Great way to treat your customers, delivery service and their drivers.  I really hope Doordash stops carrying Lupe's so nobody else has to deal with this problem.<//Text>

<text>I’m giving them a 2 based on customer service. When they make a mistake (like letting food sit there for 30 mins without pushing a button to say it’s ready) and then not taking responsibility nor offering to re make the now very old order...<//text>< Pics>

Wife I ordered a surf and turf burrito and lupes quesadilla with a large guacamole. When they say large, they mean it! The surf and turf burrito was wonderful, full of shrimp and steak in every bite. The tortilla was heated to a nice crisp texture and didn't break with all that it was packing. Would highly recommend! The lupes quesadilla is a nice carne asada and guacamole mix. It was wonderfully mixed together, each bite in the center having all the flavors. Definitely give them a try!< /text>

The best breakfast burrito in the neighborhood. Get the California breakfast burrito, dip it in some of their tangy, delicious salsa verde, and go back to sleep. You’ve earned a nap. Best hangover cure.<//Review>

I showed up 835pm and my food hadn't even been made. I get my order after two other people, drive home, and then open my food up to see that it was steak fajitas not the shrimp I ordered. I called the restaurant, get placed on hold. I, then get asked if I'm going to come back. When I get there, they offer no apology. Instead, I get questioned as if I'm lying, he takes the container, sees that it's in fact steak not shrimp and tells the cook. I am given my food moments later with still NO apology. Terrible service that was not my fault.</text>< resp>

The food itself is barely decent. They mess up orders, especially if you get more than one item, and then they don’t pick up the phone. Multiple 1 Star experiences, this place sucks.< /Text>

I drove here because of the one in San Diego. That place is amazing.

This place, however, isn't so great. Service and stuff is fine, but the food is just bland and mediocre. I was so excited to see that there was a Lupe's closer to me. Oh well :/< /Review>

I hated the way they treated us. I've tried several times, but it makes no difference who is serving you, they're all rude. They food is so-so. They charge $2 to put sauce on you burrito and make it a wet burrito. My opinion, miss this place drive a little further to the corner of Westminster and Edwards and get a real serving of Mexican food, good prices and wonderful service.< /Text>

<Review>Busy little place... Carne asada was not seasoned as good as East LA, but burrito was huge with medium cherry coke... All for $10.50... Probably won't be back..</Review></record>

<text>Lupe’s is small, quaint, and friendly. We’ve been there a few times and there’s never a wait. Tons of people do pick up orders. The food is great! Huge fan of their fish and al pastor burritos, as well as their fries!< /text>< date>

I love how they're not afraid to try out new things.  Their fresca of the day is usually good.  I would recommend going with their burritos or fries here.  Their Al pastor is best in town.  Small little restaurant in a strip mall.  It's definitely not an eat in place but the food quality makes up for that.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Surprised! Yummy! Loved it!! First words that popped into my mind, I will be back!! Good service, great food, nice portions. When they named their burrito monster? Lupe's Taco Shop was not kidding! I went with 3 adults and 2 children...everyone liked their selection and food!< /Text>

The inside has a pretty nice technological setup. Food was good, but not the best? I really wanted carneasada fries but it wasn't on their menu. When I walked in, I stood there for awhile because the cashier hadn't acknowledged me. I probably would come back for the location, but I might ask about the fries next time<//review><UserId.>104055108743941609412<//UserId.>< Response>

Soooooo good! We ordered the California burro,  the hot Cheetos burrito, and 3 rolled tacos with guac. Everything was amazing but the hot Cheetos burrito could have used more hot Cheetos. The horchata is the BEST. and so is the guacamole! This will be a staple stop every time we go to hunington beach now!!< /Text>

< review>
I found Lupe's first at their Dana Point location and fell in love, so I was very happy to try this location as well. The line can get long around lunch time but ordering ahead is always possible and even then the wait is worth it. The menu options are deep and diverse, with a lot of options that are perfectly suited for Instagram style posts like the Flaming Hot Cheeto burrito (a must try!) or the California Burrito. It's basically the same as everywhere else, but better. I recommend switching it up and getting it with the Al Pastor they have roasting on a spit all day.

The tacos are also great, with a variety of specialty options that you won't find anywhere else as well as traditional street tacos you can get for cheap. Again I have to recommend that Al Pastor, it's unreal how flavorful it can be without too much grease like a lot of places. And if you like it spicy, be sure to get the habanero salsa on the side because it's amazing and actually spicy. I know lots of places will say they have something spicy and when you try it you just go "Meh, I mean it's kinda spicy" but that salsas is actually spicy and delicious and I put it on way more than just Lupe's.< /review>

<time>1500176214978< /time><Text>I'd say probably the best most authentic Mexican food in Orange county. And everything is so well priced. If you're feeling hungry get a burrito. A couple tacos will curb a craving. However if you want a cuisine based quest, attempt to take on the either the t-gunz or the monster burrito. Be aware of becoming addicted!</Text>< Rating>

It's a small restaurant but they have really good food and it's cheap. You can get a burrito the size of your arm for 10 bucks and it'll be the best burrito of your life< /Review>< pictures>

Ordered here from Doordash. I ordered a burrito and paid an extra 2.50 for them to make it a wet burrito and once I received my food, the burrito was dryer than a desert. And rice was all over the place. Thanks for rushing the ordered and not paying attention to detail or your orders. Never ordering here again</review>

Lupe's is my go to when I'm in the area. Great tacos or burritos. It's a bit pricey at around $9 for a burrito, but great quality.</text>

<text>Was on our way down from Six Flags and we saw a video on facebook we decided to give it a try and  I can say the burritos are HUGE !!! really good and you can taste that it was made fresh. Also, the fries they use to put in the burritos was crunchy not like other places they are soggy. Also, employees are friendly.<//text>< Resp>

I called in an order at 10:40 am for 2 things and they told me 10-15 min I get there at 11:05 pay and then they barley start making my order! I got my food at 11:20 and I have a 30 min lunch, another guy had the same problem when I got there as well. Whats the point of ordering online or on the phone if your order isn't gonna be ready? And it's not the first time, it happens very often. Terrible.<//text>

This resturaunt Just straight up drops calorie bombs onto your plate . Portions are in the style of true American excess. With grease ratios Great for all your hangover eating needs. They do have healthier alternatives but let's be honest if your going to Lupe's your not going because your trying to watch your figure.< /review>

The food is a little overkill, but that's actually what i was looking for and it was delicious. I recommend this place for the people that don't mind finding french fries and a taquito in their burrito.<//Text>

Got the chicken quesadilla and it was really greasy dripping out when you lift one and overall it's small place not much a place to eat inside, there's outside tables as well. Service was quick. No PUBLIC RESTROOMS!!<//Review>

I tried out the California Burrito and al pastor tacos. The Cali Burrito has always been my favorite burrito variation at the local taco shops and Lupe's is good. I could see the cooks freshly frying up the fries which is always a great sign of quality. My tacos were large and complimented with the usual garnish of onion and cilantro but also included crema sauce. I'm also happy they were not stingy on handing out salsa. The only drawback to this place is the extremly small dining space.< /Review>

Tried the carnitas tacos. Got gristle. They also came served with pico and guac. Tortilla was far too wet to make a good soft taco. My guess is this would be a place that's good for burritos, but for tacos, give it a hard pass. 👎< /Text>

<Text>I used to like this place but their service getting horrible. Order a Carne Asada burrito Togo and when I get home it was a bean burrito...WT.....Beep....No hot sauce either.
Why would anyone having Mexican foods without Hot sauce or salsa? Time to look for another place.😠< /Text>< pictures>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>I was in the area on a Sunday and was looking for a breakfast place and I used Yelp to find Lupe's Taco Shop. The place looks hip and funky like something you'd find on the Baja Coast. Pretty decent size menu that carries all the Mexican staples like burritos, tacos, quesadillas, tortas, and more.
I had the beach breakfast burrito which is eggs, sausage, bacon, cheese and sour cream and it cost $5.69. It was really good and I could definitely see myself coming back for another one day or possibly giving their lunch and dinner menu a try.
The service was really good also the lady at the front was super friendly and helped me pick the right breakfast. I'd give this place a 5 star but I'd have to have another good experience before that rating is earned.</Text>< pictures>

I have the Lupes special which has Carne asada and bacon. I went here to look for the monster burrito my friend told me about. I did not see it on the menu and the few people there didn't order it so I am assuming it's a off menu thing. Only bad thing is the female staff member taking our order was not very inviting. Kinda gave that vibe of just order and don't ask any questions.<//Review><user>115633378671592030830<//user><username>Brad Barreras< /username><date>1472247927065</date>< Rate>

Taco Tuesday will never be the same since I've tried Lupes. The street tacos are $1.60 each and you can choose from carnitas, pastor, asada, pollo, and fish. They also have a shrimp taco fur a little extra. It gets busy though and the food can take awhile but it's worth the wait.</Review>

< Review>
The Fajitas Burrito is my favorite.  The Lupe's Burrito is bacon and carne asada awesomeness with grilled onions and more. GRIPE: order for here usually becomes order to go and then you  are missing the free chips....this happens to me almost every time, and again today...very irritating....were they just out of trays? Probably,  but I want my chips....btw, all of 5 chips....better than none. Lol. Shared salsa squeeze bottles means you get everyone's germs who used it before you.<//Review>

I have honestly never had a bad meal here. They have a large menu, with everything from breakfast to tortas, carne asada fries, great fish tacos, traditional dinner plates, and some amazing and unique burritos. Best chimichanga around, if you're into that sort f thing.. friendly staff, great local feel.
Try the chicken soup on a chilly evening sitting outside, super tasty!</text>

Place is clean. Ordered for 8 people and they got one of the orders wrong. Food was ok but I think you can find better.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very rich food and Mexican snacks !! ... There is a wide variety of dishes, but the Tlalpeño broth and the Monster Burrito are delicious! ... they also accept a credit card ... The only bad thing is that the place is very small enough to eat there, then the advisable thing is to ask to take.

Muy rica comida y antojitos Mexicanos!!... Hay amplia variedad de platillos, pero el caldo Tlalpeño y el Monster Burrito están buenísimos!!!... además aceptan tarjeta de crédito... Lo único malo es que el lugar es muy pequeño como para comer ahí, entonces lo recomendable es pedir para llevar.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dd25fb87f939d7:0xd41cf292dd071e6c< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>
