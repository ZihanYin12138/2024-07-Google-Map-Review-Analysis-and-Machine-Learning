The bar earns five stars - the Karaoke Jockey of August 2019 earns zero stars - minus ones if that's possible.
We drove from Arrowhead Lake because I was told by Bear Claw personnel that Karaoke started at 9 PM.  We finally left at 10:15 because the KJ (who had finally got there at 9:45) showed no sign of getting ready to start.   Until they replace the KJ with someone who actually feels responsible for showing up on-time, I could not recommend bothering with this place.
This is very unfortunate because the live band, which was still performing when we got there early, was very good.  The two servers at the bar were very good, the drinks and prices for them were great, and the customers were a wide and varied assortment of people on the mountain.
If you are coming for a bar with live music - Do it.  If you want Karaoke - not so much.</Text>

I've spent nights just drinking coffee ladies make a good cup of coffee. Cater to Travelers the locals. Very friendly staff . The locals are very friendly lot of great stories exchanged they're very informative of the mountain itself. Lots of fun for everyone. I've had fun singing karaoke. It's always a great Drive and always a great motorcycle run. The Freedom Day Parade is always a great time and it's my favorite destination to wind up when I'm there. All you clampers this bar is very clamper friendly. Clampers make sure you stop and take care of these people will take good care of you. I'm proud to wear their t-shirts they're very nice t-shirts be sure and get yourself one. I own 2 myself</Review>< pics>

New to town and decided to try this place out. Everyone is very friendly, service was good, and drinks were affordable. There's a pool table, darts board and sometimes a DJ. We'll be coming back to this place.< /Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>this place is not very friendly. I have been coming here for the past 10 yunfortunately we were asked to leave because someone complained about the picture taken.we never had a problem, until new owners took over. my wife and I enjoyed this place as we took pics for our own memerabillia. I believe it was racial. My skin may have been too dark.my wife has a condition where she cant be upset of anything.It was my wifes pre celebration to her Bday.Needless to say, legal action will be taken as to the   security staff did not fully investigate the situation as to the extent of the situation. It could have been easily remedied. Just to clarify, we ware residents of this mountain community for 12 years and we never had a situation as this.</text>< pictures>

This place is nothing but a lie.
The owner is not to be trusted.

We left a promo DVD for the owner to review for a possible gig as dj.
He promised to give the job to me. When I asked for my demo back, he always had an excuse not to return it.
Then, he hires another dj.

This place would be so much better if the cab find ask who knows how to mix. They always play junk song ends, Then the next one starts. This causes people to stop dancing.

Hey! How about music videos!

I don't think this place knows how to keep people dancing and drinking.

The already scared off the gay's.
This place could be better with the right dj.<//Review>

Watched my daughter have her 2nd little tots dance class here. Really great facility, big, tons of natural light. Also ran into some friends playing pickleball, and those facilities are also huge and very clean. Looking forward to doing more here in the future!< /Review>

Great place to take kids with disabilities  and without. The swings have harnesses and the tree house has a wheel chair ramp to get to the top. The center was closed but we sneaked in and got a look at the inside. Very nice is all I can say.< /Review>

Usually I never have a problem here. And I normally come in the morning. Today I came in the afternoon. I dont know what happened but the cashier DANIEL was really having a difficult time paying attention to my order. After he asked me twice if I want and if I ordered the Breakfast platter which I answered NO on both times. He ended up still charging me for the platter. When I told him AGAIN that I didnt want the platter and what i ordered was a breakfast jack combo. He pointed out to me what the platter looked like at the menu which I am very familiar to, only i didnt want it and never ordered it. He then proceeded to argue with me, at this point I got frustrated, coz I wasnt really going to eat something I didnt order. He still continued to argue with me and insisting it was my fault ordering it. And he said “im going to have to refund you” Which is exactly what needed to be done in the first place with an apology soon after I told him upon seeing my receipt getting charged with something I never ordered. This was the first time this happened to me at this Jack in the box location. Considering this is located inside a naval base, where everyone is expected to treat every customer with full respect.<//review>

OUTSTANDING!!

Phalla, helped me move in a out of the storage unit and provided great service.  The place is very clean and tidy.  The prices are really the best around.

I was there for about one year before moving to the bay area, and have to say- I was very pleased with service and online account to handle billing.<//review>

WORST EXPERIENCE -RAT INFESTATION -I dont ever leave reviews on places but i need to share what happened here. I stored here for over a year and moved to central coast. The cost was cheaper than others wich was a plus but when i came to get my things rats destroyed everything. My couches were covered but rats still managed to poop n pee all over them my washer and dryer all the hoses n wires chewed threw my matress chewed threw and poop all over. I had a 4bd house worth of things in there. Everything was ruined. I had no kind of food in my unit there shouldn't have been any kind of rats. I was told when first getting the unit that they put bait out so i wouldnt have to worry about rats. So after spending more than 1500 on storage and insurance for over a year i had to rebuy everything that was in there because insurance doesnt cover rats. I TOOK A BIG LOSS USING EXTRA SPACE STORAGE</Text>

<Text>First time trying this place and I will not be returning, when we ordered they said pizza would be 35 minutes we waited, checked on our order they said another 10 min,  figured hey we've been here this long it took 1:10 minutes to get my pizza out i got home the crust was paper thin and the wind seemed like they had been sitting for a while, I'm sorry for the bad review, two stars only because the staff wasn't rude when I kept asking for my order</Text>< GmapID>

<Review>I stopped in with a cpl buddies now that they’re open again,service great,food was good as usual. But the server was kind of overwhelmed,
the owner was there,don’t know why she was not helping out at all. Then the owners boyfriend came to bar and demanded his beers.  But the server was doing a great job with what she had to work with. I think her name was Deena .Last time I’m going there< /Review>< Pictures>

We placed an order for pick up at approx 7:43pm on 7/27/20.  Pick up said 8:03pm, then changed to 8:21pm.  By the time it was 8:38pm with no explanation as to why it wasn't ready yet and again heard - I'll be right with you... Nothing!  They were waaaaayyyyy too busy serving beer.

Seriously!  A medium pizza, a philly sandwich, stuffed mushrooms and waited an hour and left.  Service was poor!!  I will be disputing my bill for $42.40.  Thank for absolutely nothing.< /Text>

<text>My coworkers and I came to celebrate a birthday here a couple of months ago. The waitress was attentive. When I discreetly told her there was a hair in my pizza, she was very apologetic. She even took it off my bill. I decided to give the place another try today. Same waitress,  no hair this time. The portion sizes are huge!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Waitress was not nice.  Charged us for refills even though the sign on the wall states two free refills per pitcher. Served other tables their food before us even though we ordered long before them. As far as the quality of the food, it was great.< /Review>

Doug and his crew are the best. They are truly a part of what makes siskiyou county amazing. We are a small beef producer but they always treat us great. Always on time always the best. Fieldkill Frank is a excellent part of the operation.Thanks so much, PK cattle co.</Review>

And they do fries and shakes too. They also have a meat deli adjacent where you can get anything you want.. All from local producers. Its a winner for sure.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMQ8xuxVcWJNn-HFZZgmxV-hBK5LuNQPwg9K1m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x54ce44ba61806f53:0x54457b5e849ec3ce< /gmapID></record>

Just left this terrible place!!! They charged me double price, because they couldn’t connect another battery for check the smog. They promised me to check it for free next day and charge only for certificate. Didn’t happened. Conversation with Gary Framn was my worst experience about car service!!! Never come back here again!!!!</text>

<Response>{'time': 1569902827445, 'text': 'Konstantin, I apologize if you misunderstood our conversation.  Your battery was far too low to attempt to get your vehicle to pass smog. It wasn’t reading.  What you were asking us to do was not only illegal per CA State BAR regulations, but it also couldn’t be done and pass smog within closing time. The moment we were to disconnect your battery, it would have needed to be driven at least 20- 50 miles in order for your vehicle to legitimately  pass smog.'}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dd26eb28d1a8e3:0xc4382c65f0421a15<//gmap_id></record>

My AC was cooling poorly.
Expertec provided an Honest  and thorough assessment of problem.
No leak and no mechanical failure.
Simple replenishment of freon.

All for advertised pricing<//review>

< Review>
ANOTHER AWESOME REVIEW FOR EXPERTEC AUTOMOTIVE!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  My family has been going to Expertec for years.  March and May 2020, Shawn took care of my Nissan which needed several repairs fairly quickly in order for me to fulfill my job (engine mounts, CV axle and boot, brakes, tires, etc.)  Shawn got everything dialed in and completed right away; I was able to pick her up the day before my assignment- AWESOME!  Most recently, Gary and Shawn took care of mounting and balancing Pirelli tires, including installing TPMS sensors.  BTW, Expertec is a certified center for Tire Rack, so you can order tires directly from Tire Rack and have them shipped directly to Expertec for installation. Anyway, as it turns out, Shawn diagnosed that the Pathfinder needed alignment, because of the premature toe in wear of my RF tire.  SHAWN comes through again, woohoo!  Gary and his team at Expertec treat you like family and they always provide excellent automotive service.  We have taken our various vehicles through the years - Nissan, Dodge, Jaguar, Porsche, as well as our classic Ford and Mercury.  Their prices are very reasonable and we have saved $$$$$ compared to dealer prices.  I have had horrible experiences with other shady mechanics in the past so I don't make any recommendations unless they are earned. THANK YOU, GARY,  SHAWN AND EXPERTEC!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐< /Review>

Friendly staff and willing to work with you and help explain/ take time on any concerns.  Professional and they dropped me off  / picked me up.  Great deals available in the paper.  I really appreciate them working with me.  Another person who was in a loaner said they had been using them for years. They put my mind at ease and that's really priceless when you can drop off your baby (vehicle), feel like your on the same page with them, and then pick it up and every function better and at where you expect it to. Smooth sailing with these guys and I'm so glad I tried them first for an oil change / rotate and more and more services and repairs since.   They have a lot of professionals working there.  Thank you Manny and ExperTec Team.<//Review>

I've come to really trust this repair shop - and have been impressed with: their knowledge, courtesy, quality of repairs and cleanliness.
I secured a 9:30 a.m. appointment, for 3 relatively common maintenance items - that I was told would be completed prior to 3 p.m. (I paid the bill @ 6 p.m.)
I was shuttled home & back in a filthy van, got no courtesy call on delays,
had to call twice for updates, missed a rare dinner dinner with friends - had to find my car in the lot, had fluid drips on the car grille, and the Hat# still on the mirror.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>This was my first time using this shop and it was a GREAT experience, and I will be using this shop from now on for all my cars. The technicians were very efficient in getting a complete diagnosis of my car, and then sending me a link that showed every spec that they went over. If there was something wrong then they would take pictures or video to show me exactly what was wrong and why they needed to fix it. I could not believe how FAST they fixed everything. I have been to other shops and it always takes a week or longer to get my car back, this shop was only 3-4 days. My car has NEVER been running this good.

This time my car wash in my window was peeled off and they attempted to stick it back on but it wasn’t sticking on one side and they broke the chip in it so I had to buy a new one at my car wash location.  Also I now have black smoke coming from my vents every so often and it smells really bad.

Called for brake and light inspection. Over $100 for them to take 2 hours for the inspection. Go to auto bust for less than half the time and good cheap service. Overall expertec is a rip off and obviously if it takes 2 hours, not professional or skilled.<//Review>

i asked for tire rotation and the office manager and 2 workers said it was completed even thought they didn't because I marked my tires 1-4 before going. when they found out i knew they made up an excuse for why it was not changed. lady in the front office had no customer service and this business has been going for 26 years.. no honesty, would not recommend<//review>

The service and response time was excellent. I wasn’t sure what to expect it is hard to find a good mechanic who you can trust. From the very nice lady at the reception desk to the service tech I spoke with they were top notch. I left there feeling like I received great service from people I can trust. I will definitely be coming back here again.<//Review>

<review>This has to be one of my best experiences at a service shop so far. Matthew Montoya was my service advisor and was a very personable gentleman. He didn’t seem like the stereotypical “take him for all he’s worth,” kind of employee, like I’ve encountered in the past before at other shops. He went out of his way to introduce me to the technician Paco, who would be working on the car in case I had any other questions and also the service manager, Shawn who made me feel like I was a long time customer, even though this was my first time at Expertec. The team operated like a well oiled machine, all very knowledgeable in their field and I will be returning to have more work done there in the future! This is how a shop SHOULD be ran.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>I was very happy overall.  When I arrived the guy at the front desk was very friendly.  I told him what I needed and he was more than willing to help me.  I had a coupon and they happily obliged.  In the waiting room they had netflix on and all the sudden I got a text from them about my inspection.  They point out what is wrong with your car and send pics.  I never scene that before.  I thought that was very cool.  I highly recommend this place.  Price was fair.

$300 to do a system diagnostic just to figure out that my battery was dead and for a new battery... In these hard economic times it's pretty scumbag-like to prey on people who are just trying to get back on the road so they can get to work. Too bad, the hunt for an honest mechanic continues!< /Review>

<text>Took my 2010 Mustang in to have it smog checked. $1,200 and three days later I got my car back. They said I needed a new fuel filler neck and a new fuel canister. Not happy about the cost but ok I gave them the benefit of the doubt and had them do the repair.
Drove the car for about a week and my working fuel light came on. Couldn't put gas in the tank though cause the gas station fuel nozzle kept clicking off. Took it back to Exper Tec and they  blamed it on the brand new filler nozzle they just installed. They said they would replace that under warranty, how ever now they are saying my fuel level sensors suddenly need to be replaced for $$$$. When I said they worked fine when I dropped it off, Chris said some times things can break at any time.
Told them to put the car back together. I'm going to take it somewhere else.</text><Rate>1< /Rate>< Date>

I am extremely satisfied with the service I received from ExperTec Automotive. They explained to me what my vehicle needed and let me ask questions which were answered in language I could understand. Then when I gave my consent, they did what they said they would. My vehicle has  never ran this good since I purchased it. Now I have the confidence to take my vehicle out of town on the road. I highly recommend ExperTec as you can have confidence in the work they do.<//Text>

I LOVE this place!! They had me hooked by a flyer when I moved to Huntington Beach. They were not stingy in their advertising and it shows.  I took a chance,  and I am SO GLAD I did! I now take my car to them for EVERYTHING! The staff genuinely cares,  and the bottom line is I trust them. BRAVO GUYS!!</Review>

<Text>My lights on the panel of my car lit up and the car would not stay on more than two seconds. I was having it towed to the Dodge dealership, however; Triple A offered ExperTec. I checked Yelp and saw 4 1/2 stars so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, it was diagnosed as needing a specific dealership issue with the keys. They were very kind and waived my diagnostic fee. I spoke to both Mark and Andy. The customer service was excellent. I highly recommend them.<//Text>< name>

If I could give 0 stars I would!! DO NOT COME HERE FOR ANY CAR REPAIRS!! The place is full of cheesy salesman but no competent mechanics whatsoever!! The manager Gary is very rude ! I brought the car for 2 basic issues. $850 later, both issues still remained!! A couple of trips back to their shop, they admit they messed up and the salesman I dealt with had the audacity to ask me for more money for repairs for things THEY messed up on my car!!They not only completely misdiagnosed the car, but after I picked it up and drove it home for 5 miles it completely died!!<//Review>

I've been a customer for 9 years and have always had great service. The technicians are professional, but also personable and are great about explaining everything. The waiting room is very comfortable and the restroom is very clean if you want to wait. But they will also take you home or to work and pick you up when your car is ready.<//Text>

I took my vehicle in due to it misfiring.  They diagnosed the issue and resolved the problem.  I was treated fairly and received a discount on my invoice.  They are my automotive repair service of choice!< /text>

<Review>I am so sorry I took my Jaguar here.

They were insured by AAA so I felt they would be reliable.

I wasted a total of $10,000 because of their haphazard trial and error methods for diagnosing an engine overheating/coolant system problem.

I gave up on them after their third attempt at repairs failed and after getting an earful from the manager of how terrible Jaguars are to repair.

The management here does not follow-up with their mechanics to ensure the problem is correctly diagnosed before the work is done.

Please don't make the same mistake I made in trusting this business with my car repairs.<//Review>< Pictures>

Very honest repair shop! I have been a customer of theirs for 5 years now, with 3 different cars. I've had services from oil change, to tire replacement, to replacing a timing belt - all were at a great price (I've checked around), a reliable service, leaving me with a great feeling. The staff is super professional. You will get every question answer, and there is no pressure. I live in Irvine and go there even for oil changes. I recommend this place to all my friends, who go there and have thanked me for sending them there. Honesty, professionalism and a fair price - what more can you ask for?<//review>

< Review>
I cannot believe I didn't make the switch to ExperTec sooner. I hated having my car serviced at the dealership. They were such crooks, but now I have a reliable team taking care of my car. Everything that could go wrong with my car happened and ExperTec was there every step of the way. For the repairs I needed the dealership was going to charge me almost triple of what they charged me here. They offer affordable services and they're all so friendly. I am looking forward to my next service with you guys! Thank you.</Review>

Our car had to be towed to Exper Tec. They were very prompt, polite and, I believe, very fair with their assessment and quote. One of their employees  even drove me to the shop to pick up the car because I didn't have any transportation. I will definitely use them again when needed.< /text>< pictures>

My 89 Chevy blazer wasn't idling right, I took it to one shop before I came to Expertech they told me it cold be several of things one they said major tune up which was 3hund and some change wasn't guarantee to fix problem. So I googled shops and found Expertech great reviews so I tried them. I called Gary he told me to bring it in they solved the problem and I passed smog that also was needed. Great customer service I'm pleased thanks Gary will return soon with my other cars. Your go to shop I recommend highly.<//Review>

<text>DO NOT take your car here for a smog check. So, when I walked in, I heard the standoffish guy behind the counter tell someone that their car didn't pass because a sensor "wasn't ready" and that he needed to drive the car more. I really didn't take notice until the guy gave me the same speech.
My car passed for *every emission and inspection result, but because I had service on the car a few days prior, my on-board computer system had not yet reset. The guy told me I had to drive the car for 50 miles and bring it back. The kicker was he told me I would, in fact, BE CHARGED AGAIN for testing the emission THAT PASSED. Mind you, there is NOTHING wrong with the on board computer system, it just had not "reset" since my service. I verified this with my mechanic (who specializes in repairs of my make of car, but unfortunately doesn't do smog checks) and he verified that my on-board computer is fine. After asking around, I found that most *reputable* smog check stations will ask the question and/or check the sensors before testing the emissions so that they don't take the customers money knowing that it will fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the smog check itself. Seems counter intuitive for a state that cares so much about emissions to tell me to drive my car for 50+ miles, with no where to go, so the computers will pass their test.
End result? I will not go back and give Expertek another $29.99. I found PLENTY of smog test centers that will not charge for a retest.
I'm now going to Gustafson Brothers Automotive. They repaired my husbands Charger a few months back and did an AMAZING job. I should've thought to go there in the first place. AND, THEY OFFER FREE RECHECKS!!!</text>< Pics>

That being said, it's so difficult to find a reliable auto shop, but these guys were awesome! They diagnosed my engine trouble in a matter of minutes. Turns out, I had oil leaking into the engine, which caused the nasty burning smell. They were so professional, helpful, and friendly the entire process and consistently kept me in the loop about my car issue (I'm clueless about cars, they were really patient with explaining). On top of the great customer service, the final payment was the same as their estimate!! These guys are awesome.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

These guys are great, I have brought six different vehicles here over the past several years and always had a great experience.

One story in particular they may remember, my girlfriend at the time had her Honda Accord serviced at the dealer. Next day, the car was totally dead, no power. I towed it to Expertec and they called me five minutes later to come back. They showed me something I would have never imagined: the Honda tech had left a wratchet extension in the AC drain during the oil change, causing water to back up over the firewall and burn out the computer. Nearly totaled the car. They backed me up completely when I took the car to the dealer and told them what happened. No charge. I've taken my Toyota Tundra, another Accord a Chevy Astro, everything to these guys, and have never had a reason to complain. Always top notch service, and no price gouging. I know cars, and know the value of a good mechanic.

Thanks to Roy and crew for running a great operation.< /text>

Took my 1999 Toyota 4Runner in for an oil change. The engine warning light had come on the same day. They charge $115 to diagnose the warning light which showed a stuck radiator . but applied that amount to install a new thermostat and did a radiator flush and the two lower hoses were replaced.<//Review>

Beware of this place:

-Overcharging for check engine diagnosis(Here it was $142.50; Dealships wanted $100)
-A big list of recommendations  -- Just skeptical about it
-When I came in for the free oil and filter change(don't remember the date or have the invoice), I asked Chris if they rotated my tires and he said yes. I told him I intentionally put a sticker on the hubcap to see if they really did the work. I said it's in the same place. He said the mechanic took the hubcaps off and left them when he rotated the tires. I wonder.
-No running hot water in the restroom (at the time)

I went here in on January 8, 2009 to get a check engine lite diagnosis. It cost a ridiculous price of $142.50 total. Before coming here I found out about this place online through AAA approved auto repair webpage. I also read at the local BBB that they were rated an A. I noticed the local Ford dealerships in my area was charging around $100 for the check engine light diagnosis (at the time). I only came here because the Adviser Chris Zemeny bragged about how good they are and so-and-so, and he appeared to be friendly and said he will take care of me -- huh! Other repair shops charge way less for check engine diagnosis.

Chris charged me $30.05 for pigtail wire harness and $47.50 for the labor plus tax and fees. I showed him on my invoice there was a N/C for the labor. I paid a total of $440.09 cash on January 9, 2009. He did give free a free oil and filter coupon.

Chris said my negative battery terminal is broke. He said it was corroded right through. I told Chris I don't remember seeing it corroded before. I asked for the part and I noticed it looked like a straight cut to me. To bad I didn't keep the part. So I had to paid $30 for it.

Much later I checked with the Bureau of Automotive Repair about the N/C of $47.50. The guy I talked to said Chris wrote it wrong or so and he corrected it with him. I can't remember exactly what he said.

I should get $47.50 back, plus $30 for the negative battery terminal.

Also, I should been charged less than $100(the price of two dealerships quoted me at the time) for the engine check light diagnosis. Instead, I paid $142.50.

They overcharged for not being a dealership.

P.S.: Also check at the bottom of the Yelp review page, were it says: 72 other reviews that are not currently recommended . They have a few bad review listed.< /text>

I only take my car to this place because I work right across the street. But most of the time I try to take my car to a place that tries not to give me unnecessary services all the time. I would say be careful of what they tell you. Get a 2nd opinion before you waste too much money. The customer service is very sub-par as well.< /Review>

<text>I had been told a long time ago by another mechanic that I would need major repairs to my car at some point in the future.  When my car started to not act right, I took it to ExperTec because they had done my smog and made some minor repairs a few months back and  I really liked the service.  I was not disappointed.  Liesel broke down the cost of every necessary repair, and the suggested repairs.  She was very clear about what was urgent and what was not urgent.  There was no upsell or pressure to have anything done, which I have had other mechanics do.  In fact, she even went out of her way to help me out with the repairs.  I will be bringing my car exclusively to ExperTec from now on.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Rude and unhelpful over the phone and completely overpriced. When I called on Friday whoever answered the phone quoted me almost $450 total for a single tire with installation, what a joke. The cost of the tire itself was about $70. Do yourself a favor and pass on this place like I did. I found another tire place nearby (I won't say which one because I don't want this review to look fake) which had the same tire and installed everything for $80 total. Just call around. Sounds to me like someone was trying to line their pockets before the weekend, very shady.<//Text>

I was shopping around to get my timing belt replaced. After going to several low budget car repair shops I went to Expertec Automotive in Huntington Beach. They explained to me that even though the budget repair guys quoted a cheaper price that they may not have included changing some seals and tension springs/pully things. After calling the budget guys I found out they weren't including the additional critical elements and they would cost extra, putting their costs above and beyond the costs quoted by ExperTec Automotive. This may have cost me a new engine had I gone to the budget guys.

After Expertec Automotive did the work including finding an aged hose and changing it at no additional cost, everything is running great thanks to Gary and the crew at Expertec Autoimotive.<//Review>

Bread here is delicious!!! 🤤🤤🤤 We come for the fresh Senorita bread. Call and they’ll give you an ETA to come pick up those fresh baked pastries!!! The young man working here patient and polite. My pregnant wife saw a photo of chips on google review was looking for them imported chips but unfortunately that time they didn’t have any so we went to the nearest Asian market (SF) instead.</Text>

Some of the best Filipino baked goods in the area. Marked down because they said they would be open on January 3, but were not wasted my time driving about 40 minutes to buy some pandesal. Very disappointing.<//Review>

Wow! They actually do delivery by themselves!! Had them deliver me bread and it was nice having my favorite Filipino bakery deliver. The delivery guy was kind. They charge $5 dollars which is alright but if it was like postmates or Ubereats, I would've paid more than $5 dollars.

I think depending where you are, they would deliver in the San Joaquin Area and I wonder if they'll charge more if you are 30 minutes away from them since they need to make profits during this pandemic.

I highly suggest that you give them a call and have them deliver. Also give them your address, phone number, and when do you want them to deliver.

They also changed their time as well so, I don't know their delivery times so please ask them so they can tell you.</text>

<text>Arrived today, a little after they opened and the lady greeted us as if we had just walked in to her home. I mentioned it was our first time in. We found the location via Google search for coffee/bakery. she brought over a plate to sample a few pieces of meat. Delicious!! We ordered sweet breads...ready in 4min.. My husband devoured those senirita breads. Nom nom nom. Hot and sweet. We are planning to have lunch there later today. Simple. Delicious.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>I gave a one star because I had to but if it was up to me I would give negative stars. I bought this condensed candy for my 1 1/2 year old son and fed him it. I then took one and decided to try it but once I took a bite I saw movement. Out crawled some kind of live worm/maggot. This is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. I am never going back there and suggest you and everyone else not to go there either!</text>< gmap_id>

Great place and great service. The fish is great, a great selection of toppings and mix ins for the bowls or burritos. They also have fun and creative options like their nachos with won ton chips, or the tacos on Tuesday. And the boba is the perfect refreshment for summer. Oh, and can't forget the spam sushi.</review>

If you've never had a poke bowl this would be a great place to try one. They always ask if you've been before so they'll know if you need some explaining about how it works to fill your bowl just the way you like it. I go to the one in Rancho Mirage which has been using their food truck for take out during the pandemic.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><date>1594406731057</date>< userid>

My favorite. Good service and good food. You pick what you put in your bowl. The burritos are great deals, and they have a great array of teas.</Text>

Great taste and endless options to customize your order.  Ingredients are fresh as well.  Don't worry if you are vegan or don't think you'd like "raw fish."  This place has vegan options!  Gluten free choices are also highlighted for convenience.  Give Haus of Poke a chance, and your mouth will thank you.</Review>

My poke standards are very high, and they met them here. Two scoops of ahi, one scoop of octopus with some seeweed and some great toppings made me wish I was back in Hawaii.< /text>

I typically love the food here and come often and I hate to write a bad review, but I had just ordered a bowl off of Postmates and I’m sad to say that this wasn’t the quality that I had remembered. Every time that  I have gotten food from Haus of Poke, the food was all super fresh and tasty which makes this place one of my favorites in the CV. But this time, when I saw the bowl I was disappointed with what I had got. The rice was chewy and overcooked leaving it in inedible chunks of gooey hardness, the fish had tasted slimy and like it had been sitting out, I was given barely any mix ins (which is my favorite part typically!) I was given 3 pieces of red onion, the ginger was dry and stale?, it wasn’t good. It had even looked disappointing! I was really looking forward to getting my favorite food but unfortunately it wasn’t as good as I was hoping  😕</Text>

Got chips as the base and the type of chip used stayed crunchy until I was done eating. The salmon and Ahi Tuna were both great quality and paired perfectly with the Haus sauce which is a spicy soy sauce with a squeeze of lime on top.

The protein selection isn't the most varied I've seen but the list of toppings is one of the best I've seen at a poke spot. The crunchy garlic and crunchy onion go great with the tuna.

You can also get your milk tea fix here with boba if you choose but the boba is a little on the chewy side so I'd pass on the boba. The taro milk tea is delicious and if you like taro, you won't be disappointed.</text>

<text>Disappointed in my last visit. While the food was as good as usual, they were such in a hurry to close ( it was about 50 minutes before closing) that they rushed us and  put the wrong sauce on my bowl then added toppings I did not ask. They were lucky that I did not mind,. Then they forgot to give my husband the sauce he asked.... I understand being in a rush if it is a few minutes before closing, although it should not matter, but almost ONE hour before closing???? Inadequate service and that is too bad because usually they are really pleasant and patient.... There is nothing more aggravating than the feeling that you are a burden when ordering food...Plenty of other poke places in our area so they have competition and most of all, they need to remember that good, consistent service keeps customers coming back.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Haus of Poké was very delicious for my first experience. Select your base of rice salad or burrito, then and add protein or tofu. They have a great selection of different toppings and sauces/seasonings to complete your meal. I ordered a small size and it was a good size lunch/snack. The selection of beverages is also impressive such as Boba teas, milk tea, etc. Give it try if you enjoy Poké! Clean friendly and fast service.< /review>< pics>

So we walk in and look at the fish sitting there...ewwww, salmon was slimy looking and everything was already chopped and none too cold looking. Teenagers running the place too. We decided against eating there. I'm sorry, but your asking for food poisoning with kind of set up. Just like beef, when you grind or cut it up you are letting in waaay more bacteria then a steak. The fish should be kept whole and wrapped until ordered and THEN cube it, just like sushi bars do. Hard pass! 🤷‍♀️🤨<//Text>

I say four stars since they have only been open a short time. They have a good start. The flavor was good but the portions are off. The price is steep for how small a scoop of fish is. I'd like to see bigger scoop sizes for your proteins and smaller portions of mix-ins.< /Review>

< Review>
Staff was very polite from the get go. First time visiting establishment. Ordered the bowl with mahi tuna. and crab with wasabi aoili, spicy tuna, mixed together than added crunchy garlic, ginger, wasabi sauce. Everything very fresh and so delicious. Very filling, and plenty left for late night eating. Price for 2 scoops and 2 bowls and a drink $26. Not bad!!!< /Review>

Love this place. Being able to choose what you want any way you want makes this place never boring. We'll drive cities to go here at least twice a week. Staff is great.<//review>

<review>Good food, fresh and lots of flavor from the half-dozen times I've visited. Expect to spend about $13-$20 a person. The sheer number of choices can be overwhelming to some.
-1 star for occasional bad attitude from one employee there, mostly from a few rude experiences. Hard to criticize the other staff over it though.</review>< Pics>

Great Poke, their sauces are fantastic.  My only complaint is I always get very little food and it's kind of pricey for their portions.</Review>

I had always wanted to try a chain place called AhiPoki Bowl... unfortunately for them, I found Haus of Poke in Rancho Mirage first (now also available in Palm Springs). Honestly, every other poke bowl I have ever had now from Maui to Florida, has just been disappointing. At Haus of Poke the fish is so fresh and good, the shrimp are normal size shrimp that are cut, as opposed to horrible tiny "salad" shrimp and even the octopus is tempting - same with the mix-ins which are fresh and crisp and the choice of sauces is what really makes it for me. I recommend having a mix of sauces: Haus, ponzu, spicy mayo and whatever the wasabi aoili one is.
Get your poke bowl on a base of salad and you have a low-carb, high protein bowl of power. Yum.</Review>

It is a great place for all "out-doorsy" types :). Hiking through the californian desert is not my thing, but the place looks quite impresive visually. Bring A LOT of water, as the trail is 3.5 miles long and...beeing a desert... you ain't got no water fountains :). Not a lot of wild life to watch out for, except the ocasional "rattle snake"<//text>

After eating here, I became violently ill, i missed work (at my kitchen job) so i decided to take my thermometer in to test out the temps of the proteins they are serving, wouldn't you know the salmon read 62 degrees,   (41 degrees is the maximum holding temperature for raw food) it had been in the "danger zone" for lord know how long, needless to say, if you are going to serve the public raw fish, you need to figure out a way to keep the temperature in safe ranges   this place should be shut down until that effort happens< /text>

Nice place for the whole family, especially for the kids! There are two parking lots on the left and right of the entrance with full capacity after 12:00 at weekend. Two playgrounds for kids, one is for toddlers, the other  is for the elder. Bathroom is next to the parking lot that is close to the playground. You may BBQ here with some shades. You can also practice your balance on the surface of the water, bring your paddle board or kayak to relax here. But please throw the rubbish in the trash can to keep the environment as it was.

The park has two playgrounds, one for the little ones and one for the older kids. But the smaller playground is old. Some parts are closed due to rusting and broken parts. The water is shallow so thw kids can get in but the water does not look clear. We found a lot of dog poop on the sand area. The bathrooms are clean. There are picnic tables and a path to walk on. There's parking.</Review>

Great little place to get some training in and to enjoy being outside.  Water is generally clear and staff have made a good effort to maintain the area (despite some seasonal issues with the wildlife).  Great place for a quiet paddleboard/intro kayak.

Try to get there early otherwise many town folks tend to congregate - wish they would do a better job picking up after themselves and disposing of their own trash.

My vote would be 5 stars otherwise.< /text>

This looks like a nice place to hang out.  I was just disappointed that the water quality is currently not considered safe (not Parkside Aquatic Park's fault).<//Text>

afternoons are very busy here on weekends. smoke and unclean water won't keep the families from coming here. but it's a nice little beach and park area. easy access to the water. motor boats need a permit to launch here.</Review>

A nice place to relax with kids. Very neatly maintained with clean washrooms. A small sandy area and water to play in for kids and also there is enough space to put your tent and relax through the day.
Very little parking space so it gets filled up pretty quick. Will have to park around the residential area and walk.</Text>

Brought my nephews here and rented a paddle board back in 2015. They had a great time. It was a nice place, good facility but the water quality wasn't the best.<//Review>

<Text>Loved this little lake. My first time visiting with family. Perfect for a small group with kids. Grass area to set up a picnic and sand area to set up for a play day at the water. Water temperature was great, not cold like other lakes. Beautiful view. The lake was not deep, so I loved it because my son and nieces could play in the water w out going to far in the deep end. Tables and grills were not available because of the corona virus but the grass area was great to set up blankets and sit under the trees that provided shade. Weather was great. We ended up spending 10 hrs there. Will definitely visit again with the kids.< /Text>< Pictures>

Water is from the bay, not very clear but not dirty.  Children can dip in.  Pretty small and peaceful place.  In came here in a hot day and it was comfortable.  NorCal don't have many hot days.<//Text>

For such a blessed area it was a shame both playgrounds are so old they had caution tape around parts them lacking the ability for full use by small and big kids. But it is a gem for picnic or bbq or small chillout spot. Did have restrooms with soap! If there is a gofundme for new equipment please share as I am sure 5 bucks per person could get it upgraded quickly.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Came here for the first time this week and returned a few days later. Even though I live in San Francisco, I don't mind driving here to enjoy the serene, clean trails and views. Took a run along the shoreline and took advantage of the staircase to get some extra cardio in. Views are beautiful. Parking is ample. Bathrooms are decent. Will be back for a run or Bike ride and may bring a picnic lunch here to enjoy when the weather is nice. The dog park looks amazing. Haven't seen one that big. Excited to bring my dogs over to see how they like it. Overall, would definitely recommend.< /review>< pics>

This is a little hidden gem. Cute park with BBQ grills and right next to the water. Great place to bring the family and have a great afternoon.< /Text>

<Review>The beach area and water was filled with garbage. Not to mention this place seems to be a popular dog walking area. My kids found dog poop in the sand and under the picnic tables.  The playground was nice but would not recommend to take your kids on sunny/hot days, it is not covered and was burning hot. We might've came on a bad day so you may or may not want to try your luck. If you do I hope your experience is better than ours.</Review>< pictures>

<Name>Nise Fono< /Name><Text>I love this place. Family friendly and very convenient on a hot Summers day. I just wish the there were better restrooms and wash area. We literally had to use water bottles to shower our kids. Also, NO music allowed which made for a boring birthday celebration. But a fun last minute option if you're trying to put something together.<//Text>< Rating>

We love this beach. Grew up here and it is a great place to BBQ and let the kids play on the playground. Avoid the nasty water. Take it from me we know it's nasty we see what it looks like when they drain it.</Review>

Nice views.  Benches and tables. Can reserve for parties. There is one bathroom. Place though was extremely windy when we went. Ruined the party as the wind blew off all decorations and some of the food.< /review>

My 4 yr olds love that the water is shallow enough ( not too steep of a decline) for them to go wade in the water. The sand is clean enough to dig in , and there are bathrooms always stocked, water fountains, and 2 smaller play structures in the sandy beach area. 4 stars only because I have always dreamed that they would install a water feature during the summer-- or at least a bigger play structure -- itd be perfect then. And, because parking HAS been funny on a couple occasions (generally the hottest summer weekend days).< /text>

It's an abandoned area right now. City issued a warning not to have contact with the water. It's like a ghost town -- totally vacated, empty, scary. I hope the City works fast to restore this formerly happy place for families in the neighborhood.< /Review>

<Text>Folks are right that there's a lot of bird poop.  It would be GREAT if this were cleaned more thoroughly & regularly.

However, aside from this not-so-minor issue, it really is wonderful:  there is a small grassy patch, a nice sandy beach, some play structures for the kids, and a boat / kayak launch.

Mostly importantly, the water is actually WARM ENOUGH to swim in.  This is the only natural place that I know of in the Bay Area where I can swim in the water without a wetsuit.  I have more fun here with my kids (5 & 8) than anywhere else I can think that we've ever been, nearby.<//Text>< Pics>

Water was nasty.  Isn't that what you want to go here for?  I'm sure there are some days where the water isn't as bad but overall it's not a place I would visit again.  The "sand" near the water is mud.  The seagulls are everywhere.  Let me put it this way, I didn't let my kids put their face in the water.

It's no one's fault, the water is just not good.< /Text>

If you're planning on having a gathering/party/bbq & would like to swim this is an ideal place. There is also a play structure in the sand which makes it a good place for kids.< /Text>

Really cool park next to the water with a beach. Sometimes the beach area is littered on, and it's not as nice when people don't clean up after themselves. But there's a playground structure and a good amount of parking.< /review>

Great park. Has a beach for swimming. Pincnic tables along the shore and a picnic area on the nort end with a unisex washroom.. South end has a boat launch and public rest rooms for men and women. Several grills located along the park and picnic areas. Parking is filled up fast on weekends. First come first serve. Smart and final 1/2 mile away incase you forgot something.< /text>

My five year old fell in love with this park during our vacation, great place to play with sand therefore take beach toys and chase birds, there are signs not to enter the water.
the bathrooms were clean, parking is free and plenty. As mention before there are no water fountain or sodas/snack machines.</text>

< Review>
Stood in line for 35 minutes, after placing the order, we are told their card reader is not working and that's the reason for the long line. Cash only. We are then told to come inside and place the order. Another 25 min line. Manager said this machine goes down all
the time. To add insult to injury, manager told us that our complaint was adding to the problem. Unbelievable. I hope the one opening in LG will actually care about their customers!<//Review>

I cane to place, the drive has a long line. Parking was full. As I placed the order for a chicken sandwich.  Drove up the window,  and saw that workers  goofing around , I was not thrilled to see that.  Is no wonder why this place has longer lines.  And to make things worst, my chicken sandwich was hard to bite into and cold. I threw it away.  I waisted my time and gas, waiting for a cold, hard, not fresh chicken sandwich.  Shame on you/all Worker's at Popeyes as well as the manager and business owners of this food chain POPEYES!! I rate this place a big fat zero! I will not come here, never again.  Warning to all customers,  make sure when ordering from this place. Double check ✔ your order to see if it freshly made or serve old cold.< /review>

I love Popeyes. Tasted chicken sandwich. 1st time delicious. 2nd time around, different location, not so much. Felt like they just slapped it together. I guess it depends on the staff and preparation.< /text>

<Text>It was okay! Yes maybe with inflation the prices are going up. But come on we're talking chicken not filet mignon right? It sure tasted a lot better when it was a little cheaper.But $40 for some chicken, two sides and a few biscuits? What's next selling mini chickens like KFC? I think I'm just going to go to Albertsons to get my chicken.</Text>< gmapID>

The order takereft the mic on and we could hear all sorts of personal conversations going on while we waited..."Oh hell yeah, Im going home." Said by a female voice.  The chicken was cooked DRY and HARD.  I will not go there again.< /review>

I went through the drive-thru last night around 9pm or so and the girl who was taking my order was very rude from start to finish. Her tone and attitude was unprofessional and her Customer service was horrible! It felt like she was rushing me and then would say "anything else" in a rude tone. I let one of the workers know who came out to bring my order to relay to the Mngr. Hopefully the Mngr was informed.< /Review>

Terrible service, always slow, long lines, and something within their inventory has subsequently ran out. Staff seems to always comprise of a bunch of adolescents working to make a buck, negligent of their roles as a worker. Every time (and I don’t come here often) that I’ve came here my order have been made incorrectly by the staff, or something or was made wrong. Management might want to step up and find a new work force because the current one blows. Not to mention nearby area is infested with homeless. Not that it's their fault but makes all the other things even worse having to deal with it.<//Text>

My family love Popeyes chicken, but of many locations I've tried in San Diego this place by far has the best chicken. It's not only super crunchy, but also has just the right amount of seasoning. The only downside is to make sure u double check ur order to ensure u have all the big breast pieces u deserve or else they might cheat u. I normally order the 14 pieces family dinner, but sometimes they only give me 2 breast pieces when I'm supposed to have 3 or more breast pieces.< /review>

I repeated my order four times as she seemed distracted. I pulled to the window and everything was given to me with an attitude. The young lady stood in the window rolling her eyes, rubbing her arms, & throwing her neck back. Unprofessional.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Opprotunity abounds. This location design and layout make it very difficult to park and dine inside; its also very difficult to drive thru. It appears the no one was at the wheel when deciding this locations layout. The product (16 piece dinner with trimmings) was very well prepared and served in a very short time. The service however was far less than expected. The lady that took my order was not able to speak English very well, and she appeared to still be upset with the customer just in front of me. She wasnt able to shake it off and start fresh with the new customer.<//text></record>

<review>I love their spicy chicken sandwich it's hot and steamy when you get it, I can't say to much about their fries being hot. When the fries are hot their even good. The only thing that sucks is the parking. It's hard to get out when the drive thru line is crowded. And it's always crowded at lunchtime.<//review>< Pics>

<review>This was the absolute worst Popeyes i have been to thus far. The fact that they are the slowest and the food was Cold.

Why did they clean up early? They should at least put up a sign outside that their closed already. Or change their hours. They said the other cars didn’t get food either. Very unprofessional and bad service. They sent their customers to McDonald’s next door. Makes me not want to come to this Popeyes location.< /text><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I waited in a long drive thru line and ordered a Classic chicken sandwich. I asked for extra mayo and extra pickle. I took the first bite, the texture was so tough, I thought that I was eating jerky. After eating the sandwich ( first thing that I had eaten all day) I looked in the bag to find this!! No utensil! Old dry sandwich. So disappointed. This location has had the best sandwich and the worst in San Diego in my opinion.<//Text></record>

A lot less greasy than KFC which is a good thing. If you're used to KFC coleslaw your first bite will be a surprise but after a few bites you'll find you'll like it.<//Review>

The WORSTcustomer service I have ever had, I call before going there and asked if they are participating in the T-mobile deal. They said yes then 1 hour later I called again and asked if I can order in the lobby a Togo order with my t-mobile code. The answer was yes as long as you have the code. I showed up there and the same lady I talked to on the phone because she remembers telling me to come on down she said told me that they are not doing the t-mobile deals. So I asked for a manager she said she was so Asked for her to get the store manager and she said they are not here but she will get another manager. The other manager wouldn't even come talk with me just said to tel me no cant do it. We all know that fast food managers can zero out an order. So I said since you told me to come down and I drove 20 minutes could you please ask the manager if he could just give me the deal anyway even if the code wouldn't work he told her to tell me NO but if i buy something then he will give me a small side.

The chicken was crispy and tasty. Macaroni and cheese could have been cheesier. Red beans and rice was delicious.< /text>

The food was great, but after waiting 20 minutes in line and another 20 for the food. I had to go in and see what was happening. I understand they are in high demand, but the customer service was below par and I will not be going back to this one. I walk up to the counter to ask about my food and they say, well we are busy. The employee just walks away. 10 minutes later they bring the food out. They gave me to spicy chicken sandwiches when I asked for the classic and with no sauce. The employee Eddie rudely tells me they cant make any modifications. He tries to walk away. I was shocked by this response. The manager was great and ended up giving me 3 chicken sandwiches and it only took 2 minutes not 40 like I had already been waiting. I was furious because the employee Eddie did not apologize, did not offer to give my money back or substitute it with something else. If I order and pay for your service I expect it to be correct, or fixed. I hope the manager will see this and help train employees in customer service.<//Review>

Wanted to say this is not my best Popeyes.  The chicken was very dry and the sauce was mediocre at best.  I did however love the chicken sandwich. I had the Cajun chicken sandwich and it was really good. Chicken strips, not so much.<//review>

My first time in a Popeye Louisiana and last. The General was at the cashier...I tried to ask a question because it's my first time and all she said is it's just a chicken sandwich you ordered two. I know is it your famous  chicken sandwich...it's just a chicken sandwich you ordered 2...ok ....not nice...< /review>

<review>Our 2 piece combo lunch with a slice of pie for under $20.00 was delicious!!!
I do think your condiments cost must be through the roof!
With our 2 piece meal came 2 biscuits,  (7) honey packs and (16) hot sauce packs!
We used 2 honey and none of the other.
We love your food!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80d953e343590581:0xb60c51e5b2c13ad2< /GmapID></record>

The chicken is very tasty, specially the spicy chicken, and the sides have a lot of flavor. My favorite is the Cajun rice.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I love popeye's and when I had the opportunity to go there and get some lunch for myself and a friend I was visiting we were excited.  However the drive though line was long and there was also no way for me even to get in it seeing as I had came in another direction so I parked, I'm on crutches right now for a pulled ACL and went in to order, placed my order asked for sugar and was given Sweet n Low, was told thats all they had. As I started to walk out I was than instructed to exit out another door. Now here is were I'm not thrilled,  totally understand about the one way in one way out but while I was there not one person before and after me who had gotten orders a lot faster were told to use the other door. But I was and at that point there was no one in line or waiting for food. So take our food back. There was a biscuit missing and I had gotten the 2 piece dark meat, I recieved a wing and leg. Food was still great reason I love popeye's and don't get that often. And usually not a complainer but just an off day.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80d953e343590581:0xb60c51e5b2c13ad2<//Gmap_id><response>None<//response><Rating>3< /Rating>< Date>

Friendly service, parking lot clean for the area, food was hit and great! Good food. Good service. The drive thru line and the entrance & exit are too small. Takes too long to get in or out. Excellent Popeye's location. Very clean, courteous staff, and great quality food. If you haven't tried Popeye's before, it is a Louisiana style fried chicken. The chicken is very tasty, specially the spicy chicken, and the sides have a lot of flavor. My favorite is the Cajun rice. Excellent Popeye's location.

Took our order wrong, and tried to tell me that there was nothing they could do about it and wanted to send me home with their messed up order. Told Eddie he could give me my money back instead and then at that point called his manager, who was able to fix the problem quickly and efficiently. I understand mistakes happen, and I just wanted my order fixed. There was no need for the attitude. Appreciate the manager on duty at the time for stepping in and solving the issue. This happened on 11/24/19 around 7:10pm<//review>

Ever since the popeyes chicken sandwich came out its been quite chaotic, not only for customers but mainly for the staff. But they never disappoint and for that i give props for the great service...
P.s. the mac is great within the spicy chicken sandwich 🤤< /Review>

The prices went up tremendously. It's good but it ain't great... I went there 2 days ago and purchased, 2 chicken sandwich and combo of 3 piece dark meat and it came up to $22 wow.... Thank God I really don't eat fast food like that anymore. I won't be going back for a long time.</text>

Popeyes is one of the worst places I have ever been to. The employees were not polite or helpful. There was no greeting - just " what can I get you?" The place was dirty. Floors were dirty and not swept. Tables were not cleaned from prior customer. I had to ask for a rag to clean the table. Not only did I get attitude but no one offered to clean the tables once I made them aware of the situation.
To make things worse....the food was terrible. I ordered shrimp and they were so small that once you got through the breading there was nothing left. I will never return there.</Review>

<Review>I would definitely recommend the spicy chicken sandwich, there is mostly always a line at drive through so if you get down and go into the establishment you will get quicker service . It is located in a not so secure part of town so just be aware of your surroundings.</Review>< pictures>

Impressed with the staff. Courteous, polite and fast. Way fast. I dined in and one of the staff came by my table and asked how was everything. You just don't get that kind of service at a fast food.

Ordered a 3pc chicken strip meal. The chicken was skinnier than normal. But that was ok because I got full and wasn't able to finish the meal. Ended up throwing out the rest anyway.<//review>

Selling an item (chicken sandwhich) from 11am to 7pm is ridiculous!!
I arrived at the drive through at 6:43pm and waited for over 20 minutes only to be told that this item cannot be sold after 7pm. Ridiculous!! I will not be coming back here. You just lost a good customer.< /Text>

<Review>Not a good experience. The day of the two piece is gone. Now it's all about the upsell. All I wanted was two pieces of chicken but you can't get that anymore. They force you to get the meal for over $8. As long as I can remember you could get 2 pieces and a biscuit for between $1.99 & $2.99. now it's over $5 and you don't even have the option of leaving off the biscuit. A little over $2.50 for 1 piece of chicken is a little much since chicken is the cheapest meat on the planet unless you count rat, but we won't even go there. Even the counter girl agreed the price was way too much. One other chicken store from the south is doing the same thing. So it looks like a trend. Well that will be my last visit to Popeye's. Use to love them but not anymore. No love in return.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
While waiting in line at this location, employees while. Outside taking out the trash, kept mentioning how the sandwiches are gross, they contain lead, they are often dropped, don't eat the Sandwiches. Not taking this seriously we continued to go through the drive through, only to hear the same commentary through the speakers in the background from other employees about the sandwiches.. At this point I felt it wasn't worth it to even continue with the purchased due to the employees and theyre complete disregard for professionalism. I highly recommend that this Popeyes is avoided. When I brought this up with the acting manager, the manager didn't have any real concern about what her employees were doing/saying about the food products that leaves this fast food location. FOOD HEALTH AND SAFETY SHOULD REALLY CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION ON THIS LOCATION< /Review>

It's so good that some restaurants run out of certain pieces like, light or dark meat. However, while they are running certain promotions, they should make certain accommodations so that they don't have to tell their customers, " I'm sorry but we've run out of that." I'm sorry but when you're hungry and you're craving something, that's the last thing you want to hear. Especially when you've waited in line for a while.</review>< Pics>

Did the drive-thru. Very confusing with people cutting in and out of the line because the parking lot was so tight.

Chicken Sandwich was OK. Very salty without much other flavors. Loved the crunch of it though.<//Text>

Ate the 4 pces combo, good chicken, affordable price, not as tasty with the honey, ketchup or hot sauce, they charged extra 0.27cent for the dipping sauce it's dry without it, should be included, i won't comeback.<//Text>

<review>Honestly they don’t even deserve any stars. Bad customer service. The lady from the drive thru had purple hair and was just rude. This place used to have great customer service but they don’t even know how to serve their guest. Thank god I won’t be coming back to this place anymore. Shame on them and I hope that lady gets fired. If she doesn’t want to be there then why did she apply for a job in the first place.<//review>< pics>

went to get the famous chicken sandwhich today and the line was long but i was willing to wait. the service was great and speedy. the girl cashier (didnt they her name) but she had purple hair (super cute) rung me up fast and efficiently. the manager was super nice and helpful despite the fast hustle n bustle. i will be driving from spring valley to this location from now on. i think i might bring my mom on monday.< /Review>

I love the red beans and rice and most of all of the chicken dishes,however the chicken sandwich was not as great as people say it was.  Definitely not worth having to wait till a certain time  to get I. The line outside was crazy.< /review>

< Review>
The management was trash, he didn't know his head from hole in the ground. When they brought her order out they gave it to another car and then they had and then that person went through it so that was disgusting first off because some stranger touched our food! They didn't even remake our food they just rebagged it and brought it back out and still messed the order up they left off information about a promo that they ran out of cups on and didn't bother to tell us and we spent money for extra of nothing. The manager was not helpful he would just blame all the other workers except for himself or not relaying information that need to be told to other peoples in order to buy something to get your complete order. So the whole experience was just a waste of time we are waiting a half-hour for some cold food that's been passed around and touched and I will not be going back to this one ever again no matter how hungry I am I do not care about this Popeyes the management is just ridiculous he look like a space cadet and like he really wasn't listening just trying to get us out of there so is very unprofessional. So do yourself a favor and avoid this Popeye at all costs it'll save you money and a headache.<//Review>

<review>Took 25 min. based on receipt time stamps to get our "fast food". Don't understand why everyone who entered after we did was served their orders prior to ours.  Plus, enjoyed frequent visits to the WC that evening and into the following morning.  "love that chicken from Popeyes🎶" I think Not! Will not visit again.</review>< date>

< review>
This place somehow always ruins orders whether its giving you someone else's order or just not giving you what you what you asked for. Sometimes things like this happends but this has happened several times.

I used to try to give them a break because they're right off the highway and maybe that's why they're always getting rushed but
you always have to wait for something regardless of what time of day. I've been going to popeyes for years and this is by far the worst. Someone send someone from corporate out here because this place is a mess and management isn't training their people properly.</review>

Great food, fast service, and the people running the drive-through were patient with us, as we hadn't been to a Popeye's in many years (don't worry, no one was behind us).
We got spicy chicken tenders, mashed potatoes, popcorn shrimp and red beans & rice and everything was perfect.
If I'm in the area, I'll return.< /text>

Didn't get all our food we order and when i went back to request the rest,the employee helping me rolled her eyes and well we can fix that and continued with an attitude to tell me what else was I missing! Order here before drive thru and never get my order right ...  missing sauces, biscuits, mashed potatoes. I love Popeyes but this Popeye is the worst pop I've ever been to. The employees were rude they ordered the wrong thing I got combos on special they gave me a shrimp combo that was not surf and turf the shrimp pieces we're mostly bread and Tails. And wait times were ridiculous.<//Review>

chicken at this place - super tasty. Food was super flavorful. The service was very friendly and kind. Similar to a cafe in Las Vegas I liked.</review>

Waited a long time over 10 mins to get my first cold chicken. THE order was wrong i had requested white meat 2 piece spicy i returned because the order given to me was cold and it was dark meat when i was given my replacement the chicken was hot and it was white but it wasnt spicy it was regular after waiting a total of 30 mins i gave up and just ate it because at that point i was starving and was already late to my next stop of my day and on top of that the customer service was null the staff stands around and acted like how dare me for asking them to redo my chicken because it wasnt what i had ordered.<//review>

Terrible customer service by both the drive thru staff and the manager. The girl with the braids had a horrible attitude and when I asked for a manager she completely overexarrated the reason I needed to speak to the manager... Right in front of me while rolling her eyes..  and the manager came over with the same attitude.<//review>

Chicken tenders were inconsistent in texture, some pieces were fine, some were chewy.  Suspect some tenders were not cooked thoroughly enough. This location is pretty small inside.</Review>

<text>This had got to be the best fried chicken around hand down. The chicken is juicy delicious the red beans and rice are great and the biscuits are the best. There kids tender meal is a great deal plenty of food for the little ones. Cinnamon apple pies are so good. Since popeye's moved into the neighborhood that's the only chicken spot I go to now.< /text>< gmapID>

The restuarant was fine but the customers were horrible.  Complaining about everything what a circus it was in there.  The women in front of me took over 10 minutes to order. I could hear her tring to change every meal option they had. Another guy was complaining the chicken was old.  Someone else was complaining it was too cold in there. Order your chicken and leave already.<//review>

Popeyes chicken is delicious. No doubt about it. This location is a little on the sketchy side. But, I had great service when I went there a month ago. I dined in and noticed the restaurant was very clean and fully stocked.< /Review>

Got the amount of chickeni wanted at a more agreeable price. The person doing the drive thru was extremely helpful, perhaps too helpful, because the person in front of me had a lot of questions, and Hugo, I think was his name, answered them all.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< gmapID>

The one in Lemon Grove is kind of scary. The chicken they gave me to go looks left over from the day before and then thrown back into the fryer. The chicken breasts were kind of exploded open and that definitely was not fresh in any fashion way. I got there right after they opened and it's like they just didn't care and got rid of the leftovers. The one off of Mira Mesa Boulevard I've eaten that many times but it seems to have gone downhill also. The chicken pieces are smaller and it's just not the same.</Text>

I must admit that the food they gave me was very good, cooked properly, and hot. But I felt like the service could have been better. You can’t just hand someone their food and say absolutely nothing. And that is exactly what they did.<//text>

The food is usually good but don't EVER let them park you to wait for food. They ALWAYS forget about us and today it happened again and they had me waiting outside for 3 blackened strips for 15 minutes, then when I went inside to check on my order I found out they not only forgot me, had not even cooked my food, so I was waiting another 10 minute when I finally said I don't want it and would like a refund. When I left, the food still was not done....😦😕<//review>

I asked to place a second order in the drive through, because I have other people in the vehicle. The lady refused my order. Said it was against policy. I said finecsncel my order. I went to el cajon where the customer service is about and beyond. By the way, I would have spent more than $60. I will not return to this store.</review>

< Review>
I ordered the popcorn shrimp & red beans & rice with a Sweet Tea.  Got my food quickly.  When I opened my box of shrimp it is just barely cooked.  I then I noticed that only one person in the kitchen had the required gloves on.  I then noticed that same employee sweeping the floor with his gloves on. I am not sure if he even took them off after sweeping.  I love Popeyes, but since I work in the food industry and noticed the many health code violations I will not be eating at this location again.  And suggest that others follow my lead before they get very ill.<//Review>

Unfortunately, no sandwiches.  Since I was there anyway, just got chicken meals. Spent much more than wanted, but tired from work and didn't want to go someplace else. This company didn't prepare well for the outcome of its marketing.<//review>

Can't beat spicy chicken, especially on a budget. Soemtimes the line can either be long or move slowly or both. But still worth driving through.<//review>

So busy. Parking lot cannot accommodate the amount of traffic along with the long drive thru line. You will get trapped in there for eternity. I ordered chicken tenders that were not ready and chose to wait the 8 min for fresh tenders. That 8 minutes was more like 15 and the chicken meal I ordered off because they Did not have breast peices. This place was not prepared for the amount of business it had. 2 stars for the customer service and friendly attitude of the staff under enormous pressure of dozens of hungry people who just wAnt their Damn chicken tenders in less than 15 Damn minutes 🐔<//text>

While we were there for less than 20mins. 5 people came in from drive thru because their orders were incorrect.  The employees have very poor attitudes and seem like they hate their jobs. I blame this on the manager and Popeyes Corporation. Once I got my order, it too was wrong....the guy at the front counter laughed and said that was Anthonys fault. I assume the kid that helped correct my order was Anthony. The food was good, thanks for at least that.< /Text>

<Text>Food was cold & some of the pieces of chicken looked old & refried.  Got the 2 eat for $10, I guess you are paying for the chicken as the 2 sides are small.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

The funniest thing is they were mad I ask for a refund like it was my fault. Maybe they got mad because I took pictures of my ordeal.

They removed popcorn shrimp, their chicken still doubles the market average price per piece, they can't seem to get en entire order correct, they're rude about it. Expect to pay $2 more per item than is posted on the menu.<//review>

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. STAY AWAY. Tweakers fighting in the bathroom, no toilet paper in the dispenser, had to use a PAPER BAG! Didn't even receive my food and had to get a refund, overheard another customer complaining of undercooked chicken.</review>

<review>Good food & cooked well as usual ! However there several employees  sitting around and a few out in the customer area eating , sitting around and talking ?  Not sure if they were taking a break,waiting to start work  etc. This may have been better not seen by customers,  especially the employee in uniform eating in the customer area ?</review>< date>

The portions are too small for the prices they ask for, and considering the areas that the majority of popeyes are placed they need to have more coupons and/or change/lower their prices!!<//Text>

My wife just called me and informed me that her order was incorrect, when she tried to have it corrected  the cashier refused and said it was filled, my wife said she was told to come inside and speak to a manager she went in and in front of the manager emptied the items on the table, the cashier continued being disrespectful to my wife calling her a lier and accusing her of being a thief, my wife demanded a refund, I really don't feel a fn bowl of mashed potatoes was worth angering my wife to the point of a refund we won't be back<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The truth is, bad service, the first time it happened to me, I asked them to add a coke and the cashier told me that they didn't add anything extra to the window.
And I said ok and when I go to my house with the chicken I had more than 20 forks I don't know why I miss so many

(Original)
La verdad mal servicio la primera vez que me pasa pedí que me agregaran una coke y la cajera medijo que no agregan nada extra en la ventana
Y dije ok y cuaando yegue ami casa con el pollo tenía más de 20 tenedores no se para que me echo tantos< /review>
