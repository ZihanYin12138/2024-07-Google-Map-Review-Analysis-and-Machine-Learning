Five stars cause the poke here is the bomb .com. Best poke I’ve found around O-side and Carlsbad area. And if you’re on base already, it’s great for a quick bite. Wish they’d have more of a variety for their drinks, but Thai Tea will suffice for now.< /review>

<text>Just think of this place as a bit more expensive panda Express. A good 9 or 10 doll hairs can be spent on a single bowl not including a drink. Don't get me wrong the food is finger lickin' good and their chopsticks are actually good< /text>< pics>

<Time>1612169301595<//Time><Text>Went here for the first time because the menu looked good online.

It was a slow day in the afternoon, & I’m not sure if the service was just having a bad day, but since it was my first time trying it out, I didn’t know there was a selection for bowl sizes because there was no labels on the bowls.

Service gets snippy if you’re not familiar yet with the ordering routine.

Clean establishment & food was average. Prices are a  alright for the portion size. It’s edible for food that’s not truly authentic Japanese cuisine.<//Text><username>C Nguyen< /username>< Response>

This place is pretty good. I'd give it a 5 star if it wasn't so expensive. They also give you a stamp card that's good for Habbachi San and Panda Express. The heavens have surly sent this card.< /Text>

<review>My husband and I stopped here on a Sunday afternoon. They were a little busy. However, I was disappointed with my Teriyaki bowl. The chicken was old and it tasted like chicken liver, you know how it gets when food has been cooked and then held in sauce for several hours? Awful. Was pretty expensive for what we got.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dc6f9692227587:0xd3e2e457af9096cc</Gmap_id>< pics>

<review>Poor Management. I’ve been here quite a few times. It’s usually alright and I order the same thing with the same toppings each time. This time when I tried to get my normal order I was told I would be charged extra for some toppings. The menu reads “all toppings included” and when I mentioned this the woman called to a worker behind me and asked “it’s only 4 toppings right?” To which I replied saying it should be on the menu, and I was given an excuse of “new management”. If there is a change that is made it should be instantly updated on the menu ESPECIALLY if the menu is just a digital graphic on a TV screen...<//review><response>None< /response></record>

Started out amazing and loved every bit of it.  Then slowly got worse and worse.  Started with one of the workers yelling at an elderly lady with broken English and calling her nasty names because the worker didn’t understand what the customer wanted.  Also put soy food in the bowl when not asked for. The food also slowly got more disgusting each time.  I’m not sure if it’s because it’s old or has not been taken care of properly.  They also keep your stamp card when it’s half way full and say that we need a new one.  Customer service used to be decent. Now I refuse to go there.  Just a bunch of angry people who slop food in your bowl.</text>

<Review>Extremely inconsistent! We're on vacation in the area and are retired Air Force and are fortunate enough to be able to use the base. Great commissary, bowling alley etc. For 2 days, we went on base and had take out here because our love of poki. Both times, the bowls were inconsistent. Rice, base, 2 proteins or 3 and toppings. Both times, different people, different results. We paid a lot of money for a lot of nothing. Too much rice, not enough poki. We were here last year and ate here once. I'm sure it's the last time we'll be back to California, much less eating here!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I really enjoyed this place. I've never been here before tonight so I wasn't sure what I was walking into. It's similar to a chipotle of sushi type bowls. I got rice, shrimp tempura, krab, kimchi shrimp, seaweed salad, edamame, and spicy mayo. 10/10 would have again.</review>

It's a chain similar to panda but focused on rice bowls. The variety of meats is pretty decent and I haven't left unsatisfied yet. I don't eat high quality Japanese regularly so the food tastes pretty good. It's quick, not too pricey and the staff are always nice.</Review>

Not sure why the name says Hibachi when they don’t do Hibachi. The employee looked at me like I was crazy when asked her if they were going to cook my food on the Hibachi grill. The food is good though. It’s like an Asian food version of Chipotle.< /text>

It's got a decent selection of poke, and interestingly enough cooked fish too. Don't know much about sauces though, the selection is scant.</Text>

<text>First experience here was very unpleasant. The price was bad. After living in Japan the last two years, to call this Japanese food would be like calling a dog a cat. Was not tasty, nothing about it measured up to expectations. I would like to add I also got food poisoning. Save your money and save your toilet.</text><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
went to hibachi-san and they had no food. they said no white rice, no salmon, no tuna. only 3 kinds proteins were available, all of the spicy variety. so i left. Then the worker from hibachi-sab ran across the parking lot with a metal container (no lid) to anotjer reasturant, went into the back of this other reasturant, got cooked white rice, and ran back across the parking lot to sell the rice as their own.<//Review>

Food was alright. Almost didnt taste as fresh as real Japanese food or sushi. Worst part was i was stuck there for an hour cause their internet was down or something and i couldnt pay, but instead of warning me before i ordered my food they prepared it then told me so i had to wait. Did this to a number of customers behind me. Really bad on them.</text>

<text>It should be illegal to sell a bowl full of rice with 2 strips of spam, a spoon full of corn and pinch seaweed with some water for 11 dollars lol. But it's not. I gotta say it's the healthiest thing I can find in 20 area of camp Pendleton in a hurry but it's over priced, their tea is nasty, and they talk over your food.< /text><gmap_id>0x80dc6f9692227587:0xd3e2e457af9096cc</gmap_id><Rating>2< /Rating>< date>

We ordered a customized cake 🎂for my son's birthday and they did a fabulous job with it. The cake was moist, light and flavorful in taste (🥭mango flavor) and also looked equally fantastic. We received tons of compliments on the cake 🍰🎂and they surely made our little boy's day. I definitely recommend this place to all.😀👍</review>

<name>shwe Aj< /name><user>111142189554954458264< /user><Review>Ordered a butter scotch birthday cake for my daughter’s birthday and they did a fantastic job on the taste as well as the design of the cake. They usually have a book for selecting the cake and flavors, but I wanted a cocomelon cake that wasn’t on their book list. I just shared a picture with them and they made a exact replica of it. Loved the taste of it as well. It was a perfect Indian tasting cake with not much sugar in it.

They also made 20 assorted cupcakes of vanilla and chocolate with diff color and designed toppings. Id definitely recommend them.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< date>

<Review>Cakes & Bakes have good variety of cakes & pastries. I have tried almost all the flavors but Mango & Double Chocolate are my favorite pastries. Pastries are soft, fluffy & as sweet as we Desi people like. They offer eggless options as well. They also serve Samosay, Pani Puri, Bhel Puri, Vada Pav, Pav Bhaji & different types of Chaat.
I heard about some famous bakeries but still not sure if cakes have some ingredients which are Haraam. So I prefer to avoid them until I get correct info.
At Cakes & Bakes I asked the person at the counter about Halal but he didn't know what I mean. So I inquired if they use wine or any ingredients come from animal source & he replied in NO. But still I strongly recommend to confirm your own first if cautious about Halal thing.< /Review><time>1615262902114< /time><username>Saniya Khan< /username>< pictures>

<text>Cute little family Indian Cafe. Next to Smart and final. The have some tables to eat in and huge pitchers of water on every table. You wont be thirsty here. They have samosas and baked goods. The chicken samosa was great and crispy as well as the veggie one and the 2 cakes that I tried were fluffy sweet goodness. I just wish they would have explained the dishes more or give suggestions to the non-Indian customers.< /text>< pictures>

<review>I would have given negative stars if there is an option.
They give you the wrong orders specially with cakes and when we ask them to replace it with the correct order rude with the customers.
We should sue the business like this and close it.
If anyone is planning to order a cake for a party at your home never go to this place.</review>< pictures>

Good collection of Indian pastries. I ordered pineapple, mango, butterscotch and chocolate. I actually liked all of the flavors. I just felt a bit pricy but once in a while you can get these. They also have eggless pastries options. Definitely worth ordering if any family member doesn’t eat egg. Would definitely go there again to try their other flavors.< /Review>

Giving 1 star rating is also very high but I don’t have any option to give 0 rating. Very bad service and behavior with customer. Mixed veg and nog veg items. when I asked to separate them to different box.. just said you can eat them that’s okay and he left, didn’t even responded in a good manner. He even lied about the item is finished.. by the next minute he brought full tray out to display.. I was like seriously...! long wait times and crazy bad service, better to quit these kind of restaurants.< /Review>

We always make cakes by order we won' t make and keep. 2 Lb cakes we make it on the same day. May be you bought an eggless cake which is different from regular cake with egg. Eggless cake is bit dry compared to the cake with egg. Let me know the date you ordered and I will check with the staff and get you replacement  next time with cost on us. About service I will fix to my best and will not repeat if it didnt go with youre expectation. All employees are now under lot of pressure and tensed because of Covid. Hope you can understand .

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>I ordered an choco anniversary cake from them and they behaved very professionally and charged 87$ including tax for a 8inch cake. We were very happy that we will celebrate the day with the awesome cake but unfortunately the quality of the cake was worst I have seen, fondants were used were stuffed with sugar and almost as hard as steel. People were struggling to cut the cake. They could not even design the cake as it was discussed during order. All in all it was a total waste of my money, a 80$ cake when you charge you should show some quality.  I will never buy from them and tell my friends too. A costco cake of 13$ is way better than the 80$ cake they charged from me. Shame. Wish google had a negative rating.< /text>< Name>

Items are tasty but pricier. The cakes are good but pricier.

The biggest turn off is the staff. Very arrogant and do not treat customers properly. They dont treat everyone the same. Especially the guy at counter with beard - he treats customer as if like he is making some favor by taking your order.

My advice: Be good to people  and treat every customer the same.  Reduce the price of items slightly. Since there is competition do not try to take advantage.<//review>

They hv good chaat & awesome chicken tikka burger which is what we have always ordered. Lask week I ordered chicken & Paneer tikka burger for our small party & was very excited abt it 'cos my veg friends had not tasted it, to my shock there was no Paneer tikka in the burger it was grated paneer, cooked soft with some mint chutney i ate a quarter & threw the rest, it had no flavor, very bland, b'cos i was anticipating tikka, it tasted like a disaster. My veg guests were polite enough to eat it with some spicy sauce, i managed to offer. The picture of Paneer TIKKA burger in their website is misleading, it shows paneer tikka inside the burger, which is fooling customers.</Text>

< Review>
After longtime i liked the food in a restaurant. Its more of a bakery plus appetizers and dosas. I went their small store before but didn't like the food that time but im glad i ordered and the samosa chaat i ordered was just mouth watering. Although i was lil unhappy that samosa chaat only had one samosa, for 6 dollar i can expect 2 samosas in chaat but the flawless taste made me extremely content with my order. Plus their chai is really good but the cup is too small.
Suggestions: for 6 dollars please add 2 samosas in chaat
For chai atleast please provide medium cup< /Review>

<review>These guys have expanded a month ago, the place is huge now, cakes both eggless and with eggs are awesome, must visit for all indian chats and sweets. The chicken is not Halal. They also take payments with tap and pay devices, apple or android. They also take custom orders for parties and events.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXJdmw6CeVcQAbYeu_vRWcYVKoqKVd8_0Pmmy9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9xWRx13bhIb_X4d4NFMXy3i7HVku5RqCTvyXa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeXXJzNA7irZQI5Zk1jgYaroCwxNVh98afia5S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKUGIh_tWk7NUJjr9f37iAVcgw-Eo3_532DILz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>“Decent Place to have some typical Indian quick bites. Small place, the guy at the counter was good with nice gestures. You can get many types of Indian snakes, especially chai, samosa, some varieties of puffs and many other fast foods too. Not to forget panipuri here is the best that you can get in whole Fremont maybe in the entire Bay Area. Loved thei panipuri which was served in typical Hyderabadi style. The guy at the panipuri stall was good too. Will definitely visit again for sure. Panipuri available only on Weekends ......</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy7Rc-FIpdxjezCh9cNr5sGiU40ZMLCRq2XHHN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr6Oc5FTyk0PvrhpZN5iQ9DSmDUkUYV_IZr0cN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8gZCIzMA8SFL0S90SsAiTE4HiO0w724w1q-2V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808fc0904cf1d521:0x37de583b775e28cf<//GmapID></record>

<Review>I love this place, everytime I've been here It was a great experience. At store I love their egg puff, corn chat and not to forget vadapav. After few visits we decided to give my daughter's first birthday cake order to them and I am glad I took that decision. Attached our cake picture and the flavors were simply great. My favorite was guava, yummm!!! Look forward for more cakes from cakes and bakes :)< /Review>< gmap_id>

Really Bad restaurant with horrible food, and terrible response.

First Experience: (Pick up) : The chat items were totally terrible, and Dahi papdi chat is so soggy. Bland in taste.

Second Experience (Online Order) : The quality is even worse, added to the misery, the instructions weren't followed for the cake and delivered a wrong item.

When I call to inquire, the response was very very rude and inhumane. Really a terrible place to even think about it.< /review>

<Review>Great cakes at reasonable price. We ordered a cake for the sweet 16 occasion  from them. 2 layered. We choose an intricate flower design. Filling was black forest. We were a bit tensed since it's the first time and not much experience with this shop then, but when it was delivered it looked beautiful. When we cut the cake it tasted fantastic. There was not much cake left at the end of the party.

Great cake, baker Vinod fulfilled his promise 100%.

Thank u Vinod and Cakes and Bakes

I took samosas they were half cooked and stuffing was a bit salty. The past few times after lockdown I have taken parcel every time I am disappointed.

I used to like this place Mirchi bajji but now the quality has gone down a lot, I hope they realize this and improve it soon.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>In Short! I had a worst experience today. I m a regular customer to this place and I like it, just because it’s the only place where I get Indian snacks. But this time I had a very bad service as I had  to cancel my order after waiting for almost 30 mins. We ordered some snacks and Tea. We finished the snacks and were waiting for T. The guy was busy in taking new orders with the customers. I did follow up on my order of Tea but no response for a while. When I finally asked him to cancel my order, he didn’t even ask me why & what happen. He Just said “wait I will cancel as I’m taking order with the customer”. I said u expect me to wait for canceling my order also. He canceled part of my order but he didn’t even apologize us for waiting 25 mins. It doesn’t matter to them but they just lost us, We decided not to go there anymore.</Review>< pics>

Doesn't feel like other high end bakeries, but does cost you as much. I have been to some other Indian bakeries that are much more creative in taste and presentation.
Serious competition is needed that have equal or better taste, gives priority to presentation both for the product and the location, and some friendly service.</text>< pictures>

<Text>I used to wait here for a while every week when my son had a work related injury, and was seeing urgent care next door.

Now I miss the excuse.

I would urge my son to get a sweet so I could have a bit -- their cakes are fantastic, and so are the Indian sweets. But my standard lunch is the dahi papri and masala chai, both so good, and more than I really need for lunch.

Smart & Final should be glad these fellows are here -- I look at their flier to see if I have a reason to go there and to Namaste (other S Asian grocers are closer to home).

The decor isn't much but they're working on it. They just doubled their space a while ago and it's open and clean and bright -- what more do you need? (Besides good food!)

But it is a bit of a work in progress and very informal.< /Text>< resp>

Nice place to grab quick bite. Nice cakes, no too sweet. Indian snacks are great as well. Service can be little faster though, I wish. It has limited seating but it's wasn't that crowded when I visited on Sunday. Overall nice experience.</Review>

<review>Totally irresponsible people. Do not ever trust their word.We went to this store to get Samosas for guests.These people said Samosas are over and they are making it fresh and would take 15-20 mins of time.We believed it and rushed to nearby places to tick off some other tasks off our list.We again drove back after 25 mins to this shop.On asking about samosas this fellow tells us sorry we are no longer making samosas. What the hell is this? Then why did you even tell us that there is 15-20 mins waiting time.We wouldn't have come to this store then.Hopeless experience ever.Utterly unprofessional.< /review>< gmap_id>

<review>The place is spotless. I tried the onion samosa and three different types of cakes during the afternoon tea. I will definitely come back for the burger and wrap next. It all looks good. Enjoy.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>Ordered a Birthday over phone, no customization no fan fare, simple choc cake with simplest birthday message. I was told $48 for the cake, I accepted the price and turned up on the day of pick up. Cake was available, but the guy says $55, when I presented my credit card for payment, he asked whether I have cash, he said we could save tax. I was ready to pay but it was still $55, going by California taxes - even going by the original price 48+4 should have been 52 dollars, don’t know how they added 3 to it and paying cash I should be paying only 48 and nothing more. Now when I asked why isn’t it 48 dollars, he started negotiating, first down was 53 and then 50. I absolutely hated the experience - only Indian businesses can do this to you, absolutely shameless!!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

They also always have some cakes in stock if you need to get one in the last minute.

Their chaat items are decent as well - but I would go here for the cake and not for the snacks and chaat. They also have tables to sit and have the chaat.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fc0904cf1d521:0x37de583b775e28cf< /GmapID></record>

<text>Good for quick bites and Indian style cakes. I have tried chhole bhature, poori sabzi and Dosa over here and found the taste to be good.
Cakes are good and fresh but it's recommended to order in advance. They also provide eggless cakes at additional nominal charges.</text>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><text>The people in this restaurant are not at all bothered about customer satisfaction. I have ordered through UberEats and the ordered delivered was not the right order. Though I have ordered through UberEats, I still had the patience to go to the restaurant and asked them to replace the order. There was one person at the front desk who was very impolite and impatient. When I explained him the exact scenario, he was like "It is not my problem, we have given the right order and it is the driver who has done the mistake". I have tried to explain it clearly that the least you could do for customer satisfaction is replace the order as the fault is with the Restaurants brand. He was becoming even more impatient and said "Wait for the driver to arrive and take your order" . I even expalined that the food would become cold and It might not be worth the wait. After explaining so much, he still held his ground saying that we have counts and the owner would not be happy if the count does not match. Finally, I had to give up and even left my order at his desk. "This is the first time I am writing a negative review for a restaurant and this could explain the service of the people working there." I hope my experience helps people looking for better customer service.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<pics>None< /pics><review>This place is good for indain bakery items. Had chicken pakoda, punugulu, chicken puff and badam milk. All items were super flavorful and tasty. From my previous visits i recommend kurma parantha and chai too. Must visit for pani puri lovers and great indian style pastries. Onion samosas are not authentic, i felt they had the same consistency as the frozen ones we get in indain stores. Also, i didn't like the murukulu i bought, too hard and tasteless.</review>< user_id>

<review>I dont know who is giving this place 4 or 5 star. Everytime i have been to this place i have seen an arrogant person and an expensive costing of everything. And extremely bad customer service. This has happened multiple times, when the cashier saw us with 2 kids, intentionally making us wait as long as he can. He made sure, he does all his errands and other tasks before talking to us. We were waiting for 30 mins with younger ones. When i confronted the person, he had no response, but to lie and be non-courteous and a don't care attitude.

This place has been minting money off of Indians. And not these guys are in a 7th heaven and they are favoring each other.
There is better quality cakes and food at a cheaper and way better service else where.<//review></record></dataset><record>

[Update 27-Mar-19]
One of the person at the front desk was quite rude. The usual people working at this place are usually very kind and pleasant to speak to. Does not seem fair that I should reduce the rating of the place due to this one person, but if the cafe is listening, please at least be don’t be rude to customers. This interaction has dropped by rating by one star. If this was my only interaction, I would have given it 1 star.

—-

Great food here and service too. The serve unique food which is not served elsewhere; with really good quality and taste.

Would highly recommend this place.

Some things we have noticed:
- The food is almost always fresh
- The food is not bland unlike other places

Some of our favorites are: dil pasand, mirchi bhajji, aloo and panner tikka burger, paani puri. idli sambar (really good sambar)

Only downside is that they do not have high-chairs for small kids.</review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Was able to fill out forms in advance online. Received communication of preparation when coming into office for child. Upon arrival, sent text to announce, received almost immediate response to come in, we both got temperature scanned and given hand sanitizer. Staff was super helpful, dental hygienist was friendly, Dr. Lani super kind, inviting and provided a wealth of info that will prove to be beneficial for both child and I. Scheduling next appointment was easy and we were sent off with a 'goody bag'. Pleasant experience all around.<//review>< username>

My 3 year old son had the best time here. They really made him feel comfortable and engaged in conversation with him so he would trust them. They were also patient with him. They made the dental experience easy for me as a parent & fun for my 3 year old.</text>

Dr. Yvonne is AMAZING!!!! My daughter is a tough one and wouldn’t even let the last dentist take X-rays. Not only did Dr. Yvonne and her team get the X-rays done easily, but Dr. Yvonne filled two cavities and my daughter was completely at ease and literally didn’t feel a thing. The joke for the rest of the day was whether or not Dr. Yvonne actually did the poke and the drill. She’s incredibly patient and skilled - can’t recommend enough!<//review>

My child’s first dental appointment couldn’t have been a more pleasant one thanks to Dr. Lani Chang and the staff at Irvine Children’s Dentistry! The office was impeccably clean and my almost two year old had a great time watching Cocomelon on the screen during the short wait. Once Dr. Chang came in she took her time to get acquainted with my child before doing anything. She had amazing bedside manners and was great interacting and engaging my toddler in conversation to get her at ease. The entire initial checkup went smoothly and my child walked out with balloons, goodie bag, stickers and a big smile on her face. I would highly recommend Dr. Lani Chang!< /review>

<review>We’ve met with 3 of the dentists so far with our now 4 and 1 year old kids. They have all been so sweet and know how to talk with kids. They are so patient and complete the exams in a quick fashion. We’ve received a lot of great tips as parents on how to best care for our children’s teeth. They’ve also been so professional and have taken excellent cleaning and screening measures during COVID. The kids love the balloon and stickers at the end too and always end up leaving happy. Thank you!<//review>< Time>

We absolutely love the staff at Irvine Children’s Dentistry. Dr. Lani is THE BEST, but really all of the staff is. I can’t wait until Covid is behind us so we can get all the little special touches back like the toys in waiting room, treasure box, and see all of the staff’s smiling faces. We love it here!!!< /Review>

< Review>
As a fist time mommy my daughter Catalina was having issues breast feeding when she was born. I decided to seek help from a lactation consultant that later suggested I have my daughter evaluated for a lip and tounge tie. We were referred to Irvine Children's Dentistry where Dr. Yvonne evaluated my 6 week-old baby. She was very gentle with her and diagnosed her with both a lip and tongue tie. Dr. Yvonne advised for her to have a frenectomy in order for my baby to properly latch and nurse. She was very thorough in explaining the procedure, after care exercises and ensuring that Catalina was comfortable before, during and after the procedure. All of our questions were answered (and yes I had A LOT of questions!). I was very nervous going into her appointment but after speaking to Dr. Yvonne I knew my daughter was in good hands. From the moment we were warmly greeted by Jose at front desk, we knew that we had made the right choice coming here. Thank you to all of the wonderful staff for being so supportive and caring for my daughter. My daughter has made amazing improvement in nursing after her frenectomy. As a mother, I highly recommend Irvine Children's Dentistry to all parents.<//Review>

<rate>2</rate><Text>I had a very disappointing experience with Dr. Lani performing a cavity filling on my 8 year old.  He has had 2 cavities filled in the past with different dentists and did just fine both times.  But with Dr. Lani, he was in a lot of pain for most of the procedure even with nitrous oxide.  He screamed out in pain and was near crying at one point. Dr. Lani kept going, just telling him to breathe the air.  I felt the difference from prior experiences was the time they allow him to breathe the nitrous oxide before starting the procedure.  Usually, he is allowed some time to breathe the gas and the dentist ensures he is relaxed prior to starting.  Dr. Lani, however, just jumped right in and started the procedure almost immediately.  I definitely got the impression she was rushed and didn't seem to care about my son's discomfort.  He never had a fear of the dentist before but now he says he hates the dentist and never wants to go back.< /Text>< pics>

Also, this is the first practice at which he has tolerated x-rays at all. We had some sealants crack at our last practice. So time will tell if this dentist's sealants are any better. But she certainly was confident (dextrous and experienced). Very happy so far!</Text></record></dataset><record>

I wish Irvine Children’s Dentistry took adults. My 4 year old had 2 fillings done today and he rocked it. The dentist’s office called us yesterday to talk about the procedure and confirm our appointment time. Basically they were calming me down over my kid having to use nitrous for the procedure. They even took notes on what terms I used (laughing gas instead of nitrous oxide) to explain to my child so we were all on the same page. He walked in today fearless and excited. He walked out with a balloon, toy, and sticker while giving high fives to everyone. They made the entire experience a pleasurable one for all of us. Please rethink your policy on seeing adults because I really would love to be one of your patients. I couldn’t possibly give the dentists and staff enough praise for all they do. Dr Lani was awesome and thorough. My kids look forward to seeing you guys in 6 months. I’ve never heard a parent say their kids are excited to see the dentist?  I am so lucky I found this office and we will be forever patients. Thank you. Thank you.<//text>

<Review>This practice is the BEST of the BEST! The entire staff from the dentists to the dental assistants are superb. They really go out of their way to make their little patients feel at ease and are huge on preventative dentistry rather than ripping parents off with evasive treatments. Their bedside manner is above standard and they are like family to my boys. We drive from Corona to come here and have been patients for over 16 years. This practice is completed trustworthy and do excellent dental work!</Review>< user>

The very best pediatric dental practice in Orange County.  I am always impressed with everyone from the front office staff to the hygienists. The front office staff are always super nice and the hygienists make my children feel comfortable.  All the Dr's have great chair side manner and know how to interact with kids so they don’t feel like they are being talked down to, In particular, Dr. Yvonne is a favorite because my children don’t like to be treated like babies. She speaks to and treats them like they are smart children. They continue to have a positive experience on every visIt.</Review>

Excellent experience from the front office staff, to back staff of dental assistants, dental hygienist and Dr's. Everyone was courteous and professional. My 4 y.o. was a little apprehensive at first, but the hygienist made her at ease very quickly with her calm and reassuring words. Great experience and I definitely recommend!</review>

The dentists here are professional, thorough, and top notch. They also do well with connecting with each of their patients and assuring the children have a good experience. We have been coming here for 6 years and have always had a positive experience from the front office to the hygienists to the dentists. They also have an orthodontist here so our care continues to be complete.  The nautical theme here is calming, the "above chair" videos that children can choose for longer procedures keeps them occupied, and waiting room is organized and supplied with toys and quiet video games.  Most important to us though is the care, which we are absolutely satisfied and happy with. The dentists are all excellent and I feel each one had solid integrity and excel in their profession.  Thank you!< /text>

My son had gone through a traumatic experience with our previous dentist. Dr. Lani Chang went out of we way to make sure my son was comfortable and she was so patient with him and his fears. All the women in the office are so kind.<//review>

< Review>
My boys have been coming here for almost 3yrs. The staff is super friendly and do a great job with the kids, by making them feel special. My youngest overcame his fear of the "tooth Dr" after his second visit. The staff made him feel very comfortable at this dentistry.

My oldest is in the process of getting a device in his mouth, I regret not remembering the proper name for it, so forgive me. The device is to bring his jaw forward, that will eventually aligne his mouth together. My son ran out of seprators (small ruberbands used to space out the teeth, that will allow the device to go on smoothly) and used my elastics in substitute of the separators.

Nice try being creative, but epic fail. So, don't try substituting anything for the sperators as I did. The elastics held on at first but because the we're clear it blended with his teeth and gum and was hard to find. The elastic used as a separator slipped all the way down to the button of his gum and wedged tightly between both the gum and tooth. The lady that attended my son listed to his complaints. Although it was impossible to find the elastic, she managed to fish it out. Literally speaking, with her spesias orthodontist tools .

Thank you, Sandra RDA in Irvine, CA! If you for being so dedicated to the children and for listening to them. I can't imagine what pain or infection he could have gotten if the band was left in his tooth. Millions of thank yous!!!!

You'll need to give this place an opportunity, your children won't regret it!<//Review>

<GmapID>0x80dcddd90daf11b5:0x303b3c210968082a<//GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Vanessa Fandino< /Name><text>My son, Enzo, is almost 3 years old and I took him to get a check-up with Dr. Clara Lee. My son really enjoys coming here because they have lots of toys and video games in the lobby. We were escorted to a small room where Enzo was able to choose a DVD to watch while Dr. Lee counted his teeth. We laid him down across dad's lap and he did cry a bit because he was scared, but Dr. Lee was very gentle and quick. Enzo got to pick a sticker, a small toy, a balloon, toothbrush and floss as parting gifts, which made him very happy. He wanted to stay in the lobby longer and play with all the toys!

I really love the marine theme they have in the office and the staff is always so friendly. I had received a reminder email and a phone call to confirm our appointment. They also called us to make sure our insurance was updated before we came into the office - which was very thorough of them. Dr. Lee was very good at giving us ideas on how to care for Enzo's teeth and answered all our questions without making us feel rushed.

Also, if you haven't taken your baby to see a dentist yet, you can get a free initial check-up if they are under 3 years old! I would definitely recommend this dentistry!< /text>< rating>

<review>Great Facility for Family Fun and for Individualized workouts!
No matter the weather the C.V. Starr is a place to be physically active! This place has a two giant swimming pools, one for leisure, and one for competitive/exercise. It also has a water slide and a lazy river! & that's not all! It also has three different workout rooms two for classes (like zumba, yoga, spin, etc...) and another one large room containing exercise machines and other equipment. This place also has two more event rooms that can be combined for large meetings or parties or can be separated for smaller parties like birthday parties. Each room when used for birthday parties comes with free entrance to swimming for your guests! Oh and I almost forgot, the C.V. Starr also has creative classes like; tapestry arts, robotics, digital media fun, gymnastics, music, and much more...
Individuals looking for a workout, to learn something new, to connect with others, or for aquatic fun will love the C.V. Starr community Center.</review>< Pics>

What a great community center. Nice indoor pool facility with a competition pool, a water slide, lazy river, and play pool. They have a workout room, space for aerobic classes, and more great amenities.  This is definitely something that i would enjoy in our community.<//Text>

This is easily the best indoor pool facility and community center in northern California. With a lazy river , awesome slides and many diving boards among several pools and spas , this little secret in the middle of Fort Bragg California is not to be missed . Not only do they have top notch water activities available but they also have a skate/bike park , bocce ball , horse shoe pits and volleyball courts as well as showers , lockers , ample parking and very reasonable rates.</text>

<Text>What an amazing facility for this rather isolated oceanfront community. I was at a meeting here for four hours and watched the community pool go through at least 3 groups of citizens - swim lessons for kids, aerobics for the elderly, lap swim - then at 1:00 the water slides opened. What a great place.</Text><gmap_id>0x8081caace9bac623:0x810acdf95b883386<//gmap_id>< response>

Nice pool, but the staff needs to learn how to work the ventilation system, it was so humid and hot. I was there for a swim meet with over 300 swimmers and their parents and support staff. The pipes were dripping on us it was so humid.< /text>

If it wasn't for the fact that C.V. Starr grew up in Fort Bragg, I don't know that this place would ever exist. A huge heated swimming pool with areas for kids and adults, workout rooms, weight lifting. And it's affordable for just about anyone. There's also a skatepark out back, and a dog park in front. One of the true gems of Fort Bragg.
They also offer very affordable swim classes for kids, and room rentals with pool access for birthday parties, etc.< /Text>

We're traveling around the world and we have been welcomed to take a shower in most part of the community centres where we're passing by. This is a basic human need and I believe that all communities should be able to provide this service to travellers who are visiting their cities and countries.<//review>< user_name>

♿ Really love this place. They need more payment options though. I paid $80 a month for my son and I. If I paid for just myself, it would be $30 because I'm disabled. I think it should be a bit cheaper.<//review>

<Review>Had a very rude employee threatened a group of 30 for a 5 year old's birthday party, in the form of charging us more on our credit card if we didn't hurry up and get out of there because they were closing. After when I got dressed along with the rest of our family, I walked over to the the desk, to speak to her. I expressed the need for a better way to treat people, and in a very indignant tone, she said "would you like to leave a letter for my boss" I told her that she should take her job more seriously, especially when people are paying, and threatening people is not the right way to get someone to hurry up. She just looked at me rolled her eyes and smacked her mouth like if I was her parent. Afterwards one of the lifeguards came over and shook my hand and said "I'm glad you told her off, because she is a 'blank' to everyone here"<//Review>< date>

<review>I am on a roadtrip and usually go to Community Centers for a shower. I Think, charging 7$ is a bit pricey for just taking a shower. E.g. lincoln City charges 2.75$. Sorry, that why i only give 2 of 5!< /review>< pics>

Parking maybe a bit challenging in holidays, but easy in weekdays. There is wide open grass area with picnic tables, and also trails for walking. The trail goes down to beach is pretty short, our 3 years old toddler handled it without problem. Tide pool area is very enjoyable. Public restroom near golf car return area is still available in COVID lockdown time, which a great plus for the little ones.<//Text>

Pretty cool coast to hike at. Very busy though, so the tide pools and picnic type areas may be very busy. There are a couple spots to sit high up on the cliffs but you may need to get there early or late since they're so limited.
A lot of people ignore the signs and bring their dogs on the trails, so beware if you are allergic.< /text>

Beautifully kept "park" with picnic tables along the edges within the golf course. Great place for picnics or to enjoy the weather. Be warned, there isn't much shade though.
The main paved path in the park takes you on a loop. It does connect to several trails that lead down to the ocean. For steep switchbacks, take the dirt trail that starts on the far side (ocean side) of the paved path. For an easier hike down, a wide dirt path extends toward the golf course (away from the clubhouse) with a smaller path coming off of it. You can also follow the wide path around the golf course-a couple other hiking trails extend down to the rocky beach from this. Some are more difficult than others.<//review>

This is not even a park is just a patch of grass in the center court area of the golf course where the golf cars pass thru. There is a nice size gazebo to one side and lots of grass. that's about it. Not worth calling ti a park.<//Review>

Beautiful park with a really amazing view of the Pacific ocean and if it's a clear day you can even see Catalina island on the horizon. There's a hiking trail that takes you down the cliff to the beach.<//Text>

I used to live in North Hollywood and I discovered this bike shop so happy I did I now drive from Sherman oaks where I live just to come to this bike shop. Whenever I fill the Air on my tires it seems to go flat in a couple of days.  I bring it here to be serviced and my bike been perfect for months still. Great prices with quality service by a friendly knowledgeable owner.< /text>

Awesome bike shop! These guys are really knowledgeable and helped me figure out a few things about my bike. Repair/tune services here are very fair and I don’t feel like they were trying to sell me anything more than I needed.< /review>

I live around the corner from this shop and generally the store owners are pretty nice in our area.  Sadly, these guys are not one of them.  EVERY time I have asked a question to these guys I get push back and an attitude of "You're bothering me." I have asked in the past about kids bikes, helmets, tires, and purchasing bikes. If you know your bikes and needs they might treat you differently but if you are looking for someplace to help you, maybe consider going to another bike shop. This place may sell good bike but the customer service really leaves something to be desired.< /review>

<Review>I just stopped by to see if I could possibly purchase new handlebars because my neck was killing me on my Cannondale road bike.
Craig took the time and explained to me what he could see and with a couple tweaks, before I knew it, he adjusted my bike right in front of me- on the spot!

It happened so fast,  it was almost like he took a magic wand and with the flick of his hand, my bike magically appeared with a perfect custom fit.
I took it on a spin to test it and finally my neck didn’t hurt!
I am a very happy customer!!!!!
Thanks to Craig and NoHo Cycles !< /Review>< Pics>

Originally went to a bike shop in Burbank to figure out why my front rotor on my BRAND NEW mtb was grinding. They wanted to charge me for a brake bleed, a new front rotor, and new brake pads. I came to NoHo Cycles and all they told me was my rotor was a little bent. They charged me $10 to realign the rotor + $10 to give the bike a once over. $20!!!! I’ll definitely be coming back!!!! Thanks guys, you are awesome!</review>< rate>

<review>I can't say anything for or against the work, but everything else is a frustrating. They're trying to keep up with demand but as result they won't answer the phone, no email or online communication to be found. Estimated turnaround is all over the place depending on who you talk to. I hope they get their customer service and attitudes fixed because this demand won't last forever. I'll be going somewhere else.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c295f4b1fc3503:0xe60f7c75866b3dbd< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was given major attitude when I asked to look at a product.  When I asked the individual why he was speaking to me like that,  he replied,  and I quote "Do you have money,  cause you look homeless to me?" Should you buy from this store,  Never! Should the owner consider retirement since he has lost touch, yes! Let's kill off the dinosaurs a 2nd time.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Craig was awesome! My bike got boosted not too long ago and I wanted to get an easy replacement. Craig answered my questions, and gave me a few pointers. I left with a new Pure Fix, a new Kryptonite lock, and a great deal of advice. He made sure my bike was tuned up well. All around a great one stop shop. I ended up spending around 254$. I bought a demo bike on sale. It was a great experience and I will be bringing my bike in if I ever need too. SHOP SMALL, and be sure to stop in. Thanks Craig!<//Text><rating>5<//rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

Just took it in again after leaving it non-operational a while in the Winter, and the price is still the same, which is at least 1/3 less than most shops charge. This is a bike mechanic, not a pushy bike sales dealership. Definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I've gone to NoHo Cycle twice now for tune-ups.  The first time as a random walk in, the second time calling ahead to see if they were busy or not.  Both times they were friendly and curious, they didn't try and upscale me or push accessories.  They asked what I wanted done and my riding style, fixed the bike and gave me some suggestions for home care.

I will definitely be going back.  And they have home pick up!  I've never heard of a bike shop doing that before.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
This is a great new shop and Valley commuters should all take note. I judge bike shops on three criteria:

1) Do they sell parts for the everyday cyclist?
2) Do they shamefully hide their mechanics in the back?
3) Are they open for commuting hours in a strategic cycling location?

These guys pass the test with flying colors. They helped me out of a major pinch when some idiot stole my chain last week. They even straightened my derailler hanger free of charge. This shop and Coco's Variety are all you really need unless yer a jerk in spandex!</Review>

(Translated by Google) Excellent attention. They raised my bicycle seat and didn't charge me a dollar.
Recommendable.

<Text>Let us tosses is a really good place to get your own type of salads. The manager there is really nice and extremely helpful. I was able to get a chicken salad by adding in fruit and vegetables and some cheese and it was really tasty. Everyone at that restaurant seemed to be very friendly and I like the ambience as well.<//Text>< userid>

<review>The location is a bit far out of nowhere but we are glad that we made it. Freshly tossed salad with grommet dressing even the pita bread is amazing. steak and barbecue wraps are robust with flavor. My salad  comes with a big serving that's enough for two people. House cilantro dressing is spectacular Chipotle dressing is spicy however with tons of flavor.<//review>< pics>

Great place for healthy, fresh food!  The portions are huge and everyone loved the food they ordered.  My friends ordered the Sizzling Stripper with shrimp/chicken and a baked potato with cheddar/chicken/broccoli.  I got the Strawberry Sweetness and the cheese griller.  Staff are very friendly and attentive.  I'm definitely come back!<//review>

I ordered the Apple Nut Cruncher, a crisp blend of Romaine, tiny walnut chunks, small apple bites, raisins & bleu cheese crumbles, to which I added  (but which was by no means necessary to make this a satisfying meal) grilled chicken with their house cilantro dressing on the side. My friend ordered the Strawberry Sweetness Salad, which was spring mix,  balsamic marinated strawberries, shaved parmesan, candied pecans and goat cheese, & ordered the suggested balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the side. She ordered grilled shrimp as a side protein although, again, the salad would have been a complete meal without it. Both salads were absolutely delicious and very substantial! The wait staff were both friendly and solicitious, & Tammi, the owner, brought our salads out to us herself, with a suggestion of the pesto dressing for the apple salad on our next visit, which there definitely will be! I really like salads and I loved the salads here, of which there are a plethora to try. Somehow I have a feeling that most of the other ones will be just as enjoyable as these were. Even though this establishment is not close to my home, it is well worth the drive. Kudos, Tammi and staff on a job well done and some excellent, fresh, well prepared salads in a bright, welcoming setting!</text>< Date>

<Review>The owners are always working and very nice.  I went before and during covid.  They make it work.

You order inside,  wait outside, and they bring your order outside when its done.  They dont have outdoor seating so you have to take your order to go during covid.  Before Covid they had indoor seating which I am sure they will open back up once covid has cleared.

I always get a Steak and Shrimp salad.   Its about $20.00 with a soda.< /Review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Love the salads here, the expanded selection in the menu, and the portion sizes.  When I am hungry and I don't want to mess up my diet, I come here to binge on salad with their grilled chicken and I don't add any dressing.  The quality of their vegetables is excellent and their grilled chicken has amazing flavor.  Kids loved their salad and loaded potato also.< /review>

Expensive salads but really worth every penny. Quality ingredients! The chili is also a must try! Dont forget the pita bread. I also love that they have a kid’s menu.< /text>

This place is an AMAZING find. I wish there was one closer to my home. I could go here every day because they have so many different HEALTHY choices. Healthy, delicious and FRESH food at decent prices COOKED ONCE ORDERED! That's right,  it's fresh,  so if you order any kind of meat,  make sure you give yourself enough time to wait for meat to cook which takes time. While sitting at lunch, and I usually go a couple times a week,  I've witnessed a few people get frustrated because their food takes longer than it would at McDonalds. Tammi  recommended I order ahead. So,  now I order ahead of time and my food is ready when I get there to sit down and eat. Thanks Tammi! If you can't order ahead,  bring a friend/co-worker to talk to or pull out your phone and play away while your DELICIOUS meal is being prepared.  Oh yah, I almost forgot.  The staff here is amazing and all very friendly so don't take your anger out on them because you can't be patient and wait for your food. If you have read this far, you gotta try LETTUCE TOSS IT!!</text>

I come here about once every 3 weeks and I always love what I order. Always cooked fresh after I place my order. However when I went today I tired the heater peter and was disappointed. It was overloaded with cheese that got stuck to the pan and hardened on the sourdough crust by the time I got home to eat it. Personally I don’t recommend it, but there are lots of other great choices to choose from!< /text>

This place is fantastic! The food is fresh and the prices are reasonable. The owner was super friendly and made us feel at home. She even hooked it up with a taste of her chili. Make it a point to get the Mommom's quesadilla when you eat here! It's banana & peanut buttery goodness!</review>

<Review>I went in there once a while ago and ordered two of their salads one for myself and one for my wife and their chicken was horribly cooked so dry my goodness and the salad was very average so I was like alright maybe they had a bad day and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Then went in there again maybe 3 months later and I even asked them please cook the chicken right because I told them of my last experience and again the chicken was so dry like I was chewing on plastic and an even poorer salad than the first time. Now I feel I have to let the public know of this disappointing place.< /Review>< Pictures>

Foul mouthed staff is too busy talking about personal lives to get customers the correct order. I was told that Stephanie (Manager) would call me back. No call, no response :(</Text>

<review>When it comes to lettuce this place is the best the reason why I say that is because of the variety of options you can choose to place on your salad there is refreshing quality taste with every bite of the salad this place is like Pieology or Subway blaze it pizza it is one of those restaurants where you choose the way you want your dish to be made for you since they do have a lot of options for your salad it makes it really easy to get the salad that you want but hard and difficult because of the numerous options you have to making a salad. Overall the prices aren't really that cheap they are slightly above-average but the quality that you pay for is definitely worth it this is better than a salad that you can customize at Panera Bread the cell is here get bigger portions and are definitely worth it I will definitely come back here again with friends so they can see why lettuce toss it is amazing and worth trying</review></record></dataset><record>

Great food but I dont understand why i called my order in and still showed up and had to wait 10 additional minutes. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to make a salad when theyre never busy. However the food is great if not a little pricy. Calling in is a waste of time though they kinda lack a sense of urgency< /Review>

I think it's important to keep in mind, however, that our dishes are completely fresh and made-to-order, and that's why they tend to be a tad more expensive than your average salad. Keeping that in mind, we hope you'll come visit us again soon. - Tammi Jones, Owner"}< /Response>

A stunning drive over the mountain which at a height of nearly 10,000 feet, was quite literally, breathtaking! (Seriously, don’t underestimate the effects of increased altitudes if like us you’re from a relatively low-lying country. Drinking extra water does help though.)
The drive up just demands a number of stops to take photos, and the drive down into Yosemite is no different. We managed to get through before the first serious snows of the winter, but it’s always best to check if the pass is actually open as they don’t plough the road!
Just gorgeous!<//review>

This pass from Lee Vining to Yosemite has a lot to offer. Its a long drive, but definitely worth it. During day time, you will pass various lakes and sceneries. At nighttime, you can opt to go to a stop and watch the milky way and look for shooting stars.<//text>

While returning to California one summer, our car overheated on Tioga Pass. At the pullout, we stopped to add water to the radiator and rest a little. Mom made coffee for dad, Grandpa and I walked around, while Grandma say in the hot car. Dad and I loved being out of the car smelling the fresh air with hints of pine and bear clover.< /text>

One of the highest mountain passes in California did Tioga Pass. Which is almost at 10,000 ft in elevation. It is in the Eastside of Yosemite National Park and it is on Highway 120< /review>

This is a gorgeous road. It stretches from Lee Vining to the west on a pass which goes all the way to Yosemite.  There are lakes and creeks and the best time to take photos is during fall or first snow.

The road is very windy and steep so take it slow.  During this time of year (not sure if this is all times) you will be required to stop and pay I believe $35 per car at the 12 mile mark.

The drive however for those 12 miles is worth it.  You can turn around and not pay.

I highly recommend taking this pass if you are up at the Mammoth Lakes area or Mono Lake.

We didn't have much time, so we only took a few photos, but there are so many cool places to check out.  Totally cool drive!<//text>

I'm giving this rating, because you'd think a person would have a kind heart, but not here. The amount of money these toll booths make off of the population, they couldn't even have a kind heart to a person in need..
That's such a sad senerio. Thanks for not showing any love Yosemite national park...< /review>

<review>Amazing views along the road. Inform yourself about the road conditions. It's closed between November and May because of snow. We went end of October and it already closed over 3 days because of the weather but reopened. Ask in your Motel, watch the information signs in e.g. Mariposa or call the rangers. To get to the other side of the mountsins the detour is about 7 hours when tioga pass is closed.< /review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) It’s a beautiful route, be prepared for the fact that very often we’ll stop taking photos. There are pre-arranged places for this, there is usually no need to avoid cars left on a narrow road. $ 30 is the collection cost for an average car, this is valid for 7 days, unfortunately there is no easy pass ticket.

(Original)
Gyönyörű útvonal, fel kell rá készülni, hogy igen gyakran meg fogunk állni fényképezni. Erre előre kialakított helyek vannak, általában nem kell a szűk úton otthagyott autókat kerülgetni. 30 $ a behajtási költség egy átlagos személyautónak, ez 7 napra érvényes, sajnos egyszerű áthaladó jegy nincs.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Another incredible American scenic road that connects Mono Lake to Yosemite park. You will pass by the beautiful Tenaya Lake and the ancient sequoias of Tuolumne Meadows.

I climbed the Lambert Dome and recommend it, although the walk takes twice as long as the park brochure suggests.

(Original)
Mais uma incrível estrada cênica americana, que liga o Mono Lake ao parque de Yosemite. Você vai passar ao lado do lindo Tenaya Lake e das ancestrais sequoias de Tuolumne Meadows.

Subi o Lambert Dome e recomendo, embora a caminhada leve o dobro de tempo que o folder do parque sugere.< /review>

Went here randomly after an event at Yost Theater and it definitely worth checking out! The people that helped me were super friendly. I haven’t ever had ice cream from a Michocana so I told them the flavors that I generally like and they let me try the different types and explained what they were.  Everyone was super patient and kind, I’ll definitely come back!</Text>

Worst experience ever. I’ve gone to this ice cream shop ever since I remember. Today I go and buy a large ice cream on a cup and this girl name Angela or Andy gives me like half the cup when I always go and the scoops come out of the cup. And then she gives me a dirty spoon !!!< /review>

The owner of the shop attended us and even cut his break short. We honestly just went in to look and get something for my mom but all of us ended up walking out with something delicious. He knows how to sell, he knows his business and above all he knows how to create rapport with his customers, something I appreciate. I highly recommend this specific Michoacana.

Thank you so much for the raspado and for being the only Michoacana to want to make me one.</review>

Fun flavors like queso (Mexican-style mild white cheese / queso fresco, not like Cheddar or bleu), piñón (pine nut... dyed an unfortunate colour of pink) and cinnamon rice. Clean space, friendly staff at this chain ice cream shop.</text>

<Date>1558282702757< /Date><Review>Upon entering there was confusion and we were seated at a table that was reserved for someone else. We were then asked to move - which was fine. The gentleman that asked us to move was very friendly and told us he would get us some dessert on him due to the inconvenience. This was really nice of him, and we were appreciative of that. The server that took our order and delivered our drinks and food was very unpleasant. She wasn’t very friendly and she just seemed annoyed with everything. I am not sure how many times she rolled her eyes or did a condescending press of her lips at us, but would probably not return because of it. The drinks we received were excellent and so was the food. We got the sausage fennel pizza and the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were awesome! We also received our complimentary tiramisu, which surprisingly was one of the best my friend and I had ever had. I would have given this place five stars had our server not been so rude. But, I am appreciative that the food and other friendly faces made up for that :)< /Review><username>Rebecca Gale<//username>< resp>

<Review>Atmosphere was pleasant. Staff was prompt and friendly, our server made great suggestions. I had the Spaghetti Bolognese which was flavorful, and just the right amount as well. My daughter had a steak dinner which she said was delicious. The only thing wrong, I felt was our table placement, I felt trapped in a corner, good thing was the second wall had a window that made it seem less claustrophobic.</Review>< user_id>

The food was very tasty and well portioned.
Not to pricy either.

The restaurant wasn’t too busy for a Thursday night. I can imagine it being a lot busier on the weekend with universal studio foot traffic.

Our waiter Devan was friendly and helpful with suggestions.

Look forward to returning.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>For the price I was expecting my food to have some flavor. I got chicken Alfredo, And it was just simple, no flavor at all. Especially for the price. Cost is expensive for no flavor. Their pizza however had tons of flavor. The food did come out fast though and customer service was to be expected.<//review>< pictures>

Next time you find yourself down at Universal CityWalk stop into ViVo Italian Kitchen and relax with large portions of fresh pastas. Their pizza dough is made on site daily hand-tossed with flour imported from Italy.
Sitting inside has a great atmosphere or sit outside where it's nice and comfortable and do some people watching while you eat or drink.
Maybe your just tired of walking around CityWalk shopping its a nice place to have a drink and maybe a little dessert on the patio to recharge.</Text>

<text>The chef the night we went seemed to be a bit pepper happy. All of our dishes no matter what we ordered were loaded with it. It got to the point where i just couldn't eat it anymore and this was with a limited menu. My alfredo also had very little flavor to it besides the large amount of pepper. Its honestly all I could taste.< /text><Response>None</Response>< date>

<review>Locals do not like touristy places because they are often baiting for the one time customers and they don’t care about the repeat customers.

This restaurant is great for locals.  They won’t rush you out, friendly with kids and have a kid menu (cheap) and affordable (but not wife range) wine list.

Def, I will be back with my friends when we come see movies

So refreshing to see a biz that care about locals in Uni City   Seriously we are sick of fast food stands on 2nd floor near the movie theatre.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Came to the park and left to get food at the city walk. Got lunch at the Mexican restaurant next door. That was great. Decided to stop for happy hour and it was honestly one of the best happy hours! Amazing margarita and bites! Definitely worth getting out and go back in the park for it.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Gorgeous decor and amazing service at this new establishment inside Universal Citywalk. We decided to try this place for lunch before we went to Universal Studios horror nights. We ordered:

Pomodoro - light and fresh
Chicken fettuccine - good but under-seasoned. I added salt and chili peppers to it.
Margherita pizza - thick crust with thinner middle. Delicious though!
Lasagna x 2 - we all agreed that this was the worst dish. The lasagna tasted really soggy and bland. Did not taste fresh.
A round of Peroni Italian beer - so crisp and light!

I love that they give you a sourdough boule for the table. It's so cute! For my husband's birthday, he received a complimentary tiramisu which was freshly made and a nice way to end our meal. For 4 people, we were so stuffed that it took a couple of hours of walking around in Universal Studios to feel normal again! Next time, we'll order 1 less entree.

Service was impeccable! Overall, a good experience despite the lasagna. Considering the decor, service, and food, this really is the best restaurant in Universal Citywalk. Also, lunch prices were so reasonable, I was shocked!< /review>

<Text>Mojito was very muted, seemed closer to a glass of water with lime.    This might be explained by my receipt that showed i was charged for vodka.   My drink was served without a straw so unless i wanted to chew through the mint floating in top,  I had to wait 5 mins to see the waitress.  The waitress didn't have any straws with her and had to retrieve one.   I ordered the beef medallions.  Everything was under-seasoned, perhaps to serve a more diverse tourist crowd.   There were bitter and burnt flavors between the sauce,  beef,  and broccolini.  The cracker was stale and the beef covered in dry parsley.  I stopped in because of the rating.   This is my first review to help people avoid the same mistake.< /Text><userid>105294536556228628230<//userid>< pics>

The restaurant is beautiful but the food is bland and dry and we expected more form italian . I personally took the chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. My other companion took the Mussels Marinata, it smelled BAD, it had the sea smell which isn't normal, it wasn't tasty, although the bread was crispy and good. For an Italian restaurant we expected more. They can do better , and we will be back to taste again.</Review>

This is another one of my "go tos" when I have people visiting or want to take people out for a reliably good meal.  The food is great, service is on point, and the cocktails are very drinkable.  Make a reservation and enjoy.  I have never had a bad experience.</text>

<Text>After spending a full day at Universal Studios, it seemed to be most convenient to have dinner there before making a trip back to Orange County. The service was absolutely horrendous. The host at the front of the restaurant just stared at us as if why were we there. He did not greet us, and I overheard him with the people in front of us say that he was new, and he did not know exactly what to do. Once we were seated, we sat for about 10 minutes before anyone showed up to the table to take drink orders. The waitress we had also seemed to be tending the bar adjacent to our table. Once the food was delivered, we never saw the waitress at our table again until we got our check. No one checked on our drinks, no one asked us if the food was okay....nothing. (BTW - the food was actually good, it was the service that ruined this experience). The part that caused me to fume is that we had been finished with our food for about 15 minutes, and no one came by to clear the table. I got the attention of the waitress behind the bar to let her know we were ready. She nodded her head, and then proceeded to fill drink orders for her other tables. She then had someone walk up to the bar, and she spent another 5 minutes with them taking their drink order. Waiting...Waiting...Waiting... She finally came over to the table to thank us for our patience, which by then had run out, and I asked for the bill. I went to ask her where the bathroom was, but she had already turned around and walked away. It was now a joke at this point. I don't think I've ever had that bad of service at a restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant based solely on service.<//Text><user>104582328160907730428< /user>< Date>

In the middle of Universal Studios is this great Italian-style restaurant. Beautifully done and  not at all pretentious. I'm so glad I didn't have to resort to amusement park food. Vivo Italian Kitchen would fit well in any part of LA and it's not only good because it's here.

Food was fresh, fantastic, great portion size. Cocktail with excellent. the best part was the staff. Tiffany the server was fantastic with my ten-year-old daughter and overall interesting and personable and seemed genuinely concerned that we had a nice experience. The manager was really nice too, checking on us. I highly recommend this restaurant! Super chill relaxing space,  great food.<//Text>

I came here for lunch and while the outdoor patio has a really nice atmosphere, the food leaves something to be desired. I saw squid ink pasta on the photos on yelp but didn't find it on the menu, so I asked our server if they still had it and he let me know that it was on the dinner menu but they could serve it for lunch as well. So yes, you can order anything off the dinner menu for lunch, which was nice as I liked those options a lot more.

I was so excited to find squid ink pasta near me but it was really disappointing. The noodles were not linguine as stated on the menu, but rather a thick spaghetti. The chewy texture was nice at first but honestly, after a while it was really tiring to chew. There was a good amount of large shrimp, which were cooked perfectly. But the clams were tinyyy and the mussels smelled REALLY bad. The entire dish was really quite bland and the only flavor came from the red pepper flakes.</Text>

<Review>Excellent service, amazing food, and very reasonable prices. Owners are always walking around to assure that everyone is happy, and staff is very polite. Two people could easily share one of the entrees and an appetizer as well.

My boyfriend and I shared just the lasagna entree and were extremely full at the end of the meal. :)</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Service was great. Food was okay. I've had better chicken parm at red sauce joints in Glendale, Hollywood, and Manhattan. Maybe I need to try the pastas.< /text>

I wish I could add a few more stars to this place, super food here, just a few steps away from Universal Studios down the city walk, this was my best discovery. Kudos to the Chef.</text>

<Text>Dining at Vivo was a great experience! Our waitress Neely was a great conversation and very friendly with fantastic service. The meals we ordered came out in a timely fashion and were delicious! Meals are also reasonably priced with decent portions.

After our meal we also had the pleasure of speaking with Joe the manager who was delightful and it's easy to understand why the staff are happy and the restaurant runs smoothly. Thanks to everyone at Vivo and in particular to Neely and Joe!<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>This place was very nice, the service was decent. There is just the one little thing that they gave me FOOD POISONING!!! I ordered the squid ink seafood plate which wasn't very good but was much worse when I got to taste it again at 2am that night. I will never go back there again.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

My first visit to Vivo. Came for dinner after coming out from Universal Studio. The food is good. Ordered Calamari, Squid ink linguine with seafood and Penne Ragu. The French bread is warm and crispy on other outside. Unfortunately the menu items are limited, but we ordered the 2 popular dishes and they are yummy.< /text>

< Review>
Vivo Italian Kitchen is a fine dining Italian establishment that serves mains, pastas, salads and pizza. We had a family trip there including locals and out of towners and for the most part we all enjoyed what we ordered.

My wife especially appreciated that they had gluten free pasta available which she thought was good, though the side of broccoli she ordered was a bit over cooked. (You need a little bit of crunch left in your vegetables.)

I had the Margherita Pizza made with fresh mozzarella and “grandma’s sauce” which was described by our waiter as made with more spices than regular marinara. In practice the pizza was good but I didn’t notice anything extra flavorful about the sauce and I’m wondering if our waiter didn’t have the best answer to my question. There was plenty of sauce though, which I always appreciate as many pizza joints get kind of skimpy on their pies, and the pizza was cooked perfectly with a nice, crispy, thin crust and the cheese perfectly cooked (with those little brown spots), not underdone as often happens with pizzas and fresh mozzarella.

I also enjoyed the red blend wine I ordered.

Their bread service was good too. It’s served with an olive oil / sun-dried tomato tapenade, and also with butter – Nice to get both since sometimes you don’t get butter when you want it.

There’s a good, well stocked bar and plenty to choose from on the cocktail menu as well.</Review>

Would not recommend. Dont let the atmosphere fool you. Chicken Parmigiana was horrible. Thin chicken pieces, no flavor with sliced cheese melted on top. Husbands pasta was so/so. Just really not good flavor overall. Would not eat here again:(< /Review>

We came and waited for 10mins. This angry lady came and sat another Caucasian family who came after us. When we mentioned that we have been here for 10mins. She said she does not seat people like us and should talk to the waiter if we want. I have never met a more racist restaurant treatment. I do not recommend if you are a minority or a person of color.<//Review>

They have xlnt pizza's similar to the Puck style, contemporary and with great ingredients.... arugula  tasty italian cheeses !!!  I'm a salad nut & their Arugula & Beet salad is out of this world with candied pecans!!!   Meatballs, pasta dishes all as you'd expect for a great dining experience.  The added bonus of it all is that it's at CityWalk but not crazy priced as you might think, the prices are consistent with area fine italian restaurants. Full bar with competent mixologists & a very nice wait staff, especially Danny !!!< /review>< pictures>

<text>We stay in a lot of Extended Stays due to work. This is by far the best one we’ve ever stayed in. They did an excellent job with the remodel. This is a quiet and clean location in Silicon Valley. The staff is very friendly, helpful and professional. You can get kitchen supplies from the front desk or bring your own and stay a while since there’s an almost full size fridge in the rooms as well as a new two burner stove top and new microwave. If we are working in Silicon Valley again, we will return here for our stay.</text></record></dataset><record>

Very nice looking place. Great Lobby with tables/seating for eating/watching news/coffee. Rooms have kitchenette, large fridge, microwave, stove, breakfast seating, w/ chairs. Large bathroom with shower/bath, toilet, sink, built in hairdryer. Large bed, pillows TOO soft, comfortable bedding. Recliner in room(ours didn't recline) night stand on 1 side of bed. Flat screen TV w movies for rent or you can watch cable TV. Has a linen closet wbehind a closed door- separate from the actual clothing closet which has plenty of drawers, hanging space, luggage storage a curtain to cover closet space. Kitchenette has cabinets above & below. Telephone in room. Rooms are odd on one side & even on other side- bit confusing to find at NIGHT, unless front lobby staff show you WHERE YOUR ROOM IS.<//Text>

These studio apartments are clean and remodeled.
Plenty of space in full size fridge. Cooking range and microwave available. Laundry machines are cheaply priced. Bathroom is clean, and shower curtain has a liner.
Staff is friendly. They are super customer oriented.
Shopping is nearby at Ranch 99, Great Mall & McCarthy Ranch.
Just a note: It would be great to have newer towels handed out. It's nicer and more fresh to have fluffy white towels. For a great night's rest, I recommend just a bit softer and fluffier white or creme  color blankets. Well deserved A+ and 5 stars.</Text>

Budget accommodation. Complimentary break fast available (only muffins and coffee). House keeping only once in a week. Slow internet. You need to pay for a faster connection. Very few TV channels available. All rooms are non-smoking. Kitchen utensils will be provided on demand. Best part is even drinking water is complimentary..that means you need to buy water if you want to drink more than 1/2 litre per day. they only give two pet bottles as complimentary.</Review>

<Text>Been traveling for 10 days from East Texas to Sacramento, different hotels and different brands each night.  This Extended Stay America in Milipitas, CA is by far the cleanest and nicest room we have stayed in.  The kitchen and bathroom were sparkling clean.  Also it did not smell weird or musty like many hotel rooms do. After we had gone to the room, the clerk called to ask if the room was satisfactory and if we needed anything else --- that was such a nice courtesy!  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in this area.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Our stay at the ESA Mccarthy Ranch Milpitas has been very good. The staff is honest and communicate well.  The location has easy freeway access. There are Grocery Stores and  Many Restaurants close by.  It is quiet with lots of parking.  The area is nice for walks and is well kept. ** I am not a Fast Food  person so  Love having a nice sized kitchen.</Text></record>

Not really a hotel, more like motel with amenities. The room are not too big, even with 3-4 people in it looks packed. The wood floor inside the room looks really cheap and the AC/heater unit inside the room is way too loud. Probably should spent a few more dollars on other close by hotel.< /Review>

<Text>When I came to check-in, the power was out, so I TOTALLY understand this is not the staff nor the Hotel's fault, it was just a disappointing beginning to be IN THE DARK for 2 hours and not have Wifi either, and with COVID, we can't really go "hangout" anywhere either...perfect storm!

<review>I'm giving this score because the Extended Stay America didn't meet my needs or expectations. I choose this place because I needed a place to stay that I also could cook and excepted my pet. There was no one at the desk to check in. I called and waited 10 minutes. I checked in and was told to call if I needed anything.

Once in my room there was no cooking items. I called to tell the front desk I needed a full kit to cook. However, the front desk person said she was busy. I said ok but could she send the items I needed when she was done? I was told yes.  Forty five minutes later I got. Plastic box of items.In the box was : pan. Knife, fork, spoon, bowl , plate, cup, glass, cutting board, packet of soap and sponge. This group of items wasn't truly enough to be able cook. A Stake knife to chop vegetables? They addressed the basic needs if you ate cold cereal. Therefore, if you are out of town and want a place to stay and cook this place isn't it. Now I will have to go out buy items to cook with. After a long day of work this isn't what I want to do.

Thanks for your response to my review. However, what do you plan to do besides saying your sorry? It doesn't seem like your hotel has the capability to meet my expectations. This site  doesn't seem to have tools to allow visitors to cook. Do you plan make changes?  When working away from home it's important for me to maintain my health. I don't want to cook on the road I have to for health reasons.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1597742492359, 'text': 'Octavia, thank you for taking the time to post your feedback.

<text>Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice.

Ravi and the team is doing a wonderful job.

Thanks for making my trip a comfortable one. 6 weeks of good hospitality that I did not expect from 2 or 3 star hotel..

Will stay here again for sure..Keep up the good work team... Wishing you all the best..

Prepare to fork out the extra cash for the larger suite. The standard rooms are ridiculous small. Like a motel 6 with a cooking burner. But there's no ventilation. The windows only open a few inches. I couldn't imagine someone having an "extended stay" in one. Unless you get the master suite.<//text>

Negatives: The bed and sheets are not the very comfortable. The door to the restroom is dirty and door handles are sticky. Bathroom toilet roll handle almost falling off. Kitchen Cabinet drawers are dirty. Although the microwave, refrigerator, toilet and bathtub are well cleaned so that is why I'm giving it 4 stars. AC and television work well.

<Review>Suddenly planned trip to San jose, only this hotel had rooms available near the office I wanted to go. It was $143+taxes per day for the Deluxe Room. From the reviews I read from net, my expectations were low. It was corporate booking at corporate rate apparently. It was planned for 5 nights.

I reached this place around 8.30 AM on a Sunday morning. I had to wait in their common visitors area for around 30 mins to get the room. Yeap, it was an early check-in. Receptionist was helpful and managed to get a room cleaned as soon as possible once the housekeeping people were in.

Now comes to rooms :
Room : Room was clean and spacious enough. It had a kitchen area with Induction cook spaces and microwave. But no kitchen utensils! - But I think you get that from the Reception area if needed (not sure though). I am not a cooking person :). Bathroom was spacious enough with a bathtub. Basic stuff like bath soap, shampoo & hair drier are provided. The bath tub water blocker was broken needed repair & one table lamp was not working.

Service : Weekly room service only. You wont get room service if you are staying there for less than a week. So of course I was not eligible for room service. But if you need towels or other stuff you can just go and ask in the reception. I wanted an early check-in by cutting short the stay there by a day. I didn't face any problem they accepted the early check-in & returned the one days rent back to my credit card (5 days charge was taken in advance). It went smooth.

Complimentary breakfast : Its grab & go breakfast. Some packed oats (you can have with hot water - healthy though :) ), sweetened buns (danish pastry kind), oats bars & coffee/tea options.

Internet - Yes. free wifi available. Not high speed though but enough for basic stuffs.

Swimming pool - Not available

See the pics I have attached - to get an idea on how deluxe room looks like.

laundry service : self operated coin-washing machines available.
Suggestions :
- So this will be good for pure vegetarian(from India) people who like to cook there during extended stays
- Good locations, proximity to San jose office
- A chines market & restaurants are at walkable distance

Final verdict : I didn't find this place & service as bad as mentioned in other reviews. $143 + taxes doesn't look that cheap for me but yeah budget option compared to other hotels nearby. I think they have shortage of house keeping people and rooms need a little more maintenance.
So I will rate this average & recommend for people who are budget conscious, long stays, people who wants to cook for themselves during their stay.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The staff helped me get a better rate for my room which was awesome!!! She recommended I do my reservation online. I was a walk in late at night and every other place was over 100 which I didn't  want to spend since it was so late anyway.  Once I came back to the counter with my reservation was upgraded!!! I was very happy to get a great room, rest have my morning coffee and go.</text>< gmap_id>

The night shift clerk was not a nice or approachable woman. She gave me a key, and told me to sign the screen. That’s as much of a check in I got. Didn’t tell me what the WiFi was, breakfast, check out time, etc. nothing. The room was clean and quiet. Short drive to fast-food and a gas station. Overall good place to stay, but could use better staff.<//Text>

<review>Worst extended stay hotel ever. We have booked this place for our temporary 2 months stay. Our first problem is that that the wall isn't sound proof as any others. We could hear the neighboring rooms partying pass 4am, and intimating noises (that can be awkward). Second, the wifi connection is not as described. We could not connect to their fast wifi. We called front desk multiple times and called the customer tech supports everyday since we moved in to resolve the problem. Yet, the problem still occured. Nothing has been fixed or resolved. They said there will be a team onsite to work on it but it has been almost a week. I have not seen they solved the problem yet. Extended Stay America, you need to get your staff work harder instead of walking around and using their phones.<//review>< date>

Very friendly and accommodating front desk staff, place looks nice from the outside.  The room was a different story: Smelled like body odor, sheets were stained, found numerous hairs on the bedding.   I was going to give two stars but since the front desk staff were so friendly I reluctantly gave them three stars.

When I called to ask if there any rooms available I was told there were 18 rooms open and I needed to get there by 11 p.m. to check in because there'll be nobody at the front desk.
Just before 11 p.m. I notice  a sign on the door that said sold out. I'm guessing they do this because nobody is there after 11 p.m. so they lock the doors.

Amazing place to stay, got all u need for a short stay. Stayed here for a couple of weeks on my business trip.</review>

< review>
I am here since Sunday, No day in this hotel is perfect... Last two days just went ahead in it’s worst experience.

- Cleanliness is not priority. There were hair on towels in room. Bath tub outlet just takes forever to clear the water.

- Internet connection would break down in middle of Night and when you report to front desk, they would ask you to call customer care (As if I am not paying enough to stay) and I had to spend hours to get the Internet fixed. The next night again internet broke the same way, I had to rush to office at 6:30 in morning to attend important business call, before leaving for office I reported to front desk and the whole day passed but when I returned, still the internet is not fixed. Options offered by front desk: change the room (pack all luggage and kitchen stuff and change and still no guarantee that issue would be fixed.) anther option was to give internet upgrade (again no guarantee)

- Fridge started leaking water. Water all over the floor. When I reported this on front desk, I was told that I should have left fridge door opened (As if I haven’t used fridge ever) then I was told they would take a look during the day, I don’t know if anything got fixed or not.

Attaching photos to support what I am saying as I would be approached just after the putting the post to take it down.</review>

<text>The stay was comfortable. Our room had a kitchenette (2 burners, a sink, a microwave, and a nice sized fridge with freezer). They also give you the option of requesting dishes and cookware, which I appreciate. There was a grab-n-go type of breakfast that mainly had coffee and granola bars. My only complaint, but not a big one, is that the carpet in our was pretty wet on arrival. They must've just cleaned it, which in hindsight isn't bad. If you're looking for a place to crash for 1 or a few nights, this will sufffice.< /text><Date>1515891773501<//Date>< Pics>

<Name>eddie guerrero<//Name><Text>First thing I want to say is Naz and the manager whom I don't know his name  are awesome. very professional they helped me through  a little situation I was having they handled it very grate all I can say is 5 Stars to the front  desk clerk. As soon as you walk in the door they greet you treat you like family. To me I travel a lot and that's what I look for when I first walk in to the door. To see how they treat me when I walk in. So hands down the best place to be rooms are clean spacious what more do u want easy access to the highway close drive to everything around Levi's Stadium two exits down.😎🤙👍👌</Text><userid>106397172061840851174< /userid>< Rating>

1. PPL choose this hotel for Kitchen, esp for a long stay
2. for a Long stay they will clean  only once in a week
3. but they will not clean kitchen floor, tables, toilets, and bathtubs
4. mopping will be done only in the main area, not all corners

The response will be pathetic, for all compliments they are defending esp  Manger.< /review>

<Review>Location good. Rooms are decent. Love the fact that it is non smoking and has a kitchen where you can cook. Kitchen does have supplies that can be used for cooking. Pots, pans, plates, bowels, cutlery. Cups, etc. Helps save the cost of having to eat out.< /Review><time>1483021328741<//time>< Pics>

<Text>I'm rating this place 5 stars because of the customer service rep at the front desk named Jennifer. I was placed here temporarily due to some unforeseen circumstances, but she's been such a big help. She's been willing to go above and beyond to make sure my kids and I were comfortable and that means alot. I was in the lobby waiting to ask a question and I've seen the way she interacts with the other guests and how they all love her. The hotel is nice, quiet and comfortable. My kids love the breakfast in the mornings as well. But the true star has been Ms Jennifer. So thank you lady !!!!! ☺️</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>This should be closed down.
Why, you ask? Smoke detectors.
It is a criminal offense (I checked laws online) to operate a hotel without working smoke detector in all accessible areas.

I was here for 2 days while my apartment was undergoing some repairs. Chose this as it was close to my place, work and dog friendly.

First room checked in had no hot water (not even luke warm), so got it changed.
Second room was clean with a standard kitchenette. Both were of the same size, very very small. Barry any room to walk around anywhere. Water was slow to drain in bathroom sink.
I didnt notice it at first (had been a long day) but the smoke detector wasn’t in working condition. Was very tired and didn’t want to struggle finding another hotel for the next day,so ignored it and stayed the second night.

Front desk was helpful, room was clean (but very small). Extra pet fee.
Not worth the $.
I paid another 10 dollars more and got a much better hotel just 3 miles north.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhHUbJ_oTOAQPfabzPP9k_XABPI-I8Ig49tUht=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>The experience was ok. The housekeepers were friendly but the front desk clerk named Rohid wasnt inviting when I checked-in and he hesitated to accommodate me when I asked for a different room because the room smelled like smoke. I specifically booked a non-smoking room.  Eventually, he changed the room for me. Overall, i felt like Rohid did not provide good customer service to me. The new room i got was ok. The bed was stiff.< /text>< UserId.>

Rooms are clean but basic. (They come with bed, small kitchen facility, and bathroom). If you want utensils or any extras you need to ask at the front desk.   Some of the rooms are former smoking rooms so you may notice a smell of stale smoke.  There is free wifi which is a decent speed and a stable connection.  Breakfast is offered but I left for work early so wasn't able to check it out.<//Text>

< Review>
This is one of the best hotel in Milpitas to stay, very convenient, good service by the employees and complimentary breakfast. I want to appreciate the employees for providing white and clean towels every time, this laundry services are very good compared to other hotels in their range.
All the employees are customer friendly, I met one of the employee name Naz, she is very friendly and always provide her best support to the customers, always maintain smile on her face  and  the best receptionist I met in Extended Stay America and other hotels.

Keep maintain the best service from you Naz and your team, All the best.</Review>

Greeted by Naz with a warm friendly smile and hello, made me feel welcome and at home with friendly small chit chat while she checked me and my sister in our rooms was. Naz was very accommodating and helpful , just from the 5 star service I received checking in i knew I would definitely come back. The rooms was clean, as well as property . Quiet Safe Area will stay Again< /Review>

<Review>Hotel did not have a smoking room as thats what I booked. They said they would transfer my reservation to a different extended stay in the same city that had a smoking room. I was charged by both hotels on my credit card. the extended stay  McCarthy ranch extended stay is acting like I was a no show and the hillview  extended stay is acting like I was a new guest. Now I have to drive to try and fight them to get the money they ripped me off.

<text>I've been visiting the bay area for work on a regular basis over the past few months and I absolutely need a place to stay that has accommodations for me when I stay a few weeks at a time. I'm so thrilled that my company put me in this Extended Stay. They give me anything I need to cook and make meals in my room. Fullsize closet, tons of plugs for all my digital gadget, dresser, a table to eat meals, and a laundry room that's open 24/7 that is cheaper than the local spots. I've had two check-ins here and both times the front desk was courteous and they are always readily available everytime I need something, i.e: extra blankets or change for the laundry. Hot coffee in the morning for my drive to work is a plus too! It's also in a great spot. There is a Walmart 5 minutes away as well as a variety of food and shopping and I can get to all my stores in the area for work within 20 minutes which I feel is a small miracle for traffic in the bay area. 5/5 would stay again.<//text><Name>Janiece Manthey<//Name><Gmap_id>0x808fc9216d858581:0x678498ff776f899f</Gmap_id>< date>

It was fine for what I needed it for.  The fan in the bathroom didn't work and the hairdryer didn't work either.  Friendly staff, but the patrons were very loud next to me (not the staff's fault, but the design of the hotel lent it to being a noisy situation).<//text>

<review>I have stayed for several months in all the hotels in the vicinity (Milpitas). This is a very nice and affordable hotel to stay. The price is unbeatable compared to all the hotels in the vicinity (almost 1/2 to 1/3rd less!). Very close to grocery store and various asian restaurants. A 5 min car ride will take you to Bestbuy, Walmart, in & Out, Ross and McCarthy Ranch which has all hotels that you can ask for. The hotel  has  a kitchen in the room which is the best advantage. Your room is cleaned once a week.  High speed internet comes at an extra price.

Positives:
1. A decent size kitchen with 2 burner electric stove, Regrigerator, Kitchen utensils and Microwave.
2. A large size bathroom with bath tub.
3. A table for working. Large size room.
4. Rooms has a TV with lot of channels.
5. The staff (especially Trang in the front desk and Manager Khan ) are very friendly and  very concerned about your stay and comfort. They constantly seek your feedback and work on it.
6. Basic breakfast  if free - muffin, oats, coffee/ tea.
7. The price is very affordable.

Overall i am happy to have chosen this hotel.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Small rooms with basic amenities, old look, clean rooms. You have to ask for utensils and cutlery. Breakfast is just coffee and muffins! Staff is friendly but unprofessional.<//text>

<Text>Horrible Wifi & no breakfast after 8 even if it is readymade cookies. Rates are high always.  I am from India, still I felt the US wifi is horrible. 750kbps  is the free wifi maximum data rate and it wont login and you will keep playing with login page. I never complained about a wifi, in hotels in USA, atleast 1 month every year, i come in USA.</Text>< pictures>

Morning breakfast (complimentary) could be improved, in the sense can keep rotating the items on alternate days.
Laundry place is clean and get support in the lobby w.r.t the coins.
Wifi reception is also good within the rooms.
Parking space is first come first serve, so if you return late from office you may end up parking in the adjacent block.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808fc9216d858581:0x678498ff776f899f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We are at the Mcarthy Ranch location and really love the staff the rooms are very nice and the location is great. Right next to highway 237 and 880 as well as directly across from McCarthy Ranch shopping Center with plenty of fast food restaurants, sit down restaurants , walmart, best buy, pets mart, and many more . Basically it is a great location with evertything you need close buy. We will definately be staying here again.< /Review>

Location is HORRIBLE, the ever present stench of the waste water treatment plant nearby only increases at night. In high temperature weather you may as well not bother showering or changing clothes as it WILL embed itself in your clothes and travel home with you. So in other words great place as long as you say indoors.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Can be difficult to find your room if you don't know exactly which building it is in (despite instructions from the front desk). There's only what felt like 6 channels on TV.

<Text>There are many other hotels in the area that were much nicer than this one for about the same rate.  The lock on my door didnt work, anyone could walk into my room without a key.  The staff got notified twice and no corrective action was taken until after I left.  They did give me a free nights stay coupon, but very leery to stay in another of these or that one again.  Front desk tried to reassure me that neighborhood was safe, and saw busted out car windows in our parking lot the next morning.  I would look into the springfield suites or crowne plaza a block away.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>I'll never stay at an Extended Stay again. Room was booked to be ready by 6pm. Arrived at 9pm due to traffic only to be told that it would be a few more HOURS before the room was ready! When it was, I was shocked at how cheap and shoddy the room was. A single set of towels, not even a cup to drink some water, but the mold above the shower was truly a nice touch. I was surprised there was even a blanket on the bed. Talk about sad!</Text>< Pictures>

NAZ!!! IS THE REASON PEOPLE COME BACK!!!!!!!!
I can not say enough good things about her but I am gonna try..
(MANAGEMENT OR CORPERATE I HOPE YOU READ THIS). she is a SUPER ASSET to your business..she is AWSOME!!! great attitude great personality. AMAZING  customer service.. She makes you feel welcome  and like your a old friend coming back for a visit.. she goes out of her way to make sure there is nothing wrong with the room.
What other hotel do you know calls just to check if everything is ok?! Seriously!?!?

I have been there multiple times I stoped using this hotel because of previous staff..

They must have revamped.. New staff new work ethic  new attitude..</text>

Long wait to check in despite lack of business. Room is outdated and poorly constructed. Hope you brought you own soap as all they provide is shampoo. Kitchen is sad and does not include any utensils.</Review>

<Review>Torn carpet in my room, bathroom door looks like it was punched in at one point and they attempted repair with plaster and painted over. The kitchenette doesn't have any actual cups/pots/utensils etc. just 2 plastic disposable water cups that's supposed to last you through your stay. The room smells of stale cigarettes and there are flies coming from the drain of the tub which looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a few years. The trash can in the bathroom sink was full when I arrived. The pillows are of cheap prickly bird feathers. The internet works for about 30 seconds at a time. There is no safe in the room. But other than that it was great for $220/nt.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Nice place to stay and had a pleasent stay. Recommended if you cook on your own and want to save on high restaurant bills.

The hotel does not have a restaurant however they do have a complementary breakfast which includes coffee, snack bars , cakes, chocolate etc. These are good to grab and rush to work.

The staff is very proffessional. Room service happens once every week if you are staying longer.

About the facility:

The rooms are clean.
My refrigerator leaked water. The hotel tried to service it initially. Then they replaced it.
There is cooking equipment made available to you if you want to cook in your room. The free internet is sufficient for Skype calls or YouTube streaming. Mcarthy Ranch market is close by for grocery shopping. Laundry rooms are coin operated.<//Review></record>

< Review>
dirty kitchen utensils, bars, muffin and oats for breakfast, weekly once cleaning, noisy shower and much more. a hotel with daily charge of 100-120 should have better options.
some more add ons: laundry dryer was not working for 2 weeks and they could not get it repaired, room service is weekly and often it used to turn out to be biweekly, i had to call front desk and manager every other day to check why my room was not cleaned. would never visit them again neither i will recommend anyone in my group to stay there.

have booked for a month and i don't have option to move to any other hotel, since all are almost full.<//Review>

1) Inconvenience caused due to WiFi and lift not working for the last few days of stay
3) since lift was not working during our checkout, we requested at the reception for help to move our luggages to lobby from second floor. But the lady at the reception said, she doesnt  have anyone do it and we are forced to take the luggage downstairs by ourselves. Later we argued with her and she accepted to send maintenance guy at last. However, Rohit at reception, made an apology later for this and helped.
4)Bad smell was coming out of the room opposite to where we stayed. Our room was 367. And we complained regarding this and they took their own time to fix this.
5)The hotel key, sometimes not works at some of the entrances. I had to try  4 to 5  times to enter. I reported this issue also to the reception, but the reply was "the door got issues !".
We stayed  for 30days here. And this is what our experience is.
7) Water was leaking from the bottom of the commode during last week of stay.</text>

I was living there for a three months in 2011. Each room has a small kitchen and personal exit to the parking. Great place to stay for a long time you are filling yourself as in your own home.</review>

<Text>This is a capture of my survey when they asked me about my stay.
The manager's solution to this review was to offer me some free nights. As if a free night in a poor quality place would make me happier.  I told him a partial refund is what was in order and in the following 2 weeks,  I have not heard from him again.

Stay was just ok.  The refrigerator was dirty as we're the ice cube trays.  I left my laptop there and because I wasn't in the area, I got the runaround for 4 months.  Now that I am back in the area, I called again at 6 p.m. on May 8th and the guy was so sarcastic I became angry.  He told me what month it was and said it wasn't there when he never even put me on hold to check like the other representatives did.  That was a 17.3" Samsung touchscreen.  Way to treat a homeless, disabled veteran.  I'm going to sue.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><text>This was the worst place I have ever stayed. My company booked the room because everywhere else was booked solid. I was suppose to stay for a week but left as soon as ANYWHERE else was available. Not only did my room overwhelmingly stink of cigarette smoke, but the bathroom was dirty, and the bed was awful. I saw stray hairs still around the shower and rust stains around the shower fixtures. My key card failed to work on multiple occasions and the front desk attendant was slow and inattentive. I left my USB charger behind. I tried calling multiple times to see if it was found and was kept on hold for more than 20 minutes each time.

ALSO, the photos posted about the location are NOT real photos of this facility. DOn't be fooled. And, if you don't like curry, do not stay here. The insides and outside of the buildings smelled like spoiled curry.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808fc9216d858581:0x678498ff776f899f<//Gmap_id></record>

I have stayed here because of my employer gave me 2 weeks of accommodation. Clear reasons why I am giving 1 star are
1. Very stinki place. The moment you enter in hotel you get very very dark odour. Same odour is in elevators and corridors.
2. They do room service only once in a week. So if you are staying for 5 6 days then they will not do your room service.
3. For us they didn't do room service after a week as well saying they are busy. After requesting and then complaining they did room service after 9 days.
4. NO BREAKFAST. they just grab and go. Muffins, coffee and protein bar. No seating area.
I have lived in other extended stay but never had this experience. In motels/inn we get better breakfast for lesser room rate.<//Review>

WORSE hotel I have ever stayed in. Dirty room with Free Bed Bugs. bathroom and kitchen were old and lots of mark of bugs.

We booked for 1 week and stayed only for 6 hours in night. By morning kids were badly bitten by Bed bugs.

I did written complains on hotel desk as well as on their corporate site But no one responded back.

Dirty rooms with flies and trash kept open under neath the stairs. In the same amount  you will get similar extended stays  nearby.  Just avoid this location that's all I can say.<//Review>

<Review>Extended Stay Milpitas features much smaller suites than other ESs Ive been to but management didnt give us any grief when we were still partying with our neighbors at 4AM. If youre going to a 49ers game and dont care much about normal hotel perks this hotel works.< /Review><time>1435708800000</time>< GmapID>
