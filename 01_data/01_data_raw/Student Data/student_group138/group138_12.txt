<text>Good advice for indoor plants. Great social distancing practices.

I'm a newbie gardener, so the amazing selection was overwhelming. Expert gardeners will be impressed.

Bulk bags of soil, premier plant food. Living plants, and great free advice.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c25ae34b7b1499:0x34e82afce3dc2ec0</gmap_id></record>

Love this spot. Owner is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Selection better than other AV hydro stores I've been in. Nice rotating shelf of used hardware, efficient staff, easy parking, honestly I'm not gonna handle it well if I ever move away and need to find a new shop lol< /Text>

This family-run business has a great Covid-19 protocol. Much safer than Home Depot or Walmart. They are all knowledgeable and have the best selection of great soil and nutrients and gardening accessories. Whether growing tomatoes or orchids or anything else.<//review>

The positive reviews about this place are no joke. This hydroponics store is very large it has everything you'll need from fertilizer to HPS lights and tents. BTW Bill has first hand experience growing and is extremely knowledgeable.< /Review>

Bill and his family are the nicest people. Very knowledgeable on truly ALL of their products. They go above and beyond to make sure we have the supplies we need. We drive over 150 miles to get the unbeatable service at Room To Grow.< /Review>

I have found the personal assistance and knowledge given at Room to Grow to be Excellent! The recent advancements made horticulture are vast. To have an all in one place for supplies and solid advise by all involved, sets a standard not normally found in contemporary venues.
The other (and may I add, very important) aspect is price. Their prices surprisingly are very competitive with Amazon products and the other hydroponic store (located in Palmdale). Since their prices are very competitive, it gives the customer the advantage to immediately pick up your badly needed supplies in the event you can't wait (for online delivery).
I am a supporter of small business. Not for the sake of keeping this type of business alive, but because small business has the best knowledge and service needed for those who take their endeavors seriously.
I have sought advice many times from RTG. The results have been 100% correct. I have saved money by taking advantage of their years of experience.
I don't write reviews. However, coming from the retail side of customer service, I can appreciate excellent service. This review was very necessary.
Oh yeah, the owner even wrote a book on the subject of Indoor Growing. Buy a book, and get it autographed by the business owner. You can't do better than that!<//text>

This hydro store is the best.  The staff is all very knowledgeable and helpful.  The products are competitively priced and the more often and more items you buy the deeper the discounts they give you.  They stand behind all their equipment and supplies 100% even the used equipment they sell.  If they don't have something you need or the size you need it they will order it for you.  The store is family owned and operated and feels more like home to me now then a store.<//review>

Friendly staff. Convenient to be able to find everything in one place, instead of driving to multiple hardware stores. However, prices are ridiculously high. I find that you can order most of their products on Amazon for 1/2 - 1/4 of their price.< /review>

Bought a used greenhouse controller w/ the understanding the it had a c02 component, once I downloaded the instruction manual, on go. Humidity and temp only. Tried to return it, they wouldn't take it back. Out a hundred dollars. Told them I would take store credit, still no go. There are 2 other stores in the area I'll start to use instead.<//review>

I was very disappointed with my experience once again. They didn't seem to know much about what they sell. There prices were very high. They are selling a bag of Happy Frog for 17 when they sell a bag for 10 or 12 in Victorville. They sell Gavita for 700 and they sell the same Gavita on Amazon and Discount Hydro in Victorville for less then 500. They are out of date. They don't sell MH or HPS bulbs in DE made by Phillip or Solis. People of Antelope Valley should know they are not getting the service or price they should get.<//Text>

Really nice girls that work there. They are super helpful, and know what they're talking about. I went in needed help with piping for my aquaponics system, and even though they sell hydroponics sytems only she helped me figure the piping a great deal. I've also came in here to buy organic OMRI pesticidal soap for my veggie garden that they dont sell at the big box home improvment shop. I haven't felt the need to go anywhere else.</review>

Really friendly staff helped us find their biggest double kayak and climb in with two large dogs. The harbor was beautiful and paddling was fun and easy. Great day for $20!< /text>

< review>
First time renting a boat (electric 12 seater):

1. Called 1 week earlier to reserve (they answer from an office on docks so it rings for a bit before reaching someone)

2. An employee called 3 days prior to confirm reservations

3.showed up at the appointment time to sign some paperwork (takes less than 3 minutes).

4. Got on the boat and got a quick briefing and signed another document

5. Got pushed off the dock, enjoyed the experience, and was helped back to the dock.

No hassle, easy to do business with, and straightforward company @ a reasonable price.< /review>

I had seen the fleet of Hopper boats for years around the Channel Islands Harbor and only just recently decided to check it out for myself. I was in for quite a surprise as were my guests. I brought 5 friends and the plan was to spend a couple hours during the holiday season to check out the decorated boats and houses in the area. Sarah (owner and operator) accommodated my group and from the get go everything was very professional in a relaxed atmosphere. The boat we rented was clean and surprisingly good condition considering some of the antics that I had seen other clients performing throughout the years. All care had been provided to ensure that we were well informed and comfortable in the operation and safety of "Current Affair". The time on the water went without a single adverse incident, and for me, was an awesome and convenient way for me to entertain my out of town friends on a budget ($65/hour plus well deserved tip was $30/person). Alcohol was allowed, another bonus, and the only drawback and reason we didn't use 3 hours is the total lack of public use docks and bathrooms in the harbor! Upon our return, Sarah was waiting for us in order to take any remaining guess work out of the equation- docking a boat is one of the most underrated ways to feel like a pro, and with Sarah's assistance, we were able to avoid the loud crunch I hear all the time during the summer, and instead were quickly tied to the cleats and helped out (a couple of us needed the help to be sure). All on all, an excellent experience that will have me coming back again! Cheers!<//Review>

<Text>Very friendly staff and we like their business hours, they open at 11am. We rented from them a couple of times now and never had any problems. It takes about 1 hour to do a full circle around the channel/harbor. Sea lions hang around the area, swim by and lounge on the docks.< /Text>< user_id>

I’ve used them multiple times in the past. But today - I get it things break, but it’s how you respond to adversity what defines you as Business. We went out today on the 8 seater boat with 2 small kids and honeymoon guests from abroad. 20 min into our trip, the boat lost all pulling power, engine started working very loud and we smelled burn. I’ve called the company 3-4 times with no success. Good Samaritan helped us get the boat out of the middle of channels to shut down the motor; they also called Harbor rescue who were able to contact owner. Owner response was they have a lot of customer waiting and they will get to us soon. To make the story short, it took us 3 hours, failed Lyft experience and another Good Samaritan who drove us back to our car.  Yes, I did get my money back but leaving entire family with small kids under the sun in the middle of canal with failed engine...I would never recommend this company.
There are many other boat rental companies with newer equipment and way better services.< /Text>

I have used Hopper several times over the past few years. Most recently, I rented a double kayak taking my 7 yr old grandson out on his first kayak adventure. They have always been helpful, friendly and courteous without exception! The equipment has been in good condition also! I don't understand the negative reviews- and just a note to  some of them--- your butt gets wet in a kayak!... It just does!! I highly recommend them!<//Text>

<name>rhemydog pincher<//name><time>1403982679780<//time><rating>1<//rating><text>Yesterday, June 27, 2014, we had the unfortunate experience of renting two double kayaks from the Hopper Kayak facility at Channel Islands Harbor. I say it was unfortunate because the staff at the this facility clearly is not aware of the weight limitations and safety issues associated with each kayak, nor do them seem to care.

My daughter and her boyfriend rented on double kayak, and it appeared to be too small for them. The woman running the business insisted it would be fine. Halfway around the trip the kayak suddenly keeled over, putting both riders into the water. They flipped the kayak over and re-entered the vessel. After getting rebalanced they started off only to have the kayak again flip. My husband and other daughter were in the second double kayak. My husband traded places with my daughter in the unstable kayak and again the kayak flipped over. The only way to keep the kayak upright was to put my younger, lightweight daughter with my husband in the unstable kayak and limp back to the rental facility - the entire rear end of the kayak was under water.

Upon arrival at the rental facility, my husband asked the staff if they were familiar with the weight limits on the kayaks - they had no idea what he was talking about. He told them what happened and asked for a refund, which was flatly denied. While observing the deck hand as he pulled the kayak out of the water, we could see the hull had a defect and was so heavy from taking on water he could hardly pull the thing out of the water and onto the deck.

When this was pointed out to the lady in charge she became extremely rude and denied there was anything wrong with the kayak. She indicated the kayaks were supposed to take on water! Seriously?!

Our concern at this point is some other family is going to rent this kayak, and a much more negative outcome is going to occur. This rental facility needs to, at a minimum, remove this defective kayak from it's fleet. The kayak was a sit on top, blue grey in color and had #13 on the bow.

In addition, the facility needs to provide boaters with life jackets that will actually fit. The ones they provided for my daughter and boyfriend not only did not fit, but were not rated for the weight of my daughter and her boyfriend.

Needless to say, we won't ever be returning to this place nor will we ever recommend it.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80e84e24c2206265:0x3a970b77bcf807a2</gmapID></record>

I had an appointment to treat a recent gout flare. The entire visit lasted 2.5hrs which was relatively short for an urgent care visit. The registration process went smoothly and the front desk staff (Justin?) was very courteous. I am even more impressed with the medical staff (medical assistant and PA, thanks!) for their excellent bed manners and professionalism. The proposed treatment turned out to be very successful and the gout problem was solved within 48 hours. The only small shortcoming is that ActionCare does not support patient login accounts so I cannot conveniently retrieve my visit records online.</Text>

< Review>
Had a great experience with action urgent care. They were very attentive and helped me with a knee injury. I’m recovering well thanks to PA Yesim, she followed up with some exercises I can do at home. Joseph and Arianna were extremely friendly and welcoming right when I walked in, I would highly recommend coming here!</Review>

I had two visits to Action Urgent Care.
04/28/2021:
- Patient Intake/Receptionist: Elena DL is calm but warm, keeps you informed and makes you feel welcome. She was efficient and thoughtful, and remembered me right away at my next visit. Elena is wonderful as the first person you meet at Action Urgent Care!
- Dylan compassionate, professional, knowledgeable, and thorough. He listened to me patiently and thoroughly noted all of my conditions, which really helped put me at ease. He is absolutely in the exact right profession!
- Yasmin Kanlioglu was also incredibly professional, skilled, effective, but also caring and warm. I wish I could have hugged her!
At a time of incredible nerve pain and feeling vulnerable and overwhelmed, particularly as this was my very first visit to Action Urgent Care, I was so grateful to have encountered such exceptional and qualified care.

04/29/2021:
- I encountered Dylan again, and he once again took great care of me. I was not in as much pain as the night before and was able to get a good night's sleep for the first time in nearly two weeks, thanks to his and Yasmin's care. I could tell that Dylan really did genuinely feel relieved and happy to see that I had had some improvement in health.
- E. Engelhaupt-
She was incredibly thoughtful, fully aware of my recent background and concerns, and followed up on every pertinent detail to ensure my care continued. I felt comfortable and confident in her care.<//Text>

<user_name>fatima paola< /user_name><Review>They have a fee if you don’t cancel your appointments on time, however what about them? They are never on time with the virtual appointments, no ones calls to check you in, all my appointments I have to call and if they answer I am lucky because those phone lines are insane they never pick up. They should hire staff for just phone calls, in person service is great and fast, however virtual appointments which you think would be faster are terrible.  They don call to check in, don’t send the links, a virtual appointment takes over an hour just to get assistance for the link itself.<//Review><Rate>3</Rate></record></dataset><record>
<Text>I checked in quickly and the receptionist took my co-payment. But after that, the reception disappeared and I was left unattended in the waiting area for 30 minutes. Eventually, I got a hold of someone and escalated the extended waiting concern. Then, I was brought into a patient room. The physician did attend the diagnosis quickly and asked a nurse to treat the wound. From there, that’s another 20 minutes of waiting before I escalate and get a nurse coming to care. Later when I asked to take a photo of my own x-ray result, the staff would charge $30 for my own x-ray that I paid to take. I chose Action Urgent Care for its speed of service and friendliness of staffs. But totally disappointed by today’s experience.< /Text><name>Fei Nan</name>< rating>

I have been tested twice now at this location. Joseph is working the drive through lane here and he has been really easy to work with. He is very polite and professional. He eased my anxiety about the whole process with his kind demeanor and calm energy. I was in and out of there in under 5 minutes and I had my results in just a few hours. Thank you Joseph and the team at Active Urgent Care!< /text>

If the answer to phone and that's a big if the communications at this place is just horrible. Your pharmacy will try to call them to refill prescriptions but they never return phone calls. They don't answer the phone. they really need to work under customer service skills and their phone skills.< /text>

<review>Came in to do a walk in COVID  Test done today with my daughter to travel back to Canada, non of the placed we tried did this required test or made it possible for us to get it done to as they all require some app to download ( works for US residents only) so no foreigners can download app to do the test. They were the only ones who would do it and helped us to get it done so we could travel back home. I don't know what else I would do if it was not for 2 girls that worked really hard and were so companionate and willing to helps us. The 2 girls that worked on the evening of 25 February 2021 were god sent. THANK YOU!

ps. for the app developers, you should include option so anyone visiting, traveling trough or whatever could be able to used the app.</review><GmapID>0x808fcaacba30086d:0xd95efed7e7001673</GmapID>< userid>

<Review>Horrible. The nurse practitioner at the montegue location did not fully assess me. I was there for abdominal pain and she never palpated my abdomen and no pregnancy test. These are standard procedures for any woman of child-bearing age with abdominal pain to partially rule out ectopic pregnancy. She did not listen to my concerns and said i probably pulled a muscle and agreed to at least treat me for pyelo since i already had a UTI. She was about to draw my blood with the wrong blood tube. I had to insist to 3 diff employees to double check so that she didnt have to redraw because I’m a hard stick. Finally the tech checked online and confirmed she had the wrong tube for a cbc. I got her to order an ultrasound. Got stuck twice and no blood. Had to go to a different location and wait until the next day to get the ultrasound in my excruciating pain. When i arrived for the ultrasound the next day, she had ordered an ultrasound of my upper abdomen when my pain was in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen near my groin. I had to spend an extra hour there trying to get in touch with the other location to get the right order added. Nobody ever called with my results and when i tried to call i kept getting rerouted to other locations with no help. I was told to just keep calling until the right location answered. I finally ended up in the ER with my pain and had a kidney stone but this urgent care wasted 3 days of my time and money and caused me to be in pain 3 days longer than i should have. Don’t go there.</Review><response>None<//response>< Rate>

I have been going here frequently for any emergent care. I am always seen right away and they really do go above and beyond to find excellent providers. As of recently I will be having them as my primary care and I am super confident in them.< /Text>

I found them via the mobile app Kyla, to get a COVID test.

First the mobile app.  The set up is simple enough for the situation, even though the insurance card verification fails the first time I tried for no apparent reasons.  the process of securing an appointment is both intuitive and frustrating - the automated part of going through the routine questions is very easy to follow, the problem arises when you have to interact with a human, first a provider to ascertain your eligibility, then a nurse to actual schedule the appointment.  you tend to have to wait several minutes for either of them to show up, and it's hard to pay attention to the phone all that time, if you miss the human response by a few minutes, you'll have to restart the process again.  Also, even though the app says 9am-8pm, they seem to stop responding at around 7pm instead.  the combination of having to wait for minutes for human response, and having to restart if you don't respond right away, makes the experience frustrating.

Now the positives - I was able to secure an appointment within 24 hours both times I tried, the test site I use is drive through, staff is friendly and professional, the process is quick and painless, and the best part, the results came back the same day at 11pm, both times.  thumbs up.</review>

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER DO NOT GO HERE TO GET TESTED
This location is indicated to me by a testing app, getting them on the phone is impossible, while on the first occasion I was able to get the test now they refused to give me any test result even though they have it . First they say it is not secure over the phone , when I asked to go pick up my results and they refuse to allow me to get my results (first time I got them in paper in 10 minutes ) . I can not conceive why they have refuse to provide me with my results. I will never return .Note to management : try to make sure your staff does not arbitrarily hung up on your customers, they will probably get annoyed as I did.<//Review>

The virtual call was surprisingly effective. The doctor could see what was wrong On my skin and from my description of my symptoms was able to prescribe exactly what I needed. It’s been three days since I spoke to her and I feel better and my skin lesion is clearing up.</text>

<Text>This was an example of how all Virus testing should be done. You call and get screened, you have a video appointment with a doctor, you go to a drive through testing facility and then get your results. Staying responsible and safe would be possible for more people if there were more organizations like this!</Text><Time>1597103196174< /Time>< user>

Visited for getting a Covid Rt-Pcr test for my father. Glad to find this place.

Pros:
1. Rt-Pcr test at 95$ is a steal! Found that other places are charging 160 - 250$.
2. Got the results on the same day. In fact, within 90 minutes. Other testing sites that I contacted mentioned that they'll take anywhere from  2-7 days to get the results for Rt-Pcr test.

Cons:
1. You'll make appointment through an app named Kyla. I have made the appointment on the spot, so no problem there, but its kinda weird that the whole appointment process, payment and getting results is over a chatbot. Not difficult to figure out though.< /review>

App is painful. No human and no response for hours drives you nuts.  My Covid test was done by a very inexperienced nurse and I did not not trust result.

Overall got test done same day and result too. But was bit frustrating</Review>

I went here for a medical condition because my primary physician's office is closed during weekends and I don't want to go to the ER since my situation is not that serious based on my self evaluation. Its structure (which may look small) is at the parking lot near the mall, shops and apartments. Upon entering, you'll find  a well lit wide receiving area with plenty of seats lined up for waiting patients. They will first gather your medical history, measure your weight, height and take your blood pressure. The in-house physician will diagnose your symptoms, electronically prescribe medication directly to your preferred pharmacy and send you off with a firm assurance that you'll be feeling better. However, the downside is that you may not get the same physician on your follow up checkup. Anyhow, I no doubt had a positive experience with them and they come highly recommended in my book.</Text>

<text>#1) They DO NOT return phone calls regarding appointments. In other words, if you are a disabled person and you need to let them know that you cannot sit for very long,  to get into see the doctor they will not make arrangements for you beforehand. So if this is something that you need to work out with a healthcare professional, this is not the place to go to. Not returning phone calls in a medical facility is the most unprofessional thing I can think of. I made an appointment with the clinic a year before and had the same problem, but I forgot that the only way you can make an appointment is online because they do not return phone calls.

2. So, after making an appointment the first time it still took me 45 minutes to get in. No one was coming in, nor leaving the office, and when I went through the hallways I could see no one in the hallways and no one in any of the rooms so I couldn’t figure out why I had waited 45 minutes after purposefully making an appointment so that I wouldn’t have to wait. So, that was a problem right off the top that I was very unhappy with.

3. Next: I went in to get a certain kind of pain medication and they told me that they would have to look into it. The next day they called to inform me that they do have a doctor that can prescribe the medication. However, a little while later called letting me know are that the doctor was not licensed to prescribe the medication. In other words one hand doesn’t know what the other one is doing. Another problem I had was with their billing. They also tried charging me for the appointment; something that Medicare eventually picked up so I was also upset about that. I do not recommend this clinic if you need professional help because from what I can tell they’re nice and friendly; The place is clean, but are anything but wholly professional. They would be my last choice for "Urgent Care" so if that was the case with you, the reader, go to an emergency room because you’d probably be far better off.

Finally, again yesterday I left a message explaining my situation and again no return phone call. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all cost.</text>< pics>

Low wait times but VERY BAD billing practices and poor followup on services like renewing prescriptions, etc.  Rude employees who seem to have been only  trained to extract money first before any discussion.  Once the front desk clerk insisted on my paying an amount from a previous bill which was incorrect on  her records but she could not verify because of down computers...and was preventing me from seeing a doctor with whom I had a followup appointment.  FOrtunately, the doctor came and saw me...but the experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  Have had several other poor experiences.</review>

Action urgent care has helped me on several occasions and it is definitely beneficial that they are open later than a lot of urgent medical care agencies. I trust their feedback and would definitely recommend to a friend. Thank you!</review>

< review>
Clean, large (waiting room) facility; efficient, caring staff.
I wasn't feeling well at all when arriving at Acton Urgent Care, after being turned away at another facility (was half hour before closing, but they couldn't see me).
The intake process was relatively easy (I have insurance) & copay similar to my Dr's office. Intake tech was friendly, helpful, and even tho having to deal with multiple people at once, pretty fast too.
Once I was called for the exam, the nurse was quick & thorough. The Dr was the same, & necessary tests & prescriptions were made expeditiously.
This was the first time I ever used an urgent care facility & altho I felt sick as a dog, my experience was very positive.
If needed again, I will definitely utilize Actin Urgent Care. Recommend!< /review>

<Review>This is the SLOWEST urgent care facility I have ever experienced. Each time I bring one of my three small children here we wait and wait and wait. Difficult to do with small children. They also are not equipped for infants. None of the staff appear particularly competent and do not provide clear diagnosis -  providing too many prescriptions. Go to Sutter Health Urgent Care in Gilroy. Much more professional, knowledgeable and competent.</Review>< Pics>

Do NOT get tested for covid-19 here. They do not give results. They will cancel your appointment within 30 minutes of it and call that a "courtesy call" and tell you you need to virtually meet with their medical team first. I booked an appointment at least 3 days in advance and they could not have done this "courtesy call" earlier. They do not pick up their phones when you try to call them, or leave a voicemail. They say that they will call you when results come. They also say you need to call them to get your results. They will not email it to you -- they have an excuse for that. I don't understand how I can get my results from these people if they 1) don't pick up my phone 2) don't return my voicemails 3) ignore my emails. Basically they may or may not give you your results. Update: it has been over 18 days and I still haven't gotten my results. I have been waiting with a terrible fever. They are such a joke. Do not waste your time with this scam clinic.<//text>

I have regular monthly appointments for prescription refills. Everytime is a different experience. The best is that the staff is pleasant, helpful and caring. The worst is that each appointment has a long wait time even when you set an appointment. I waited 45 mins passed my scheduled time just for a simple refill that literally takes the doctor a few moments to complete as I am regular patient. Change must be made because it seems like they need to reorganize their time management because I waste so much time waiting.<//review>

Needed urgent care while on vacation. I was able to book an appointment ahead of time, get seen just minutes after filling out my paperwork, and then get a much needed prescription just minutes after that at the pharmacy around the corner. Far more efficient than my usual clinic back home in Portland.< /text>

Everything was great - the attitude, the service, the wait time. We were a walk-in without an appointment about an hour before they were closing. We waited for about half hour. The doctor was knowledgeable and professional. I would definitely recommend it to other people. We were at the Hamilton location.</text>

< Review>
I visited this place for UTI. They charged me 35 copy and took urine sample. The nurse ask me questions without having a real look and gave me prescriptions. I don’t know how she was sure it was UTI. A few days later I asked for a copy of urine test results so I can show to family doctor. I was told that urine example was not enough for a test and I have to come again. So if I haven’t asked for it, they wouldn’t let me know me and no one could tell if they gave me the right medicine. When I got test results from the second one, the paper only shows “no growth” as test result. I asked what it means and if I can get detailed info, they requested me to made another appointment so they can earn another $35. Thank you!< /Review>

I went to urgent care because it was the weekend so instead of calling my doctors service I thought maybe it would be better if a doctor looked at me.  I was miserable and couldn't hold out another day .  After explaining my symptoms and what meds my doctor had put me on the woman told me I also have a sinus  infection.  then actually said "so what would you like me to do for you" .....oh I don't know,  I thought you were the professional!!!  Didn't give me a whole lot of confidence in her.<//Review>

<review>The staff is nice, however,  per their policy that isn't noted anywhere nor do they tell you when making an appointment there is a $50.00 no show fee.
They always make you return for test results,  they won't mail them to you, or call you.< /review>< Pictures>

I was face a difficult time with my finger’s cut. I went to Action Urgent Care, they provided an excellent service to treat me promptly. I felt good and didn’t get any infarction. High recommend to choose Action Urgent Care if you needed. It is much more faster than ER.  Thanks a lot for their great job.< /review>

I highly recommend this place! I’ve been twice and both times was greeted by friendly, professional staff. It’s easy to make an appt online,  office is clean and I didn’t have to wait. I tend to get anxious with needles, but the nurse made me feel so at ease- it was no big deal! :)<//Text>

<text>The doctor who visited me was actually very helpful and professional, but this review goes to the urgent care organization. When i arrived the first time, i asked at the front desk to make sure that my insurance would have covered the entire cost of the visits, they assured me it was all covered. I had a second visit at another branch in San Jose to take an X-Ray, I asked there the same question and the answer was the same. My insurance would have covered 100% of my visits. After a few weeks I received an email from them saying that i had an outstanding balance of 672$. I’m now disputing that of course...< /text>< UserId.>

<text>After I filled out the forms--done on a tablet, which was convenient--I was asked to give them a credit card to put on file. Since I was not paying them anything, I saw no reason to do so--especially since some reviews I had seen complained of charges made later on a card for no reason. I asked the reason, was told it was company policy that they required it and the card would only be used with my authorization. I asked the young lady saying that if she was willing to be recorded making that statement, and she declined and left. The other young lady said I would just  be listed as having declined to offer my card--so it was not really required at all, contrary to the claim of the first young lady, all of which I found at least mildly suspicious.

On the other hand, I had no serious complaint about the actual treatment. There was the usual unnecessary medical stuff, such as weight and height and blood pressure--I had come in because I had gotten something in my eye, it felt as thought it was still there the next day, and I wanted someone to look at it. I was then looked at by a nurse who seemed entirely competent, looked over the eye, found nothing substantial, thought there was probably a slight abrasion that she couldn't see (given my feeling as though something was still there). She prescribed some ointment for my eye.

My three stars reflect my satisfaction with the treatment by the nurse but my concern with the attempt to get my credit card with no explanation of why.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Very good experience first time there.  You can make online appointments online for the next day if you wake up in pain in middle of night. I made appointment for 9:30am next day.  Not very far
from my house. Nice place. Got in right away. Everyone very nice and capable. Doctor was good and confirmed what I expected to hear, but
I needed to hear it from a doctor. Doctor spent enough time with me and was thorough. Got Prescription at my local pharmacy. I signed up to
have this be my primary care....didn't have one before. Been to other doctors with lots of people in waiting rooms, etc. May give 5 stars after
I've been there a few more times.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>Completely negligent and misdiagnosed. Went in for abdominal pain on Friday asking if it was diverticulitis and if antibiotics should be given. The doctor said it could not be that and to come in the following day for an ultrasound at another location. Went at 9 am the following morning and expressed the pain had increased. Was told that if it was an appendicitis the doctor would call immediately but usually it was a 24 hour turnaround. If the pain increased it was recommended to go to ER. Ended up in ER within a few hours to be diagnosed with diverticulitis.  I called Urgent Care and cancelled my Monday follow up appointment. 10 hours after my ultrasound appointment Urgent Care calls to inform me that I have an appendicitis and should go to the ER. If you have a urgent care need I would recommend not coming here. Waste of time and unnecessary pain, which could have been resolved on the first visit. They continue to call and ask how I am doing...are there no notes in the system and is no one communicating internally?  I have requested that they no longer contact me.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fcaacba30086d:0xd95efed7e7001673</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I read other reviews and it seemed like mornings were the best time to come in so I came right when they opened on Saturday.Very clean and friendly staff. I like how spacious this place is (I'm a design nerd, so really appreciated the space). My provider was Tran (?). She was very friendly, professional, and easy to talk to. I was in and out pretty quick and got my prescription at Target (located in the same plaza), super convenient. I've just have had really good experiences with Action.< /text>

The Action Urgent Care staff was able to get me in right away and they were super helpful and friendly.  It was so nice to go into a medial facility that was warm in nature instead of stuffy and arrogant like so many other medical facilities often are.  I highly recommend this location, the staff, and Dr. Ganna.</text>

<Gmap_id>0x808fcaacba30086d:0xd95efed7e7001673< /Gmap_id><text>I pre-scheduled a follow up appointment in case it was needed. It wasn't, so I called more than a day in advance to cancel the appointment, as I was instructed.  I spoke to a human being that confirmed to me that I was canceling.

On the evening of the previously scheduled appointment, I got a phone call telling me that I missed the appointment (that I had canceled) and would be charged a $50 fee.  The calling office could not resolve the issue, so I was referred to billing.  The rep I spoke to could also not resolve the issue as there was no supervisor available.

So at this point, I am spending time fighting a fee that is entirely their error, but they lack the customer service capacity to correct their mistake.

I have the call logs on my phone from when I canceled, so I have a paper trail of my own efforts.  They have nothing.  I will continue to fight this spurious charge, and I will NEVER, EVER return.  I was a first and now last time customer.

Steer clear - this operation is strictly amateur hour.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The relatively new check in staff person would not let me fill out the intake information with my information & medical history, until he got approval from the insurance carrier.  Unlike other urgent  care  offices, they did not highlight the parts of the paper form that I needed to fill out ahead of time. It took an hour just to check in right when they opened.  The whole visit took 2 & 1/2 hours. To make matters worse, the Nurse Practitioner did not provide the supervising physician's DEA number, so the pharmacist at CVS could not fill the prescription.  It took 3 & 1/2 hours total just to fill a prescription for an antibiotic that I already knew that I needed for an infected elbow that caused bursitis. Go to Sutter Urgent Care or elsewhere instead.< /text>

<Time>1484102576895<//Time><text>Straight forward process and friendly nurses and doctors. The bathroom and waiting area was squeaky clean and spacious. The location was convenient and the building was easy to find. They picked up the phone right away and my questions were answered concisely and nicely when I first called in to make sure they would accept my insurance. The paperwork and billing process was efficient and easy. After my visit,  I was sent on my way with a prescription for antibiotics and some much needed pain killer. This clinic is great!

The only reason this review isn't five stars is the initial wait time. I had to wait for about an hour to be seen this Tuesday morning even though there was only one other person in the waiting room when I arrived. To be fair, I have never gotten in and out of any medical appointment quickly anywhere even when I was scheduled unless we are talking about my primary care physician. In this case, I was a walk in so I guess you have to somewhat expect this and be patient. (No pun intended!)

Once I was taken back to have my vitals checked, review my medical history, and see the doctor, they got me in and out within 30 minutes. They were probably just slightly understaffed. I would still highly recommend this place to anyone I know! The staff here were great even if I had to wait a little while. :-)< /text><user_name>Abigail McBride< /user_name>< Rate>

They didn't return my test results, didn't return my calls. However they billed my insurance 2 months later. Waste of time and money.< /Review>

Giving one star for the following two reasons:
1. Wrong med was sent to pharmacy.  When I called to tell them that they prescribed the wrong med they told me I can use the prescribed UTI cream for a burn on my finger.  WHAT!! Why would I do that and why not give me the right burn cream.  Wasted half the day to get the right medicine.
2.  Nurse wanted to unnecessarily give me a tetanus shot even though my previous one was 9 years ago and they are good for 10 years.<//review>

<text>I've never felt so undervalued as a human as when I went in here.

No one senior to the receptionist would speak to me. The receptionist was told to turn me away and give me a phone number to call.

You should never support a medical establishment that refuses to even see a sick person: it's like saying some people shouldn't receive medical attention. It's part of embodying the oath you vow when you become a doctor.

PS they just opened and were hanging out right around the corner. You could hear the disinterest and contempt in her voice. **shivers**<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Really great service. I was struggling getting an appointment with my PCP and was able to get seen within 10 minutes of arrival. I was in and out in 20 minutes. It took longer for me to fill out paper work than it did for me to wait for the doctor to come in. It looked like they could do more than a normal doctor's office can do. I noticed X-rays, and a Lab room, and I believe they said something about ultrasound. Either way, they have an amazing, clean, and beautiful facility. The staff from reception to doctor was friendly and professional. Great experience guys!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Action Urgent Care is an awesome place where you can get your treatment in emergency without spending more money. Staffs and doctors are really helpful and caring.
Thanks my friend Santawna for recommending AUC. Even the lady who was doing ultrasound in Hamilton campus is superb. You can really depend on them when you have been suffering  from a disease and get emergency treatment.</Text>

While on an extended stay with my 85 year old parents I contracted cellulitis. I choose Action urgent care because if it's close proximity to my folks home. I had an appointment in less than a minute and it was for scheduled for 2 hours later ! Very impressive and the staff and attending physician were professional and considerate and knowledgeable. Had I not needed a tetnus shot my entire visit would have been concluded in under 25 minutes. If you are in need of medical treatment I highly recommend Action Urgent Care. You won't be dissapointed!< /Review>

There was a tv on the wall  showing patient names and  the order of who was next.  I liked that.  I liked this Urgent Care so much I am making

Don't go to urgent care if you have to.  Be aware of extra charges such as weekend fee, medicine counseling etc.  Your insurance won't cover these fees and you have to pay yourself.  Follow up is a scam.<//text>

Have a lot of health problems and they have been right on top of all my concerns. Your not waiting forever to be seen and the doctors spend quality time going over your health issues. all I can say if it's not a life threatening emergency then find an Action Care Clinic near you before running to the hospital or the ER. Unfortunately for medic-cal   patients they do not accept that insurance. You would have to pay out of your own pocket, otherwise I would dump all those scvmc docs and that very overwhelming hospital that take care of  the rest of my family and have them seen at ACTION CARE.</review>< Pics>

The suggestion was taken. I am grateful to ActionUrgentCare for helping me and for sending me for more complete help.
I’ve been to one other urgent care facility while on vacation on Cape Cod,MA.  It was most helpful - giving me idea to try ActionUrgentCare who did not disappoint at all.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fcaacba30086d:0xd95efed7e7001673<//GmapID></record>

<Review>The nurse was exceptional, informative, caring, helpful and knowledgeable.  Do not be put off by the "virtual" physician.  You sit face to face with a large screen and I felt like the doctor could see and feel my pain through the computer.  Unless you have some unique illness, the nurse and doctor at another location solved the problem!!< /Review>< user>

< Review>
Came into town on a plane with double ear infections.  They got me in and got antibiotics called in immediately, even helping to talk directly with a pharmacy before they closed for the night.  Stephanie, the girl at the front desk went above and beyond her duties to help me.  I highly recommend.< /Review>

I still have to contact billing because the receipt they gave me not work for FSA and took them 4 times at initial visit to charge the card correctly.  I work with healthcare workers,  I would expect a lot more but clearly I was wrong.< /review><Rating>3</Rating><pics>None</pics><UserId.>102546246649346918162</UserId.>< response>

This clinic is very convenient because it is open 7 days a week. There is practically no waiting more than 10 minutes to see a Doctor. This staff is extremely nice and helpful.< /text>

Terrible experience here. Walked in with an abscess I needed to get drained. Was charged $220 for a co-pay although I have health insurance, had to wait over an hour in the patient room despite having an appointment and showing up on time, and once I finally spoke to the doctor she shyed away from draining my abscess despite multiple requests, and would only prescribe antibiotics. Antibiotics did nothing and my abscess grew larger. 2 days later I went to Sutter Health urgent care where I had a minimal wait time, payed a $25 co-pay, and had the abscess drained immediately. The doctor at Sutter Health also told me that I was prescribed the incorrect antibiotics for the abscess. Don’t waste your time/money with this place and go to a professional facility.<//Review>

I called in advance to verify that I could complete my visit on my lunch break and was told there were no patients at that time. I completed my visit in about 40 minutes and returned to work on time.

I was seen by PA Ganna Baetge is simply amazing!! She's smart and quickly dismissed my health concerns. Her bedside manner was wonderfully caring. I was in and out in 30 minutes.

Waited for 45 minutes to have a Skype chat with a Resident Nurse who told me everything seemed fine. How would she know through a digital video what my lungs feel like? I was never told I would be having a silly Skype conference and I never saw a licensed doctor at all. If I wanted to video chat with a nurse I would have stayed home and used my laptop instead of wasting my time. I'm still sick and was not prescribed proper treatment. Do not go there if you want to see a real MD physician.</text>

I am a patient of doctor Ganna Kuvaldin for several years . According to my experience she is the beautiful doctor and great person and I recommend her to everybody who needs either  urgent, or regular medical service or both.

I have asked the reception to leave a note for it and sent 2 emails to the billing department to chase on that.

I do suggest you to think about it before go to this clinic if you plan to claim the expense.< /text><Rating>1< /Rating>< Date>

I came to Action Urgent Care before they closed at 9pm. The door was locked but I shook the door handle and looked in. The receptionist saw me at the door and decided to walk into another room without giving me any sign or communication of any sort. I waited 10 minutes hoping they were perhaps just leaving the front desk to come to the door or they were checking to see if the was doctor available. For someone working in healthcare it is extremely unprofessional and absolutely inexcusable of them to see a patient at the front door of a clinic and ignore them.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I had a PCR test to return to Japan.
The reservation, inspection, and results were very smooth.
We inspected at 9:30 and got results around 20:00.
It was very helpful. Thank you!

This place is terrific. I came in today and was very scared of my senior photo, but the women were really supportive and polite. She made me feel at ease. I definitely recommend this place to you .<//Review>

{'time': 1591838400951, 'text': 'I am sorry that this happened to you.  We have measures in place to avoid such issues.  We sent the school a poster to display on campus, they are supposed to promote that all seniors look at the poster and make sure that their image is displayed and that it is the correct image.  With all of the issues that happened this year, I expect that the poster was not displayed or that the seniors may not have been informed to look at the poster.  This has rarely happened in previous years and am very sorry that it happened to you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Pratt'}< /resp>

I had a great experience here while taking my senior portraits and received incredible custom service from all the staff here. However my 2 star rating is due to the fact that whoever was in charge of sending my picture to my school for yearbook and this years virtual graduation did not send in my photo and a
number of other students’ photos as well. The whole point of getting the picture taken is to be displayed in the yearbook. On top of an already terrible senior year, this was the icing on the cake.<//Text>

JP Impression was one of the best photo studios I've ever been to. The people were really friendly and funny. The waiting time wasn't that bad and I wouldn't want to take my senior portraits at any other place.< /review>

This place is way over priced- I'll managed and professional.  If there is a better way to obtain senior photos on your own make sure you skip these rip off scammers 'trump-ish tactics ' saying enough?<//Review>

<Review>Awesome delivery of photos for our wedding! Priceless, even as I look back at them from 2009 at the Fairmont where we got married. Would not have done anything different!!!  All I can say is the picture album is ★Amazing★!</Review><user>102320143054557927472< /user>< Date>

<Response>{'time': 1556062359210, 'text': 'Interesting comment.  First of all you are a 5th grade student, I understand that you have an opinion that is valid.  If you or your parents did not like the photo that was captured six months ago you could have had retakes taken for free.  Your parents paid for a package J which $52.17 plus sales tax of $4.83 for a total sale of $57.00.  The package includes 3-8x10s, 2-5x7s, 2-4x5s and 4 wallets.  You look great with a nice smile and quite a few freckles.  I have yet to meet an African American with freckles, though I am sure there may be some.  When you do the math of $52.17 divided by 9 photos each print purchased was $5.80 each.  I think the facts stated help you to understand things a little better.  If you so desire I will be contacting your parents and ask them if they want you to have a free retake session.  Yes we get cheesy for school pictures to help the students relax and have a real smile.'}< /Response>< gmapID>

<username>Joseph Jackson<//username><Time>1609060985981<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>The lunch buffet is awesome! It is worth the limited parking and seating. I love the eggplant and the chicken! The chicken was tender. The beef meats are also good as is bolani which I thought I would like more but the chicken and the eggplant stole the show! The rice, salad and bread also very good accompaniments. You have a choice of hot tea, lemonade, and soda - diet coke. The desserts are simple butter cookies and sliced loaf - what seemed like lemon pound cake. I wish they had ice cream now that the weather is getting warmer! Ha wishful thinking.

We were so glad we came! The food was freshly replaced and kept warm. This is our new lunch date spot when we're in the area! The owner is friendly and remembers us, and a man had motioned for us to take his parking as he was leaving. The other patrons very nice too, making way for me to pass and get through. Bus your silverware and drinking glass and your disposables in the garbage.< /text>< pics>

A family run diner and afghan market which has been around for many years. Was pleased to chance upon it.

The Chapli kebabs were out of this world - soft and fresh with the right amount of crispiness. Served with white rice and a small piece of afghan bread. I’ve not had such good kebabs even in NYC or Queens.

The afghan pulao was nice - a bit too sweet for my liking but I loved the huge bone of lamb served with it. The meat was tender, flavorful and just falling off the bone.

Both dishes came with a side of nan, salad, yogurt and green chutney. I wish the yogurt was served in a separate container. I think the prices were reasonable. We got takeout so couldn’t enjoy the ambience of the place. But hope to be back soon.

The place is halal. Quick service.<//Text>

My favorite afghan restaurant in the area. This is a market/Afghani restaurant. The chicken kebab here is among the best in the bay area. They also have a lunch buffet on weekdays. It's really excellent and cheap compared to the other buffets in the area. This is truly a hidden gem.</text>

Great place for Afghan/Pakistani/Indian groceries. Don't look for anything past general, you won't find it. They Bake the best bread you can't find in many zip codes surrounding this neighborhood. They also have an Afghan restaurant adjacent to the store, while I have never eaten there, I'm sure the food is as good as the bread.</Text>

<text>Absolutely the best Afghan food in town. This place has been a regular for us for weeknights and weekends, as well as quick catering for small parties. Their menu is simple, but every item they make is amazing. Kabobs are tender and juicy. Rice is always aromatic and on point. Every item on their dish seems to be prepared fresh. Take-outs are always hot and delicious. The kids love the food as well because it isn’t spicy, but full of flavor. The salad is a favorite with them. We’d be lost without Maiwand!< /text>< Rating>

I was with my husband on this occasion. This is a small restaurant that serves some of the best Indian dishes. I like the rice and curried chicken, or it's some spicy seasoning. My husband love this place and if it is a delicious  Indian cuisine this is a quick stop because it's so near to where we live and of course the food is yummy.< /Review>

They have the worst customer service.  The lady is extremely rude.  They raised their prices and didn’t update the menu, so ordering food they don’t say the significant increase and charge more when you show up to pick up order. Such a rip off and no courtesy either to honor the menu prices.
Honestly their food is not worth the increase in the price.  Medina kabob on In Santa Clara is much better.< /text>

It's a nice, convenience store / grocery store with some quick Buffet option during the lunch hours. Stuff is nice and it's decently clean place as well. I'm glad I was able to check it out since I went out there with my friends.<//review>

They don’t have a restroom. Restaurant is so small. Lack of personal, there is just one lady who is working really hard and apparently doing multiple tasks and it takes so long sometimes for to reach to everyone in the restaurant. They need to do more work on the cleanness of the restaurant itself. The food is really good and delicious. I appreciate the hard work of the Maxican lady at the restaurant.<//Review>

The most delicious food. The chicken melts in your mouth as well as the rice and they serve the most generous portions for the price. The koobideh and beef is seasoned perfectly and so juicy and tender but zero fat. Afghan food is phenomenal. Its so balanced and the salads are so good! I love the amount of red onions too. I will be coming here basically til i die and hope they stay around for a really long time< /text>

Great value. $13 for all you can eat. Always have keftah kabob and a beef and a chicken entree. Great kesra flat bread. Usually some kind of rice and a vegetarian side dish or two. Somewhat pedestrian green salad. But what a deal! Closed during daylight hours during Ramadan.</text>

The grocery sells rotten food.  When I tried to return the package, the owner said that they don’t accept the opened package!  How could someone find out the food has gone bad without opening the package?!!! They said that I need to call the company, Golchin, who distributes rotten food to the store!</review>

For the price, you get some moderately tasty, plentiful food with some nice tea to finish off.  I had the buffet and a take away from here.

Chapli Kebab is quite good here as is the rice.<//review>

The food is excellent and the owners are very hospitable. Its not a formal dining place, service would between a deli / restuarant setting. The host will check on the guests frequently but works in the kitchen. However, they are very friendly and welcoming.
Weekdays lunch buffet is good. Limited choice of meat, rice and vegetables dishes, but, quality and taste is good. You can also order from their regular menu. Once you eat here, you will return again and again.
The grocery store is right beside it where you get fresh meat and Afghani bread (the long flat bread). Both the grocery store and restaurant is owned by the same establishment.</text>

<time>1522858763805</time><rate>5</rate><Review>I was willing to try this place because I liked their store in Fremont. Authentic Chaply kabab, can be made spicy or mild. Delicious food. I thought I would not like the whole wheat Bolani but it is out of this world! I would  skip buying burgers or wraps as it seemed bland to me. Service is slow but the area is clean. Try their freshly made Afghan bread. Lots of authentic cultural grocery and gift items.<//Review>< pics>

The buffet is ok when it’s full.
Which’s not always the case.
I gave this place lots of chances..
but the restaurant itself is dirty, anything you touches is sticky including salt & paper shakers etc
Lots of items were messing. No forks no dessert no tea bags etc even though " they are included in buffet price"
I’ll never comeback :(<//text>

<review>I wanted to seat and order from the menu but was told it’s either take out or the buffet during lunch hour so I had no choice but the buffet....the Kabob was cold the chicken Kabob was all gone, salad bowl was empty and some rice was left over on the tray...I guess the  steemer self service Warmer is not keeping the food hot enough at the buffet table!

I hate to give less then 4 stars but there buffet needs some improvements so until then , 3 star is wat it deserves!!</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Afghan cuisine ( Janati Khoraka Ast ) means Heaven Food on Earth. I like the traditional food Qabili Palaw ( Rice,  Lamb , carrots and raisins ).
Try once, u will like to come back again and again.
Enjoy....< /Text>

The lady is super rude, the other day I bought something I need something else too but when I asked her she didn’t even answer my question and in the end I said thanks she she didn’t even responded and the other thing is they will charge you 75 cents for no reason.....<//review>

<review>I had my best customer service experience in recent memory at Site for Sore Eyes in downtown Berkeley! Tino was so helpful, knowledgeable, able to answer all my questions, and stayed late after the store closed to help me call my insurance company to make sure I knew all my options for paying for prescription sunglasses. The glasses were ready on time and he was there when I picked them up; he made sure they fit perfectly. I will absolutely be back to do my next eye exam and order contacts/glasses from this location.</review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Site For Sore Eyes is absolutely Outstanding!  Yes, they have really cool styles (I found at least 6 pair I Loved - which doesn't ever happen) and every name brand that would make a eyeglass aficionado feel like they won the lottery. But it is the exemplary staff that has won my loyalty - for life. The moment I walked in, Grace's open smile along  with her graciousness immediately made me feel at ease. Ernesto heard my problem as well, and stepped into action, enlisting Tino, the Hero. Tino is an artist with a firm grasp of physics, their expert technician. You see, I wasn't there for eye glasses this time. I had accidentally stepped on my favorite, and yes, chichi expensive sunglasses - and for me, it felt dire; with light colored eyes, I literally cannot see in the sun thus spend $$$$ on good sunglasses. Two other places said: they are not fixable. Tino did the impossible with Grace and Ernesto adding their support. They saved me. 11 Stars***********</text>< pictures>

Occasionally the prices have been a little high and sometimes the selection has not been great, but all of the walk-in places I have been to have these same sorts of issues. This place, however, has been among the best and I am very happy with them over-all. Please keep up the great service!<//Review>< gmap_id>

Excellent and easy to access.  One of the things I love about this place is they provide services to low income people in the community through New Eyes for the Needy.  It requires a case manager to access it but once you have that its easy and free for a pair of glasses.   I get my contacts here and have always been impressed with how helpful people are.< /text>

I've been going there now for a couple years and I've been happy the biggest thing for me is I can just walk in and they're pretty good about making next day appointments are the same day appointment but keep in mind if you're trying to make an appointment for the same day or if you just walked in you might have to wait a little bit which should be common sense so yes I would recommend this place</Text>

I paid for an exam. That went well. I bought a pair of glasses (titanium) which were nice and lightweight. The selling point was when the salesman bent and twisted the glasses and said that the frames were pretty much indestructible. I also took advantage of a "free" frame...I ended up paying about $80 because of the bells and whistles (high index, which they weren't really cause they were really heavy, and darkened so they could be my sunglasses). I purchased the extended warranty on the free pair cause I wasn't sure of the quality of the frames. I did not purchase it for the titanium ones...well, cause they were suppose to be indestructible. Here's why I'm giving it a low rating. Just a few months afterwards, the titanium frames broke, right at the bridge. I came in and asked if they could be replaced...I figured everything (unless they are free) should come with at least a manufacturers warranty (every other optometrist I've purchased frames from has stood behind their products). They said that since I did not purchase the protection on those frames, they couldn't help me. Really? So I went and bought some super glue, and glued the frame at the nose together. They could've tried and helped repair my relatively new glasses, don't you think? Anyway, relatively inexpensive they were; but they failed at customer service.</Text>

DO NOT ENTER THIS PLACE unless you are looking to waste your time with the most incompetent group of people imaginable. I want to put zero stars but that is not possible so I'm being way too generous already with the one.

I came here only because this gave me the fastest appointment. Now I know why. As soon as I entered I was greeted by a lady whose name is Tyra (something like that) who had a piece of paper that my insurance had faxed her but who did not know how to read it. When I prompted her, she rudely said that she was going to lunch. I waited for an hour for my appointment that was meant to be at 4, which she had recorded as 4.30 - I did not see the optometrist until 5.

The rest of the time I was dealing with this lady and her other colleague known as Grace and yet another colleague known as Andrew. Andrew yapped for a long time about politics instead of taking care of my concerns regarding my insurance. I don't mind a great politics conversation but not when I am at a place to get my eyes checked and under time pressure.

The ONLY redeeming quality about this place is the doctor. He was very painstaking, which can also be taken for as VERY slow. But I left satisfied knowing that he had answered every question I had.

Overall though, save yourself the headache from this place where people lose papers, have no idea how to organize basic things, are constantly blaming you and others. I have never been in a less professional environment. So if you do need to go here because there is no other place that satisfies your needs, be mentally prepared for a lot of incompetence.< /Review>

<review>I had lost my contacts AND glasses one morning, and I called Site for Sore eyes in an emergency. Lucky for me they were able to see me right away. The optometrist was very friendly and answered all the questions I sprang at her and she even recommended comfortable lenses unlike the dingy ones I had been ordering for years (-_-). highly recommend this place if you don't care about appearances and just want the gift of sight lol --- prices are low compared to Cohens and other similar places< /review>< Pictures>

I was very pleased with the quality of service and choice of frames at Site for Sore Eyes in Berkeley when I purchased new glasses this past summer.  It was also a great benefit to receive a substantial discount, as I don't have vision insurance.  My husband will be getting his eye exam and new glasses later this month at your store.</Review>

Despite the other reviews, the people at this establishment were very good to me, both the doctor and staff, and I love my glasses. The prices and people were great. I also like that the doctor talked to me like I was an educated adult, which many doctors don't.< /Review>

What began as a great in-store experience became the worst customer experience I've ever had, to the tune of $400 of mine in their pockets without my purchase nor MY OWN PROPERTY RETURNED TO ME. I ordered a new frame with new lenses, and gave them one of my frames to put in new lenses. They were promised to me by Tuesday, and when they weren't ready and I was flying home for the the holidays, this store sent them in the mail. Their bad, they only insured them for $50, and I never received them. Now they refuse to refund my money, refuse to replace my own property, and I have no transition lenses, and am getting headaches everyday outside, having to choose between sunglasses and no glasses, or my glasses and glaring sun. A woman named Grace who works there was an angel who was very very helpful. Everytime anyone else answers the phone, they say, "the boss is actually quite busy" explaining why he won't talk to me. I filed with the BBB, and the case was closed because this office never responded.<//review>

They will rip you off if you’re not careful.

I came here for an eye exam and to order contacts because I needed a same day Saturday appt and they accept my insurance. The salespeople and optometrist were very nice. The eye exam was reasonably priced I think. But glasses and contacts are a total rip off. I didn’t do my research beforehand because I was in a rush and didn’t remember how much like car shopping a contact lens purchase can be...

First they quoted me $179 to replace the lenses in my glasses. I declined that offer because I know that Warby Parker does that for $50.

Then they charged me $50/box for contacts. I didn’t know how much of a rip off that was until I went home and looked up prices online. I called the store and let them know that I wanted to cancel my order because I found a better deal. Right away they said they could discount my price to $35/box. I took the deal but will just purchase online in the future.

Make sure you negotiate if you purchase anything here. Or just save your money and go to Warby Parker and buy contacts online.</Review>

<Text>Sheesh. Over two and a half years ago I bought glasses there. After a year, I got new glasses at another local place. (That should tell you something.)

But here’s the thing: the sight for sore eyes people have been bugging me for 42 months to leave them a review! Unsubscribe? Lol. (Of course I tried that.)

I swear I get the feeling they send so many GD emails to continue the degradation of my eyes.

Anyway, here’s the review: You come in. They help you. You get a obligatory eye exam. You get pressured into upgrading. (God forbid if you opt for contact lenses, lol.) You pay. You get out. You wait three weeks. You get your glasses. You get AT LEAST 42 emails from them to review them. You go through two different sets of eye glasses from a different and better eye glass store. You finally give in. You leave a review. (Feel free to COPY AND PASTE.)

They did their job. I gave them money. They didn’t suck. Two ⭐️ ⭐️...please stop harassing me.

You got your review. I’ll go ahead and Yelp this as well.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Should have trusted my intuition when looking around the shop. This shop is too sloppy for an eyeglasses shop.  How could them make me look good when they don't look good?

My experience was horrible.  They billed my HSA before the frames came in. Then said the frames are no longer available, but they will not give me a refund but want me to buy a different pair.  They checked my insurance before the eye exam, but now said insurance won't pay and I owe them more money.  I am following up with them and with my insurance based on these unfair practices. If you go there, I hope your experience is better.<//text>< Pictures>

Tino, a real optician and mgr at sore eyes helped me find two pairs of enhanced size glasses with poly carb lenses at an exceptionally great value! Although I came in at the end of the day he stayed late to make sure I got my glasses in an hour. His kind service, knowledge and dedication was the best I have seen anywhere in the Bay! They definitely get my business in the future!  Once again thsnk you very much! Sincerely Langston😉</review>

< review>
I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses during the 2 for 1 sale. I found the person at the shop on Shattuck quite patient as I tried probably 60 pair of glasses- and I found a frame I really liked- of course, it was the ore expensive one at $400 or so and the "free" pair- which I used for sunglasses was from a small shelf across the aisle that looked like a drop off from Goodwill...

The graded bifocal lens I got was clear and I could see more clearly than a cheaper pair I got at costco in a previous year that cut off the bottom half of my perscription.

but, when asked about the "anti glare" coating (so many upsells) I said no- but I did want the scratch proof coating-

now, this pair of glasses (and I am 50 having worn glasses since 4th grade) scratches more easily than any other pair I have ever owned. I brought them back and they claim there was the scratch proof coating- I brought them to UC Berkeley where my daughter is covered and asked them to check- they said most certainly no scratchproof coating- another optomitrist on Solano verified-

but sore eyes will do nothing- they claim it is on there- it most certainly is not as I did not change the way I clean glasses and have worn them for many years. as they are pretty scratched- not big scratches but alot of little ones that makes the lens look like frosted glass in the middle- I can not see to read or do anything that requires focus-

so- they are a great low cost place but with add ons and such- you are better off going to someone who backs their product- I will not purchase from them again given the state of my glasses 5 months later ...< /review>

Worst experience ever!!
Worst customer service!!
I wouldn't recommend this shop to my enemy!

i bought prescribed eye glasses for computer purposes. And I was not comfortable with the glasses they gave me so I went to my doctor to check what was wrong and he said the glasses are not made as per the prescription. Then I went back to them and told them that the eyeglasses are not made as to the prescription and I wanted a redo. Surprisingly they asked me to pay again for the redo even though it is they who messed my eye glasses up. And they lied to me that blue light coding was added in to my glasses but when my doctor checked it there was none.

I wouldn't recommend this shop to my enemy.<//review>

<Text>DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS. Very sloppy, rude customer service. Cheap AND dishonest.

I bought glasses here that came with a scratch on one of the lenses. I went in to pick up my glasses and they could not find the glasses at all.  After looking for 10 minutes or so they finally found them, with the scratch. The owner (Paul) told me he would immediately order a new lense but that I could take them away to use in the meanwhile. But apparently he forgot all about it and forgot to note the date I picked up the glasses in their records or that their was a defect they were going to fix...

.... One year later still waiting for them to replace my lense. I finally went in to get the lense replaced. The owner denies ever telling me that he would replace the lense but now says that if I BUY one new lense (at full cost) he will replace the defective lense. He basically said I was making it all up and blaming me for not insisting that they do what they were supposed to do-- order me a new lense and then call me when it was ready.

In addition, they refuse now to honor the one year scratch warranty. I originally ordered the lenses a year ago on October 5. I picked them up a couple of weeks later.  But they did not give me any paperwork on the pick up and now because the owner neglected to make a note in their records that I had even picked up the glasses they are claiming October 5 warranty expiration.

These people are cheap, rude, sloppy and dishonest.</Text>< pics>

Very bad experience, although a good eye doctor.

Billed my insurance for a frame before I actually agreed to pay for it and before I got the final price!!! How can you bill the insurance before you actually get the price?? Does it make sense?!< /review>

<Text>These guys are the worst.  They broke a pair of glasses and then charged me for the frames.  THEY BROKE THEM AND CHARGED ME!  If you are stupid enough to go here, don't give them your credit card.  Pay in cash, wear a disguise and give a false name.

Love my girls, here! I have the subway app (GET IT. SAVES YOU TIME AND THEM A HEADACHE!) I'm always welcomed with a smile, and since I work down the road, I'm here often. Clean dining room, I'm never shorted on anything, good customer service, and I hear good things about the manager at this franchise location! That's always a plus.</review>

<Review>Popular because of the constant traffic. Friendly & knowledgeable staff. No wasted steps in prepping my sandwiches. Server made sure to mark one of the two sandwiches so I knew which one was which.

Good looking sandwich. Not overly impressed with taste of sandwich though, and it was no falt of the servers. Food quality is all Subway corporate food prep.

I would recommend this Subway though because of convience of having one in town and their variety of sandwiches offered.</Review>< user_id>

<review>Just did an online order and went to pick up at 8:20 due to getting off late and not wanting to eat late. I paid an extra $1 for pepporoni to be put on one of the sandwiches. I got home and realized they forgot to put it on there. Instead of driving down there and asking for a refund due to their mistake and them about to close I tried calling. They not only let the phone ring over and over once but TWICE. wasn't a big deal to me I know it's just a dollar but to not answer the phone when I just left the store and got home within 10 mins is rude. Will be trying to call tomorrow to get refunded. RIDICULOUS!<//review>< Rate>

Well you have to start off by realizing this is Ridgecrest! It's on us-395 somewhere between nowhere and somewhere. But it is a long way to any other dog parks so it is nice to have this break if you're heading up 395. The park is well fenced there are a lot of big shade trees the only real concern I would warn you about is that it doesn't appear in Ridgecrest that you were required to pick up your dog's poop if it's anywhere near a fence. So the perimeter of the park is lined with biological landmines. But it has grass, and it is in the middle of nowhere. So this part is definitely a 4 or a little above star<//review>

<Review>Friendly people, so far.  Lots of space for the dogs to play. Small and large dog areas. There seems to be a place to put out water, but there are no fountains to fill a bowl. Plenty of potty bags...some folks don't know how to use them though, so watch out for random poop-piles.<//Review>< rating>

<Text>There is enough space for the dogs to run. There is a clique of older people who come everyday to the small side and a clique of big dog people. They are nice but take up their same spots everyday and will end up pushing you out of the table by exclusion. There are some owners who think their dogs bad behaviors are cute and a few reactive small dogs who also dominate others with humps frequently.
The large needed side of full of Huskies with dominance issues who don't listen to commands. You can constantly hear them getting loud and their owners yelling at them as if the dogs are caring.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I was driving through town and stopped to let my little ones out. Ended up chatting with a few very welcoming locals and their well mannered pups.

There are poop bags and water for the doggies,  and ample seating for their people. Nice park.< /Text>

Well shaded with a water fountain for the dogs. Large area with plenty of room for running and playing. My only complaint is that the only trash receptacles are right by the gate so if your dog goes at the far end of the park you have to walk all the way across or hold on to your bag.< /review>

Great park.

One star off for the folks who bring their aggressive, ill mannered dogs and don't attempt to control them<//Text>

<Text>So me my son & nephew go into Jersey Mike's unaware that they were closing in 5 minutes, but the door to business was open for business I was told I could only pay with credit or debit that they could not accept cash because they closed ther register out already (before closing ) and that I was unable to order hot subs cuz they grill is closed...  So why are your doors  opened/unlocked if you are not able to adequately serve me every thing on your menu or accept my money ?</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I've always loved Jersey Mikes but I must say the online service could use some work. I called in an order, came in 15 minutes later to pick up and it wasn't ready. There were 8 people in line. All their sandwiches were made before they even started my order. I told my girlfriend when I got home. She mentioned that they did the same to her the last time we ordered there. So why order online if i can walk in and get it faster. We've never had this problem when we ordered from Santee before this store opened. The food was good as always, but we probably won't be ordering from here again.<//Text><Date>1599946464590< /Date><userid>104935870551445179459< /userid><Response>None<//Response><Name>Don G</Name><Pics>None</Pics><gmap_id>0x80d95700d2adfead:0xd0eb1e7f95274be7< /gmap_id><rate>3< /rate></record></dataset><record>

A great place for classic sandwhiches! The particular time I went they were slammed with lots of guests, and it was a clearly stressful moment for the workers time wise, however the team handled it well with grace, efficiency and positivity-Something that really impressed me having worked in service myself. Keep it up!< /Review>

There was a customer there behind me. Who was beyond rude to all the employees yelling at them omg them they where going in circles (they weren’t) said they where being rude. They weren’t.

I didn't really like this place and I didn't really dislike this place. Rocco's Pizza to me has better Subs then Jersey Mike's well I go back maybe if there's not a Rocco around or a super-sub around and yes I might go back to Jersey Mike's. But I wasn't real impressed by their sub sandwich.<//review>

I took a terrible fall walking out with my sandwotch and NO ONE was willing to help me...they completley ignored me! Very dissappointing...thinking of calling management about it. I spent 22 hours in the hospital and came out with a cast on my arm...so dissappointed!< /Text>

I don’t live in a gated apartment. The delivery driver said he didn’t have a gate access code. 3rd party delivery services suck. It’s not hard, but it seems to be so hard for these delivery drivers.< /review>

I have 1 star because there is no 0 star rating.  They have failed twice on 2 separate orders to deliver product purchased from Amazon. On the website it even stated delivered but it never was.  I filled out an email with all my info on Dynamic website about this and they never contacted me. Do not use their service.<//Review>

I have been waiting for my package for a few days now, says there was a failed attempt. I've never encountered any issues through amazon, this is the first time I have a "failed attempt." I have no idea when my package is arriving now. I called the customer service number and the man on the phone was unprofessional. I heard him heavy breathing on the phone for 30 seconds before he actually answered. He told me the 2nd attempt will be within 48 hours. To my luck they are closed on the weekends and this happened on a Thursday. It's very frustrating. I kind of want to cancel the order and reorder. Amazon shouldn't use this company.<//review>

<review>I ordered a Christmas gift on Amazon. It was supposed to be delivered by 9pm 12/24. I received an email saying it was delayed  to between 12/26-12/29. On 12/29 it was out for delivery. Then I got an email saying there was an attempted delivery and they would try again the next day. I called Dynamex regarding this attempted delivery and the man asked me if there was a gate code or something that would prevent the delivery person from dropping of the package. There is not, the location is a house on an open street in a non gated neighborhood. So there really was no attempt! The man I spoke with said sometimes the drivers just say they attempted but did not really even try! Wow! I asked him if he would contact this driver who said he attempted to call him out on his claim,  then have him actually go to the address and deliver the package. He said they couldn't do that because they follow a route. Really? I beg to differ! By the consistent poor reviews Amazon should ditch this company ASAP.<//review>< pics>

<Text>As others have said, they seem to have a hard time actually delivering a package. Even if it's to an address that receives packages almost daily. Last time they did this, I had spoken to Amazon customer service and the driver was supposed to call when they were at the gates. No call whatsoever. It's like these people are doing the minimum</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Dynamex drove right by our clearly marked and easy to find home and wrote off our Amazon delivery as “wrong address, can’t deliver.” The same address we’ve used on all the hundreds of successfully delivered Amazon packages we’ve received this year alone. Calls to Dynamax go unanswered until the phone hangs up, or they hang up themselves. Even Amazon couldn’t get through to anyone.

There’s no sign they’re attempting the delivery again today as promised either. The package status shows no movement since yesterday, at 4:33, when we were home and sitting in the front room with dogs who alert us every time the gate is opened. The gate was not opened, nobody tried to deliver a package. Nothing but a pop up “this address doesn’t exist” as the truck drove merrily past.

Don’t rely on this company for anything you want to actually reach its destination.< /review>

Made last minute order on Amazon for Christmas and it's due to arrive by 9pm tonight. It's now 7pm checked shipping and still says due by 9pm tonight but not yet out for delivery. Delivery by Dynamex... But based on my experience and reviews here I won't see the gifts tonight or until after Christmas.  Off to Target I go...< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Probably the worst delivery service in the United States. I've never had deliveries from this company arrive remotely on time. They use undocumented workers for their drivers and overwork their capacity. Amazon uses this company sometimes and it's always a disappointment seeing this business as your delivery service. I wish there was a way to opt out of them.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Terrible customer service and following instructions..I am on pins and needles when my packages are delivered with them. Unfortunately Amazon or the product seller used this company from time to time...and the customer has no control. They will say package is delivered but it may be left somewhere and taken. They know it cannot be tracked once it states delivered. I absolutely abhor this company's delivery service.<//Review>

Apparently this is a shipping company that does not ship or deliver. I can only assume they are hoping that you bought the package as a gift for them because they KEEP your packages. I have been tracking my package, for a over week and they have scanned the package out for delivery and everyday scan the package back as delayed when I am a mere 4 miles away!!! It is no more than a morning jog to my residence from their location, how can they not DELIVER???? I have filed a formal complaint with Amazon to NEVER USE THIS VENDOR AGAIN FOR MY ORDERS!!!! I would suggest you do the same.<//Review>

<Review>If I could give it 0 stars i would. Amazon stop using this company. Its reputation of package delivery on time fails Amazon's standards.. I ordered a package on the 30th. Amazon says it'll will deliver on the 31st. Well today is now the 3rd and no delivery. Dynamex said yesterday it was expected to deliver. 12 hrs later. No delivery.. The kickers is dynamex location is actually 5-10 Mns from the delivery location. And they won't let me cancel until after the 5th..bad bad delivery service< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>For some reason, Amazon used this company to deliver my package. Was promised a Friday delivery, did not get my package until the following Monday. The tracking number provided was useless, Amazons tracking stopped updating as of Saturday morning, leaving my package in  a state of limbo. This company (per their address) is a mere 12 miles from me, yet it took them literal days to get me a package, when the closest Amazon warehouse is about 60 miles from me, and they can deliver in a matter of hours. Absolutely abysmal.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Awful awful awful. Suddenly Amazon is using them. Every item they’ve delivered for the last week has been multiple days late. Latest driver was completely unprofessional, parked in my driveway thumping bass, left his car there for five minutes while he ran around delivering packages to other houses, and his incessant noise woke up my wife and kids from naps. What the actual f***.</review>

Dynamex is a poor excuse for a shipper.  They overpromise and underdeliver.  If you’re a seller on Amazon, do your customers a favor and choose UPS or USPS at least.  They lost my package and after many days I finally was given the option cancel the order.  Extremely frustrating to say the least.  They drive around in unmarked vehicles which seems unprofessional.  Perhaps they are saving costs by having staff drive their own vehicles?  Now I’m waiting on another package carried by Dynamex and hoping history doesn’t repeat itself with another lost package.<//Text>

<review>This company claims that they attempted to deliver my item and no one was home. Well in the middle of a Pandemic, EVERYONE is home and I have doorbell cameras. This is either a plain lie or they’ve gone to someone else’s home. I’ve complained to OfficeMax and was told they get many complaints, my question is - why does anyone continue to use them!!< /review>< rate>

<review>So far two packages.
First one okay, but came in a mini van and it sorta looked like a package theft but it was a delivery.
Second shipment is late, awful tracking information. Is one day late so far for second package. Looks like it's lost in system. All it says is shipment received.
Not where, or where it's going. Just that they received it.
This is not why I pay for prime shipping.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Another Amazon fail. Placed order BECAUSE Amazon said it would be delivered the next day and we were leaving home in three days. Within hours got a notice saying it had shipped and would be delivered by Dynamex the next day. It’s now day three and the latest update is still merely that it “has shipped.” So I wasn’t surprised to see the reviews here. You can add my single star.  I’m only sorry there isn’t a zero star option. Amazon really needs to dump this sorry a$$ outfit.

UPDATE: I called Amazon about the order, ended up cancelling it, and told them—both on the phone and in the post phone call review—that they really need to drop Dynamex as a courier.< /Text>

7 orders supposed to be delivered by Dynamex. All 7 orders screwed up and either delayed by several days or cancelled all together. I'm just going to start cancelling orders if I see that Dynamex is the delivery agent. How are these guys still even in business?< /Review>

Ordered 3 packages and for some reason Dynamex had to pick up my package.  I ordered it on a Monday and it is the next day package and I got the notification from amazon that it was now lost 😭<//Review>

They’ve had my next day air package for a total of 4 days so far. Each day it’s marked “out for delivery” but they never actually bring it.</text>

<Text>I ordered off Amazon and they always deliver on time but when Dynamex is delivering its always "couldn't access" when other delivery services can access, i have a delivery the day before with no problems, i am surprised that amazon contracts with incompetent companies like this one, disappointing< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>DYNAMEX was late in a recent delivery from Amazon dot bomb. In another this week I was told by Amazon customer Service another package was lost. As with the Bungling Bumbling Post Office DYNAMEX can't be trusted to deliver parcels on time or at all. I have complained to Amazon about both and have seen no improvement.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c335573271f1a1:0x7f8f50271a543f8c</gmapID></record>

Worst shipping company ever,will never order from anyone who uses them ever again. They have never once delivered without constantly delaying the delivery & keeping customer in the dark,worse yet they're a strictly 1 day service.< /Text>

<review>They "ATTEMPTED" to deliver my package twice today and both times they arrived at the gate and immediately left! I seen him the second time, by the time I went and got my keys to open the gate they had left already, not to mention someone was coming in AND THEY still left! They don't care about delivering packages! I don't ever want a package delivered by them again!< /review>< Rate>

Worst customer service.... Guy who answered the phone was terrible and when I was trying to ask him a question he automatically placed me on hold. Honestly, I have no clue how these delivery companies are in business.

Than he hung up on me.</Text>

The food is great, I haven't had anything bad here yet. And you can't really argue with their beer selection, whether you're craving a hazy IPA or a farmhouse ale, this place won't disappoint!</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Great beers, great service, and food quality was good! Notably the entirely mobile ordering style was very refreshing. My only complaint was relatively small portion size (value) for the money.</Text>

I suspect it's the location, I drive/ride by Mission and 13th all the time and just didn't see it. Don't let this fool you - It's a very cool place to hang out and the staff is super friendly. Came here last weekend with a few friends after our lunch so didn't get to try their food. Will def come back next time and check it out.< /review><Time>1618953698538<//Time>< Rating>

Incredibly good people with a fantastic selection of rotating taps and delicious food. And you can buy 4-packs for the road. What's not to like? I would rarely choose to have a beer out when I can pick something up and drink at home, but the Crafty Fox is the exception.</Text>

They have a huge selection of hot dogs. I got the house dog with no mustard which was pretty good but next time I wouldn't add ketchup. Personally I think that the sauces overpower the taste of the hotdog. Also the fries are a little salty but over all this place is worth to try!<//Review>

<Text>I can't speak to the beer, though my husband enjoyed his. I had this Mac and cheese and it was outstanding, so rich and creamy and for a moment, it tasted as though the toasted bread crumbs was crumbled bacon.

I knocked a star because of the large volume of fruit flies hanging around. The windows were open, yes, but the fruit flies were around where we sat.<//Text>< pictures>

Great place with all types and flavors of draft beers. Very helpful staff that provides good advice on the different beers. There's a famous skatepark right around the corner so if you have kids who skate, you can enjoy a beer while they skate. That's what I call a win-win situation ;)</text>

Had the pleasure of having lunch at this lovely spot today. Service was great, the burger was damn good and since it's a gastro joint I took on one of their Czech largers from their abundant beer menu. It paired well with the food and was suggested by our bartender Jonny. My partner in crime had a chicken burger upon which he commented it tastes better than home! All in all a great spot to eat drink and just hang out if ya like. Highly recommend trying out this place. I know I'll be back.</review>

But this time I did I stopped he the tall one had a burger he always expects an exorbitant amount of food but this time it feels him up without going so close to the top and the fries were actually quite nice it was like going to your favorite bar in a small town. Though there's kitchen space seems quite confined it's truly a closet but the love and the passion in the food I guess it's worth the sacrifice for having only a space to just stand still and wiggle your toes thank you to the kitchen who put out beautiful food until the rude bartender I appreciate your civil pour was quite nice< /review>

Counter service food is heavy but well-executed. Fried chicken sandwich was actually not huge, and felt more balanced without the ranch dressing. Each table has a big bottle of tangy hot sauce and stack of napkins. I love that they have three different salad options.</Review>

For beer lovers you'll find yourself very pleased with the huge array of great drops to taste. From lagers to sours there's something for everyone. With a plethora of these coming from taps you know it'll be both cold and fresh. The snack and food menu is a great companion for the drink list. Excellent place to spend a few hours working your way through the menu.</review>

<Review>I was going to a concert next door and decided to get a bite to eat before the show started. The bartender was very accommodating, there was a great selection, and the food didn’t take long to come. I really didn’t expect much at first with a simple “fish and chips” plate, but this is literally the HIGHEST quality fish and chips with AWESOME flavor. I was literally amazed. Definitely going back!

Make sure to grab a drink meanwhile your food is being prepared. It’s a good appetizer.

P.s.: The only thing was the visual aspect of the dining area. It could really use some plants, or something of that nature.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Crafty Fox is THE best beer place in San Francisco for getting amazing local craft beer - especially the kind you can't find elsewhere. The staff are excellent, very friendly. There's lots of seating, which is great because it can be crowded sometimes, but often it is quite comfortable. They serve food as well, and it has always been good in my experience. This is one of our absolute favorite bars in the city.< /Text>

Bartender was fine, almost had a bit of an attitude where we should be waiting on him. Beer selection was really good, I didn’t eat but my buddy had a salad and the lobster roll and enjoyed it. Cool vibe, I dig the small bar section. Not the friendliest place, but not everywhere needs to be friendly I guess.< /Text>

This place is so great for any beer lover.  Over twenty rotating taps - it's a great place to discover new beers!  I get over there every few weeks or so and always find at least one new favorite - usually more!  Their food is pretty solid as well.  The bartenders are always friendly and helpful with what can be a bit of a daunting tap list.  This is one of my favorite spots in SF!<//Text>

There was no table service, but getting an order in at the bar was quick and easy.

Great beer selection and very knowledgeable and friendly staff.  I have to admit, I was not super impressed by the food, but I come to a place like this for the beer.  The only bummer is that their flights are pre-set and you cannot make substitutions.  Even so, the flights that they do offer are fairly well put together.  Would definitely return when back in San Francisco.</text>

<text>This is a great taproom in a sub-optimal location. They've created a really nice indoor-outdoor space with bar seating along an open window in the back, but the outdoors is right under the freeway, so it was a bit noisy and frenetic for my taste. But the beer is good, so maybe just accept that it's better indoors and choose a table closer to the back of the place. Definitely worth visiting.< /text>< pics>

When I've visited, it's usually been a little hard to find a (self-seat) table/bench, though I've always had a good time and really like the hybrid indoor/outdoor seating. The craft beer selection is large and fairly priced, and the food's pretty solid as well. I try to stop by any time I'm beer-bar-hopping in that area.</text>

<Review>Came on an afternoon and loved it! Bartender was lovely and handeled a busy crowd with ease, my beer was great and the food was awesome. The beer selection is solid and creative! Brought my husband here on a Saturday at 6pm after raving about it and it sucked:( Bartenders were well buzzed and continually toasting each other on their awesomeness. Weird techno music blaring and a total chaotic mess. I really can’t believe the difference in the vibe. Come during the week if you want to enjoy their great offerings minus the madness:)<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>It's my second favorite club, but owned by the people that started my first favorite club (Mighty)! They get consistently great DJs and people are there to dance. Much like Mighty, it's a large room. It also has a balcony area that's wide enough to dance on if the ground floor fills up. There's something about the sound dynamics of the place I can't quite identify. I use to call it an echo chamber, but I feel like they've come a long way with that. There's just something about the space that just doesn't completely jive with me. That being said, I do think they are a fine, fun club that puts up world class talent. They have professional security and bartenders and staff. And a clientele that is there to have fun and dance. Have Fun!</text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>The Crafty Fox offers amazing service, a wide craft beer selection and a delicious menu ranging from bar snacks to full dinner plates. The sausage board is delicious and large enough for two to share. The pate comes with grilled bread, pickles and a strong mustard. I've also had the fish and chips and butter beans. Both were outstanding. This is one of my favorite places in the city for both beer and food. It is a must visit.</review>< Pics>

Rotating beer selection on 25+ taps is phenomenal. Something for everyone, and plenty for a hardcore beer geek. Pub fare is good, though they seem to put jalapenos in everything.<//Review>

Had a couple of delicious beers - there was a pretty great range, from sours to hazy IPAs to stouts to saisons.. 30 odd beers on tap. Seemed like a really friendly crowd too.

Really fun atmosphere and great vibe. The beers were good and the food was pretty good, too. I wouldn’t write home about it but it was a good meal. The floor is like really, really sticky everywhere though.
There’s not a lot of seating but we managed to play a four person board game and have snacks and drinks without ruining everything for everyone else.<//Text>

Popped in here for a little Tuesday night fun. The food here was pricey but great. There is also a nice beer selection. My only qualm is that our service was excellent for the first half hour our visit and then when things got busy we had to wait about 45 minutes for our food AND our bartender stopped caring about refilling our drinks. The saving grace was how great our food was, would definitely try this place again.</text>

One of my favorite spots in the city to grab a drink. Great beer selection, friendly staff. Fried chicken sandwich and fish and chips are solid.</review>

This is a great bar, with delicious food and great service. It won’t take more than a few visits to be on a first name basis with the funny and friendly bar tenders. Lots of beers on tap, so be sure to check this place out!</Text>

We stopped in for some beer and snacks before heading out of the city. We were there on Sunday around 1:30 with our kids. There was a back room that we had all to ourselves. Free wifi, excellent beer selection, great food- best Brussels sprouts small plate we've had, good thick fries.< /Review>

Great selection of beer presented beautifully behind in bar. The food was ok, but nothing more. The bartender was polite, but none of our special requests (avocado on my burger, and the sauce on the side for the salad) were honored when we got our plates.</text>

The Crafty Fox is a go-to for me for a beer and some great bar bites. I would only like it more if they featured some red ales over IPAs but I know that I'm part of the minority that doesn't love IPAs.< /Text>

<Review>The Crafty fox is a tidy, cozy and lovely pub owned by a few friendly Irish guys.  This used to be my favorite neighborhood bar back when I lived in the Mission - unfortunately it's a bit of a distance for me now, but I still stop be for old times sake.

The beer selection is one of the BEST in the city. There are around 34+ beers on tap with a focus on the local craft beer scene - special emphasis on Almanac and Fieldwork. Crafty also has flights according to taste, but I would defer to getting a pint of the knowledgable bartenders recommendations as the flights seem a little over priced.

Craft ambiance is clean, whimsical (a little old world) with a long copper bar top, wooden interior and naked Edison lightbump fixtures. I love the casual, low-key vibe, that can make any patron feel comfortable - especially after a couple of their beers. Pedro, the head chef, used to buy fresh flowers from the farmers market every week - which were a beautiful, bright addition to the bar.

The food is SF pricing but solid all around. You can spend a pretty penny on food if you try to do a full dinner. I always default to the kennebec fries (because few snacks go better with a beer than fries) which are reasonably priced at $6 for their size but I typically chose to eat elsewhere for my entree. Food options in the mission are abundant.</Review>< pics>

<text>A large selection of above average beers on tap and an upscale bar menu with kicked up favorites  (K.orean F.ried C.hicken wings) and adventurous bites for foodies (octopus*). Overall the place is a bit pricey$$, but the beer slingers are attentive, knowledgeable and often willing to let you taste a beer. Thus avoiding buyer's remorse. And the food comes out hot and fast!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) Very large choice of beer which is nice (especially for the IPA) and the place is very nice. On the other hand it is a bit expensive.

<Time>1477795857563</Time><Rating>4</Rating><text>(Translated by Google) The selection of beers is undoubtedly excellent but the attention and the bathrooms leave much to be desired. It is very close to the Zeitgeist so I recommend leaving space to play a role in both places. The bathroom .... ufff is worse than that of the bus terminal in Mexico City.

La selección de cervezas es indudablemente excelsa pero la atención y los baños dejan mucho que desear.
