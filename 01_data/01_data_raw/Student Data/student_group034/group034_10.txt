My mom was placed on a 72 hour hold at the hospital emergency room because of insurance they transferred here to delamo not once has the doctor reached out to us to explain what the plan is or even let us know what is happening. My mother sleeps all day and when she showers wears the same dirty clothes again. Left several messages for the doctor to call not once has he been available to speak to. The worst service ever there please do not allow your loved ones to come here to this facility<//Text>

This place needs charged with malpractice. They are horrible. My wife was there for 10 days, I was unable to talk to her doctor once. They released her and by law need to schedule a follow-up appointment with a psychiatrist. So we had an appointment with a follow-up psychiatrist and they didn't show up. No call, no way to get ahold of them. She is having side effects to the medication het Dr gave her at Del Amo. Of course, we are unable to talk to the doctor. I hope this place gets shut down. Never take any friends or family there. Read the reviews...< /text>

I miss my roommates but we will stay in contact but over all this place was very chill and if i ever do need to go back to a hospital i would always prefer Del Amo because this place helped a lot i made so many new friends there and i will always thank everyone there that wanted me to get better because now i really want to enjoy life and this was a challenging experience but over all i learned a lot in Group time and Study hall was the chillest class but i mostly liked Group because we talked so much about self esteem and many other things.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Can't give less then 1-star ... Had to contact local attorneys after my son transferred here from 200 miles! away after an incident in college.  Parents out of state and fly in ... absolutely terrible "health care" experience. I'm a physician for a large hospital system myself and still can't believe how unprofessional their psychiatrists are. Parents (or anyone really) look elsewhere. Still contemplating CA state medical board issues (though I hate this method) as I don't want to see others go through this nightmare.</review><user>105121522615763005075<//user>< Date>

< review>
I'm sorry to say that if I could I would give this hospital no stars. A while back I stayed at this hospital because I was going through things in my life and I needed help that is all. I was struggling and I needed someone to talk things through with but unfortunately this was not the case. When I first arrived at this hospital they ask me for a urine sample and to check my body to count my scars and cuts and to make sure I didn't have anything on me, which is understandable. The lady who viewed me took me into a room and asked me if I was religious and if I was, what religion. i proceeded to tell her I am Christian, I was just going through things and needed extra help to work things out. She told me I was going to hell for putting my family in this position and that I should think really hard about what I had done to them...ARE you kidding me?? first off I was a minor at the time and second how dare you. The staff was extremely disrespectful... I saw the psychiatrist twice. Once when I got there and and right before I was about to leave less than five minutes both times. They drew my blood and when I asked why they didn't give me an answer. the rooms were disgusting... my roommate peed on the floor and no one came to clean it.. it sat on the floor for at least a few hours. The pictures they provide are not accurate.. there are paintings on the windows to so you cannot see outside in any windows.. there is writing on the walls in the rooms...I have my nose pierced and I had it done two years before I came to this hospital and I have never had a problem with it, however coming here I got a bad infection in my nose... Phone time is REALLY limited there were days were I didn't get to talk to my mom. Once my dad came to visit and there was a vending machine there and he gave the staff money to give to me. when he left he called making sure I got the money they told him they gave it to me. when I finally talked to him on the phone he asked me if I got any money I told him I didn't. This hospital did not help and I would not recommend to anyone. the only thing positive that came out of this hospital was sparking my interest and motivation to go into the medical field to make sure no one has to go through what I did.<//review>

Omg. Christina or Kristina, just broke the law. She just violated hippa laws and is a nurse here. She answers phones and is giving medical advice over the phone. She needs to be a patient here. I'm getting my lawyer involved on this place. This place is criminal, they keep patients longer than needed to charge insurance. I can't believe this place is even real. It's like a dark ages medieval torture place for people. They need to be shutdown.<//review>

Hi, I'm Jenna Gephart. I was as this hospital for 4 days and I had the worst experience ever. That staff were rude, and did not care about how you felt. Food was terrible, I got food poisoning. I do not recommend this place unless you are looking forwards to going to prison. This place was terrible. You got no privacy, no support, and no love. The doctors treated you like you were violent prisoners. One time I was there an 8 was being brought in. He was terrified. Instead of telling him everything was going to be okay, They gave him a shot to make him "shut up" as the nurses said. Do not send your kids here, Parents.</Review>

As a parent I feel I it is important to give my experience with Del Amo. My son who is 20 years old, did have a good experience. As the mother of a child that had to make this choice I am glad I did.  I was able to to talk to the nurses and social workers they were quite helpful. There were 3 pay phones that I was able to reach my son at anytime. My son was fortunate to meet friends and that did help and hopefully they will stay in-touch. If your child needs help, get it! It is not about you, but them. Sometimes the distances between parent and child is good, so the child can figure things out on their own. My husband also did speak with the doctor communication is open.  This is never an easy decision, but at the end of the day I am glad that we both (myself and son) felt it was the right one. Thank you, Del Amo.<//text>

I'm a 17 year old boy was here for a total of 6 days for saying stupid, threatening things online, thus leading to the common-sense conclusion that I am mentally ill. If anyone was in with me during my time (10/27-11/1), I was the short skinny Asian dude with the ponytail who didn't talk or hang out with the other boys much. I honestly thought this hospital was decent though, it isn't as bad as other former patients are saying it is. I got to make new friends for life, learn valuable life lessons, and the staff are not bad at all unless you're a complete idiot. Food is definitely better than the food my school, and beds are serviceable. If you're well behaved, take care of yourself, and take medication they give you,  the psychiatrist there should be letting you out sooner than later. Never once when I was in here did I ever have thoughts of escaping or even wanting to go home. This will definitely be an experience in my life I never forget.</Review>

The doctors only asked you like 3 questions. You never saw a psychiatrist. They would have you be in your room for most of the time. When you went outside, there was 1 hoop with so little space. The rooms were practically the same size. There’s were some things like having a social worker come and have writing assignments. My roommates were super fun to be with. I think my roommates helped me more than that facility. Never again.

DONT GO HERE

This placed traumatized me as a 10 year old. Have to pay to call home, very limited visiting hours. Nurses were rude to the children and obviously only wanted to be there for a pay check not to help. No therapists available and the only time I spoke to a professional they evaluated if I could leave. They promised I would leave with in 3 days but kept me a 4th day just to see how I'd react. My only good memory there is the children who were nice to me and one singular nurse who let us go outside for an hour and actually taught us coping skills one day but that was IT. Also they told me to sign papers at the beginning and did not tell me I would be staying there, obviously as a 10 year old I wouldn't have read through all the wordy papers with text I didn't understand. They also tried to draw my blood with out my consent but I declined multiple times and they finally let me off the hook. Food was okay and rooms were just okayish, not much sunlight and I wasn't very comfortable.</text>< Gmap_id>

<text>I was here for approximately 11 days in the adolescent unit. I believe I was in the non-intensive care unit and the staff there was very helpful and very attentive to their job. It really is only a bad experience if you make it a bad experience yourself. If you follow along the rules and you show respect to the doctors and workers there if they will show respect back. Specific shoutout to Bruce, Summer, Stuart, Madi and others who usually work there! (i don’t remember all that well, i’m sorry to those i couldn’t name) you all made it a little easier to be there. ESPECIALLY STUART thank you for being a calm and welcoming presence to the environment i was in.</text>< rating>

I was admitted here one year ago and despite the reviews, it was actually a good place to be. the food was good, (burgers/pancakes/chicken tenders etc) roomates were very welcoming and nice. a few nurses seemed like they didn’t wanna be there but the rest made jokes with us and made the experience memorable. it’s true that the doctors were rarely seen, however you did get to talk to people about how you’re feeling. not sure why everyone had a bad experience, but if i were to get admitted again, i’d want to come back here.</Text>

Summer the program manager is mean and spiteful, she did not handle situations right at all. You barely do any groups and if you do there in you’re room.

My daughter is her still currently I was originally told her discharge date would be tomorrow on Wednesday and when I called her the person that answered told me they moved up her date for today. I said ok I got here at 930am I was told she would be out shortly it wasn't until 30 mins after waiting se person came out and said that her discharge paperwork wasn't started. So you mean to tell me all day yesterday they didn't have time to complete it and decide to start it upon my arrival. To top it of its not like I can go home I live 2 hours away in the high desert area very unprofessional and inconsiderate.<//Text>

<Review>I was admitted into the adolescent unit around September-ish. It was one of the worst experiences I’ve had.  Honestly, this place felt more like a boot camp than a psychiatric hospital. When I arrived, I knew right off the bat that I was in for trouble as it took forever for the people there to check me in. While the other teens in the unit were given things like toothbrushes, hair combs, and pillow cases, I was not given anything besides a single bedsheet and a pillow with no case. The staff are incredibly rude and disrespectful. I remember this one nurse named Karneesha or something like that, giving me a hard time and making my life miserable. Oh and not to mention that they did practically nothing about another patient who threatened to physically attack me. I left the hospital feeling worse instead of better.< /Review>< pics>

<text>I've been here twice, the staff never gets better. They treat us like pests they have no patience which is something you need when working with kids that have mental illnesses and disorders who usually come from messed up backgrounds. They have disordered room preparations too. The food is awful and most of the adolescents who get sent here usually have anger issues and it doesn't help with those of us with anxiety, the staff let's them do whatever they want too when having an episode. The food has made me vomit multiple times. And overall they Love to delay our discharge times, they changed mine like 3 times. If you go in voluntarily, you can't come out that way either saddly. The place is dirty too, the first time I found crusty guy boxers behind my roommates drawer which was the co ed unit too.<//text><rate>1<//rate><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1606192224138< /Date>< GmapID>

It was absolutely terrible. The psychiatrist lied to my parents to keep me there for an extra week for the insurance money. The company this place is run by is notorious for doing this. It was more of a prison than anything else. The outside area was smaller than the average house, and everyone was treated more like cattle than patients. They let a patient wander around into people's rooms and take stuff, and then that same patient punch another in the face. The male nurses dont respect female patients privacy either. They also hid the patients rights books away from everyone. I should have gotten mine the moment I walked in, but I never did. Do not, by any means, send someone here. This is not a place to get better, it's a place for the doctors and nurses to get paid.< /Text>

I'm a 13 year old girl and everytime the doctor would  interviewed me and he wouldn't hear my side of the story, he brushed everything off, but some of the patients are relatable to whatever you're going through.

<review>I went here in either 2017 or 2018. Never again.
Worst hospital I've ever seen. It was dirty, the food was terrible, but the worst part was the lack of my medication. They forgot to give me my medication for days!! I was sent there, promised that they would have all of my medications, but there was one they said they didn't even have there, that lack of gave me severe withdrawals. Then as for my normal anti depressants -- I told one of the nurses that they hadn't given it to me for days and she literally checked my chart and said oops.< /review><username>Kacey<//username><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80dd4b1bffffffff:0x1cd85be30bccd29f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I am a concerned parent... my child is an adult “19” and I am not able to get of hold of anyone!! So frustrating and disappointing that a place of hope that is turned out to be a nightmare and scary for my daughter. We hoped that this place would help her in someway for her well being, but it turned out to be the worst place to have gotten help for my daughter. She was given medications without being seen by a Physician or a Psychiatrist.!! How in the f#%k your going to give someone medications without speaking to them or evaluate them one on one??? I am very concerned with how they take care of patients and how they deal with people's rights! And on top of all the BS, my daughter was almost assaulted by another patient, another woman, that was roomed with my daughter. my daughter had to ask the staff to be moved out to a different room because she feared for her safety, how in the world is this place a safe place when my daughter doesn't even feel safe being there when that is supposed to be a safe place for her to get the help she needs!!!! It seems that these people do not care for the patients just their paychecks!! I have called 2 days in a row and still have not had anyone call me back. How are we supposed to feel that she will get better it the Dr. Valdez doesn't even call us back or give my daughter the proper care she needs!</review>

I was kept here for about 5 days in January . I was fed raw vegetables for most of my stay because I am vegetarian and lactose intolerant, they very rarely provided almond milk. The nurses weren’t very professional, some were nice but other would just talk to each other the whole time. Some even brought food and ate in front of us. The day of my discharge my mom had to wait 4 hours because the nurses misplaced my paperwork and didn’t tell the nurses I was leaving after changing shifts. My skin is really bad due to the harsh “soap” on my eczema. It really didn’t help me.<//Text>

My 11 year old daughter was taken here from our Orange County home.  It was her first time in a hospital and I agree with the reviews.  It was impossible to get any treating physician or psychiatrist, as her Mom, I was never once contacted by the hospital or any treating care provider.  I called daily and after her three day hold the hospital held my daughter without cause.  By the end of her stay, she had learned how to escape the facility and the best ways to get meds from the doctors.  She is still there and when last we spoke, she said the nurses and social workers were encouraging her to go into foster care instead of coming home.  I deeply regret seeking help from them.  She was just defiant and throwing tantrums when she went in, now, she claims she has never loved us and at 11, is ready to live on the street.< /text>

I have to say they did get me on the right medication. However, the food, always cold.  It went down the toilet every meal, except for Boost and juice, lots of juice. They lost my wedding ring and driver's license. Nothing to do except sleep . If you could, they check you and your room every 15 minutes. It was crazy 🙃< /Text>

Went to Del Amo for a voluntary admission for suicide ideation. Was some of the best service I could ever ask for from a psychiatric facility. They were very good at listening to me and my concerns, on time with meds, and seemed very concerned with my safety. I'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking for help. They may keep you longer than you want, but trust me, it's for the best and always for your safety. Thank You to the staff of Del Amo for the great care.< /text>

Definitely the best behavioral health place I've been at. Yes, I wasn't there by choice but it was almost...enjoyable. GREAT staff, good food, just a great place to be if you happen to be on a 5150. 😅< /review>

<review>Our calls was never returned despite the urgency of the mater,, I felt they just want to do the minimum and let the patient go no mater what is his condition, maybe insurance have to do with it ,, Im not sure but I was very disappointed and discouraged, in fact the patient who they insisted that he is fine was readmitted back at midnight  of the same day he was released  to another hospital, an ordeal that could have been avoided if they just do as the oath they took before practicing medical care.   the only Person who l can give thanks for was Carry the social worker.</review><userid>113162978239480672418< /userid>< gmap_id>

My daughter was treated very well here, with music and art therapy as part of the program.  She told me the food is very good and the staff is helpful & pleasant.  A far cry from other community hospitals; thanks to Del Amo staff from a grateful mother.<//text>

One star is too much for this place. It’s the worst psychiatric adult unit ever. They do not care abou the well-being or safety of the patient. The social worker never answers her call and never calls back regardless of several messages I left.
Dr Wong is a terrible physician. He does not care about his patients , all he does is prescribe medication and discharge patient regardless whether this patient is a danger to himself or others. He disregards all phone calls.
If you google his name you will find no information about his training or board certification.
If you have a choice DO NOT take your loved one to this hospital.
A terrible place.< /text>

< Review>
Horrible facility.... I could never get the doctor to call me back, he only called the first day he arrived. Very rude nurses. My husband works until 4:00 pm and visiting hours are only 1:30-2:30 so the doctor approved him to go after work to see our son. He arrived and they refused to let him in because of a shift change. He had to wait over a hour, when they finally did let him in, they made him leave after 10 minutes!! Very wrong to do to a parent who just wants to visit their child!! Also, no therapy was done just basically let the episode pass, up the medication, and send him home!! Would never recommend this place for a child.< /Review>

AWFUL place. Had a loved one here. Physician only spoke with them for 2 minutes and kept cutting them off. The on call (weekend) physicians will write a 5250 ONLY because the admitting physician isn’t there. Then when they are back on Monday, patient can be discharged and they never have to go to the court hearing to reveal that they pronged the hold without probable cause. I absolutely want my loved one safe and would not advocate for them to come home if they were still a danger. I will be pursuing further legal action to report this facility and their illegal 5250’s, that were written WITHOUT assessment.

I called the morning after my loved one was admitted and spoke to a nurse, who didn’t ask my name or relation to them. Gave me info. Only when I started asking about his discharge did she say that she did not have authorization to release medical information. He later signed the paper (that was never offered to him) but, complete violation of HIPAA that she gave me information before cutting me off when she didn’t like my questions.

I spoke with only one nurse who was kind, listened, and advocated for my loved one. The rest were rude, short and snappy. As a nurse myself, it is so sad to see patients treated without respect and dignity.

Wish I could give this place negative stars, they should be shut down.<//Text>

My daughter was in the facility and did not receive the right medical treatment. While she was in there she had a sore throat that was not treated right away which caused her to end up with a ear infection resulting in us pulling her from that place and rushing to a hospital where they care about there patients and giving her the right medical treatment she needed. The staff only gives you the run around telling you oh this person will call you and they never do. I do not recommend this facility to anyone . And also they don't know what they are doing there because when we checked my daughter out they gave us some other patients paperwork and belonging instead of my daughters belongings. So we had to drive all the way back from Orange to Torrance to give them the other patients belongings.</Text>

Having had extensive non helpful treatment for severe trauma I discovered Del Amo"s trauma unit. I was amazed at how different this unit is from average psychiatric units. There knowledge of trauma ability to give you the skills and knowledge to learn to life beyond the traumas effects is remarkable. The staff is kind, respectful, and understanding. The work that is done there can be intense , but it is healing and sacred. I can't say enough positive things about this unit and hospital.I received help that I had never received before. My life is going well now and I am deeply grateful to the staff and program. It is definitely worth the ten hour drive each way to get there and back. I would go back to this unit in a minute if I ever needed to.  The staff is so caring. I can't recommend this unit and its program enough.<//text>

MOST ACCURATE REVIEW
I’ve been to a few mental heath facilities and Del Amo is by far the worst one I’ve been admitted to. I do not wish on anyone to be imprisoned there, literally imprisoned. They think you can hang yourself with a hoodie string that is literally sewn in. This is not a happy environment rather a boot camp. I was sentenced a 3 day hold but it turned into a week stay for no reason. My parents wanted me out and even though i was the most happy and positive person in the hospital, they claimed that i remained in a depressive state. I’m only 17 so my opinion doesn’t matter i guess and My parents didn’t even agree to sending me there, but apparently it’s policy and the hospital was required to send me there.  I arrived happy and left feeling stressed. If anything, this place does not help with depression or handling your struggles, but it makes your mood worse than when you arrived. If your main goal is to stay alive, then this place will promise you that as long as your behind the walls. At nighttime, sometimes you’d here screaming and banging from a unit you weren’t even close to. You’ll be checked on every 15 min 24 hours a day and it would personally wake me up in the middle of the night. They also take your vitals at 5am while you’re still sleeping. I lost a lot of weight there because the food was so terrible that i couldn’t even force myself to eat it. I can’t forget to mention that the showers are usually cold and their “shampoo, conditioner, and body wash” is actually hand soap that leaves you feeling grosser than before you entered the shower. If you wish to speak to your doctor or a social worker, good luck to you since they are never around and if they are, they are fast walking through the halls to avoid the patients. I was bullied by one of the nurses and i honestly think it’s because the place is driving her insane as well. Fortunately, i was mentally stable enough to keep myself together and not scream at the workers or punch walls to try and escape. Fresh air can lift someone’s mood, but your outside time is surrounded by enclosed walls and you only have 20 minutes a day to soak in as much sun as you can.
They believe they know what’s best for you, but honestly i can be a better doctor myself. I had  better advice in the groups then the group leaders. The group room smells like it hasn’t been aired out in years, because it hasn’t. The workers carry around a clip board the whole day writing notes about you which can cause an anxiety attack since you what they are writing is most likely false and will keep you there for more days!!!
Eventually you get used to the environment you’re in, but it doesn’t change the fact that you feel like you’re in prison. The only way you’re getting out of That place is if a lawyer gets involved.
I truly wish that the state would do something to improve our health care system or else this hospital will only get worse.
Please, please don’t think twice about sending someone you know here, think 10 times before you make your decision. Let’s just call this place Hell Amo instead of Del Amo.</Text>

My review is a bit long overdue but I felt the need to still submit a review in hopes to help ease the minds of mothers like myself who happen to come across this experience which I personally could compare to a nightmare.
My 12 year old son was brought to Del Amo after being placed on a 72 hr hold and after seeing all these horrible reviews my mother instinct kicked in. I couldn't bare the newly expressed feeling of my 12 year old who to me seemed normal, let alone be okay with him being transferred to such a "horrible" facility.
It is true we have no say where our kids get transferred to after being placed on a 72 hr hold and I was very upset that I was not told that after being transported in the ambulance and taken into the facility through the back door, the nurse that opened the door didn't notify me that I would not be able to see my son anymore. All she told me was that I couldn't go in through the back and that i had to go through the front lobby. If I would have known I wasn't going to be able to see my son until the following day I would have hugged and kissed him goodbye but ofcourse, I found that out after I had been sent to the lobby. I was able to speak to him through the phone when I called the unit he was in.
Aside from that for a psychiatric facility, which some people in previous reviews seem to forget , they do their job and are helpful as much as they could be.
My son was the oldest for his unit and they were patient enough to answer my every annoying question even when calling as early as 6AM. I always made sure to take down the names of every person I spoke to. When the kids wouldn't pick up the payphone, I would call the nurses station and they'd explain that the kids were in group.
My son didn't really complain, he did say he wanted to go home and that he didn't want to be there but him knowing how overprotective I am over him he didn't complain. He just wanted to come home. Again he was placed on a 72-hr hold so to my understanding he was just gonna be monitored to make sure he wasn't a threat to himself or others. I did expect for him to speak to the psychiatrist for longer than he did but I also understand my son was not his patient and that the Dr was there to evaluate and help make a recommendation as far as treatment.
Upon leaving the place we were set up with a follow up appointment with my son's therapist and given a copy of the documents that pertained to my son.
Unfortunately, being sent to places like these aren't planned but they do their job.
As far as the stars goes for this review, I choose one star cause  I need to give it stars because in my honest opinion you can't really rate a psychiatric hospital with stars... lol
Hope this review helps scared, first time(and last, I hope) mothers like myself keep an open mind.< /text>

<review>As a parent, trying to get any information or access to the social workers is a phone tag type of scenario. My son was admitted on Sunday the 18th, it's Wednesday....with "0" communications!  I get 300% more information on how my son is doing, the treatment i.e. groups, 1×1sessions;  the medications and diagnoses from him during the 3× a day he calls me!
(((Edit, 8/23  I don't know how Sarah is a case manager, how do you arrange Transportation for a child to come home,  without talking to the owners of that home? You took the word of a individual whom has learned from the streets how to lie, steal, assault and rob people. Instead of FACT checking....and making sure "Going Home" was the safest bet?? I've been in institutions since I was 12yr old as a ward of the state....you NEVER believe the paitent without FACT checking first!!! My suggestion....perhaps Sarah isn't ready, nor prepared to handle said caseload!!)))

*lifts a brow*
For my son.....Del Amo is a great & amazing place!! He's recieved the help and refocus he needed....he says that the food is very rich to the palate and good. The staff are extremely helpful and went out of their way to care for him.( for "THAT" ......I am truly and deeply grateful!) The therapists listen to "WHAT" he is saying instead of prejudging him based off of medical bias; which does happen within the medial field.  I wish I had an experience close to that of my son's....I hope I never have to experience this path with him again, but if we do...I'll be taking him to Del Amo!!</review>< Response>

During a 72 hour psych hold on a minor, we attempted on several occasions to communicate with doctors and nurses.  The doctor never called and we got conflicting information on whether she'd seen a doctor and no one could tell us when she'd be discharged.  They'd leave us on hold for 45 minutes or longer, NEVER had the doctor call, and had one return phone call after a dozen calls.  The only time I spoke to someone during my call it took almost an hour of refusing to hang up until I spoke to a supervisor and the only answer I got was a doctor had seen her the day before and his name.  Then when I showed up to get her they wouldn't discharge her and said the doctor had extended her stay but they couldn't tell me why. I had to demand answers and after having me use the lobby phone to speak to the nurse they realized they didn't want me loudly proclaiming their incompetence and apparent insurance gouging in front of the new "customers" and ushered me back.  I told them she wasn't spending another night here and if they intended to keep her they should make me a bed roo because I wasn't leaving without her.  It took another hour but they got the doctor on the phone and confirmed that there was no medical or mental reason for keeping her, and now I am waiting for her to be processed out.  They are taking their sweet time and it will have me sitting in at least 4 hours of traffic tonight thanks to their deliberate slow action (I'm now the ONLY person in the lobby and have been for more than an hour) but she will NEVER come back to this joke of a hospital.< /Review>

<Review>It was just terrible. The workers do not care. You only see your doctor, social worker, anyone that helps you with mental illnesses five minutes or less each day and that's it. You also have zero privacy. I know they need to keep an eye on you. But they also take it too far. Even see you when you're showering. They just don't care. They told us that if we ask when we are leaving, they will turn and walk away from us. And they just lock you in your room where you would be in your own thoughts. That doesn't help. I say. If you have suicidal thoughts or just feeling like everything is going downhill, talk to someone. Call the suicide hotline. Anything! Just not this. This will not help you.< /Review></record>

<Time>1557474565766</Time><text>This place is a joke and should be shut down or have people who work there that can do there job or want to do there job. My daughter was sent here and I wasnt given much info, so I called in to find out whats going on before I show up and the receptionist was short and rude with me. On my way there to see my daughter a nurse called me to say my daughter was checked in and settled and a doctor will be calling me. No doctor called me, so The next day 24 hours later I called in. I am worried about my daughter not knowing what is going on with her at all since no one told me anything. I called and told the nurse on the phone that no doctor had called yet and they tell me today they will and I get no call at all. 48 hours later still no call from a doctor, so I called in again cause i am very worried about my daughter and no one there is telling  me anything. I called telling them no doctors has called me yet and they tell me same thing again they will see her soon and i had to be aggressive and tell them they are lying to me and how worried I am and how i was gonna file a grievance on them. Now 72 hours later still no doctor call, so I call in to find out when my daughter is gonna be released and was told i will find out and put on hold for 46 mins then had to go to work worried as well freaking out. My step mom went over there to pick up my daughter, see Hope Hankin review on how that went. In the end my daughter was there over 72 hours. My daughter told me they gave her benadryl at night, oh and they never told me about it or asked, so beware. My daughter will never ever be going back here again. I wish no kid has to go here ever.</text>< resp>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>I went here a couple years ago for suicidal thoughts as well as depression and anxiety. For all of my stay, it felt like a prison. As a patient, I was given close to no information about my stay. It seemed as though they didn't spend any time trying to help the patients in the ward. They mostly shut us up in a room, watching cartoons, unable to talk to our peers. The people who came in trying to teach us coping mechanisms were there for less than ten minutes. The doctor who saw me spoke to me for barely a minute each day. When I was admitted, I told one of my triggers for panic attacks was yelling. They took absolutely no care with that. There was one nurse who screamed at us patients when we so much as talked. At some point, that same nurse was chasing a kid around the room, yelling at them. The nurses always threatened misbehaving kids with shots, which scared them. I would not recommend going here, as I've heard that there are many better places. I hope that kids don't have to go through the same experience as me.<//Text>< UserId.>

If I could give 0  I would, this place is the worst no way to get a hold of doctors or social workers, it's supposed to be a place to relax for depress people but actually for what goes on inside they get worse, they are bullied, yelled at, if your kid is depressed believe me it will come out worse, they give them sleeping pills because of all the scandal that goes inside at night with the other youngsters. Don't know who runs this place but it's a matter of time until they get sued.< /Text>

At first I wasn’t open to being there.  I was in NTC.  After three days of isolating myself, I finally tried to participate.  The staff is amazing even though a night medication nurse was rude and ghetto.  That was my only problem & too large portion sizes at meals.  The social workers, therapist, nurses, & Dr. Hirsch all care. I miss them all❤️.< /text>

<pics>None<//pics><review>I was put here for syciatric care. The staff was very rude, screaming and yelling at the kids. I had a meal of a Veggie burger, then got food poisoning! They serve food that is dangerous! They don’t allow kids to socialize that much. You are constantly monitored by security cameras (Even when you’re in your room, changing, or naked!) they served warm tap water for drinks. Kids would constantly fight and they’d call security to give them a syringe of a tranquilizer like substance called “Booty Juice”. When giving this injections they’d forcefully hold/strap you down in painful ways. The worst hospital ever. The showers were broken, you’d constantly be given drugs and get poked with needles, ghetto neighborhood, terrible staff, dangerous conditions.

Facilities were great, food was amazing way better than school lunches, nurses were caring and attentive, psychiatrist wasn't the best.
The nurse, Patrick was a really cool dude that helped me out during my worst. If you need someone to talk to ask for him, he's down to listen.
An advice a paramedic gave me the day I arrived was to always keep my head up and I learned why. If you seem in bad shape, they'll make you stay longer but if you smile and interact with the other kids you'll be allowed to go home early which might have not been the best choice for me.
Be honest with your psychiatrist so they can truly help you and get help when needed.< /review>

You never see your doctors ever because they’re too lazy to show up and you get stuck with this sub doctor who doesn’t care for you. You only talk to them for a max of 30 secs. Social workers are rare there and everyone expects you to find them even though YOU LITERALLY DON’T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. Coming out made me worse no lie.

<Text>Food? They was supposed to shut this place down already. The treatment of patients by staff is closer to the zoo than a hospital. Racist, special privileges given to certain patients discriminately. Structured like a prison that only benefits the cities homeless population. Forced sleeping arrangements, forced medication, forced stay. They get physical. Even went as far as to say that each group therapy session you attend as a patient while in the hospital counts towards your release date. This was a kidnapping. Can't believe they're still in business. Well you must either be Mexican homeless or one of the staff members boys or female sexual interest at the time.</Text><time>1539842477972< /time><rating>1</rating><GmapID>0x80dd4b1bffffffff:0x1cd85be30bccd29f< /GmapID>< pics>

<review>Was hospitalized here a couple years back honestly was a waste of time and money. I'm still paying off my hospital bill.  A male worker walked in on me while I was showering, a bulimic openly made herself throw up after meals and was not stopped , another girl was covered in cuts from a razor and continued to self harm while there. Patient care is not a priority here as long as no one  kills themselves in here they call it a day and  pride themselves in having done a good job. Look for a good therapist instead and avoid this place.</review>< rating>

Absolutely horrendous place. The people are so mean, and hang up on you all the time. I simply ask a question. One of the worst nurses I have ever spoken to in my life is Virginia. She was very rude and mean and would cut me off when I just call and speak a sentence asking about my brother. She insulted me several times. The workers there are evil. They seem like they should be In their own mental institution, very deranged. They seem like smokers and drug abusers and I'm not talking about cigarettes.... please do not take anyone who you care about to this institution. They discharged my brother and he was still in a gown, wasn't even well yet. Luckily he was able to be taken to kaiser. Please avoid Del Amo. I'm not sure why this institution is still alive.<//Review>

<review>I was 12 when I was put their in that hospital they made you eat half the food or you would not be left out of the room they strapped a 5 year old down and they injected  a 10 year old girl with "booty juice" an injection  without her or her parents consent they would lock the doors. The doors were heavy metal with a little bullet proof  window when my mom was late she wanted to spend time with me and the lady who worked their yelled at my sobbing mother. We were rarely let outside and when we were there was maybe a 15 by 15 space to play . I still cry and remember the screaming and how they woke up up every 3 hours and how they forced you to take pills I will never forget the devastating effect Del Amo mental hospital had on me.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< GmapID>

I had to have someone placed on a hold due to unfortunate experiences. Worst case scenario, they were placed at this disgusting facility.  After them being placed at this facility the doctors, nurses, and all staff had no desire to talk to family members, the patient, or anything. The entire time was cloaked in secrecy with zero transparency as to what the treatment plan or the general idea was. Nurses were incredibly rude and were threatening to keep them there up to 14 days just “because legally [they] can” when i was just trying to figure out what was going on. This facility will make me never consider placing a loved one on a 5150 ever again.< /text>

Do everything you can to not send your child here!  They do not communicate well with parents and you do not have any information from them, even when you call, you have to leave three messages before you can talk to the psychiatrist.  AVOID DR WONG.  He yelled at me on the phone and told me he didn't have all day to talk to me about my child, that he had other patients to see.  He hung up on me when I was asking a question.  He saw my son a total of ten minutes in five days.  He is rude and has zero communication skills.  Staff went behind my back to get to a form signed by my son's father who lives out of state because I would not sign a form to voluntary admit my son this Del Amo.  I would give it zero stars.  Not a good place.  My son has more trauma now than ever.<//text>

A staff member made a patient cry, calling her crazy, she vomited. The males can not speak to the females  and vise/versa if you do they will tranquilize you, the males and females aren't even allowed to watch TV in the same room. There is a staff cafeteria which better taken care of than the one the patients eat I'm, only kids who listen to absolutely everything they say are allowed to eat there one slip up and you're done.

This place is awful, the staff force patients to take pills without the parents consent and the staff pick favorites. The women doing blood tests missed the Vein 3 consecutive times with almost all the patients. No one under 18 is allowed the visit, the slightest hint of disobedience and you are kept there for half as long.< /Text>

About two hours into my stay, a girl began having a heart attack (young girl). I started pounding and pounding on the windows to get the attention of medical staff, and they told me to shut up. Sure enough, the girl fell straight backward and code blue'd. They had to use the defibrillator. They wound up saying she "did it for attention", and proceeded to drug her into oblivion and move her to the intensive unit. We could see her through the windows and she looked like she'd been lobotomized. During my stay, I was detoxing from alcohol, hypnotics and benzodiazepines-the most lethal combination to detox from. I was denied medication for at least 24 hours. I began getting nervous and asked for the Ombudsman (abuse coordinator) number. I was again ignored for hours. When the doctor finally bothered to look up at me, he threatened to sedate me so that I wouldn't cause any trouble. Keep in mind that I was not being hostile or even disruptive at all. After that, I decided I needed to call 911. I went to dial the phone-and THE PHONE HAD BEEN RIGGED SO THAT WE COULD NOT CALL THE POLICE! This is EXTREMELY illegal!! I began to panic and fear that I would never get out. I wasn't crazy, just depressed-but if I acted in any fashion the staff didn't approve of, they would MAKE me crazy just like the girl that had a heart attack. The final kicker is that they denied me my service dog because I didn't have "ID and Certification". If you know anything about the ADA, there is no such think as "proof" of a service dog. The director put me down, saying I didn't even know the requirements so have a SD. What? Basically, I will be filing a lawsuit. I've reached out to the police department as well as the medical complaint board of California. I just pray that not a single more person becomes a victim of this place. I'm glad I work in mental health so I can at least do my part in keeping the mentally ill safe. Curse you, Del Amo. May you burn to the ground along with your staff.<//text>< gmapID>

NEVER GO HERE!! I was put in the teen ward here back in february and it was the worst week of my life, my room was disgusting  the bathroom had blood stains. The food was terrible one of my roomates was given meat that was spoiled and slightly green they gave me a boost milk with throw up on the outside of it. I get  bad panic attacks that make me hyperventilate and the staff did nothing about it when those happened instead they wrote me up and told me to be quiet.  The first 3 days I was there the boys and girls where allowed to talk to each other and then on the 4th day the rules changed and boys and girls couldnt talk to each other or even be in the same room.I  only got to talk to the doctor once and she only asked me one question I never even got diagnosed either I got but on the worst medication and on my first night they gave me benadryl which made me sick but they didn't believe me. If it wasn't for another patient that helped through my panic attacks and my roomates I think I would have gotten worse. They told my mom nothing and she didn't even know where I was going at first whenever she called nobody answered.  That doesn't even scratch the surface of what me and the other patients went through but I want to keep this short and simple. please seek out a different hospital this one will make you and your loved ones worse.<//Review>

I have been here one time I'm 12 and they weren't helpful at all. They are very unsanitary, like there was poop on the bathroom stall wall. They don't talk to you and leave you in your room which didn't help because I have depression. They strapped down a 5 year old and gave him a shot in the leg so he couldn't walk. When they did the body search it made me feel uncomfortable because they were looking. Great I have to go back ;(<//Text>

DO NOT SEND YOUR KIDS HERE!!!
I was here for two months and I felt as if I was in hell. There was another patient there who had extreme PTSD and other psychiatric disorders and would pound walls and doors when they would have an episode. Their hand was so swollen and bruised that it must have been broken in multiple places. The nurses there would completely ignore them and say "We just want them gone." When I was being admitted, some nurses were threatening other patients that they would spray them with a hose if they didn't behave. The rooms were exetremely small and had four to five beds in each. The windows were covered in almost two layers of window coverings from the outside and practically blocked out most light. You got a super thin sheet and a twoo inch thick matress to sleep on.  The pictures on their website IS A LIE! There are no shelves to put your clothes on and most of your stuff was stolen.The food there was most of the time raw and under-cooked and there was nothing healthy in them. If you didnt eat every bite, you would be put in solitary for hours. The "psychiatrist" I had was Dr. Fidel, and he never asked you how you were doing and only added on more time by looking at you. You had to take two minute showers with no shapoo or conditioner, and if you were in any longer, the nurses would come in and drag you out. There were no hairbrushes or combs, and occasionally you would get a fresh tooth brush and tooth paste. No deoderant. No hand soap. No female hygene products. At night the doors to the bathrooms would be locked and you would have to hold your pee till about 10 am the next day. Even though the website says there is art therapy, education, and other forms of therapy, there isn't. You get to go outside for ten minutes and then forced back inside. If you looked at a guy patient, you would be taken to solitary and there would be an extra day added to your "recovery".< /review>

<Review>The NTC department is wonderful, relaxing, not at all intimidating.  All of the staff are engaging, kind and professional.  There was a homey feel, quite comforting.  It was easy to get to know and interract with the other residents.  To be honest, I actually treasure my time there.  There are other divisions at Del Amo which I know little of, but NTC was a pleasure to visit.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

please never go to this hell hole. I was taken voluntarily because my mom was desperate to get me more help. I was there for around 2 or 3 days. I vomited everyday I was there and no one cared. The nurses would make fun of other kids and they would be extremely rude. I was scared to get my blood taken out and the lady was making fun of me for crying and said hurry up despite me being scared. They always threatened to turn off the phone. It was beyond cold and one time there was a group activity and I was freezing and they said I was being anti social. But was cold as hell. The food tasted like dirt. When I was there, they let A DELUSIONAL WOMAN INSIDE THE CHILDRENS UNIT. Here it's listed as 24 hours, but they always left us alone. They threatened to give a young girl, no older 7, a shot for running around. There was a girl who's company I enjoyed, her name was Seattle and the nurses said things like "Haha who even names their kids Seattle?" And "what a dumb name". There was another girl who had the same name or near exact name as me and I think they gave her my meds instead. They lied constantly to me, my mom and everyone. The doctor was a complete scam. It was doctor G or some name like that. He asked all the questions too fast and acted as if he thoroughly evaluated me. I always called my mom and  she forced them to take me out. I've had nightmares and have had extremely bad memories of it. Overall DONT EVER COME HERE, JUST GET A THERAPIST AND IM SURE IT'LL BE OKAY. AND IF YOU DO HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE, GO TO BHA in Alhambra< /Text>

I was just released today from a 5-day stay on the psychiatric ward. I do not recommend this facility as a first choice. There is no connection between the staff and the patients, and all patients are given the same treatment regardless of the reason behind their stay. The staff are very vague when asked by both patients and guardians about the patient's release date, and they are not well-trained to handle patients with anxiety and other mental illnesses. There are obscenities graffitied on the walls in pencil, and nobody has taken the time to wash them off. There have been countless examples of conflict between patients during my stay, and I was victim to sexual harassment by a former roommate. Please reconsider, and go over your options a second time before you choose Del Amo Behavioral Health System to take your child, or anyone else's for that matter, under their wing.</Review>

I unfortunately had to take my son there, horrible experience they really don't care about their patients, almost everyone there is rude and obnoxious, they look at you like you are a pos meanwhile charging my insurance company thousands of dollars per day, if you have a relative that needs help with addiction or depression don't take them there, this place is horrible. The Dr only sees patients like 10 minutes if they are lucky, how are they suppose to diagnos a patient and prescribe medication if you only see them for a brief period of time< /Text>

DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS HERE,
This place is about nothing other then money, most of the staff are cold and have no empathy for the kids or the parents that are going through a tough time. I am sure the Dr and the nurses started in this field to help people but they have completely lost there direction.
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOUR SELF. it is scary when you see this first hand and your child then tells you how mean the staff was and how the doctor was more concerned about his cell phone then talking to our child during a visit with him. Our child had to stay 2 extra days even though we said we wanted her discharged.  ( she was not on a hold) we are so disappointed and so sad for our daughter that was already having a hard time. If they would at least provided some therapy and copping skills that would be one thing but they don't. They don't even have the basic communication skills to make the parents feel that there child will be safe while in their care.
If you guys need some basic training let me know, I will be happy to provide it free of charge. 😡< /text>

<Text>When I was involuntarily admitted here I was having a pretty bad experience already. However, many of the staff members made the experience even worse by being very rude to me, yelling at me and others when we weren't doing anything against the rules. Two staff members even made remarks on how long I'd be staying and acted inappropriately when we had to follow through with standard procedures. When I first arrived I had to go through a body search with one of the "nurses", and while I was taking my clothes off she made faces of disgust and annoyance. I even remember a time where this girl broke down and the staff got annoyed with her and one asked why she was crying in a very rude tone, and in general being very unprofesional. And this was all in the CHILDREN'S WARD! In conclusion, this place is awful.</Text></record>

< Review>
STAY AWAY - unfortunately we had a loved one end up here.  Our loved one had a eval at UCLA ER.  The doctor at UCLA said they wanted to keep our loved one safe.  They wanted to keep him there but were out of beds.  Our loved one was screened and admitted to the trauma unite (NTC) at Del Amo.

An ambulance transported him there at 3:00 am.  He was very upset  but felt a hospital stay would help.  Upon arrival at Del Amo it appears they lost his paperwork so he was in the Del Sol unit.

I received a panicked phone a couple hours later.  Over the phone it sounded like total chaos!  Screaming, crying, everything.  Our loved one was traumatized!

I asked Del Amo "what the hell is going on" and they said "who are we looking for?" ... yes THEY LOST A PATIENT!!!!!!

After about 45 minutes they located his paperwork and said he needed to be evaluated.  I had a copy of his paperwork that said he was ALREADY EVALUATED!  Del Amo said the doctor on call needed to do an eval.  Again I HAD THE PAPERWORK THAT SAID IT WAS ALREADY DONE!

This went on for 6 hours!  Finally Dr. Johnson (btw - I can find NO official medical certifications for this doctor!) evaluated and moved our loved one!  When I talked to our loved one he was majorly traumatized.

At this time a representative of the NTC unit came to talk to me.  I missed her name ... too bad.  Basically she told me to shut up or she would put our child (well 20+ ... still my child!) back in "the general population" ... is this a prison ... YES!!!!!!!!

I decided to stay quiet for the safety of our child.

Now his paperwork said he could return home if the doctor felt he was not a danger to himself.  This "DR" Johnson said "he is not a danger to himself" ... so send him home!   The hospital forced him to stay for 2 more days.

My opinion is this is just a money making operation.  The doctors do not spend much time helping.  The Social Workers do spend a lot of time helping though!

Overall this place does NOT have any care for the customers, both inside and outside the prison walls.

If you have a choice go somewhere else.<//Review>

<text>This place has many highly homophobic/transphobic/etc. staff.-[not all, of course, but a few were.  Referring to the male nurse that called me "Shim", among other things.  I'm intersex, not trans, btw.]  Also, cigarette breaks are the only thing that had made this place bearable, and now smoking isn't allowed there.-I smoke for spiritual reasons-[I'm 1/4th Cherokee and was taught how to truly smoke etc., but whatever.]...  I truly understand claustrophobia a lot better now, too; two hallways is not enough space ["clear the hallway!" is heard over and over, with nowhere else to go, especially once you become lucid yet you cannot get away from those who are still hallucinating and whatnot.]  I've been in many Hospitals now, due to Chronic Insomnia Disorder w/Psychosis; Cedars-Sinai Psych. Unit is still my favorite of them all, but it closed, unfortunately.  When looking back, if I could choose, I would always opt for Aurora Charter Oak Hospital now, [but, again, only because Cedars-Sinai is now closed, sadly], even though it's a tiny unit, too.-but at least there is grass and such during the outdoor breaks.
I should make it clear that I did/do like many of the Staff here; it's all of the other issues that made me dislike it.-("Clear the hallway!"-in other words, go to the room you're placed in or hang-out in the tiny t.v.-room, which is scary, especially if you're hallucinating, as I experience with the sleep-based Psychosis.)

In short, however, I feel that ALL of the Los Angeles Psych. Units need *a lot more funding* to truly make them into a place of *healing*, instead of what they are now:  a place for holding, and/or a place for discarding misunderstood/feared/etc. family/"friends."</text>< Pics>

This is NOT the place for your child or loved one to go! If you or your child needs to be admitted somewhere, try UCLA, or BHC. Both are a million times better. IF you're looking for residential treatment (which I highly recommend) Evolve is an incredible place to look into. Lastly, if you are looking for PHP, or IOP, Engage is another beautiful program where the staff genuinely cares about you. I just graduated a week or two ago, and I can't thank them enough. I wish you the best of luck! Don't be fooled by the pretty pictures they've falsely advertised with.

If you're still not convinced this is a little of what happened while I was there:

I was admitted here September 19th 2016. I was having serious suicidal ideation and I needed to go someplace where I would be safe. When I was admitted I had had no history of past hospital stays and I was already scared of my thoughts and terrified to stay away from my family. When I got there, they sat me and my father down in a nice and clean room to take down our info and admit me. Then they took me through a big metal door and had me say goodbye to my father. Once we were through that door there was a HUGE contrast. It was dirty, and dimly lit. it was something out of a horror movie. They took my vitals, my things, and then gave me a plastic pillow thing, a thin yellow blanket and a sheet, and sent me to a room with three other girls (already asleep).

The conditions were just as bad all through the rest of the days I was there. (The food was hospital food so you know it isn't really the best, but that wasn't an issue really.) The staff was cruel. They treated everyone like criminals. They would make everyone come into a sort of "cafeteria" area, and sit and shut up while some unqualified old man handed out worksheets we had to complete. Then they would lock us in our rooms for two or three hours. (This was a cycle that just repeated itself over and over again until it was time for bed.)

"Booty-Juice" is a term I learned here. It means that if you get too rambunctious, they will hold you down, take your pants off, and stick a shot in your ass to knock you out. It was done quite often.

The girls I stayed with were my saving grace. They were the only kind people there. Although there were many psychotic breakdowns with screaming threats of murder and not being able to control the violent voices in one's head (which is something that they can't help themselves).

At the end of the week, I was a different person. A little piece of me died there, and I can never get it back.
AGAIN: If you or your child needs to be admitted somewhere, try UCLA, or BHC. Both are a million times better. IF you're looking for residential treatment (which I highly recommend) Evolve is an incredible place to look into. Lastly, if you are looking for PHP, or IOP, Engage is another beautiful program where the staff genuinely cares about you. I just graduated a week or two ago, and I can't thank them enough. I wish you the best of luck! Don't be fooled by the pretty pictures they've falsely advertised with.</Review>

My experience in del amo hospital was horrible. They constantly lie to us, keep us medicated 24/7, our phsyciatrists dont care about us at all they lie to us about when we're going to leave.. The food was good but the peoole werent. Ive met maybe 2 people out of all the staff that were actually really nice..The rest ignore your needs.. Very sad place to put a loved one. I remember being so medicated that the next day i wouldnt remember what i even ate the day before..<//review>

<Text>This place is violating serious constitutional and human rights. Children are offered benadryl to go to sleep without the consent of parents, parents are  always advised to medicate their children with Zoloft or prozac WITHOUT a formal evaluation or even having an actual discussion with a doctor--if parents refuse their children are then pressured to tell their parents to accept the terms.The place is threatening to make her stay longer because she refused to take any benadryl and we refused to allow the doctors to give her anti-depressants without a full and proper diagnosis. The doctors don't answer their phones and no doctor would meet with us to discuss our family member's treatment. In the children are constantly threatened and placed in solitary confinement and are given drug injections to tranquilize them if they are in any way unreasonable. Its just AWFUL. I have a family member who was put here and she came out worst.</Text>< GmapID>

This place is straight out of a HORROR film. I went in with anxiety and depression with mild suicidal ideation. I ended up with PTSD after this place. They lied in my paperwork and said I attempted suicide. From the moment I stepped in there, they said I would be there 5-6 days before they even did an evaluation (can I even call it an evaluation? It was 3 Q's).

With the help of my parents, and absolute PERSISTENCE, calling them out on broken laws, I managed to get out in 3 days. Others were not so lucky.

If you know someone in there, the most important thing they can do is put on an act. Act like you are happy, attend all the groups, go to all meals, tell the psychiatrist you are doing great and are looking forward to getting back into the routine of things at home, and have a smile on at all times. You cannot trust anyone. If you tell any staff member that you are anxious, depressed etc you will likely get on a 14 day hold. They will do everything they can to get your insurance money. Call them nonstop even when they stall or don't help. Be pushy but don't yell. Same for the patient, do everything you can to act nice to the staff even when some are verbally abusive. If you make them mad they will increase your hold.

They threw everyone together in the acute psychiatric ward: men and women of all ages, people detoxing from heroin/meth/alcohol, schizophrenia, depression, hallucinations, violence toward others. People threatened to kill me, had bloodied faces and received no medical attention, and one man broke out screaming and threatening everyone and the staff didn't have anywhere safe for us to go.

It's 4 months after and I was recently diagnosed with PTSD. I still have nightmares, flashbacks, and am really shaky most of the time.

If you know someone in there right now, know that I say a prayer every night for the people who are currently in there</Review>

Some of the staff are very rude. When you are having an anxiety attack they keep you longer and don’t help. The rooms are extremely dirty especially the walls. The food is really disgusting and causes patients there to have digestive problems.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I can tell you that I am pleasantly grateful and surprised with the service and with the help that you gave me, I will never have how to pay you so much help, the human quality, the reality that this place shows with respect to the people who entered there, how grateful I left with The life that has put me right in that place and with those people, Cristina, Matthew and all those who I do not remember the name but I will always carry them in my heart ♥ ️ God bless you so much! Thanks a thousand thanks!

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>(Translated by Google) They took my son to lock up there for 72 hours. I took him to the Kaiser to the emergency room, due to a noise in his ear and they suggested that I transfer him to another place because "according" they were going to treat him better, but it was the opposite, (in fact he did not have to have gone to that place) because it is a psychiatric hospital, and not only did they not help him because of what he had gone to treat himself, there he became depressed because he had to spend 72 hours and there was no way to get him out of there, in that hospital ,, There are personnel who show little patience, they are indifferent to patients and I feel that they do not know how to handle some situations that arise according to their training that they are supposed to have, how to provide affection and understanding especially to those who need it the most ,
I wonder what maybe it is normal in such places, in a word I am very disappointed and I advise people not to accept that they take their loved ones as patients to these types of places especially if they do not need it.

(Original)
A mi hijo lo llevaron a encerrar ahi por 72 horas. Yo lo llevé al Kaiser a emergencias, por un ruido que tiene en su oído y me sugirieron que lo transfiriera a otro lugar por que "segun" lo iban a tratar mejor, pero fue todo lo contrario, (de hecho el no tenía porque haber ido a ese lugar) porque es un hospital de psiquiatría, y no solo no lo ayudaron por lo que el había ido a atenderse,, ahi se deprimió porque tuvo que pasar 72 horas y no hubo manera de poder sacarlo de ahí, en ese hospital,, hay personal que se muestran con poca paciencia, son indiferentes con los pacientes y siento que no saben manejar algunas situaciones que se presentan de acuerdo a su entrenamiento que se supone deben tener, cómo brindar afecto y comprensión sobretodo a los que más lo nesecitan,
me pregunto que quizás es normal en ese tipo de lugares, en una palabra estoy muy decepcionada y les aconsejo a los personas que no acepten que lleven a sus seres queridos como pacientes a este tipo de lugares sobre todo si no lo necesitan.<//Text>< userid>

In this place is the reason that my son became obese because of the medicine, unfortunately he fell back to this filthy place and I change the medicine I imagine it is my expensive and for them it is business. I give them a star because there is no option to give them minus 5 and not A star OF THE MASTER, this has frustrated me I do not know what to do they do not let my son out I call and the phone has ringing for more than 10 minutes maybe there are 100.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It is a nightmare to enter there. Patients go worse that can not be called a psychiatric hospital, much less mental recovery. The internal treatment is poor and the sencibility is tremendously ignored and Dr. Gessesse is one of the most insensitive Drs and little interested in getting involved with the patient just medicate and ready there is no medical interaction and the patient's parents nothing is nothing just a prison horrible. Never enter Del amo ....

(Original)
Es una pesadilla entrar ahi. Los pacientes salen peor a eso no se le puede llamar hospital Psiquiatrico ni mucho menos de recuperacion mental. El trato interno es pobre y la sencibilidad es tremendamente ignorada y el Dr. Gessesse es uno de los Drs mas insensibles y poco interesados en involucrarse con el paciente solo medicar y listo no hay interaccion medico y padres del paciente nada de nada solo es una prisión horrible.

<review>Really cool Barber Shop. Two guys...who are friends formed this "partnershop"...and they turn-them-out in style! Professionally perfect cuts. Nice, inviting atmosphere. Free parking...easy to locate.
Fascinating pictures...especially an early Frank Sinatra "mug shot" on the walls.
One of those "ole-time" hang-outs for the boys. Catch-up on "what's going on."

Overpriced. The one on the right charges $17 and the left charges $20. Yet the $17 guy is more skilled. Use to go there twice a month. Barbers half asleep and sometimes they walk out for a talk with someone in the middle of your cut. I guess they G like that but I dont like it. 1 star.  Guy on the right is cool though.</text>

Guys look like they know how to cut hair well. However, when it comes to running an adequate business they need to take a class. Doors supposed to open at 9 on Monday's and Sunday's but it's still closed at 11am. The public uunderstands if it's an emergency or you're sick. If you can't make it just put a sign on the door. Come on fellas get it together.<//Review>

I went for my first time. I told the guy what i wanted and he said it would look stupid and cut my hair how he thought it should be. Never going back. These guys only know how to do fades i guess.</text>

<Text>Good for a little caesars. Usually not too much that's hot n' ready when I go in, but they're quick at making what you want so that means fresh hot pizza. You go to little caesars for the price, but sometimes I just crave the deep dish. I would definitely consider this to be one of the cleaner, friendlier little caesars I've been to, which is great because it's local to me. I can't give it 5 stars because the pizza quality -while good for a little caesers- is not as good as other pizzarias. That being said, if you're in the mood for little caesers, this is a good one to go to!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>They have raised there prices almost 30% taking advantage of the spike in demand for their services during a pandemic. They have not slowed down at all due to pandemic its quite the opposite when most of us are struggling financially. How has the public reacted to when someone buys up all the toilet paper and turns around and resales it to the public at a much higher price?</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This location always has fast service. One or two chairs to sit and wait for order, otherwise standing inside or outside - no problem! We always get the basic 5-dollar cheese or pepperoni Litte C's, always satisfied.</Review>

If you ask for green peppers on only half the Ultimate Supreme, the price goes up by $3.50. That's right, leaving something off the pizza raises the price by 30 percent! (This is not the case at other Little Caesars in the area.) Counter staff says "that's the price for a custom pizza." I won't be coming back.</review>

Low cost Pizza and wings. This location has NO seating. To go or delivery orders only. Recommend the Ultimate Supreme Pizza, Hula Hawaiian Pizza, the Caesar Wings, and the Crazy Bread w/ sauce. Located in a strip mall between a donut shop and a barber, and right off of El Toro Rd.<//review>

< Review>
Little caesars is a staple for us! This one is pretty good. The staff is friendly, and they’re always timely. We don’t ever get the $5 hot and ready’s though. The pepperoni deep dish is where it’s at! A little bit inconsistent with how it comes out though-but still good. Usually needs a little more sauce, but hey, $7 bucks - can’t complain!<//Review>

<UserId.>108091288397878344239</UserId.><Time>1546418504930< /Time><Text>This place is an honest definition of garbage. The poor employees that work there, I feel bad for some of them because they're given instructions and expected to take orders like robots. In other words, they don't truly care about maximizing profits and minimizing losses. From a business perspective, if somebody is literally 2 minutes late to their order, you should have just shut them down saying there's nothing you can do because we all know that there's something you can do the pizza supposed to go to trash or normally these employees take it home happily so at worst just offer it to me for free if there's "nothing you can do" and I'm a returning customer that you value.. I'd rather not hear "there's nothing we can do"</Text>< Pics>

Ridiculousl...this place is a joke. The only reason they are in business is because of their prices. I was waiting to place an order and I just kept hearing the phone ring none stop.Not one person made an effort to acknowledge it.( No wonder I always have to call multiple times before someone answers). The kids that work their are just so rude.I placed an order ahead of time for some wings. And when I got there I still had to wait because according to them " they forgot to defrost the wings". On another occasion I went in with my kids to pick up a hot n ready pizza and once it arrived I asked the guy " Is that mine?"  Be said " whats the magic word". Are you kidding?!?!?!</review>

It's Little Caesars...it can seem pike a good idea when you are starving and even halfway through eating the pizza (if you are eating fast enough)...but i always regret it afterwards. Too greasy.< /Review>

I will say this if u are hungry and want good pizza go here its the best but sometimes u have to wait a little but dont worry u still get the best pizza and its worth the wait they have a good choice for pizza and good choice of drinks plus they are really nice and the pizza 5 out of 5 they also have bread sticks there are only 2 tables with i think 3 or 4 chairs but dont worry if all the seats are full u wont stand for a long time take my word and just try the pizza its better then pizza hut one last thing its cheap not that much.< /Text>

Great pizza at an even better price. This location is sort of dumpy and always has shifty characters as patrons but, if you order for pickup at home and are just going in for a quick grab n go home, its not a big deal.</Review>

Really?!? Why dos the store close so early? at 11PM ON A FRIDAY? makes no senses, thats the day you make the big money.. i was going to buy 10 boxes of pizza and 4 boxes of wings but they closed before they could make money.. looks like this location is going under. bummed out because i love the pizza there. but sadly someone made a bad choice on the hours so now i have to buy Dominos.. ;(< /review>

Ordered pizza a day in advance that I needed to pick up at a certain time. When I arrived they told me it would be a 15 minute wait... what is the point of having an online ordering system if they still have to make your pizza when you get there<//Text>

Little caesars hot and ready $5 pizzas are hard to beat this location is small and usually has a wait. So while you go in here hoping to be in and out relatively quickly... it hardly goes like that.</Text>

<review>I had my first COVID shot at the pharmacy today. The entire process from the front door to leaving was about 30 minutes. From checking-in through actually getting the vaccine, and the 15 minute wait after the shot, was smooth. I can’t thank the pharmacy enough for the efficiency, professionalism and obvious care each employee demonstrated. I drove to Capitola from Monterey to receive the vaccine. It was a great decision! Thank you Capitola CVS!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I moved my prescriptions over to CVS at the request of my health insurer -- but that's about to change -- immediately.  The Pharmacy staff is very unprofessional and disorganized -- it's completely chaotic. Granted CVS is trying very hard to get my business with non-stop coupons via email but this particular CVS is horrible once you step inside.  Products with one price that's $5 more at the cashiers.  Floor supervisors -- particularly Barb (don't call her 'the older person' -- she'll flip on you) who don't solve problems but escalate them.  Steer clear of this CVS.  Not worth the stress.</Text>< Rate>

If I could I'd give half a star, and that's only because of the few caring and on the ball employees that work there, I would. Every month, and I mean EVERY month my son's prescriptions get messed up. They claim things have been filled when they haven't and get angry when they are called on it. With a disability, I chose this pharmacy because of the drive through, but sitting in a line for 30 minutes only to be told that the scripts we were called about aren't ready with no explanation or apology isn't worth it. I plan to find out how to file a complaint with the state Pharmaceutical Board.< /Review>

<Text>Worst pharmacy in the area.  Every time I have had a prescription called into or faxed into this pharmacy, they have lost it.  The doctor has had to call in/resend 2, 3 or 4 times before I can get it filled.  Customer service is not great either.  I do not recommend this pharmacy.  There are better pharmacies in the area.<//Text>< Name>

Pharmacy is horrible!!!! No problem filling a prescription however customer service sucks! I have been here 7 times and every time it is the same issue. I was told 20 minutes wait for my script to fill. Waited 40 minutes and was told they had already called my name, yet the whole time i was sitting right next to the pharmacy. No care for people, let alone I am sick need medicine and just trying to go home.</Text>

I really love the people that work at this pharmacy. The issue is that they do not give the staff enough workers to deal with the amount of people calling and coming in. So if you call you will be on hold for a looooonnng time and if you come in you will be seated for a loooonnnnggg time. This is a very busy and public pharmacy and I really hope that CVS allows more staff to work to help with the overflow. I am currently on hold for 20 minutes and still have not have one person answer the phone. So don't be mean to the staff, call CVS corp and complain to make a difference.< /text>

<Review>This is the first time I have ever actually been inspired to follow through in writing a negative review for anyone. The only reason this pharmacy should even have a star at all is that it provides life saving medicine to people who need it, which is only because it is in fact a pharmacy. I have  been using the CVS pharmacy on 41st Ave. for about 4 years beginning with the birth of my second child. It was the natural choice as it was the only pharmacy nearby with a drive through. It is hard enough being sick, let alone dragging in 2 small children along with you. I have to say the drive through window (despite it's colossally slow wait times) remains the most positive thing about the service  of this pharmacy. Think about that: a physical structure being the best thing about a place where thousands of people come. So, why do I say this? For all the years I've been coming, I have been frustrated by incredibly long wait times whether inside or at the drive through, prescriptions not being ready even after having received text messages that they are, and then having to wait an additional 30-45 minutes for them to get those prescriptions ready, long  wait times for prescriptions to be ready after coming from the doctor's office, and waiting on hold for up to 45 minutes on one occasion to speak to someone in the department. The common complaint I have seems to be wait time. Which is what I kind of expect from a pharmacy to some degree, which is why that drive through window and the potential that I might need it when picking up a prescription has kept me coming back. Until today.
Last night I was prescribed something that I needed to start ASAP and CVS was closed so it got sent to the Walgreens on Freedom. I got to the Walgreens only to discover that they were out of both the medications I needed. Fine, it happens. They told me that I needed to ask my pharmacy to call them to transfer the prescription over to them. I got to CVS first thing this morning (to avoid the dreaded wait time), and was able to speak with someone pretty quickly (a nice change). They said it would be 15-20 minutes for the prescription to be ready ( which honestly does feel much longer - not their fault- with two kids in the car and a full blown case of Influenza A) and one of the medications was. The other wasn't showing up, so I told them what the pharmacist at Walgreens said. The tech at CVS said it would take a bit but they would call when it was ready. No problem. So when I get the call from the pharmacist she says that she called the Walgreens and was on hold for 12 minutes and no one answered so it might be faster for me to ask them to transfer it. I explained that I was there in person last night and asked them to transfer it and that I was clearly instructed that the pharmacy needed to call. Now, I have to admit that my years of frustration may have emerged a bit. She continued on to say it might be faster if I call ( did she not hear me?) To which I told her, no it would not be and that considering the hours I have collectively waited for things from them, couldn't they call back try again. Wasn't it part of what they do at the pharmacy? To which she replied she could not sit and wait on hold for a pharmacist for all that time. To which I replied that I know all about waiting on hold for pharmacists considering I've been using theirs for years. And could I please speak with their manager? Her response was that she would not continue to be verbally abused and hung up on me.
I guess I need to figure something else out for my prescription? I get that whoever I was talking to was not responsible for all of my collective frustration, and that if she was waiting on hold it would be taking her away from other customers who would then be frustrated by having to wait. I also realized that I may be overly agitated as a result of having a fever and feeling generally miserable. My frustrations have spanned years and are countless. Being hung up on is the final straw.< /Review>< user_name>

Very short staffed, unreasonably long wait times. Pharmacy staff have sent me in circles from line to line rather than handling everything in one go. And there is visible debris on the floor of the pharmacy from the counter. Over all, negative experience.< /review>

Late night Friday, Rx refill, my pharmacy Rite Aide was closed so I was directed to go to CVS.  The challenge was, observing the poor training the staff is given to assist customers.  A tech initiated the transaction with me only to ask her associate to step in with out as much as a nod to me, after 4 minutes of collection my personal information.  I watched as she proceeded to tie up half full garbage bags while the young man who took over for her started the process from the beginning with me.  He did his best, which was a challenge for him, for some reason, it took several trips to the back room and a consult with the first tech to get my name in the system before I was informed it would take 20 to 30 minutes to fill the script.  I admit I am used to another system where I am on file, however,  Rite Aide has definitely got it down for customer service.  More training prior to leaving young folks on the floor to provide service to customers who could be in distress seems like a simple solution.  The pick up went flawlessly, a young woman who seemed fresh and focused was very helpful and made the experience less stressful...< /review>

Place is pretty standard, however their pharmacy is on the slow side. Been quoted inaccurate times and they never seem to actually be ready when they are supposed to.</text>

Terrible pharmacy.  When you call you're taken through multiple menus to get to a person.  Then you'll inevitably be put on hold for 15 min (while you're forced to listen to an awful, distorted recording the same Liberace-esque elevator music they've had on there for years).  Very nice employees who are trying their best, but honestly, go to Tom's, a very nice local pharmacy where you can talk to real people the first time you call, there's never a line of more than one or two people, and you're supporting a local business.

Also, while I'm on this rant, CVS takes up to 24 h to refill a prescription even if you need it immediately, there are always long lines, and they have little flexibility when it comes to special requests and issues. We transferred to Tom's a year ago and are very happy (the reason I'm writing this is that my doc accidentally filled a new prescription at CVS and I had to got through the whole routine all over again.  Ugh!)</review>

<Text>Can I give a lower rating?  After multiple delays and phone calls and being put on hold for seemingly endless durations, I walk over to pick up my prescription and still cannot get it.  Should it take 3 or more days to get a prescription?  This is the 3rd time in 2 years that I have had a difficult time getting a prescription filled.  (I have not yet had a good experience with this pharmacy.)   I will never, ever attempt to get a script filled here again.  Franks Pharmacy, in Aptos, has never given me a problem.  I will drive farther to get good service.  I cannot stress enough that CVS pharmacy has horrible service, consistently makes mistakes, and makes everything as frustrating as possible.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>The staff aka pharmacists are not up to date on how to use the new Covered California System. I was told my card id number was inactive. Upon further questioning the pharmacist said it was not the id number but that the prescription was not covered.

His statement, if I had not questioned him further, would have cost me hours of hassle on the phone with Anthem BC. He just didn't care. I will go somewhere else next time.< /text><response>None< /response>< user_id>

Not even worthy of one star. My daughter was diagnosed with pneumonia, I dropped off her prescriptions (after waiting for hours in the E.R.) The girl at the counter said to come back in 20 minutes. Drove the cliffs and circled back around to go through the drive through, only to be told that I have to wait an HOUR because the pharmacist went on lunch. Needless to say horrendous experience-  HATED IT!!  ON TOP OF THAT THEY DIDN'T FILL THE ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIPTION COMPLETELY, they shorted my daughter on a days worth of antibiotics. I am so livid, I could spit!
Shame on this pharmacy.<//Text>

Omg! I've eaten alot of different foods but I must say this spot is one of my favorites! I ordered the tater tots with bbq and sour cream Seasoning and it was amazing! I also had the chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce it was the best! If you love potatoes like I do you must try this place!<//Review>

The pros are:

(1) the price is reasonable, starting $2.50 per load in the normal or small white washers,

(2) a coin change machine for quarters,

The cons are:

(1) they do NOT provide a restroom for customers,

(2) the washers do NOT have a 2nd rinse option so you have to pay twice ro run your clothes thru twice if you want a second rinse cycle.</Text>

< review>
This place is one of the most expensive laundromats in Palm Springs and there's always this one pertain that comes sand takes all the machines! The attendant only helps this person and leaves the place unattended and has an attitude if you give him suggestions.  It is super uncomfortable trying to Load your dryer when someone is touching you while folding! She almost got my head! The owners don't have a contract number and are terrible at accounting for lost and found. If I'm paying an extra quarter on every machine i expect a little respect and common courtesy regarding the use of machines! If there's a sign that states to remove your clothes from machines as soon as possible and even your attendant is defiant regarding that rule you have disorder. Just saying.<//review>

I would give a negative Stars if I could this laundromat is horrible. I just had a horrible experience with in there and I don't know his name but he's a Latino and and he absolutely insulting me and offended me and I'm handicapped I know I went past 10:00 but I didn't realize that at the time because he let me without any warning of needing to leave at a certain time just all of a sudden he was telling me I had to get out and I told him I was going as fast as I can he just kept yelling hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry.  you can't treat people like this especially someone handicapped. I told him I was handicapped and I needed help and I was trying to do the best I'm crying right now I'm shaking and can't drive. my clothes are ruined this the worst experience I've ever had using a laundromat<//Text>

{'time': 1598279455357, 'text': 'Tyler,\nGood news! I was able to review the video tape of your time in the coin laundry. Bad news, your description above does not match what I witnessed on the video tape.  After spending an extended time in your vehicle, rather than attending to your laundry, you demanded to stay in the facility well after closing time. The attendant did not yell at you, did not raise his voice to you, but did give you a ten minute warning to leave ten minutes after closing time. As the owner, I ask the staff to do just that, but I do not authorize overtime for customers who choose to leave the facility then show up late and expect us to accommodate them.\n\nUnfortunately, you did raise your voice, you did curse at the staff, and you did act inappropriately. Although we respect our customers and strive to keep our facility open and available to all, inappropriate behavior towards staff is not tolerated. I wish you well as you seek other local laundries to meet your needs.'}<//resp>

This place is awesome. As far as laundromats go, this is one of the better places you can go to. The place is clean, thr machines generally are all in working order. Prices are reasonable. Seems like a very well run business.< /Text>

When visiting Palm Springs this is my go to laundry spot.  Clean and convenient. New equipment. From ATM, bill changer, coin changer, laundry supplies and snacks - everything you need. My routine is go in the morning, get laundry running - walk around the corner to Jelly Doughnut and get a pastry while clothes are washing.

Had one issue where a machine ate my money - they mailed me a refund in Washington DC.  They take care of their customers / even ones that may obviously not be regulars.< /text>

I wouldn’t give any stars if I could.

From what I’ve just heard, they tell mothers to leave their babies in the car.  Thankfully, I don’t need their services.

I had a very pleasant visit and was treated professional. Having never used this laundromat. Not knowing how much.or how long it takes for blankets or comforters I was truly surprised at the attendants kindness. She took time away from a vendor to explain.
To me this would be my goto place.
Thank you.<//text>

<Text>This is my fav laundromat. I come from desert hot springs and it's worth it. Never overly crowded. Not too pricey. Always clean. Down side is no vending machines for snacks or drinks. No bathrooms either which sucks because I'm pregnant but considering all the homeless people that hang around outside I understand. Typically takes me about 30 minutes for a load to wash and depending on the items I bring 28-21 minutes to dry. Plenty of folding space. I'm almost always in and out pretty quickly.<//Text>< UserId.>

Their coin machines don't work.  I just lost a twenty and my clothes are dirty.  I noticed everyone was struggling with all the coin machines.  I bet I never see my money again.  You have such a simple business.  Change machines and Washer/Dryers.  Fix your change machines and learn how to run a business.</Text>

We have an equipment emergency line to call-text posted in the store but maybe you did not notice that.  I hope you also  saw that refund slips are available in the store, we process refunds right away. It's unfortunate you felt the need to leave a review without giving us the opportunity to address your concerns, had you called we could have tried to connect with you while you were there."}</response>

This laundromat was close to where i lived so i went to do laundry there. There were ample machines but people left laundry in the dryers and left so that meant dryers were limited and im not one to take someones clothes out. Overall it was clean and safe.< /text>

Very clean inside, and the machines are clean and in great condition as well! There's also a large selection of machines so you can get in and out pretty quickly. I would highly recommend giving it a try!< /Text>

< Review>
I was here at 9: 27 July 27th 2019 the past three times I've been here it's been the same same guy
twice now he's vandalize my laundry with chemicals I would suggest if you're white to stay away from this place it seems the owners and employees are extremely racist.. sad that we're living in Palm Springs California and this is how they choose to operate their business.<//Review>

<Review>Just went today and I'm so glad I listen to my 5 yr old to stop. The burritos are not like your ordinary burritos but they are awesome and filled with meet. The place was clean smelled fresh. She was very friendly  and very nice.(I think she was the owner,didn't get a name) Definitely will re visit. My boy loved his Happy Halloween baggie that she gave him.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Highly recommend this restaurant. Food was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! The service was quick and the customer service focused.  Everyone is friendly—just what I would expect. The portions are generous and the prices are out of this world. If you ever find yourself in Clarksburg, stop and enjoy the food. You won't be disappointed.< /Text>

Dropped off my Ford Escape to replace my ignition tumbler, the A/C compressor and even had it smogged as well. Great family owned company with great service.</Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>I've been going to Lake Auto and Smog since they first opened in Lake Elsinore back in 2015. They have helped my family with countless car issues ranging from simple oil changes and smog inspections to an entire engine and clutch replacement on one vehicle and rebuilding an axle assembly on another. They have helped sort out complicated electrical problems, ignition issues, and replaced parts from motor mounts to sensors, belts, hoses and more. They have been very honest, transparent and trustworthy and we have recommended them many times and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</text>< response>

You told me you were going to drive the vehicle around to try to get it ready for smog but never mentioned what time you were coming back.

Don’t come here! The guy told my mom to bring her car back before 2 PM. When we got there 15 minutes before 2 he was locking up. Mom mentioned to him about him telling her to come back before 2 and he just shrugged his shoulders and said we closed. Poor customer service!<//review>

I like this store, its pretty clean and the workers are very nice. Im surprised the mens section has some pretty good cloths especially jackets, socks and underwear items. Also love their little garden and car section you'd be surprised what you'll find</text>

I had Ashley, the sales associate do a return transaction for me. Her customer service is very poor. She had a bad attitude the whole time. she told me I could not return items with no tags, but for the one of the shirts I was returning, I was told I am able to return it even it was originally missing the price tag. She did not carefully reference the items on the receipt and sternly stated one item does not match the description. Lady, you are looking at wrong item on the receipt! Another lady, I am assuming is the manager came over to assist. She also told me I could not return as well until I pointed out the item description on the receipt to her. In the end she approved the refunds and I was issued my money back. Ashley shoved the receipts to me and in a nasty tone said, "Bye~~!!" It was a, "You are not worth my time, get out of my face," kind of attitude.

I used to enjoy shopping here, but now the customer service has gone down hill. If I could, I would not give any stars.<//text>

<Review>Very rude curly haired hispanic girl who yelled at me for coming in the store with a return bag. I was not aware that I had to do the return first before shopping, she could have told me in a professional manner but lacked the customer service skills. She was very hostile and made me feel very uncomfortable. I expected better from my favorite Ross location.< /Review></record>

TRASH BAG experience.

I really like this store, they usually have good collection compared to other ROSS stores around but today (01/13/2020) I was there and while I was checking out they said they ran out of bags so they offering trash bags. I mean TRASH BAGS, really. It's the management's fault that they did not order the bag on time so they ran out of it. But just imagine you are coming out of store with a Trash Bag. It is so funny and sad.</Text>

<Text>You can always find good deals at Ross. Found mens Levi pants for $22-24 each. When we were at Sears 10 min earlier, Levies were on Sale buy one get one 50% off but each pair of pants was $60. Saved ourselves about $50. The line was long but not too long of a wait, they had plenty of cashiers and they were fast and good customer service.<//Text>< Name>

Very very bad experience. Remember there is restroom,  but The restroom is not available for customers every time you went to the store . Just go other Ross instead of this one in Southland mall.<//Text>

Not sure why I go back.  About once a year I go to Ross with renewed optimism that things will have improved.  I went within the 1st two hours they were open on New Years day and the racks were still well organized.  Got my items went to check out there was a line with 3 people in it and the normal que that snakes around so I start to follow it and then I realize that there isn't a cashier.  So I back up past  and go to the other line passing an employee switching out displays.  I patiently wait when two other people get in line with me so that are now 6 people in this line.  After about 5 minutes the employee switching out displays says that line is for returns only.   I point out there was only one cashier and she said I can open up and 6 or the 7 people now in line went over to her.   She announces that they are out of bags.  Hopefully things will improve in the next year.<//text>

The supervisor was there taking her sweet time closing out another register.  I want to call corporate office so bad to file a complaint but decide not to . But yes it was very frustrating waiting in line with around 20 customers with 4 employees and only one was working.<//Review>< Name>

<Review>This a a big store, you can find almost anything you expect to by in any ross store. Customer service and counters need so much improvement. At one time there was only one cashier for 28+ people waiting for checkout, she was a bit slow but you cannot blame her. Working by yourself with no help in a big ross store on a weekend makes you tires and slow. The management probably does not care about customers and the traffic in the store.< /Review>< Pics>

I was pregnant I had an emergency to urinate and I asked the person in charge to allow me to use the bathroom that was an emergency and she answered me in a very rude way saying no.  I had to endure until I reached other baths and after urinating I felt a pain to endure the desire.  They are bad people.  I had never asked to go to the bathroom because I know they don't lend it but because of the pregnancy I had a lot of need and they treated me badly.  I don't want to know anything about that store I still remember and I'm sad that employees treat the customer like that.<//review>

I'm sorry but I do not shop at the Southland Mall ROSS STORE.  I was there xmas eve shopping. It was almost time for the stores to close. There were 5 employee's standing up in front talking to each other. There was only ONE(1) person working the checkout counter. The line was very long. I noticed one worker helped One(1) customers out. But then went back to talking to the other employee's. I was very upset. It seems only person who cared about there job was the only girl working the registers. I shop at the Fremont Hub Ross & the Ross in Newark in the same parking lot as Safeway. Both are NICE & CLEAN. I found a beautiful black patent leather GUESS PURSE.  In The picture I took the black was so shinny you can't make out that its a purse.. Love it.💓😎🌴</Review>

<username>Jessica Tru</username><Date>1355682640744</Date><text>This is not a Ross that I like to shop at but since Ross always have good stuff for super cheap, I come and see if this one has anything good. But most of the time I come here, there's nothing really good. The staff never asks if you need help, never get greeted. Things are always so messy, and dirty. They def need more friendly staff that knows how to keep the place nice and clean. The lines are always long because the cashiers rings people up SUPER slow. So by the time it gets to me, I don't even feel like buying anything anymore.< /text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) They do not lend you the bathroom
You have to leave the store to find a bathroom and go back to shopping, they always say it is out of order
That is very inconvenient and more if you bring children

(Original)
No te prestan el baño
Tienes que salir de la tienda a buscar baño y volver a seguir con tus compras, siempre dicen que está fuera de servicio
Eso es muy inconveniente y más si traes niños</review>
