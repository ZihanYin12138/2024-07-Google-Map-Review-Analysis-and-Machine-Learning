Unfortunately, after getting a cut I started receiving texts and emails "reminding" me to book an appointment. I hate to criticize a corporate decision on a page dedicated to a single location, but this does negatively affect the likelihood that I will return to any Floyd's for my next haircut.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>For the most part haircuts are done well. Forgot the name of a young lady who did my gf's hair awhile back and she loved it. Came back to get another haircut looking for her specifically but was told she left so my gf got assigned to someone else. Waste of money. This guy barely did anything to her hair. I literally sat there for over an hour watching him just toss and comb and barely snip anything at all. She specifically asked for an inch and a half with thinning, he didn't even come close... Pretty much paid for wasted time.</Text><Name>Tracy Tiongson< /Name>< gmapID>

My boyfriend comes here often, so it was the first thing out of his mouth when I woke up complaining how badly I needed a haircut. I walked in there without an appointment and they sat me in Nona's chair. Now, first time haircuts can make most of us feel a little anxious but Nona was sweet and put me right at ease. I'd been working like a crazy person all week, so I wasn't super social while I sat there and Nona didn't push. In thirty minutes, my hair looked amazing and I will definitely be back!< /Review>

Horrible place. I walked in and there were 3 guys in front of me so I waited. I could see the barbers (males and females) coming to the front to ask who was next. They immediately took care of them. When it came to my turn I heard the guy pointing at me and mentioning my name. So they looked at me and went and did something else like drinking something or going out and to make a call. Waited for 15 more minutes and nothing. I just a
Walked out.  I'm in my fifties and partially bald so maybe they thought I was a waste of time. I'm always very generous with tipping when people do a good job in any trade.  Maybe I'm not "hip" enough. Well, you lost a good client. See you NEVER ....< /review>

<review>I had the pleasure of having Kenny cut my hair. He was very professional and gave me good advice.  Both hair and beard looked exactly the way I wanted.  Great job!  I highly recommend him</review>< gmapID>

I went in yesterday to get a cut and color and had a wonderful experience! Shai was so great! I had an idea of the color I wanted and a picture of the cut and he suggested some variations that he thought would look good on me. It all turned out perfectly!

He was also very knowledgeable about products that would work for my specific hair type and gave advice on the easiest ways to get different types of curls and waves.  I definitely recommend Shai!<//Text>

Lauren or Lon or whatever her name was completely ignored what I asked for and just cut my hair buzz-cut short on the sides, and left me exactly the same as when I came in but shorter. There are probably good hairstylists there who listen to what you ask from them, but she is not one of them. BE CAREFUL, do your homework, and make sure the stylist knows what you mean, or you'll end up feeling dumb like I do for not doing more homework...<//review>

<Review>Awesome!! Authentic Mexican food just Open recently. This is even better than the location in SB.  Meat is Fresh.... Always love the Marinated pork (El. Pastor) Yummy on my Tummy!!!... either for Tacos & Mulitas like the quesadillas. A bit pricey but it's worth it!!! Best in SB county. Both locations are closed on Tuesdays.....No Taco Tuesdays... Lol... Enjoy the New Experience..🙏❤️💯💞👍😘<//Review><username>Marivic</username><user_id>114218306862295847327</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Drive thru was very slow. The Asada is absolutely tasteless. The Adobada was just ok. My favorite were the Chorizo tacos, very flavorful and worth going back for. Too much guacamole on the tacos. Just thought it could have been faster for just being tacos. Plenty of taco places have better tacos. I don't see what people see in this place cause it was highly recommended.</text>

Make sure you have patience when ordering bc it will be a while. I only go for the Alpastor, which is the best Alpastor I ever had🔥 & their always packed with meat. The Carne asada is okay but I've had better. I've never had the chicken because I'm stuck on the Alpastor. They call it "Adobada" though when you order. Make sure to tell them no guacamole if you're not a fan of guacamole bc the Adobada tacos comes with guacamole. I would've gave them 5 🌟 but they always take a long time to give you your order no matter the time of the day.<//Text>

<Review>Although this place has "B" for not having refrigerators working properly and not knowing how to properly handle meat. The young ladies on D.T. have lack of costumer service. Also make sure you double check your order is right, last time we went there we only got lemons and radishes.</Review>< pics>

Ordered 3 tacos total was suppose to be $7 and change once I saw my transaction when I got home it was $10 and change, didn’t ask for a receipt because was in a rush since I was waiting in the drive thru order for 10 min and no one replied so had to place my order in the window. Won’t be going their anymore<//review>

Finally a taco spot with Adobada!! I've only had Adobabda from Tacos El Gordo in Vegas and these are pretty comparable. The adobabda here is charred but not burnt and not dry either. Super flavorful. Their salsas are lacking flavor. I wish they had a green salsa. I love that they have a drive thru.< /text>

I did not know such place existed in California where the tacos taste exactly like tacos from TJ, Mexico. I swear I am not lying!!!!! Tacos are made with handmade tortillas and the asada had a charcoal flavor.... you must order the ones that come with everything because they add guacamole 🥑, cilantro and onion. Also stick with carne asada, 👌🏼 it’s delicious here, I’m pretty sure they actually barbecue it and not cook it like any other tacos place. I normally order cabeza or alpastor mulitas but their Asada has the best flavor I’ve ever tasted so just order asada.<//text>

I love the tacos here they are fantastic they make the best tacos I've had in so California I wish they would consider the high desert in their future expansions there are plenty of vacant fast food restaurants in the high desert like a del taco on bear Valley rd and a burger King on 7th street and a carls Jr or something like that on mariposa rd which isn't too far from the vacant del taco I would definitely be  a regular there if you came to the desert<//Review>

The adoba doesn't come with hand made tortillas or the same guac.

Drinks are all glass bottles Mexican style sodas just FYI and default language spoken is language is Spanish. Do not be alarmed they speak English it's just to add to the authenticity/culture.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

As soon as you walk in you are standing in line, as cashier is straight ahead. They only have tacos and mulitas and drinks. We ordered Asada and Adobada (al-pastor) tacos. The size is smaller than regular tortilla but slightly larger than a small street taco tortilla. The asada taco comes with onions, cilantro, avacado, and salsa( red, spicy but not much). To us the tacos were good with a good charcoal flavor. The Adobada tacos lacked juiciness and the sauce for that wasn't as flavorful as other places.

I tried the carne asada and chicken, and they were both delicious. They have such an authentic taste. They actually remind of a taco spot down in Rosarito, Tacos El Yaqui. I would definitely recommend this spot. It's a new location and is very clean inside, the only thing I would recommend adding is a variety salsa bar.</review>< rate>

<Review>This place will always be near and dear to my heart. I spent most of my childhood weekends and summers at Camp Hamilton. I remember the first time I went to the camp it was nothing but rolling hills and the old storage unit. I have too many memories here with Uncle Glenn . Many, many stories to tell. That picture in the bar of Uncle Ernie and my Nino Tony after they set the hills on fire was just hilarious. It was always myself my two brothers, little Glenny, Sara, Angela and the dogs. We were the ORIGINAL camp "brat pack". My grandfather has a tree, and I respect and honor any person who has ever worn a dog tag and the families attached to them. Camp Hamilton Forever...
p.s. The Bodfish trips were awesome... Gotta Love those Bevys!!!</Review>< UserId.>

I have been going to Movement Warehouse classes for a year now. Mike and his trainers have helped me lose over 100 lbs and gain my health and ability to do the things I love in life back. I had never lifted a weight in my life. The trainers helped me learn from square 1 instead of pushing me to fast to hard. The community has been so supportive and I always look forward to each strength and training class! Thanks guys!</text>

<Text>Hands down the best gym in San Diego! Mike will get you the results you are looking for. He is very meticulous and takes the time to ensure that you're getting the most out of your workout. He will modify any workout to suit your needs and always has an upbeat and can-do attitude. Every workout is different, and he definitely keeps you wanting to come back for more. This is the only gym I would ever recommend.</Text><UserId.>109887497674343299510</UserId.><username>Chris Fuentes<//username>< date>

< Review>
LOVE LOVE this gym! I’ve tried out a few gyms in San Diego and this is by far my favorite.  The trainers know their stuff and will help you with form while also pushing you throughout the workout.  Also being in sunny San Diego, they have the majority of the gym outside on a grass turf. You won’t find anything else like this San Diego, 10/10 recommend!!< /Review>

<Review>I think one of the biggest failures of gyms/classes/workouts is the connection you develop with the establishment. I've been to many different styles and formats of exercise and not many compare to what Michael and his team have built here at the Movement Warehouse.

One of the biggest thing I've been looking forward for has been the sense of community while working out. You can argue that other places like F45, Orange-theory, Crossfit or any other gym has this, but I would challenge that sentiment when comparing to the Movement Warehouse. The moment you walk into the facility you are welcomed and greeted like a regular by Michael and the coaches. This is so important in the journey of reaching your fitness goals. Familiarity breeds comfort. Comfort breeds consistency. Consistency breeds results. I've lost 20 lbs since joining there in a time period of 6 months.

The programs are challenging, but satisfying and each completed day is greater sense of fulfillment. I go to the Movement Warehouse because of the people involved and the members who attend. Everyone who steps through that door shows a true passion to betterment - physically and mentally.

Shout out to Meaghan, Brad and Andrea for all the great coaching and Nate for helping out as the manager.

Special shout out to Michael for all your hustle and the family you've built.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc01c01c5103af:0x719063b700938f18<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

The Movement Warehouse is a phenomenal outdoor workout facility that not only makes you feel safe during COVID but also has created a great community. All the coaches there are highly trained and design the best workouts possible. They are all very knowledgeable about the body and are able to tailor the workouts to your specific needs. They do a great job of creating a myriad of different exercises so you never get bored with the workouts! I highly recommend this place!! They’re amazing!!<//Text>

I never EVER thought I'd love going to the gym but here I am, 7 months into being a member at MVMT and I don't ever want to stop. This place is awesome and truly combines safety, community, and hard work in a fun way.

No matter the trainer, you will have an excellent workout that pushes ya beyond what you thought you could do. Meagan and Mike will not hesitate to  correct your form, call ya out for slacking, and generally just push you. Brad and Andrea will encourage ya one moment, and the next push you to take that extra bit of weight or do a few more reps. They are all great.

Pricing here is pretty affordable for what ya get: the expertise of amazing trainers without the price tag (unless ya want that 1 on 1!) and unlimited classes with the right membership.

If you're looking for a new place to workout (that takes covid seriously too), join a community, and generally better yourself, sign up. It'll be worth it.</Text>

<Review>I have been a member at The Movement Warehouse for over two years now, Both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic (when outdoor activities were allowed). Their cleaning and sanitization protocols have given me the confidence to continue to workout through the pandemic.

The staff, lead by Mike, is professional, courteous, very knowledgeable, they are easy to work with and funny. All of their other patrons also seem to enjoy the atmosphere at the gym often staying after workouts to stretch and chat.  Today, at 39, I am in the best shape of my life, stronger and leaner than ever!

I would without a doubt recommended The Movement Warehouse as the best choice in Pacific Beach and La Jolla for your workouts!< /Review><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

You won't find any of that here. The instructors are experienced, professional, and personally invested in the quality of both your experience and your outcomes.

<review>Hi! I’ve been going to MVMT since July. Before that I was just running on my own which was really boring and then my hair lady referred me to MVMT (shout out Cindy at Split Ends). I started out doing personals with Michael and told him I would only lift once, MAYBE twice a week tops. Now I do classes like every day and have gotten into great shape..depending on which trainer you ask.

The workouts are GREAT. I used to get tired of doing the same thing over and over, but MVMT’s workouts are different every day with each day having a focus on specific muscle groups. They’re great for all strength levels, beginner to athlete. The trainers are all fantastic, definitely hot, and motivate the hell out of you (in a fierce but loving way). The community at MVMT is even hotter and they’re all so much fun to sweat with. I kinda suck but I’ve made lots of new friends! (plus, no one judges you - something I always worried about in gyms).

I can’t recommend this place enough. I’ve become addicted to working out there and I used to hate exercising. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

< Review>
This is gonna be a super long review but I cannot say enough great things about this gym. I moved to San Diego 3 years ago and I have been to many gyms around the area, CrossFit, F45, kickboxing, etc. I can 100% say this gym is everything I have been looking for and more. The people are friendly and inclusive, the trainers know their stuff and will push you while somehow making it fun, and the owner made me feel like I was at home from day one. The workouts are all outside and they even have racks set up so you can still get those gains. I used to get so sore from CrossFit that I would skip days at the gym. I also felt like I was never getting enough cardio. The programming at this gym incorporates heavy lifting with HIIT training so you can build muscle and also burn fat, increase your flexibility and mobility, and make your training sustainable.  They also have yoga a couple times a week! I am no fitness expert but I ran collegiate track and field and did CrossFit for 5 years, and this is by far the best programming I’ve seen. They also have a variety of times for their classes (I am a nurse and have a weird work schedule). They did a great job transitioning with every new change occurring in today’s world and there’s plenty of sanitation bottles and time to clean. I could go on and on but going to these work outs have been the highlight of my day, and I’ll hope to see y’all there!</Review>

This review is well overdue. I have been with The Movement Warehouse for 2+ years because a coworker asked me to go and I have been hooked ever since. I was always hesitant about group workout classes due to previous sports injuries and I needed to ensure someone focused on my form. Mike, Meagan, and Dani are amazing and always help when needed. They know my injuries and will create a modification for me when necessary. The great thing about the modification is that it's not any easier. It's still an exercise that pushes me without the pain and I don't feel any less accomplished.

Mike has cultivated a fitness community that goes well beyond just diet and exercise. The Movement Warehouse is a family of people that all want to better themselves in one way or another. We also have a TON of FUN while doing it. Not only do we enjoy our workouts together, but there are events outside of the classes that happen. There are social events, yoga classes, game nights, and other wellness gatherings that help you connect with people.

The Movement Warehouse community is filled with people from various workout, athletic, and health and fitness backgrounds and levels. The one constant is we all love to come here and we all appreciate the work they put in to help us improve. I am faster, stronger, and more flexible since joining and I am truly appreciative of everything they have done since I joined.

Mike, Meagan, and Dani are amazing and I know they can't wait to help you meet and surpass your goals.<//text>

< Review>
I started at the Movement warehouse because of their fun ever changing sign that they have outside, which lead to me peaking into the window and noticing a diverse group of people completing a challenging work out but SMILING and LAUGHING through it.  I had been gym shopping for a while i tried working with other trainers and gyms since my move form Nashville to San Diego 2 and a half years ago, nothing seemed to be able to get me to feel comfortable enough or made me want to come back more than this place.  This review is a bit of a love letter to this gym, because after i moved to San Diego I am quite possibly the only person who got less fit after moving to the fittest city in the US, but after joining this gym I was able to lose 20 of the 30 lbs that i put on in 2 years.  Mike, Meagan, and Cali go a long way in terms of not only training you but making you apart of the community so you commiserate  with everyone you are working out with.  they also really listen and try to help you overcome your limitations safely.  Meagan is even a nutritionist, and nutrition was something that I truly needed to focus on.  I love walking past the gym while walking my dog Hero because even he is made to feel like a member of the gym community with the HELLO HERO he receives as we pass by.  This gym is a true family and you feel that energy while you work out.  the workouts will always be challenging, expect that, but the atmosphere makes you want to come back for more.  I went from feeling like I was neither fit or strong enough to be at this gym to feeling like i am a person who does fitness and health because this community helped me to grow!< /Review>

I highly recommend the Movement Warehouse to anyone that is looking to take their health an fitness to the next level!

I've taken a few classes at The Movement Warehouse and am loving it!
Mike knows his stuff and it shows in his training style. He starts with a solid warm-up/movement prep to get the body loose and get the heart rate up. The workouts are programmed well to include a variety of functional movements that tie strength training and cardio together. Mike does a great job of keeping you motivated throughout the workout while keeping the class fun and upbeat.

The community at The Movement Warehouse is unparalleled. The clients love being there and they welcome in newbies with open arms. It can be intimidating to walk into a new gym or fitness studio, but here, you feel like part of the family almost instantly.<//review>

The Movement Warehouse is unlike any place I have ever worked out...  and I have worked out many places.  From day one, my interaction with Mike and his clients being welcoming and friendly followed by a kickass workout I committed and have been now for over a year.  I’ve lost lost weight and decreased body fat percentage... more import I have kept if off and continue to do so while MOST importantly having FUN!  I’m stronger, more flexible and feel amazing...   the MW brings such great energy and vibe I crave going for the workouts and great people (some now my very close friends).  Mike makes it fun and switches it up with friendly challenges and social events!!  Bringing everyone even closer together motivating each other staying healthy and fit.
SERIOUSLY THE BEST PLACE TO WORK OUT GET AND KEEP RESULTS!!
Thanks Michael😊</text>

The location is great and the facility is indoor outdoor so that makes for a lot of variety in each work out. Sometimes the clases have a lot of folks and other times they are small and intimate. Either way I've never felt and looked better in my life and the people who go there are like family and we get together outside of the gym often. If I are looking for a great work out, great trainers, great facility and great results you need to try out the movement warehouse.<//review>< pictures>

Found the Movement Warehouse about 9 months ago through a couple friends and was talked into giving it a try.  At the time, I was a bit hesitant to go lift weights and jump around the gym in what I assumed to be a "cross fit" atmosphere since I was coming off a recent back surgery.  Boy was I wrong.

The team of trainers (led by head trainer Mike) are amazing to work with.  Have an old injury that's holding you back?  There's a way to train and eliminate risk of re-injury with this team.  They always have your best interest in mind and can recommend alternative exercises if something makes you uncomfortable or is a health risk for you.  The folks that workout here are an amazing group and are super welcoming, really incredible people.

After 9 months, the results are amazing!  My core strength is stronger than ever which has accelerated the results of my back surgery, my upper body has actual defined muscles which I haven't seen in 10 years, and the lower/leg workouts have increased my mobility and racing speed.

Bottom line, if you are looking for results, look no further than The Movement Warehouse.  If you are willing to put in the time and trust with this team, you will get stronger, faster, and live a healthier lifestyle as a result.

Final thought for those with a difficult schedule, The Movement Warehouse has amazing hours ranging from 530a-630p and weekend classes which makes it incredibly easy to get into the gym 4-6x per week.

Recommend 100 times over.<//Text>

<review>I've never worked out at a gym like this before, and I've tried a lot of different specialty gyms and regular gyms alike. Both the community and the workouts are something you'll NEVER get bored of and you can feel good about your work outs, instead of just saying "I worked out" and it realistically being sub-par. You won't regret joining this gym-community!< /review><Name>Olivia Lepore<//Name>< resp>

<Text>Movement Warehouse is an amazing workout, and an even more amazing community. I love that there's a proper warm-up included in the one hour workout, which is a mix of cardio to get your heart-rate going, mobility exercises and stretches. This is so important to make sure you don't get injured jumping right into a heavy lift. I really like that there's a variety in classes, and that the days are slip into body parts. Mike and his trainers are always paying attention to make sure you're doing proper form. Its really more of a group personal training session with lots of attention which I love. Also, its the best way to make like-minded friends since many of the workouts are completed in small groups, or with a partner. Do yourself, and your body, a favor and check out a workout!< /Text>< user>

The Movement Warehouse is an insanely awesome gym! As someone who can sometimes lack a little motivation to work out as hard as I can,  being in the gym with Mike (owner & head trainer) it's impossible not to feel juiced. Mike is incredibly knowledgeable about fitness, and having that expert next to you motivating you to work harder and work smarter, you truly realize that this is how to workout.  For anyone from a couch potato to a pro athlete, Mike will help take you to the next level -- I know he has for me!</text>

<Review>Movement Warehouse is the best gym in PB!! I feel so much stronger, faster and more mobile since joining last year. Mike the owner is so knowledgeable, welcoming and pushes you to be better everyday. He hired 2 other trainers Mike and Meagan who are equally awesome! This gym is a great fit whether you are totally new to working out or an avid athlete. They help tailor the exercises to fit your needs. Movement Warehouse is a class based gym all circuit training style. And no it’s NOT cross fit...it’s way better! They have movement (more cardio based) and strength (higher weight lower reps) classes and you can mix and match which ever type of class you want. There are plenty of classes offered each day and each day has a designated focus ex Monday’s are leg day, Tuesday upper body, Wednesday cardio and core and so forth. The point is you work out every part of your body and not just to get all bulked up. The workouts are geared to increase strength and mobility (hence why it’s better then CrossFit). Oh and the cherry on top is the community! I love all the people that workout there and they have become some of my closest friends! Welcoming, hard working, supportive and fun. Come join us!< /Review><user>101820095750736090244</user></record>

<resp>{'time': 1507064389685, 'text': "Hi John. I'm sorry you had a poor experience at our facility. I generally pride myself on delivering high quality workouts with focus on form and safe movement patterns. If you had asked I would have let you know that there is private client parking in the back. As far as repetitive, that is how the body builds muscle and grows (or leans out), 3-4 sets of 6-12 reps is ideal for most individuals (depending on your goals). I honestly don't have you in my system or on a manual waiver so if you'd be willing I'd love to have you back in for another workout. Cheers."}< /resp>< Time>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Paradis has an amazing layout, good outdoor seating and exceptional service. I'm not a huge fan of most of the non-dairy and vegan options personally for their frozen delights, but do enjoy stopping by for the atmosphere, personality and catching up with friends. They have some great treats of the baked good variety as well as boardgames and other wonders you'll only find at P.I.C. of S.O.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>I found this place today on my little walk trough Sherman Oaks . Not only is the ice cream amazing but the great experience that came with it . Justin the young gentleman managing the store is the sweetest person . He explained all the flavors and ingredients and just great customer service all around .
I will for sure come back and can only highly recommend this place !!!< /review><Name>Eve< /Name>< userid>

They make my absolute favorite Ice cream (the only ice cream I ever eat). I always get the saffron rose water and it is just so light and delicate. They have original choices and then some more specialized ones. I do have to say the inside is very out-dated. The first time I walked in there I was so confused because it looked old and gross and I thought how could anything this good come from this dump.</Text>< pictures>

4/5...the menu is a little light on options but what they have is very tasty.  They have a moderate amount of flavor options with some good seasonal options.  The 4/5 is partly because of the menu depth but also because its right next door to an adult "toy" store.  Parents beware: If you have kids you may have a tough time explaining the sexy underwear on the mannequin's in the window.  Other than that, high quality ingredients, friendly service, fun part of town.< /Review>

First time to this restaurant. Felt like going back in time to the 1950's.  It's not just ice cream, it has a large food menu. Food is okay, service was good. They sing happy birthday to you if it's your birthday.< /review>

The staff is amazing!!! We stumbled upon this place after walking out of Humphrey's disappointed. I pulled up Yelp and Paradis was at the top of the list with 5 stars. The photos sold me right away. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted and noticed games at every table, which was so awesome! The store was super clean, and the staff was incredibly friendly with every customer that walked in the door. Every flavor we tasted was so yummy!!! We can't wait to go back and try a sundae 🤤<//Text>

Don't even waste your time over there and go straight to paradise.  The ice cream is made fresh daily and the flavors do not disappoint. Carnival cake is super legit.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Samar and grace run this ice cream shop. It has began and gluten free flavors. Flavors change every now and then

Location- on Ventura Blvd corner of van Nuys right next to crave cafe.

Ice cream shop- nice clean owners are friendly and super hospitable. I can’t say nice enough things about them. Each table has games and it’s really family friendly

I’m always here ❤️<//Text>

It was a cool night when we went but it was a warm welcome by the owner. We had our dog with us so we sat outside.  The ice cream was delish. Definitely going back for it again. Parking was on the street so that's the only down side when it gets warm again.</Review>

If you have a problematic ice cream addiction, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. Because you'll end up in a 12 step program if you don't. This place is soooo bomb. They also have THE BEST vegan flavors. I'm not even vegan! But I had to get some. And the owner is sooooo nice.  He literally was willing to let me try every and each flavor.<//review>

<review>Paradis Ice Cream Sherman Oaks is amazing - I can wander around for hours. I often pick up recent best sellers in the used book section for a decent price and find cool, cute gifts for friends upstairs. They also carry envirosak bags, my favorite reusable shopping bag.

And apparently on Sunday evenings, they host a knitting group.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

First time here, and enjoyed it. Took my sister out for  some ice cream 🍨 and stumbled upon this place while walking by. It's very cozy inside,  sitting areas are very nice and have pillows for comfort, they have seating in the back , front , and also a small area in front  they also cater to children with the seating which is a plus.  The young gentleman at the counter was very nice and offered us samples before purchasing which was really good because it gives you a chance to try before purchasing being newbies .They have some really good flavors and  also offer lattes , ice coffee and  things like that. I love the fact that they also have cool little games you can play while u enjoy your ice cream. They also had a photo booth where u can take cool pics but wasnt working at the time. Overall great first experience will definitely be returning.</Review>

Excellent Ice Cream! I walk by this establishment all the time and never try it, I'm so glad I walked in today!! My toddler helped me eat a regular (6 mini scoops of up to 3 flavors). Ice cream was super creamy and just delicious<//Text>

<Review>Unbelievably delicious. No joke, it was so good. Top quality and fresh ingredients. Amazing! The customer service is great, kind and professional. He was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his products. He clearly takes great pride and has integrity. A business you want to support. They have vegan and gluten free options. Nothing is artificial and the portions are huge. A small is 2 huge scoops and only 5 or 6 bucks. Next time I'll probably get the childrens size. I can't believe I'm going on and on about Gelato but it was that good.</Review>< pictures>

Amazing place with a wide assortment of vegan flavors that will blow your socks off! Even if you're not vegan you'll love this place -- they make fresh flavors daily. They also have games you can play with your kids or friends.

One expects the crunch of nuts in a "Double Almond Chocolate   Machiatto (sp?)"ice cream sundae. Upon experiencing the lack of even a single almond sliver in the dish one understands disappointment and chagrin; the concoction gets its name from almond milk. Hence, the machiatto in the name should have been the tell tale hint! I drink my coffee black so I associate machiatto with coffee (cafe machiatto) - the lack of any discernible flavor of coffee also left a sense of unfulfilled want. The one star in this review is for the friendly but apologetic attendant. For those allergic to nuts - of any kind -in the ice cream this place will certainly not let you down. For those who enjoy the crunchiness of nuts, have them add the nuts or seek le paradis in another parlor.</text>

<text>Wonderful experience! I order a medication for my dog’s heart that is hard to find and often has long shipping times. Gary helped me find my order, updated my account and expedited my shipment!

<Review>My dog passed away and I asked the company to stop the refills of her medication via their online chat option. They assured me they would, but my card was still charged and the refills still arrived. For multiple months.  I've reached out multiple times since then via email, via chat, via phone, and cannot get them to refund me the money from all of the refills sent to me.  They have opted to refund one refill, but not the other, even though I was told the refund would be issued. It's been exhausting trying to communicate with anyone at the company who can provide a timeline and answer.< /Review>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I have three dogs and I have an awful time finding the Glucosamine chews that they all love. I know I can always find it here and at a better price than at my vets (which are sold out quite often). Shipping is always fast and it keeps my three pups running. My yellow lab is having some hip problems and when I start to run out and start to ration her Glucosamine, I can always tell as she will start to limp. So, I always come to Entirely Pets to get my Glucosamine for my fur-babies.< /Text>< Pics>

<user_id>112907922758564680600< /user_id><Review>I tried to place an order on line today. As I had problems processing this, I called for customer support. Before I placed the order, I went into my account and redeemed rewards to use towards this order. The customer service rep was totally incompetent. Besides having problems with what I wanted, he proceeded to tell me I did not have a reward in the amount I said. I had taken a snapshot of it, along with getting an email confirming my reward. He basically told me I did not have this reward. After 25 minutes with him on the phone and being totally frustrated, I asked to talk to a supervisor. I was told there wasn’t one there and another person got on the phone. She also told me I did not have this reward and I should have taken a snapshot of it. I told her I had, and that’s where I got the numbers to give them. She made me feel like she was doing me a favor by giving me the $$ value of the rewards. I am very upset and will be calling back to talk to someone higher up the food chain.< /Review>< gmapID>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Excellent products and customer service!  I have ordered from Entirely Pets for years and have always been pleased with their products and customer service, when needed.  I had ordered the large bags of Pure Bites from Amazon in the past, and every time I received my order, the bags had not been packaged properly and were compressed leaving the treats crushed, in crumbs with a lot powder in the bag (because they are freeze-dried, they are more delicate).  I have begun ordering through Entirely Pets, and each time the order arrives promptly, well packed and in perfect condition.  During the last order I tried to place online, the website was experiencing some issues, so I called customer service.  I spoke with Yarisma Contreras, who was wonderful and able to assist me in placing my order quickly over the phone.  Yari was very helpful, professional and efficient.  I am happy any time I can support and recommend other/smaller businesses which offer you great products, prices and customer support like Entirely Pets.

I was in rush looking for the needed medication for my puppies as my Golden Retriever recently gave birth! So grateful to find Entirely Pets with affordable meds and supplies and they delivered! Their website is also user-friendly and I will definitely order again. I recommended them to my friends and they are also very grateful for the quality, price, and convenience they bring!</text>

Same experience as other ONE star disgusted customers. KNOWINGLY sells a product, NOT IN STOCK, and makes me wait weeks to finally call to find out what's going on, only to tell me. " your order is not it stock, and we don't know when it will be." "Would you like to wait, or cancel your order for an immediate refund?" I told them I would like an immediate refund. Had to file a Paypal case over $18? Pretty pathetic business practice over under 20 bucks. Save the "owner" chain apology message for the next chump. -0 star</Text>

Would give this place 0 stars if I could.  Absolutely horrible experience!!  I was charged for an order I never received!!  Emailed customer service who said they would get back to me which they never did!
Then, I called customer service and the person answering the phone was extremely rude and hung up on me when I said I never received an order number in my purchase confirmation or any of the correspondence.  Beware if you are purchasing from this awful company.  I will continue to file complaints and dispute the credit card charge</text>

I received all of my order minus the sterile eye drops, which outlast the eye-wash by at least 2 to 1. I have written to Entirely Pets in the past to that effect. I was billed less, minus the difference. And, I am glad that I got my order in a reasonable amount of time, versus waiting for one item to arrive. I am not entirely sure if the one item will eventually straggle behind. But, you know that Entirely Pets does have people, whom are responsive to my requests, and care about the people whom they support, with their pet supplies. Also, this is a truly personal posting, and is not influenced in any way by Entirely Pets or advertisers for any particular product.< /text>

THE WORST ALL AROUND!  Ordered dog treats. Get email stating your order is on its way. Then get email saying it’s back ordered. A month later my dog tells me to give em a call to inquire where his treats are. I call to get the rudest customer service representative ever. Interrupts me twice, gives me a fake name, gives me a false status of my order, and when I ask to speak with his supervisor he transfers me to a voicemail box(probably his). Find out after speaking with an alleged supervisor that item has been discontinued with there company. When I asked “when were you going to let me know?” he had no answer. This place is clown shoes all the way around. Who hires these clowns?  These incompetent employees must know somebody to get hired or possibly give sexual favors to keep their jobs.<//text>

<Review>Ordered online, the payment was taken immediately out of my account. A month later it's still pending and no emails are returned. This place is a scam. Do not buy.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>First time using Entirelypets for my horse and I was happy with my order. I ordered digestion supplements. At first the order was delayed due to unclear billing information but once I got in touch with them they quickly fixed the problem and got my product in a few days at no additional charge. Staff was very good and response time was good - overall I was very happy. I would definitely order again!<//review>< pictures>

My only concern was the products were shipped in a USPS shipping bag instead of a box as usually was done previously. When i got them the bag was not torn but the contents were crushed. This was due I feel to the way USPS handles their packages (throwing them around and putting heavy Items on top of smaller Items which is a USPS issue where they just don't care about the packages they are entrusted with that is why I use UPS or Fedex). I hope that you return to shipping products in boxes as has been previously done to protect the product.< /Review>

The ducks are great quality and the only reason I give them a 3 star is because the size small was still over 9 inches I was looking for the 4-5 inch ducks I had purchased before. That is all my tiny dog will play with.</text>

Proceed with Caution with EntirelyPets - First I want to say that the mistake on the order was my fault.  I am writing a negative review because of poor customer service.  I ordered a dog door for a new building project.  Of course my contractor got behind schedule and 4 months went by before we needed the door.  The door was not going to work. So since I hadn't even opened the box I thought I would see if I could exchange it.  I contacted EntirelyPets and they informed me that thier return policy is 30 days.  Makes sense, I understand the need for this type of policy.  I explained my situation the the customer service rep said that they would not exchange the door.  I offered to pay a restocking fee and still no.  Seems like they could have accomodated me and made money in the process.  Just bad customer service in my opinion.</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>This company is terrible!

I ordered flea meds for my dog and decided to pay an extra $8.95 for Priority Mail shipping instead of having it shipped for free with Standard First Class shipping, as I was anxious to start the meds on my dog as soon as possible. However, they ended up shipping the package by First Class shipping instead. When I contacted them about receiving a refund for my shipping costs, since they shipped First Class Mail, they completely refused.

They are super nice when you want to place an order. However, once they have your money, they couldn't care less about your business, and are outright rude.<//text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) The appetizers are delicious, the frappe very fluffy and the bionic healthy and tasty. For my afternoon of craving it is an ideal place to satisfy it. I'll be back for the delicious apple with chilito. 😋

<Text>Josh is very professional but the most important very sweet person. After having troubles with water heater for 4 years he solved it within few hours.
Entire team was very efficient and sensitive to our family trying to help as soon as possible. Thanks so much! 5++++ starts and going to schedule another project with them next week ❤️< /Text>< pictures>

My husband and I had a concern for our new water heater and the water that was being dispensed outside our home. Josh was very receptive to coming back to address the issue. He was thorough with his assessment and made some minor adjustments to our problem. I'm glad to know that we won't need to stress about upsetting our neighbors anymore.< /text>

Kevin did a great got scheduling and keeping me updated on when the technician would be coming by. I like that they send a picture of the tech with the updates. Rick is a licensed technician who really knows his Noritz tankless water heaters, which is what I was having issues with. He did a good job explaining the issue and what I could do better in maintaining. My only issue was with the price, which I thought was high for using an old part that was going to be recycled in the repair. I would use Monkey Wrench for their expertise in tankless water heaters but I would not use them for general maintenance because I don’t think I can afford them for most things.< /Text>

During a bathroom remodel my tankless water heater went out and I called a few places for a quote. Monkey Wrench Plumbing was very responsive and was able to schedule a visit for an estimate right away. They called to confirm the appointment and even let me know when the plumber was on his way! That was great.

When Josh arrived he took a look at my current tankless and have me a few options and suggestions. The different quotes were promptly sent to my email for me and my family to review.

Although I went with a different company I will say that MWP was very professional, courteous and prompt. Definitely a breath of fresh air from my other plumbing experiences.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Josh and Isidro are true professionals. We needed hot water because my tankless water heater kept breaking down. Josh came out, assessed the situation, and gave me many options as to how I could fix the problem. I completely switched out my system with a brand new one. During the time they worked, they were very patient with my curious 5 year old son and answered all his questions. I was given a run down of how everything was set up and how everything works. These guys are not only friendly, but extremely knowledgeable and thorough.  I’m completely satisfied with the quality of their work and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this company. I WISH I USED MONKEY WRENCH PLUMBING A LONG TIME AGO!< /Text>< Pictures>

These guys are great - all of them.  We had Ruben first, a year ago he replaced our tankless water heater and some other stuff and did a great job.  We were most satisfied.  Today we had Max for our one year service appointment and he was great, really knowledgeable, very helpful and just really enjoyable.  Then we had a Joshua for our other tankless water heater.  Today we had Rick Aguirre for installation of a soft water system.  It was a big job and he did a great job.  He went over and above.  Some lines had a way to go and he trenches them.  He was personable, professional and he obviously knew what he was doing.<//review>

<text>No Monkey Business with Monkey Wrench!!!!
I needed help with the "last mile" of my Tankless
Lauren took my call and routed my request to Joey in dispatch.
I was given a window of time and a phone call to say technician Josh is on his way.
In less time than it took for my wife to say "John when are we going to hot water again" Josh had diagnosed my Tankless issue and resolved the problem. Me 15 years as an union electrician, another 15 years as a field superintendent for large commercial general contractor and finally my last stop hopefully, a facilities manager at a University. Lets just say I have been around, working on, installing systems most of my adult life. Monkey Wrench will now be a part of my proverbial tool box.< /text>< Pictures>

Do NOT purchase the fruit bowl or any food for that matter at this location. I purchased their fruit bowl as a late night snack and after taking a few bites realized there was mold on it. I just threw it away and sent an e mail to the Wendy's location notifying them that night. The next day I went to work and felt extremely sick where I had stomach cramps and had to leave work early. Later that day I called corporate to complain and was told I would be contacted by the manager. A week later and I've heard nothing! I will probably look into notifying one of the news channels at this point so no one eats there again</text>

<text>What when it comes to customer service I am very very displeased with the situation I ordered $15 worth of food didn't get what I asked for with the condiments I mean it makes the meal not only that I didn't get a beverage for the fact that I was ordering descending Baconator but didn't give me the combo so they charge me an arm and a leg just for the hamburger call them back spoke to the manager and you would think the manager would provide great customer service right negative didn't caught me didn't ask me to come back to pick up what they have forgotten my condiments it was within the first three minutes I called him so I still have my food very frustrated Wendy's was great to me but that location here is a negative double check your meals<//text>< Pictures>

I don’t like this Wendy’s.  The last couple of times I’ve gone there, the food was cold and had been sitting under lights and not hot, I could immediately tell. It was really cold outside and late in the day so I didn’t want to drive back.  Also they put the sauces right by a window during the day that the sun beats down on, it makes them warm.  It’s disgusting.  One time I found a hair in my food there.  When I went back to complain I saw one of the cooks putting a sandwich together with her hair all loose and hanging in the front.  With a loose sagging fold in the ponytail. And last time I ate there the buns were dry and aged and not soft at all.  The chicken In that sandwich was lukewarm and too crunchy and also dry.  Everyone’s fries were cold.  The two burgers were barely warm too.  And they forgot a soda.<//text>

Even if its midnight and there's no one else there. Why the rush? I  got five kids screaming orders all at once.  give me a second.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>really bad experience. came into the front lobby and saw all the staff sitting in the dining room, then by the time i made it to the front counter they still didn't make it back to take my order. my food was rushed and thrown on the tray just so they could finish with me before i paid. i sat down and fries were over salted and luke warm, the nuggets were hard and the frosty was almost melted. feels like everything had been sitting there and i didn't want to deal with the workers. will not return to this location.< /text><rating>1</rating><Time>1473231025152</Time></record>

Terrible experience. Got baconator fries and 2 son of baconators. Fries were old and dried out, bacon tasted gross and texture felt weird. Bacon on the burger was way too rubbery and the buns were falling apart. Girl that took out order was rude and mad dogged us. Do not recommend. Just go to the one on Valley View.<//Text>

3 out of 3 times they forget to give you ketchup and/or sauce.  They don't even bother to ask you and it is up to you the customer to remember how to do their job.  Gave them 3 chances and I will never step foot in this Wendy's again.</Text>

<rating>3</rating><review>I use to work for Wendy's and so I know the standards they have. And this location is always under performing. Theyre slow and the product is never fresh. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and I asked for it to bed freah cause the last time it was ridiculously old. The guy at the register, Brandon was nice about it. He asked the lady for a fresh one..and she had attitude...then tried to give me one that was "2 or 3 mins old" I opened it and the chicken was cold. I laughed and was like "ill wait the i mins for a fresh one." I also ordered a couple chilis and they didnt have chili seasoning.  I asked for a refund for my chili cause I only like it with the seasoning. And all of a sudden they found some. I don't know why they can't get it together. I still work in the restaurant industry and its never okay to be out of something or not give the best product you can from open to close. Dave Thomas has square patties for a reason...cause he doesnt cut corners...< /review>< Pictures>

I thank my brothers Nikedimos and Werede for directing me to National Truck and Bus School in Hayward. I was preparing myself to go to Fresno based on other recommendations. After my first day of discussing about the training with Toki(staff at the school) I decided to start by depositing half of the amount. The instructors Lucky and Toki are professional and friendly.They were there to help when ever I requested. On road trip the champion was Uncle(staff).Uncle went above and beyond to help me master the road trip. He gave me the best tips which helped me pass at my first DMV test.considering it’s cheap training cost the package they provide is huge.But be mindful to ask at all times for best result. Thank you Lucky, Toki and Uncle for helping me succeed.<//Review>

I’m planned on doing trucking soon, and looked over my options. Among all the places that they could teach you, this one is the one of the better ones if not the best one to go to. The instructors are kind and are more then willing to help me out when I do practice with them. They made me feel comfortable in their presence, and I think driving a truck along side them would be much easier then doing it somewhere else.</Review>

Great school. You can get a good learning experience for a affordable price. Lucky, toki, uncle and JB work as a team to manage students and make sure no one is missing out. They have a extensive knowledge of the maneuver they teach. Thank you national for helping me get my Class A.</Text>

My experience at National Truck and Bus driving school was great. The students all bond with each other and assist one another whenever they can. A lot of positive energy is spread even when the stress of trying to obtain certifications that can financially jump start your life is weighing on you. Nothing is  guaranteed. As for as the instructor's, they are all helpful and will assist you with whatever is a concern. Toki is the pre-trip/driving instructor and will be to main force getting you over the hurdle of the pre-trip segment of your test. Lucky is the main instructor and he helps with skills and driving. Lucky is great at reassuring you that everythings going to be okay. JB is the main stick shift driving instructor, great instructor. JB is very patient and understanding and I truely appreciate him working with me. Uncle/Mr.P is Automatic and skill test instructor, great instructor. Uncle and I would take off in the automatic and bend corners. We'd head out to Fremont and tell me what I will have to deal with on test day. He was also very reassuring, 'great driver's','smart driver' and 'No worries'. He helped me more than he had to. I'd recommend this school for those looking to get their CDL.</text>

<review>I highly recommend National Truck driving school. From day 1 they let me know that everyone is family and we all work with each other to reach goals. It wasnt just words, it was true.

What I liked most about the school was there planning. How they put you in position to past the test by teaching the students step by step  each skill need to succeed on test day.

Trucking is not for everyone, but if you wanna be trucker i highly recommend this school. Like any field thats worth obtaining, be prepared to work, they give you the tools neccessary and the rest is up to you.

Personally I'd like to thank toki for teaching me the pre trip staight back. Thanks to his honesty in telling me i needed to strengthen some of my skills, that i stepped back to strengthen thise skills, which were vital to my advancement

I like to thank Lucky who help me with the offset and parallel parking. Not only did he teach me how to perfect those skills, but i watched him perform the skill flawlessly and it gave me hope on days that i felt i couldn't get the skills right. It encouraged me to just need to keep practicing one day I'll have skills like his. Biggest Shout out yo lucky was HIS ROAD teaching was the the final peice to the puzzle. Good energy and instruction can take you a long way.

Lastly  i wanna thank unkle. Man of few words but genuinely wants to see you succeed and will back you up with positive energy and experience about trucking.

Thank you National truck driving school. Keep up the good work of graduating driving prospects.💪🏿🙌🏿🙏🏿👍🏿</review>< pics>

GREAT PLACE A CLASS  GREAT PLACE A CLASS
Great place to train for your CDL. I took the 14 day course and passed my test on the first try.  Be motivated and eager to learn what you need to pass the test. Cooperate, listen, and learn from not only the staff but other students that have been in the program a little longer than you. Great place for beginners and the experienced.

Good luck to you!<//Review>

It was a great wonderful and helpful Truck driving school! I was able to get my class B license in one week. Lucky was a great instructor, he made sure that I was Comfortable made sure That I understood the airbrake test, the walk around test, in the in cab Inspection. They always help you in every moment answer Every question you ask with proper knowledge. Everyone at national driving school was professional, kind, helpful, and made me feel welcome, they prepare you very well and let you know When you’re ready for the driving test they just don’t send you without being well prepared. So if you’re looking to get your class B or your clase go to national driving school and Get well prepared for your Commercial driving  license. Thx National driving school!< /Review>

<review>I had a great time here with many good people that now became good friends. I also want to give a special thanks to Lucky for helping me get through this even after the pandemic hit. Yesterday I finally passed my road/skills test all thanks to Lucky and his staff for helping me get through it and being extremely patient with me. Highly recommend this school for anyone wanting to obtain their CDL A or B.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< userid>

Got my class B with endorsements in about 3 weeks ! Lucky was my teacher and gave me all the info and skills training I needed to pass on my first test.The study materials I was given were exactly what I needed.If you come motivated and confident you will succeed at this school.This school is also a fraction of the price of other schools.I would come here again if I needed too.< /Review>

< Review>
My experience with the National Truck and Bus Driving School was a very good experience. When I first started, I was nervous because I have never drove manual before and there was a lot to learn but everyone from the school helped me with everything I needed help with. I learned everything very quick and my driving is so  much better now because of this school. Before I took my DMV test, I was extremely nervous but I applied all of my skills I learned from the school and passed my test. I am officially a Class-A truck driver and I gave all thanks to this school!!!! Thank you to Toki, Lucky, JB, and Uncle for all of your help!<//Review>

<text>These guys will get you through your driving test. Learning is reinforced with small group peer-to-peer activities. This is an outdoor hands on program. The instructors, like Uncle and Lucky, know the ins and outs of local DMV offices and will give you key tips on passing.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

I chose this school because it had good reviews. After attending and getting my CDL, I can see why. Knowledgeable, experienced staff. They will prepare you for your test. As with anything, you get out of it what you put in. Dedication is key. Now I have my CDL and started a new job and instructor Lucky help me and hook me up within a week of graduating. Thanks to all staff Lucky, Toki, Uncle and Mr Jb . ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//Review>

National truck driving school is a great course to take for those looking into CDL class A or B. Lucky and Toki are great instructors, very patient and actually take the time to teach you what is needed to be a CDL pro. They'll work with you and are very helpful to fully understand the purpose of driving a commerical vehicle. I recommend National truck driving school for those who are serious in obtaining a CDL.<//Review>

<Text>National Truck Driving School is an excellent school. They help you achieve your CDL in the most professional and timely manner. Lucky the instructor is awesome and makes sure all your learning needs are met. This truck school is an ideal place to learn individually and in groups. Santokh the new instructor is very helpful and teaches very well. You will get one on one attention with the instructors which help a lot. This truck school also helps with job placement. Overall, my experience at this truck was wonderful. There’s no better way I could’ve acquired my commercial drivers license.</Text></record>

National truck school is one of the best and genuine school in the Bay Area. I had great learning experience at this school. The owner Kevin and instructor Lucky are very supportive and encouraging. They helped Me to get mine Class A license in short time. They also helped me find an employment. The entire team at National school put a lot of efforts for their students. They treat you like your own family. If you are looking for an genuine driving school please join National truck driving school. #sirabande 🙏🏻</Review>

Bay Area No.1 school for Class A, B.
Need License for Truck & Bus ? Stongly recomend Come & try it here.

The Instructor Lucky pajee & Toki are the greatest people, always smiling & Good Manner always helpfull & the Uncle G who will take u to DMV for Test is the great person i have seen will make u feel good and give u extra energy and tips to pass it.
The Only school in Bay Area which has  6 Trucks for students Practice which u won’t find in any other school, 1 only for Air Break Always, 1 for walk Around inspection only, 1 for straight Back and Off set, 1 only for Parallel Parking & Two For the Road Trip one is Automatic and one is Manuall if u like To take any it’s up to u.
Feel free to change ur timing if u want & Do as much practice as u want for the Air Break & walk around there’s is no timing u can always come and can study as long as u want.
U will learn very quick as they go step by step they will make u start with walk around inspection, straight back & Air Break, later on second week u will start to learn Off set  with Road trip u will continue with Parallel and will be perfectly ready for the test by end of four weeks.< /review>

When I needed my class B license I started doing my research on schools around bay area.  After doing my research I found National Truck & Bus school and spoke to Lucky on the phone.  He was very professional and provided me with a estimate time of when I can obtain my license after starting classes.  He is one of the most professional instructors out there for commercial license around Bay area.  Also, the price for the classes was the most reasonable compared with competitors.  I was lucky to find Lucky and would 100% recommend him to others.< /review>

<text>Hi everyone.. so I decided to get a cdl after working in retail for many years. I went to different schools to checkout but I liked National trucking and bus school the best because of couple reasons.. firstly they had the 10 speed transmission whereas most other schools only have 6 speed trucks only.. not only that after talking to instructors Lucky, Santokh and uncle I found out they were pretty knowledgeable and cool. They helped me a lot and were very patient throughout.. As my cdl road test was coming near the school got a new automatic truck and they were considerate enough to let me change me to automatic, since I wasn't too sure about the manual transmission..that make it almost 100 percent sure that I was going to be successful on my first attempt and thank God thats what happened. Thankyou everyone at the school (all instructors as well as students too).< /text><Time>1619828173685<//Time>< resp>

Thank you LUCKY and SHARIFF for my class A license. At first I was pessimistic because it was a little bit disorganized but somehow it works . You will probably learn 70-80% from school and the rest from YouTube and students . If you expect to study in a classroom and study driving with your own truck , then you should go pay a $4000 driving school because this place is not it ..but I can promise you that the school can and will get you a class A license ..Thanks again Lucky and SHARIFF , JB and Uncle< /Text>

Shout out to Lucky, Toki and JB for getting me through this journey and training me for my Class A License. You want your Class A or Class B then go apply at National truck school. The down payment is worth it and cheaper then any other truck school. They won’t let you down but most importantly it’s up to you on how bad you want your License. Thank you Lucky, Toki and JB.< /review>

I have had great experience in learning combination truck driving. They are low cost and high quality school. There is also bus drivers school available here. Lucky and Sheriff are professional teachers. JB is professional and very friendly instructor.  I recommend this place for future class A truck drivers.<//text>

<text>If you looking for a school to get your CDL this is the best  lucky is the man I juist graduated from this school and in my opinion they have really helped me,  All the trainers treated everyone like a family. I know there are many schools around but if you pick this school you are going to make a good choice they have good prices and give you a lot of hours of training and if i ever had to do this again i will come back to them they also have alot of schedules to choose from. I 100% reccomend, and i just want to thanks  lucky
And all the stuff for their help

My experience was very up and down because of Covid! My DMV test was postponed twice because of Covid, was at the school for almost 6 months and still National Truck School was very understanding. Lucky is a great instructor, cares for the school like it was his. I personally had a great experience and I would reference this school to anybody. I wanted to mention that one of the trucks broke down a couple of days before my appointment at DMV and was looking to postpone my appointment once again but I was lucky I had Lucky by my side and he was able to get the mechanic to fix the truck and have it ready for me right on time. That’s the great value you get. Thank you once again.< /Review>

Firstly, I would like to thank my instructors at National Truck Driving School. Lucky, Sharif, Mr. JB and Brar are personal, down to earth instructors. After only six weeks of schooling and study, I passed my walk around and road test first time. If you are looking for a school that is reasonable with personable instructors, go to National trucking school in Hayward California.</Review>

I got enrolled after attending a couple of free classes. My instructor Lucky Bhaji asked me to get enrolled only after I liked their training. I salute his confidence in his training techniques. I would highly recommend the National Driving School to all those seeking training to drive a truck, bus etc.
I appreciate the instructors Lucky Bhaji, Sharif Bhai, Santokh Brar for training me. They made sure I had enough training before they helped me with my DMV appointment. Lucky Bhaji went out of the way to get me trained, also Mr. Brar ensured that I got enough hours on the road. JB sir was always very helpful and quite cool I must say.
A big shout out to National Driving School, they not only trained me enough to get my Class A  license but are also helping the students with jobs. What more can one ask for.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

The staff is excellent and made learning to drive easy. enrollment is fast and no hassle. They have flexible payment plans and will work with you to get you in. overall its a great school and if you're interested in learning how to drive trucks or buses in a short period of time this is the place to do it. thank you Lucky, Gee, Ray and all the staff at the school I deeply appreciate all of your help.</Review>< Pics>

I had a really great experience learning how to drive a truck with Lucky and his staff. Lucky really takes a personal role in making sure that their students learn the necessary skills and are well prepared to take their exams. Would definitely recommend National truck driving school for anyone interested in getting their CDL. The best school in Hayward.<//Text>

Not enough words to express how grateful I am for the guys at National Truck and Bus Driving School. I passed my test on the first try today with the tremendous help I’ve received from my instructors. I would recommend anyone of any diversity to attend if interested in becoming a driver. I would give 100 stars if I could!< /Review>

When I was ready, they gave me plenty road time, I was able to accomplish this in just 3 months going to National Truck Driving School and also working a full time job. They make you feel like family and they really care about your accomplishments. If you are looking to become a truck or bus driver, this is the place. Thanks again Lucky, JB and Sharif and Piara uncle  for all your help.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Best school with best instructors. I got my class A license within less than a two month. Special thanks to lucky sir and sherif sir. They helped me a lot. Being under their supervision is worthy. They know best and easiest tactics how a student can drive a truck In better way. I got hundred percent satisfaction. I  recommend this school to all who are looking forward to have a truck/bus driving license. They have been in this profession from long time.</Text>

I would like to thank Sharif , Lucky and Mr. JB and especially Uncle. I have spent the past three months at the school working on my class A license and on October 1 I passed my test . I must admit at first I was afraid ,I was petrified to go on my test but Lucky and sharif were very helpful and they would not just sent me out to the road test and fail. On the day of my test Lucky and the man ,all of us students called Uncle in the school yard ,They met me at school, specially  early and helped me get the truck ready for the test .On the drive down to the center  Lucky was  coaching  me like a big brother ,giving last minute advise and encouragement all  the way down on the drive . I felt like I could not fail . Thank you Lucky .and  to the other students that I have met that are still in school I wish you all the best and good luck  to all .</Text>

I graduated today from this school and I can’t remember a better feeling than I have right now. I had a situation that had me out of school for a month. Lucky and Sheriff embraced me and helped me with everything going. Great instructors. They didn’t just teach me how to operate the vehicle...They helped me understand how to make what I wanted. I just want give a special thanks to Lucky who can manage things in a very professional way.
Best of luck guys!

<Text>My husband when here to learn how to drive a 10 speed manual transmission truck. After he completed all the training he took his DMV test and now has his Class A commercial Truck driving license.
The staff was super helpful and friendly and provided him with all the necessary training needed to pass the California DMV test.
National truck driving & bus driving school has a large outside area/yard where they teach you everything you need to know to pass the skills test.
Once you master the skills test then you will have on the road training. You also learn the walk around & the airbrake test.
They have 2 truck for the road practice & DMV. They also book your DMV appointment when you are ready.
They are reasonably priced for the area.<//Text></record>

<text>I got a lot out of this school. The price of tuition attracted me at first, and I'm glad that I enrolled with National. Sharif, Lucky, and J.B. all helped me significantly in my training for a California Class A CDl. I just passed yesterday, on my first attempt with the DMV. The curriculum involves a lot of studying and memorization in addition to developing the necessary driving skills.

Although I've been a licensed Class C driver for 13 years, I needed to learn the differences with Class A driving which aren't so obvious. I was glad to move through the process quickly, dedicating a portion of my week to studying and practice. Sharif and Lucky helped me perfect the essential parking maneuvers, and J.B. was instrumental in getting me comfortable with driving on city streets and on the highway. I was nervous during my test, but I felt well prepared with a solid foundation in knowledge and practice. I was glad to be studying during the recent DMV closure, and the school was very proactive in securing my test date and ensuring that I was well prepared and confident despite my nerves.

This is a busy school, and the price is unbeatable. I've enjoyed learning with and from fellow students, as I feel that the best way to prove one's knowledge of a subject is to be able to teach it. We learn by doing, and I was pleasantly surprised to be thrown into practical learning on my first day of attendance. Although I wasn't completely sure of myself in the new environment, I was encouraged by the staff's confidence in me, as well as their openness to working around my preferences. I found Sharif, Lucky, and J.B. to be empathetic and patient, and I trusted them to get me up to speed and on my way. I'm glad I did!</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Best school , Best Instructors at a very reasonable price . I got my class B Bus license from this school .I paid $1700. I passed my cdl test in first try . They have a very good reputation in Fremont dmv . I noticed that National driving school instructors are more talented than dmv examiners and they are very knowledgeable . I am already getting job offers from Waste management and united rentals . Thanks to all national staff. I really appreciated the staff cutting their lunch break short to come out and help us. Very efficient and and professional instructors. A big shout out to my instructor LUCKY. Awesome dude.
Thank you<//Review>

Shout out to Lucky for making it happen in less than 2 weeks. Lucky is a great instructor and helped me to get my class B license in less than 2 weeks. He is very responsible and cares about his students. I highly recommend to go with Lucky. While I was there, 6 students passed their test in their first shot. Contact him if you want to get your class B at a low price.</Text>

I highly recommend this school. The instructor, Mr. Lucky was really professional and helped me prepare for my commercial B license and because of his excellent training and dedication I was able to pass on my first attempt. This school is one of the best in the Bay Area and I definitely recommend anyone looking for training lessons to check out this place. You won't be disappointed!!!< /Review>

Hi to all, If your looking for a truck driving school to obtain the class A license the national truck and bus driving school is a great option. In about  two months I got my license. All their helpful tips made it so easy to remember the information.<//text>

Not very professional, all their concerned about is money. I paid $1700.00 in cash and after failing my second test the school wanted to charge me another 600.00 and I could only come back to school 2 days before the next exam. I failed the third test due to the truck not working properly, in fact several students failed the same manuever I did with the truck. Road time is only 15 minutes per week if you're lucky. One of the instructors Sharif raised his voice. Almost yelling at me because I did not get a manuever right the second time I drove. Always long wait time to practice on trucks. There is no organization, students do what they want.  I learned more from other students than I did the insructors, Lucky and Sharif. I saw alot of partiality there as some students are favored more than others. I would not recommend this school to anyone serious about getting a commercial license. You get what you pay for at National.</Text>

<Text>I highly recommend National. This school offers the best value for your money in the Bay Area. The trainers are knowledgeable, friendly, & very helpful. If you want to begin your career as a commercial driver, let the professionals at National teach you what you need to know.  The success rate of their students speaks volumes about the quality training they provide. 5 stars, of course!</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

There is only two things that I don’t like about the school one is it’s a dirt yard and every day I get out of there dirty and the other thing is they need to replace some of the trucks. Three or four of the trucks seen better days. In my opinion the best instructor would be lucky I like the way he teaches. He’s not I afraid to tell you what you did wrong and what you missed and that’s the best way to learn so pick this school.  Go there and ask for Lucky you will pass your test</text>< Pictures>

I came to this school with no experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, patience and they explained the skills of truck driving perfectly. In 2 months I felt fully confident to take my driving test for my class A license. I passed my test on the first try and the dmv instructor said I was very good. I told him I was taught by very good instructors. I would put this school up against any school any day. Thank you Sharief, Lucky and Mr. J.B. For helping me in my new career.</Text>

<Text>I Graduated yesterday and it was amazing. Not only did I graduate but I scored a 97.  The training you get here at National Truck Driving School is by far the best, between Lucky, Sharrif and Mr Jb they had me ready in no time !!! If you are looking for a GREAT school look no further because this is where you want to be. Since I’ve been in school I have watched nothing but drivers succeed and graduate do to the attention and detail of all the instructors.  I’m very glad I chose National because it has changed my

National Truck n Bus driving school has some of the best instructors there is Lucky is very caring about teaching and getting the information u need even makes appointments for you at the DMV  and can get one at the last minute. Some times he wears to many hats and not able to give you the quality time u need but he will make up for it. Like everything needs improvement like their bus but Lucky was able to work it until the last day of use and l graduate on that day. Thank you Lucky</Text>

I definitely recommend National Tracking and Bus driving school to anyone who are looking for affordable price and great service.
I had probably the best instructors (Mr Shiref, Mr Lucky, and one of the greatest man Mr JB) they were very patient and explained every parts very clearly even if some students have lack of English understanding.

It was a pleasure to work with other instructors at the times they all had same qualities every one of them greet you with a smile and are very positive, they wants you to succeed.

National Tracking and Bus driving school is the best investment you can make and thank you for putting a seal on my confidence. In addition to that all these three instructors work together as a team. Team work makes the dream work! I am great full of there hard work for the students who are looking to succeed.

Best of luck to those who wants to join in this wonderful and amazing School.< /Text>

<Text>Hello everyone who is on their pathway into the truck driving industry. This place is the one that i suggest everyone in bay area. Why? At 1st. You are going to be taught from two perspectives. One, basics enough to pass the exam and two, broader understanding of massive machinery you have  under your control. But at 2nd, which is most of all of the above important, you have a chance of tutoring new students at later stages of your study. That makes You one level higher in getting proffesional.< /Text><userid>110377484585217581127</userid></record>

Excellent school, the instructors are well versed in all aspects of commercial driving. By the time I went for my test I was hundred percent sure I was going to pass. And most importantly you can beat the price for a commercial driving license school. Thank you very much to all the staff. And I did pass!!!< /review>

So happy I came to National!  Just passed my Class A test on the first shot! These guys, Lucky and Sharif (JB too!) are a class act.  They are patient, detail-oriented, inclusive of all levels, and welcoming to all walks of life.  If you are driven to get your commercial license, they will get you there!</review>

<Review>Lucky and Sharif were very helpful in helping me to get through with my truck driving lesson. 3 month period finishing this program was somewhat frustrating especially when you do not have any idea what you are trying to learn but with their patience and good guidance I made it. It was nice having these two as my instructor. They were great. I just got my license yesterday!! Special thanks to Lucky you are the best!!< /Review>< Pictures>

When I first joined National trucking school, I had no knowledge of operating or driving a semi truck.  I literally had to start from scratch. With the help of the instructors,I  learned how to drive properly, safely and efficiently. I owe a debt of gratitude to those who helped me pass my Class A drivers license. The price to join the school is unbeatable and I highly recommend NDS.<//Text>

First I would like to thanks the instructors Sherif and Lucky and GB for helping me with my class. the best school ever. If you have questions they will answer it for you. And if you needed help on your weaknesses they will help you. The price for the class is reasonable. I would recommend anybody to the school I just got my CDL last week.<//Text>

< Review>
Today I had my dmv driving test but two days before my appointment I told Lucky and Sheriff  to extend my appointment because I wasn't feeling prepare to do the driving test yet, but Lucky and Sheriff  told me that it's not necessary because I'm prepared lucky even told me that he would take me to the road and he did he also took me to a long road test yesterday. The way they talk to me and supported make me had more confidence  and if not because they insisted a lot at this point I wouldn't be so happy because I went to my DMV appointment today and I passed all my tests and now I have my commercial driver license. I definitely highly recommend anybody and also my friends that if they want to start a CDL career there's no other best place than National Driving School
Thank you Lucky and Sheriff< /Review>

< Review>
Lucky, Sharif and JB all 3 instructors  they are really professional, every time i had any question they where always their and show me the right way to drive or learn anything about the truck. They let you teach other students many people sees it bad, but i see it in the way that while im teaching someone im also practicing and learning, So its really beneficial to them and to me. But the school its great any school you go to trust me you will learn the same techniques because dmv requires it. Plus they also have the best price in the bay you wont find none better then NATIONAL DRIVING SCHOOL. Thank you so much guys.  Class A driver now 🤟🏻</Review>

But what makes this school stand out the most is the fact that they are very flexible with their schedule and the instructors provide outstanding services. These instructors most definitely ensures that you will pass your licensure exam.

Guaranteed that the instructors, (All instructors’ Sir lucky,shareef, Jb); will help you out especially enhancing your weak points by providing more time with you to make sure you overcome these weaknesses.

Overall the vibe within this school is exceptional, the students are all willing to learn as well as the instructors are always ready to teach and share you all the knowledge you need to know.</Review>< Pictures>

Today I got my License class A I would like to share my experience. This is the best School. All of them has the best knowledge, they are very patient with the students they love to teach.The environment of the school is like a family and  to be honest when I was searching for the truck driving school alot of schools was trying to charge me more money than normal by telling me that I am a woman and I gonna take more time to learn .But somehow I found NATIONAL TRUCK AND BUS DRIVING SCHOOL and  I found here they treat everybody equal and give confidence to all students that they can do this no matter what age what gender you are last but not the least the prices are affordable so I recommend to all the people and especially to women's who are searching for truck driving school this is the place where you have to go NATIONAL TRUCK AND BUS DRIVING SCHOOL  and you will gonna get all the help you need. Once again thank you all for all your help.

School is good, they have big yard so students have lot of space to practice their skills.
Instructors are very nice specially LUCKY he knows what a student needs and he is always very helpful.
Only problem or I must say big problem is with the TRUCKS that they have. All of them are very old and in poor condition.
I am giving 5 stars for instructors only because of them I was able to pass my test.

Thanks a lot LUCKY bro👍👍👍<//review>

This is not the right one

Thank-You National Truck Driving School for having me as a student.
As I have learn through your patience and understanding for me to pass my class A license test the FIRST TIME.  As mentioned in the above articles, as I too researched the market for a place that was convenient to me as well as being reasonably priced.  This particular school has an extremely large lot to practice your driving skills, which makes a big difference.  I was able to get hands-on behind the wheel training almost daily.  The biggest problem I had was shifting the gears.  Truck gears are completely different as you need to double clutch each time and watch your RPM constantly.  I want to specially give special thanks and  “hats off”  to Lucky and Sharif for teaching me on how to drive and pass my test the first time around.  They indeed are great instructors.

In three months, attending few hours a day, we both finished our training and passed the test with DMV; licenses should arrive in the mail in two weeks :)

Instructors - Sharif, Lucky, and JB are very professional and have good experience and knowledge with truck and bus driving. Great personality and the learning environment is very friendly. Thanks for everything!

Student helping student is the norm in the dusty courtyard everyday...

Tuition for this school is very reasonable. We are planning to continue our education in getting our Class B bus license here...

Come checkout the school and talk to the instructors :)< /text>< Pics>

<Review>My experience with the school was very pleasant. Got my license in under 2 months. Bring the right attitude and willingness to learn and you'll be met with excellent guidance
Lucky is probably the best CDL instructor! Working 1 on 1 with him even for a few hours will shave weeks off your learning curve

The school is open 7 days a week, spacious yard for practice, technically sound instructors readily available for guidance, help with job placement. Would definitely recommend National Driving School!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This school offers the best quality training with the lowest prices.
Dedication and knowledge of Mr. Sharif and Mr. Lucky entitled this school to a golden standard school of driving.
I fully recommend this school for CDL seekers< /Review>

<Review>I just pass the road test!!
Since I did not have much time to attend school
I was worry about length of class but I had to start ..
When I Visited the school office  I was convinced it can be done quicker and I actually
Finished in 3weeks.

Thank you for “Lucky” he was very helpful
Teacher Most importantly, He could adjust
His time and professional knowledges to each
Different student to pass the exam as quickly
As possible.

Thank you,

<Review>I passed my class B testing today and I would have not done it, if it wasn't for Lucky, Sharif JB and Uncles knowledge, guidance,help and patience. I came to National Driving Trucking school with zero knowledge of trucks, but they took their time to teach me everything. I also didnt know how to drive manual, but thanks to them now, I do. It took me 2 months. Ladies, dont feel intimate by driving big trucks or trailers with their help you'll be an expert on road. It is also a Female friendly school. I really liked how we would help each other amongst students. We all help each other to succeed in the areas were we needed more practice. Thank you so much!!!!!</Review>< userid>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>Where to start..the staff at National trucking and Bass Driving school are the best. I felt incredibly insecure starting my journey  as a truck driver considering I have never driven a vehicle with a clutch...but the Instructors there (Sharif, Lucky and Mr JB) made  Me feel very comfortable  and always encouraged me even when I doubted myself they kept encouraging me that I could do it. Long story short  they helped me through all my
obstacles  with out losing their cool they are so patient with the students there I will miss all my Instructors  it's a bitter sweet moment  when I passed my class A driving test on my first try. I couldn't have done it with out them I highly recommend  this school 🙌🙌

I came in to the school not knowing what to expect and spoke with Sharif and Lucky He was very helpful and knowledgeable. He gave me all the information that I needed to get my license.

Fast forward to my first week in the class, I was getting really frustrated With the skills training and maneuvering the truck. Sharif Noticed I was getting discouraged and made sure I had as much time as I needed to get my confidence back.

I graduated today 10/142019 with flying colors and I’m very happy and pleased that I came to this school. If you’re looking to become a Class A Truck Driver National Trucking and Bass school is the  best place to go. I would like to thank Mr Sharif, Lucky, JB and the entire staff for their guidance and expertise.

Highly recommend ...as I attended school and had great experience of professional environment which helped me to obtain my license in just three days and especially Instructors are very helpful who train you very professionally and try to make sure that during your preparation you should be fully prepared to obtain your commercial driving test with proficient knowledge and skills both.I must admire both  instructors Mr.lucky who trained me very thoroughly is great instructor and empathetic person  and also Mr sharif who helped with pre trip preparation is a very good instructor and as well as a good person.

<Review>Lucky, Shareef and JB hands down best instructors in the bay. I checked out other schools but National had the best prices, yard, trucks, and instructors who are always willing to help. Everyone gets along with each other and they treat you like family. All of my classmates passed on the first attempt including myself because they break everything down in easy terms to understand. I'd definitely recommend National Truck and Bus driving school for anyone looking to obtain a commercial DL.< /Review>< gmapID>

I passed my DMV test the first try 7/3/19  and got my CDL. This school was great for me. Lucky, Sharif and JB were great and very patient instructors. Don't judge this school by the older vehicles they have. Just like in life, you get what you put into it. The lower cost of training for this school made it affordable for me to sign up and start a new career. I now have a job as a commercial driver. Thank you Lucky, Sharif and JB.</Text>

I would like to share my experiences from National Truck and Bus Driving School
I found this school the best for me they have very affordable price and good instructors
I offer this school for all who are looking to upgrade their driving license. I would like to give them moor stars but actually here I found just five stars.
The instructors specially Mr Lucky and Mr Shareef are very friendly and explain all parts of the vehicle professionally. Once again special thanks to Mr Luchy and Mr Shareef
Hope you all the best< /Review>

My husband Alejandro Rigby just completed his Class A course. He is happy with the support that this company provided. They are professional and everyone gave their all. He could not have done it without the determination of all involved. Thanks a lot for making his dream of becoming a Class A driver come true.<//review>

Worst trucking School in the bay area. Pure scam the manager Abdul doesn't care about you he only cares about your money. The owner Kevin is even worse. I went there for two days and left because they have too many people with only one guy teaching. Trucks are really old and all you do when you get to class is to practice in an old junk they have. After being there for two days I went to the manager Abdul to get my money back and he told I had to pay a cancellation fee of $350 plus he told me that needed to write a letter to the owner Kevin and he would give me my reimbursement. After a day I wrote the letter and sent an email to them with no answer. I managed to get the owners "Kevin" phone number and when I tried to explain my situation to him he shut me up by saying he is not involve in such situation that the one in charge of the reimbursement is the Manager Abdul is been a week and I haven't gotten my reimbursement. So please if you are looking for a good school don't come here because after you sign that contract is over!<//review>

They are very professional and supportive. Both Lucky and Sharif very helpful and motivated me from the first day of my training. I like the fact they timely scheduled my DMV appointments and always willing to work around your schedule if you working FT while going to school on Saturday. Definitely recommend this school and the price you pay compare to other schools according to my research..good luck!!</review>

My experience at National Truck Driving school was great because I’ve learned how to drive a manual transmission never drove stick before a day in my life. The best Accomplishment of the year for me Sharif was my trainer he was with me all the way made sure I knew my airbrakes we went over it 10 times before I went to the DMV for my test. He also give me advice about not to get so frustrated when I can’t execute a maneuver. Still got to work on that 😂  I’m now a CDL Class B with airbrakes tankers endorsement and no restrictions Thanks to the whole staff Lucky JB also helped me as well.< /Review>

I have to thank Lucky for getting me ready to get my Class B with passenger endorsement in just over 2 weeks. He was very knowledgeable with what the DMV was looking for. My DMV examiner said I was very thorough. The equipment wasn’t the best but the instructors were. I would recommend National Driving school</Review>

Amazing!Amazing!Amazing!
Got CDL B in my first shot.I became capable of getting it only with efforts of Awesum, super experienced,fully supportive only and only LUCKY bhaji.Being a female felt fully safe and secured in presence of Lucky bhaji.He deserves all the blessings and good wishes for treating women respectfully unlike other driving schools. The only negative part is OLD BUS.It stops in midst of road, transmission failures,battery problems and many more which resulted in my delayed appointment.Although i got my license through this vehicle but it made me suffer multiple times because of its old condition but the only guy encouraging me was Lucky bhaji who often asks me to practice for skills and driving on road  repetively.Only Lucky bhajj deserves this appreciation.</Text>

National Truck Driving School

I did my research on several different truck driving schools in the Bay Area. I was looking for the cheapest because my budget was low. Most schools were way beyond my budget. The schools I research wanted like up to $5,000 and more.

I contacted National Truck Driving School in Hayward California and ask them their price. When they told me I almost fell on the floor. It was within my budget and they do payment plans. I made sure I check the Bureau to see if they are legit and they are and have no discipline complains. The school is in full compliance with the law.

I went in to go over their student catalog and was amazed that all student get four months to finish the program. Other truck driving school programs out there only gives you six to eight weeks to complete.
I started my Class A training the next day and worked on it for two weeks. I boss told me I did not need a Class A and just do a Class B because we need you working now. I went back to the school and told them my situation with my job and I had no problems with them on down grading from A to B, everything was smooth.

Here I am 2 months later I just past my Class B with air brakes, thanks to their fantastic instructors, ShareeF and Lucky. They both work with Class B and Class A students but Lucky, is more focus on Class B. They both took their time to teach me how to drive and past the DMV test. This school cost is well worth it. If your funds our low and you need to get your Class A or B, this is the place.<//Text>

<review>The instructors (Lucky and Sheriff)in this school are very cooperative, helpful and supportive. They are helping students on pre trip inspections, in the yard skill driving and on the road. But the school has old trucks specially for skill training and needs to be changed. Overall National Truck driving school is a very good school, and I strongly recommend to others who are interested to get their CDL.
Thank you Lucky and Sheriff.

I just got my license today!! and what i can say about this school is that the amount of effort you put in will determine your outcome. I got my license in 5 weeks because I put in the work. The instructors are awesome but they do not micromanage you, the yard isnt the best and trucks are really old but it worked out for me. Come here giving it your all and you will succeed. I learned alot from the students that were more experienced in school as well too.
Sharrif, JV and lucky are awesome instructors and they will lead you to achieving your goal. I highly recommend this school to everyone.< /text>

Sharif and Lucky were very helpful. It took me 5 weeks to get my CDL and I probably would of got it sooner if the school wasn’t moving locations at the time. For the price and time it’s totally worth it. Thanks national for helping me out.</review>

My story with National Truck And Bus Driving School :
This school setup don't look fancy like other expensive arrogant driving schools.
Core strength of this school is their staff Lucky, Sharif, JB and Gagan.
This school fees is affordable when compared to all the other schools in the bay area.
At the age of retirement I challenged myself to get CDL, just to avoid the feeling, that I am not capable of  doing anything new at this age.
Lucky and Sharif let you tray all the skills needed and let you find out your own weakness. Then they guide you right way to correct those mistakes.
If not this school I would have dropped my attempt in the middle.
They are good in encouraging, even a weak learner like me. They (Lucky & Sharif) did not let me go down.
I made a good choice and succeeded, got my Class A license.< /Text>

<text>I feel proud to be student of NDS I’ve spend my few weeks to get the training of truck driving.
And today I’ve got my class A license and this happened  only because of the sincerity of the instructors, they work hard to make their student perfect to the skills of driving, they spend lot of time to students and help them a lot I specially thanks to Sir lucky, Sir sharif, sir JB and piyare.
I wish the best of the new year .
Thanks NDS.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Just passed my Class B test today! Sharif and Lucky are very helpful and knowledgeable. I attended school about a month and I passed my test at the first attempt. They teach how to do each test and then will test you several times to see if you’re ready to move on to the next section. Both of them took me on the road and they would tell me what I was doing right and what needed to be changed. They’re firendly, patient, and just overall great instructors. I definitely recommend this school if you’re serious about getting your CDL.</text></record></dataset><record>

I'm glad I found National to train to drive a bus. The instructors Lucky, JB and Sharif are very knowledgable and easy to work with. I was intimidated because this is a completely new occupation for me. But they know their stuff and how to prepare different kinds of people for success.< /review>

I shopped around for a long time, looking at schools l and meeting instructors around the Bay Area, nothing really compares to this school. Lucky, Shariff, And JB are three truck driving instructor’s that have so much patients and depending on how fast you learn you can have your cdl in less that 2 months no problem. I got my cdl in less than two months I saw students get they’re license in much less time than that. Whatever it is you need help learning in the matters of trucking and bus driving, all the instructors, Lucky, Shariff, and JB will spend individual time helping you and making sure you pass to get your license with patients and care. Good teachers, good price, great school please don’t waste your time with any other school, go to National Truck and Bus Driving School I promise it’s worth it 👍.</review>< pictures>

This is a great facility to prepare you for your CDL. Lucky, Sharif, and JD are wonderful instructors. The class is very interactive between students and learning the vehicles components and procedures for pre-trip inspection. The instructors are very knowledgeable and can quickly teach you how to maneuver the tractor/trailer safely and efficiently. On the road, instructors take you step by step how to operate the tractor safely and legally. If you pay attention to what they teach you here, you will have your CDL very quickly. I have never driven a commercial vehicle before starting at National Truck And Bus Driving School and I passed the test the first time and it only took me three and a half weeks! I highly recommend this school!< /Text>

Lucky our Trainor & his team are very supportive and interested in all of the SUCCESS of every student that registers....
I passed 'DMV CDL TEST' 10.26.18 receiving my Air Brakes and Passenger Endorsement!
Attending  National Truck was like extended Family truly caring about your choice of becoming a 'Commercial Driver!'

For those who want get their CDL please avoid this school. They just love to take your money and you own your own. Their trucks are really old they spend more time fixing their trucks than training the students. DMV has issues with them as well because of their trucks. The manager Abdul is rude with students and instructors.
Look around I'm sure you'll find better school.

National trucking school is where I got my training for my airbrakes endorsement I already had my class B with passenger endorsement license and I added my airbrakes I first came to national trucking school referred by a friend/coworker from Facebook.  The instructors were Lucky, Sharif, & Mr JB,  all of these guys were very well trained and very compassionate.  They would help over 10 people to get their class A and class B with airbrakes license.  I am very thankful for Lucky .  These guys work hard at what they do and they will make sure you get your license .  I recommend them 100% .don’t worry about the fees because they will help you with payment plan. They charged me $1400 for my airbrakes endorsement .  It was worth every penny .  I passed. Thank You National trucking school.<//Review>

I am pleased with my learning for  my CDL class at this school. The teachers are great ; they work hard until you get it right. I have great appreciation to my instructor ,Lucky, for his hard work and strong  customer care skills. The school has new trucks which helped my driving skills progress. The school is open 7 days which enabled me to follow my class at my convenient time. Comparing to other schools I searched ,the school has fair price. I enjoyed my experience at this school & I learned everything I need.

There trucks are in bad condition and most of the time they remain at the mechanic workshops , students do not get appropriate time for on road training and  on my appointment there Truck was not fixed and I had to rent a truck from some other person and they do not bother about any reimbursement for the loss of student's precious time. I also spoke with the owner Kevin Sandhu, that was also helpless. Management is rude and they do not care once they get the money. One more thing before signing a contract please make sure and acknowledge with manager , If their truck fails at DMV than they need to pay for wasting a students time. In other words I will say it is a scam. Be Aware of it. Do google there are other good schools in the region.</Text><user_id>104730192096713158099< /user_id><user_name>R Sekhon< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

they say garanteed but it is not.  Just a lie to take your money!

False advertising!!

if you fail your test at DMV they make you pay again! there are no classes that you can sit down and learn something! only one truck for all students.
You spend more time waiting for your turn than actually learn something! what you learn is from other students not instructors!</text>

This is the best driving school in bay area.i just got my CDL in my first go from them. They have small batches of students and I get ample time to practice in yard on truck. Also they  take me on road everytime. Instructors lucky and sharif are best tutors.

Thank you National school :-)<//text>

Hands down the downest coolest truck driving school, best investment in my life. Started July 22nd finished September 20th. I could not drive stick if my life depended on it. Instructors lucky and shariffe are the industries best men, can take any class C and turn them into a class A, easily. If you put the time to learn your craft, national truck driving school will be there to assist you, believe me when i write, best money i ever spent.</Text>

Especially Lucky makes you feel like you are his friend and not a student, and that makes the learning process so easy and fun. Thanks bro. I was ready for my CDL test in just three weeks, but I passed on my third try because on the first two tries I messed up on skills and the only reason behind that was my mirrors were not properly adjusted (my own fault, I couldn't get it straight) and I got a little nervous which is normal you know. But the instructors always remained patient with me and helped me out on every step. On my third and last chance, Lucky went over everything with me again before my test and even give me a motivational speech. So I did it, got my CDL😄<//Review><user>108710620376407523263< /user><name>Muhammad</name>< pictures>

National truck driving school moved to New location 2344 Industrial Parkway Hayward ca 94544.
We have 6 trucks and enough instructors. We give to students enough time for practice.HOUSHANG ARASTEH practice at school for one year and fail 3 times. One year is a lot to learn. He was super slow to learn. We had to charge him after 1 year practice in three times fail...please visit our school and see what can we offer you then decide....thank you... ABDUL. !</Review>

I just passed my Class B license with Passenger endorsement with the help of this school.  Let me tell you, this school wouldn't be getting a 4 from me if it wasn't for the instructors and the support I received.  Lucky is the best instructor for the Class B!  Learning from him was easy. He was always supportive and he is very knowledgeable in both class A & B!  Sharif was also very easy to learn from. They both know their stuff and they are always up to date with how DMV tests. Abdul is the Office Manager, he was able to answer my questions and get me started at the school. He was accommodating with my work schedule and when it came down to getting an appointment for me he was able to move things around!  He even helped me understand the air brakes. All of them are great people.  The only negative to this school is that the bus and trucks are very old and needs to be fixed all the time.  So students would have to wait or reschedule test appointments because of the vehicles. (I was one of those students) I give the instructors so much praise because they are still able to get their students licensed after 1 or 2 tries!  I hope you guys get a new bus soon!  Again...thanks Lucky for all that you did for me!   It took just one try for me!  If your planning on going to this school...make sure you learn from Lucky and Sharif!  They are the best!<//review>

<review>I'm giving 3 stars to the school but the instructors get 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆...especially Lucky and Shareef. They are the best, both were very helpful and they understand how to work with different students and their needs to for  them to become successful  cdl drivers and are always answering whatever questions you have.As for the school they are only about making money. Their trucks are old and barely  operational.  They have two 10 speed truck for testing and road driving but only one is available as the other one is constantly  in the garage. If it wasn't for Lucky and Shareef I wouldn't have been ready in time to pass my test. They are very accommodating and very down to earth people.  I would say they are the best especially Lucky. Thank you Lucky and Shareef...☆☆☆☆☆< /review><name>samnesh singh</name>< Resp>

My class was 6 to 8 weeks and i'd like to thank chariot for sending me to this school. The teacher that made sure i got my lisence was LUCKY. He was there every day on time and had the best attitude. He went over and over until I got it and never lost his patience wit me. Also if he was unsure about something(which was not often)he would go and find out about it and return with the correct information for the vehicle we were going to be driving at our job. LUCKY is very skilled and knowledgeable with anything to do with driving and I have my class B lisence with passenger endorsment that proves it.THANKS LUCKY YOUR THE BEST!!!!

This school is a great place to learn your pre trip inspections! I recently passed my behind the wheel exam for my Class B to become a bus driver. I aprreciate my intsructor Lucky for showing me the ropes and giving me the right tools and mindset to accomplish my goal. The vehicles are a little roughed up and old but thats what shows you that the place has experience! Above all. Great school and teachers!<//Text>

The school is great specialy they have a big Yared to practice for some skills so that is good and there are Instructors that they are so helpful but specialy for me there is great man named" Lucky " he is so kind, helpful and he knows what to do and students need to drive a bus or a truck I pass the exam because of his help and I want to say something about the school that there vehicles are very old they have one bus most of the time need a mechanic so they have to change their vehicles in general the school is good " Lucky "Thank you so much for everything<//Review>

OK where do I start with this school, I wish there was a 5+ star button cause that’s what they deserve!! They are very hands on with the teachings and make sure you get all the attention you need, they work with your schedule incase you can only come on weekends they’ll adjust and arrange special training for you. It gets no more convenient than that. I got my class A license in just 60 days with knowing nothing much about tractors & trailers, Although I must say I was very determine so that probably help but enough about me…. Ask for Lucky or Toki great guys !!< /text>
