Nigiri is authentic and is truly amazing. Fresh fish, great texture, beautiful fillets... Also, skewered chicken is delicious. I was born and raised in Japan and moved to the states 5 years ago. I had never been satisfied with sushi abroad but now I found this place! Personally, it was lucky to find my favorite Japanese red snapper as it is very hard to find authentic one. I really enjoyed foods here, and I'd definitely revisit this place.< /Review>

<Review>Made a reservation and went 30 minutes earlier and they sat us down pretty quickly. We went and ordered two sets of Omakase. The food was pretty fresh and enjoyable, they were presented very nicely and each dish was described to us. The timing of each dish was pretty well spaced out and the dinner felt very enjoyable. Overall a very good experience with great food and nice natural vibes.</Review>< Pictures>

One of the best and most reasonably priced Omakase ($65 for the cheaper option and $80 for the more expensive one). Get the supplement of wagyu, toro, uni, egg. So good. Highly recommend.</Review>

1/30/20 Edit: after their vacation, I decided to give them a real chance and try their food. Should have just left it as is...

Had the $40 deluxe sushi lunch and had one otoro and one butterfish for additional $17.

Some of the sushi definitely had a super fishy taste when at most other places, there isn’t normally any. Some of the pieces were chewy when they usually wouldn’t be (like the butterfish). The rice was hard and most of the nigiri fell apart (bad rice quality).

The otoro has really good flavor but not butchered properly, still had the fleshy part in my friend’s piece.

1/23/20
Really wanted to come try but if you close your restaurant for two random weeks not during a holiday season and don’t post about it on google maps or yelp, there’s an issue. I actually made a trip to come out and even when you show up, there’s just a tiny tiny sign that says they’re closed.

That’s a bad customer experience right there
(I showed up around 1:00 on Thursday, when they are scheduled to be open).</Review>

I got the Omakase and my boyfriend for some rolls. It was good, but I think I was expecting something a little more for the price. A lot of what I had I would not order again, but over-all it was all just ok.<//text>

<Time>1573173625250< /Time><Text>I came across Instagram to this place because of the pictures of beautiful plating. Not only the sushi is fresh and the aesthetically pleasing setting, but the price is also affordable.

Ambiance: Clean contemporary space with a nice ambiance located on the west side of the shopping center.

Ordered for 2 ppl:

Kani dou no agedashi: The kana is very umami, however, I don’t like the way that douses the crispy into the broth.

Ankimo: one of the best ankimo that I ever have, must order!

Mystery box (6 mini chirashi bowl) & 5 pieces sushi tasting: Bang for the buck! The fish is very clean and fresh. My favors are the uni and scallop.

Kani chawanmushi & uni chawanmushi: Love the softness of egg custard and the umami taste of the snow crab and uni.

Gindara kasu zuke: the grilled miso black code is so good and yummy. Love it.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Kind of a long wait despite making reservations, service could have been a little bit more attentive (but waiters were nice) and probably waited around 30 minutes for first 3 pieces of sashimi to come to our table, but when it all came, there were no disappointments on the taste and quality. Every piece was fantastic 🤤, the creamy scallop roll was super good 😍, but for three people the food wasn’t enough and ended up getting food right after. It is a nice quiet small low-key spot in the Japantown center and I probably would go again.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOd1jVuJ27VW5TFrBM9W1MIUUXPe-X9jG0pye-D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJrebu0yfEy9ma-WW3nW9bh3f-mr5S1Dv2Gp-K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Exquisite flavors. The sushi was fresh, tasty and soooo buttery. The decor is traditional, simple and elegant. My green salad had lotus root chips and a lovely light dressing. Everything about this new restaurant made me happy. We will definitely be back. If I could give more stars, I would!<//Text>

<text>Sushi itself is very very good - authentic, traditional style, two dozen or so different types of fish. I had about 15 pieces...akami, kinmedai, kohada, madai, kanpachi were all excellent. Great value.

Only issue is that service is really slow. I saw a lot of people waiting a while for their foods. We waited 40 minutes after ordering to start getting our sushi.< /text>< resp>

< Review>
One of the best Japanese restaurants I have visited in SF!!
Ordered the mystery chirashi box, which comes in 9 mini chirashi bowls, and tea braised octopus. The ingredients are super fresh and you can taste each individual unique flavor and texture. The seasoning was very creative and really goes well with the food. The yuzu wasabi and the nori rice flakes were our favourites! The tea braised octupus was really impressive and we loved how it was chewy and tender at the same time!
Other items on the menu was also intriguing, such as the omasake, starters, sushi, etc. Will definitely come back!
The ambience of the restaurant was nice, warm and cozy. Would suggest making reservation before coming. The staffs were quick and friendly, and they explain everything when serving.< /Review>

<text>Pretty bad experience due to not very professional server. No menu explaination, 2 table touch during 1:30 mins dinner.

We asked for 2 different combo meal on same table the server refuse to serve to us due to their house rule. On the menu, it said per person not per table, there is mis- lead information.

Food took very long time to come out. We have to ask for the check before the dessert hit to the table.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<time>1581057281043<//time><rating>5<//rating><review>Probably the best value sushi I've had in SF, SaSa is fantastic! There are more expensive premium sushi spots around (Omakase for instance), but for just having a normally expensive meal (about $60-$110 for the omakase menu), I think is the best. The fish was very fresh and clean, and the flavors were interesting and fun. We also got a good variety of things, from some less common (at least for SF) things like Barracuda to the mainstays of expensive sushi like Uni and O-toro.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I walked in, no one was at the front desk. I was standing there for a little while, no one is there to sit me so I walked to the one-person table in the corner, which obviously is the most appropriate spot for eating alone. A waiter walked over with this funny and arrogant facial expression on his face, asked me”how can I help u”, the tone made me very uncomfortable. I said I came here to eat so I need the menu, he literally sneered with obvious sarcasm, brought me the menu and said “you can’t just walk in and sit down, you need to wait for a waiter” , as if he was educating and judging me over a little thing that’s is their own fault(because they didn’t give me attention right away). He also had a heavy accent so I didn’t understand him at first. I would’ve apologized for sitting down by myself if he said it in a respectful way, but he was impolite so I got up and left. I can’t enjoy my food when my server is rude and looking down on me. I’ve dined in  many high-end restaurants and also cheap restaurants but I’ve never seen a waiter like this.</review>

This is a Japanese fusion place operated by non Japanese chefs.  I have dined in MANY authentic Japanese sushi restaurants with fresh fish dishes, this was not one of them. They over charge for their decor and platter presentation. Sushi is supposed to be fresh, but the omakase i ordered was made of all marinated fish pieces. Very disappointed to find such a Japanese restaurant in the heart of SF Japan town.<//Text>

Stumbled onto this place looking for sushi in Japantown mall the weekend before Halloween. What a diamond in the rough! The nigiri selection is outstanding! The quality is phenomenal with excellent cut fresh fish seasoned to perfection by the chef so you don't need to measure out your soy/Wasabi. HIGHLY recommend the kasugodai and o-Toro here as well as the bincho toro. The other pieces you see are the akami and the zuke sake toro which were fantastic as well. Can't wait to return!<//Review>

I'm so impressed by the quality of both service and taste of food. I highly recommend making a reservation or calling ahead to check on the wait time. There are certain times busier than others, but the wait is oh so worth it. The uni spoon, the mystery Chirashi bowls, the Hamachi toro.... Holy wow. So so amazing. Next time I am here I will try out the omakase. It is on the pricer end but believe me, this place is worth it for a chill dinner for one, two or even a party of 5.< /text>

It's spendy, but one of my favorites. They're not afraid to take some chances. And most pay off. Diverse sake menu.
High points include the chawamushi, agedashi tofu, wagyu tartar, chirashi (fantastic, novel presentation) and salmon five ways.
But a low were the incredible oysters let down with far too much citrus.</Text>

<Review>Came in with a friend for the lunch special- very yummy! The food was beautifully presented, and tasted great. Most memorable of the set was the katsu and kani meshi.  Their restaurant space is rather small (but spacious for diners), so reservations are probably recommended. The only thing was that service was a little spotty- it took a while for the host to get back to the front so we ended up waiting a while, and they mixed up our check (though I’m going to give them the benefit of the doubt because they’ve only been open for a week). Overall, one of the best meals I’ve had in the Peace Plaza!< /Review><Date>1545167569244< /Date><userid>115421698500047200622< /userid><rate>5< /rate><Name>Mayumi N< /Name><gmapID>0x80858145f40b31e1:0x283a08661e21a5ce< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Food, prices, and service are mighty generous. It's your typical mom and pops Cafe and feels very homely. Food is fantastic and delicious.

I had their birria omelet and their mini tacos. The birria is not bad and their mini tacos, but they're still delicious.

I can't wait to come back and try some more of their food.< /Review>

Was trying to find the old filipino restaurant that was here. But since this took its place I figured might as well have brunch here.

Food is fairly good, at low prices. The service is top notch.</review>

This food is incredible! We were fortunate to stop in and Guillermo prepared a nice spread of Guatemalan dishes that we shared at the table.
It was super hard to finish the food because the cafe de la olla is brought to you in a caraf and its so very hard to stop drinking something so warm, comforting and delicious.
I am enthusiastic about going back and sampling more of Guillermo's kitchen skills.<//text>

<text>The food and service was INCREDIBLE. The Guatemalan breakfast, Chile quilles, and huevos rancheros were phenomenal. Quite frankly all the food on the menu looked delectable, it was hard to decide what to eat! The owners were so sweet and hospitable as well.

The food here is AMAZING. Serving sizes are incredibly generous for their price. The best horchata including refills, homemade salsa.. ARM SIZED BURRITOS. Puts all other Californian restaurants to shame. The owner is so friendly and will custom make your orders, everything is fresh. My husband and I come here at least twice a week, it's the only thing we will miss from California. Military discounts, family owned, great customer service, and delicious homemade food for great prices.. what else could you ask for? They even lend out the restaurant for parties and get togethers, food and drinks included. So glad we found this place 💕< /review>

Been there twice now and I will continue coming back. The atmosphere feels like you’re with family and the food is the bomb! I have little ones with me and even they love it. Best thing is the horchata. It is freshly made daily.< /review>

Wonderful, small, family owed restaurant. Service was fast. They set our 11 person family up on the patio. Food was just like a home cooked Mexican meal. Good portions. Great prices. We certainly will make this our go to place on every trip to San Diego. Thank you guys 😊<//Text>

Do not rent the venue for your event. The owner is super unprofessional, there are no contracts signed, I cancelled my date 13 days before my event, left a detailed voicemail due a car emergency and he never returned my call, and now he’s trying to steal my $100 deposit. I’m a single mom with a full time job struggling with this pandemic and this man is trying to rob me! It’s not fair!!! gonna have to sue him.< /Review>

My boyfriend found a hair in his food and everything was kinda cold like they made one plate and had the other one waiting. I ordered pancakes on the side of my "steak and eggs" and I'm glad my boyfriend tried his before I tried mine. He didn't say they were bad just that they tasted like pan dulce but not in a good way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ idk. My steak was honestly like the ones you would in a pack at the grocery store. I wanted to love this place but maybe we just ordered the wrong things 🤷🏽‍♀️</text><user_id>116835707165712273309<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80d9523753c3fba7:0x9a41c50e8af1e71e<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

<rating>4</rating><Review>Ordered the shrimp tequila pasta to go and it came with a side of garlic bread with parmesan cheese on top. The pasta was really good! It's got that Alfredo taste with a little mix of Hispanic in there. Server seemed friendly too. The only thing I have negative about the order though is the fact that there was a glass bead (a decent size too) in my food. Thankfully I saw it before biting on it. Also, they offer military discount!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This place is rented for special events. A total of $ 1, 100 for 60 people, tables, chairs and a brocolin, which install it in the parking lot, I found dangerous. lunch included. On this occasion birria de res was requested. Which was meat stitched without flavor. Beans and rice. Fresh waters (jamaica and horchata) and music.
The place is fine but it is very small and the food was not what was agreed.

Good if you like long waits. Online check in doesn't work. Checked in with a 30 minute wait online. 30 minutes later it was at 35 minutes. From there it went to a 50 wait. When I went to the location I was told a staffing reason but didn't get an apology. I've been coming to this location for about five years but thus will probably be the last.</review>

Great experience for the most part. They offer a military discount which is nice. They also keep notes in their system of how you got your hair cut so that you can expect a similar experience each time you go in there. Would highly suggest them over some of the other chain haircut places.

I would just say that you probably want to try and check in online so that your wait isnt too long. The wait can get a bit lengthy if you dont.</text>

Staff are nice and professional. This is my spot when I can't get in to my normal barber.

Edit: I've been back here many times since my 2 star review. They deserve 5 stars.  My experiences have all been positive. The service here is great and they really take the time to make sure you like your haircut. Dexe is the best!

Went there and got a great haircut on my lunch break. Was in and out very quickly. The woman that cut my hair was great at giving me recommendations about my particular hair type and face shape which I really liked.

Came back two weeks later. Checked in online, 17 minute wait. Arrived 15 minutes after my online check-in and told it was now a 45-50 minute wait. I went somewhere else. What's the point of checking in online if I drive all the way there to be told there is now a longer wait? I came on my lunch break at work and don't have the time to wait that long. Waste of my time.<//Text>

She did a fantastic job, talked me through my first major hair change of almost eight years. Today I went in to have a tiny trim from the length overall and to take a bit off of my bangs. Leah was the woman who cut my hair and it was a big mistake. She took over an inch off of my overall length and took quite a bit off my bangs. And then without my permission she started to thin out my bangs and hair. As she doing it she tells me it will make my bangs more "fashionable". She rushes through the rest of it and looking in the mirror I'm really not pleased. I leave quickly because I'm getting frustrated and I need to go home to straighten my bangs. I ended up coming back a few minutes later with my mom to try and get a refund, because it's not like they can glue my hair back. The woman my mom and I end up speaking with gives us a few free haircut coupons and the name of the woman who did my hair the first time. She agreed that she thinned them way too much and shouldn't have done it in the first place.

It was not the best solution to the problem, but it was better than nothing.< /text><Date>1452370894913</Date><userid>117182468370351216763< /userid>< Resp>

<text>I mostly go here because it is cheap and is very close to my house. Depending on who you get you can get a great haircut or a so-so haircut. I feel like you have to know what you want and mention it at the start because they don't all ask you about all the options they can do with your hair.< /text>< time>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>The advertising ought to make it clear that if you don't check in online, you may never get a haircut.  I'd been there before, got a good haircut, but now I'll never go back -- not because of the haircuts, but because of their nutty policy that says that someone who checks in online, will always go before someone who just walked in.  In person check-ins -- arriving and sitting there, in their waiting area -- simply don't count.  So tonight I sat there for 45 minutes, while streams of people who had checked in, online, went before me -- most of them had checked in WAY AFTER I'd checked in, in person, but they still went first.  When I left -- without a haircut! -- they were still estimating that I'd have to wait another 45 minutes to an hour because there would be still more online check ins who would automatically come before me.  It's insane that an in-person check in can't be just as valid as one made online.   Really bad policy, folks.  Let's hope someone comes to their senses -- or at least have the honesty to warn consumers that your services are available only to those who check in online.</review><userid>105287174645702837554</userid>< user_name>

< Review>
My first time to this Taqueria, I was in a mood for a quesadilla. I originally ordered a super quesadilla but the gentleman at the counter took a moment to explain to me the different kind of quesadillas they have, they have an original one that is only meat and cheese, they have the super which is meat, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream and the have the Los Gallos which is meat, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and tomato which is what I wanted. I appreciate the gentleman with white hair informing me, that's great customer service in my book. I also order a small horchata, once you are done paying you go to the left through the arched opening than an immediate right and you will see all the drinks.
Their chips and salsa are really good, I hope they will make a green salsa soon, the facility is very clean.

They have earned my business I will be a regular here the food was really good and the flavoring was perfect.

I highly recommend, Management keep up the good work!<//Review>

I’ve been coming here since the 90s. One thing I can say is consistency. I usually get the super burrito and super nachos Al Pastor. Very flavorful and never dry. Always juicy!! Thank you!!!</review>

< review>
Came here for breakfast on a saturday morning. Fresh food, fast service. I ordered chorizo and egg. It was good but they didnt serve it with rice. I was looking forward to the rice. But the flavor was really good. My boyfriend ordered wet burrito. He really enjoyed it. It would be better tho if they have real silverware instead of plastic ones. It was hard to enjoy eat using the plastic utensils. But next time we wanna try the menudo since everyone around us ordered menudo.<//review>

<Text>The food I received was good however the super wet burrito I ordered with green sauce (chicken as meat choice) came as with carne asada. Now mind you I usually would love the free upgrade (chicken is cheaper than beef there) but it was a major let down when I went to eat my burrito and cut it open to find carne asada. While I was bummed out about not getting my chicken burrito the food was still good and for a drive thru mexican restaurant it definitely didn't disappoint. I just hope at some point management sees this and rectifies their mistakes</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I want to go back here to determine whether the clean tastiness of the delicious wet burrito was fluke or not.  I ate the whole thing, for gods' sake and that was after a small bowl chips and salsa.  The reason I am suspect is because we ate here several years ago and experienced the opposite: muddy, weak flavors.  So we'll go back and hopefully add more stars.  I really want to like this place.....their chips are very freshly fried so they're shatteringly crisp and salted carefully.</Review>

<review>My favorite place to get a breakfast burrito. The refried beans have a smokiness to them that I like and have never tasted anywhere else. The potatoes are cooked well and the bacon is thick sliced. When I worked close by I would frequently go for lunch and get the nachos.<//review>< user_id>

<review>I used to drive by this place and would occasionally see a line outside the door. I finally decide to stop in and see what the fuss was about.
Besides the place being a bit small, the food is really what the line is about! Everything I've had has so much flavor and is so good!
They do not skimp on the portions (see the photos to better understand) and I think the prices are pretty good for the portions. I've tried the Super Burritos and I rarely finish them in one sitting. I've also had the Super Nachos with meat and they make a good leftover meal as well. I have not yet tried it but they also serve Menudo on the weekends (maybe Sundays only).
They have a pretty good menu size as well as serving breakfast meals. there are so many things I want to try still!
Now my only complaint is the salsa bar. First, there are no signs to tell you which is which or the hotness of each one. Second, the mild salsa doesn't always look or taste fresh. I tend to stay away from the salsa bar unless it is early in the day and I can be reasonable sure it is fresh. Other than that, I still return and I've always satisfied!</review>< Pictures>

If you live in Newark, then you know about Los Gallos. I've been coming to this place since I was a kid, and will compare any other restaurant to here. This is my go to place for a burrito or some tacos. They have so many other delicious foods to choose from. Do yourself a favor, and come in and enjoy!<//review>

<Text>Good food at an affordable price, great service from the guy at the counter.
My only complaint is I got a water and the tap labelled water gave me lemonade. I didn't realize but it's okay, I can skip the drink for the meal (I don't drink sugar). Later however, one of the guys working there calls me out in an accusatory tone for using a water cup for lemonade. I explain the mistake and he responds it's ok just next time.
I'll be back (to try a wet burrito next time), and except for a little rudeness that interrupted a nice dinner I enjoyed it here.</Text><date>1608236170973<//date><Rate>4< /Rate>< GmapID>

<Text>First time. Went to the area got the super wet burrito to go, and oh boy I'll tell you what, that burrito was dam good, two things that I can not stand is to much fat in my burrito and under cooked rice, well in the burrito the rice was cooked well and the meat hardly had any fat. Only down side is that I could not find a online menu.< /Text><username>anthony bedio</username></record></dataset><record>

<Text>What a waste. Second time here and the experience was worse than before. The salad is shredded lettuce. The guacamole was tasteless and waterly. The meat was old and had that peculiar smell.

<Text>This place is hit or miss. Hopefully you'll hit. It's a bit divey and located in the Albertson's shopping center. Tacos are good when fresh. I've ordered food (just once) where meat and rice looked like it had been sitting out or maybe last of the batch. Menudo is good but basic - no hominy style. The prices are a little inflated, but a good go to for a taco fix.</Text>< pictures>

Although, I give it two stars due to the cleanliness. I would recommend to take the food to go. All the booths were dirty and it looked like there was grime on the windows and seating. Also there were areas in which water was coming from the roof and that had the possibility of contaminating the salsa stand. Additionally, the salsa stand looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while.</text><user_name>Indelisa Muro</user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

< Review>
I will always try and rate this place 5 stars when I can. I've been going here all my life. Since when I could start eating beans (most babies would eat apple sauce!) So about 26 years I've been coming here. Lately, the last couple times tho...I understand people come and go staff wise, you have to stay on top with the cost of living but plates are getting up there in price! I absolutely love the plain quesadillas, shrimp cocktail, al pastor plate, Carne asada plate, their guac, etc. I hear their aguas are good too.

Anyway, as of this year, 2019, there have been some notable changes in the food. I hope it was just the last two times because I will always come here with my parents whenever I can. Its just a great go-to Mexican spot in Newark!</Review>

Good Taqueria food, though over the years, their prices have gone quite high.  Portion sizes are usually pretty big, and the food they serve is very tasty.  Ok service.<//text>

well on 2 different occasions, they didn't get my order right on take outs, once the meat had too much salt it was inedible. It's too hot and muggy inside, and the selection of of salsas is always the same. weak, diluted , and not freshly made. the salsas not placed out often. usually the containers are almost empty and not refilled with freshly made salsas .they taste like from a can, all of them.< /Review>

Ordered a chicken quesadilla and looks more like a chicken taco coupled with the fact the dude that checked me out had an attitude with me for no reason. Rice and beans were cold and inedible. I won’t be going back.<//Text>

Originally from the peninsula where we have some of the best tacos and Mexican food for some reason I just can’t find a great place in the East Bay but I was hungry and decided to give it a try I got the basic Carne Asada tacos.  They put a lot of meat in the taco which is good I guess but it made my tortillas very soggy and soft and they rip even though there was to talk to you as per taco I tried the salsa and boy was I disappointment I tried both also they had the worst aftertaste ever it tasted like they added some sewage water into the salsa. I ended up Eating the extra meat with some chips that they gave me I making a mess on my hands with the ripped tortilla.  Would I go back never and by the way the chips are good on the second day the chips are so hard as a brick i was scared to break a tooth!</Review>

Driving around town looking for a late dinner we vame across Los Gallos. We ordered nachos, asada quesadillas, and a super burrito with grilled chicken. Everything was very tasty, salsas were just the right level of spicy and chips were fresh.  Only complaint was thw wait, but aside from that I will definitely be back next time I have a craving for some well seasoned mexican food.< /review>

This place is DIRTY. Their salsa station was super grimey. I overlooked that when we walked in because they were busy , so i was like eh, but after ordering I noticed that one of the workers refilled the chunky salsa station by just dumping salsa into the metal bin where old salsa chunks were literally crusted on the edges. We ordered 4 different items from their menu and they were all terrible. Asada burrito , chile relleno plate, ceviche tostada and enchiladas. Although our food came out fast , the beans looked way too refried (burnt and sitting out for  TOO long) , rice was incredibly dry and tasteless. Everything about this place was just bad news . They had 4 chances to get it right. The service was okay , but we had ordered to dine in and they gave us our food to go. Wish I never wasted my money here.</text>

This place used to have the best food and service. Now they nickle and dime you on everything, from a plastic cup for salsa to chips everything is extra. I wouldn't be suprised if they didn't start charging for tap water soon. Been going there 10 years sad to see that whoever took it ruining the reputation of the place.< /Text>

<user_name>Mary Kong<//user_name><review>Their burrito is pretty hefty, you definitely get what you paid for with the prices.

I ordered a carne asada burrito along with a fish taco, which came with tons of fish, which took awhile to cook.

This place is pretty hidden and if you are facing Mi Pueblo it is towards the right side.< /review></record>

I ordered a burrito for carry out and I precisely ordered it with no vegetables and salsa, and that is exactly what they put most of in it. The food is very expensive and does not taste good at all. The horchata tasted like dishwater with a touch of milk. First and last time coming to this los dos gallos location.<//text>

Was introduced to Taqueria Los Gallos by Coworkers. Now we make it a point to go there almost every week. Their Carne Asada and Al Pastor is amazing. Highly recommend the Los Gallos Quesadilla.< /review>

<Text>I'm very upset with the service I received from here. We bought tacos to go during our lunch time. The tacos where horrible, the tortillas was soggy. We had to eat the tacos with a fork. The meat had no seasoning and the sauce wasn't that great. I don't recommend this place at all. They were  disgusting.</Text><user>112357427873246112195<//user><date>1485573142342</date><username>Maria Varela<//username></record></dataset><record>

Such a good place, their carne asada is perfect! I almost dispise all other carne asada just because of how good they make it here. Oh and their chips are great too.</text>

I am TOTALLY addicted to their wet burritos with carne asada.  Nachos are good too.  No other place can hold a candle to it. Once you try this you'll NEVERwant to choke down one of those taco bell jobs again!< /text>

WHAT A PITY!

I really like coming to this location cause the staff are really nice and always greets you. The morning crew are great and always say good morning first prior to taking my order. I like the social distancing they have in place and their barrista is quick and efficient. I also like that this place is always clean and well maintained because I've been to other locations and some don't compare to this location no matter what time of day it is. Thanks again!!< /review>

They have a wide variety of Starbucks products you can buy for home use, with different themes by week.
There is no outside seating, which makes this Starbucks limited IMHO. San Mateo has so many nice days to enjoy a coffee outside.
Also limited parking available, and no drive through.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB1iS5U2HfHAZt0cchhO01CnR08V4nboySX7f0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5_5feLGGcvNjvAB1hWN5yndP3XiL68nPBoTqr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMO6_5-HjPnbdAwUfo9ySb1-ctkh2HQP8mQk6WT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmXT_qjkleSd026wSbFU2Heuzbwof5xIdMTrGf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Staff is awesome! 🤩 Always friendly, helpful, and fast. Even when it gets busy, the team greets customers with a smile and handles our orders quickly.
This Starbucks is a hidden gem! I love it!  I was dazed, confused unable to get wifi to connect with UBER. Then I saw Starbucks!<//text>

<Review>Great staff great service, but horrible parking. Don’t expect to just park and order when you’re in a hurry. You might have to circle the block or wait for one of the people mysteriously sitting in their cars to leave.

<GmapID>0x808f9ee1ecf3890f:0x8a44b10fb224a6d4</GmapID><Review>The service here used to be great but it has deteriorated recently. They seem to be too busy to pay any attention to you once you’ve paid. Today I placed a mobile order for two sandwiches and they were out. Which is no problem. But then they offered some cheaper alternatives and just brushed it off when I mentioned the price difference. Yeah it is only a few bucks but it is annoying when you don’t get what you paid for and in addition get sarcasm instead of apologies.</Review></record>

<text>The employees are great at this location. They have nitro on tap. This is the devil. It's the most addictive thing since sliced bread. It makes heroin look like cookies.

Btw the people that go here kinda suck. They really don't care about others. They park in loading zones and red zones.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

As a truck driver this place is a hit or miss. You could be stuck here for up to 5 hours or a minimum of 2 hours.  This is a UNION facility. That should Tell You Everything. Lumpers are available for a fee, so bring a com check with you. Lunch truck comes around every few hours so your not starving. Overall a decent facility. There are bathroom /port a potties available for drivers.< /review>

Warning:  if you ever deliver here you better pack a breakfast lunch and dinner. They are slow and do not care about your hours of service or anything else. They are union worker slow and very proud of it. And if you run out of hours of service time you're screwed because they will force you to leave whether you have hours available or not. Violating DOT regulations is not their concern. The security will threaten to have you arrested and vehicle towed off if you do not leave once your empty!  No matter what the size load five pallets to 20 pallets, I've never gotten out of there in less than six hours many times running over hours of service!

UPDATE: 4/1/2016
No April fools joke..... Today I got in and out of here in less than 3 hours !!!!!! That is an all-time record for this place!😄</Review>

<review>They claim to go by appt. EVERYONE HAS THE SAME APPT. Gate open at 0400, be there in line on the street by 0300. You can only enter from passenger side..NO left turn into the place. Parking is 3 blks away on a side street.. By train tracks!! The dock folks were professional and courteous, the only redeeming part of your time there.< /review>< Pictures>

What a rude and disrespectful person and on top of he's inefficiency as a security guard he was laughing at his evil doing. Workers shouldn't bring their personal issues to work. I'd never being to this facility, all I needed was directions. Everyone else was kind and helpful.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>This place never changes, I don't know why they even set appointments if they never honor them, you still have to wait hours to get a door and couple more hours to get unloaded. If you come, pack 3 meals and overnight bag.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dd2cd9ee2437d9:0x91f6f6e0e98948f3< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice little store.  Has most commonly looked for items, a decent liquor section, and a pretty damn good little "deli" with a variety of things and absolutely the best cheap biscuits and gravy  anywhere close to Pine Grove. Get there before 10.</Review>

I like the joint. Fried chicken and all the entrees for sale in the deli fridge are all made in-house (from what I could tell and what I’ve been told). Employees are a step beyond the run-of-the-mill convenience store folks.

They have a respectable liquor and cigarette selection—one downside is gas, cigs, beer, and booze are about 10% more than if you hunt around Hwy 88 for a better deal. Considering it all, it’s usually worth the extra cost for me unless I’m particularly cash-strapped.< /Text>

Outstanding customer service and friendly staff. This is my favorite one stop shop inroute to pioneer and upcountry 88. Also, if Kamps wont fill up your propane bottle, just go across the street to this place and exchange it.</text>

Great east stop coming into or out of the area. Good selection of drinks, super friendly staff. If you’re working up here or need a quick bite, the sandwiches are easy and perfect (especially on a  french roll).< /Review>

We were stranded in the snow one night and Nicole was most Marvelous. She went above and beyond helping us. She is truly a rare person. The world needs more people like her. We are so grateful to her. That was a night my fiance and I won't soon forget. Thanks doesn't seem like enough to Nicole.  I hope Red Corral knows what a truly exceptional employee they have. We will continue to give them our business.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Love this spot (its relatively close to my home so bonus!) But the fried chicken is AMAZING, great deli sandwiches and all the other deli items are home made (desserts ... delectible! Always a great selection too!) Full "bar" liquor, beer, wine selection, soda, basic quick frozen fiids and ice cream, snacks, candy and anything you might need for home when you cant run all the way to Jackson! Dont let the exterior fool you when you see the "Liquor & Fried Chicken" sign turn in! 😊<//Review>< pics>

I stopper tonight for gas, got $9.00 according to the pump, but they insisted on charging me $9.81.  I had pre-paid $10, but it shut off at $9 and wouldn't re-start, even with the nozzel out of the tank and out of the gas, and with the rubber seal pulled back.  I've been filling my bike for years, and it's not me.

The attendant said "Yeah, it's really weird, and I'm getting tired of having to explain it to everybody all night."

This seems like a scam.  I only gave them one star because the review wouldn't post without one or more.

Y'all be careful out there!< /Text>

Amazing mecca for a record collector in search of well curated 45s and LPs. The owner is very hospitable and will help you find what you are looking for. This place is a must and a highlight for 60s soul collectors.< /text>

<Review>I had an amazing experience visiting Rooky's for the first time. Upon arrival I was blown away by the mass qtys of 45s, which is what I came in looking for. I was warmly greeted by the owner, who asked me if I was looking for anything specific.
I was a bit overwhelmed by how much there was so him directing me to the area he thought I might best find what I wanted (he was right) I started digging!
Within the first 90 mims I had pulled at least 20 of interest, before having to run out and feed my meter. (You know it's a good dog when you have to feed your meter several times in one trip!)
Once I realized how long I had been in there I decided to stop digging and make my final selections. Besides the more expensive records for sale- all which were priced $5 or $10- there was also three times as many for sale priced at 3/$5.
After dbl checking my discogs where I have all my records I own inventoried (no more duplicate purchases- yay!) I narrowed my final selection down to 12 which I was super happy with. The best part was that four of them were ones on my wishlist!!
When I went to pay, the wonderful owner mentioned that I could bring him a wishlist and he'd be happy to see if he had any of them, which I thought was so great!
Besides how huge of a selection and the fair pricing, it was the kindness and helpfulness of the owner that really impressed me most. He was very sweet and genuinely wanted to help me and not just to make a quick sale. I mean this bc when I was about to pay, I asked him what Styrene meant. He explained the easiest way to tell and explained how vinyl esp motown would wear out over many plays, and suggested that I listen to a stevie wonder 45 I had in my hands just to be sure it was still in good playable cond. So he took me over to the turntables and showed me how to properly use it to  DBL check my selections, which I did. As a result, I put 3 of my 12 back. And even though he might have lost $5 on my total sale that day, his honesty and helpfulness will keep me coming back now again and again!
Overall it was a hugely positive 3 hour shopping experience, and I can't wait for my next dig!!<//Review>< pics>

If you are looking for vinyl this is the place to go. On a typical day, if you're at the listening station, you'll see the oddest selection of the Buying and Selling vinyl cognoscenti slink in and out of the back room as they work their dark deals. Good news though: The scraps left behind by these apex predators are an eclectic and fascinating mix of old and new Soul, Funk, Gospel, Blues - Rock and Proto-Rock and at fair prices.  Somehow I ended up with the new Nick Waterhouse (Self Titled) LP - and it wasn't even available yet online.

Word of warning though - the proprietor is not a patient man and should be approached cautiously - he really knows his stuff, but if you walk in there in your favorite loafers and no socks - and start musing about how well 'curated' the place is, you are looking for trouble (as I learned).

When I saw that the local game in the back room is Cassino - I decided flex my card tactics to recover my honor. I was soundly put in my place there too -  but ended up with a nice branded felt slip mat for my trouble.< /review>

<text>A number of records primarily from the 50s/60s/70s. Knowledgeable owner but can come across as daunting due to his deep level of expertise.

<Review>Phenomenal record store. Excellent prices, startlingly good vinyls, and wonderful staff. The ability to listen to LPs before buying them is something rare and priceless that really brings Rooky Ricardo's to the next level. Wonderful store! Would recommend to anyone and everyone 😊<//Review>< pictures>

If you love soul music, funk, r'n'b - you just gotta visit Rooky Ricardo's Records in San Francisco. This records store has got soul! And you can feel it through every vynil & through every 45. The collection is amazing and is full of rarities you won't find anywhere else. And it also has other stuff in jazz, rock & pop. Do not miss this little humble shrine.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Tried going there twice over the past week and wasn't open both times... just to give you context, I had to take the Caltrain to 22nd Street from Burlingame, and then take a pool cab or walk from the station to this record store. A plan like that is quite time consuming and requires clear planning.

But, despite me doing all of said planning, the store wasn't open on both occasions. Moreover, I went at 5.30PM the first time, and when I saw that it was closed, I thought 'Hey maybe they just shut shop a bit earlier today. That's alright... they have a life too'

But then I tried again a second time...this time at 3.00PM. After a long walk, mind you. I had planned my whole day around visiting this record store, in fact. But surprise surprise, it was closed. At 3 PM on a Thursday. Clearly they have their own personal interests ahead of business / customer service.

I'm thoroughly tired and disappointed.

I would NOT recommend that you go here unless you call ahead and confirm that it's open.

It seems to me, to be an operation run by real Rookies.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Dick helped me find Bill Doggett and other great honky tonk stuff from the 60s. Could have spent hours in the store. There are listening stations, the prices are reasonable, and the selection is for real. This place specializes in Motown, funk, soul, and rhythm & blues, etc.</text>< pictures>

Went there today to find some 45s. Someone (forgot who) gave me a funky Turtles 45 for $10 when it was almost closing time. Buzz Saw b/w You Showed Me by The Turtles. I also got a soul ballad 45 in mint condition. Nothin' Goin On but the Rent b/w Endless Streams by Kenny Carter. This store has good 45s section organized by artists, new arrivals, labels, and reissues. Cool store< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>One of my favorite places in town for having a few slices and enjoying a beer. No question the prices on pizza are on the steeper side but with the extra few $$ comes super quality. I personally enjoy the thinner slices because they give great toppings portions while less bread because I'm not a fan of being a fat pig. Salads are great, garlic knots are delicious and I recommend.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80db7fb307e20d2b:0x5cd798805dcdaa64</gmapID></record>

< Review>
I'm giving 5 stars for the pizza and garlic knots. They're probably the best I've had in the area. That said, the wings are extremely underwhelming (soggy and sauce leaves much to be desired) and the Caesar salad is probably the worst I've had.

Do not recommend the wings or salads (Caesar at least) but highly recommend the pizza and knots. Service is also very good from experience and mild issues in delivery orders have happened once in 4 orders (I would not call it normal at all).<//Review>

<text>Hands down the best NY style pizza in this area. I used to go to A Carini’s in Murrieta until I discovered this place. The crust is light, thin and crisp. The sauce has a perfect flavor and they use high quality cheese. I always enjoy going in. If you ever wanted to know what it’s like to eat an authentic NY slice, Temecula is closer and you can have it without the 7 hour plane trip.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-JhMKXomx4wDk-bkEw2eIqO2PBWjKO-9ZHWnX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvtWrFuMJHzS1ta2einqdZLaXGjWVj6Rlay6C2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjetn-7U9U2YQddYT098UMpkCAjPe84OBTq_2M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

Best and most authentic new york slice in town! Hard to find a good "by the slice" style pizza joint and this place delivers!... well they actually do deliver also. Good quick service for quality food! My go to lunch spot when craving some pie!< /text>

<text>My favorite pizza place for a REAL New York style pizza taste as close to that east coast taste that you can get. There are a lot of Pretenders out there claiming to have that New York style pizza taste but it's never from the part of New York that I came from if that's the case. I've tried many places throughout California claiming that but this has been the only one that has come close to that real New York flavor! The Taste I remember when I was a kid, I get hints of that flavor and taste whenever I go to Times Square! One of the biggest differences are when you are used to eating toppings on just about any pizza you order and you try a real New York flavored Pizza, you can enjoy it even more with just the cheese and sauce because that's where the real flavor is when it comes to that New York style! Don't get me wrong I eat pizza at other places as well but nowhere near as often as I do here putting them all together! If you want that real New York Pizza taste and know what that taste really is, this is the place to come to and you will not be disappointed by it! Now that I'm getting hungry just talkin about it, Time Square Pizza here I come!🍾🍕🍕🍕🍕🍾<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The quality of this place has really gone down. Used to be great not so much anymore . Pizza I ordered was hard and tasted stale ,sauce did not taste fresh. I spent 6 yrs living In NY and this is by no means New York pizza.</Review>

1. This is the most authentic NY style pizza, I have had since moving to CA.

2. The owners are brothers that grew up and have experience making pizza in NY.

3. They use all natural ingredients!

4. You can't go wrong with their classic cheese!

5. One of the few pizzerias that carry BEEF Pepperoni!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this about them as I don't consume pork.

6. STOP READING AND GO EAT THEIR PIZZA, THANK ME LATER!<//review>

<Review>Times Square Pizza & Bagels is amazing. I wish I could give them 10 Stars. I moved into the area about a year ago, and have tried many other pizza places. This is my absolute favorite. My kids who don't even like pizza devoured the pizza I got. Last night I ordered a extra large thinking that I would get extras for the next day, but instead the whole thing was eaten< /Review>< Name>

The pizza is easily the most authentic New-York style pizza I have had on the west coast, with fresh ingredients that are well distributed across the pizza (no clumps here and there etc.)  Their service is surprisingly fast (I have had pizzas delivered within 20 minutes of ordering even during prime times)  and the staff are very friendly when you actually go into the store.  Their bagels are a New-York style, so if that is what you are looking for they definitely beat out the local competition, but do keep in mind this means they will be much denser than what many people like.<//review>

Our company had Time Square Pizza cater an event we had last night.  The entire experience could not have been any more wonderful!  The owner was very responsive and I thoroughly enjoyed working with him in setting it all up!  The delivery girl was sweet as could be and right on time.  The food was AMAZING!  And the price was fabulous!  We truly could not have been happier with our experience!  I will recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone!< /text>

This is probably the best pizza in town, hands down. I'm so glad we discovered this place! Their portions are huge, even for a 12" pizza. There are so many options to choose from, it makes it really hard to pick a favorite from here. This is be the spot for pizza night from here on out!</Review>

Almost identical to the pizza back home in NJ. In fact I feel they are as close as you are going to get to NY/NJ pizza. I still think the water is the difference maker for the crust. When we want NY pizza we make the drive over to Times Square Pizza, they have not disappointed us.< /Text>

Times Square Pizza has become our family's favorite Pizza restaurant! We go out of our way to dine there when ever we want pizza. Reminds us of a true NY pizza cuisine...tastes amazing. Nothing like it anywhere. Try it and you won't be disappointed. Bonus, the staff is always friendly, and they make us feel like family when we walk in. Bonus #2, always very clean. Bonus #3, excellent service.<//text>

So far best NY style pizza in Temecula.  I usually get the special (two slices and a drink) of white pie and meat lovers along with a beer...always satisfied with the meal!  Priced well.  Great service.  Recommended!</review>

Finally!!!! A place that provides New York Style water bagels!!! They are so good. So much better  than the baked bagels sold in grocery stores, Costco, and other bakerys. Chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside, and so delicious. Only problem is they run out before 10:00 in the morning. So call in an order and they will have it ready for you....fresh cooked daily. The employees are also so nice and cooperative. I am now a weekly customer. One dozen every Friday morning.< /Text>

I like that you can go in and buy pizza by the slice, it comes out crispy and yummy. That way you can try all the different kinds they have. All are delicious and are thin New York style that you fold to eat because they are so big.</text>

This place is amazing! Little story for just how awesome... I was in the store and my kids wanted pizza from papa johns I said no I’d rather serve you bologna or we go to Time Square. Then a gentleman in line said to come by I’ll give you a deal so you don’t have to order papa johns. He happen to be the owner!! Mike said to come on by and yes sir he hooked us up and we are enjoying incredible local pizza. Support local business!! Love this little town Temecula! Thanks Mike!! We’ll be back very soon. Cheers! Small town goodnes and amazing pizza!!<//Text>

So originally, I was fine with the mistake but I ordered a SIMPLE one topping PEPPERONI PIZZA from the pharmacy and then the person (Cameron) took my call said it was "his mistake" then the manager Mike came on the phone said that the person who took the order said he "heard only cheese." Lack of integrity I'd say, if your own employees can't fess up to their mistake that, is bad business...def not ordering from this place again, and anyone that does, check your order before you leave...tried calling me a liar when EVERYONE in the pharmacy heard pepperoni...sharing this post with social media... it's one thing, to get the order wrong which I didn't care but to be called a LIAR by the manager...(Originally one star, Since review things were fixed, a great business it's just and quality product just please keep the integrity)#BadBusiness< /review>

Not quite on par with New York pizza but as far as West coast pizza goes, this place is the best. Plenty of seating. Friendly staff. Best pizza place in town.<//Review>

<Text>Service was good, got an estimated delivery time of an hour the driver arrived in about 40 minutes but then again I live about a mile away so I'm sure it could be a different  story for anyone. Wings were on point pizza was lacking a bit in flavor and a bit skimpy on the cheese prices but overall it was worth the price. I'm sure they'll receive business from me in the future.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>We have eaten pizza there 3 times & each time we were delighted w/the pizzas. My wife & I are from Queens, on long Island. Our taste & attitude about pizza is quite critical. We found the pizzas here reminds us of being back in Queens. Time Square is in Temecula & we live in Hemet nearly 30 minutes away. The drive is worth it! There are pizza places in Hemet, but we've tried one or two of them & we disappointed. So we don't waste our money when we make the drive to Time Square. The fact that they sell slices only makes going there all the better!</text></record></dataset><record>

Very sparse for a huge pizza.  I'd prefer a 12" with more toppings to what amounts to bread with overcooked cheese on it.  Which brings me to my other criticism:  the cheese was so cooked it had practically bubbled, dried out and hardened.  No soft gooey cheese here.  My husband and I couldn't cut the crust with the plastic utensils they give you....no real silverware here.  $4 for a cup of Coors Light?!?  If all the rest of the pizza joints in the world close, I'll be back....maybe.  I'd suggest if you want a decent thin crust pizza that you give Pizza Hut a call.</Text>< pictures>

<rate>3</rate><Review>Perhaps it is time to admit that looking for a great pizza might be a fruitless task. After all the pizza searching and eating in California, all we have accomplished is a half wanted result. Even Mozza which claims the higher prices, known as a high end pizzeria was truly unremarkable, but certainly expensive, with only small size pizzas and a serious lack of ingredients, they thought they were superior than the rest because they throw fresh herbs in their creations.
Enter Times Square New York Style Pizzeria in Temecula, CA, yet one more franchise in the ever expanding world of pizza making. This is where the waters get a little murky, when you hear the advertisement that this is authentic New York Style Pizza. First of all, I have yet to go to New York in person, but I have seen countless programs of their deli, pizza and quality restaurants. At the end of the day this is what New York Style pizza means to us: nice thin dough, plenty dry but since it is thin it passes muster (barely), a serious small amount of ingredient seems to be the official trademark of New York Style Pizza, maybe that is the reason why New Yorkers fold the pizza lengthwise (knows too many as the correct way to eat this pizza), and since it is barely laden with righteous ingredients, is kind of like eating bread more than anything else. I am sure those that review this pizza as the authentic item are, either from New York (therefore their strong defense for all things New York), or easily impressed by a pizza that in all seriousness lack about 40 to 50 % more toppings. We had the following pizzas avid for the best:
Pepperoni, 17 inches, $14.99: Not one of the aspects of the pizza was remarkable, perhaps the thinness the only true positive point, but that is about is. If there was cheese it must have gone back to where it was made for we had to let the imagination convince us of its presence. Pepperoni, another one of those toppings with no heart and soul, which is the one of the main problems of the pizza business: sub par toppings. 3 Stars.
NY Style White Pizza, 17 inches, $16.99: it seems that in this place 17 inch is the only size they carry, which in a way dispels the need to ponder and fret for what size to get. This one had the same lack of ingredients, just folded in two and nothing drips, and to our shock, for lack of a better word, a mound of pizza sauce right on the middle of the made pizza. How gourmet, considering that their sauce is nothing to write home about! Imagine that, ask for a white pizza but their delicate sense of taste throw in a big mound of pizza sauce. The other ingredients were: mozzarella cheese, ricotta, garlic, garnished with pizza sauce, parmesan, basil and oregano. Sounds like a lot of ingredients, eh? Not to be so, just a sprinkle here and there so you can fold it as well and eat it while you walk down the busy streets of New York. 3 Stars.
Do not get me wrong. I understand cost in a restaurant business, but one thing is cost, and another total thing is lack of ingredients and a dough that is thin but dry.
Service was adequate in that we took these pizzas to go. Perhaps it is time to look at the frozen section a little more closely if one is near home, and wanting a great pizza! 3 Stars.< /Review>< Pictures>

I live in Martinez so maybe I'm a little biased but my daughter who is at the Actors Studio in NY did a show with the cast here and she loved it. It's a cute little theater in downtown Martinez with a fantastic bar when you walk in and a whole lot of personality. The staff is fabulous and the acting is Awesome!! They have actors who have worked in Hollywood and in NY and the shows are so well written and acted. Engaging, entertaining, and just plain fun. If you haven't been here find a play that looks fun and go, I promise you'll love it.<//review>

Excellent time spent here. Very small place, almost personal, with incredibly friendly people. The people and the atmosphere makes you feel like home. I usually go with my wife and my kid and we all have a blast. Lots of parking available around. The tiny bar has wine - only $5,,snacks - everything only about $2 plus some very nice people that always have something nice to say and give you a big smile! Seniors and students get BIG discounts!!< /text>

They also sell alcoholic drinks to take in the theater. Nunsense used to show here. Loved that show!< /review>< Pics>

Marvelous little theater in downtown Martinez one block off of Main Street and close to restaurants and bars. On a rainy, cold Saturday night there was plenty of free street parking but I would imagine it can be more congested depending on the time of year. The theater staff was friendly and polite and the lobby inside was warm and cozy. Wine, coffee and assorted snacks were offered for sale. Our party of four was here for a play, "White Guy on the Bus". The theater inside was smaller than I expected with fairly steep stadium seating. Not a bad seat in the house. The production was professionally staged and performed by local thespians and brought to this theater by WOW (Women of Wonder). My daughter who just moved to Martinez turned us on to this gem. We will definitely return for more little theater productions in the future.</Review>

<Review>This is a really nice theater near all the restaurants in downtown Martinez. The staff was super nice, they have a full bar and snacks priced so you can afford it. I'm a beer guy and it was a good selection, my wife was happy with her drink too. We're definitely going back soon.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1532104030988, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the Stars!

Guess I was hungry, cause by time I realized I needed a pic, this is all I could offer 🤣. Finished It All!!! Dollar pancakes, eggs, bacon and grits. Good Eats and service. What a treat to finally have someone tend to me. As an Essential  Worker..  I needed that pampered moment. Thanks to Toni she was delight.< /review>

I would highly recommend Sylvia's for their food, service and overall customer experience. They get busy for a reason and the portions are generous so expect some wait if you dine in. To go is usually ready in twenty minutes or less and always hot. Sylvia's serves up great food at great prices.</Review>

This place doesn't say much from the outside,  and it's pretty antiquated inside, but we had a short time for lunch and they were super fast and the food was good and plenty!  My crispy chicken salad was huge!  The lady that served us was very friendly.  Will go back!< /text>

Sylvia's will always get a 5 star rating. Their food is amazing and they have large portions. Their service Staff is top notch and very attentive. Today is a sad day as they go back to County Covid restrictions with no more indoor dinning. However they'll still be doing offering take out. My heart goes out to all of the Sylvia's Country Kitchen Staff who's livelihood is being played with like a yo-yo. Until we see you again. Good Luck and Stay Strong.</Review>

I really enjoy their Mississippi Southern Fried chicken salad.  It was great. My husband got the Mexican seafood salad  and he enjoyed that. Their prices are high because of covid.<//Review>

I've been eating here since I was a little kid. Even though it's not the best food I've ever had, my family and I would still come out here once a month when we all still lived here. The breakfast food, salads, and club sandwiches were my favorite. I've probably had one of everything off the menu, and I've never had a bad experience. Nice little spot to come and bring your family.< /text>

Very very good food. Crowded often but quick seating. Servers will get you small items quickly. Kind-hearted servers and HOT good food. Biscuits are really good even without gravy.</review>

<Review>This place was EXACTLY what I was hoping for. The breakfast they serve here makes you barely remember your in California. It has a very comfortable atmosphere and the staff is friendly. Food was great and reasonably priced. I was feeling pretty terrible the day I went there, and this really helped me feel better. I'd recommend everyone give it a try!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80855781c64c1035:0x792a106fabe64e91<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Karen is the manager and she is very rude & disrespectful. I have eaten here for the last 9 years and the last two times I had the food it was cold, uncooked and nasty. I decided to tell her the problem and she was very rude & unconcerned. She was not understanding and said she doesn’t care. She said she is not giving me a refund if return the food. DO NOT EAT HERE THE MANAGER DOES NOT HAVE GOOD CUSTOMER  SERVICE AND SHE ONLY WANTS YOUR MONEY.<//review>< pics>

<Text>The food was not as good as I was told. The service was excellent as expected however the restaurant was not clean.  The carpet was old and stained with food. The cook area was trash littered on the floor. There was an abundance of used paper towel on women's restroom floor. Other than that it smelled as if recently cleaned.< /Text><gmapID>0x80855781c64c1035:0x792a106fabe64e91</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The parking lot is always filled but it's never too busy, you could always find parking. Sometimes in the mornings especially the weekends, it is pretty busier than usual so I go earlier than when other people would go to get a good seat.  For the last 6 years I have been going to Sylvia's and recently I've been going every week. This is my go to place and it always feels like home when I walk in. I love seeing the same faces for years and I am never disappointed with the food.</text>

<review>Sylvia's is one of my go-to places for breakfast and I always leave happy. The pancakes are big and fluffy, they will actually make your hashbrowns really crispy when you ask them to, the service is always great and the food comes quickly! The fries are great too. This place is a throwback, neighborhood mom-and-pop kinda place. It probably hasn't been remodeled since it opened, but I like it like that!<//review>< name>

< Review>
1 star for fast and friendly service, however the breakfast is terrible here. Water down coffee, over cooked extra crispy hash browns, ridiculous over sized weird smelling pancakes and rubbery bacon. After we ordered breakfast, our food came out in 5 minutes. I'm convinced our food was served to us so fast because it was not cooked fresh but instead pre-cooked and sitting under hot lamps. That is why the hash browns and bacon  were terrible. I would not recommend eating here.<//Review>

Good home style cooking.  Price is Right.  Service is unbeatable.  Brewed tea is served with lots of ice and they don't meter out the sweetener.  I like be this place!<//Review>

I was disappointed today! I always get my grits fit satisfied, usually. Not today, they were served not fully cooked. I would have rather to be told and asked if i wanted to wait for them to cook! Asked for a massacre fried eyes. Had to send back today for right cook.<//review>

<Review>A sweet family diner! Portions were massive, the food was great, everything tasted really fresh. I got the chicken supreme breakfast quesadilla, which came with two sides, and just the sides alone could have probably been a full meal at any other restaurant. I chose the Texas French toast and a side of fruit, and the fruit was actually fresh, like straight from the produce aisle to your plate. I had to take a box home with half the quesadilla, which will be a filling lunch. Will go back when i'm in the neighborhood!</Review><response>None<//response><username>Suzanne Yada</username>< time>

<review>My food looked really good when it came out. Only problem: I asked for shelled eggs. When I pointed out that the eggs were processed, the Jedi mind tricks began. When the server couldn’t convince me that the eggs were shelled, she began to scrape them off of my plate. I was pretty much done at that, and told her to just take the plate back. After some time, the manager came out. The manager was a Jedi too. She also tried to convince me that the eggs were shelled. When she saw that I couldn’t be convinced, she finally admitted that she simply would not honor my request for shelled eggs. If I were to order my eggs over easy, they would crack some, but scrambled... That’s a ludicrous request. So they lost a customer, and I didn’t get a meal, because when it comes to scrambling eggs out of a shell: “we simply don’t do that here.” 🧐👎🏽</review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>When I went on a Friday afternoon was quiet. I had the 3 and 3 appetizer.. the potato skins were  good.  One friend had their Tuna Melt  he liked it and my fam had the roast beef dinner which he didn't like. He said the gravy was nasty and it literally  covered everything except  for the  steamed veggies  he got.</Review>< Pictures>

For example, They take longer  then what's expected to get your food To you And also the waitress  I had was  forgetful. Plus It took a long time for the waitress to giving me my check. To the point where I had to ask another waitress.<//review>< pictures>

This place has been in Antioch forever and I've seen it crowded more than once but never stopped. Yesterday I finally decided to give it a try. The place is not much to look at (kinda dirty ceilings) but the line to order and get food was fairly long. Its actually a hot dog/hamburger place but they also offer Gyros, Greek salad and baklava so I thought I'd try it. While I was waiting I saw a lot of people ordering the chili cheese fries and hot dogs but more than one person was ordering the Gyros and I heard several people talking about this being the best place to get Gyros. I can tell you the salad was great! I will definitely be going back.<//review>

Great food! Everything made from scratch daily! Fresh baked muffins sell out quickly, large portions of good hearty food. The service us excellent! Mercedes   our waitress was attentive, kept hot fresh coffee flowing and delivered piping hot breakfast promptly! This is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant! A must try when in Antioch and conveniently located right off the freeway!<//review>

Excellent service, great atmosphere, and plenty of good food on your plate, chances are that you'll be taking a sizeable amount home with you, because there's just so much on your plate.

The absolute best of its kind anywhere off of Highway 4, from breakfast, lunch, to dinner! I normally get chicken fried steak and eggs,for breakfast. If it's lunch I get the Marissa's melt sandwich, and for dinner half a fried chicken- if there's any left! HUGE portions, When I eat here, I normally don't eat the rest of the day LOL.They treat u like family, an they're serving up Mom's home cooking!</Review>

<Text>Being that I live 2 minutes away from this place... I've gone here quite a few times hoping it would get better but it just hasn't met my expectations as far as dinners and lunches go. Breakfast is another story... As it is really good no matter what I've tried... The breakfast rocks. I wish their lunch menu and dinner menu had better quality foods... But everything I've tried from the lasagna to the burgers just aren't that great. With that being said I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast... As the quality is fantastic and the value is awesome... Mixed with huge portions this is a great place to eat for breakfast.< /Text>< Pics>

Sylvia's kitchen is a nice place to go for family dining, or business lunch/dinner, or large parties.  They offer a wonderful selection of fresh food and beverage choices, and are vegetarian/keto diet friendly.  Great service and food portions for the value. $$</Text>

This was my first time eating from Sylvia’s Country Kitchen. A phone order, the food was great, I honestly have no complaint, large potions, deliciously cooked, I enjoyed it! Oh and the service over the phone was great and patiently taken. I lived right up the street for five years and didn’t know the food and service was this good. Thanks</Review>

Good food, kind staff, decent prices. I'd reccomend sharing a plate with someone though because the portions are really big. Worth the price for sure< /Text>

<Review>WORST MEAL IN THE 20YRS I'VE BEEN A CUSTOMER. So bad I  will NEVER go back. Service was slow and the staff was indifferent. Country potatoes????More like pan fried potato chips.  Coffee was not as good as it used to be. I think Sylvia's has been sold and it's gone downhill. Also first time there were very few customers(usually packed)...some left after getting tired of waiting to be acknowledged after being seated.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I had the peach pancakes. They were huge and the peaches tasted like they were meant for peach cobbler. I didn't see too many healthy options and struggled to find a meat free lunch option, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.<//review>

Be prepared for good food and large portions. I always have to take something Home. It's really a local family favorite that is always a treat for me when I want to just relax and be around friendly characters. I had the evangeline omelette with country potatoes and grits (they do a good grit), awesome.<//review>

Omg, we just went and ate at sylvia's Country kitchen and this roach was crawling all on the table and on the seat..the manager Karen was so rude when we brought it to her attention! I'm sure this place has to be invested! Not cool how she handled this situation... it's been reported to health inspectors and Yelp! I understand roaches are subject to be in restaurants but when their coming out in the dining room area there's a huge problem!< /Review>

Cons- Coffee is not the best quality. Limited to only half-half creamer. Would be nice to have more creamer options.

Summary - Prices are a little USPS that but well worth It!!! Great experience if your looking for the family feel type restaurant!<//Text>< username>

This place is second to none! Customer service is awesome.  From the time you hit the front door, to being served, through eating the delicious homestyle cooking, this place is always on point. They are very patriotic and clearly have their regulars but I felt just as welcomed as the regulars. The food....the food...it's no wonder this place is always busy. It's not your regular commercial diner. You can taste it's homemade and made with love. Truly a gem in the East Bay!< /Text>

We've been visiting Sylvia's for 25+ years, amazing breakfast and dinner menu. Top notch service and you always leave full. Hope they are around for many more years to come< /text>

back again for lunch. I came from Stockton, worth the drive. And they even had it all decorated
for Easter, that shows they care a lot. Keep up the great job.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Pros - Portion sizes are large! Very friendly staff. The customer service is great and staff will answer any questions you have. They know their product.
Cons- Coffee is not the best quality. Limited to only half-half creamer. Would be nice to have more creamer options.

Summary - Prices are a little USPS that but well worth It!!! Great experience if your looking for the family feel type restaurant!</Review>

Very good food but unbuckle your belt, the portions are pretty big. I love their all day breakfast!  It's a very popular place so holidays may mean long wait times, but it can be well worth it.<//review>

I was there this morning
I ordered a great and healthy sandwich. Tuna salad one sunny sided up egg and avocado umm was so good.
I also got the Mexican vegetable soup, it was so flavored.
I love coming here because of the quality and the value of the food is perfect.
Ladies at the front are so friendly<//review>

Antioch staple for breakfast. Been going here forever and ever. Always good food and super service! Even when there is a line out the door they still keep checking in to see if you need anything. Long time supporters of military and police/fire/ems too. Food portions are insane and a regular pancake is as big as a plate. The pony cakes are still big themselves. If you are going on a Sunday go early or around lunchtime to avoid the huge wait.</Text>

Best place in the Delta for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The staff is awesome and personable. Your money and time will not be wasted. Remember this, Sylvia's is not a fast food joint. This place can get packed fast on the weekends between 11am to 1pm so plan well. They have a wide variety of food for kids and some great desserts. The seatings are comfortable and the ambiance is definitely country; however, the restaurant clientele is diverse. Experience Sylvia's and you experience love.</review>

An Antioch classic, Sylvia's has that small town diner feel. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. It's one of those diner's where you just know half the guests are regulars because the food is just so good!
To top it all off, the restaurant is always decorated with seasonal flare.< /text>

Best breakfast spot in town! Whenever I'm able to visit Antioch, I'll always make my way here. I've got to have my AJs omelette. It's the only thing I get when here. Sylvia's loses a star only because today the grapes were soft and the extra crispy hash browns I requested came to the table like mashed potatoes. Bleh! That was disappointing but the omelette wasn't. The portions are very large for such a low price. You won't leave here hungry or broke! Comfortable atmosphere. Ample free parking. And friendly attentive service. I'll be back and still recommend.< /review>

Best breakfast spot in town! Whenever I'm able to visit Antioch, I'll always make my way here. I've got to have my AJs omelette. It's the only thing I get when here. Sylvia's loses a star only because today the grapes were soft and the extra crispy hash browns I requested came to the table like mashed potatoes. Bleh! That was disappointing but the omelette wasn't. The portions are very large for such a low price. You won't leave here hungry or broke! Comfortable atmosphere. Ample free parking. And friendly attentive service. I'll be back and still recommend.</text>

Easy if you ordered it from Sylvia's.. when they brought out the food it looked so unappetizing, I  bet they serve better food in prison.. the first bite I took I knew I was done.. my husband saw the look on my face and knew he made a bad decision bring me here.. all I  heard throughout the meal was,  I'm so sorry babe never again... and never again it shall be.. I  wish I had taken a picture of what I ordered... what a waste of time and money.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I'm a regular at Sylvia's and I know all the workers there. Not once have I ever had a problem. Food always good and there on time. Yes it gets busy sometimes and thats OK. They love my son and daughter there. Deb is usually who serves me and gotta say her customer service is impeccable. You guys at Sylvia's keep up the good work. From your friend who buys everyone breakfast. Mercedes it will get better.</text>

<Review>Really good portions & customer service. They treat you like family here & help you above and beyond.

I felt really comfortable here even though it was packed I dident feel rushed by anyone to hurry up & get out.

The prices are good and it's a very American cozy vibe here but the food & service is what makes it stellar.<//Review>< rate>

<Text>Honestly i’m torn on this place, I love the food here. The service though has never been good to me. I guess because i’m in my 20’s they decided to always seat me and my girlfriend down and then we have to wait 10-15 mins before they even come up to ask us for our drinks. On top of that both times we both saw as older couples and people who were seated after us already have their drinks and are getting their food ordered. It’s usually not until they see me looking distraught or trying to wave someone down just to get our drink order in!< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>The waitress was excellent, but it was getting seated by the manager that was the problem.  She needs to be reprimanded.

We had a reservation at 11am, and did not get seated until about one hour later, just before noon.  Yes, that's right NOON!  We were being continually told by the manager, who was seating people that morning that our table was being cleaned off, or the current guests were just wrapping it up, only to find out that was not the case.  Or maybe it was, and everyone around us was being seated.  Then I was told that our table was ready and they were cleaning it off, she even pointed to it, only to see her seat a family there ahead of us.....that is when I came unglued, and started having words with the manager, who then told me that I should probably just leave.  Yes, she said leave the restaurant.  Unbelievable.  This was the manager of the store.

No way were we leaving, I was not going to allow her to do that to us.  This should not go unaddressed with this manager.  We are the customer, she should not treat us this way.  She is there to serve us, and if she doesn't want to do it fairly, and without lying to us, then she should just retire from her job.

I expect the owner to request that she give us an apology, and I will not accept anything less than that.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This is a great place for breakfast. I would prefer a smaller serving at a lower price and not have to get a box to take home leftovers.< /Review>

<review>Really good portions & customer service. They treat you like family here & help you above and beyond.

I felt really comfortable here even though it was packed I dident feel rushed by anyone to hurry up & get out.

The prices are good and it's a very American cozy vibe here but the food & service is what makes it stellar.<//review><userid>106237708595622152189</userid><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Date>1498260941082</Date>< Response>

<review>Food was hot when it hit the table, they go over the top with the amount of food you are served ,no matter what you choose to order and both the wait to be seated as well as the time your order is up are short ...so in short,"go sit and break bread with family or a friend at Sylvia's" 👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</review>< pics>

The waitress was excellent, but it was getting seated by the manager that was the problem.  She needs to be reprimanded.

We had a reservation at 11am, and did not get seated until about one hour later, just before noon.  Yes, that's right NOON!  We were being continually told by the manager, who was seating people that morning that our table was being cleaned off, or the current guests were just wrapping it up, only to find out that was not the case.  Or maybe it was, and everyone around us was being seated.  Then I was told that our table was ready and they were cleaning it off, she even pointed to it, only to see her seat a family there ahead of us.....that is when I came unglued, and started having words with the manager, who then told me that I should probably just leave.  Yes, she said leave the restaurant.  Unbelievable.  This was the manager of the store.

No way were we leaving, I was not going to allow her to do that to us.  This should not go unaddressed with this manager.  We are the customer, she should not treat us this way.  She is there to serve us, and if she doesn't want to do it fairly, and without lying to us, then she should just retire from her job.

I expect the owner to request that she give us an apology, and I will not accept anything less than that.</Text>

<Time>1496024448097<//Time><text>I've been coming to Sylvia's for over 30 years!  Geez, I just dated myself!

This is one of the best places to eat in Antioch!  They have huge portions.  I always save one half for later.

My favorite is the French toast. It's Texas toast which is thick and large.  I use strawberry jam instead of syrup.  My Mom used to make it that way when I was kid:).

I also like their Cobb salad with grilled chicken!  Amazing!  Did I mention the breakfast burrito?  There's a ton to chose from.  There's also that good old fashion eggs and bacon!  Anything you order will be excellent!

I order to go a lot.  I know the number by heart!  That's scary!  Thank God this place doesn't recognize my voice!  They're also on Yelp's eat24 for delivery.

They close early on Sunday and Monday but the rest of the week they stay open till 8:30.

If your in the mood for comfort food or something healthy stop by Sylvia's!!< /text>< gmap_id>

<text>What a great place!  Delicious food, great variety, wonderful friendly staff and a pleasant atmosphere.  Always make sure I come by when I am in the Antioch area (p.s., I NEVER rate places because I am a food snob but you can't go wrong here) - what a gem, what a find!

Maybe I have to try it again. The bacon wasn't freshly fried. I wasn't a fan of the country gravy it was tasteless. But however the place was packed so they must be doing something right. The coffee was the best think to me .</Text>

Only 4 stars because this place is so popular you need to wait, during busy weekend breakfast, nearly 30 mins for a table everytime we visit.  Their portions are huge.  I feel (because I'm a business owner myself) the amount of waste must be atrocious.  It was almost unappetizing the plate was so over-filled.  Food was  fantastic.  We ordered for a family of 5.  Everything from a basic breakfast to a lunch plate was top notch.  The service was perfection.  When hashbrowns arrived my husband asked for them to crisp them up a bit more and the server was quick to take back and bring a new plate of freshly made food, all of it- not just the hashbrowns.  The atmosphere is family friendly with coloring pages for the hungry kids to distract them while they were waiting.<//text>

<text>The staff was friendly my waitress was good I had to send back the orange juice becsuse I didn't taste fresh than ordered a sprite and a mushroom jack cheese hamburger with real onion rings..the beef on my burger had no taste the bottom of my bun was so soggy I could barely eat it it was one of my least favorite burgers I'd ever eaten I couldn't finish it because it was too sloppy with soggy bread  and tastless meat.i won't go there again even though the service was good and so were the onion rings<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I don't think there is any restaurant around that gives you the big portions that Silvia's Kitchen does.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner, you would be hard put to beat it, there is a wait at times, but well worth it.<//text>

I love sylvia's. The omlets are the best. The portions are big. Yes it is a little pricey but the food is wonderful. I have been there litterally over 100 times in the last 10 years and the only thing that was ever bad was calamary steak. I don't even think it is still on the menu. But everything else is delious!<//review>

S the seating is too close together the hash browns are full of grease and barely cooked the service is lousy although my waitress was okay you have to continually ask for simple things like silverware and straws and so forth it was clean but cluttering and the food just isn't very good it's not cooked well<//review>

(Translated by Google) I went to this place with my family and I really liked the attention they gave us. Although the staff that attends the tables does not speak Spanish and I do not speak English, they were very friendly and gave me and my family excellent service. And the food is delicious too.

(Translated by Google) Good food but waitress D .. I ordered 2 omellete of vegetables and I take a lot, then I brought it bacon and I asked it with other potatoes I changed it. I ask her name after another waitress arrives and she asks me if everything is ok I tell her that the waitress took a long time. Suddenly an SRA appears. And we were eating my husband and I and NOS ARREBATA DISHES with very bad education my plate and that of my husband. If that SRa. is
the owner that TERRIBLE never in my life had passed me this or in the best restaurants. I did not understand his message but that is to have no education or way to treat a client. A good boss or owner. try to keep your customers from driving them away. It is not the way  . I'm sorry for her she has no education

(Original)
Buena  comida pero la mesera D .. le pedi  2 omellete de vegetales  y tardo mucho ,despues me  lo trajo de tocino  yo lo pedi con otras papas me lo cambia . Le pregunto su nombre  despues llega otra mesera y me pregunta si todo bien  yo le  digo que la mesera tardo  mucho tiempo. De repente se aparece una SRA.  Y estabamos comiendo mi esposo y yo y  NOS ARREBATA LOS PLATOS  con muy mala educacion   mi plato y el de mi esposo. Si esa SRa. es
la dueña  que TERRIBLE     nunca en mi vida me habia pasado esto ni en los mejores Restaurantes . No entendi su mensaje  pero eso es no tener educacion ni manera de tratar a un cliente . Un buen jefe o dueño. trata de mantener a sus clientes  no de alejarlos.  No es la manera  . Lo siento por ella no tiene educacion< /Text>
