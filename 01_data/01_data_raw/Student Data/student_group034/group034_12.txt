<text>I bought my watches at Ben Bridge, I had a good experience.  But to get your watches serviced there is an ordeal.  I waited 10 weeks, yes 10 weeks on what they said was a 4-6 week job.  One of my watches works.  The other one does the exact sane thing I brought it in for (the date doesn’t change).  I guess they don’t read their own instructions bc they cleaned it up for me and fixed everything except the original problem.  They said this is an easy fix, it will take a couple of weeks.! If that is the case, why did I wait 10 weeks for them?

They had no answer.< /text>< pics>

<text>Ben Bridge jewelers are terrific; in both ring repairs and customer service. They were very helpful in repairing my antique sapphire ring. And exceptionally kind on making arrangements to ship my repaired ring to me since I am not able to drive there. Received my ring, sparkling clean, well packaged, and safely tucked in its package today. A special thank you to Dorothy!<//text>< Pics>

I am so thankful that I was able to get the ring that my fiancé wanted from Ben bridges. Although, it took a little longer due to the COVID 19 pandemic I am happy to say that even though curbside is only 4 hours I was finally able to get the ring. All the ladies that work at the Valley Fair location are amazing and super sweet. Thank you all!

< Review>
I came here to get a new watch wristband, and I’m happy Amber was there to help. She was extremely thorough about the process, and made sure I got the one I needed. I’m really impressed how she took ownership of the matter, and called me the next day to give an update about the shipping timeframe. Thanks for your help Amber!<//Review>

< Review>
Patti was very helpful in reserving the earrings we purchased by phone and even recommended that I come later to pick them up to avoid the crowd at the mall.

Lorraine helped to check us out. My sister and I really, really appreciated the fact that during the holiday, she was there even at 10pm to help us. She was very personable and went out of her way to make us feel comfortable, even though we know they were close to closing the store.< /Review>

Having gifted and received gifts from Ben Bridge previously, I  knew it was the place to go for a pair of quality diamond stud earrings for my mom. I was immediately greeted by Jane Wojieck.  I explained what I was looking for, and she showed me several pair in my price range.  Her patience and personable demeanor made the process pleasurable.  The gift was packaged and wrapped beautifully.  Thank you, Jane!<//Review>

Elegant jewelry shop with great personal service. My sweetheart needed a replacement for her small Mikimoto earrings. The staff was very attentive and listened to our needs. They've ordered the replacement ratings.

She found a pearl set with necklace, bracelet, and earrings. We needed the necklace shortened and they took care of it.

Definitely recommend Ben Bridge.< /review>

If you are looking for a special gift and you’ve been looking for weeks and could not find the right one, go see Leila at Ben Bridges at Valley Fair mall in Santa Clara.

I highly recommend and will be going back again.

<review>Being newly engaged my fiance and I were new to this entire diamond thing. After looking at a couple other places we ventured into a Ben Bridge and met Lorraine and Jane. Lorraine made us feel right at home with no high pressure tactics, all while educating and finding us the ring that we both love and will enjoy for years to come. Sales is more than just closing a deal. It is about building a repoire and relationship that will bring you back for years to come, and Lorraine cemented that with our transaction. She was friendly, nice, knowledgeable and really listened to what we were looking for in our ring. Thanks Lorraine and Jane for making us feel welcomed and being part of our together venture.</review>< Gmap_id>

Took my 10 yr old Raymond Weil watch here expecting to pay $240+ to have its engine replaced (as this was what was recommended at two other establishments). Instead, it was a simple battery replacement and only paid $49.16 all-in-all. While I can definitely trade-up to a “better” watch; this was a gift to myself after landing my first job out of college so it has sentimental value. Thank you Patti!</text>

One of the best customer service experiences I’ve ever had. I came in for some urgent engraving and the team went above and beyond to make it happen. I was on a short timeline with a unique piece so it had to be hand done. They even dropped it and picked it up from a different store. I hope both ladies get a big bonus.< /Review>

Great customer service until...
purchased a black sapphire black rhodium plated ring (black on black). When it returned from sizing it had been stripped and polished to bare silver on black.

When I called to confirm pickup they didn’t say anything was wrong, but when we went to pick up the ring they said that just earlier in the day they had realized the problem. Arrived on site and they offered for me to browse the website. They don’t even understand their own merchandise well enough to set expectations.

The selection ranges towards the flashy ornate so it was hard to find anything understated and simplistic.< /review>

Overall, an extremely positive experience. I came in knowing a specific Tudor watch I wanted to try on. The salesperson (Monique) was knowledgeable and helpful but not high pressure. She was also very patient with my MANY questions.  I appreciate that when she didn’t know an answer to a question, she said so, didn’t BS, and went to find out. Will definitely be back.<//Review>

<user>104436470049677345986< /user><Review>The sales associates are always very friendly and professional.  However, my experience overall was not a 5-star one.  I took my Raymond Weil watch in for a battery replacement.  Because I wear the watch in water, I wanted to make sure that a pressure check would be carried out.  The watch came back initially after a couple of weeks, but it had not been pressure tested.  So the store sent it back to the service center (they did not charge me for the initial service).  I did not get the watch back for 3 months.  I had to chase the store for updates and finally became concerned that my watch might have gone astray.  I do not know if this is a coincidence, but shortly after I contacted head office customer service, I was notified that my watch was ready for pick up. I found the lack of updates somewhat disappointing.< /Review><rating>3< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>had awesome encounters and experiences.

from my enquiring phone call, was help very kindly and professionally by daniella to my in store purchase.

patti was knowledgeably and willing to find me the right pieces to acquire.

instead of 1, i ended up picking up bracelets to my desire.

highly recommended to everyone to visit this particular location.

bought a raymond weil watch long time ago (1999) for my sister. happy that i return and pick up few items for myself.

i am sure it would not be my last.

will do a yelp review for you.

congrats to awesome customer service by the team of this location.

huge hugs.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808fcb1f954cec81:0x5307dce09df5e50b<//Gmap_id></record>

I had a fabulous experience at Ben Bridge in Valleyfair Mall...again!  I was so happy to collaborate with Patty and Larry for a second time, this time to create a ring out of a diamond pendant I had.  Larry’s talent and skill is second to none, his ability to create is incredible.  My ring turned out more beautiful then I could imagine, very happy! Patty is so fun to work with and her expertise is incredibly helpful, especially, when trying to create.  I appreciate all of her help as well.  Customer service is top notch, a big thank you to everyone at Ben Bridge!

Cool little spot tucked away in a strip mall. Bartenders are fairly nice. My wife and I, we always have a great time there. And on Wednesday, they have karaoke. A pool table and 2 dart boards round out the activities they have going on. Check it out if you're looking for a little fun and need a place to quench your thirst.< /Text>

<text>Great burgers.
Have a bit of patience,  since bartender takes food and drink orders, but she was professional and offered a bit of friendly ribbing.
Great place to watch football and hang out if you enjoy dive-ish bars.<//text>< pictures>

Love this place. Karaoke night is a blast. All the staff and customers are very friendly. Convenient location in Pocket area with plenty of parking. I am new to the area and I'm so glad I found this place within walking distance. Can't wait to go back and play darts or listen to the people sing karaoke.</review>

<review>The bartender was a great guy, talked to us about our trip to Sacramento and gave some good recommendations on the menu.  Their Island wing sauce is quite good.  Good place to go that is just off of where it seems the tourist are all going.</review>< GmapID>

I like the small food menu, they are getting their footing and making tasty meals. The atmosphere is fun and energetic. The staff is attentive and friendly. The one and only fault I have at this point is that the bathroom(s) have been sub par as far as cleanliness. I recommend this neighborhood bar and I can see it becoming a pocket staple.<//review>

< Review>
What a great new place to grab a drink and watch the game. I went here with my friend and had some delicious craft beers on tap. We ordered food and it was really tasty. We shared our food, but I liked the bourbon burger the most, great sauce and the bun is so good. There is a large projector so everyone can see the game, and the atmosphere is really open with a half wall separating the bar from the viewing area. Top notch place, I'll be coming back.< /Review>

< Review>
This review is in lieu of shouting at whatever poor employee happened to have picked up the phone.  Whoever it was that picked up got spared because my son started crying - good thing, I suppose, since it probably wasn't her fault.

Got 2 burgers. Bacon and Blue with kettle chips and Bourbon with fries.

Ordered over the phone. Girl was nice enough but not really on top of her game.  Asked me for my order then said hang on let me get a pen.....after I'd already given her the order. So, I tell her again. Then she tries to confirm it and gets it wrong. Nothing big just she said medium done when I wanted well done. No biggie.

Problems came when my husband got home with the food. His kettle chips were burnt and inedible and he had no cheese on his bacon and Blue.  It's in the name for crying out loud! Then my burger didn't have any of the bourbon sauce, or so I thought. Looked dry, none on inside of either bin. Then I picked it up. Sauce under the burger in the to-go box. My bun was just sitting in it. Then to top it all off and had me calling in were the hairs I found stuck to my fries! Just two but still!

I'd been wanting to try them out since they opened but hadn't been able too. I was so disappointed.
WE will not be eating here again.</Review>

The bartender there was very nice. The music was great & she made my midor sour just the way I love it. Also they also had karaoke so it was fun to see people do it. Overall it’s a cool bar to chill for a bit and enjoy the night< /Text>

Great food and good vibe. Place is a breath of fresh air in the Pocket/Greenhaven area of South Sacramento. Good pub/bar vibe with the food to match. Jay the Owner is a vet as well so go support. They will celebrate their one year this Saturday.< /text>

<review>I took my son there. The waitress/bartender seemed rude. She gave us menus after we ordered drinks. When she brought us our drinks, I told her we were ready to order. She said okay and disappeared. My son and I waited about ten minutes for her to comeback but she was talking to patrons and serving drinks. I went up to the bar to ask if we order here or the table. She said the table and gave me a unfriendly look.  After that, we ordered our food. She didn't bother to ask if i wanted another drink when my glass was empty, I had to ask her. Food was okay, service was horrible. We wont be going back.< /review>< GmapID>

Great beer selection. A gem in LandPark. The beers rotate from month to month and they have great brewers like Oak Park, Scrimshaw, Schmitics, Founders, etc.. The food looks amazing. Talking to people around they all speak highly of the food and it looks the part as well. The ambiance is perfect. Areas to sit as well as a back room to chill, pool table, and just a comfortable place to hang out at.</Text>

<Review>Had beer, watched NFL, ate lemon pepper fried chicken wings which were a little heavy on salt, but everything else was okay, oh yea saw children approximately 9 or 10 years old with soccer team wear inside of the business. Appears to be a family oriented place, I guess.</Review>< user_name>

Nice that it is close to home, but they need more staff. Seem to be understaffed every time I go. Wentvto get a burger one night, called befire to see how much longer they were serving. Was told 15 minutes. Got there 5 minutes later and was told kitchen had been closed for the last hour and a half.</review>

Great place to wait for planes to arrive at SFO, grab a snack and chill in the lot. Store as expected for ARCO, clean and well stocked, restrooms for yourself and a patch of lawn for the dog. On airport grounds so easy access to terminal entrance.<//Text>

This is the most convenient place to get gas, snacks and use a clean restroom. I like that I can wait here for flights, instead of doing the loop for arriving planes to land. The customer service is awesome too, everyone is always so friendly.</review>

<review>This is a great shop, good vibe and friendly barbers. I came in to get my mohawk cleaned up and My barber Kevin took his time and got a really close shave and finished it off with a straight razor. He also lined up my beard. Everything looked great and I saw the other barbers giving nice cuts as well. I'll definitely be back and I recommend you give them a try.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh2eeEr3cyPbVdXZ90zprt1eNnSy_Obf-lGtSk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTWQz_vtmOYYn2IympQZ1aGTs9jkTUl5Bgcxfu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYYYiM5HkXfkvUc2uZBvoD_B-2jENFkNia5vZj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcTLwTsR8PWgLBzNmgau6E0RH7X9oln77Keqoq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy0TTezlShkywNd8k_bWzDHUa7sryxh__XzhfL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfxJoHuZZ9WgYQUOMakrJWlwGZ-BHzNz14zzPd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dcd7f85b395eef:0xeb3d3b717ee6b32c</GmapID></record>

<text>Really clean shop and great quality tools and chairs.

It is obvious that these guys care about their business and their clientele with the way they keep their shop updated. Fresh paint and good music make a haircut here enjoyable.  Make an appointment if you would like to actually get your hair cut. These guys are super busy and would love to fit you in. But don’t be a pain and walk-in.  Be the Man and set an appointment.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Love how welcomed my son and I feel when I take him in for a cut, the owner just like all his other guys are very kind and do an awesome work. The cuts do take a long time but its well worth it because they are very detailed with their work. Its never hard to get in and be seen. Haven't found a shop that does great work like they do here, they have great talent.<//Review>

<GmapID>0x80dcd7f85b395eef:0xeb3d3b717ee6b32c<//GmapID><review>It's hard to find a good quality barber these days. The big chains like Supercuts always seem to mess up even the simplest of haircuts, because they don't really care about what they're doing. Tonight was my first time at Ambitiouz, and I was impressed with my barber, Andy, and his attention to detail. He asked several questions about small details that most would simply gloss over and cut my hair in their own preconceived way. Andy made sure we were on the same page and cut my hair just the way I like it. I'll definitely be going back in a few weeks for my next haircut.</review><date>1508466652593<//date><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><UserId.>114870714178609850646<//UserId.></record>

Great Barber Shop in town. All barbers are on point, don't cut corners. Highly recommend John, my personal favorite. I, myself been at the shop when Gregorio Petit (Angels Baseball Player) was waiting for John.  Come and give them a shot, won't regret it. Worth your Time &  Money.<//Review>

<Text>Their work is great.

Barbers take their TIME for that $30 cut

They are not as ambitious as their name indicates... shop is closed most of the time.<//Text>< gmapID>

Pros: Great customer service. Barbers take their time to give you a nice, clean haircut.

Cons: Long wait times. They charge an extra $5.00 to make an appointment.</text>

<Review>Great atmosphere, I didn’t catch my barbers name, but the dude with the plugs gave me one of if not the best cut I’ve had in a long while. They really make you feel welcomed when you come in probably the best barber shop in OC, you might have to wait a while but it’s worth it.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd7f85b395eef:0xeb3d3b717ee6b32c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Asked for a men's undercut got a men's undercut. They let me charge my phone that died while I got my haircut. Guy that cut my hair took his time and made sure to match the picture I showed him as close as he could manage. All in all was a pleasant experience. This was a one off visit while traveling but I'd go there again.<//Text>

<text>There is a few barbers who cut very well. I only know one Barber name and his name is Andy. You can follow him on Instagram @francocutz, I would recommend calling the shop ahead of time because they normally go by appointment only. Just in case they might accept walk-ins and your time is not wasted. Overall, good vibes at the shop.</text>< Rate>

I'm picky and usually have to return my vehicle after it Has a service done because I'm not satisfied with something they did to my vehicle. I feel bad sometimes but I can't help it, I like things done right and I hold myself to those standards. When I got my vehicle back from lombards I was thinking, "dang.. They did a good job". I couldn't find anything to complain about. You won't be disappointed with their work.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Tired of shopping in the internet buying audio you can’t hear or know what your getting? Yea I was too. So I drove to SLO and met David. He really spent a lot time getting to know what I was looking for in a stereo for my truck. We listened to a lot of different components and I’ll admit I upgraded higher than I expected but his knowledge of how things sound and the quality was much appreciated. I installed all the equipment and came back to get it all tuned up. Can’t say enough about how good it sounds. No distortion at any level. The whole experience was so impressive and I can’t recommend Lombards enough. Do yourself a favor, don’t mess around on the internet. Just go to Lombards.</text><resp>None<//resp>< pictures>

Very knowledgeable and helpful.  Had exactly what I needed and found it quickly.  Had to come here after Wal Mart gave me the wrong stuff and didn't have the correct piece in stock.  Showed up to Lombards a little after closing and still got some help!  Definitely coming back for any questions or purchasing I'll be making in the future.</text>

Called to ask if they sold screws for an amp, long shot. they invited me down to see if they might have something to help. It’s very uncommon but they did find one that would work and while I was there I asked about another product I was interested in, got me set up with the latest tech out at a very competitive price and super friendly the whole time. 10/10 recommend I will be back for all electronic needs for my car!< /text>

Extremely knowledgeable staff, Spoke with Angel and Chris and they really helped me out. Had a stereo installed elsewhere, it was done very poorly and tuned incorrectly, Angel hooked me up with tuning and made it sound absolutely awesome. Even if you do not plan on purchasing anything, I recommend going in to just get your stuff dialed in. They KNOW what they are doing!< /Review>

<review>They installed a Android radio, they were very expensive. I asked them to ground the the bypass brake wire, they did not, it was even written the the order. Went back and asked them to do this, they wanted $125 to do it, I said no.
Went home, removed the radio and I found the ground wire had been taped on the end by them, grounded it, works great.
I believe this was a scam to get mo money!
Just purchased another vehicle and installing another android radio, NOT GOING TO LOMBARDS!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Let’s start this review by saying that these professionals are, without a doubt, the best in the business. From the second you walk in the door you are their only priority. Have an idea of what you want or what you think you want? These guys will set you up with what you are actually looking for at a price that you can actually afford. I had to update my 1990 Dodge Dakota’s stereo system recently because the original cassette player finally gave up the ghost (I know, crazy right) and the front speakers were shot. After only a couple hours, I had a new head unit that could Bluetooth connect to my phone and due to an unforeseen complication with my speakers, Lombard’s upgraded my speakers at no extra charge! If you are looking for top of the line professionalism and experience, look no further!<//Text></record>

This is my first experience with Lombards and I had a high-end radar detector installed in my Sprinter. The job is done when promised and everything seems to work okay. I think I have a void one ticket already.
I will consider Lombard's when I do my next stereo install<//text>

Lombards Stereo did an excellent job of installing a rear view camera system on my 2007 Camry.  They worked with me on options and were able to integrate the rear view camera system directly into my car's navigation system display.  Angel of Lombards answered all our questions and even dropped and picked us up from downtown shopping while the system was installed.  Lombards was a great experience and their customer service was outstanding.</Text>

<text>These guys were great. I wasn't in the market for anything super pricy, as I am only sixteen and paying for this my self. However, unlike all other stores, I didn't feel rushed through. At other places they tried to get rid of me when I told them my budget.

These guys on the other hand were friendly, respectful, and didn't try to work me past my budget. They have good prices, and they didn't try to sell me something I didn't need.

Anyway, I purchased my stereo, and installed it myself, when I had questions, I called and they were able to answer them in perfect detail over the phone. Very patient, and helpful.

I came back in after realizing one of my speakers wasn't working. They took off my door panel, and found the problem in just a couple minutes, they had the parts needed on hand, and fixed it in about 30 minutes total, very reasonable cost for labor as well.

Overall I give them a five out of five. Excellent service, and because they are a premium dealer for a lot of brands, they over really good warranty coverage.

Thanks guys!

<Review>Best in the business. If your looking to build a quality audio system, these guys have the best quality speakers from manufacturers that don't distribute outside of their respective countries. All of the staff are exceptionally knowledgeable and aren't afraid to tell you when you're waisting money. (E.g. $1000 alpine vs $300 maestro)</Review>< user>

<Review>I had a new stereo receiver put into my car. It took about 4 hours total, and as far as I can tell everything works great. They are an official dealer for Alpine, which comes with some perks if you buy into that brand of stereo. These include service, and an extended warranty.

I would be lying if I said the prices here are cheap; but they are for the most part fair. I got the base level Alpine CDE-151 receiver for $150, which is exactly what Alpine sells them for online, however you can get the same model on amazon for ~$90. I ended up paying about $60 in other parts required for installation (dash kit, wire harness, and antenna adapter), and $90 for labor. There was also a $7 miscellaneous charge which I am unsure of the cause.

As far as customer service goes, 10/10. The owner, David, showed me all the different options and explained the strengths and weaknesses of each unit to help me decide what I was looking for. There was never any pressure to buy more expensive models, which I really appreciate. He and his staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.< /Review>< Resp>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Went in to buy RCA cables. The guy told me that the cables were 100 dollars but changed the price to 30 when I expressed my astonishment at that absolutely ridiculous price. I bought them thinking that I was getting a deal but then found the same exact cables online for 7 dollars. Went in again to return the cables and the guy would only offer store credit. These guys are con artists that will soak you. You can probably get anything they sell online for 5 times less than they charge. Stay away.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Not very happy with service. The cost far exceeded their initial estimates. I had to pull apart their install to find a defective RCA splitter that was the cause of a speaker not playing sound but just emitting engine noises. When I called about the issues, I was basically told "well we made sure everything was working so I don't know what to say". I think I expected more of a "bring it in and lets get it 100% for you no problem." I didn't want to risk another $100/hr, so I just fixed it myself after way too many hours of pulling apart the install to isolate the issue.

I will definitely be doing things on my own, or taking my vehicles somewhere else from now on.

I will admit they are decently knowledgeable and friendly, but still, don't want to do business with them anymore myself.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

These guys are crooks.  Stay away from them.  Took 5 hours for them to diagnose the problem.  For what they charged me to replace a speaker I could have had a new stereo system installed.  Knew insurance was involved and took advantage.  Stay away!!!!!!!!< /Review>

<review>DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PEOPLE - They're so arrogant about their service that they couldn't be honest in telling me that they DID NOT specialize in auto-surveillance cameras.  I was the guinea pig.  After leaving $500 deposit to order a surveillance camera system, I was told that they would be ready for install within a couple of weeks.  Two weeks passed and nothing.   Another couple of weeks pass - still nothing but excuses.  I call again after one month - nothing.  I'm told by Angel, "I'll call you!"  After 4 months of waiting, I call, express my frustration in communicating that I AM DONE WAITING and am taking my business elsewhere - please return my deposit.  They refuse to refund my deposit.  I have taken my business to a real professional who installed the cameras (you can see clearly for 2 blocks) for one-quarter of the price.  LOMBARD'S STEREO is less than professiona and is a rip-offl.  AVOID THEM.</review></record>

I came in to Lombards knowing what I wanted to do and I was given a range of options for a simple stealth modification install of an 8 in sub and a micro amp to a 2016 rav4.
The owner, David,  gave me the rundown and was to the point. They have a lot of options to the work being done. If you want the best in quality sound, you're going to pick the best wiring, which they offer at half off retail.
David was kind and informative and listened to all my stories without being pushy with the sale. I scheduled an appointment that he was able to bump up a day for me and even gave me a ride up the grade while they did the work.
I came from Oakland to get this service because you don't get this kind of quality service and experience in the city. They just want to push you thru so the next customer can give them money.
Quality service.
Quality experience.

The only complaint I have is their no refund policy.
I can see it being necessary for installed components. But a single battery bank for jump starting a vehicle that doesn't work should qualify for a refund, since it was not an installed item, but a seperate item.
Dick move on their part, but they made good by offering an alternative to the $160 in the form of a new car battery for another vehicle.
Thank you.<//text>

< Review>
I had no idea about car sound systems. I walked into the store just to get an idea about the different types and brands of speakers available besides the ever popular Bose speakers.
I simply strolled into the store and was lucky to meet with the owner David Joy. I asked him to explain to me about how to recognize what is a good speaker and what will be good for what I need. I showed him my car and what I had in it for speakers. He then spent about 90 minutes explaining to me everything that I possibly wanted to know and more. I was extremely pleased with his customer service. I don't think a Best Buy or any other sound system store would spend that much time with a customer.
I eventually got Audison Prima speakers and amplifier, obviously there were more expensive ones but David knew what I was looking for, he showed me cheaper options and played sample music to show me the how different musical instruments and vocals sound on the speakers with and without amplifiers. I must say I was able to make a very educated decision to invest in the sound system I bought. The installation was immaculate, the upholstery on the subwoofer matched that of the car. The rear speakers were perfectly recessed into the rear wall with similar colored grill, very good workmanship.
If you are an entry level customer who do not know much about speakers, amplifiers and stereo systems then LOMBARD Stereos is the place to go in town. I got what I paid for and will definitely go back if I plan to change my stereo system. I was a very satisfied customer. Definitely ask for David if he is in the store.</Review>

JJ auto repair is always so easy to work with. I’ve been here several times to get my car worked on. I got a smog, and an oil change recently. Prices are great compared to other shops. They’re always available when I need my car to be seen or worked on. Victor is such a people person and he provides high quality service. He’s definitely our go-to mechanic when we have problems with our cars. I trust this place and will definitely will be back if I need service. Thank you JJ auto repair.</Review>

<text>The air conditioner on my 1997 Toyota Avalon stopped blowing cool air.  After doing online research, I brought my car to JJ Auto Care.  Victor , the owner, explained the process, the pricing schedule and his warranty.  Satisfied, I left the car with him and came back after 4 hours.  The air conditioner is now like new.  Victor asked me to observe the air conditioning and to bring back the car if the cool air stopped blowing.  Overall, a very satisfactory experience and he did not charge me any more than the basic fee.  Highly recommended.< /text>< Gmap_id>

This is my local trusted mechanic for my  2003 Ford Explorer. This is a family business and owner is always quick to respond to my concerns and gives me a thorough analysis of my car's condition prior to performing work.  The front office is clean, organized, and welcoming.  I'm very satisfied with their service.< /review>

I was referred to JJ Auto Repair by my trusted mechanic, who is not currently set-up as a STAR smog station. They don't take appointments, but they were a joy to work with and were able to take care of me in 20 minutes. Victor was very pleasant, knew what he was doing, and impressed me as being another honest mechanic that I can bring my car in to. It's a pity that on Saturdays, the shop is only open until noon and only does smog inspections. That's the only thing that would prevent me for coming in for a repair, as I can only do local errands on weekends.<//text>

I brought my in the morning , mid morning received a call to let me know the problem, was quoted a fee, mechanic ordered parts and I was able to pick up my car in the afternoon.  Very nice people and mechanic very knowledgeable. I can trust these people with my car.  Thank you JJ's auto repair.</review>

Great guys, service and price. I thought I needed a new tire, but turns out I just needed a patch. The guy told me, "your tire is great condition, I can just patch it instead". Highly recommend them!<//review>

< Review>
Actually called Llantera Commercial Tire.

Got a flat late Sunday afternoon made it over to them and had a used tire put on in about 30 mins. Total cost was about $35. Mom and pop type place that seems like they just want to make an honest dollar and not worried about screwing anyone.</Review>

I always come here for my tires. They change them in minutes and they have the best prices. Very inexpensive and very fast service, none of that hour + wait time like at an auto shop. If you come at the right time when it isn't busy you'll be serviced as you arrive. The used tires are great, no gimmicks here.<//text>

This place is great. I always get good service here. I never feel like they are just trying to take my money. I've referred other ppl here and they too were treated well. I hate the small work space. But I'll get over it.< /Text>

<text>I've been going here for used tires since 2008. Great for quick tire replacement on old cars, the college kids or single mom who can't afford brand new at a moments notice. I send my mom, my friends, and even people looking for a temp fix for low cost. Never had a problem with before, EVER!<//text><Time>1481216316118<//Time>< userid>

<user_id>109408152828739166663< /user_id><text>Worst service ever! The young lady was obviously not happy to be there. 2 hours before closing, she took all the toppings while my family and I were trying to Make our yogurts. When I asked if she was closing she said "yup". And continued taking away everything. I asked if she normally did that while people were still trying to make their yogurts and she just walked away. I NEVER do this but as a restaurant manager, I would want to know if this was how my staff behaved. I called the next day and was told by the manager, well someone called out so she worked a long shift"... ok? I guess they're not worried about it and I guess we won't be back. By daughter and I got vanilla with Hershey's and paid $17 for it. We were so irritated we barely had a bite and threw it away.<//text>< pictures>

They are usually in the back every time I step into the place. It has always been at least seven minutes after stepping in, and no one usually steps out to get ready to ring me up a fryer making my yogurt.After trying to get the worker’s attention,  The worker’s still continued to stay in the back.
I’m am also concerned that every time I go there at night. There is always a young girl left alone to be by herself at night until the time she has to close.</text>

It says it opens and 12pm and it's  12:23pm and still not open. Horrible  customer service as well.   We've  been coming here for a long time and this  is the first time we've  experienced  this kind of service here, sadly.<//Review>

So its November 7 at 4:40 I just left here and I'm in love. I talk alot so the fact that Melissa was so willing to engage in conversation with me made me happy. I got some salted caramel corn fro yo it's Bombs. The price was worth it and I'm happy</Text>

We would visit here all the time but unfortunately they never carry European tart.  That's like going to Ruth Chris and them saying "sorry...we are out of steak tonight."  Get the tart and you will have some new guests</Text>

First of all the staff there isn't friendly at all. They don't greet or anything or they're in the back. Their toppings aren't fresh, especially the fruit. I've had strawberries that have gone bad. And the last time I was there a customer told the worker that the pineapple was bad and it seemed like she didn't care. We just moved to the area In the summer and every time we go they ask is we have a loyalty card with them a s we don't. But they don't seem to care is you don't because they don't ask if you want one.<//Review>

Customer service is the #1 priority next to having fresh toppings and yogurt. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I have discussed these issue with the store manager. I would like a chance to redeem ourselves by offering you 2 Free 8oz. yogurts. I have this set up for you at the Land Park location. Just let the spoonologist know you are Laura H. from Google and you would like to redeem your free yogurts. Again, I truly apologize for the poor experiences you have had in the past. Hope to see you soon!'}< /response>< user>

<Review>I'm not sure why it has a 4.5 as it should be closer to 5, but I guess it is due to the expensive menu. The pint is that high quality Italian food cooked with Italian ingredients cannot be cheap. This is an excellent restaurant and its delivery method and materials is absolutely 5 stars.
We had several dishes and they all exceeded the expectations of an Italian picky customer.< /Review>< userid>

Wow, what an experience of Italian hospitality and exquisite food. Lorenzo informed us of how this is a traditional family owned and operated business. Dad is the Chef, Mom hostess, brothers and sisters work the rest. We ordered the Calamari Fritto and loved the artichoke and zucchini as well as the size of the portion was more than enough for 2 people. We ordered the Arugula prosciutto pizza and that knocked the socks off. Tiramisu was over the top. Entire experience was so far and beyond our expectations. Definitely coming back!<//text>

<Review>Best Italian restaurant in town, it’s family owned and they really care about their customers and food. Very authentic Italian food. Not just tasty but also healthy - high quality. That’s what Italian food is like. That’s why people in Italy are fit and not fat :)< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Such an amazing foodie experience! We always crave Piazza's authentic Italian food that we even order extra sauces and pastas to freeze for a later meal. Our family just can't get enough. I also love the ambiance while outdoor dining. I also love supporting this family owned and operated business. Grazie Mille!< /Text><date>1598665150297</date>< username>

Service and ambiance were nice.

Our group ordered an assortment of appetizers which were good and an assortment of entrees.

The scallop risotto special was terrible. The scallops weren’t seasoned, were over-seared and tasted like rubber. The server kindly offered to re make the scallops. The second round scallops were cooked better, but not great. You can tell they were over seared still. Try quickly searing them whilst seasoned with salt and pepper and finishing them off in the oven.

The paparadelle fra díavolo was just ok. Wanted to like this place, but I think I’m going to stick to little Italy for good Italian restaurants.< /review>

<review>I love a good lamb chops, so I ordered the lamb dish, but turned out to be cubes and it's dry and chewy. The worst lamb dish I ever had and no matter which form it came. It made it worst because it's listed on Chef's Specialty menu. My husband's seafood wrapped in parchment paper didn't taste bad. We both had the exact same side dishes to go with our main dish, it feels like eating at a fancy cafeteria. Bottom Line, the place doesn't have good PV ratio (price vs value). Don't think we will be back or recommend it. There are too many other places to be discovered. 😉<//review>< Pics>

This little hidden gem in La Jolla is amazing!! The food is top notch, authentic Italian food. The quaint ambiance is memorable,  the staff was so outgoing, very accomadating all while being professional and efficient. The decor, seating and patio area is fun, lively and makes you feel like it's just you and your party dining. The resteraunt is kid friendly, reservations suggested and make sure to dress warm if it's chilly outside though they do have heaters.
We LOVE this resteraunt!< /Text>

The service was top notch.  I must say this is possibly the best pizza I have ever had!  I added an egg, but would get it without next time... as it just didn't need it.  They serve complimentary homemade focia bread and also offer cooking classes.</text>

However the food was mediocre at best if you're looking for authentic Italian food. The eggplant parmesan tasted like it came in a frozen package. And then gnocchi gorgonzola decent like a sauce for a package. The service was slow but I actually don't mind that because I like to enjoy my meal but the food was a big disappointment.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Amazing. The staff, the food and the experience of this restaurant  is unmatched. Every staff member is extremely friendly, the servers are very helpful in helping you find the perfect dish for the night and the food knocks the whole experience out of the water! 10/10 will continue returning for great food with great people.</Review>

<UserId.>102039766462705278144</UserId.><review>My wife and I are always tempted to drive to Little Italy, but the best Italian food is in our backyard in La Jolla. Fresh, homemade pasta with bold flavors are always found here. We just left very full from delicious truffle butter pasta, spaghetti with meatballs, and ravioli bolognese. This place is also very diligent in anti-COVID measures and we feel safe and separated eating here. Highly recommended.< /review>< Time>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I’ve ordered gnocco fritto and this is what I’ve been presented. it’s outrageous to call those 3 balls “gnocco fritto”.

the waiter was trying to convince me that that was actually gnocco fritto. I just suggest to never miss the expectation of the customer trying to convince it that maccheroni and spaghetti are the same thing only because they are made with same ingredients.

Gnocco fritto is only one of a kind and I know that Piazza 1909 can do way better.<//text>< Pictures>

The service and ambiance is really good. The only thing is the price is little high. As they say in my language"kasu ketha dosa" which means the service and food quality is proportional to price. :) This is a must go place in San Diego.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Simple, non-pretentious food and quite tasty. Service is fast and servers are polite and helpful. Family-style atmosphere, quiet and cosy without being boring.
Prices are reasonable, especially considering the location. The menu is well though out - not huge but with a good variety to which interesting specials are added daily.
Definitely recommend it.</text>

The lentil soup is so delicious here, I got two to take home with me!!  I had visitors in town who were catching a plane the same night I decided to try this restaurant for the first time.  I wasn't sure it was a safe bet since I hadn't been here before, but a first glance at the menu and seeing all of the activity on the patio led me to believe it was worth a first try.  This is one of those places where you wish you could give 10 stars.  It feels like a well established, family-friendly, romantic couples date night, girls night out gathering kind of place.  There is something for everyone.   Even your dog has two dining options on the menu.  The wait staff was sensitive to our need to hurry in order to get to the airport and while they were more rushed with our table than they normally would be, they didn't make us FEEL rushed.  We enjoyed a wonderful dining experience and left feeling very satisfied.  10 star experience all around.</review>

However, with the restricted capacity, our hostess tries to do her best assigning the tables based on any special request and when the reservation was entered. Our goal is to please all our customers and sometimes is hard with the reduced capacity. Hope you understand, since we would love to see you again, soon at PIAZZA 1909'}<//response>

Every bite I took was delicious. I tried 3-4 different dishes. Perfect place for casual get outs but don’t let the hostess choose your seating because she will give you the worst spots for some reason lol< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>We love this place. Score a free mimosa at Sunday brunch and enjoy their great food. The presentation is not overlooked here and their coffee really is amazing. With shaded or sun drenched options, they can accommodate parties from 2 people to 15 people comfortably. Also, don't miss out on their cooking classes that they offer. Talk to Walter and he can set you up. All and all, this place is a great gem to uncover in La Jolla.<//text>< Pics>

No reason to ever fell the need to fly to Italy for a meal.
Piazza 1909 provides the right ambience to make you feel you are in Italy especially if you ask to sit inside. Now let me discuss the food.  It is truly amazing.  It brought tears to my wife as she reminisce about the stuffed calamari like her mother used to make.  But when we had the gnocchi with Gorgonzola we were lifted to even a higher experience.  Gnocchi should be small and light as a pillow. Often difficult to find in restaurants but at1909 the chef can be seen making the gnocchi while you dine and truly has mastered the touch through his family generations.
Congratulations to piazza 1909 to the manager the waiter and support staff. A job well done.  To the chef simply amazing and looking forward to our next dining experience. Also I plan to take a cooking lesson that is offered by the Grandmother at Piazza 1909.  Great to see  a family owned restaurant share their passion and love for the art of cooking.< /Text>

We got blueberry pancakes and French toast. Both choices were well prepared. The pancakes were served with mascarpone, instead of butter, which was a great alternative. Also, fresh strawberries and Maple syrup.

Prices are on the higher side, but that goes for the entire area, and you get a lot for that.

Servers were friendly and attentive.< /text>< pictures>

Probably spelled that wrong, but we added a few extras to it and it was DELICIOUS!  First time ever had a gluten free crust that tasted AMAZING!

This is a must place to go breakfast, lunch or dinner.   The food is wonderful.  Anything you select is so good.  Drinks too.  The owners have trained the staff so well.  They helped us select our food.  Loved the menu! And loved sitting outside enjoyed talking to the people next to our table. Lovely people and place.  Great place to chill. Plazza 1909 is doing it right. Thank you for an amazing time.<//Text>

We ordered the Gnocchi Al Pesto, which was perfectly cooked - soft and hot and am awesome fresh pesto flavor. We also had the Salsiccia pizza, served with a spicy oil on the side. YUM! The big pieces of sausage we're so authentic and delicious. I'd highly recommend both of these dishes.

Spent $56 on 3 pizzas, crust was black and burnt on bottom but the dough was soggy on top to the point where everything slid off when you picked a piece up. That’s total magic, how high do you have to be to burn  and keep a pizza raw at the same time.  Total waste of money, listen to me, I will save you money on your vaca.< /text>

<Text>Really wanted to like this place but was so disappointed. Service was awful (never checked back with us at all!), the pizza had absolutely no flavor & the pasta was inconsistent & had an "off" taste. Inside music was too loud & the open doors made it uncomfortably cold. My husband & I are Italian & were hoping for delicious food... not the case here. We will not return nor recommend!< /Text></record>

I googled a restaurant nearby and saw that this one had a 4.7. First time, not impressed. Last time also. Kids pizza was charred, overcooked which affected the taste. Bottom of the bread slightly burnt. The taste wasn't very good. The tea had an after-taste. Ordered a three course meal for $35 and the portions were super small. I thought it would be a regular sized appetizer and a regular sized main course . . . Nope. The appetizer was two bites of stuffed calamari, like ravioli. The main course had small pieces of chicken which also appeared overcooked, and the wine sauce didn't taste very good. The only good thing was the desert. The chocolate desert was delicious but also a very small portion. Two adults and two kids came out to $115 total.  With the size of the portions I felt like I was a judge on the food Network with super small portions. I wish I was on the food Network so I could criticize the cooks.<//text>

Service was good. The reason i give it a 4 stars is because my steak and chicken breast was SUPER dry! But if you go for the pasta, OH MY! IT IS JUST DELICIOUS! The restaurant is pretty small but it's romantic.</Review>

I wish I would have informed while you were still here to redo it for you personally. We will be more careful from now on. Thank you! And next time ask the hostess to show you the rest of our space. Besides the cozy dining room and large front patio, there is a romantic side covered patio you might want to check out for dinner and a large private one in the back of the house. We have tried to utilize at best the original setting of this historical cottage house built in 1909.

New favorite place in La jolla. The ambiance was so cozy and inviting with the string lights on the patio, and the food was amazing. Went with my boyfriend and sister and will easily be back soon. The servers that we encountered all had wonderful Italian accents, and it felt like authentic Italian food. When you've been a server, you know what good service is because you notice every little thing, and this place definitely satisfied our expectations.</text>

Wonderful patio with heat lamps and good music.  Roberta was our server and she was very knowledgeable and welcoming. The food was incredible - gnocchi with pesto was awesome, cooked perfectly. We also had the Salisiccia Pizza which was delicious and a very generous portion. Highly recommend stopping by here if you are looking for a charming dinner after a day on the beach.<//Review>

We happened on to Piazza 1909 by chance and they were able to seat us and our dog at the comfortable covered patio dining area. The food was perfect, exceptional, delicious. We will be back.  And they even have two  dog entres. Our little guy had chicken and rice and gave it 5 woof stars.< /text>

Delicious, professional, and classy. I loved this place. I ordered a Margherita Pizza to go... but when I met Walter, whom I noticed speaking Italian, and he made me feel so welcome that I chose to eat there! I made friends with a regular local as well, she was amazing, and everyone that worked there who I interacted with was kind and professional; I didn’t want to leave!

Good for a quick bite, full dinner with family and kids, or an intimate date. The atmosphere is beautiful, and the location is perfect near the most scenic beaches in La Jolla and convenient street parking.

I will definitely be back. Recommend for all.< /Review><user_name>Kristen E. Davidson<//user_name><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>111553335562449791770< /UserId.>< Rate>

Just returned from Italy (again) and felt this restaurant was as close to a good ristorante is like in Sardegna or Firenze.  The bolognese was rich, complex and creamy as the best we have experience. And the cinghiale (wild boar)  brought back memories of the mountain village of Pattada.  Service was as close to Italian we seen in the state: attentive, but not pushy.  And while we chose to eat inside, the noise level was low enough we could comfortably talk to each other.  Also can recommend il dolce volcano and the portobello cocktail. (Overall, food at several of the other La Jolla restaurants were completely unmemorable. )< /Text>

<text>Piazza 1909 hosted our wedding reception last Sunday for about 40 guests. Start to finish, our experience was impeccable! From the staff to the chef and owners, everything was wonderful. They really make you feel like family :)

Roberta handeled all the details for setting up and planning our event. She was extremely flexible with the menu, very patient and everything ran smoothly. We chose to do buffet appetizers, family style dinner (highly recommend) and their house made cheesecake(divine) and cannolis for dessert. So special that they made our wedding cake!!!We rented their back patio and it worked out great!

Thank you so much Piazza 1909 for the truly beautiful memories! We will definitely be back!< /text><date>1534122621717</date></record></dataset><record>

<time>1562176545201<//time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>My husband and I love amazing Italian Food! We came to San Diego from Phoenix for a weekend-getaway, and were in the mood for some delicious Italian after spending a day at the beach in La Jolla. Unfortunately due my food sensitivities, there are not many places I can eat, and we have to be very selective about going out to eat. This restaurant is PURE GOLD and has PHENOMENAL FOOD!  Not only does it cater and consider gluten-free, Vegan, dairy-free, and vegetarian dietary restrictions;  their food is so AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!! This family-owned restaurant puts so much love and dedication into making their food, and making sure their customers have an exceptional experience! We were attended to directly by the owner’s son, Alberto, who made sure my dietary restrictions were met. I had the Pizza “Orto Fritto” with a gluten free crust and vegan cheese. This pizza featured an assortment of carrots, broccolini , artichokes that were seasoned, steamed and fried to perfection; they added an exceptional complimentary flavor to the pizza! I literally told Alberto “my taste-buds are cheating on my husband right now!” My husband had the Calzone, which came with Gorgonzola, ham, bacon, spinach, and marinara. He was raving about how it was “THE BEST CALZONE HE HAS EVER EATEN”! Coming from a big city, that has an amazing food scene, I will be very honest and say that this family-owned restaurant in La Jolla holds some serious culinary competition  against Phoenix’s finest. This place is a MUST TO DINE at if you are in La Jolla! We are looking forward to returning in the future! Thank you Piazza 1909 for an amazing experience!-  Cecilia and Thomas from Phoenix</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dc03e4b9bc52e7:0xfc907283e276033d</GmapID></record>

I gave three stars because the food was very good. Service was Horrible with the exception of Liam whom I believe was a bus boy.HE SHOULD BE PROMOTED TO WAITER..HE WAS VERY ATTENTIVE AND WAS CONSTANTLY SCANNING THE ROOM AND MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH ALL THE GUESTS.HE WAS ON POINT ALL NIGHT. Our waiter was very hurried. He ran off before we could even finish ordering appetizers for the six of us. It took twenty minutes before I could even get his attention to find out what the specials were that evening,Saturday night 7pm 03/23/2019.Appetizers took 40 mins to arrive.entrees almost an hour..BY THE WAY,WHAT WAS UP WITH THE KID IN A GREEN HOODIE SITTING AT THE HOSTESS STAND ON HIS PHONE THE WHOLE TIME BEING BROUGHT BEERS BY THE HOSTESS THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE THERE??ALSO THE MANAGER WAS DRINKING WINE AT THE BAR THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE THERE DURING A SATURDAY NIGHT RUSH...We wanted dessert but it was 10:00pm and didn't want to wait another 45 minutes and they were closing. I have been in the restaurant business for 25 plus years and worked in LaJolla amongst other places. All fine dining. Definitely a disconnect in management and service here.Horrible service. Will not be back.Will not refer this place to any other people...Piazza, you can do much better..< /Text>

<review>My wife and I heard good things about this place and gave it a try. Worst experience in La Jolla we've had at a restaurant.  This place was not over packed and were seated right away. Server came and gave us our drinks and placed our order...then things went wrong. After 25 mins we asked for our appetizer.  After 30mins decided to cancel it and just wait for our meal. We asked our server about our meal and he stated that the kitchen was backed up and did not know when it would be ready. He offered to give us the appetizer but at that point we decided to leave. We asked to give us the check for our drinks and waited an additional 10mins ( we only had iced tea and sparkling water). Bill came and we paid it and left. I asked the hostess for the manager's name so I can speak to him/her and I was given no information.  Worst service in La Jolla.< /review>< gmapID>

Very good food. Slow, inattentive service.   Everyone enjoyed their dishes.  Wild salmon was actually farmed raised in South America, a bad misrepresentation.  Had to ask for bread and water refills.  Tiramisu was delicious.</review>

No service.  The person who greeted us didn't seem to care why we left the restaurant.  We were seated in the back behind the bar because she said they were full.  In 15 minutes two different employees passed us by without saying anything.  Next to our table was a decomposing plant with tons of flys.  We decided to leave.  We told the greeter the problem, she didn't try to help, just let us go.  We ended up going to another restaurant across the street.  This place needs better management.  This happened July 30th, 2016 at approximately 5:00pm< /Review>

This is a good find in La Jolla. The restaurant that we originally wanted to go to has an hour wait and my friend and I were both quite hungry, so we went to this place instead. It was a nice surprise when we got our order and everything was delicious. I ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon and the cannoli for dessert. The bacon on the Benedict was not too salty and crunchy, just the way I like it. The waitress is very helpful and knowledgeable with the food that they served since we asked a lot of questions to her before we ordered.< /Review>

Piazza 1909 is tremendously underwhelming, even if that's not saying anything new for an Italian restaurant in San Diego. San Diego has an Italian restaurant problem and, unfortunately, Piazza 1909 is not an outlier.

This place has food issues, which I will get to in a minute. I want to start with service issues first, as those are more basic and speak to "Restaurant Management 101" misses. I waited 7 minutes at the beginning of the meal for my server to acknowledge me and take my drink order despite Piazza 1909 being empty.

Once he came by, I ordered the coconut water (purportedly in its own shell) only to be told after 5 minutes by my returning waiter that they didn't have it today. This is a problem. At minimum, if an item is not available, the server should tell the diner when menus are set down -- it should never be a surprise to the server that the restaurant is not able to fulfill an item on the menu, ESPECIALLY at the beginning of the evening. I was seated at around 5:30pm - and I suspect this place rarely, if ever, carries this item despite its presence on their menu. Unacceptable.

I waited another 10 minutes at the end of my meal in between the time my server took my credit card and returned a signable receipt. I gave him the stink-eye across the room at one point and he recognized it and understood, but he never apologized. Again, unacceptable.

For food, I ordered the Bruschetta, which was alright, I guess. I like my tomatoes a tad sweeter and less tart on bruschetta, and I could not really discern much balsamic, which typically holds this dish together for me. Also, the crostini was crunchy, but had a weird, almost "stale-like" texture.

Commendably, their lasagna didn't have ricotta (which is why I ordered it, as ricotta-less lasagna is guaranteed to be closer to the "real-deal"). Unfortunately, it also didn't have much flavor. It consisted of their "beef ragout" sauce, some very light almost nonexistent béchamel, and thin wispy lasagna sheets. Everything was overpowered by their crappy beef sauce, which was bland and boring.

More troubling, the center of the lasagna was not heated to a proper safe temperature. In fact, it was served to me at room temperature, which is worse in my opinion than if it were cold, as it raised concerns that Piazza 1909 was perhaps storing the lasagna at room temperature before an all-too-brief reheat rather than storing it in a properly-refrigerated space.

Chef Stefano Ceresoli may have an Italian name, but he has lost his way, assuming he was ever qualified enough to cook in Italy to begin with. From my experience, this food would not fly in Italy. It would not fly in NYC. It would not fly in Chicago. It would not fly in Bugtussle, Kentucky. Honestly, San Diego is one of the few American cities where a place like this could conceivably remain open in.

My waiter asked if I wanted dessert? No thanks!!!<//Text>

<Response>{'time': 1516309449704, 'text': 'Hello, Johan. I am disappointed you considered our toasted thin focaccia bread we use for our heirloom tomatoes bruschetta "crackers". It is certainly crispy as it is intended to be. A soft bread would get soggy by the juicy topping. For our Caprese we use Buffalo Mozzarella, while Burrata is used for other specials we sometimes serve. I don\'t think a 1 star review is deserved based on the fact you did not like our crostini. We honor and appreciate customers feed backs when they can be constructive. I would love you to come again to our Italian restaurant and let me guide you to a wonderful dinner experience. Please ask for chef Stefano next time or come in into my kitchen.\nThank you, Johan'}< /Response><pics>None< /pics>< text>
Extremely disappointing. Bruschetta made with crakers?!?! Burrata was more like a mozarella. Overall very overated. Better italian options nearby.< /text>

I just returned from the restaurant and read your review. It left me speachless. I definately want to address your valuable feed back and, first of all, we want to apologize. It\nwould be very important to know the date of your visit to identify your server and verify the course of the events.\nWe never have more than 15 mts waiting, due to the large capacity of our restaurant, even without any reservation, however, I read you waited 1 1/2 hour. Most of our servers have been working with us for years, from our previous restaurants and our customers keep coming back because they feel really welcome, treated not only with respect, but with appreciation and kindness. If you don't mind to take the time to contact us via phone or email with some more detailed information, it would be priceless and very appreciated.  I wish you can accept our invitation to come back and have another experience, this time one that reflects who we really are.\nI humbling ask you to contact us at info@piazza1909.com to help us go through this.\nThank you so much,\nRoberta"}</Response>< text>
I made a reservation here a couple days in advance in hopes of having a nice dinner with my fiancé.  Unfortunately upon our arrival, we were rudely informed that we would not be able to be seated until approximately an hour after our scheduled time.  After we were finally seated about an hour and half later, we had to wait 20 minutes to order our food and and another 45 minutes to receive it.  What exacerbated the matter was that our waiter seemed to slightly drunk and responded with slurred, snarky comments after I asked how much longer the wait would be.  The only remotely kind staff member here was the hostess, who offered us some meager bread slices as an apology for the alarmingly awful atmosphere and service.  The Pizza Napoletana we ordered (after the incredibly long wait for it) was good, however after this horrible experience, it was hardly enjoyable.  After another 15 minutes of being ignored, we were finally able to receive the check and thankfully, leave this distasteful place.  Unless you like being ignored and having snarky comments directed towards you by inebriated staff members, I encourage you not to dine at Piazza 1909.<//text>

Very good Italian cuisine that is cooked to order!  Pastas are made fresh daily and are complimented with great sauces.  The pizza is also very good.  The wine list extensive with some very good Italian wines.  The staff is very friendly.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The salmon croissant is very delicious, can be ordered, recommended
The clam spaghetti is also delicious, but it is fried without adding a lot of seasonings, and the clams give a lot of fat
Latte is great

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is located in the well-known coastal area of ​​San Diego a bit off-center with respect to the most central area. Reception excellent great availability and nice service sailing choice of wine and beer the level of the dishes is certainly very good the pizza tastes good but has not been of my taste I prefer to understand the Neapolitan type. If you go during this time, turn off the ceiling fans for the cervical!

<time>1533874100278<//time><text>(Translated by Google) We came across this place by chance, evidently the stars that day were in our favor. Flavors of home in San Diego with Walter's hospitality that makes everything casual overseas. Excellent linguine with clams cooked al dente and tagliatelle with prawns (homemade pasta by the chef). We ate a really good pizza with crab and mango and Walter honored us with a devil pizza that I took home for dinner ... eaten cold in the hotel it was really delicious. The bill is also good, I hope to return soon!

Siamo capitati in questo posto per caso, evidentemente gli astri quel giorno ci erano favorevoli. Sapori di casa in San Diego con l'ospitalità di Walter che rende tutto informale oltre oceano. Ottime le linguine alle vongole con cottura al dente e le tagliatelle con gamberi (pasta fatta in casa dallo chef). Abbiamo mangiato una pizza con granchio e mango davvero buona e Walter ci ha omaggiato di una pizza diavola che ho portato a casa per cena...mangiata fredda in hotel era davvero squisita. Buono anche il conto, spero di tornarci presto!< /text>< Name>

<name>megan martinez< /name><review>Order was correct but they charged me for someone else's order. A huge price difference too which is why I caught it. Bet they're overcharging to pocket money at the end of the day. This has happened to me before but not by much so I didn't bother going in for a refund. Foods good though.<//review>< date>

The cashier was wonderful, but the lobby service is terrible, I waited almost a half hour while I watched cars drive into the lot and through the drive thru while myself and others waited. People standing outside walked away because the line wasn't moving as it should've. Next time I'll go through the drive thru.<//Text>

It was really good. I ordered two original recipe chicken breasts and a BBQ crispy chicken sandwich. The breasts were huge and juicy! And the sandwich was really good and cooked perfect. The only thing wrong is it was a to go order, and I later found out that they forgot to give me a coleslaw and biscuit. Other than that, delicious!!</Text>

Spoke to "supervisor" Moses who said chicken was fresh! His idea of fresh and mine are two different definitions! Did not offer a substitution, refund or anything other than I have to drive back and pick up the receipt they didnt bother to give me. Sticking to Oxnard KFC. Food always fresh and delicious and have never had any problems there.<//Review>< response>

I mostly use the drive thru here and it is always very quick and easy. I have been inside a couple of times and it is well kept and has both a men's and women's restrooms. High chairs are available for children and it is family friendly. Prices are inexpensive and reasonable.<//text>

Homeless asleep inside establishment. The men's  restroom was being occupied by 2 male individuals that came out looking extremely agitated. So I did not allow my son to use the facilities. The staff was pleasant, food was served fast of course I took it to go.< /text>

< review>
April 30th 9pm I didn't appreciate how rude the manager was in the drivethu. Very impatient. Not courteous at all.  Nor was she professional at all. I let the other girl working the drive-thru drive-through know that the other girl was extremely rude and mean. We ordered additional potato wedges and had to park in the parking lot to wait for them which I don't mind because it just means that they will be hot and fresh but we also ordered a cinnamon roll desserts and when getting home found they were not in our bag so we had to go all the way back to get them. I don't understand how hard it is to take an order & put it in the bag. Pretty bumbed on the whole experience.</review>

<Text>Went through the drive thru. Person couldnt hear me and I couldnt hear him. Paid and was given no receipt. They forgot a small chicken sandwich i noticed when i got home. I call and the woman says the guy put it in with the kids meal. I tell her it is not in there. She tells me it is. Shaking my head. Never again with this place.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80e84e66464c97f7:0x19496b5cc6b188e4</Gmap_id><user_id>109013531602225597474<//user_id><Date>1543530618845</Date><user_name>Massiel Olivero< /user_name>< Pictures>

Disappointed that their Chicken Pot Pie DOES NOT have chunks of chicken, I mean, no chicken at all. Just veggies, potatoes and gravy. The heck?! Don't they have standardized recipes to stick to? Calling corporate office of KFC - one branch/franchisee deviating...

KFC on Saviers Road is the opposite. Their Chicken Pot Pies have chunks and chunks of chicken. Hence the name "CHICKEN POT PIE".

But overall since I fell in love with Popeyes I never looked back at KFC the same way again.</review>

Food is never hot. It’s been almost six months since I’ve rated here because of my last experience there, today the only thing that’s was hot was the biscuit so I guess they’ve improved...lol! But not really.</review>

Horrible Service!!!!!  I was told in the drive thru that my food was going to take 8 min to cook and to park out front.  After 15 minutes of waiting I went in the store and walked straight up to the counter.  I was completely ignored by 5 employees.  One girl was looking around me to outside for her ride to show up.  Another employee on his break just sat there.  I asked him if someone was going to help me.  He said someone should come up in a minute.  After waiting another 5 min I asked loudly if anyone was going to help me.  One very rude girl looks at me with a disgusted look and said you are waiting for your food right?  I said yes and was told it would be ready in a couple minutes very rudly.  I told them it would be nice to be acknowledged and was again just blown off.  Then when given my food no thank you, sorry, nothing.  Just another dirty look!  I will be making sure people know about the horrible customer service at this location.  Not to mention I was not given a receipt and an employee brought in a baby that was being held and passed around the back behind the counter.  Wow!!!< /text>

<text>No stars. I always gave an issue with this store with missing items or completely wrong order. Doesn't matter if I order inside or drive thru. Today, made an honest mistake and asked for red beans and rice. Cashier says in a rude tone, "ma'am, read the menu and sign. This is not Popeyes." Screw you guys, $15 an hour?

This locate was filthy inside! The floors appeared not to have been swept or mopped for quite some time. The customer in front of me was served chicken that was very dark in color. He asked for chicken that looked like that shown on the signage inside the store. He was told that it all comes out dark like that because they didn't have any fresh oil to cook in!

<review>We get it, California, you like sourdough. But sourdough croissants?? No. Literally everything here is sourdough. Every. Item. I am constantly on the search for fresh baked bread, but no options other than sourdough here, and always a long line.  Pizzas are pure oil. Chocolate Chip cookies are decent.</review><rating>2</rating><time>1621616858255</time><Gmap_id>0x808f874190045807:0x2eeb5a2233b2e795</Gmap_id>< name>

Arizmendi Bakery has been one of my favorite bakeries to frequent since living in Oakland. It is a cooperative business—anotherwords, run by the people that work there.

They are very Covid minded. You line up outside the store front. You can look into the storefront window to see what pastries are available. When you get to the head of the line there is a list on the door telling you what pizza and soup is available for the day. The cookies were bundled together for easier buying.

There were 2 people working the front of the store—one taking the order and money, and the other person getting it and bagging for you.

Their baked goods are fresh and delicious! I have always scarfed down their vegetarien soup and pizza with gusto. Their prices are reasonable.

They look like they are succussful during the pandemic, and I am happy to see that. There are many businesses very close by that haven't been able to make it.</Text>

Always busy. Favorite bakery in Oakland. Favorites include: daily Vegetarian pizza, special cheese roll, cinnamon roll with frosting, cinnamon and sugar morning bun, currant scone, peanut butter cookie, blueberry muffin… you really can’t go wrong here!

Tight space, so tables and chairs are always in demand. Fortunately you can always sit by the lake if you can’t find a seat at the cafe. I recommend parking by Trader Joe's where there's 2 hour free parking, because parking is hard to come by.<//text>

<review>It was a quick and organized pizza retrieval pandemic was. Expensive pies... Not anything to write home about as far as flavor bursting. The crust was pretty good but it was so greasy I just held it out over the ground and watched it drip for a while before I ate it. If you're a fan. You'll love it.</review><Name>Cee Rose< /Name></record>

I noticed today that Arizmendi is starting to sell day old or defrosted muffins without advising customers. I bought a blueberry muffin today at 11:am and it was stale and cold, obviously not made today. If this continues, I'll be going elsewhere.<//text>

If you are living you haven't lived till you ate here. I have no clue what I was doing, I got in line and said today we eat something different. Although, initially the line had me feeling like it may not be worth it let me tell you, I regret saying that. I didn't know what to get so I went with the pizza of the day. It was like a slice of heaven put on a golden platter made for the gods! I felt like this is what the pantheon of gods eat! Its delicious!!! I also purchased the soup of the day and I felt like it was a mouth watering journey to another galaxy that had me wishing I could stay on that planet forever. And top it of at the end, I got me some cookies. The customer service was excellent and I told her, I want a cookie thats gonna take my on a bumpy journey and it didn't disappoint. I got the cowgirl cookies and she threw one extra for free. I felt like I was reborn with every slice of pizza bite, mouth watering soup and stupidness cookies! If you come to Oakland, and don't do anything, and want to discover the meaning of life or gain a new perspective, come here grab a bite and watch your world shift.</text>

Good food but things are different due to the pandemic. Good pizza! Keep the crust thin, it's getting a bit thick! The light bake is great, when you get home its fresh! Keep it tight and clean and find a way to keep the flies out or controlled, not a good look and it's not sanitary.< /Review>

The pizza. Is. Delicious. Not only is the crust thin and crunchy, but the flavors combine in a way that leaves nothing overpowered— I hate pizzas that make the ingredients compete! Service was nice, there’s barely any seating so plan to eat standing or head to the park if you’re visiting on a busy day. I’d totally recommend this place :)< /text>

My gosh. DELICIOUS! To my understanding the pizza changes daily, but when it’s as good as the pie I had how could you go wrong?! A bit of a line, but totally worth the wait.< /Text>

Updating my review to include pics from their remodel in early Jan 2019.  Nice clean bright space now, still open kitchen, still not enough seating given the usual constant crowds.  Food comments are still valid - love that's it's all organic and the business is employees owned. Awesome pizza, crispy yet chewy crust, and the almond snail bun and frosted cinnamon bun are my fav here. However, foccacia is too dense/hard, and scones aren't sweet enough, and aren't crumbly buttery enough :(< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>It'was the eve before Christmas when this unreal slice snuck up on us. Had a gang of goodies from here but none better than this spinach and tomato slice. Holy New Haven, this slice, which was deceivingly full of flavour, might be the One on the West Coast. The tomato and spinach tastes super fresh, and the dough has a nice garlic and herb flavour as well.< /Review>< pics>

Love love love. Every Sunday, you can find me in line at 10am for the breakfast pizza and iced coffee (pizza of the day + egg custard + hash browns, 10-11am on Sundays only); work-from-home Fridays, I get the chocolate raspberry scone. Lake Merritt picnic days, I’m bringing pizza!!</Text>

I love this beloved institution. They make delicious, artisanal baked goods and are a model for running a successful worker owned co-op.< /Review>

<Review>Arizmendi is a democratically run, worker-owned cooperative, which in itself is super cool! All the workers share in the profits. They make good money!

But you may be more interested in knowing that they sell absolutely delicious pizza, bread, pastries, and soups. Everything is as good as it gets. They have a long history of excellence and are not slowing down one bit!

You may also be interested in knowing that, because the workers don't need tips, but people are used to tipping, they keep a "tip jar" by the register and donate the money that comes in to a local non-profit. The non-profit changes monthly. You can always find information about the current beneficiary of the tip jar money by reading the walls.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>If you stop here, be sure to try the thin crust pizza! Baked goods are also delicious and everything is reasonably priced.

Accepts debit/credit if over $5.

No WiFi and not an abundance seating - so it's not a "sit and work" place but more of a "grab a quick, delicious bite" place.</Review>< user_id>

I've never been dissapointed coming here!  If you love a good crusty sourdough like me, then you must try Arizmendi! I'll confess it's not the best SD loaf I've had but pretty close to it and only because the Bay Area has too many choices which make the SD competition stiff here. They do, however, make the best heavenly sourdough pizza on earth and offer a delicious daily vegetarian soup that will leave you with a very difficult choice to make.

As for the baked goodies, the almond flour brownie is the best brownie I've ever had and it's gluten free!?! But don't let that keep you from trying it...I couldn't't believe I actually found a GF item I like. Even my kids approve!  Unfortunately, the Lakeshore location is the only one selling it but don't worry any pastry at Arizmendi is great. Croissants are flaky and buttery, cookies are chewy and fresh... You can't go wrong with Arizmendi on any given day.</text>

Legit bakery with pizza. I got the pizza of the day aka the only pizza, some cookies and a pastry. All were great overall. The pizza slices are a little small, but I wasn't disappointed as the ingredients were tasty and balanced. The cookies and pastry were amazing. Good vibes/cool staff.<//text>

< review>
Varied and delicious selection of cookies, scones, cinnamon roll-type things, muffins, rolls (savory and sweet), and loaves of bread. I especially enjoyed their cheese scone... very crumbly yet moist with all the right savory tones without being too salty. The area to grab bakes goods can get a little cramped with very few people, so it's ideal to nab what you want as quickly as you can! The sweet baguette is nice, but best fresh. The crispy skin can get soft within a few hours, but while it is crisp, it is extra good! (Also they had quite a few gluten-free options for various products!)

There is a fridge full of various salad options (both leafy and other e.g. bean salad), cold soup (I think only 1 kind), and a small selection of cheese. Excellent for a quick baguette + cheese snack or picnic meal.

Lots of drinks available on their menu and decent amount of indoor seating. The entryway can get cramped with the line (it's a busy place!) so come ready with some "excuse me" and "pardon me"s to squeeze past other patrons.

See the photo: 10% discount for 60+ y.o. with bike helmets!<//review>

I wholeheartedly recommend this location for any occasion. It’s truly for everybody and the staff are always professional and kind. There’s a seat for everyone and it shows . All in all, the baked items are crafted with rich ingredients, skills, and love.<//Review>

Amazing food and people. Almost always busy- they do order ahead for big holidays which is nice. Things can be a bit pricey but it's well worth it for the quality and to back the worker owned co-op.<//Text>

It's always a pleasant experience for me to see the familiar faces of the locals enjoying this really cool indoor/outdoor eatery. I visit weekly and purchase 2 slices of pizza. They mix-n-match flavorful produce and cheese and bake it on this awesome pizza crust. I don't know what they put on the crust but it is so delicious. It's a little crispy on the edges just the way I like my thin crust.  There's a line during the lunch hour but the employees have a system and they get you served in no time.  It's pretty cool to be able to chill and peep out the locals while you wait. You are bound to meet some pretty awesome people in line. I always do.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Great pizza and cozy seating. The bathroom is located down a hall but there is a sink right next to the pickup window. Baked goods are unique and range from baguette to foccocia and sourdough chocolate croissant. This place almost always has a short line. There's a communal table that has benches and can make for interesting conversation.< /Review>

<Review>Great employee owned bakery. The pizza changes up daily and is almost always a good bet, expect to see unusual toppings like cauliflower and zucchini. The cookies are phenomenal and I usually wind up buying way too many.
They do run odd hours so make sure you check before you go!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

OMG!  The breads and pastries are a dream. I enjoy the cheese rolls they give me a feeling of nostalgia. I can go in with a few dollars and my mind with just one bite is swept away to olden times. Trust me my mind needs breaks in reality to the times when life was good and not so cluttered. The atmosphere is busy but at the same time it has a laid back type of vibe. Staff is great and busy keeping the line moving.  Stop by if you have the time it's worth it.< /Text>

I've always enjoyed the unique and savory breads and pastries from here. They're baked fresh everyday, so it's best to get your product early. However, it's still tasty with reheating.</Review>

<Text>You gotta love a local co-op (read: worker owned & operated for you non-socialist types) bakery just for the sake of that. But it's successful and it's because it's efficient (even at busy times, the lines moves fast), reliable (whichever of your fav from a wide assortment of pastries, baked goods and breads are almost always available), generally woke (vegan options incl Butcher's Son cheese on vegan pizza) and you can find something for many occasions (breakfast, lunch or bring-something-to-the-party). The coffee is just fine and they got an espresso bar for the fancy types though please skip the "double pump of vanilla syrup BS".<//Text>< Pics>

I'm always happy with the quality of the food here. I often buy pizza, fresh baked bread and cherry corn scones-all delicious! I think they need to make logistical adjustments since their recent remodel. There's less room for browsing the cases and there are often people with strollers inside, blocking a large part of the available space. Maybe they had a plan, but it's not working yet.</Text>

Great pizza and pastries. The chocolate raspberry scone was one of the best I have had in a while. Love the little extra slice you get with your pizza. 5 Stars.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>this place is amazing ...all the people who work here are owners it's run as a cooperative which makes it a real pleasure to shop here. but also the products are uniformly excellent ... my favorites include the special daily cheese roll, (they make a regular asiago cheese roll every day that's delicious, and then there is a special cheese roll which changes daily and has things like onion or brocolini or feta) the Rosemary walnut bread, the English muffin and the pizza. They just remodeled the interior there's nice sitting inside and also the three or four tables outside are  perfect for sitting with your food and people watching<//Text>< Pictures>

I think they have changed the pizzas a bit. Still quite good, but much thinner crust now after the redesign. Interior design is much improved.</Review>

Great pastries and pizza. There's only one "flavor" pizza a day, so make sure you call ahead to see what it is, or you can just gamble, but whatever you decide to do, you can bet that it will satisfy your stomach. Co-op owned and just a good group of people.<//Text>

Excellent baked goods, coffee, and it's a co-op. The employees are owners. This is democracy in practice. More businesses should run under this model.</review>

One of my favorite bakeries. They just did a big renovation and added some seating for eating there, but also a good quick place for take out. They have one pizza a day and one soup a day. They also have a range of breads, cookies, scones, muffins, and rolls every day.</Review>

<text>Coop owned coffee and pizza, don't get disheartened with the line, since they only serve one style 🍕 everyday they are crazy efficient at serving it. Coffee, cakes and pastry are also on the menu and very good also. I am a fan of coops, allows people with talent and little capital launch great projects.</text>< Pictures>

Great bakery with fresh breads (cheese breads, morning buns, etc).  No meat in the store.  They make one type of veggie pizza each day that has never disappointed, and i generally never eat veggie pizzas.  For sure stop by and grab a slice!<//text>

I love shopping here because they are a co-op, but also because the bread is so damned good and priced so reasonably. At breakfast they have egg focaccia, muffins, sweet rolls. They have premade salads and sandwiches for lunch, as well as pizza by the slice that never disappoints. This is why there is almost always a small line out the door, but worth the short wait.</Text>

Good to great pizza depending on the pizza toppings of the day.  Some pastries are very good, some are okay. Personal preference of course. Fast, friendly service. Drip coffee is cheap and $.50 for refills. No tips requested using credit card! Haha< /Text>

They pass the good baguette test ... and this is from late in the day Baguettes I got at Mandela food coop. They are original good! I think there’s something where capitalists and libertarians are incapable of making great affordable bread because it goes against their personal beliefs, and the worker coops are the only ones who will save us. Most of the bread section of any major grocery store should just go in the incinerator this is the only stuff worth actually eating sometimes. The only bad thing is that I had to practice self control so I wouldn’t eat the whole thing In one session it was so good</review>

I love the suburban bread for daily, can’t beat the muffins and scones, the wheat free brownies are amazing. Veg soup is a tasty, frugal lunch served with a nice hunk of fresh bread. I’ll be totally frank, 9 times out of 10 the soup is delicious. Definitely a strange soup day on a rare 1/10 occasion! I love Arizmendi lakeshore! Each location is delicious, and I think that the lively atmosphere in the heart of Oakland makes lakeshore Arizmendi really special.</Text>< Pictures>

Lovely co-op with great pizza and other baked goods. I don't know anyone that doesn't like the pizza. Get there early in the morning and get the previous day's pizza half off. Coffee is good. I moved away, but the special cheese roll and cinnamon bun with frosting are recommended.< /text>

Arizmendi has been a favorite spot of mine since 1998 when I landed in Oakland.  My son and I were so impressed and excited by the new renovations that they just completed!  Bravo Arizmendi!  Here's to decades more of great baked goods by good people supporting our community.< /Review>

Check out the beautifully remodeled location! More seating area, better traffic flow between the cash registers and pick up counter. Last, but not least, access to a restroom!<//text>

<Text>One of my favorite cheap eats! Co-op owned/run bakery, with great breakfast pastries, breads, cookies, and a pizza,  soup, and salad of the day. One never knows what the soup,  pizza, and salad flavors will be,  but they are always great! Everything is made with mostly organic ingredients, and is vegetarian. They also offer loose leaf teas, coffee, espresso drinks, and iced coffee and tea. It is a very popular spot, so there are long lines, but it's worth it!!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Amazing pizza! It's only one kind each day though, so if you don't like the kind they are serving, you're out of luck for the day. Personally, I've never had a pizza I didn't like here though. The crust is made from corn, which is really good, and all their ingredients are locally sourced from their own gardens. They have a wide selection of baked goods and breads as well, which are really good!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>As with Cheeseboard, I love the pizza here at Arizmendi. They serve only one pizza special (vegetarian) each day. As with tradition, the ingredients are fresh and the cheeses are delicious! They also always throw in a few extra small slices, which us perfect because if you're picking up pizza, no one will know you had a quick taste. The breads and pastries are also really good. I really like their chocolate almond scone, which seems to be really popular.< /review>< GmapID>

One of my favourite bakeries in the East Bay!  I usually make the exit to load up on sweet and savory baked goods prior to the long haul home to Los Angeles.

I've been a regular customer over the past 15 years and I haven't been disappointed.  It is a co-op bakery that is self-service.  All items contain no artificial flavours/ingredients and taste excellent fresh or reheated in the oven.</text>

One of my favorite pizza places in the bay. Only one type of pizza per day, always vegetarian, and no tomato sauce. Flavors are always on point and I never miss having meat. You can even get a pizza lightly baked so you can finish baking it at home. There is also a wide assortment of baked goods that look delicious. Highly recommended spot.</Review>

Always a treat to partake in arizmendi's baked goods. Favorite than is probably their chocolate things, but really anything you try will be delicious. This store and most other locations are always busy. Their a few tables inside and outside, but no bathroom. Their also a worker owned business so that's cool too.</text>

Try the oatmeal chocolate cookies, fruit muffins, corn bread, Grackle, Suburban English muffin and special cheese roll.< /Text><GmapID>0x808f874190045807:0x2eeb5a2233b2e795< /GmapID>< time>

<text>I go virtually every day, to get one of the several kinds of cheese breads that they bake throughout the week, or to get whatever unique pizza they've made that day. The people that serve you are a joy to be around; they even are willing to put up with being called the wrong name for a year!  How much more hospitable can they be?  It's one of my favorite places!</text><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< name>

< Review>
AMAZING PIZZA. All vegetarian and it's so good I bring my non-vegetarian friends here and even they're blown away.

They serve one type of pizza daily, different each day. I don't bother with looking at the menu because I have never once been disappointed by what they serve. You can by the slice, half a pizza, or a whole pizza.

Also, they have a great selection of baked goods, salads, granola, and always a daily soup. There's often a selection of vegan baked goods in addition to non-vegan options.<//Review>

A couple days after moving to Oakland from New Haven CT, the nation's pizza capital, I stopped in to see what all the fuss was about. The toppings on my goat cheese pizza with sun dried tomatoes were fresher and tastier than anything I could get back home. The crust was reminiscent of a fine baguette, fluffy and light with loads of flavor. Will definitely make this a regular spot.<//review>

Unassuming "bakery" that offers once per day amazing pizzas. Came here with my wife by referral and were told we had to try the pizza. The daily offering was just a simple cheese pizza but it was AMAZING. The flavors were a buttery savory blend and the bread was some of the highest quality I've seen on a pizza. I would say this was in my top 5 favorite pizzas of all time. Will definitely be coming here again to show friends/family.<//Review>

<Review>If you like cheese and you like pizza, definitely come check this place out. If you’ve ever been to Cheeseboard in Berkeley, it’s the same concept. They only make one type of (vegetarian) pizza a day (toppings change) and you an order a whole or half pizza. I forgot what toppings I had on my pizza that day, but I remembered it was delicious! It’s something about the cheese they put on the pizza that makes it amazing! YUM! They also have other pastries and stuff. I got a cheese roll and a chocolate pecan cookie and they were both delicious as well.

Overall, I’m totally a fan and would probably eat this every week if I lived closer.< /Review>< Time>

Had a cherry tomato, drizzled with basil pesto, simply outstanding!!!! Slices took a few minutes to come out, but its a good measure of how freshly made pizza is.  Would definitely come again.
Maybe more seating availability would improve experience.<//Text>

I crave Arizmendi's pizza on a daily basis! I recently moved to the East Coast for work, but whenever I go home my parent know to greet me with an Arizmendi pizza, it is my absolute favorite. Even though the lines are always long, their service is always great and quick, you can't really beat that.<//Text>

<username>Coby Ben-Poorat</username><review>Love this co-op bakery that also makes some of the best sourdough crust pizza in town (one "flavor" per day) along with a soup of the day and some salads.  I go there for the pizza more than their baked goods, but those are phenomenal too!</review>< Pictures>

This was my first visit to this location in a while, but the product sold is top notch and the service kind. A number of customers walked in just before closing - no issues from the staff who were completely pleasant and accommodating, but I'm sure were also ready to lock the door and go home.</text>

<text>The pizzas are great,even though a little dominated by goat cheese. The rolls and pastries are excellent and have very imaginative ingredients.  But the baguettes....they are jaw breakers. Maybe they use the same dough as used in the pizzas? If you have ever had a  baguette in France, you won't recognize these bricks.
There are so many outstanding bread varieties available,in Europe,  in bakeries that bake every day. Arizmendi does not  have to reinvent the wheel and could greatly improve its sales; just by emulating those bakeries  🍞</text>< pictures>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Some seriously good baked goods here. The scones were awesome, and the variety of other things we tried were also very good. Though the place looks like a commercial bakery where they plopped down a register, some shelves and a coffee station when you first walk in, the place is legit. A few more table would be the only quibble from me.</review>< Resp>

Delicious vegetarian only pizza. Comparable to Sliver and Cheeseboard in Berkeley but different in that the pizzas are drastically different every day, whereas Sliver and Cheeseboard kind of has a specific clintro-y taste.</Text>

<Text>Vegetarian with some vegan items, good but not outstanding. Ambiance there is pedestrian, loud and chaotic; difficult to find table/ seating or ascertain where the line starts. Pizza is whatever they happen to be making that day. Can be a wait if your timing is out of sync with their baking cycle.<//Text>< pics>

Of the three Arizmendi Bakeries I’ve been to (here, Sunset, and Mission) - this was the most well-stocked and friendliest.  Lots of different pastries available - I picked up the cookie brittle, chocolate chip cookie, and a scone. Woman at the counter was efficient and friendly.</Text>

Incredibly good pizza. They have a different single pizza offered daily, & each is great. The wait in line is short. You can buy one or more slices. There is also a daily soup & a daily selection of breads & baked items. You can purchase bottled drinks. This is a coop & they have several affiliates. Parking can be challenging.</review>

I absolutely love their pizza. It's vegan pizza, they have 1 choice of pizza everyday, and it's always delicious.  I come here very often because of the pizza, I can't get enough.<//Text>

For some reason they put onions on every single pizza. Aside from that, it's amazing. Simple concept, employee owned, and some of the best pizza in the Bay Area. Love it!< /Review>

<Text>This pizza is DELICIOUS.  You can call (or with some locations, check online) to find out what the pizza of the day is.  They only make one kind each day, but in my experience they are all amazing.  I would suggest bringing a friend or a few and going for the half or whole pizza (yeah, you can just order half a pizza!)  Service is fast, people are nice, and you support a coop!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>The pizza here is phenomenal. It changes every day, but no matter what it's always amazing! I've probably had pizza here around 30 times, and it's awesome. You can buy a slice, half a pizza, or even a whole pizza already baked! Or even not-baked if you want to bake it yourself at home.  They have great bread too, just prepared to be patient since this place is always packed.</review></record>

This Arizmendi location takes me back to when I lived in Oakland. Walking Lake Merritt, weekend Farmers Market and early morning Arizmendi coffee & fresh baked breads. This brings a smile to my face.</text>

<UserId.>115701124972138757010< /UserId.><Review>I don't eat the breads, I've never had their coffee, and I don't really like vegan soups.

I come for the pizza. Every day, it's a different thing, and I have never been saddened.

It's like a taste apocalypse. Good Vibrations is right nearby but I'll swear that I've always found more pleasure at Arizmendi with two slices of their Pizza of the Day.

Day treating you bad? Life got you down? Boyfriend can't get you off? Arizmendi. Get a half pizza, call me, and we'll split it.

P.S. 10% discount to those of you who bike, and wear a helmet.< /Review>< rating>

<Text>Come for the cheese rolls, stay for the cinnamon rolls, pizza, soup or cowgirl cookies!
Everything made here by hand, worker owned with added ingredient TLC.
Near trader Joe's, CVS, parking, lake Merritt, it's ideally located for a breakfast and stroll.
It gets crowded so keep an eye out for seating or grab and go.</Text>< Pics>

Great place to grab well priced loaf of bread baked that day or enjoy their slice of the day pizza. Their bread's become my first choice option of the bay area.</Text>

<text>I've lived in the bay area for quite some time now and I'm ashamed to say I've never been here.  You will walk in and instantly be overwhelmed with sights and smells.  It smells amazing, it smells like baked goods and coffee.  The 2 best things in life.  I went during the lunch rush hour and that's probably why I was so overwhelmed.

When you walk in, to the left, there's a wall full of amazing baked goods such as cookies, loaves of bread, focaccia bread, scones, muffins, brownies, and so much more.  Any delicious carb you can think of, they have it here.  They even have a bread schedule, on certain days they bake certain breads.  There was sooooo much I wanted to try.  For times sake I grabbed a cookie that had chocolate chips, coconut, oatmeal and some other amazing things.  I also got a slice of the pizza of the day.  They only offer one kind of pizza per day, by the slice or you can buy an entire pie.  When I went they were serving an Indian pizza with Masala sauce and cilantro! Soooooooooo delicious.

It is sweet/savory heaven here.  They offer a variety of teas and coffees as well.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other baked goods.  I hear the granola is the best in town.  Pricing isn't bad, service is good, and just a bit hectic and chaotic inside.  That's just means it's good right?<//text>< Pics>

My favorite bakery. Amazing sourdoughs. Much of their lineup is based on thier different sourdoughs and focaccia. Pizzas are amazing - one of the best I've had I'm my lifetime. All is amazing: focaccia, wolverine rolls, zampanos, croissants, baguettes. Everything is incredible. Fantastic business as well, they truly serve the community.< /Text>

I love savory baked goods more than sweets, and Arizmendi delivers. Their cheese rolls are sharp, chewy, satisfying. Zampanos are lightly brushed with olive oil, dusted with cheese and sprinkled with red pepper flakes. Pizzas are outstanding and worth buying by the slice or the pie for at-home baking.< /Text>

My family swears by their scones, especially the currant ones, but I think their mocha shortbread is probably the yummiest thing in the case.

M got their frosted cinnamon roll and liked that it wasn't too sweet.< /Review>

Great selection of well-made breads and pastries. The pizza is quite good, but not the style I prefer - so no review of that.</Text>

This is our #1 "go to" solution whenever we want pizza. Phenomenal pizza -- each one is vegetarian and will significantly expand your ideas as to what can go on a pizza. Haven't had a bad one, yet.  Always serve their pizza when we have visitors from out of state just to confirm their sterotyoes as to what "crazy Californians" might be eating.<//review>

If you live in the Bay Area and have not had the pleasure of tasting the freshly made Artisan breads, pastries or their pizza, you must resolve to treat yourself!  They make a different pizza every day, but they only make one kind per day....you will never be disappointed.< /Text>

After four years of wanting to support this worker owned cooperative, I've thrown in the towel.
The customer service area is poorly laid out requiring one to stand in up to three different lines for one sitting.
Some bakery items are prepared inconsistently, items with crusts are often baked too hard to enjoy, as one reviewer noted of the baguettes. Soft baked goods like focaccio are usually good though.
Self service coffee urns often run out with no standby urns brewing, meaning long waits for an item that has already been paid for. (the irony of being offered a senior discount and a bicycle helmet wearer's discount on a purchase where the product was not delivered is not lost upon me).
The daily pizza is quite good. They have a new ingredient combination each day, meaning a fresh, hot delicious surprise everytime I come in.  Trouble is that my order gets dropped too often, somewhere between the cashier and the person preparing and serving the slices, one who works six feet away from the other.
The last time I was in (the very last time) I concluded that if I wanted food service like this, I should re-enlist in the Navy.<//text>

This place has Jedi mind-trick pizza.  Don't think you like fennel?  You will on their pizza.  Don't like artichoke hearts?  You will on their pizza.  Anytime I've initially been disappointed at their toppings of the day, I end up still loving their pizza.  How do you do it, Arizmendi?  HOW DO YOU DO IT???< /text>

Amazing pizza, friendly staff, sometimes you get two slivers instead of one!

Come here if you're a fan of the cheeseboard collective, you won't be disappointed.< /review>

<Review>so, i was finally able to try this place since i am no longer juice cleansing...wanted to get a slice and share a salad with a friend...but they were out of salad. bummer, right? WRONG! the pizza was SO good. every day they have inventive and delicious pizza made on an amazing crust! can't wait to go back and try the bread.

it's definitely geared for more of a take-out feel (as they only have a few tables) but i can't wait to try one of their half-baked pizzas to take home and finish in the over so it's still fresh and tastes right out of the oven!

this will definitely be a staple in our weekly routine for bread...and why not be able to get an amazing slice while there?</Review>< pics>

<Text>I go out if my way to go to arizmendi's! love love love! daily pizza specials are a must. the banana nut loaf is the best I've ever had. but...it's only on saturdays so get their early since it often sells out by the days end. and the to-die-for cheese rolls. OMG. they stuff it with different veggies & cheeses. very creative and sooooo good.< /Text></record>

Go to the one in emeryville. They have better parking, customer service, better pizza and more options for other bakery items. I love arizmendi and decided to check out the Oakland one. Bad bad idea lol!<//review>

<review>Yes, look, this *IS* it.
A thing of rare beauty. (Mostly).
The kind of place that you would sorely miss, if you moved away.</review>< username>

< Review>
I've been going to this place since high school--amazing pizzas, delicious pastries. The saddest time was taking a friend here when they were remodeling and closed.

This is the place that has locals coming back time and time again--it's on the list of nearly everyone who've moved to other places and have a bucket list each time they visit.

Favorites: Chocolate Thing, Olive Focaccia, Cheese Rolls, Corn Cherry Scone, Corn Muffins, Pizza--anykind.
Good to know: the baguettes are not your typical french baguette--they are hearty, sourdough with a substantial crust, so be ready.

There's often a line but it'll move fast. And they take credit card so all the easier to carry away a big box of pastries.</Review>

Great home-made style pastries and decent coffee for moderate prices - often gets too crowded on weekends though, and parking in that neighborhood is generally impossible.</Review>

<Review>When you ask me what bakery to go to and Arizmendi immediately comes to mind - then you know it is the place to be. I've seen this place grow over the years... waaaaay back since the late 90s - I think with the founders of this location. Favorites: Brioche knot, Ginger stout cake, blueberry swirls, cinnamon rolls, Macaroons, Ricarellis, Asiago bread and their various vegetarian pizzas - always different everyday. Not a fan of starch on starch pizzas though. Someday I hope they'll expand their selection to include GF and DF options - then they would be unstoppable!</Review>< Pictures>
