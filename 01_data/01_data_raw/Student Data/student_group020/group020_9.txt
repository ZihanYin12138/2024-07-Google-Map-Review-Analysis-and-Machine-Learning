< review>
Hannibal's Catering & Events has been catering lunches and dinners for my company for months now. Every day the staff is friendly and efficient. They have expressed outstanding service with exceptional cleanliness in regard to the current pandemic. Taylor is always shinning with her bubbly personality and over-the-top customer service. Every staff member is friendly and they don't mind a bit of banter while serving us. Although meals are contracted through work they never fail to remember my dietary needs and shield my plate from meat and dairy while offering amazing vegan options! 10 out of 10 I would recommend to a friend!< /review>

I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to try out Hannibal's while I was activated for my job here in Rancho Cordova. While I was here, I had the pleasure of meeting Taylor, and I also had the opportunity to try out their chicken curry, which was absolutely amazing. I love Indian food, and I am a very very strict critic of what is and isn't good when it comes Indian food, and I can say this is above reproach. I urge you to try out their chicken curry, and if you ever get the opportunity to see or meet Taylor, you'll be as well off as I am. Thank you again Hannibal's, it was a wonderful experience.< /Text>

Catherine was awesome, she helped us plan the menu for our company party and was on top of everything. Anytime we had any questions or changes she was quick to respond and accommodated all our needs. Olga, was the onsite person we met and she was professional, friendly, and incredibly helpful as well. The food had everyone talking and was extremely well executed. We have many people in our company with gluten allergies and other dietary needs. Highly recommend the Sicilian Prosciutto Chicken, Seasonal Vegetables and Polenta Lasagna, Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Vegetables with Mushroom, Peppers, and Winter Squash, and the Broccoli Apple & Almond Salad. All crowd favorites and will not disappoint!
Hannibal's did a wonderful job overall and we would love to work with them again for future events.< /text>

I used Hannibal's to provide food for a funeral reception in a private home. They did an excellent job in setting up, managing the guests' needs, and cleaning up - freeing up the family to experience this important day.  The food was great, especially the broccoli salad.<//review>

I can't begin to say enough about everyone at Hannibal's. From the initial phone call, thru the consultation and, of course the folks that actually came and put it together.  Only one word to describe it..... AMAZING.  Easiest party I have ever had.  As half of the 90 guests were vegetarian, I was very nervous about food choices, but needlessly.  I was told it was the best vegetarian food ever served at a party.  Great job Hannibal.  Oh, and if you use Hannibal, definitely, definitely go for the decor package.  Everything was beautiful and I can't thank all of you enough.  If you ever think about opening a satellite location on the east coast, please let me know.  I'll be your first customer.<//Text>< name>

We used Hannibal's catering & events as our caterer for our wedding reception. We are very thankful to all staffs of Hannibal’s Catering & Events for the great job of timing everything out and blended into the crowd of more than 200. Indeed they are a team of professional. The food was served hot and the exquisite food styling with garnishes was really amazing. Guests at the wedding commented on how it was the best wedding food they had ever had and the portions were more then expected. The appetizers, salad, bread and main meals were all delicious. We are so happy that Phil's and his staff helped to make our special day such a memorable one</text>

Hannibal's catered our office Holiday Party in December 2014 and it was wonderful.  The amount of meat, potatoes, and side vegetable was more than our 60+ employees could eat.  We would definitely use them again for another big gathering.

The only suggestion I have for anyone ordering for a big group is to ask for extra salads, we inly got one bowl of green salad and one bowl of fruit salad and it ran out so not everyone got salad.<//Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Absolute worst experience of my life. If you don't have a large event don't go with them. We had an 80 guest wedding and this wasn't a large account to them.
My email to our coordinator after the event is below. The company essentially called me a liar in their response and accepted no responsibility for the issues. I contacted them several times throughout the process with no response due to my coordinator having a medical issue. When my fiance finally called all they did was send an invoice without any of the information I requested.
I would advise you to seek another company if you want a smooth event on a lower budget- if your not forking out  10,000 they could care less.

I wanted to take a moment to share with you the experience we had with Hannibal's catering for our wedding this Saturday. We choose Hannibal's for the reputation and reviews, and we couldn't have had a worse experience. I understand you had a medical emergency that caused you to be out before our wedding. However, The company signed into a contract with us to provide a service for a wedding we did not receive. I am writing to explain to you the numerous issues that arose, and provide you with the opportunity to remedy the situation before further action is taken.

Timeline-
The caterers arrived at 4:30pm. Due to their tardiness, the appetizers were not set up until 45 minutes into our cocktail hour.. On top of that.. They were served ICE COLD, both the mini sliders and coconut shrimp skewers were not heated in any manner before being served to our guests.

"Bartender"-
We signed into a contract with Hannibal's to provide a bartender for the event. The employee you sent not only was not a bartender- she felt the need to tell every single guest that she was not a bartender and had never bar-tended before. She complained to all my guests, and told myself and my husband she wasn't a bartender. We had prepared mixed cocktails in advance so she only had to pour them and add the garnishments. She did not put a single garnishment on any drink even after being directed to do so multiple times. We purchased and prepared all the garnishments with our own money on our own time. Her negative attitude was a horrific experience for myself as the bride as I had multiple guests come up to me asking where she was from and why she didn't want to be there so badly.  My guests ended up making their own drinks to avoid her because she was rude to everyone.
Dinner-
I had emailed in advance asking what decorations we would need to provide for the dinner presentation and was told not to worry that was all part of the contract. There was absolutely no presentation. The food was all served in plain black trays with one flower arrangement on the table that didn't even match our color scheme. We would have provided our own setup if it would have been articulated that you guys were not going to put in any effort in arranging an attractive presentation for a wedding.  On top of all these issues, no where in the contract did it state the servers would take all the additional food. We had guests staying the night and a refrigerated area to store the food and the leftovers were taken without our consent.
Dessert-
Fortunately we had planned our own platters and decor for dessert which helped as there was no plan by your company to provide decor or presentation for this. The servers complained that we asked for the desserts to be put on our platters. We also ordered the 4 variety option and didn't receive the Russian tea cookies- which wasn't a huge deal for us but it was never communicated to us that all options would not be provided.< /review>< pics>

I'm currently in Sacramento for a week for work. This company is catering our lunches. While the food is tasty, the ability to have a healthy meal is taken away when their cucumber salad is coated in oil or mashed potatoes are overly mixed with butter. Unfortunately, as someone who signed up for the conference, I didn't have the ability to make suggestions or recommendations for meals.< /Review>

Everything was perfect and we were extremely impressed with how professional you all were. All our guests commented on how fantastic the food was.

I couldn't have been happier with how easy it was to navigate your site,
order and received a follow up call regarding the order. I was sooo
impressed with the server that came. He was truly a ninja that would swoop
in as soon as someone was done eating and take the garbage and we were
spread all over the house in different rooms. I swear you have gps and

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Hannibal's Catering & events went above and beyond our  expectations . Their  varities  of wedding menu packages made it so easy for us to choose. We were pleased with the tasting but the day of our wedding the food was even more wonderful, delicious, fresh and plentiful. Everything was set up to perfection and the staff was courteous and dressed so nicely! With Hannibals  catering & events you don't have to worry about details...they just seem to have a 'sixth sense' for what is needed and take care of everything... It was a such a pleasure to work with Phil and his staff--they take great pride in their services and it was very evident on our special day - our wedding. They are worth every penny you spend!<//review>< UserId.>

<Review>From menu selection (I love the "Bargain Lunches" selections for variety/affordability/portion size), to online ordering (site is easy to navigate), even setting up date of delivery is a no brainer (calendar tells you if date you choose is available). The entire process is simple, the delivery staff is professional/friendly/accommodating, Set-up and clean-up is a breeze.  As the Hospitality person, Hannibal's makes my job so easy.  Lately, I have had requests to include Vegan portions, and those selections have been appealing/delicious (Polenta/roasted veg. lasagna) can be "added on to an existing order".  They even have an "online rewards program" that accumulates points coupons on future orders. Thank you Hannibal's.  Keep up the good work.< /Review><Name>Becky Sheldon</Name>< gmap_id>

<review>Our daughter's wedding reception was such a success and memorable one!!
All credit should goes to Hannibals Catering & Events.
Our menu tasting was a great experience, the staff were all extremely professional through the whole process.  The sit down dinner was fanastic! The setting was such a glamour which any bride will wish. My daughter is so happy with it. Our guests are still talking about it and how good and delicious the food was.I will recommend Hannibal's catering & events to all my friends and family!!!

< Review>
The bronze Mechanics Monument was created by sculptor Douglas Tilden and dedicated in 1901.

Tilden was born in Chico, California, in 1860. At age four, he contracted scarlet fever which left him deaf and mute for life.

Tilden attended the California School for the Deaf and UC Berkeley, then he studied art in Paris.

The Mechanics Monument was commissioned to honor industrialist Peter Donahue, founder of the San Francisco & North Pacific Railroad.

The bronze depicts five men struggling to punch a hole through a metal plate with a punch press. At the base are symbols of Donahue's professions: an anvil represents foundries, a propeller represents shipping, and the driving wheel and connecting rod represent railroads.

When the monument was dedicated, many citizens were shocked by the sight of rude mechanicals cavorting in the street without their knickers. Editorials demanded that Tilden put trousers on the men, an interesting aesthetic and technical challenge. Tilden ignored the controversy and it faded away.< /Review>

Fine place to meet up with people or play giant checkers. It's a bit of a mixed bag though. You'll have some odd characters lurking around or an encampment put up a few steps away. The crowd changes every minute, so your experience may vary.< /Text>

< Review>
It is where people went after the 1906earthquake, there to plan what to do next. The statue in question refers to the Mechanics Movement of the ,19th Century which gave us all our builders and hands-on people. It was an international movement with Libraries and Centers in most advanced towns and cities.<//Review>

Not too bad, I don't recommend the fatty brisket.  Other than that tastes clean and water tastes like it's filtered which is great< /Text>

<Review>Taste is really good. Price is pretty fair for the location.
One gripe i seem to have is consistency. Ive ordered both through delivery services or take out and the serving size of brisket/steak or meat in the Dac Biet Large is hit or miss. I have gotten close to 8 slices of rare before and other times a measly portion.
All in all its a good place to eat< /Review><Response>None</Response>< pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Coworker had ordered the calamari and when it arrived, was literally inedible. It was rubbery and hard. Asked if we could change to something else and the waitress said "no, you already ordered it".  It was unexpected and disappointing.

Its unfortunate because their pho and egg rolls are pretty good.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcdbc147a28ba3:0x2a444637f18c3812<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Service is quick and prompt... Food comes out quickly. Quality seemed to have dropped since they first opened. Their broth for the pho is not that great and a bit salty--it doesn't have the aromatic beef broth smell & not flavorful--there are many other places in the OC with much better quality and much better prices. I would recommend the filet with rice, but these days it's seems to be soggy and has way too much sauce compared to when they first opened. In addition, their cans of soda is $2.75 each with no refills--a bit over priced, especially when I can get a 12-pack at Ralph's for this price when it is on sale. Finally, this was even a more disappointing visit only to learn that they NO LONGER ACCEPT AMEX.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRTVJleU4wj_nxMsjtqaTx5FBkX2Z72zT_fdPY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dcdbc147a28ba3:0x2a444637f18c3812</GmapID></record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>This is our go to pho place. The restaurant is clean and food is good. Things we like: rare steak pho, steak over rice, chicken banh mi, egg rolls, charbroiled pork with vermicelli noodles.

Also, take out is always nicely packed. If we order pho, we'll reheat the soup at home, then pour the simmering soup over the noodles and steak in a large bowl. Don't cook the noodles as you heat the soup, or it will fall apart and turn to mush!<//review>< Pics>

The new pho place just opened recently. We came here twice (both dinner time) and liked it very much. The interior is newly remodeled and beautiful. The pho broth is sweet and cinnamon-y than other pho places but I like it. We have tried several other dishes and liked them too. The BBQ meat is a bit on the salty side for my taste, the chicken is white meat so it's on the dry side. The seasoning is good though.   Overall, I enjoy coming here. It's so close to Cowan height so we don't have to drive to other pho places. If you like pho, give it a try.<//Text>

Ordered the Pho Tai Chin for takeout, and knowing I would be charged extra, I asked for extra meat. A regular sized bowl is 8.95. Arrived to pick up my food and my total came out to 17.95 😕. They charged over three dollars for extra rare steak and extra brisket each. At least let me know over the phone that you'll be charging extra for both and let me know the total so maybe I can change my mind? 🤷🏻‍♀️ And much to my demise, the extra amount I received was pretty dang sad. Me being my passive self, I still tipped and ended up leaving with a $20 bowl of pho. Flavor of the pho was good, but not worth $20, that's for sure. The brisket also tasted not fresh - had an unpleasant beefy flavor. I'd stick with rare steak.< /text>

<Text>Staff are very polite. One entree was forgotten but the staff apologized.

The food was delicious and made up for it. It tastes almost like mom's cooking. Will be back here if I'm rock climbing in the area.<//Text>< gmapID>

Finding a good Pho restaurant anywhere else in OC? Hard

This is probably the best Pho restaurant in Tustin, and if it was in Little Saigon, it would probably get a cult following as well. Decor is very hip and modern. Oversized wood chairs and floor give the space a warm feel and lots of natural light brighten up the place.

The broth is packed with aromatics. The cinnamon & star anise are very pronounced. I feel the brisket could be more tender. They bring your utensils out in this neat little woven basket.

Only down side I've seen here is the slow service, especially during the lunch rush. It took 15 minutes to get our food out to us. That's an eternity when you're talking Vietnamese restaurant terms.

Overall, solid spot for Pho and I believe I'll keep returning.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>Good food. Reasonable pricing. Slow service. It took about 10 minutes to get served after being seated though the place was half empty. That was after finally getting someone's attention. Food came out about 10 minutes later. No follow up afterwards. Check was brought out eventually and no one came back to pick it up. One had to go up to the counter to get it paid.
Iffy if I would return, though the food once was again was good. Ordered a couple of Pho's. Oh another thing of note; they were playing Christmas music as ambient sound.</Review><Date>1583881859978< /Date>< UserId.>

The service ain't bad either, the owner's kids sometimes help service the customers. So having their help, along with the other waiters/waitresses really made service easy to get. The whole place is very clean and the seats are comfortable as well.< /Review>

<review>I've only had pho a few times. The second time I ever had it (in a place in San Dimas that I've never found again), it was absolutely delicious and I wanted to finish the whole bowl. Ever since then, I've been trying to find a place that was that good. This is it.</review><Rate>5</Rate><Response>None< /Response><user_id>106208410364430818292< /user_id>< pictures>

<Text>The environment of the place is really nice and comforting, i arrived and got seated right away but they did take long to take my order i want to say it was atleast 10min before i had to stare at the waiter and then he came and took my order. I did like that he mentioned the lunch special which was basically what i was ordering so that was nice . The broth its self tasted really bland to me, im not one to add sriracha or the "brown sauce" to my pho and i did to this one and i added quite alot. I got the chicken pho and to me even though the broth itself was boiling hot the chikens texture just seemed thick and dull. The lunch special came with 2 eggrolls and they actually forgot to bring them out to me, i had to remind the waiter that my order also came with eggrolls. I was upset with the eggrolls because they weren't hot they were warm but ive had eggrolls where they are still cooking on the plate. The only reason im not giving it a 1 star is because the pho was hot and it stayed hot till the moment i finished it and it didnt look thick like most pho get when they start to cool down. Would i come back , no i wouldn't . Would i recommend it to people? no, but the place was pretty packed with people but this is my opinon.</Text>< Pics>

<Name>Julia Cassen</Name><review>The service was great and the food beautiful and delicious. The restaurant itself is spacious and very well decorated. Not your average strip mall vietnamese restaurant!! There were many booths not too close together and we felt very comfortable, not too close to other patrons.
I got pho and asked if it had msg. They weren't positive but found out after I ordered that the vegetable based broth is free of msg as opposed to the beef based broth. However, thankfully I had a very minor reaction to the msg as opposed to other restaurants. I would will ask to have the beef on the side next time so it doesn't cook too much before I eat it.< /review>< UserId.>

I am going to be a regular here. Later on drove by and business picked up around 7pm. Love this place.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

This is the best pastry shop in Bay Area. Very nice atmosphere and delicious deserts. Pretty good selection of tarts. Lemon tart has ideal balance of the taste. It is not too sour and not super sweet. Simply delicious. Chocolate eclair is also great. Definitely return back.<//text>

<review>Cakes are beautiful and delicious, love their buttercream. Pastries are delicate and tasty, can't wait to try more. Staffs are helpful. The only downside for me is that I ordered eatable flowers on top of the cake, they gave me sugar flowers, but it doesn't taste good, I would skip that next time. But still deserve a five stars review from me even with that!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnUTKGKbuoXaFVd69z7v_LrcYLviL-5OluMBjj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>{'time': 1620167739147, 'text': "A lot of love goes into our buttercream frosting, Jingjing, so it's wonderful to hear you're a fan and our delicate pastries are always something to look forward to as well. Our edible flowers can be quite sweet, which isn't for everyone, but we're grateful this hasn't detracted from all the fantastic experiences you've had with us.

The girl at the counter was the rudest person I have encountered in any shop anywhere in the world. Rolling your eyes, and asking "Is that it?" every two seconds when I am looking through the selection to pick up pastries for my family on a pleasant Sunday Morning is not customer service. And there was only one other person in the shop that was being taken care by another person. There are plenty of other places that sell cakes, and do so with a smile. I'll take my business elsewhere. The cakes look decadent. The pastries are better elsewhere.<//review>

You should go to Marvel’s not just to eat delicious stuff but also to see the beautiful designs of their boutique.
We tried 5 of their pastries and they were great. The best one was their pistachio tart. It was super super yummy.</Text>

Ordered a cake for my son’s first birthday. It looked like the most beautiful cake ever! Perfection! Exactly what we had in mind.. BUT.. It was a little too sweet. Buttercream layer was too thick and that was all we could taste at first. Had to cut away the buttercream which enabled us to actually taste the sponge and the Bavarian cream filling. The sponge was nice and buttery. A very rich cake overall. I wish there was more fruit component to cut the richness.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1610129574341, 'text': "Sakshi, it was an honor helping you celebrate such a special milestone in your son's life!

<Review>My story is that we went for our anniversary because my wife really wants to go and we eat the ceviche, the lettuce wraps, I have the hamburger and my wife has the steak. We are saying "my god, the food is amazing!" The ceviche was bright and had great citrus flavor, the lettuce wraps were perfectly sized and great meaty flavor, the burger was actually amazingly good (and I noticed a bunch of people ordered that), and my wife's steak was super flavorful, even if it's like 4 small pieces.< /Review><gmapID>0x808e356f486e5a85:0x31f1525057a7639d</gmapID><response>{'time': 1611982765464, 'text': 'Hi Janice\n\nThank you for sharing your experience but you put your review in the wrong business.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>My Hawaiian wedding was cancelled due to COVID but my fiancée and I made the best of it with a backyard wedding in Santa Cruz. Obviously we had a MUCH smaller guest list (8 people) but we still wanted to do the flowers, cake, etc. part of a wedding.

My fiancée took care of ordering the cake and said that the customer service was fantastic! When we realized we would be pressed for time on the morning of the wedding, he called to ask if we could pick up the cake the night before. The staff said no problem and had our cake ready by closing the night before our big day.

We ordered a small cake due to our smaller event but it was beautiful! The cake was so delicious - a simple vanilla - and the frosting (both on the outside and inside) was amazing. There were I believe four total layers and between each layer was a extremely light frosting with strawberries.

I can't even imagine was a more "traditional" large cake would look like. I was so very happy with our cake. It was just perfect.<//Review>< Pics>

Sadly you can only give 5 out of 5. This place deserves 10 out of 5! Extremely clean, I rather be here than my own kitchen.
It is beautifully decorated. Polite and helpful staff, all smiling, what's up with that?
I did not want to eat the pastry, they were too pretty to be swallowed. But I am happy I did. If I could, I would have had one of each and then some more.
Awesome espresso too. Took me to my favorite alleys in the South of France, or Barcelona.
The crossants smelled as if they were neighbourhood artisan crossants from Angers.
Will come back again, keep it up.</Review>

<review>I have used Marvel Cake for cakes, cupcakes and desserts for many many years now and she never lets me down! From the formal wedding cakes to the sculpted creations (that no one believes is a real cake), she is truly amazing! The best part though is that her cakes taste as good as they look.

I recently had my husband's surprise birthday party and I can say the cake was one of the best part of the party. Not only my husband was so happy and amazed by his cake but every single guest in that party was in wow. I had ordered a motocross hamlet since that's his passion. I had given Maryam one of his old and favorite hamlets to create something close to it. When I saw the cake next to the real hamlet on the table I could not believe my eyes. These attached photos don't even justify how wonderful the cake was. Once again, THANK YOU Marvel Cake for your gorgeous work, every detail was perfect. !

I could not recommend anyone more!</review><Resp>{'time': 1587618810267, 'text': 'Thank you Midia , it has been our pleasure and honor seeing you during these year and I hope to have opportunity to make your events , even sweeter.

Really enjoyed the Buon cha Ga (sizzling fish, rolls) - fish was tender with a slightly crispy exterior. Eat alone or with your traditional wrapped rice rolls. Red bean dessert is the best I've had in a long time!< /text>

<user_name>Carmen N< /user_name><date>1600465572145<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>This place has always been my favorite for chicken pho (pho ga). Their broth is very flavorful and the chicken is good quality as well as meaty! They give you the option to choose between white meat or dark meat. I also love that they automatically use the large flat noodles (banh lon) instead of the thin ones. That has always been my preference for noodles. Don't come here expecting top notch service because you won't get that anywhere in the Little Saigon area. Come for good food and a delicious dessert (che) that comes free of charge at the end of the meal. They also accept credit card as payment which is a huge bonus compared to other restaurants within the area. Overall, I've always really satisfied after my meals here. You really can't go wrong with their chicken pho!<//review>< Pictures>

Times before I'd come here with my fiance and I'd always see a black bug trying to get in our food. I havent been here in awhile and we decided on it today...I got bit 3 times and lost my appetite. My bites started small and started to swell up pretty bad. There was also the same bug in the restroom. Sadly felt like I wasted my money today and my appetite is completely lost still.</review>< Pictures>

The chicken noodle is tasty and healthy.  This place is known for a variety of good and reasonably price dishes.  Also a good availability of tables so one rarely sees a line at the door.  Take off one star for cleanliness.  Service is prompt and polite.< /review>

<Review>Pho Quang Trung was one of the very first Vietnamese restaurants I visited when I first came to Little Saigon (before I had even moved here), almost 13 years ago now.  Always packed on weekends, and almost always with a largely Vietnamese or Asian clientele, the food is consistently delicious, very reasonably priced, and widely varied so suitable for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.  This is still one of my go-to spots, whether to take friends in town visiting or to pick up a quick, delicious and nutritious meal to go for myself when I don't feel like cooking.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Maybe it’s because we’re not locals or we’re young or my husband is white but our server was very rude and brisk but he wasn’t with other tables next to us. The lady owner is very nice though. Wouldn’t come back here just because of the service. There are a million good Vietnamese restaurants here.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I liked the pho here. This pho dac biet, meat was very nice and tender. Tendon was nice and tender. The pho broth is a dark and rich broth which is just to my taste. I also ordered the imperial fried eggrolls. I thought there was too much meat and the filling was a bit dry. Loved the crunchy outside though. Overall good pho spot.</Text>< Pictures>

We had to leave could not eat in that heat especially when its 100 degrees outside. Why dont they turn on the AC 😑😑😌< /text>< Time>

Got the Com ga siu siu (chicken rice) here and it was pretty delicious. They gave a lot of rice and had a side of pickled veggies. I would eat here again.<//review>

They also add in the liver, kidneys, and hearts, which is my favorite part about eating here. Everytime we are about to finish our food, they always give us a bowl of red bean dessert on house. This place is overall a great casual place for cheap and delicious Vietnamese food.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This is my favorite pho ga place in California. The service is typical to Asian people (they'll get you your food and drink but then you'll have to call them over for anything else), but the food and free dessert are best in town.

Get a pho ga with dark meat and the dipping sauce!< /review>

(Translated by Google) Buy 3 bowls of pho, vegetables wrapped in a package. 2 herbs stalks for all 3 bowls. Should separate vegetables for each bowl. The person who eats first will not dabble in the vegetables of the next person.

Bun cha is also very attractive, if you want to change not to eat pho every day, the plate of vermicelli is worth the effort to wade out here to find a parking space and leave with a full stomach!

Phở ngon, nước ngọt, lại có chén chè đậu đen tráng miệng. Số dzách bà con ơi! Món bún chả cũng rất hấp-dẫn, hôm nào muốn đổi không ăn phở thì đĩa bún cũng đáng công lặn-lội ra đây tìm chỗ đậu xe rồi ôm một bụng no-nê ra về!< /Text>< GmapID>

I saw a very well produced Shakespeare play “As You Like It” and was happy with the theater area. The building is small and shares space with the public library so you get a little bit of foot traffic when you walk around the building. Also during the plays intermission there was not a whole lot of space for standing around and concessions but the play company did a great job with what they had.<//review>

<review>Drove out from Sonoma County to see The Comedy of Errors the other night, absolutely outstanding! They could not have picked stronger actors for the twin roles in this piece. I had a great time and would definitely visit for another production, even from Santa Rosa.<//review><name>Skylar Keller<//name>< userid>

Improvements have been made over the years, and the theater is quite comfortable today, with an expanded lobby area and comfortable seating. Easy parking, unless there's some major event in Davis Community Park, or at Brunelle Hall, across the parking lot. The VMC Theatre is home to the Davis Shakespeare Festival.< /Review>< pics>

Go here for the Davis Shakespeare Company when they're putting anything on! You're bound to have a good time. It's an intimate theater and they usually sell Sudwerk's by the bottle. During intermissions.</Text>

Buyer beware! The longer you rent from Jefferson Self Storage the more you will pay! They advertise low prices to get you in the door, next thing you know your rates are being increased above the average yearly rate of inflation. I have been a loyal customer for two years now, never missed a payment and now I'm being charged $168 a month for a 10x10 drive up unit, non climate controlled, while a new customer can get the exact same unit right now for $145 a month. How is that fair? Beware of their cheaper prices, their units are mediocre, the light in my unit has been out for two years now and they have a major pest issue being right next to a vacant lot in the back.
**Update 4/5/2021 Found a rotting, dead rat in the corner of my storage unit upon clearing it out. Rat poop all love the place and rat poison trash left in my unit by Jefferson Self storage, see pictures below. This is absolutely un-satisfactory for paying $167 a month for a 10x10 drive up unit. On top of barely any security cameras, limited hours of use, and a major rodent infestation problem it's obvious this storage company is absorbing all of the profits from increasing rent every year and not updating their services and storage. So you and I, the consumer pay more but get the same below standard service in return.

It was a pleasure to speak with you and find a solution suited for your needs. We truly appreciate your business and you as a tenant. If you have any further concerns that you would like to address please feel free to call me directly at 760-728-3548. Sincerely, Ashley\n\nGood afternoon Eddie.  I reviewed your account and spoke with the site team and they don't recall you addressing these concerns with them in the office. We have not had any reports of a rodent infestation. We routinely bait all vacant units and the bait traps around the facility to reduce the risk of rodent problems.  As I am sure you realize there would be no way for us to know whats happening in side your unit unless you let us know.  It appears you are taking advantage of the protection plan.  The office staff can explain that program to you if you have any questions. I was at the site a few days ago and it appears our cameras are functioning correctly.  Our access hours are 7 am to 7 pm and we have extended access hours for business that can provide a valid business license and liability insurance. If you have additional concerns, Please feel free to contact me directly at 714-777-2030.  James B. District Manager 4/14/2021"}<//Response>< gmap_id>

I was extremely upset with the customer service I received. To top it off, the person who help us was the manager. I need to tranfer the account to my name from my husband name thinking Since it was a transfer  of names, the fees would be the same. The manager never told me about the additional fees that would be charged. I realized that when I had already walked away from the office. Pretty shady to me especially since she is the manager, she should of explained all the fees and given me the option to choose to keep it in my husband name or change it altogether.  She Also raised the price, which she never mentioned and added insurance. I was very upset, I expect better from a manager. She also kept calling my husband  a different name. She is confused and shouldnt be a manager if she doesn't know how to do her job and she lacks customer service skills. My price should of never gone up and charged all the addtional fees just for a transfer of names! She should have given me an option,  I feel like I got ripped off.    We did speak but nothing got resolved . I am still paying more and your manger is still so rude.< /Review>

I needed a storage unit in the Murrieta area.  I had lots of choices and once I met Linda and her husband who have worked there for 18 years I knew I picked the right place.   Super clean units.  Most of all the service I received was friendly and fast.  I felt comfortable renting from them.  Super stoked I found a great storage place.<//Review>

Horrible experience with the staff on site today. I went in after getting a quote over the phone and once I arrived on site the two women said my quote didn't make any sense. They weren't enthusiastic about providing me with the correct pricing or availability and seemed annoyed to be at work. Once I asked for the number for headquarters because of there hostile attitude they wouldn't provide me with the number or there names and asked me to leave. I dont think i've ever encountered such rude customer service in this area. I wouldnt  recommened this place because of there unprofessional service which made me wonder how safe my belongings would be here. Public storage is what I ended up going with 👌< /text>

They are great I must really commend Catherine on her fantastic customer service. She was so fun and even took a picture of me with their Christmas decorations which were very festive. She went above and beyond giving us a great deal and discount on the Penske truck we rented to drive from California to Missouri. She has been doing it for 20 years and it shows as she is very efficient. The truck was good too oh and she threw in a hand truck for free. I highly recommend them.<//text>

Your candor is appreciated and I empathize with your experience, especially when it comes to signing documents prior to viewing the truck. Policies are set in place when it comes to using the free truck, such as refueling the tank, offering 60 free miles and returning it same day so that we can offer the truck to as many of our new customers as possible. I have reached out to the staff at Jefferson and we are doing a thorough investigation. Customer Service is an area I insist we be the best and will continue to stride for perfection. I assure you that I will find a solution and provide a better experience moving forward.

Do NOT trust Catherine!
I made a reservation online then got a call from the devil herself (didn’t realize until much later) confirming details of reservation. I was to get a unit and use the company truck (free truck use w rental was the reason I chose this company vs others). We talked about pricing, insurance, promotions, etc. and I was told to come in later that day to sign paperwork in order to reserve truck (unit had to actually be “rented” prior to placing reservation). I came in around 3pm to sign the paperwork. I met with Catherine. She and I again discussed rental terms, pricing and we also chit chat a little about ourselves. I learned that she has a 38 year old daughter, a 28 year old don and a “honey” (husband/boyfriend unsure) who is I believe 10 or 15 years her junior and if I remember correctly, she’s been with him 9 years. Her daughter is 7 months pregnant with her (I believe 4th) grandson and her son has no children. She is 60 years old this November (same age as my mother), she celebrated her 10 year anniversary w the company the day I came in, she only works 2 days/week at the Murrieta office but travels to other offices as well. I only add these details to explain that this is a woman I engaged with: listened to, opened up to (sharing bits of my personal life with as well). Earlier on shortly after my arrival there was a small issue with pricing (I was given a different price/unit size) which she tried to blame on online scheduling however, I reminded her that I spoke with her just 4 hours earlier and SHE was the one who gave me the information. She tried to back paddle a little but I stood firm and she suddenly realized that “oh yeah, the info given over the phone was correct.” I thought, “she’s a little ditzy but nice...” we continued. She showed me a couple of units then I signed paperwork and left. It would be two days before I’d come pick up the truck and move my things into storage. That Saturday morning I came to get truck. I was asked to sign papers confirming scratches on truck PRIOR TO ever seeing vehicle. My response? “I believe I should see the truck before signing this.” I was told their policy is to have you sign first because they’ve already noted the damage but we would do a walk around vehicle to confirm. Against my better judgment I signed. Catherine drove the truck up front and we did the walk around. I noticed many scratches but they all seemed to be fairly consistent with the markings on the paper I signed (which notated damage on all sides). She stated certain scratches were considered major while others were minor. Ok... she also mentioned that I needed to make sure gas cap is returned: “last driver did not return vehicle w gas cap and was charged for it.” Noted... I took possession of keys and drove off. On my way back to storage I stopped to refill gas approximately 2 miles down the road from storage and then drove to the storage. It was then that I realized my hubby and I were BOTH in truck and we had left our car at hotel where we were staying (literally 3 miles down the road). I called Catherine to let her know we’d be an additional 15-20 mins because we had to turn around to get car. She asked that we hurry because she needed to leave in about an hour. We obliged. Never thinking about the small amount of gas we’d used in the process. As we got back to storage I stopped by office but Catherine was with a customer and told me to start unloading and she’d meet me at my unit. She was there within 15 minutes: she walked around the truck (looking for scratches/damage) then asked for key. She started truck then came to tell me about overage mileage and then mentioned that the gas was slightly below the line it should be filled to an that she was going to charge me $8.00 for a gallon of gas. My response? “I’m not paying that.” It was literally about 1/8 off line. She IMMEDIATELY walked over to the passenger side of truck (2nd time) where she all of a sudden noticed a scratch that “was not there before.” BULL!! (I have to delete the rest because I’ve run out of characters 😒😡)< /review>

<Text>The food is clean and healthy and tastes very good. The only reason I won't give them a 5 is the service is extremely slow. It seems they don't have enough people working in there. There were a few people behind that walked because of how slow it is. That's a lot of business they are losing!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqBdidWyKu6V88PN5lLm4Y_HpFZ6ztWzwDbjj7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8gj6sbLxPnRjlyNL6d-wMRxdTW4kQAZGzGdX0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI-A4OA1KScasyVKcxgJmGPDguQIPP2irchn8_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Basically Subway for Greek food, I'd prefer if they didn't serve diced tomatoes and went back to the original full tomato slices, but other than that, this place is marvelous.</review>

I was in LA last weekend, and coincidently it was their opening weekend. I was glad, as I had tried The Simple Greek a year ago in New Jersey and liked it.
Got a Chicken Shawarma plate, and was not disappointed. Service was great and the owner seemed to be greeting everyone. Loved the spicy sauce. Though speed could be improved, I don't hold that against them on the opening weekend. They will get the hang of it.< /Text>

The staff asked if I would like something else instead. I asked about another menu item, and they told me that they don't serve that item anymore. So, I left without ordering anything.

I ordered the grilled chicken bowl, fries and baklava to go. The pita bread was tough, the chicken was in little pea sized bits like they were left over from someone else getting the nice pieces. The green beans were also in  bits. Hard to tell the flavor from all the bits. The hot fries were put in a container so they were soggy when I got home. The baklava was the worst ever. It had white stuff around it and I spit out the bite I tried and threw it out along with the soggy fries. Waste of money.</Text>

I love how they make the food fresh and its very flavorful.  I highly recommend ordering their famous lamb Gyros for $8.99 which is so reasonable compared to the amount of food they give you.  The pita bread was warm, lettuce was fresh, and they give you tons of lamb meat.  I like how the lamb didn't taste too gamy and you can tell the lamb meat they serve is fresh.< /text>

<text>The Simple Greek was almost empty while the neighboring restaurants bustled with customers; I should have taken that as a sign that the 4-star Yelp average was misleading. But the menu sounded appealing, so I went in.

Even though no one else was dining in when I got there, I had to scout around for a table that had been cleaned of crumbs from previous diners.

I ordered a bowl with lentils as the base. The lentils looked like they'd formed a crust on top when he scooped them out of the warming pan; they'd probably been there for a while. I added falafel, some cucumber, olives, tomato, tzatziki and hummus. Overall it was just ok. The falafel didn't have that crispness with the steamy soft inside that a good, fresh one has. Maybe it had also been sitting too long. The taste of my dish wasn't bad, but it just didn't seem fresh or particularly appealing.

I also ordered the Greek Fries. They were ready right away, because the fries were already cooked, being kept in a container. Maybe they were being kept warm or maybe thrown in the microwave to reheat? They were oily and limp -- you know, the way fries get when they are overdone and turn translucent and brown. Feta cheese and some barely discernible oregano were sprinkled on top. I ate about a third of the fries before I realized they were giving me no pleasure in exchange for the calories, so the rest went in the bin.

Overall, The Simple Greek is not a place I'd come back to.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>4< /rate><date>1611385917870</date><Text>LET ME BEGIN by I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Its so yummy! Their gyros are cooked as you order so usually everything is fresh... usually...but everytime I go, I'll be the only one there and will still have to wait 15 sometimes 20 minutes for food. Nearly everytime they got my order wrong and usually its that they forgot to include my spanakopita or my second gyro... if I at least got the wrong thing at least I would have something to eat! Good thing postmates lets me select for a refund when I dont get an item! Going in or takeout takes just as long. .....But the food is really good! So if you go here, just make sure to check your bag before you leave because there's a good chance that someone's not getting their dinner.

UPDATE: I went today and they got my order perfectly! Thank you so much simple Greek! New mgmt perhaps? Anyways? Thank you so much!!!!

<Text>Ordered online a half an hour ago, email said phone would be ready in 10 mins, I gave them a lot of extra time. Showed up. No order here. Okay they found the order, but it’s not ready, obviously. Every order they hand someone ends with “oh right! Let me go get that, two minutes.” None of them know how to work the register so nothing moves.

Pretty simple assembly line restaurant that can’t seem to get the basics down even with 4 people working the line. I probably won’t come back. Not worth the hassle.<//Text>< Rate>

I ordered spanakopita and a salad to go. When I arrived I was told it would be just a minute for the spanakopita as she "just took it out". I went to eat it and had an ice cold pastry to eat. I have been to Greece, never served it cold, was not good at all- no melty cheese goodness.</text>

<Review>I was going there a lot and the food is good, but they are always out of stuff. if you go in 2 hours before closing, don't expect to get what you want. I had to stop going because I felt like I didn't get what I wanted only what they had left over. Sorry, I really liked the place just not wanting to pay for something and not getting it. You have potential and I will come back every so often to see if you will do it right. And also stop being so stingy on the greens especially when you don't have any of the other stuff (potatoes, green beans, chicken). If you want to keep customers then give them plenty of food. I walk out still hungry.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1592283789342, 'text': 'Hi Lori\nThank you so much for your Feedback and i appreciate the Review.

<review>The food is quite good, but the portions are small.. I had to repeatedly ask one of the guys because he was giving me less chicken in my bowl than what the person in front of my got in her pita. I don’t understand restaurants that skimp on the portions. If you spend 20% more on food costs I will be much happier and come back twice as often. So 100% return on a 20% investment. Also, I’ll tell a lot more people about the place. Just my 2c<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

It is so easy to make but apparently the cook doesn’t have a cookbook. The chicken in my salad looked like it had been sitting around for days. It seems the restaurant has hired a lot of servers but didn’t invest in a trained cook. I really wanted to like this place but we won’t be returning.< /Review>< UserId.>

I’ve been really excited to try this place since they have Greek food and there isn’t a lot of Greek food places in my area, the food taste is fairly good but I wasn’t impressed, is definitely a healthy place to eat and the price is really affordable as well. Service wasn’t the best either since all of their staff is still not that fast and knowledgeable but I definitely think they just need more training. I hope to go back and get a better service in a few weeks.</text>

Food taste great but service is slow and they seem frazzled. Just about took my entire lunch hour and there were only 4 people in front of me. The pita was so over stuffed with veggies and vinegar and under stuffed with meat it was mush by the time i ate it (which was about 7min after i left). i would go back but definitely giving some time for staff to be trained and settled in<//review>

<Review>Just ordered from here on the Uber app.

The Greek Fries are described as having; garlic salt, feta, oregano, and red wine vinegar.  Mine were just fries and feta... so only 1 of the listed 4 above items.

On my Pita i requested white bread, traditional gyro, garlic cream, hummus, tzatziki, cucumber, feta, pickled onions, lettuce.  The end result did not have the garlic cream, hummus, tzatziki, or pickled onion (i did get red raw onion instead which i didnt ask for).

I understand that with the current restrictive circumstance getting some ingredients are hard to get, or if it was late in the day they may be out of some.  But i ordered around noon so i doubt they were short stocked and i doubt a Greek restaurant wouldn't have hummus or tzatziki in abundance.  Also if they were out of items they could've contacted me for substitutes.  Instead i received half of what was listed on their menu items of which i ordered.< /Review><Date>1588883836934<//Date><gmapID>0x80dd2b619b014d95:0x3cbd183b4f906e7b<//gmapID>< response>

I drive by this place every day on my way home from work so I thought I would give it a try. They had an ad for a BOGO on facebook for their Grand Opening so why not check it out. The staff was wonderful. Freddy was super polite,friendly and hilarious from beginning to end.

I ordered traditional gyro meat bowls with half lemon rice and salad and then added the feta,onion,garbanzo beans, cucumber and banana peppers with my sauces on the side. It also comes with your choice of white or wheat pita bread.

If you are not sure what sauces you will like the staff will give you samples of it to try. I sampled the tzatziki sauce as I am very picky about it and enjoyed it. I also really enjoyed the spicy red pepper sauce and greek dressing.

I know I definitely will be back :D</Review>

<review>Ordered online for pickup, wasn’t ready when arrived 25 minutes after ordering. While waiting, two walk-in’s arrived five minutes after us and walk out with their food before we received our paid for order. Meanwhile three employees on shift cared more about closing an hour early. Spend your money elsewhere.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Yummy food but extremely slow service even though I was the only one in line. They were low on veggies and cheese, so they were stingy when prepping my meal. I ordered Greek fries which come with feta... barely any feta and unseasoned. Disappointing. Their sauces are delicious, their falafel is dry and flavorless. I ordered my meal with tzatziki (sp) sauce but I asked for some spicy sauce at the end and they charged me $0.55 for the TINIEST drizzle. I'm hoping things get better. They were polite, just super slow and stingy.<//Text>< resp>

Ordered the Avgolemono soup only was told it would take ten minutes then I was told they didn't have any. So I ordered Greek fries and a pita.  Ate my pita had to go back to the cashier to inquire about my Greek fries which had been apparently ready but nobody brought them to me . Food taste like ant other Greek place some ingredients seemed dry or left or too long.<//text>

<Review>OK in pinch But definitely needs work.
As of November 2019, this is a brand New, small, fast food style Greek restaurant that's clean, and has decent parking.
New, young employees/staff are friendly, But definitely need more experience with food preparation and general cooking skills.
Similar to Chipotle style ordering, line up and choose your Basic Greek type menu items as they put together in front of you till you get to the register.
Ingredients are premade and generic. In my opinion, meats are not well seasoned and don't taste high quality, and the college kids meat cooking skills are questionable at best but at least appears to try.
In my opinion, for the overall quality and taste, this is a bit pricey for what you get and has that fast food, shopping mall flavor.
This is ok if you're in a rush or just desperate for some fast Greek type food.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dd2b619b014d95:0x3cbd183b4f906e7b< /gmap_id>< Rating>

For a place that just started up 7 months ago this place has lots of great products at a deal. The flower is great and they give you an amazing first time discount as well. I am a budtender in Colorado and have been enjoying cannabis for years and I thought this weed was great in appearance, flavor, and effects. Nice atmosphere and closely located to both Irvine, New Port and right off the bike path.

<text>ARE YOU READY FOR A CHANGE? Are you tired of being greeted by a voice behind a partition asking "New or returning? I need your ID and take a seat 'till we buzz you in".

Welcome to CHANGES...this is more than a business to Mike and his team. They are on a mission to CHANGE (hence their name!) the dispensary experience. This place is inviting, comfortable and friendly. I didn't feel like I just visited a black-market, dingy, speak-easy that I would need a vaccine to return to. It is just a normal inviting office owned and ran by folks who are very passionate about helping you get the best product to meet your needs AND BUDGET!!!

THEIR PRICES AND QUALITY CANNOT BE BEAT! PLUS, it's not in a "dodgy" location: it's in a nice professional business park. There are several buildings when you getting your product now, check this place out and let us know how they CHANGED YOUR dispensary experience! HUGE shout-out to Mike and his team!< /text>< Pictures>

This place is awesome! It’s well set up and the staff are professional and friendly. They really know their stuff and are very knowledgeable about their products (which are reasonably priced and top notch). They never disappoint. I’ll definitely be returning! 10/10 highly recommend!:)< /Text>

I have had my rec since 2006 so I have seen my share of dispensaries.
I would have to say Changes ranks in the top five. The only reason I say top five ,for now, is because I have only been there once. Spoiler alert - I plan on returning.
My first trip there was for a special they had but they had closed a little early (15 minutes so not complaining). I went back because I have had several friends who have recommended them for concentrates. I got their Avocado Diamond Sauce. I would have to say its potency is right where I needed it as I have a high tolerance and it was a very smooth tasting draw. I will definitely being getting more of this line as it has been awhile since I have had an extract that got me excited.
Not only did they make sure I had all the information I needed about their products they also honored the deal I originally went in for the first time. Honoring the deal was a rare gesture these days so I very much appreciated it.
I would highly (no pun intended) recommend giving them a try as I believe you will make a second trip.

I did have a few friends recommend it for full disclosure.
The check in was easy. The young guy (sorry I forgot your name), who worked in marketing for them, was very welcoming and knowledgeable about their products.
I went in for concentrates. I looked over their selection and for the first time in awhile I had a hard time choosing. I grabbed two as I was not able to make up my mind. They gave me a first time patient deal that I will not mention as I am not sure if it was just for me or for all.
I would recommend checking them out as it will not be your last visit.< /review>< pics>

Mike and Devin are awesome. They took the time to identify the flower that worked best for me and my SO (PTSD and Fibro), and they took us on a tour of other flower -- the sights and smells were delightful: none of this jarred, you can't smell nonsense.

They do their research, know what they're talking about, super transparent about the prices -- they're written on a wall as you walk in -- and they're the best price in OC: real value for your buck for fine bud.

They're amazing and you need to stop by if you're in need of phenomenal, well priced flower. Wonderful folks and vibes.

Ps

They have all sorts of products but I'm a flower type of person. Check out their website!<//Review>

Such a warm welcoming experience to be apart of
the “change” community. The art was so fascinating to look at. With that, the people had such a positive energy vibe. They even had a whole photoshoot set up where you can take some professional pictures. It was a fun atmosphere to be around. The merch was also fire 🔥</Text>

Great place, great prices, and 1st month free special. Everything's here to buy for your storing needs for low prices. Customer service is great here. Michael is a great manager. I had an issue there and he helped get me in contact with the right people and now a resolution is in progress. Will definitely keep my business here.< /review>

I have been very satisfied with the way in which I was dealt with in both a business and personal manner. It was refreshing to be able to deal with a capable, compassionate and professional agent as was such with Michael Niewars. He helped feel that I could be rest assured that my personal belongings were in a safe and secure establishment.  It's been a pleasure having done business with you all over the last 1 and a half years. Thank for everything Michael, especially your time and patience.< /review>

Easy and fast to get started. Walked in and was all set in about 15 minutes. The
Unit was clean and ready to use.
They do require a puck type lock so
Bring your own or buy one from them
For under 20.</Text>

Michael was absolutely a pleasure to deal with he was amazingly helpful got me and my man what we needed in great timing without any issues coming up or us having lots of questions. He was explaining everything so well that we didn't misunderstand anything. This guy should definitely get a raise for his great customer service and his ability to smile and work with customers that are upset before they get there and take it out on him because he stayed smiling joking and laughing it off to the point that it cheered me and my man up. Thanks so much for the great experience you rock Michael</text>

I love renting through SmartStop! I've been dealing with a lot but Gail made getting a storage unit so easy which was a BIG relief. Her customer service skills are exceptional and she thoroughly explained the details of the lease agreement as she showed me the unit prior to signing the contract. She also notified me that there will be changes to the insurance policy which was very thoughtful. I'd like to see more people employed with her work ethic and who shows common courtesy to customers.< /Text>

This storage facility I've been with for over 20 years. They have always went up and above to help & meet my needs.
I work out of town alot, and was almost late on my payment. Due to a phone # change was unable to contact them on time. Called the next morning and a gentleman name MICKLE was very understanding about my situation, he waved the late fee, took my information and all was better. If you need a good solid storage facility you can trust and feel secure with,, Lancaster's  Smart Stop is the place to be. Make sure you talk with MICKLE  he's the best.
THANK YOU MICKLE 👍!!

Angela was so friendly and helpful! She was patient with me while I called my husband to get his opinion on coverage. I got there 10 minutes before closing and not once did she rush me. Angela is a great part of this company and I’m glad she’s the first person you greet because she was so sweet and patient! Thank you for being there! I normally don’t leave reviews but Angela definitely deserves one! Please give her recognition, she was so great!</review>

Check in was a breeze. Angela was nice and professional. She showed me 2 units just to make sure I received what I needed instead of what was more expensive. Within 20 minutes my contract was explained to me and I was checked in. I highly reccomend SmartStop and Angela.<//Review>

Amazing storage business...very clean, great smiles from all the staff... Eric  customer services are amazing. Prices are great. We are so honored to have our valuables place in a safe secure location. If we ever need a storage again we will come to a family community that we trust in with our valuables. Thank you so much.< /Review>

I called the number and got a very helpful lady who answered my questions professionally and courteously. I put a unit on hold. About an hour later, Rene, the Property Manager called and confirmed. I had questions I thought of after I talked to the lady. Rene was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. We agreed to meet the following day. He showed me the unit which was perfect! I brought my dog and Rene welcomed him too. I wish I knew people to refer here. So if you need storage, the prices are great, set up in easy to get to units, just tell Rene I sent you.
Rene, thanks for making this mess easier and less painful. I truly appreciate you!< /text>

I never leave reviews but I’m I second time returning customer. I’ve had a few storage units over the time but smartstop storage is by far the friendliest, safest, and most affordable I’ve ever used.I feel 100% safe at night knowing that my possessions are safe there..  Angela and Rene are GREAT, very friendly, and trustworthy. 👍🏼👍🏼< /review>

Never took us to go see the unit or show us where it was, we go tonight with a uhual full of stuff and it's LOCKED!! I am furious I have to be out by 6pm tomorrow and still need to haul more stuff to the storage. Its 7pm and no storage place is open this is a huge inconvenience for us, I am demanding a full refund and someone to contact me ASAP!!! The call center supposedly emailed all 3 managers and called and got no response, don't understand how you don't have emergency after hours.</Text>< gmapID>

best storage in the A.V.  I have researched many storage units in the A.V.
this is the best. friendly, professional, clean and at a great price. I love the gates are open every day from 6am until 10pm. 365 days a year. a lot of the others places it is from 8 am to 5pm. 6 days a week if you are lucky? in that time frame most customers are at work! I love the fact I can go when I need to, not when I really have to. GREAT JOB GUYS !!! I am sorry there is a very few that complain and give a poor rating. there's 2 sides to every story.</review>

<pics>None</pics><text>Everything was ok except when I decided to go for a bigger unit. They changed their mind on including the lock after they said on the phone they would include it. Told me it was $111.00 for 9x12 but its actually $100 online, they were including property insurance without telling me. I let them know I already had insurance and they took off the extra fee. Also very pushy and scaring you into buying their lock so your stuff would be safer and at the same time arrogant about their facility never being broken into. So which one is it! Be careful all storage companies were too asky on what you are storing hmmm.< /text><response>{'time': 1577139462446, 'text': "Hi Ivette, we're disappointed to hear of the negative experience you had at our location.

I've been with them for almost a year and when it was time for me to move my 4 bedroom out, I felt like I was moving from family. The staff here are very professional and nice. The facility is always clean and they have free cold water. Rene is so helpful and a hard worker.  Thanks Rene for your professionalism and hard work. I would definitely recommend this place for a storage.< /review>

Greatest service I have encountered in storage services, never had an issue with my unit,service and any employee.
Rene is one of the best in customer service!
If I had my company still, I would get him out of there and employ him at twice what he is probably making there!
I highly recommend this company and it's services.<//text>

Rene is a life saver!!!  I needed a 9x12 unit before the 18th and he diligently checked for me and kept in contact with me for 2 weeks until one was available.  The stress of a move is crazy and he made this part so easy and even got me in with 2 days to spare!!!   I cannot say enough about his customer service!!!  I will be recommending Rene and Extra Storage to everyone I know!!</text>

Rene, the store manager, was extremely professional & kind. We got our unit with no problem & at a great price, compared to other places around. He had a lot going on, but handled it all very well.</review>

<Text>On 12/22/18 I was the high bidder for an online storage lien auction. This type of auction is when someone doesn't pay for there storage and the business auctions off the contents to the highest bidder.
The facility posts pictures of the contents of the locker and that is what the winner is supposed to receive. NOT THE CASE in my experience. The locker had been gone through with items missing. Needless to say, I demanded my money back. I'm posting this as a warning to other prospective auction buyers that this business goes through the lockers after pictures are taken and posted and before you come claim the items.< /Text>< pics>

Had gone to ExtraSpace on J-8 and they did not honor the discounts offered online. They sent us to another location--same problem. It didn't seem like they wanted our business. We were very fortunate to come here were Rene took care of us and sealed the deal first 15 minutes. His business is much better, much faster, and sincere. Would recommend this place 5 out of 5 before searching any other place that may disappoint you.< /text>

<text>This is the WORST group of people trying to run a business that I have ever encountered in my life.  They bought out The Mini U storage #1 in February 2015.  Their attitude and customer service sucks and they act like they are doing you a favor by storing your stuff there.  I have referred many neighbors and friends over the years but now I'm telling them to move out and go down the street to theMini U Storage #2.
SmartStop Self Storage #6014 would NOT honor the senior discount that Mini U Storage #2 gave me of 10%.  I am retired on social security and I get one check per month.  As soon as I get my money I pay all my bills early in advance as what I did here at this place.  I paid $34.00 on May 20, 2015 for the month of April 2015.  I gave them 10 days written notice that I was moving out on March 31, 2015, which I did and asked to be refunded my early April payment of $34.00.  They refused and said they don't do refunds.
PLEASE BEWARE AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY GOING HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE TO BE VERBALLY ABUSED AND DISRESPECTED!!!!!< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Hi...To whom this may concern, the manager Rene Osuna,  on -Sierra Hwy, was very kind and respectful...Mr. Osuna, greet me by saying hello,how are you doing today?  I think that was very thoughtful for someone to say hello with a nice smile... I will recommend my colleagues/friends to "Extraspace Storage" ,on Sierra Hwy and make sure they ask for Mr. Rene Osuna,  because (you rock) :-) :-)</Text><gmap_id>0x80c25a92853f4f1b:0xb17fdf9b995d08b<//gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_id>

<rating>5<//rating><review>My name is Leona Thompson and I've been a customer at that location for a while before the new owners that have come in and taken over ownership. I seen the location change hands three times. The first company I encountered we're very respectful and gave great customer service and I'd never had any complaints with them or issues. Then came the second company which was Smart Stop, I then met Eric, who was manager then I met Rene who was assistant manager whom lived on the property. Well earlier this summer I ran into so serious issues regarding my two accounts that I have there and I could not ask for better management skills during that time then I had with Rene and Eric, more so Rene. Because he was so understanding and patience to my circumstance. He personally took my issues and worked with me til they we're resolved in total, along with the Distract manager Joe Freeman. Eric was off property a lot, so I had to speak with Rene more, and I didn't have any problems being left in Rene's hands either. He is a great asset to the property you would be a fool to let him go. Now there was this woman I spoke to by the name of Britany while calling in to make sure payment for this month was received, I had spoke with Rene earlier and he said he was having problems with the computer system being slow and that to call back to see if the payment had been received or not that's how I ended upon the phone with Britney. Well Rene was out of the office and Britney was the rudest and nastiest person I'd ever spoke to in my life, and I'm in the 60's club.(My age) I kept asking her if my payment had gone through are not because I didn't want my credit card information just sitting aroung in that small office where someone could walk in and steal my information and before I could finish asking her could you please have Rene call me when he gets back in the office she hung up on me with a very nasty attitude. When Rene called me back later on I immediately told him I don't ever want to talk to that little girl again and I don't want her doing any of my bussiness there. He apologized for her behavior but it didn't take the nasty taste out of my mouth when it came to her. I've used storage units for quit awhile, for my children, family members and as well as friends for years.  So this is not my first rodeo. I'd like to make a suggestion if you would like to keep me as a very happy customer with your company I think you should let Britney know that at your company there's a certain level of professionalism your company is looking for and I strongly don't feel she meets that standard, because she don't. I don't trust her with my credit card infomation are having availability to my storage units, period. My first impression of her was not a good one at all. My small unit was already broken into and If it happened again to any of my units I would look streight at your manager Britney and her friends and family. I feel if I had a choice of picking for your company between Rene and Britany, I feel you truly have a diamond with Rene and coal with Britany. I started to pick Extra Space before I ended up there but that location had a special on line with a 10"12" which was $35.00 and at that time that was perfect for what I needed it for.  Because the service was so great at that location with the prior company and I later ended up moving to Las Vegas I couldn't think of a better more trusted management team then the experience I had with the two comapnys before your company took over. It all came full circle for me because I ended up with Extra Space anyways. I reserched your company last year and it was my number one pick. So I would like to welcome you and your team to the neighborhood and wish you much success at the Sierra Hwy location you now have taken ownership of.
