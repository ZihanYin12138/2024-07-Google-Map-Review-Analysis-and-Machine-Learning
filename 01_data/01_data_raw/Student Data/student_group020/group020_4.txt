This is the only barber I go to, I've been in plenty of shops and they've all had the same patters key elements that made my cut feel less valuable. A hair cut is the first thing people notice when they see you . Diamond Cuts is the only shop to not fail me; they provide the best service and have the most pleasant environment that anyone can be in . It's quiet, calm, and peaceful . It doesn't matter who you go with they will always get you looking right . They are awesome when it comes to pleasing the one I'm the seat, I've been experimenting with different styles and ways to do my hair and they have worked with me to get what I want, and even the ones I didn't stay with looked stunning . Words can not describe the effort of focus they put in to make sure you stay lookinh flawless 100%</Review>

Aside from being some of the most talented guys in the area, Jesus and his crew are the nicest and most genuine people you will encounter. I guarantee you you will come out of there feeling fresh and looking good...</Review>

<review>I’ve lived in the valley for 10 years now bouncing from barber shop to barber shop and I have finally found the one. Diamond cuts has very professional staff and the most clean sanitary shop I’ve seen by far, everyone that works there makes you feel welcome and glad that you are there they are very personable, highly recommend this shop!!</review>< pictures>

We are visiting from Northern California- and were very happy to find this shop.  Very clean and the staff was very responsive, as we didn’t have an appointment.  They did a thorough job for a fair price.    It’s difficult to find ‘real’ barbers in our area so this was a treat- and we will be back on our next visit.  Highly recommend Diamond Cuts.</text>

If you’re looking for a great place to get a haircut, Diamond Cuts is it! Jesus has been cutting my hair for almost a year now and I couldn’t be happier. His attention to detail is spot on! I highly recommend this place. Great location, reasonably priced and plenty of parking. You can’t go wrong here.</Text>

Amazing talented and creative professional.  Jesus is the best.  He pays attention to detail and knows what looks best on his clients from their overall facial features and head shape.

Truly an outstanding artist in his trade.

Jesus has the golden touch and guaranteed to make you look like a million bucks.

You won't be disappointed!< /Review>

Today I went to diamond barber shop for the first time and it was a great experience. Jesus gave a really good haircut; it was very clean and he was very professional. He made me feel welcome since the moment I walked in and he was a really nice guy. Needless to say, from now on this is my place to go for any haircut or beard trim.< /review>

Have been getting my hair cut here for months and Juan always does an excellent job. It's hard to find a good barber for my hairstyle but Juan nails it time after time. Not to mention the conversation is always great and the customer service is top notch. This will continue to be my go to spot in the valley.< /review>

From mid-fade to tapered haircuts. He would come in early to accommodate his clients and he will always be there for you when you’re in need. Always calls you on a busy day saying he is able to squeeze you in for a fade. This guy is very respectable and always gives you 110% of his attention so you can look good.

Then I found out he is opening up his own barbershop in Cathedral City called Diamond Cuts. I was extremely happy when i heard the news !!  Jesus has worked so hard to get here. I know he will run a great, professional and successful business.

If you’re looking for a great haircut, beard trim, and shave Diamond Cuts is the place to be. Friendly and helpful barbers. Always acknowledging when you walk in. Very courteous and very professional. And they take their time on you so you always look good. If you want to look fresh for that job interview or that first date go to Diamondcuts.org to schedule your appointment today. Or just simply walk-in. Jesus and his team will take care of you.

Always a loyal customer here</review>< rating>

I booked Jesus and Zay for our youth convention to be cutting hair as a thank you to our youth pastors. We were tremendously blessed with their amazing skills. Let me say that Jesus the owner of Diamond Cuts is very professional and humble. After calling so many places most barbers would demand certain stuff after explaining what exactly my event was all about, but Not Jesus! Zay was very professional when he took my call and was kind to let me know he would return my call as soon as he would talk to his boss (Jesus). I was calling all the way from NorCal and trying to find someone to work for my event that took place in Palm Springs. It was a bit of a hassle but thank God I found diamond Cuts. Jesus and Jay took care of my needs and went above and beyond. I extremely recommend this barbershop ! Make sure to ask for Zay and Jesus for your next cut!

I will definitely be hiring them for my next event !</Review>

Being an African American visitor from the Columbus, Ohio area for a trip my wife won from her Company, Brookdale Senior Living, I was looking for a barber that would be able to take care of trimming and shaping my beard without worrying about whether it was the first time they would have done it for my hair type. After checking out the website, I decided to drive from the Hilton Miramonte Resort where we were staying to Cathedral City and Diamond Cuts for a walk-in.

I was given to Zay Aispuro, who not only was an engaging conversationalist, but a barber "par excellence". Where I was used to having clippers and scissors, Zay included hot towel treatment, straight razor edge and spray aftershave.

I not only highly recommend Zay, but the entire shop for anyone who is either visiting or lives in the Palm Springs area. It's worth the drive from wherever you are, because they will take excellent care of your needs. You will not be disappointed.<//review>

< Review>
So I went to buy some dress shirts for a party right? I get there and see a sign which clearly said "buy one, get one free". Obviously I was like "MANDOOOZZZZZZ". The shirts were all priced under $30 which seemed to be wrong because the cashier told me that the total was about $50. Y'all got some false advertising over there chief.</Review>

<review>My son is a very picky kid who doesn't like just anyone cutting his hair. Rocio cut his hair, I guide her to the exact of how he wanted it. He ended up liking the haircut very much. I suggest you to bring cash if you don't want to get charge $2 when you pay with your debit card. Other than that the service was good.<//review>< Pics>

Came here to do an Ombre style on my virgin hair, Ady the salon owner was the one who was working on my hair, when she unwrapped my hair from the foil to my horrible surprise she bleached the crap out of my hair she damaged & fried it. When I pulled on my hair when it was wet it was ripping off it looked like string cheese no joke. When she blow dried my hair it was breaking and falling all over the place! it was horrible I was so sad & this is the owner of the salon I'm talking that did this. It's been 2 years now I spent so much money trying to get my hair to being healthy & since that day my hair doesn't want to grow anymore & I take prenatal vitamins biotin & nothing.</text>

Lowlights and highlight to bright red. I've been having my hair colored and bleached and has nvr been damaged. After she colors my hair she does a treatment which is amazing. I love everyone that works there they are all friendly they greet me once i walk in. My son also loves getting his haircut there. Michelle does an amazing job on my nails she understand how I want them just by describing or I show her a picture and she does it exactly like how it is on the pic.

<text>This Salon is stacked with skillful young women.who are in the know, when it come to hair cuts,trims and layers this salon does it and beyond
The beautiful young woman that sayt me in her chair gave me more than just a trim n a line up. She was playful an had a great sense of humor.my stylist was very  intelligent  we conversated about  family while she had me calm as I never been before.
A taper on the sides and back came out to 8$. She was very QUICK and accurate with the tools of her trade I have been at peace when goin to a new stylist.she and the entire staff are inviting and pleasant to be around  .when ever I'm in need of a trim I'm headed over to see my new stylist jasmine .. give these talented and AFFORDABLE  women a real chance to  earn  your business. I promise you won't be disappoint

(Translated by Google) I recommend the place. But the young man who cuts hair. It's not nice at all I think he doesn't know how to cut hair. And it's not like the girls who are telling you how you want him and things like that, he's just in their world and doesn't put stress on the child.

(Original)
Recomiendo el lugar. Pero el joven que corta el pelo. No es nada amable pienso que el no sabe cortar el pelo. Y no es como las muchachas que te esta diciendo como lo quieres y cosas por el estilo el solo está en su mundo y no le pone a tensión al criente.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I went to shave my hair and Mrs. Ady burned my scalp and my hair told them several times that I was burning and a lady who is just there gossiping talking about the other employees said she was examining Mrs. Ady could not I didn't even say to my face that my hair was falling apart, I knew that nothing was happening the next day my family checked my head because I was complaining that it hurt and they realized that where I had to have streaks I had the wet hair that I I burned it and I didn't even iso anything. She just told me that she will try a treatment that would be applied so that she will apply it to me as I will return with her after what I iso ... that place has very good stylists but to Mr. Ady does not really care about his clients and perhaps a person does not make a difference but little by little he will begin to accumulate the clients that were treated badly hopefully and change his way of hiding the things of his clients and start to assume its responsibility

(Original)
Fui a areglarme el pelo y la señora Ady me quemo el cuero cabelludo y mi pelo les dije varias veces que me estaba quemando y una señora que nada mas esta alli de chismosa hablando de las demas empleadas dijo que estaba exajerando La señora Ady no me pudo ni decir ala cara que mi pelo se estaba callendo se iso que no pasaba nada al siguiente dia mi familiares me revisaron la cabeza porque me estaba quejando que me dolia y se dieron cuenta que donde segun tenía que tener rayitos tenia el pelo mochado de que me lo quemo fui a desierle y ni siquiera iso nada solo me dijo que tratará un tratamiento que fuera para que ella me lo aplicará como voy a regresar con ella despues de lo que me iso .....ese lugar tiene muy buenas estilistas pero a la sr Ady en realidad no le importan sus clientes y talvez una persona no aga la diferencia pero poco a poco se le ban a empezar a acomular los clientes que fueron tratados mal ojala y cambie su manera de esconder las cosas de sus clientes y empieze a asumir su reponsabilidad</Text><time>1469674503302<//time><user_id>104297339202234449583<//user_id><rate>1< /rate>< pics>

DMV issues? Isaiah to the rescue! Felt so lucky to find him; absolutely the best way to navigate the maze of regulations, inspections and confusing info, instead of struggling to figure it out myself! Isaiah got my car street legal the same day, then directed me to all else that was needed to solve my issues. He's exceptionally kind, helpful & accomodating, and also very professional and knowledgable. Great service, reasonably priced. Highly recommended!! Thanks, Isaiah.</text>

<Name>Duranya Freeman</Name><Text>Isaiah is just the best. Save yourself a headache - skip the DMV and call him, he's quick, extremely knowledgable, and professional. He helped me with a private party sale out-of-state title transfer & application, inspection & registration AND replacement plates. It was so much faster than I thought it would be, and he had all the materials right there in his office. Never met anyone better at their job, and he also was very kind and didn't make me feel silly if I had questions. I also went in right before a move up to NorCal and was really stressed I wouldn't be able to get everything done on time but he took care of it all.

What a great place! My registration expired 3 months ago. I needed to pay it as soon as possible but with all this pandemic happening I couldn't reach out for anybody at the DMV. Isaiah helped me right away. What is going to take me the whole day at the DMV, He did it in 20 minutes. He is the best!!!</review>

I just bought a car from a friend of mine and needed to get it transferred into my name and Isaiah was incredibly helpful with the process. When I called he made sure I had all the correct paperwork before even coming in. He had everything taken care of in no time at all. Very great guy, know’s what he’s doing and would absolutely recommend him and his services.< /Text>

5 stars doesn't seem like enough stars. I came from Texas and had to register and get my California plates just as the Covid pandemic struck and had anxiety worrying if I was able to get this done. Isaiah helped me out so much, he was very professional and made sure I had everything I needed with me while we waited for my items to come in. He went above and beyond, excellent service. Definitely recommend.< /text>

I had to transfer Cororado state title in California, and Isaiah processed whole thing about 30 min. He got me a sameday appointment and a new licence plate (he helped put a plate on a car)!!

Im glad that I didn't go to DMV office during the Covid.
I definitely recommend this place!!< /text>

<Text>Isaiah is the man! I came from out of state to register my car here (which was previously registered in California.) This caused some issues and would require me to send paperwork to the DMV field office with a turnaround time of 4 weeks. Through his connections Isaiah managed to get this done for me THE NEXT DAY. I had my plates, stickers and everything ready to go just like that, no hassle. It's definitely worth the extra bit of money to not deal with the headache that is the DMV.< /Text></record>

< Review>
Isaiah was extremely cordial and really looks out for his customers on prices and care. He gave me a good referral for a smog test which allowed me to get a discount, helped with all the vehicle registration processes and paperwork, and really saved me the hassle, confusion, and time expenditure one usually experiences at the DMV. Isaiah got all this stuff done while I continued working full time and didn’t have to take time out of my day to sit at the DMV. He even offered to put the new plates on my car. I highly recommend Isaiah’s services to anyone reading this and will to everyone I know. Trust me, I read the reviews before going to him and it was totally worth it. Give Isaiah a call if you value your time and want a friendly experience. Do it today!</Review>

{'time': 1574981574819, 'text': 'Dear Samantha,\nour office provides DMV reg services with appointments ONLY. It is written in print as you enter the 1st floor Lobby. However, since you came in without an appointment, we tried to accommodate you and told you that our DMV technician should arrive in about 15-20 min. We have a lobby where you are welcome to wait.\nWe understand you called, yet our technician was not in his office, hence why your call went to voicemail. This is why we urge customers to make an appointment prior to arrival. We do not want to waste your time. Our DMV technician came in specifically for you, and did not see you in the waiting room. Thus, before writing a review, please give us the opportunity to serve you with an appointment. It is only fair. We apologize that your simple matter took hours to solve at the other DMV location, where you had to wait 2-3 hours for service. Our sincere goal was to accommodate you and save you your time and money, even without making an appointment beforehand. It is unfortunate you did not see it that way. We would appreciate your unfair rating removed please!\n\nSincerely,\n\nIsaiah, DMV Technician'}</Resp>
<Review>I hate to tarnish their perfect rating but I went in (not really knowing what it was... google just showed it to me first) and someone was at the desk and even though I didn’t have an appointment, this man called the other guy for me and said it was ok which I thought was really nice. But then I went to move my car because he said he’d be there in 15 and I could come back in 15 and when I came back the door was closed and locked. I called the number numerous times to no answer. it had maybe been 10 minutes or even 15 but definitely NOT more than that. I knew I should’ve stayed there. Incredibly disappointing service and now I’m sitting in the DMV for over 2 hours for something pretty simple. I believe the positive reviews are true, but since I seem to have no other way of contact I wanted to express my disappointment here.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

Isaiah was fantastic. He helped me register my car, transfer the title, and even went as far as drilling the new plates into my car. Amazing customer service, and he saved me so much time and hassle. Easy 5 stars!< /text>

<review>Someone hit my car and left a note with some DMV related info, but no contact information. I was looking to get that info and while Isaiah couldn't provide me with the actual information I was looking for (privacy issues), he gave me very helpful guidance regarding what I could do to address my situation. He was super friendly and knowledgeable and gave me a path to resolution, which will save me from spending a lot of time and energy trying to chase info or figure it out myself.  Thanks, Isaiah - very much appreciated!</review>< user>

<review>At first I was skeptical of all the 5 star reviews, but needed to get my registration renewed ASAP and I didn’t have time to wait in line at the DMV. Isaiah was AMAZING!!! The BEST customer service I have ever experienced.  It took less than 25 minutes!  There was a $50 expedited fee but I would pay that any day then waiting 3+ hours in line at a DMV.
He is AWESOME and an all around great guy!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>This place is the spot, Isaiah was an incredible and helpful associate. The business itself is very clean and very professional. Paying $50 for an expedited fee is well worth not waiting at the DMV for 4+ hours. I was in and out in no more than 30 minutes. Very, very satisfied.</text>< pics>

<Review>Completely satisfied with this service which began with a phone call conversation with Isaiah who patiently reviewed my registration requests/concerns and informed me of  everything needed to finalize my actual request.  Called later, set up an appointment, immediately met Isaiah, and within 15 minutes (give or take) I walked out with my registration papers and sticker in hand. When you are pressed for time, this option is definitely worth it. And this was all completed with outstanding, tickets, penalty etc. No DMV Station and wait time/s !! It was a pleasure working with Isaiah who exemplified excellent customer service and patience!< /Review>< Pictures>

I came here on a busy mid-day Saturday to get my registration renewed after finding the DMV closed in the AM. Isiah helped me out immediately and even referred me to a smog check very close by when it turned out that I needed one. Overall, the service was quick, professional, and efficient - The complete opposite of every DMV visit I’ve ever had. Highly recommend.< /Review>

<Text>I recently had a bad experience with Auto Tagz DMV Service located in Sherman Oaks on Moorpark and Woodman.  I was charged $1,300 but my DMV receipt says I paid $935. Plus the $79 service fee I was told ahead of time.  When I asked for a breakdown they told me I would get an email and I never got it.  I called DMV RER SERVICES SHERMAN OAKS at 7:00 PM and someone actually answered the phone and all of my questions.
They calmed me down and told me exactly what to do to figure out it was a mistake the other business made.  ”I call it ripping me off”
I can't express how grateful I am to have found honest people working for the government. I will recommend everyone I know and speak about this company when I hear about anyone needing help with DMV.

Saved the day. After a back and forth with the DMV, I was forced to stand in what looked like a 3 to 4 hour line leading out the door. I found this place and called from the line. I met with Isaiah Movsesyan and had my registration sorted out in 30 min. This is how the DMV should be. The $50 expedited fee was well worth my time.</text>

<Review>Isiah was very welcoming and helpful during the process of registering my vehicle to CA. Anything dmv related is never fun, but Isiah made it easy, fast and painless! He helped fill out my forms correctly, had everything you needed right there and had great conversation. I definitely recommend Lusnak Motors for your dmv services, skip the lines and be in a comfortable space!</Review>< Date>

<review>Have never been more disgusted and disappointed in a dr as I was today with the young dr with the messy bun that came in with a arrogant move it along attitude. What a disaster this place is.... the female dr we had on our first appt was nice and kind hearted but this kid dr has no empathy or want to help in any way. Absolute disgrace to call himself a “doctor”.< /review></record>

<text>Im surprised at how many negative reviews there are. My son and I have been coming here for 5 years with no issues. Dr Kearns is an amazing doctor. She really listens to you, doesn’t rush the appointments, repeatedly makes sure you don’t have any questions. I love her. There are times residents have tended to me, but never without her direct supervision.  Some appointments take an hour or two, some take 10 minutes. I understand I’m not their only patient so I don’t mind the wait.</text>< Pictures>

This place just isn’t ideal. The doctors are residents, meaning they’re still in training and aren’t quite sure what there doing. Before having our last doctor leave we we’re pretty happy with our experience. However, our new doctor has scheduled phone appointments in the morning and not gotten back to us until 3pm or sometimes, just not at all. When we called back about the appointment they had said we missed it and had to reschedule. My mom has also has needed medication for weeks that her doctor refuses to review.<//review>

Quality of help is very subpar. Waited an hour only to be seen for less than 5 minutes. Had additional questions I wanted to ask, doctors rushing me out so they can see someone else. Was not helped in any way besides an ibuprofen prescription - something I was taking anyways, and telling me to "stretch" like I haven't already been doing that and it hasn't gotten better. You go to the doctor to get help. Not whatever I came in today for because it wasn't help.< /review>

Regret ever coming here!  The doctors are residents, which pretty much means you're their experience! Takes forever to be seen, the place is chaotic! The front desk girls are very unprofessional and need better training! Find somewhere else to go!< /Review>

The undercurrent of chaos in this clinic isn't doing anybody any good. The pandemonium is not only distracting and frustrating, it's a poor reflection of the professionalism and medical expertise, the clinic, staff members, residents and colleagues provide. Moreover, you can be certain that your patients notice the rude attitude of MA. I personally had a very bad experience with JOSE A an MA who doesn't have any work ethic he is rude over the phone, and not organize to look at the patient charts, to schedule or delete cancellations. Proper grooming and a professional appearance are important to gain respect in the workplace, very poor.<//Text>

This is the worst medical office I have ever encountered. They have zero organization, lost incredibly important paperwork on more than one occasion sent the wrong paperwork to my employer causing me to be almost terminated. The wait times here are worse than the dmv at times. Most of the staff is rude and not properly trained. They lose communication the minute you are not in front of them if you can avoid this office stay very very far away.</Review>

I haven't ever waited longer than 30 min in the waiting room & usually almost 2 hours by the time I leave the office. Dr. Gorman accepted me as a new patient when I came to him 8.5 months pregnant without any prenatal care. Hes still my Dr & now my 9 month old sons Dr too. Gorman is also the medical director for Genesis (Opiate replacement therapy/detox center) & is a professional & educated physician.< /Text>

You never see the same dr and if you have to see the same one they give you the run around, I had to call every day for a week to get an appointment that was weeks out. They won't even release me to go back to work. They don't care about their patients. The wait is hours long, their receptionists are never happy to help. Go somewhere else if you can, this place sucks!< /Review>< Time>

Every time I went there, I had to wait more than couple hours. Descrimination in so apprearent. Some nurses admit patients who have appts after my appt! And they tell me that there are no room available at the moment! I told the front desk about it and my doctor, but nothing was done. I don't go there anymore.< /review>

The employees at Dutch Brothers are always energetic, upbeat, and helpful. The coffee however is weak and in my opinion tasteless; and I always order a triple shot latte in a medium cup. I have never truly been satisfied with a Dutch Brothers latte which tastes mostly like sweet warm milk devoid of coffee flavor. The 3 stars are for Dutch Brothers fantastic staff and quick convenient drive through format. Please consider switching to more robust and flavorful coffee beans.Become a 5 star coffee leader.</review>

Whenever there visiting my family I go to Dutch Bros for the best coffee, cocoa and customer service. You guys far outrate Starbucks which is rubbish. Just wish you folks were here in Florida, you could give Starbucks a run for their money.  The only major competitor for Starbucks here is Duncan Donuts and neither company shine in comparison.</Review>< UserId.>

<review>Love the coffee, always a consistent cup, but wait times are insane. I have to leave my house 15 minutes earlier if I want Starbucks before work. Not their fault by any means, just means it's a damn good cup of Joe.< /review>< pics>

They don't provide a simple cup of black coffee. They mix in water with Expresso.
How about a couple of different roast black coffee? Too many Fo Fo drinks.< /Text>

<Review>Always love the coffee or any of their products.  However, this location offers some access challenges. Not sure there is any space for any kind of remedy.

<time>1528729202429<//time><Text>It's been getting worse over that past year. Girls with nasty fingernails running their fingers through hair then making drinks, touching tips of straws, wiping hands on clothing, scratching makeup coated faces. caring about how good they look over getting your drink right.. also  too many hipster dudes period... bro beards and tattoos are not supposed to be making drinks.. I feel like I'm going through a prisoner drink line...

We usually spend $200 or more per month, but not anymore. I went out to Anderson and got a wrong order, then took it back and they argued with me over it, then went into Palo Cedro and they have gotten the same order wrong 2 more times.. It is also rediculious when waiting in line, then 20 people walk up to the window. They do not take drink orders in order, so I was in a 4 car line for 30 minutes.. tired of wasting my money.. these companies will only comply when you stop spending money..</Text><response>None< /response><userid>110225303702236306175</userid></record>

< Review>
Great coffee and great customer service. But this place has so much traffic in the mornings when I pull in. Each side has 4 to 6 vehicles and each one takes about 4/5 minutes. It's too long to wait for coffee.
I usually pass through on a Friday or Saturday morning. I know Palo Cedro is a small community but 2 stands might turn just as much profit...<//Review>

And the girl in the window tore up one of my cards and said I didn't have enough. Then tells me "I'll give it to you today" I go to Dutch bros on a normal basis and this has never happened.  Really disappointed with the service today.< /review>< Pictures>

Every time I go to this place the coffee is very well made I started off really enjoying the caramelizer but now I'm hooked on the hot white mocha sometimes I'll pass it and not act interested so my girlfriend brings it up so I don't feel bad for bringing it up all the time</text>

Nice free sports facilities inside Balboa Park. They have lots of table tennis tables that you can use and lots of people play there. Best price in town<//Review>

<text>Went here for table tennis open play. It's a good sized activity center, and is sectioned off for multiple activities. Not the newest or fanciest looking facility, but serves its intended purpose well from what I can tell.< /text>< UserId.>

Great place for Badminton. Mondays and Wednesdays they turn into volleyball courts so you can't Badminton after a certain time.
There is a wait if you go during the peak hours. Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings are usually crowded. But you can still find a court but you will have to wait. They also give you a racquet if you are a newbie so feel free to drop by even if you don't have equipment.</Review>

Nice facility and great staff. Volleyball open play Monday and Wednesday 5:30pm - 8:30pm. Only drawback is when it rains some parts of the ceiling leaks so they will shut down the courts.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>How have we not been here before? We live short walking distance from here and will make it our go to sushi place from now on. Absolutely delicious. Staff is friendly and welcoming. We had the baked salmon roll and the crazy mackerel roll, along with a pint of Sapporo. Perfect meal out on the patio on a spring evening.<//Review>< pics>

Stopped at this sushi place just wanting a quick bite. Boy, was I in for a treat! Service was a little slow, but I think they were short staffed so they get a pass. I got the Baked Salmon California Roll for 10$. Not only did it fill me up, but it was so delicious! The salmon was very crispy and warm and complimented the cold California roll. I would definitely come back here for another sushi roll<//text>

<text>Very bad first impression.  We went as a family (total of 5) after my son's graduation as he loves ramen and we wanted to try a new place.  The waitress was very rude.  Told us to wait for a table and later asked us to "go outside and pick a clean table if we could find one".  I took a look and all of them were with leftovers from previous customers.  It is like she knew, it was 8:45 p.m. and although they close at 10:00 p.m.,it was clear she did not wanted to serve any more customers.  The chef behind the sushi bar observed the situation and I could see the shame and shock on his face.  Needless to say, we left the restaurant.  If it was my business, I would not want a waitress like her working with me.  It will damage my business and push away new customers.< /text><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80dcd2ad26ee36bd:0x7c280b09111da666< /GmapID><Rate>1</Rate>< Response>

<Review>Quiet place with an amazing staff and selection of FRESH sushi. Sit inside, outside, or get up close and personal at the Sushi Bar where you will always be impressed. Prices are budget friendly, with a great assortment of dishes & drinks. A must visit when in the area.<//Review>< pics>

Wow what a gem. This was very very good! I loved everything except for the garlic edamame (I think it was overcooked). I rely liked their hot green tea. It was fantastic.
We also ordered 3 special rolls, yellowtail collar (good big portion), miso soups and peach sake. Everything tasted spectacular. To bad I live far and just stopped by on the way back from the temple.<//review>

This current Owner of this establishment in this location is spot on. The sushi is delicious. The chefs are what make this place what it is. The waiters and waitresses are okay but it's the quality of the food that keep taking us back here. The R&B music playing in the background is one thing we always remember when we come back here year after year. Nice atmosphere. The price at this time is 1/2 off of most of the sushi! Great deal at this price! The overall experience brings us back every time.<//Text>

<Review>I go there at least once per week for lunch sometimes twice.  It is by far my favorite.  You can't beat the pricing.  (and I am not staff as someone accused of good reviews being from staff) I do have to say their staff has the best customer service.  The Bento box is huge!  Best tasting Teriyaki Beef ever!  so tender and flavorful.  Yum!  Haven't tried the Chicken but most likely someone in my group tonight will.  Highly recommend.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Pretty good service but the food lacks flavor.  The rice didn't taste like sushi rice.  The rolls were constructed fine and looked good but had an odd taste.  If you just want to fill up late night, this is the place.  I now just come here to drink.< /Review>< Pictures>

Good sushi at a very affordable price. It is located in a plaza surrounded by residential homes. The family meal (3 any rolls, 3 handrolls, 3 sushi, and one sashimi) is a steal. The raw fish is fresh comparing to other restaurants in the similar price point. My kids love their cooked rolls (sauce on the side). The service was good and attentive.< /text>

Their chefs are amazing, the service is wonderful, and the food is easy on the wallet but delicious as well. They have a large variety on their menu and if I went every day for a few months I'd probably still have more things to try. Their platters are also perfect for parties and gatherings.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dcd2ad26ee36bd:0x7c280b09111da666< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Great service and even better food! The sushi chef is always friendly and even enjoys a sake shot with us on occasion! This spot is super close to home and they will order sea urchin & quail egg upon request. They also have a great deal on drinks buy 2 large Sapporo, get a Kirin of sake or a 3rd large Sapporo free!< /Text><UserId.>106818439489177998351<//UserId.><user_name>Michael Zacharczuk< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

I do really love this place. Sophomore year, I spent half of my weeks here to escape my demons and my homework. Each bite of the rainbow roll was a little antidepressant, but don't count on that healing to last! Because the second your plate is empty you'll remember that your to-do list includes three essays and a lab, but does not include a boyfriend.< /review>

When they first opened this place was excellent . The Sushi Cheff was amazong and the fish was top quality. However,  unfortunately the Owner had no clue how to market a good thing the Head Chef is only there sporadically the quality of the fish has diminished, in short  they have fallen downhill .  The service is still very good and if Rolls are what you are looking for are decent.  However,  if you want real Sushi or Sashimi your going to be utterly  disappointed. What a shame.</Text>

These kind, professional gentlemen were absolutely remarkable! My move was brutally hard. Each one of these men reassured me throughout the move that they had it under control and I didn’t need to worry. I am disabled and could not possibly have done this move without help. If you are someone who takes the time to read reviews please take this one seriously. My late husband and I had our own business and I had never ever worked with another group of men besides our own that were so good at what they do.<//review>< Pics>

One of the news networks will be investigating this awful company!! Our family hired this company and their truck caught on fire due to an electrical problem in the engine. The fire destroyed my prize possessions and a lot of my important business equipment. In the beginning, I tried many times to reach their company to discuss my claim and they ignored me over & over for 2 months. Because they are so irresponsible, I finally turned the situation over to my attorney. It's been nearly one year already and they are still refusing to honor my claim. They are playing games with my attorney by ignoring his letters. Because this company is heartless and unprofessional, I had no choice but to report Q Shark to one of the news networks I'm affiliated with and they said they would do a full investigation if this company doesn't make good on my claim.Once this story airs on the news, they might wake up to the fact that it's very irresponsible to treat their clients with this much disrespect!! If you hire Q Shark you are taking a chance! If there's a problem, I guarantee they will not care nor will they help you with your claim! DO NOT HIRE THEM IT'S TOO RISKY!!!< /Review>

I used the moving company 12/15/2020.  They moved furniture from my storage unit as well as my 3 bedroom home, to my new 3bedroom home.  It has taken me some time so sort things out
I noticed a glass pane of my curio cabinet was broken and center pane is MISSING.   I will have to replace.   Can you help?  Clinton and his  crew were MORE than helpful.  I would use your company again.  Please address my glass pane issue.<//review>

Update 1/20/21: After unpacking and sharing a document with all of the damaged and broken items from the move, Wes and the Qshark owner offered a significant sum to make things right by us and to cover some of the damages. This was in addition to the partial refund for the move. This demonstrated to me that QShark cares deeply about their customer's experience. I appreciate they did what they needed to make the situation right.

--

Update: I've been working with Wes at QShark who has been very responsive in helping to resolve the situation. As we unpack we'll be in contact with them on the damages, and they will be refunding us a large portion of the initial cost.

---

I struggle to put into words how truly terrible our experience was. But I'll try—unprofessional, damaging and heartbreaking. I do not wish it upon any one. It took me just over two weeks to even write this review, because every time I think about it it makes me so upset.

*Here are the low lights*:

They advertise that they will come prepared with boxes to help you pack, and all you need to do is pay for the boxes you use. This is not true—they do not come with boxes for purchase and they were clearly not interested in helping pack.

When they arrived and saw we still had some things which needed packing, they asked who was going to do it... I reminded them that that's why we hired them. They said "ok, all good. It's fine".

The only boxes they had come prepared with were MASSIVE (probably around 5 feet tall) wardrobe boxes. All we had left in the house to pack were things from the kitchen (glasses, plates, etc.) and other smaller items (ex: table lamps, audio equipment). Sometimes they placed our items in these massive boxes carefully, but often it felt like our stuff was just swimming inside the boxes, banging against one another.

I communicated to the lead mover, Robert, that we were going to be putting everything into storage in our new home since the house was not yet move in ready. So, I asked if we could keep things like the moving blankets on our designer furniture. He said I'd have to pay for them—$15 each. I said, no problem, I will pay for the blankets and the boxes.

As they were unpacking the belongings into the storage at our new house, we noticed they started unpacking the massive wardrobe boxes they had brought. We alerted them that since it's going into storage, to please not unpack them, and I restated I'd buy the boxes. Robert replied, "No, these are *my* boxes". Not only was everything clanking around inside during transport because they were too big, but they weren't available for me to buy as was advertised.

The same thing then also happened with our DWR furniture which I thought would be inside of the moving blankets. They unpacked them, and now there are scratches all over.

When unpacking, they cantilevered chairs on top of chairs next to delicate items. They placed a table on top of the couch, with stacks of boxes on top of it. All of our belongings precariously stored.

Since we weren't allowed to keep the boxes, many items are just sitting around, completely unpacked. We've already noticed some items are damaged, and I am scared to think what our fragile items and family heirlooms will be like... We bought a mattress cover for the mattress since it'd be inside in the construction area, and once I left, I realized they had removed the cover. So the mattress is now filthy from construction dust.

When they were done, he tried to get me to sign a customer satisfaction document. I felt extremely uncomfortable and pressured and intimidated by him to sign. I told him I was unhappy with the way things turned out, and he reminded me that they are professionals. I signed the first line, and then immediately crossed out my signature and wrote that I was unhappy and refused the sign the rest. He stormed out angrily.

*Positives*:
The crew under Robert were nice guys. They certainly intended well, but given the poor leadership, it was clear there was no quality bar they felt they needed to meet.< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Qshark was great! Roger, Robbie, Mario and Adrian were fantastic and we actually needed to use the company twice to move our entire house from San Diego to the Palm Desert area. (A sign we have too much stuff?) The guys were friendly, polite, strong, professional and efficient. Everything was wrapped well, they came with enough padding, shrink wrap, wardrobe boxes and tape. We had patio furniture on the top patio of our house, which they, without any fuss, diligently worked hard to get it down and into the truck. Thankfully, unloading was easier into our single story house. The move couldn't have gone better! I highly recommend Qshark for any move big or small.< /Review>< pictures>

QShark did exactly as they promised to make things right. I believe that they are a 5 star moving company - top tier. Although I had some problems this time, I believe overall they have great movers and are willing to resolve any issue that is caused during the move.

QShark is a very ethical company and they deserve continued business. They even went out of their way to follow-up with me 7 days later. I highly recommend Qshark moving for any moving need.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Qshark is IT! I had to be moved into my new place by 6pm. I had some concerns about them being able to do it since they weren't able to arrive until 3 pm. Not only did they manage to do it, they did it with 12 mins to spare with zero damage. I was in complete AWE at how quick and efficient they were. George and Rudy were STELLAR! Both were professional and personable. Although I didn't end up needing it, management did offer to store whatever wasn't moved in by 6pm overnight at no additional cost and returning the next day to finish the move. Appreciated how they were solutions oriented. They were also the lowest price across 5+ movers I called in the area. 10/10 recommend!</review>< pics>

<Text>We ran into couple issues when we used their services. I had a broken coffee table and with a floor lamp but I was approached by Wes right away, he resolved the issue with a lightning speed. We got all of our money paid for the moving back which is more than enough for both the items. I already got the lamp and the table is on its way as well. Wes was very respectful and understanding, he didn't just resolve the issue but also came all the to my apartment to deliver the check so I can have the money as soon as possible. I would definitely trust their commany and would use their services for future as well. HIGHLY ENCOURAGE AND RECOMMEND QSHARK.</Text>< Date>

<Text>We were recommended these movers from friends who had just moved. They did a good job and the movers were very friendly and efficient. However, when we unpacked in our new home (less than 5 miles away), we discovered a few items missing. Luckily, they were not super valuable, but I expected all the items to make the move. We contacted the company and while they have been responsive, there's been no answers a month later. The items were too large for a regular box, they were packed from a closet by the movers. They were going to another job after ours so I figure they ended up at someone else's house or the moving company threw them out. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this company.

Edit: I’ve updated this review. They have searched for the lost items and reached out to me to work on replacing the items.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Used them for my move as they were highly rated on google. No extra surprise fees, my whole move was $267, or $89 an hour, nothing added to it (no extra box fees, gas, taxes, etc). They confirmed the move and answered the phone when I called.  For those of you looking, they are good and solid, nothing broken or scratched.  I don't get anything for recommending them, this is to help you out like these reviews helped me out.</review></record>

Well, my name is Sarah, and Q Shark did come late because of some issue, but they made everything right in the end, and Micheal did pick up the phone to help keep me updated through the whole ordeal. The two guys , Ed and Joe, were just so nice and helpful, and so overall I'm very happy and don't mind at all. These two moving guys were so fun and cheerful, it was really a pleasure to have them help me. They did everything right, and took their time to help. Thank you to Ed and Joe who worked until 11:30! You guys were life savers, and I so appreciate your kindness.</Review>

<text>We had never hired movers before, but after a pretty terrible accident I can't carry anything up or down stairs and my husband and I both work 50+ hrs a week so moving was gonna be a bit difficult... So we did some research and chose Qshark to move the majority of our upstairs apartment to our new downstairs apartment. I didn't know what to expect but I was absolutely blown away. Evan AND Javier were on time, courteous, friendly, respectful, professional and cleaned up after themselves. They made what has been a very stressful situation feel so easy. They wrapped all of my furniture and were very careful with our boxes which is a sigh of relief because we own alot of antique glassware. I cannot sing their praises enough.... I am so glad we hired movers and that it was Javier and Evan that showed up. I would highly recommend giving these guys a call. Oh and they were relatively inexpensive and when you are moving in these uncertain times excellent service at a lower cost it exactly what we all need.
If I could give more than 5 stars I totally would!!!!
Thanks guys, I definitely owe y'all a beer or two after moving the heaviest mattress in the world and a full fridge, lol. You guys are the best!!!!!<//text>< user_name>

We used Q Shark moving twice. Each time they have been absolute professionals! Clinton and Alex helped us on this last move and they were amazing. They took great care with our furniture and wrapped each piece in order to insure that there would be no damage. True professionals . . . they exceeded expectations, worked efficiently yet carefully, and were respectful and polite. I wouldn’t even consider a different moving company when it comes to my next move! Q Shark is the only way to go! Ask for Clinton and Alex! Great team!< /Text>

This company and its employees deserve the five star rating they get. Cody and Adrian were the guys helping me move from my home into a storage unit. From the minute they arrived until the moment they left, they were hardworking, professional, extremely personable and respectful. It's nice to trust in the people moving your stuff knowing they are being careful but also efficient. I can't recommend this company enough as well as these two workers specifically. Thank you, Cody and Adrian, for all your hard work. And thanks to Qshark Moving Company!<//review>

What a relief. These guys were super friendly and professional. They finished super fast. The last movers broke both of my beds and had the pieces all over the place. They found all the pieces and put both beds together, as well as the couches. They just were really good at their job. I will definitely use this company again and recommend them to all my friends. Great job guys, thank you.</review>

AWESOME STAFF! Thank you for helping us move! You guys were so quick and helped us move everything into our storage unit and we had SO much stuff. Your team got the job done fast and also cared for our things. They wrapped up everything fragile and made sure everything was safe and secure. We also gave you guys the wrong address and you guys didn’t even get mad and we’re so understanding and friendly! I definitely recommend Qshark Moving Company. Ask for Corbin and Corey they are an awesome team, fast, and efficient.

<Text>Our experience with QShark Moving was great! Wes was the person who helped me with all the bookings, he is super friendly and gives a really good initial impression of the company, in explaining the services and setting it up it really seemed like he had our best interest in mind (and really was there for us on the actual moving day where their was a lot of back and forth dialog). We ended up using 2 Movers and it was led by Clint. They were on-time (literally ahead of schedule ready to be at our house, they offered to start early if we wanted), really friendly, and of course took great care in packaging and moving our stuff. Really great getting to know them throughout the day, and got all of our stuff moved in one piece. We initially had quotes from 2 other companies, and QShark was significantly less in terms of cost but honestly felt like we got a much better customer service and experience than we would have with the others. We have already recommended them to 2 other people and only used them 2 weeks ago. Really appreciate all they did in helping us move, and hope that Wes and Clint both get some props, these guys are the best!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Eugeny and Jose from QShark were excellent movers! They were quick and efficient and got the job done swiftly and carefully. What I liked about using this company is when I called a real person answered on the first try and they were able to answer all my questions. Eugeny and Jose came packed with a variety of tools that helped make my move very successful. First time using this company but will definitely use again and recommend.< /review>

Clinton, Kevin and Dillon moved us out of our 4 bedroom home on 9/6/19 and they were awesome! They were on time, efficient and friendly. They didnt hesitate to get right to work as soon as they arrived, they clearly knew what they were doing.
There was nothing damaged, nothing missing, it was a perfect move. We had a ton of stuff so their efficiency was really appreciated. We would definitely recommend them and use them again!<//Review>

George and Michael were  amazing.
Fast, careful and very friendly.
They were very careful. Not a single item damaged at all. Great with our pets, too.
We highly recommend them!< /Text>

<review>We decided during quarantine, that this would be a great time to move. I went through Thumbtack and carefully read through tons of companies and reviews, and I stumbled across QShark. Their pricing was comparable to other companies, but the reviews were superior to all others. A week or so prior to our move date, I went ahead and booked with them. They confirmed everything over the phone and via email as well. The Called the night prior to our move go confirm everything. They didn't charge us any differently for a Sunday during memorial day weekend either, which really surprised me. The morning of, they called me an hour and a half prior to our start time, letting us know they'd be arriving at approximately 10:45am for our 11am time slot.

I met them downstairs as they wore masks for social distancing, Anthony and Eugene were our mover helpers! They filled out the start time as 10:55am and got to work right away.

They graciously worked with us and all of our things. I explained that since it was a short move(5 miles), I didn't need everything wrapped, just the dressers, fridge, tv stand and Rocking chair. They happily obliged. They worked at an even pace start to finish. They followed behind us at our new place, and due to spacing, they couldn't quite fit through the driveway. They made the trips back and forth getting all of our furniture in our new home.

I want to stop right here and say this: Never once did these guys complain about a single thing. They were the nicest, kindest people we could have asked for in this move. Moving can be stressful, but these guys took that all out of the equation.

Anyways, back to moving in. They were so quick to offer to jump in any time I maybe wanted to rearrange something because it fit a little better over there. They even took our couch apart and door off the hinge so our couch could fit in a certain room.

They out everything exactly where I asked them to. They treated myself and my husband with so much respect. These guys are honestly the only people I would allow to help me move again. They listened to me, heard what I asked, and did it joyfully. They're hard workers and I never saw them stop for anything.

Total cost: $428 for 4 Hours, 15 minutes for a Sunday rate of $89/hour and the $50 fuel fee.

As this was a long drive to our initial location, there was a $50 fuel fee but this was discussed prior to my booking their services.

I had NO last minute additional costs. They didn't add a single thing to our move or try to be sneaky at the end.

They're genuinely nice, hard working guys and I'd be happy to have them back next time, and to recommend them to anyone else moving.</review>< pics>

<Review>Matt, Igor, and Mikhail worked like crazy for a 14 hour long move with two trips back and forth. Great guys, took good care of our stuff, and we're patient as we figured out how to take the freezer drawer out and put the laundry equipment on pedestals.

SO HAPPY TO HAVE JOEY & CARLOS MOVE US! This was our first time hiring movers, and we had no idea what to expect. They are magicians! (And machines - holy cow) So grateful to them for getting us through today. Very polite and friendly, super fast and thorough. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience.</Text>

<Text>Vlad & Anthony did a great job, very professional and paying attention during the packing as well the unpacking.
They assembled nicely all the furniture and did no damaged any wall even if the big furniture was barely fitting the stair.
Great job, highly recommended !

The 2 young men were pure gentlemen
You don’t see that everyday...
Dion and Daniel were very professional polite and conscientious.
I would use this moving service again if we could ask that our movers be both Dion and Daniel.

Qshark was able to schedule a last minute move for me, a day in advance, after my original movers failed to show. Hank and Joey were very professional, efficient, and great to work with. Their moving prices are VERY reasonable, especially given the short notice I gave them.

I highly recommend Qshark for all your moving needs!< /text>

<Text>Deon and George helped me make a stressful day into one of ease. Though everything else that could go wrong today these guys were prompt, professional, and efficient. If I had to do another move I would use these gentlemen again. So if you find yourself between a rock and a hard place with an upcoming move, call Qshark and ask for Deon and George.

Part II Matt and Daniel helped move my storage unit into my house. They both lived up to the standards set by the previous movers. Thus proving the excellent service this company has shown to be the standard.

10/10 hiring them again for my next move.< /Text>< pics>

I’m a property manager and I deal with movers on a more constant basis - so my standards were already high to begin with. QShark Moving Company was really easy to deal with and it was low stress from the start. They were also very responsive which is part of the reason why I wanted to leave a positive review. They followed up with me after reserving the date and time via email text and call. Sent a text the morning of and they were on time. Dylan and DeJuan was great, careful and fast. I would recommend this company to anyone including to my residents.< /text>

<Text>I won't be using this moving company again. The movers that showed up wasn't really that experience. It took them 3 hours to move everything form my 2 bedroom apartment to their truck. I had everything all packed and they just had to bring the stuff downstairs. They were working but they just weren't very skilled in the work so they weren't very efficient. When everything was finally packed and ready to go I left first to run some errands while they set off. I saw them pull into a gas station and while I was waiting at the light, I saw one of the movers crossing the street from another store and getting back in the truck. This was about 15-20 mins after I had left. When they arrived to our new place, they kept telling us that our dressers, headboard, and beds  wouldn't fit through the stairs. I insisted that they tried and they just didn't know how to do it. So I ended up having to help them lift and maneuver the space so they can get everything up. Everything fit with the exception of our bed foundation. When it came time to pay, they said it took them an  hour to get to our place. I told them that I saw them stop at a gas station and asked why I was responsible for the time to gas their truck up. The mover insisted that they were only there for 5 mins. I said I saw you walking around as I was running errands before I headed off. The mover finally relented and changed the drive time.
I am very disappointed by the service that we were provided. I read the great reviews on here and decided to give it try. I did not get the same experience that everyone else seems to have gotten. I called the company to speak to someone about the service I received. I left a message on Saturday and still haven't heard back from them. If you're going to use this service, I hope you get the movers that the rest of the reviews talked about and not the movers that I got.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dd2003ffffffff:0x2c491193a0010234< /GmapID><Time>1553188079917< /Time>< Name>

Orange, CA 92868

First time to use a moving company.  Steven and Ben were totally awesome and made my first moving experience a great one .
They called me ahead of time to let me know they were on their way.  They were very helpful and nice. They were very accommodating with my requests on wrapping and protecting my furniture.
I would definitely use them again when I move.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I hired QShark for a local move from PODS into my downtown apartment. Luke and Ujean were fantastic, showed up right on time and got the job done well and fast, even though we had to deal with liked gates at my apartment that required improvising. I really enjoyed having those guys and will call QShark again if I need to move again.< /Review>

I used Q Shark on March 3rd and they were fantastic! They made sure that all of my belongings were safe with moving blankets and plastic wrap. They were also fast and efficient. They even disassembled and reassembled all of my beds. 100% would use their services again! Based out of Rancho Cucamonga.<//Review>

QShark headquarters were fast and response. I worked more with Steve, the manager, in SD as the move got closer.  He was responsive as well and we set up a visual and estimate that helped us plan our day better (we have 2 young kids).

The crew of Bobby, Aaron, Johnny and Miguel were great.  They called when they said they would, arrived on time and got started right away.  They worked from start to finish. They were friendly, patient and kind with my older toddler who wanted to chat about his favorite trains and help them with his own dolly.

It was a long day for everyone but these 4 gentlemen and QShark made the day less stressful. Customer service is fast, they send email confirmations, they don't have any hidden fees, they don't try to upsell you for moving essentials, they dissemble and assemble things as promised They understand how tough moving is and try to make it easier for you! I'd go with and recommend QShark for future moves!<//text></record>

Well some of you may have read my post regarding Q Shark moving. The moving experience was great but there was some charging concerns that caught my attention. We were over charged and on the surface it seemed like this would take a while to rectify the situation. I spoke to several representatives from the company and they assured me it would be handled. A week later nothing. A few days after I received a call from the supervisor ( Kenny) who personally wanted to make sure I received the money back. Kenny offered to come to my home and personally pay the money that we were owed. I will say I was very impressed with his willingness to rectify this on his day off. It’s business like this that will prosper because they put the customers needs first.<//review>

<text>I've used Qshark Movers for my move from Orange County to San Diego. The person on the phone was really professional and explained their hourly rates and Double Drive charge very clearly. Before the move I was worried that my 4 bedroom house would not fit into 1 load but movers came with 26 foot truck and were able to fit everything. The movers were really nice, fast and efficient. They wrapped all my furniture so nothing would get damaged. In the end of the day my total price was less than expected and I was really impressed by the quality of Qsharks service.
I had an excellent experience with Qshark Moving Company and will use them again in the future!<//text><userid>111570240436559012590< /userid><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Макс Кандыбович<//user_name>< Response>

I hired QSHARK moving to help me move and I have to say these guys were amazing!  Vladimir and his parner were very professional and did an exceptional job with everything.  My new house is on a a hill with a steep driveway so they had to push everything uphill.  These guys were very strong and worked very hard.  I am impressed with the work they did and would reccommend them to anyone in the bay area!!!<//Text>

Dejuan Smith and Dylan Venzlaff showed up on-time, were fast and efficient.  They packed our furniture and delivered it without issue.  They were fun to work with and displayed an incredible work ethic.  I would use QShark Movers again in the future.</review>

<Review>We just moved this past weekend and used qshark moving based on all the positive reviews. Hank and Nate were both very professional and quick with getting us packed up and moved into the new complex. Definitely recommend to all my friends and family that will be moving.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dd2003ffffffff:0x2c491193a0010234<//gmap_id>< Resp>

This is the worst moving company in Los Angeles. The trucks are in disarray, the moving equipment is nearly unusable, the workers are highly unskilled and many do not speak english. The bottom line is that this company is the epitome of the saying, " You get what you pay for." Also, many of these reviews are fake. Horrible company so choose wisely and do not let a cheap price fool you. Good luck.< /Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>These guys are the best!  I spoke with Vlad on the phone.  He was very nice, giving me the information I needed without being pushy at all. When I said I needed confirm the reservation with my husband, he just told me to call back when it was convenient.  My husband and I agreed that Qshark would be the best moving company for us to use.  All other companies that we talked with were very vague about details and wanted to provide too many movers with too large a truck for what needed to be moved.  The other companies seemed to have a lot of hidden charges and their estimates were at least double of what Vlad thought the move would cost.  My husband said that the movers, Kelly and Ken, were hard workers and fast.  They were careful when moving the furniture but moved quickly.  My husband was very impressed by how professional Kelly and Ken were. Qsharks is up front and honest.  There were no hidden charges and the move was amazingly easy and very reasonable.  There is no doubt that Qsharks is the one to turn to for a move. We will definitely be calling them for any other moves in our future.</review><rate>5<//rate>< UserId.>

I was moving from one apartment (3rd floor) to a 3-story town-home (all floors ownd by us). They were approximately 10 miles apart, a 13 minute drive. My husband and I had managed to previously move our entire apartment from one 3rd-floor apartment to this old 3rd-floor apartment in about 3/4 hours including driving time.
This job that Qshark gave us took 7 hours.
I was floored- they arrived at 2pm and left around 9/9:30pm. Some things were badly scuffed- others were pristine (I believe a lot of the extra time was from over-protecting some items). When the two gentlemen entered the apartment they said "this shouldn't take long you don't have a lot of stuff" - it's an 800 sq. ft apartment, so absolutely we didn't have much.
By 8pm I asked how much longer, I was told about 30 minutes. Took another hour-ish. It being a three-story town-home, things weren't put on the floor they needed to be (bed and couches were fine, desks and drawers were not). I gave up and told them to just put all the boxes in the living room so I could move them up or down depending on where they needed to go- I couldn't afford the additional time it would take them!
They were obviously fairly tired when they arrived, and I can only imagine the extra stories really sucked when already tired, but this is their job and I was floored at how long it took. I kept asking if I could help- and was told no it's fine.
They were pretty nice in person, decent people, but from being tired and this job taking twice as long as I had really thought it would take, It was insane.
It taking twice as long as I had assumed (if one bedroom took 7 hours, imagine a two or three!) I asked for the price, basically $600. Well I definitely don't have that lying around in bills while moving- so I offered a check (as a business owner I accept checks on a daily basis) and was promptly told they don't accept those- but if I had my debit card they would happily charge me the higher rate. Ha! No! They got their manager on the phone, I explained the length, the cost, the issues, and they took an hour off of the time- which I do appreciate- and OK'd the check as long as they took a photo of my ID, as they have "had issues in the past" with checks.
They did the job, they moved my stuff, but I honestly should have just paid some family friends to do the job and it would have gotten done faster and probably with less hassle / scuffed items.
Then to top it all off- I find out this morning that our TV power cable was accidentally kept by one of the movers. I reached out to one of the movers who had texted me and tried to arrange a time to get it dropped off- which i was then cancelled on last minute. I offered to swing by after work, which they had suggested was a potential solution, and they stopped responding (around noon today). I called their office to ask what to do, and they told me they'd call me back. Still waiting. So I now have no TV at my new place for the second day.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>Terrible moving experience. Lost feet to my dresser and refused to do anything about it and actually asked if I could just buy different feet when it was explained that crate and barrel do not have replacement parts. Also failed to put several pieces together and took 8 hours to move when a similar move last year took 3. They are crooks - look elsewhere.</Text><username>Corey Hall</username>< Pics>

If I could give less than a star I would. With moving companies we looked and looked and considered the groupon but instead of using it we decided to pay full price. Before even having the movers come we decided we would move more than half of the boxes down to our garage for ease for the movers since we live on the third floor. We specifically called and made sure our TVs would be placed in a box so no damage occurs. Well it was a wasted effort because the move from just my treadmill and a few light shelves as well as a couple left over boxes took three hours. That was with help from my fiancé. The TVs themselves wrapped in a blanket and nothing more. They broke a lamp glass with is pennies compared to my tv. Not only did we not get informed of the broken lamp we literally started helping the movers bc even with the help of moving everything to my garage they still managed to make it into a 6 hr job. So not only did I pay for six hours of moving that should have been professionally done. When starting to look around my new place we notices the fragile boxes labeled specifically so nothing went on top of them were on the bottom of the stack of boxes placed. We called the company to explain the situation and they advised to submit a claim. Mind you the company stated they would box the TVs. Well I’m looking at a whopping $150 back! Television sets are no longer 50 pounds they weigh virtually nothing why would the tv not be secured correctly.I appreciate the gesture but hey that’s all lesson learned and no movers from here again. Do not allow them to move anything fragile!< /review>

Took forever. Built my daughter’s bunk bed incorrectly. I noticed it 3 weeks after we moved in when I saw that her bed was sinking in. Put the railing incorrectly.  Now I don’t even know how to fix it. Not using this company for our next move and don’t recommend this company to anyone.<//review>

Someone tried to charge almond milk that added to my coffee. And when I was told that as a customer I can’t tell her that what to do about almond milk extra charge. The barista was arguing with me with no reason at all. I have been coming to this Starbucks for last 7 years and it was the worst experience this evening. There are all great guys working there I saw the barista first time yesterday and I felt like I was their beg my coffee not buying. Bad experience.<//review>

This is a very nice storebox I have always enjoyed coming here because the staff is very friendly and they have wonderful coffee and delicious breakfast or lunch sandwiches.  I really love the pastries when the heat them up. They have quick and easy parking right in front. If you order coffee through the app you don't have to wait in line.</Review>

<review>They have wonderful staff! Of course I have my favorites. Chris, Arby, and Edwin which is no longer there. He was the best thing to ever happen to that Starbucks. I can imagine their numbers dropped a bit after he was so unfairly removed.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Right by the Rose Bowl.  Easy access next to grocery store with huge parking lot to meet your friends before events.  Great last stop before going in.< /text>

I'm upset I used to really like Starbucks until recently. They are thieves. I got and ice blended coffee and. Strawberry ice drink. I paid over 5 dollars for ice with a half a teaspoon of flavor. No more. 5 dollars for ice really!!!</Text>

This Starbucks is tiny and so usually overcrowded, but I always get good service. Tonight was exceptional, though. Why? One word - Arby! Best. Barista. Ever. If you don't know what you what or think you want to try something new, he'll give you a mini "coffee interview" to find out what kind of stuff you like & then mix you up something.

While it IS pretty crowded, most people pick up and go, so if a power outlet is not required for your peaceful existence at Starbucks, you can still set up shop for a few hours. The tables next to outlets are few and usually full when I have come in.</review>

To be honest, I'm not a fan of Starbucks. However, I did try their new dragon drink per recommendation and it was very delicious and helped me make it through the day, lol. Great job star bucks!</review>

My cup of coffee has been very watery,very weak!! not to happy!! After all I spend up to $50  a month, I've been noticing this happening too much lately.Maybe its time. I should just stop spending my money and make a cup at home or even try McDonald's coffee. There I can definitely ask for a fresh cup and they will make it......</Text>

I've been patronizing this Starbucks for over a year and.my experience has been going down hill. My mobile orders are either wrong, late, or not to my liking . I go at least 3 times a week and the customer service is declining... fast!
My order today wasn't made right because I order the same coffee the same way for the last the three years. So yeah, I'm not pleased at all!< /Review>

I only go to Starbucks if i have a gift card.  Which i get often because I'm a teacher.  So what i like. Most of the time the staff is very pleasant good  customer service,  I'm not a coffee drinker.  I only get frappeccinos with almond milk.  I like that it is offered there. When i get more gift cards i will be back .< /Review>

I made an order and presented a $50 bill. My cashier ask the cashier next to her could he break the $50 bill. The young man quickly said no and kept going and doing what he was doing. I gladly ran out to the car, got my credit card came back in to pay and noticed the same young man making change for another customers $50 bill. When I asked him what was the difference between my $50 bill and the other customers $50 bill he had no answer except for I didn't know I had change.
This was pure nonsense as he had just stepped into work with a full cash drawer. After contacting the manager she confirmed his door was full and tryed to answer by saying we do not give change for $50 bills. So my question is still why was my $50 bill different than the ladies $50 bill. Oh... did I mention that I'm black and the other customer was a nice Caucasian lady? so once again we're faced with nonsense that didn't have to happen and didn't have to make me think race had anything to do with it. Albeit, it's certainly felt like that. The manager did not know what to do or say but after I told her I was a Google reviewer she quickly asked to pay for my coffee. Oh well, another day Living in this beautiful country.< /Review>

The baristas at this location are SO NICE. This Starbucks is my neighborhood coffeeshop, so I come here a lot to study. I know at least 2 of the baristas by face (would be name, except I'm so terrible with names and they don't always have nametags-- shoutout to the girl who calls me honeybun, she's the sweetest ever). Drinks are always great, and they're wonderful about replacing them if I ever don't like one. I'm usually not one for chain coffeeshops (I really like independent neighborhood coffeeshops), but this feels like an extension of home for me. I'm going to be sad when I move down to San Diego and won't be able to come here every week. 😢< /Review>

Was in a rush, and the line was wicked long, so it really great to know that it was a priority that the mistake of the printer was accounted for.

As a side note, the paper supplier should have a warning on the label paper letting the user know it’s running low.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Greatest Starbucks I have ever been too.  Kamren Contreras always makes my drinks and he is so friendly and always happy.  He brightens my day, all the time.  Fast service, and calls me by name.  Makes me feel good that in this busy, bustling world, some people still have that Honesty and take the time to always greet a customer, no matter how busy he is. I hope Starbucks recognizes him and hires more like him.  Greatest place for Coffee and a light snack everyday!!!! Keep it up Kamren! You are doing it.< /Review>

Update: they've redone the interior seating & it's a great improvement!

It's just laid out poorly. The outdoor seating faces the busy Vons parking lot,  and the umbrellas do little to protect from the glare of the sun.  This is the least comfortable Starbucks I've ever been to.

A inside, the seating is also poorly laid out. In all fairness, they've had to work with a small space...however, the workers are generally friendly and polite.< /Review>

Normally I love this store but when Mitch is working it's so annoying.... he loves the sound of his own voice.... I don't know how his co-workers stand  it.  If he's not singing over the music he's talking or whistling... tell him to get his attention on his own time... it's not the Mitch show, shut up!</Text>

This is not a good Starbucks. I don't get how they can mess up an esspresso but they did. I ordered 2 shots and they tasted like coffee or an Americano. I went back asked to remake and the person who took the order was nice but the person who made the drink was a little rude about it. 'well how do you want it'

WTH- just esspresso, in a cup.</review>

Typical Starbucks. Enjoyed my frappucino & sandwich. Staff was truly friendly & helpful. I'd go back to this location. However parking can be a bit difficult becuz there's Vallarta Mkt to one side of the lot & Chase bank next door.</review>

<text>I placed a mobile order and when I got there and asked for it the barista answered rudely that she didn't know. Then walked away and when she came back said it didn't print out. It wouldn't have bothered me so much except she made no effort to apologize and she had a bad attitude the entire time.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>I have been a long time client of his Starbucks location, until a few weeks ago  when I was ordering and one of the baristas was awfully rude to me.  I guess she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on me. She was not listening to my order so she got the size of the cup wrong.   I said sorry but I asked for a Venti cup please. She immediately threw the cup behind her in a very dramatic way and looked at me mad.
There was a huge line behind and I imagine they all saw this, I was so embarrassed. I came back to my office and sent out an email to corporate about the incident. Until this day I have not heard back from them.<//Review>< pictures>

<rating>4< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) Great service and amazing coffees. I do not know what else I can tell you since in franchises as it is, the service is excellent and very common in all the establishments of the chain. I will not tell you what to order as you already have your favorite, enjoy!
