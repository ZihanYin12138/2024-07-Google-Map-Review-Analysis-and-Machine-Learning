Showed up this morning for a no appointment smog check. I was happily surprised they started work on it right away. They gave me the option to remove my Porsche engine cowling myself to save money  or have them do it. They were very helpful and fast. I was in and out in 30mins. A+ highly recommend. They also have a very nice waiting area for a small shop.< /text>

<Text>Service was fine and quick enough. More expensive than others. But the two start rating is for the lack of masks for all the workers. In the time of COVID, health professionals are asking that people wear masks. I was told by one of the employees that "they clean everything and wearing a mask is difficult." COVID spreads by respiratory droplets, so great, you clean things, but if you want to protect your customers and your workers, please wear masks. As a health professional who is taking care of COVID patients, trust me, being on a ventilator is a lot more difficult than wearing a mask. In the future we will find a different place for our car services, one that cares about their workers and patrons.< /Text>< Pics>

I always take my car here since about 2010, first was my Dad's old wagon and now my 2016 KIA. They all are so nice and timely and their pricing is fair. For example, I need a new air condenser so I went to the Dealership and they wanted to charge me $900! At  Four Star they quoted half of that. So I do recommend them.<//text>

this company was fast and efficient with my smog. the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly willing to answer any questions you might have. the only difficulty I noticed was when I left, I had to back out of their location, I am glad that the street was empty at the time I backed out onto it.< /Review>

I needed to get a smog check done on my vehicle.  The only time I had available to take my car in was during my 15 minute break or during my lunch hour.  When I called to find out if they had availability, the person on the phone was not only super nice,  but he said I can go in anytime and he would get me out of there in 15 minutes.  I was very doubtful because this never happened at any other place I've been.  I took my car in and as soon as I arrived, they did the smog check and gave me a discount.  I was truly out of there in 10 minutes and made it back to work in time.  They were amazing and I am recommending them to friends, family and co-workers.  Thank you!!!!</review>

Had to get my car towed to the shop and never dealt with them before not to mention that I don't even live there. Jose took very good care of me and I appreciate it.  Thanks to you and your team.<//Review>

<text>I needed to get rid of an old working television so I thought it might be a good idea to donate it.  It's rather large (70") so I wouldn't be able to bring it to a local charity as I don't have a truck.  I called about 10 different charities and none of them would come and pick it up. Sadly, I had no choice but to junk it. I came across Junk King while doing a Yelp search and decided to get a quote. The person on the line was very nice and professional and even honored the discount stated on the website even though I didn't book online.  On the day of the appointment I received a call from Art that they were on their way and they were here in literally 5 minutes!  Plus, they arrived shortly after the start of their designated window. I hate services that give you a window, which forces you to wait, and then either they come towards the end of the window or sometimes after the window. Causing me to waste my time. This process was smooth from start to finish and their prices are reasonable.  I would recommend them for your all your junk removal needs!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Art and his helper were amazing. The final price was higher than estimated but we figured it would since we are on second floor. Fair price still. They called me ahead when they were on their way, helped to plan my day and they were on time. Overall, great experience.< /Text>

They actually showed up early for our appointment (such a treat!) and were so quick about getting everything cleaned out for us! We are in the process of converting a guest room into an office so we had a lot of stuff to get rid of and my garage was literally overflowing with everything that needed to be taken away.

I contacted Junk King for removal of an old couch and table. They were able to accommodate an appointment the very next day. The service agent was thorough and very knowledgeable and met my appointment time needs. The cost was reasonable when compared to other junk removal companies. The two young servicemen arrived within the time window I expected. They wore facial masks and business uniforms, which is nice and professional. They were done hauling my sofa & table in less than 15 minutes. I will definitely be using them again! I recommend Junk King for your junk removal needs.< /text>

We’ve used Junk King 3 times now, out of their San Fernando location. Their prices are average, and you might be able to find cheaper, but you won’t match their responsiveness, speed of service, or professionalism. Always a great team.</Text>

They were right on time and called 10 minutes before they were going to arrive to let us know they were coming. Upon arrival, we showed them what we wanted taken and they gave us a reasonable estimate. Then they started taking things down and we were done. Fast and efficient. They were also safe and wearing masks and protection gear. Painless and easy! We highly recommend!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I called several places to pickup and haul junk stored in my garage, most of them gave me an estimate by looking at a picture and they were pretty steep from $500 and up. The city will hauled away for free , but not at once so, it would of taken weeks to moved away from my front yard. Junk King responded within an hour and set up an appointment to actually see the junk and gave me a quote that was negotiable. They were professional and cleaned all my junk within half hour. I thank them for their professionalism and will keep them in mind to refer them to friends and neighbors.<//Text>< pics>

We had a large truckload of trash to remove, but we have a long driveway that wouldn't accommodate the big truck, so they used a pickup truck to move everything to the big truck - basically loading things twice. They did all of this for a reasonable price, and were on-time, polite, complete, and cleaned up/swept after they were done. They wore face masks. Couldn't ask for better!<//Text>

We booked appt online for 8am -10am on a Saturday morning. Kevin called just before 8am giving us a 15-20 minute ETA. When Kevin and his partner (sorry, didn’t get his name) arrived, they were friendly and courteous and promptly removed our old broken refrigerator. Thank you to Junk King. As an added bonus, they were about $40 cheaper than their competitors!<//text>

Needed to remove a pile of debris in my backyard...concrete, light fixture, etc. Got two quotes. One from 1800-gotjunk (who are great) and then JunkKing. JK was a little bit cheaper. They were great! On time, kind, professional.<//Review>

Very happy with my experience. Had a bit of a miscommunication with the price but they honored the price I was quoted. They even had an issue with not having the right tool to get the door off the refrigerator and the manager came down to address the issue himself which I thought was a nice touch. I actually had the tool they needed so it worked out well in the end.</Text>

Moving can always be stressful, especially if you have things you want to dispose. Junk King came to my home looked over my items and gave me a fair price to remove the items. They took everything I asked them to take. Fast, and professional cleanup.

I would definitely recommend their services and i would use them again!!< /Text>

<Review>I can hardly find the words to express how highly I recommend Art and his crew. I have used them several times for very large, dirty and labor intensive jobs. They are  professional who take their work seriously. Arrive on time, listen and communicate. All the crew members I have dealt with are extremely respectful and courteous and hard workers who get the job done as quickly as possible. The price also beats some of the more highly advertised competitors like Got Junk so it's a win win.</Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Response>

I would recommend Junk King to get rid of that old spa you never use or is falling apart. We had ours removed today and could not be happier with their professionalism. They showed up on time, were efficient in their work, and the price was right. Thanks guys for giving us part of our yard back!<//Review>

The team at Junk King was fabulous! They responded immediately to my initial text, called to say they were on their way, arrived promptly, and were in and out quickly. Very friendly and excellent service. I highly recommend them!!< /text>

Raul and his team were friendly and efficient. They were able to pick up a pretty good sized load in less than a half hour. I would use Junk King again.< /Text>

<review>Very pleaeed with their service! Our time was 12-2. They called at 10:15 and said they could come then. They arrived in 15 minutes. Both gentlemen shook my husband's hand and picked up some very bulky furniture like they were pick up sticks. Very personable and accommodating.  We will use them again for a piano disposal and more.< /review><Response>None< /Response><rating>5</rating>< Gmap_id>

<review>I am so grateful to all your customer service reps and two young men that were assigned the task of emptying out my Public Storage unit. They were courteous and Fantastic. I had to leave for a short time for a Doctors appointment and by the time I got back they informed me it might take 2 trips to complete the task and I just told them to do whatever they need to do to make it work. Got a call few hours later, said storage unit was totally empty and they swept up whatever residual and job complete. Can't express how grateful I was because I'm having knee replacement surgery tommorrow and I would end up being incapacitated for a few months. Will  definately refer your company to all my friends and thanks again for the GREAT customer service.<//review><Name>Sue Cahoon</Name></record></dataset><record>

Fast response as well as service. Booked my appointment online about 4 days before they arrived. They showed up with a team of guys to remove this heavy juicer from my boss’s house that I couldn’t give away. Within five minutes and $75 later, it was out of my hair and the guys promised they donate materials they haul and would sure find a home for it. Friendly and prompt service, will definitely recommend them and use them in the future.</Text>

Other "junk removal" companies I called quoted anywhere from $150 up to over $300 (which is CRAZY)
Luckily I found Junk King, easily booked online and I saved a ton of money. When I met the guys at the house they were courteous, answered all my questions, and they got the job done in about 5 minutes so I could get back to work.
Payment was simple (they took a credit card via a mobile device). Plus I found out they donate or recycle the items they pick up so it isn't just ending up in a landfill.
Thank you Junk King! We'll be using you again for sure!< /Text>< pictures>

Your team came over yesterday and we workout an agreement very quickly and when they showed up this morning on time they finished very quickly and the work was done very well.

Thank you, all night

<Review>I paid $300 for a pickup the city would have done for free (bulky item pickup). I didn’t understand that the negotiated price was what I would pay, I thought you would pay me for items that have value. Very frustrating. We put all them items by the street.< /Review>< Date>

Brad at the AT&T in the stony point plaza in Santa Rosa, CA is the best customer service I have ever experienced at any of your establishments. He deserves a managerial job as well as a raise. THANK YOU BRAD!</review>

Out of town for work and shattered my s20 ultra. Came in and Jose got me fixed up with a new phone. Made it extremely easy and transfered all my data in no time. Easiest experience I've ever had at an AT&T store by far!</text>

Jose the manager was extremely helpful ! He helped my family set up 3 iPhones and more. He patiently waited for over a couple hours while helping us.

This is our go to stop.</Review>

I cannot reccommend this store enough!! I worked with the store manager Jose and he was so helpful and knowledgeable! My requests were a little complex but he was so patient and explained things in a way that were easy to understand. He was very informative of all the current promotions/upgrades available without being too pushy or overbearing. Nicole was also so sweet and helpful! Even though she wasn’t the representative managing my account today she was still so eager to jump in and assist with getting my new iPhone set up. My experience today really provided confidence in my choice to have AT&T as my cellphone (and soon to be TV) service provider :) Thanks for everything Stony Point Team!< /review>

<Review>I was a Sprint customer and T-Mobile treated us like 2nd class citizens, so I  am THRILLED to switch to AT&T. Juan and his team are wonderful and AT&T costs virtually the same per month on 5 lines, plus they gave us several options for FREE phones when we traded in our old phones. The help in the store is SO MUCH BETTER than the old Sprint and T-Mobile and the cost is MUCH less than Verizon for unlimited plans.< /Review><GmapID>0x80843821abf5f5e3:0x3150fe07639baefb<//GmapID>< time>

I use to think this store was great, great service, many products to choose from. Then about 3 weeks ago we took our daughter in to take her off of our account and get her own account. She had already picked her prepaid plan and was keeping her phone, so it should have been a simply process. We were going told that she would have to get a more expensive plan because the plan she wanted was no longer available and would have to get a new number. What, why? The sales rep did some fast talking and before we knee it the deal was done. When we got home my husband called AT&T to discuss what had transpired and found out the plan she wanted was available and no she didn’t need to get a new number. So she now has a plan that is double what she wanted and had to I get a number.

A week later my phone quit working (with 2 payments left in it) we went back, already knowing if we saw that rep we would leave. He wasn’t there and a woman helped us. We had already talked to AT&T and knew that I could get an iPhone 11 for $300 off. We went in sat down and was ready for o pay off my old phone ($50) to get the $300 off on the iPhone. We were told that we were not eligible for that special because we didn’t have the “right” plan, and we would have to switch our plan to a more expensive plan to get the deal. We said no we are happy with our plan, so they said if we were willing to leave them my old phone the balance in that phone would pay off and my new payments are will start (same monthly payments). I am very happy with my new phone until we opened our bill. There is no credit off for my old phone, so my husband calls them again and tells them what we were told at the store. He was told that the $300 off on the iPhone 11 is good on ALL plans you just need to turn in your old phone in good condition, and it should have been honored. It is a monthly deduction off the payments but it still is now $15 per month instead of $25.

So now they have lied to us twice to get us to spend more money. This is unacceptable. We will no longer be going to this location. I would rather wait an hour at Santa Rosa Ave. They have always been honest with us.</Text>

AT&T. We all love the occasion when you can’t just avoid human contact and you absolutely must go into a retailer to deal with... Dare I say it... People!!!

Well. Calm down and take a breather because this store here? It makes for a great experience. I was greeted at the door with a smile and Leo -the manager- is so knowledgeable. I am that customer that asks a million and one questions and this guy didn’t even hesitate to answer all of my inquiries.

He has the store looking sharp, directed me to some awesome accessories and helped me get the right phone and plan for me and my family. What a great experience. 10/10 recommended. The other guys there also were helpful and friendly.< /text>

I want to start by saying thank you Jennifer, you and the rest of your crew were so friendly! My husband and I came in recently to switch our service from metro to att, bringing over three lines and adding another! I can honestly say that while there were a few technical issues( her tablet was being very naughty😂) she made absolute sure that everything was perfect for us. She found us the absolute best deals and gave us honest opinions. Also, they all put up with my husband and I which is quite a task on its own! 👍😂 Thank you again, our phones are great and our service is even better!<//review>

<Review>I was very happy with my recent service when switching over to AT&t from Sprint. the signup process was fast and easy every question I had was answered. Jennifer the young lady that helped me made sure I understood every term of the contract, how to use my device, when my billing cycle would be, etc. I have since received a phone call from her asking if I had been satisfied with my service thus far, asking if I'm satisfied with my phone, and reminding me that they are there to help me should I wish to exchange or return my new device.
it feels good to finally find a carrier that exemplifies customer service and that leaves me feeling like the money I'm spending is worth it to them.
I would highly recommend that if you are looking to drop your current carrier, you check out what AT&T at 469 Stony Point Rd, Santa Rosa, has to offer, ask for Jennifer I highly recommend her.< /Review><gmapID>0x80843821abf5f5e3:0x3150fe07639baefb< /gmapID><Rate>5</Rate>< Time>

<Date>1602797154600< /Date><Rate>1<//Rate><text>Went in to upgrade the family phones. Daughter and Sister in law were allowed to purchase inexpensive phones and turn them in immediately for the thousand dollar upgrade credit being offered, but my son was not (he came in ten minutes later). Instead, he was told that he had to wait 14 days, and would not be allowed to purchase the phone outright (as the other two did). We come in 14 days later, and are told that the thousand dollar credit program is no longer available, and that we should have done what the other two did, and that now the credit is only $700 (plus the amount for the payoff of the phone). The manager of the store tells s that here is nothing that he can do, as it is out of his hands (despite the problem being caused by his employees in his store). He promises to speak to his supervisor to get a $300 credit to make up for this.

Now, seeing this month's bill, we are being charged the full amount for those phones, rather than getting the thousand dollar credit for each, or even the $700 credit, much less the "possible" $300 credit that he promised to speak to his supervisor about.

Let me strongly warn you away from the ATT store at 3rd and Stony Point in Santa Rosa, California, or, if you choose to go there, bring vaseline.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I’ve been a loyal customer with AT&T for about twenty years but I always dread the rare occasion of having to go in the store (I am not tech savvy nor do I care for phones), but this was a refreshing encounter. An employee who is knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and overall a pleasure to come in contact with in this time of social-distancing...and the award goes to Jenn! She goes above and beyond in her duties and I hope the higher-ups make note of the potential she has and recognize her for it!

<text>The AT&T store on Stonypoint Road by the CVS is more than wonderful it’s not real crowded and you get waited on immediately. Even with this virus going around I’ve had to go in there and the people are more than willing to wait on me, even with a smile and they take care of everything that needs to be done with out any complaint.. I used to go down to the Santa Rosa Ave. store because that’s how I felt there but this is right by our house and they are just as wonderful and just as competent and very respectful. It’s old time service in a new time atmosphere. Thank you!< /text><user_id>107917414965797235485< /user_id>< rate>

They answered all my questions and were very helpful too though am so disappointed with AT&A for charging me three time because of the mistake that was made by their representatives of Santa Rosa plaza branch who are so selfish not putting the client's needs first so whoever wants to join AT&T only go stony point branch< /review>

(Translated by Google) Very good service in this store, I attended the AVE branch. Santa Rosa, very bad attention, they did not solve my doubts, I went to the branch of the mall in the center and the person who attended us very simply did not explain anything, and when going to this totally different stony point store since I entered good kindness, very good presentation, And when I asked, they solved my doubts and gave me a better offer, thank you very much to manager José for his personalized attention.

I was referred to see Dr. Wyzkykowski.  I called Monday, last week, to make an appointment and provided my primary and secondary medical insurance information. The clerk verified all the information and made me an appointment the following Monday (today). Last Friday, Muir Ortho called me close to 4:00 pm to let me know that they are not part of my primary insurance network. I ask them about my secondary insurance, Military TRICARE (which they accept by the way). They said that TRICARE needed prior approval before getting seen. I asked then why they waited on the last minute to inform me and why they didn't ask for a prior approval from TRICARE. They said that somebody will get back with me that afternoon, which no one did.  I immediately tried to contact TRICARE but they were already closed for the weekend.  I showed up for my appointment on Monday and explained the whole scenario to them but to make the long story short, they would not see me unless I pay cash.  Below are my questions:
1. Why would you confirm that my two medical insurance are good, make me an appointment, and then later tell me that you are not part of my primary insurance network?
2.  Why wait on the last minute to inform me of the situation?
3.  After finding out that my primary insurance is not accepted by your clinic, why didn't you contact TRICARE to get a pre-approval? OR contact me earlier so I can do it myself?
I know that you are the only clinic with hand specialists in Brentwood but not having any competition is not an excuse for such a lousy delivery of care.<//text>

It was brief and to the point my only contention is that couldn't just have been done without me having to have driven over an hour from Concord Concord to Brentwood electronically just as they did it as I was in the office that's my only point of contention I do appreciate the fact that the refer refer not the referring position but the physician to whom it was referred to for the cortisone shot called within 48 hours and for that I thank you my cortisone shot is set for tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. so overall thus far I say it was a positive experience for the most part but I would recommend to all to ask many questions especially if something doesn't make sense to you< /Text>

Dr Schilling is the best. He is very professional, polite and caring. He always explains the procedure even though he explained it to me before. I always have the injection twice a year at least and he remembered me. The staff in the clinic are all professional and courteous.</text>

Then last year I broke three bones in my ankle going down a ravine and was told by three doctors I had really mangled it.  Once again, Dr. Moorthy worked his magic.  I have another plate and pins however everything is working as it should.
I also want to give a shout out to Muir Orthopaedic Specialists personnel; office workers, PA’s and surgical personnel, X-ray, Casting, nurses, physical therapists  etc.. I had some special medical needs during both surgeries and all the personnel were “on it” as far as the many changes and questions and care needed to make it all happen with good outcomes.

<text>On December 15, 2020 Dr. Richard Wyzykowski preformed a Carpal Tunnel release on my right hand.  The surgery was 100 percent successful.  I am able to move my hand and fingers better than I have for years.  I would definitely recommend Dr Wyzykowski to folks who are having problems with their hands.  In  fact he will be doing a repeat surgery on my left hand in February.

DR. BADER NEVER GIVING UP AS A DR. SUGGESTED I CONTINUE DOING STRETCHES AT HOME TO KEEP MY SHOULDER FROM GETTING STIFF AND SAID THAT IF STILL HAVING TROUBLE AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS HE WOULD DO SURGERY AGAIN TO GET RID OF THE STIFFNESS AND HAVE FULL MOTION,  THE POINT OF ALL THIS IS "NEVER GIVE UP",  BECAUSE MY DR HASN'T, I JUST WISH THEIR WERE MORE DR'S LIKE HIM AND THEIR IS, DR'S HAVE JUST FORGOTTEN THE COMMITMENT THEY MADE TO US,  IN SAVING AND HELPING HUMANITY.< /text>

I was very satisfied with the results of my hand surgery.  Dr. Schilling was excellent.  I was very comfortable with everything he did.  He took the time to discuss the procedure with me and answered all my questions.  I felt that he tuned into my specific problem and tailored his procedures accordingly.  I   would highly recommend him to any of my friends.</text>

Honestly the worst orthopaedic specialist office ,I have ever been too . The front office is full of rude incompetent people,all of which have bad attitudes .I had mY first appointment  and drove 40 minutes to be there just to be told my appointment was canceled ,I received no calls to tell me my appointment had been cancelled and then one lady in the office gave me an attitude like it was my fault .The doctors don't give any real answers or solutions . Had back pain for 3 months ,went to chiropracter and received xray and meds from PCP . waited for this appointment hoping to get a steroid shot so I can get back to somewhat normal life since I have been unable to walk ,work ,sleep etc. For months just to be told I get no MRI or shot until I complete 4weeks of physical therapy . physical therapy is fine and dandy but how am I moving in the mean time ??? Just ridiculous<//review>

<review>My Husband had an appointment today 10/08/2019 @10:45 am. As asked, he arrived 10 min before his appointment, and he did. He was called up 15 min later for a $20 copay. He was unsure why he needed to pay the copay and told the receptionist hes never paid one before. The receptionist told him she would check and let him know. So he went back to waiting. Well another 30min went by, he got up and asked how much longer (hes now been waiting an 1hr)  He is told it looks like hes the next one for his Doctor. More time goes by. I called the clinic asking about the prolonged wait time. He had been waiting over an hour. The clinic finally tells me hes actually walking back to the room with the Doctor. My husbands phone died as I was on the phone with the clinic so I took their word for it. Well about 25 min later my husband calls me and tells me he was never seen and never called, he had to reschedule his appointment because it was getting late for him to pick up our kids. Its already over his 1 week check up for his fracture and not only does he need paper work done for his insurance, he also hasn't gotten any better. He was scheduled for a week later. Our dead line to turn in and file his paper work is this week. I called the office back to speak to a supervisor about the matter, and to try and get him seen sooner.  I was told they were both on a call and I would get a CB shortly. Its been over an hour since the call and I still have not heard back. This is not the first incident of miscommunication from this facility.</review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

I went with my husband to see Dr. Wyzykowski regarding shoulder pain. The wait time was what you would expect when seeing a physician. The staff was courteous and professional. The doctor explained everything thoroughly in great detail in a language that was understandable. We both left with a feeling of confidence that we made the right decision by choosing Dr. Wyzykowski. In fact after we left the office, I called my brother-in-law to suggest that he make an appointment regarding his shoulder pain.<//Text>

Dr. Wyzkowski was extremely rude and unhelpful for my one year return appointment. I have experienced long wait times as well.</Text>

75 minutes in the waiting room is a joke. This office should start paying people for THEIR missed appointment times. Ridiculous.<//review>

< Review>
Great place to get yogurt and great customer service. The owner is hands on and they even host elementary school tours where the kids learn about yogurt making and they get to go in the back room to see what happens behind the scenes.

The yogurt taste great and I have never had any complaints during my many visits.< /Review>

We’ve been there twice and the woman who runs/owns the place is always super sweet. It really shows how much she loves what she does. Will definitely be our regular froyo spot.</Review>

The staff is always so kind. I have been twice in the past few weeks since I jus moved here. I used to be someone who always went to yogurtland but Menchie's has way more choices and better selection. Menchie's also has tons of toppings that you couldn't get at yogurtland. I love the other merchandise that is not frozen yogurt too, like the t-shirts, plushies, and bags. Everything is pretty adorable! When I visited today, I got a free $5 gift card! They are super awesome! I recommend them and will definitely be going there again soon.<//text>

OMG please keep the new chocolate gelato flavor! 😍 it is so velvety texture and a deep chocolate flavor. The place is nice and clean and staff is friendly. I like that they trust you with the sample cups, I went to a place in riverside where they kept the sample cups behind the counter.<//Review>

I went in two nights in a row. The first night, the girl working there was really nice and made me want to go back. The second night the guy who was working there was a bit standoffish, ate on the job, and left the store for like ten minutes with no one in there but me and my friend? It was weird. Very different experiences for different days I guess.</Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>It was o.k. nice and clean. However I drove out here because Menchies is supposed to have low carb options. I was told by an employee that they haven't even ordered any flavors of those.

Its fine for just froyo. But if you are looking for a Menchies with a low carb option, go elsewhere.</review>< pictures>

I happen to enjoy this location a lot, you never know what they will have here, and it's good to drop off unnecessary items. A little weight off your shoulders, an opportunity for someone in need.<//review>

Obviously this location makes money hand over fist. They only take donations on certain days and only in the morning. So, f'em,  the donation I was going to make goes in the trash. I guess the Goodwill doesn't need your donations. Bye<//review>

<text>Last time I ever donate to a goodwill!!! I donated things that were in perfect condition!!! When I got in the car the man sorting the items threw away 80% of what I donated because he said they were trash! If they were trash I wouldn’t be donating them. Never again will I be donating to good will again because of that man.</text>< user_id>

I cleaned closets of gently used clothing to drop off I was told they had no storage space for more clothing at this time. I went to Salvation Army store on Foothill and Etiwanda by Food 4 Less and found out they dont take furniture.< /Review>

<text>My daughter received a retro-style record player for Christmas and we came here exclusively to find records. We found some good ones, all priced $3.99 or less. Compare that to $30 to $70 retail. All of my kids found toys, despite the reviews saying there were none. I was not expecting any kind of selection, so when I saw all the toys there, I had to post a picture. I got some very nice jeans and saw many name brands like Lucky, Seven, gap, and Hollister. There was also a large selection of new items, mostly housewares. The staff was friendly and polite, again contrary to some of the previous reviews, and I was pleased with the layout of the store, the selection, and the prices.<//text>< Rating>

<Review>Wow, we tried to donate a perfectly good couch and chair, but the lady wouldn't take it because there was a small stain that could have been wiped off with warm water and a washcloth on the side.  Couldn't believe it.   Salvation Army happily accepted them.  This place is stupid.</Review></record></dataset><record>

One of the most notable things about this store is the helpfulness of the team members.  They allow you to look at the jewelry, for example, without hovering over you like a second skin. Team members regularly ask if you need assistance. There are some great new products as well as the usual gently used variety if merchandise for which Goodwill is known. It is a pleasure shopping here. I do recommend that you stop in and browse. You never know when you will find some item you really need.</Text>

Tried to donate a slightly used end table and was told they don't accept damaged furniture. The table was dusty and a few spiderwebs with a small scuff mark. Really Goodwill?? You're accepting a free donations and you're being picky??? How about being grateful for the donation< /text>

This Goodwill is trash. Just like most of them. Unrealistically high prices on garbage. This one should actually be shut down. But I think people do community service here so I'm sure they won't be closing the doors anytime soon. I'm a shame to becuz their selection of everything sucks .I'm not a hater. I genuinely try to see the good in everything but this place is a overpriced trash can. I promise .</text>

<text>Cashier curtly told me I must at all times carry all items I wished to purchase, NOTHING  not even a heavy concrete garden item would be held anywhere in the store while I shopped other items I wished to purchase. Physically, I could not hold this item so I left to shop elsewhere. NO REASONABLE ACCOMODATION FOR MY PHYSICAL DISABILITY.  ADA requires reasonable accomodation for disabilitues-even age related-I am in my mid 70's.  Cashier stated twice that I could not put my item by the checkout area or anywhere in the Goodwill store while shopping.She seemed to enjoy denying me this opportunity.  Why taunt an old lady this way? Shoddy, rude, so unnecessary.  😖 ps. I've never before left a negative review for anything.

For a Goodwill, its very small. You can barely spot this place from the street. Very small selection of men's clothing. Theres a larger section dedicated to furniture than the men's clothing. It is also very difficult to spot this place from the street. A lot of the other businesses next to this Goodwill have gone out of business and looks very eerie.</Text>

With some thrift stores, you gotta weed through a lot of outdated stuff for some decent finds, but with this one, they have a LOT of pretty nice stuff that's current with trends. I was able to find a Gap top, a Kohl's branded top, and Charlotte Russe branded denim shorts, all for 12 bucks. None of these items would have individually retailed for that much. This is what makes thrift stores awesome.< /Text>< Pics>

They now have a black tag. These are specialty items or high end items. As if everything in the store isn't 100% profit anyways. I found a cute pair of short-alls and fall back at the price of $18. I'm going to call Leah Remini</review>< Pics>

I love the cloths, it's a shame how much they charge for a lot of the stuff they get donated. Can't complain though it's better than paying full price<//review>

<review>This Goodwill is located in a somewhat dead shopping complex, I almost didn't find it because I thought it was out of business, but its hiding in there.
This store is medium to large for the average Goodwill, its relatively clean and relatively nicely laid out, but its not as nice as the store closer to the Los Angeles area.
This store had a medium sized section of books, CD's and DVD's and I found an amazing deal in the CD section.
The electronics section is on the small size and it was one of the least organized of the stores I have visited throughout Southern California.
The furniture area and selection was the smallest of any Goodwill I have visited.
The household items consisted of several rows and was on the small size.
Lots of clothing and shoes.
Despite being basically out in the middle of no-where's land - I enjoyed this store, it reminded me of the mid-west and I found both shoppers and employees friendly and even a bit entertaining.
I will visit this store again, on my return trips from the Ontario Headquarters.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>PLEASE READ SO YOU DONT GET RIPPED OFF. never buy from here. they ripped me off. We bought a couch set from there and it said that it had 7 pieces to it. Got it loaded up and when we got back we realized that we only had 5 pieces of it. 2 days went buy because i work alot and we bought it as they were closing that night. Anyways my dad and I went back there to see if we could return it or atleast get store credit. the manager there had horrible customer service. we asked if we could return it for atleast store credit and he said that they dont do that on furniture, which is true in thier policy, but why cant you return something if they didnt and wont give you what you paid for. Very misleading and technically false advertising. He said that he couldnt do anything or help us at all. When we went their the first time a taller skinnier guy helped us and he was very nice and we spoke to an older blonde lady that had great customer service. But the manager couldve totally helped us out in some way shape or form but was lazy and would rather go into his back room and do nothing. Dont waste your time here. Find a better goodwill to go to. i have pictures to prove it and ill try to upload as well.<//Text>< Pics>

< review>
Im a Former employee. Retail. Worst company i have ever worked for. Horrible management that cant be taken seriously. Very poor employee service. Incompetent key holders, assistant manager and managers. Poor pay. Corporate billionares who pocket all the money made from donations so its 100% profit, but the cant afford to turn on the A/C, or at least pay us 1$  more an hour. Management abusing other employees seniority over new associates. Corrupt management having high school drama as a result of being too young and ill equipped of professionalism, sabatoging store asaociates below them by causing reacurruing cash discrepensies, accusing them for mishaps, he said she said, trying to get people fired because "they want to move up", or " dont like them".  And when issues are brought up to hirer authority, NOBODY CARES. People come in daily and steal from store and when told to management. They dont care. Goodwill is a savage, outdated, dead end, no where job. If you want a job that will hire you part time and work you 39 hours a week to the bone for 10 bucks an hour. Every 2 week pay. Apply. Never in my 8 years of experience in retail have i ever worked somewhere so corrupt, unorganized and petty.< /review>

Maybe I'm spoiled having lived on the east coast and shopped at good will in VA.. The children's clothes section is virtually non existent. The one jacket/hoodie I did find was $4.99 whereas the same jacket/hoodie in va would be $1.99. But I guess  everything is more expensive here.. But I anticipated a better selection. Sad. Because I'm a avid goodwiller.< /review>

The store in Rancho Cucamonga  has to be the worst one of them all way over priced considering  everything  is donated . The manager is rude  and argues with you on the deal your getting  compare to retail .... But this is not retail !!!<//Text>

Love this place. It's a nice family run business that I like to support.  I always get my favorite and old-fashioned with chocolate on top.

Keep supporting the local community people. This is a good one.< /Text>

<time>1518843941277< /time><Rating>1</Rating><text>Just about everything about this business is Heavenly. The shop is just so absolutely cute and classy and clean. The customer service is wonderful very welcoming and friendly. I splurged and got two donuts for $1.95 plus tip. And I have to be honest those are probably two of the worst Donuts I have ever put in my mouth. I started with the Boston cream and it was a little dry and it was well into Halfway Gone by the time I reached any cream and it was really disappointing because it tasted weird. It tasted like something had gone sour in it either the milk or egg or something or maybe it was just old. I set that one down and moved on to the Cruller. Took a bite of the Cruller and it didn't taste right. It literally left a bad taste in your mouth had like a really bitter aftertaste. I'm not sure maybe old oil and or just old flour. Nothing came even close to tasting fresh or even day old. So it looks like Raised Donuts and Bagels are still my go-to donut Shop while I'm on this side of town< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dcb872f7be89d1:0x33f1013d1adacb69<//GmapID></record>

<Review>We are monthly visitors due to the distance from home and the nearby Dr office that my mother visits. I think we need to tell everybody to stop by. Best service by far. Most delicious croissants and coffee!< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I just love this place.  The food is always excellent.  Service is great and very friendly.  All the staff there is the same for many years.  Cozy, quaint atmosphere.  I real gem for great Italian cuisine.  It has been my favorite Italian spot for many years.  I promise you will love it.< /Review>

Had the Vietnamese crepes with shrimp and the bun bowl with chicken.
Food and service were terrific.
I want to return.</review>< pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>Finished a Natural Products Convention a mile away and ended up crashing a live music event here.  The restaurant set up that night was unique, as the right side of the restaurant served regular guests but was separated almost straight down the middle from the left side where a live band and singers were performing up on small stage in front.  This venue seems suitable for live performances even though it's really a restaurant inside a strip mall.

We had a limited menu of 4 items to pick from while dining as guests of the band.  The seafood hũ tiếu ấp chảo contained 2 shrimps, a few squid and imitation crab, garnished in bok choy, broccoli and carrots.  More seafood would've enhanced the dish.</Review>< Pictures>

Saigon #9 is located in a strip mall less than a mile south of Disneyland on Harbor and Palm just north of Garden Grove Blvd. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. The food is very good and the prices are cheap. I recommend the egg rolls as they were some of the best that I have ever eaten. If you are in the area, then stop in for lunch. You really can't go wrong here with the good quality food and service.</Review>< Pictures>

The bobun was very good but the staff not so good (they made mistakes on the order and forget our shakes). You have to pay 50 cents more if you pay by card...</text>

We usually stop by while we're visiting Disneyland for a few days for a break from theme park food. This place is a nice change of pace from the crowds and expensive park food.

My wife and I went to the Red Robin next to our hotel and they are on top of their game. We sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by Bobby the bartender. We had our cocktails and order was taken within 5 minutes. Meal was excellent, service was stellar and would recommend to anyone.
Great job Red Robin! Keep up the good work.< /Text>

We've had pho in a lot of nice big cities bit this really hit the mark. This was the first time that I've wanted to eat pho more traditionally, without adding all the sauces into the broth and instead dipping the meat as I liked. The broth was so flavorful and savory it didn't need a thing. The service was great. My partner ordered a Corona beer and they brought salt and lime on the side. A small touch but it didn't go unnoticed. If we are in the area again we'll definitely be back.</review>

This is the best pho I've had, ever. We're from out of town so it's a bummer we won't get to eat here more often. Service was fast, the waitress was nice and on top of things and the prices were very inexpensive.< /review>

<text>My family was staying at the Great Wolf Lodge and the walk was less than 5 min with no crossing of major roads. The food was excellent and the service was very fast.
We had the pho and some kind of Angus beef plate which was absolutely delicious.
We will certainly eat here again during our next visit to the Lodge.  It's much cheaper and tastier than the on resort options.</text>< Time>

<Text>Very family friendly! The brought the kids water out with kids and I didn't when ask for it. I ate some yummy Pho with my 2 year old and when I asked for a small bowl to share with them they also brought out for scissors to cut the noodles. Wonderful food, clean and great service. Ample parking in the mall. Worth the 6 minutes to drive from Disneyland for some top notch Pho.<//Text><username>Amanda Stephan</username><gmap_id>0x80dcd803b3fb7a3b:0xc4b8f931f5bae971<//gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><date>1480562843696</date>< Rating>

<Review>Going against the grain here. Came because it's close to great Wolf with good reviews but the good just wasn't anything better than fine. Service was ok and food came out fast but they forgot our drink order. For all the options in garden Grove, there are much better places to go with brodard setting the standard.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I have been coming to this pho spot for awhile now and they have never dissapointed me. The pho quality has been consistently excellent and their appetizer is great. I almost come here once a week.</review>

I WOULD GIVE THIS PLACE ZERO STARS IF I COULD. FIRST OF ALL, WATCH OUT FOR THE STAIR THAT NO ONE TELLS YOU ABOUT IN THE SECOND SECTION OF THE RESTURANT. THE FOOD IS MAYBE 3/5, ON A GOOD DAY! MY COUSIN'S CHICKEN WAS MICROWAVED AND EVEN THE WAITRESS SAID, "it's still frozen?" WHEN WE REALIZED THAT THE MIDDLE OF THE CHICKEN WAS FREEZING COLD. MY RICE WITH BEEF HAD HAIR IN IT, AS WELL AS THE FRIED RICE. THEY MESSED UP OUR ORDER TWO TIMES. WOULD NEVER GO HERE EVER AGAIN. SAVE YOURSELF THE MISERY AND DO NOT COME HERE< /Text>

Very good Pho at a great price. They exceeded expectations. We both ordered Pho Tai. Great quality beef. Large portions; a regular bowl is the size of a large at most places. Very good pho broth base. Their egg roll dip sauce is the best! Will definitely be returning soon!<//Review>

<Review>This place is located in a large plaza with Chase Bank, Lee's Sandwiches, and El Super. There is plenty of parking but most likely not right in front since it is next to a banquet hall which is usually paid ked for receptions on weekends. The place can accommodate more than 95 seats and has 4 large tables for bigger groups. They leave the left side of the dining area for large groups. It has a bar area and a small stage with mic and keyboard. The menu has a little of everything. We came on a Saturday night and there was only two other tables there. However within 30 minutes, the pace filled up with many families with small children. The dining area and restrooms are clean. We ordered the Vietnamese crepe, Ha Noi noodles, and green papaya beef salad. The crepe was moderate size with adequate filling. However, it only comes with 3 types of vegetables to wrap (lettuce, mint, and beefsteak or perilla.) Usually most places that serve the crepe have a minimum of 5 vegetables. The papaya salad was generous and had two types of jerky and liver. It was very filling. The Ha Noi noodles only had two types of pork (grilled pork and pork patties) and same standard vegetables. It was still flavourful. The Vietnamese coffee was good here but not as strong compared to Lee's. All non Vietnamese people around us ordered Pho while the Vietnamese tables ordered various items. The servers were attentive. This place would receive a 5 star if not for vegetables and meager meat servings for the noodles. Also I haven't tried some of their more popular items like Pho to give them a higher rating. They do accept credit card and you can beat the hassle of crowded Vietnamese restaurants like in the Little Saigon area.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Grilled pork ribs rice is very delicious and rich. I did not finish eating and brought back the refrigerator and it was still very delicious.

In the Daiso and El Super zones. Spacious parking

Customer service was friendly but uninformed and unable to really assist meaningfully. Location is difficult to see until you're nearly on it.</Text>

<text>I went in to smog my Infiniti and was out within 15min !! If you want friendly and fast service this is a MUST !! They are very affordable and they don’t rip you off with a crazy price like most smog shops. I called before going to get an estimate. I spoke to a guy named Israel, him and some other guy did my smog. Trust me,  if you’re looking around for a place to go do your smog THIS IS THE PLACE!!!

P.S. got my certificate and was able to go purchase my tags immediately at a DMV Kiosk!</text><user>114116312794306244658<//user><time>1579383384890</time>< gmapID>

<Text>Cool, small venue, great for shows. Staff was super friendly and beers reasonably priced! Amazing. Little confusing on how to find entrance as there are 2 venues and Maps leads to one, but this one was downstairs and  not so clear how to get to. But great experience overall!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I went to see the first West Coast appearance of the world famous General Zooz of The Reggae Rajahs and it was absolutely insane. Salute to the General!
Great location. The sound system really pops, it's got a great bass that you can feel in your bones. There's a beautiful large downstairs floor with plenty of room to dance. There are two bars, and a smoking patio.
There is a separate upstairs room that had a live band that night I went.<//Review><rate>4< /rate><user_id>110568012198992118432< /user_id><GmapID>0x80c2c71bb9b85e9b:0xd6c828cd3a86de15<//GmapID></record>

< review>
Great sound system and a good room for mid-size club shows. The drawback is the terrible light setup. That is, great for dancing, not so much for focusing on a performer during a live show.

It's a deep stage and almost all the lights are behind the artist. The ones that do hit them from the front are generally overhead and hard. The result is generally a backlit performer unless they jump back deeper into the stage.

Another byproduct of this setup is that lights behind the artist focused on them tend to just aim straight into the eyes of the audience. Again, great for the dance portions of the evening. Frustrating during a performance.< /review>

Small venue with a bar area in the back and some seats in the corner.  This place has special meaning to me because it was the venue of the first concert I attended and got something autographed. Parking is tough to find if you don't know where you're going,  but the location is nice because it's close to a lot of things.< /text>

Great place to see bands, good sound, decent stage, big room.
Also residency Mondays offer free shows from local bands and it's also a great place to see up and coming or big bands doing special shows, if you love being close to them as they play.

I placed an order through chownow because I thought they would deliver. I requested a refunded because I didn't understand that chownow was pick up only, and they said they could not fulfill the refund. Disappointing, I was eagerly looking to ordering from this restaurant. If they can't understand when a basic mistake is made, and they insist on keeping my money anyway, I can't see myself giving them money in the future.< /Text>

We ordered for take out and it was ready at the expected pick up time. The pick up was quick and easy! They give you bread, which was amazing. I like how they put sea salt flakes on top of the bread, gives it extra flavor. We ordered the pesto with burrata, black truffle and lasagna. The black truffle sauce was amazing, super umami flavor. I suggest pairing it with tagliatelle instead of pappardelle for more bang for your buck. The pesto was an okay pesto, not memorable. The lasagna was flavorful, creamy and noodles were cooked pefectly. It held up great for the next day too. Overall, the food was good and they use high quality ingredients.</text>

Drinks are expensive, but just pregame. Check out the downstairs, it's usually empty & good underground DJs! Also, a lot of room to dance. As far as the upstairs, TOO packed cause it's so small but if you go early u can catch a good spot in the front. It is usually for the main DJ. Have fun!< /text>

<Text>Parking info, to park - the small attached parking lot to the entrance of the venue is a CITY LOT #676 for PUBLIC PARKING and it's only enforced until 9pm so it's free for all by the time your show starts. Echoplex barricades the lot entrance every night and when I tried to get in, their security thugs threatened to search my car if I parked there. I told him he didn't have a warrant then he said he had "probable cause" like he's a real cop. Another security claimed LADOT let them use the lot every night. I ended up calling LAPD and the police officer left me a voicemail saying he met with venue's manager and confirmed they didn't have permit to barricade the City Lot. Manager denied about car search and said their security wouldn't block any car from going in/out... but yet they barricaded the entrance and utilized thugs to block. LAPD told me he's going to report this to their Illegal Valet Taskforce. I posted a picture of the City Lot sign, you can also see it on Google Maps (but I have no doubt Echoplex will vandalize it) guard your rights if you wanna park there for $2.5 or free after 9pm.<//Text>< Resp>

Small venue with a bar area in the back and some seats in the corner.  This place has special meaning to me because it was the venue of the first concert I attended and got something autographed. Parking is tough to find if you don't know where you're going,  but the location is nice because it's close to a lot of things.< /Text>

<Text>We ordered for take out and it was ready at the expected pick up time. The pick up was quick and easy! They give you bread, which was amazing. I like how they put sea salt flakes on top of the bread, gives it extra flavor. We ordered the pesto with burrata, black truffle and lasagna. The black truffle sauce was amazing, super umami flavor. I suggest pairing it with tagliatelle instead of pappardelle for more bang for your buck. The pesto was an okay pesto, not memorable. The lasagna was flavorful, creamy and noodles were cooked pefectly. It held up great for the next day too. Overall, the food was good and they use high quality ingredients.</Text>< pics>

<Review>I placed an order through chownow because I thought they would deliver. I requested a refunded because I didn't understand that chownow was pick up only, and they said they could not fulfill the refund. Disappointing, I was eagerly looking to ordering from this restaurant. If they can't understand when a basic mistake is made, and they insist on keeping my money anyway, I can't see myself giving them money in the future.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Any place that lets you get up on the stage as much as this deserves at least 4 stars. Giving 5 cause they let me in free of charge even tho I was late< /review>

As far as the upstairs, TOO packed cause it's so small but if you go early u can catch a good spot in the front. It is usually for the main DJ. Have fun!<//Text>< pictures>

Went here to see Ensiferum and Kalmah, two metal bands from Europe. Parking is unavailable at the venue, but there is a parking lot across the street. $15 on a Friday night is Not bad for LA. Security includes metal detectors. Venue is small but not cramped by any means. Beer a little pricey but not blown out of proportion. Decent acoustics and sound for a smaller venue. Would come here again.< /Text>

Fun nightspot, big stage and dancefloor area,  spacious around the bar. Music was great, went there on an 2000s hip-hop night, main DJ played some awesome old hits that I had forgotton about. Bar service was good, good list of beers, prices were ok.<//text>

Great place to see a show and get up close to the stage. Sound is excellent and plenty of space in front of stage. Multiple stages including one in the back by the alleyway. Couple bar options inside keep lines short. Perfect for a 3 band lineup and evening with friends.< /Text>

Street parking is kind of tricky, but I also make out okay. You should be able to find something no more than a block away. Dub nights and funky sole are fun. Drink prices are steep, but the covers are usually pretty low. Like $5-10, maybe $20 if there's a show. Two dance areas and a patio downstairs. Upstairs is a big spacious venue with a papi as well. I've never had a bad time here. Always fun and the people are friendly. Bathrooms are decent - for this type of venue. Dress code is casual - meaning you don't have to wear heels, and a ball gown, but you absolutely can. Stunting is optional here, but always welcome. And they've got two boots pizzeria next door to fill your drunken belly.</review>

Expensive unimpressive drinks, bad acoustics, and overly loud to boot. Kind of a pit, and a disappointment given the iconic status of this venue. Least favorite venue in LA so far. Probably perfect for hardcore or punk shows, but otherwise not a place I plan to seek out more often. Literally had to step over a river of fresh urine to get in as there is a significant homeless encampment right out front under the bridge. I don't know how much they can do about that, but it was a memorable context with which to start the night.. Staff was perfectly friendly tho.</review>

Went to Emo night recently here. I raged, I cried, I danced, I cried some more. Lost my glasses, cried even more. Emailed their lost and found and didnt get any reply whatsoever and now I am even more sad than when I went there to be sad. This is the saddest review I can give. With tears in my eyes, thanks for nothing.< /Review>

This is my favorite spot to get down and let loose. I am never disappointed when I go there. Jasmine (Manager) is the best. The security is always on top of everything. The bar tenders make strong drinks. The music always on point. It's open 7 days a week. Love this place.<//Review>

<review>Live music experience is great, but street parking only and is non-existent because you share with the Echo Park neighborhood. Take your chances but you will have to wait for a spot to open up. Getting to the venue is confusing, it needs better directions. Space is adequate, but large crowds can make this feel like you’re in a mosh pit of someone randomly bumps into you. Not that much space when a big name comes into town.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Rocky, classy, not too fancy. Wide and open space. Very cool: the spacious smoking area that made me feel like the cool college kid, drinking beer and smoking with the others. Was here for a concert of a punkrock band, pretty perfect place for this kind of music. Staff quick and friendly, the security was aware, nice and competent. Very nice: a lot of restrooms. Drinks: standard. But honestly : focus lies on the music and the people. Well located, nice sound. Loved it.< /Text>< Rating>

<text>My pants were very tight so I asked the manager if they had any shorts I could borrow and he said no but his dad did. He called his dad who I guessed lived around the corner and he brought me some very nice salmon colored trunks with a little dolphin on it and some pudding his wife had made. Ill definitely be back.< /text>< pictures>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>It was great, because it was so small and intimate whereby I was able to see the band up close. Part of why it worked, which may or may not be attributable to the venue itself, was that there were not too many people in attendance, which allowed me to me to stand comfortably close enough to the stage without feeling like I was jammed into a sardine can.

A negative aspect of this The Ocean Blue show here at the Echoplex which, again, may or may not be attributable to the venue itself was that it was too loud, because the gain/volume was too high overall.  This was especially true in the ear that was closer to the speakers, as the degree to which I was standing off center was the extent to which it was disproportionately loud in that ear. So, in anticipation of loudness, I put in my 3M earplugs, and guess what? Even though this limited damage to my eardrums, I literally couldn't perceive any more than 10% of the words of David Schelzel was saying.</Review>< pics>

<review>The Echoplex was the place where I had my first concert, it made a great impression. The place was a bit difficult to find, but not impossibly so. It's got a good atmosphere and a nice big area for concert goers to stand in. The stage is great and there's enough light to enjoy the show. 👍< /review>< Rating>

<review>Dub club on Wednesday nite.  Been going for years.  Always enjoy the Reggae Artists they bring.. If you go early not much people..but after a while the place gets a crowd.

I did not realize at the tie  but I've been here once before but that was about 5 years ago. The set was great, the drinks were stiff, and a good time was had by all. The entrance is technically on Glendale Blvd and is below the overpass on Sunset. If you parked on Sunset and need to walk it they have a pedestrian stairway across the street from The Echo. It's easy.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I just love the vibe on  Wednesday nights (reggae nights) the place is pretty big, me being fun size and being a little claustrophobic, I can walk and dance around this whole club with ease not saying that it doesn't get packed because it does. I love it. Con- They should have more drink specials or girls should get in for free one or other would be great.< /review>

I visited this venue for the first time a few days ago for now famous Emo Night event. My entire group had an amazing experience. The crowd was full of energy, the music was great, the atmosphere electrifying; I highly recommend it. We did have to wait for almost 2 hours to get in so next time, I'll be looking into VIP tickets.< /text>

I love going to this place because they have the best reggae music in town. I've seen so many of my favorite artists play here from Ras Michael to Half Pint to Israel Vibration. Even if there are no music acts playing I can go there just to listen to some good roots.</Review>

Came here for 143 and I was super hesitant because of all the mixed reviews. I came on the night that 88rising sponsored the event. My friend who was flying for 88rising told me the line was getting really long at about 8:30pm. My boyfriend and I were debating about driving or ubering over. We ended up ubering but later found there was valet parking across the street for about 20 bucks. We got there at about 9:30 and though there was a line, it didn't take us longer than 15-20 minutes to get in. The line was moving fast and it was $10 at the door to get in.

Once we got inside, it was like a mini reunion. Saw some old friends and people I knew from HS or even college. They have two stages with two different types of music playing--one upstairs and one downstairs. They have one bar upstairs and two downstairs and while their menu's are pretty similar, they may have different beer selections at the different bars. Beers start from like $5 and go up to about $9. They also sell food such as pizza for $5 a slice.

Protip: I wouldn't wear a nice purse or shoes as it's really easy to spill drinks in there. And, dress casual cute, honestly, if you don't need a purse, don't take it.

All in all, I was pleasantly surprised. The surprise guest for the night were Rich Brian and Niki. (They only played like two-ish songs but who cares! It was fun)

Once your drunk self wants to leave, they sell tacos and street dogs right outside the venue so you can grab one prior to ubering yourself home.< /text>

<text>I have only gone to the Echoplex for Bootie LA. It's always *ALWAYS* a good time. Be ready for lots of dancing, lots of fun and friendly (and too friendly) people. I went to the holiday theme event this year and it was a lot of fun. The dancers on stage are the best and the music is great and upbeat.

There are two bars and they are reasonably priced and there is never a long wait to get your booze.

Parking has always been easy. Lots of street parking is available or you can valet your car. I was also happy to see two street hot dog carts out after the party.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c71bb9b85e9b:0xd6c828cd3a86de15<//Gmap_id></record>

amazing staff, great bar selection, large interior... my only gripe was it’s not the easiest place to find, but it’s right behind the tattoo shop when you enter into the small parking lot<//text>

Took over 30 minutes to find its entrance which is on an entirely different street perpendicular AND below the bridge that the official street address is on, is this some kind of a joke or a torture for the club to laugh at all the dummies that come and waste their precious time looking for their entrance? Have some professional standard! I'm never going back to this sorry excuse for a venue.</text>< pics>

My first time at this venue, only reason I’m giving it two stars I’d because I was forced to re pay after I had bought my tickets online, they said someone used one of my tickets saying it happens a lot. Very awkward situation but I wanted to see the show so I paid AGAIN. Overall the venue was decent the sound was at times very intense I needed ear plugs which was also unsettling. I would think twice before going back if so.<//review>

It was pretty dope, only complain I got is how small the pit is. So you're more than likely to get slammed by someone for the punk shows, which is bound to happen. Other than that cool spot. I believe there is 2 bars and a sitting area when you need to catch your breath.< /review>

I love the concerts they have every weekend, I always come here with my friends to have a good time, staff are nice and the security guards are pretty cool once you get to know them and come here often. However, its location is nice but the areas around it are very sketchy, night< /review>

The live music is great here on Wednesdays. Find me here. Stop by and say hi. I'm here often on Wednesdays. The beer selection is great. They have a outside area to smoke with TV's of the stage so you'll know whenever the nights about to get even better. I recommend this place to you all. Don't miss out and dance the night away.   -Sergio/Tony D.< /Text>

<Review>EMO NITE is thee BEST night to go! So much fun! Great energy! The only negative I have is that it is SUPER hot inside! The air was literally moist. You almost feel like you are going to pass out. No fans, no AC, no ventilation. That was horrible. Literally dripping in sweat. So, I hope they crank up the AC or add some fans because it is such a fun venue.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2c71bb9b85e9b:0xd6c828cd3a86de15< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is pretty fun. The layout inside is good. The stage has an area in front where you can dance, and there is lots of open space. There are two bars (one close to the stage and one farther away). The pillars all have little table things which means there are some places to set your stuff down, and the long sides of the room have couches.
The drink prices are not bad. A pint of pbr is 5 bucks, a pint of bud is 6, and Angel city brewery beers were 7/8.
The security is usually pretty chill. The one thing that annoys me is that they have that dude in the bathroom that holds all the paper towels so when you wash your hands you are forced to interact with him and feel guilty about not buying stuff from him. I can grab my own paper towels, I don't need to accept one from someone else.<//text>

I never knew Echo Park was so hip. I grew up near here 50+ years ago when it wasn't so hip. I've been here more than a few times to see music acts and all have been fun and exciting. Tonight going to the Spin Year in Music at the Regent Theater. One of three venues in this Plex. Should be another fun night!</Text>

It's fun small venue where events are usually worth it. They have a somewhat limited selection of alcohol. There are two floors to this building each with its own show.</Review>

I loved the facility so much that I sent you three locally acclaimed "Graffic" novels, 'Soul vs 7 Deadly Sins' to the Echoplex along with two selections of my graphic novels from another genre, 'Perfect Blend: 100 Renditions of...', and 'the Community Sponsor$hip  Program' ... a $153 +shipping.  Since then arriving early to attend the club has been a fruitless lure.

Upon considering it again, I thought perhaps it was good enough for approximqtely 30 passes to the club (getting in without paying a coat was the regular anyway,  the club would lose nothing according to promise)...no dice.

So the Echoplex recently taught me an invaluable lesson in marketing!!! Thank you for that, Echolex.< /text>

Does not comply with California's ADA standards despite claiming ADA accessibility. Terrible support from venue staff who claimed ADA support was "not their problem" without offering to find someone to help.<//Text>

1. One sentence review – one of my favorite places to see shows in LA
2. The venue – the Echoplex (downstairs) is larger than the Echo (upstairs), but both are pretty small venues that create a more intimate setting and leave no bad seat (spot) in the house. I’ve never seen a show at either venue where I felt like I had a bad spot in the crowd.
3. Smoking – the Echoplex has a separate side patio for smoking that’s really convenient and a nice place to hang out for a bit if you need a break between acts. They somewhat monitor for people blazing but I’ve seen people get away with it pretty easily.
4. Parking – the biggest downside is that the parking situation is really rough unless you get there early enough to get one of the spots in the two lots behind the venue.<//Text>

Went out the on a Friday to meet some friends, you have to buy ticket to go inside which is fine but you can't leave cuz If you do then you have to pay again. I went in and got played by the ticketing guy after handing out 50 dollars bill to him. he claimed its 20. Anyways, I could be wrong, Not really. inside was not special but I bet they have a cheap booze it was so dark. I left after 20 min. What I'm saying go spend you money somewhere else cuz not worth it.< /review>

The venue is fine, nothing too amazing, nothing bad. This is about their lost and found department. My friend lost her phone at a show last week and I have not been able to get any confirmation if it's there not not. I have emailed multiple address and times, posted on their Facebook, messaged on Instagram, no response at all. I would just like to know so my friends could possibly pick it up and ship it to me in Seattle.
P.s. echoplex, if you read this and get back to me I'll gradly take down this review.</review>

It's a big space to hold any party and any party works.

Outdoors patio is a very rad place.

Parking around the venue is easily attainable is one is patient and knows where to look (a bunch of residential around to search).</text><user_name>alice chung<//user_name><user>106872931347957247205< /user><resp>None<//resp><rating>4<//rating><gmap_id>0x80c2c71bb9b85e9b:0xd6c828cd3a86de15<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If you don't mind crowds and few places to sit, this is not a bad venue. The room itself allows for a couple different staging areas, despite the size.</Review>

The echoplex is a great venue to watch bands or attend emonite. It's like a big basement

This is a great space for a venue. The area isn't overly populated and there is plenty of free parking in the area. This venue is also a lot more spacious than it's sister venue, the Echo, upstairs. I've come to a few of the Redbull events here, and its ALWAYS a good time...more than usual because Redbull is the sponser. Sometimes Vans will sponser an event here too, and they hand out free stuff.<//review>

<Review>I've been going to the Echoplex for about 3 years now especially for Bootie L.A. new years event. Everytime I go, security is too aggressive physically but this new years (2012/2013) they took it over the top. Saw around 2 - 3 female security gaurds smacking some girl in a red dress while this girl just tried covering her face..... just terrible. Not going there ever again.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>After being in the restroom my daughters privacy was invaded. A staff member "security" went from underneath the stall even though she was told NO I am not feeling well. Was proceeded to be dragged out and abused, hit, stepped on head and beat. Your staff decided to press charges while beating an innocent person on the ground.<//Text>< Pics>
