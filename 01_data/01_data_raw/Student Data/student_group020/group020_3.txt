Toys! This is a very small, very crowded  toy and collectibles store. Walked in here in a Saturday afternoon and had to constantly go around stands to avoid running into people, and still I only saw half the store. There's a ton of POP!s, Hello Kitty, and Dragonball Z. I liked the store and found a few things for my toddler but the next time I'll go will definitely be on a week day.<//Text>

I never leave a review but this interaction left me so irate
Would not recommend for funko pops I asked a price of a Imperial Robin chase and the employee said he couldn’t get the manager to price it yet so, I came back the next day only for him to not recognize me and tell me directly he bought it himself with his store discount and how he runs a resale business using his store discount and proximity to get rare funko pops</review>

It's a bit cramped though nice to find a variety of toys that fit in to my tastes but they're over priced. They had some Calico Critters here and I checked the prices on Amazon before buying and they were half the price for both of them. (27 was 14 and 14 was 7)

Safe to say I bought them online and they actually arrived in less than a day. So be aware some items may be over priced.<//Text>

Today was the first day of summer, my friends and I decided to go to Victoria Gardens. We walked into this toy store, my friend bought a squishy and we left to get food at the food court afterwards. Shortly after I went to find my other friend outside, a lady who works at the toy store came up to us asking if we stole a blue panda squishy. Of course we didn’t because we know what is right and wrong to not steal things and we really didn’t. Then, my friend and I went into the food court to find our other friend ordering food, a few minutes later the same lady came back asking to check mine and my friend who was ordering food’s bag. As we already told her we never stole the squishy. My friends and I found a place to sit in the food court after and the same lady came up to us again saying that she saw us holding the squishy and after my dad called the store about this situation, that we ran out the store. Just because we were said to be holding a blue panda squishy which I don’t recall doing and that we “ran” out the store which we didn’t, doesn’t mean that the workers can accused us of stealing a couple dollar squishy. My friend even bought herself a squishy there when she was with us, so if we really wanted the squishy we would have bought it and not steal it. The worker there shouldn’t have walked to the food court which was about 200 feet away from their store and accuse us of stealing a squishy and checking our bags. They had no proof whatsoever and embarrassed themselves because of a couple dollar squishy.</text>

Cute place to go if you are looking for nostalgia toy items or a new hot something. The store was small & tight to walk around in, if you're claustrophobic just window shop.</Review>

<review>Bit pricey... just saying bcus i go to an actual anime or manga venue and the price are equal or more than the actual collector edition.
Example,  the new Deadpool back pack from Barn and Nobles is $60. A old model back pack is at $70+ and $63 for another. You could go online to get it from $60 and it's authentic. Not saying Optimus is not but it is kinda iffy.</review><user>101861704530096792663<//user><response>None<//response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

Just came out of the store 7/16 8:10pm and saw a red jafar limited edition glow chase piece on the countertop and asked how much and if available, female cashier said $12.99 and it's available. I said sold I'll take it she asked it's 2 for $20 so I went to check for one more came back for my red jafar and another female said the red jafar is $29.99 and I said your coworker said it's $12.99 and that they can't change the price. Told them to call the owner and mins later of course no price change. They wouldn't let me buy it for $12.99, left empty handed. DONT GO HERE DONT STEP YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR COLLECTOR OR NOT!!</review>

<Text>Jam packed to the point of feeling a bit cramped with toys of all variety. I specifically like the availability of anime toys which I feel your standard toy stores seem to miss< /Text>< pics>

I liked going here to buy anime figures because there are not a lot of toy stores that carry them. I purchased two SAO figures to give as a gift and when I gave to my friend I was advised that one was a bootleg version. I was surprised and embarrassed. So I went back to talk to the manager of the store but ended up speaking to the sales person who insisted that it was just what we sell here and since it was over 14 days and I didn't have my receipt there was nothing she could do for me. So now I'm suck with a fake figure and will never shop there again. All I wanted was a store credit. What a shame! Buyers beware!</Text>

Overpriced items that can be found online much cheaper. But it is nice to walk into and see things in person just to browse.< /Review>

<Review>I lost count of how many toy stores and toy related retailers I went to.
One store at Mills suggested I come here.
They actually had what I was looking for, the last one too!</Review>< date>

We came as a group of 7. Ordered 6 dishes to share.  I enjoyed the fish bake in banana leaves, the fry fish and a eggplant dish.  We also had chili chicken, a beef stir fry dish; these latter two dishes were all right.  The portion sizes were smaller than expected. There's street parking only, the service was quick and  great.< /Text>

<review>A gateway to a different world,  with good food included.  The interior is magical. Our server was an affable lady, she was amazing and very kind. For food, we ordered a squash curry (yes, there is such a thing) and a remarkable salad. Planning to come here again, for the staff, food, and the atmosphere.< /review><gmapID>0x808f7e5d1557382b:0x8d737e7940bb20c8< /gmapID>< Rating>

Good taste like Khmer food. The taste of food and how the food look might be similar to Thai food a little bit since Angkor Borei restaurant run by husband and wife which man is from Thailand and lady is from Cambodia. The lady who runs this business is sweet and caring. The way she treats me is recapped me of how my grandma loves me. It’s kind of similar being in a Cambodian family’s home. She is not only friendly to Cambodian people as I check google review before coming here.

Brilliant menu choice, the staffs are willing to help you choose which food to eat if you don’t know what to eat. The dishes that I try are Amok fish, Brohok ktizz, Sach Ko Ang and Mju Krerng. If you want it, just tell her, she will understand it, especially get the Amok Fish due it’s delicious and very authentic. The food proportion might a bit small for American. Every food here is delicious. I can’t say enough good thing about this restaurant. This place is absolutely valuing my trip.

Thank you for reading my review, I hope it can help. May enjoy the yummy and fresh food there.< /Text>

The seafood is out of this world. I got shrimp baked in foil and it was SO good. I hope this spot stays open or finds another way to serve the Bay Area because it’s legitimately so good and unique.< /Review>

This restaurant is a real favorite of our family: cozy, warm, and delicious.

They have something for everyone: The spicy food can be REALLY spicy, which is great if that's what you're looking for -- no holds barred. :) They also have simple and plain food that can be good for kids or picky eaters.

Highly recommended!</Review>

Great value for solid Cambodian food. I love the larb here and really every dish has great flavors. Service is warm and friendly. One of my favorite local options!  Also helps that it reminds of the one trip I took to Cambodia :)</Text>

Can't say enough good things about this place. The service is phenomenal here -- the folks who run it are super sweet and caring. It's kind of like being in a Cambodian family's home. The food is super yummy -- was craving Cambodian food and it's not very common in the Bay area. This place is absolutely worth the trip.</Text>

There's smoke when I entered. However, the staff was very pleasant. The appetizer was just okay but the Amok fish was really tender and tasty. The black sticky rice and mango was very delicious as well.</text>

Got the lunch special.  Ginger beef had really good flavor and sauce.  BBQ chicken very similar to Thai BBQ chicken if not the same.  Both were delicious and served with rice and a tiny salad.<//Review>

<review>I am very happy to find a Cambodia restaurant in San Francisco. Situated on a busy street, the modestly decorated restaurant offers a choice if you look for a different taste from Thai and Vietnamese. Comfortably situated for American customers, the menu offers plenty of dishes that are easy to order. The service is friendly. A good place to casual lunch and dinner dining.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

This place was so good!! The lady serving us was extremely friendly. The pumpkin curry is a must, but honestly everything we got was yummy. You HAVE to get their black sticky rice with mango dessert!!< /review>

This place is definitely a hidden gem in this (not yet gentrified) part of Mission street. The service is excellent, the food is delicious, and it's never crowded. The best part is that you can have a conversation in a normal tone of voice here. Great place to meet a group of friends or for a date. Highly recommended.< /Review>

< Review>
I love this place! The decor is kind of fancy, but the prices aren't much at all, only about $11-12 per entree.  I wasn't sure if I'd like Cambodian food.  I did work at a Cambodian Center before, but all that homemade food was very different. This tasted like Thai food to me, which I love. I've had the pumpkin curry, spring rolls, ginger beef, sweet and sour pork and the chili prawns- all delicious!<//Review>

Never had a meal here that wasn't delicious!  My favorite peeps and I come here to enjoy yummy, nutritious, eye-pleasing & affordable meals.  Owners Shen Han & Tom are lovely people.  Street parking can be hard sometimes but can often be had near the restaurant.<//Review>

Food was amazing! We don't have any Khmer restaurants in Houston, so I decide to come here after it was recommended.

I ordered the Larb (pork) and the Spicy Hot Sour Soup. Both highly recommended! The Larb was filling, vegetables were fresh. Spicy Soup: light, delicious, good amount of spice. Wish I orders more items though lol!

10/10 for both.

Service was excellent. Forgot the lady's name, but she was very sweet and helpful. Felt like home!<//text>

I'd say it's a bit pricey but that's probably only because i'm used to my mom making the exact same things in more quantity. :)
But the food is definitely authentic and exactly what i expect from cambodian food.
The service is great as well and the couple that runs the place always greet and serve with a smile.</review>

<Review>Why all these people keep saying "this is the Cambodian restuarant"? Since, all the food are Thai dishes.

@The owner, that would sound better for you to say this, "This is the Cambodian-Owner restaurant, but we are serving Thai food" that would be the correct information.

Cambodian food are totally different from Thai food, they don't have coconut curries as Thai. They have soup with clear broth, some dishes could be spicy and not sweet. They have no coconut milk and curries paste. Some dishes like salad. And all dishes you have at Angkor Borie, probably the same menu as other Thai restaurants in Bay area. Please stop confusing us and also stop feeding us false information.

I saw it on the program of KQEDL, they were all confused and giving false information as well. They even mentioned that probably Cambodian food more sweet Than Thai. That's totally wrong.

Those food you were talking about are Thai food.

I would love to try Cambodian too. But, I wont get confused between Thai food and Cambodian food.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>Have you ever had a cadre of Cambodians disappear behind a cash register with a pumpkin to return with MAGIC PUMPKINS?

I have.

Service and food = impeccable.
Zero wait.
Good takeout.
Marinates very well overnight.
Affordable.
From larb to fish soufflé, A+.

Just beware of the super douchey dude-patrons that want to strike up conversations with the endearing servers about the genocide endured by Cambodian citizens. Yes, that really happened.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp>< username>

Decent food, but the service is sometimes slow. I prefer Pad Thai just up the street on Mission (the food here isn't very different from Thai food).< /Text>

This is also a good place for lunch.  I had Cambodian steamed noodles and it was similar to the Vietnamese Bún chả giò chay - Rice Noodles with Spring Roll only the ingredients were separate and on a plate.  It was really tasty, light and hit the spot.  Friendly service.< /text>

<text>Campuchea in the taste buds! Clever, suble vegetable based cuisine shines at this smallish place, tucked away in Bernal. Service very helpful in guiding the diner to discover Cambodian cuisine, known for its subtle blending of sweet/sour/umami. A must visit place.</text></record></dataset><record>

Had recently been to Cambodia, so was excited for some authentic cuisine.. crabs Kep style with Kampot pepper, fish amok etc. They didn't know what we were talking about and felt like Thai food with a sign that said Cambodia.</review>

<Text>My wife loves this store.  It's her replacement for Pier One.  Store is always clean and staff is friendly.  Some stuff is a little pricey for what it is, but my wife likes to shop the sales.  She is also on their email list and always gets coupons and combines them with the sale items when she is able too.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Finally made it to Kirkland's - what's not to love?! They have everything you never knew you needed, and more!  My girls are in elementary school, and I think they love this place over Claire's now. =)<//Text>

Great selection of home items. Seasonal and decorative. I enjoy this place when I visit, and even order online. Great lamps, pictures, pillows, rugs, kitchenware. Good location and never really busy. Quiet shopping without pest sales people.<//Text>

<Text>I live in Huntington Beach and always make a point when I am in the Redlands area to stop in at Kirkland's.  I love everything about this store.  They have a great selection of seasonal items as well as everyday items.  Also, if you need a gift this is the place to go.  And as far as the store help, Ron and Audrey are both exceptional sales representatives.</Text>< Pictures>

Most places only have a single holding picture frame and I really wanted something that had a collage. Kirkland had one that retailed for only $14.99. As if that wasn't a steal when I drove down to the store I found it on sale for $10 and the store had a one day only 20% your purchase! :D There's no better feeling than unexpectedly saving a few dollars. Customer service was awesome as well. Overall pleasant experience with money well spent.</Review>< Pics>

Overall it’s a very nice and serene place to live at. The neighbors are friendly and the furneighbors are even friendlier! It’s the perfect apartment to start off at but I wouldn’t recommend it if you have a family of 4. The living space is too small and there isn’t enough or I’d rather say any storage in general. I do want to mention and give a big thanks to Belinda, whom I believe is the property manager. She made the move in process a great ease! She was straightforward and honest and I really appreciate that.< /review>

And the new management is so nice. Anita was patient, thorough, and so so nice as I toured apartments & asked a million questions.

The Staff here is top notch. They made the moving process exceedingly easy.  True Customer Service is exemplified here at Park Place and many other establishments should take a Que from them.<//Text>

We used to live here years and years and years ago and looking at it today I'm blown away at how much it's grown for one and two how amazing each area seems to be put together. Like individual an Oasis for each building area and multiple levels that really make all the difference in the ambience and serenity of these apartments. Literally I'm blown away they're utterly beautiful and fantastic I can't say enough good things great upgrades I'm so jelly!!!!< /text>

Apartment hunting is tough especially when you're on a time crunch trying to find something ASAP. When my boyfriend and I first stepped inside the leasing office, we were nicely greeted and felt welcomed! We were introduced to Lourdes who helped us throughout our application process. If we had any questions or doubts, she was always quick to respond! We fell in love with the area and most importantly, we fell in love with one of the units we saw on our self guided tour. On the day we received our keys, we noticed there was a mistake (on our part) and had applied for the wrong unit. Thankfully, Lourdes helped us out and within the hour, we received the keys to the unit we originally fell in love with at first. Process went so smoothly and as a first timer renting an apartment, I'm truly satisfied! Upon move in, we noticed a few minor things with the apartment. Contacted Lourdes, she entered everything on their system and said they should be taking care of it soon. Few hours later on the same day, maintenance supervisor (Arshad) stopped by and took care of it and welcomed us. We are pleased and happy at our new apartment!<//Review>

Great location, newly renovated apartments, and friendly staff. I've lived here for several years and have always been treated well when I visit the office or put in a maintenance request (Alan is awesome!!)

First, we were given all of the wrong keys upon move in but that's okay! Our unit was never locked so anyone could have walked in. We received our keys about 4 hours later. Once we entered the apartment, it wasnt updated like promised. They installed the new flooring the next day and within the week there were half inch to 1 inch gaps that were between the boards and the flooring. Myself and one of my friends got hurt just trying to walk in the hallway with the boards this way. It took over a month for the floor to be fixed. It also took almost 2 months for them to fix the bathroom door so it would close. My most recent work orders, they never came by and ended up marking the orders as completed. These are just the highlights and nowhere near the full story or even close to all the issues. I wouldn't live here unless you have the time to call and email them everyday all day about anything that needs to be done. Home is supposed to be the place to relax, instead it is a constant nightmare with the elusive staff and their slow of excuses.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I applied at these apartments and the leasing agent Brittany was very unresponsive she was very dis
organized she asked me to send her my check stubs that had already been sent to her they took forever with my application I found somewhere else to live and they stole my holding deposit of 250$ . Don’t apply here it’s a scam they will take forever to process your application and make you find somewhere else to live then steal your money and make it seem like it’s your fault . I will be calling corporate .</Review>

The location is nice. It's a 15 minute walk to the river or downtown Fair Oaks. Can't say the same for the staff. Except for the Maintenance Supervisor Art. He is respectful, very professional and gets his work completed efficiently.

Update: So far I'm quite impressed with the new manager Jodee. She has great communication skills as well as responds to my emails promptly. She has completed almost all of my maintenance issues in a very timely manner as well as addressed my other concerns.<//text>

<Text>*(DO NOT LIVE HERE!!!!)
Lived here for almost a half a year now (regretfully) and its hell. Landscaping works early on weekends right in your window, rent and utilities always get raised, cold water in faucet always comes out hot. Pools always dirty, they charge you to use the mail room to pick up packages. They charge you for Trash valet, which is kind of expected yet the cost of it is always raised. They charge you for the weight of the dumpsters outside, which is absolutely insane! Even when their own maintenance crew and other ignorant tenants leave old closet doors and other furniture in the dumpsters, thus causing everyone to pay more for the month. They give off the illusion that they maintain the area and value your tenants only slowly raising bills and costs as time goes on with no reasonable explanation. nothing is ever gets fixed properly, but if you do manage to get some one to come over to fix something that doesn't take upwards to 4-5 months, would be a rare occurrence. Terrible place to live, I won't out so bad but my lease isn't up till the end of the year. Please save your self the trouble of dealing with the incompetent staff and their greedy inhumane rental policies. This places gives absolutely zero respect to their tenants. Live somewhere else.< /Text>< Name>

This place looks amazing, and I did take a walk and drive around the complex a few times just to make sure before I rented here that it was just as quite than the mornings😉. Anyhow it never failed and yes Yelp does it no justice whatsoever. I also took a tour twice before making the commitment to this place.

No one did a walk through with me when I moved in or when I moved out. Apartment had normal wear and tear. Checked my email this morning to find out they are charging me over $2000 for painting. The walls had no Mark's by the way. Manager Jamie informed me all tenants have to pay for repainting. I would have never lived there if I knew that. It was hell living there. Always something whether it be the water turned off to not having anything on the patio. I have contacted housing authority and they will be doing an investigation. I'm not gonna let them get over on me and they should be ashamed of themselves. Also I know my laws and if it's normal wear and tear you dont get charged. period. Dont rent here. They charge for everything ,give notices all the time for little things, and it almost felt like harassment. I was never comfortable in my own home. Be ware.<//Text>< Resp>

We understand the frustration that can come along in receiving unexpected charges and I appreciate your giving us the opportunity to clarify your move out charges in our phone call today. It is my understanding that the email you received may not have given a description of the charges. Please note; you will be receiving a break down of complete services needed in order to prepare your previous apartment for our next resident.  If I may, I would like to take a moment to address  your concern about a charge for painting. There has been no charge for $2000.  I believe there was a miscommunication in understanding the actual charges included.  The detailed breakdown that that you will receive, will reflect that your household was charged a fraction of the billed invoice to complete a paint touch up and replace the flooring. Your portion did not exceed more than $200 for both services.  All residents are allotted a wear and tear allowance based on the length of residency. If you would like to discuss the charges of  your move out beyond our recent phone conversations, please feel free to call the office any time during our normal business hours.

Their front office service is horrible with high turnaround. They never call you back and some of then are flat out rude and have attitude. That and the apartments themselves are super dark inside. I hated being in the kitchen it was so cramped and dark. On top of that every little sound the upstairs neighbors made seemed to make it through to my place as far as walking around or moving stuff. The window in my bedroom would even rattle from the movement.<//text>

<review>First let us start off with the dogs. We dig the dogs that visit us but there a lot that roam off leash and jump into our pond late at night causing a terrible rukus. Annoying and not allowing anyone a peaceful rest. How rude. Now on to the cars that drive way too fast! Hello we are walking here and trying to cross the street with our being run over jeez. Also there are always cars parked by the red lines that say fire lane. Cars almost hit each other because there isn’t enough room to squeeze by! It’s almost like it’s should be illegal or something... this always happens near the play ground where the little kids play to! Weekends when it’s the best time to sleep in is almost always interrupted by some weed whakers or lawn mowers. Guess we’ll wake up now even though the dog woke us up late last night. Sometimes our water gets shut off and we don’t understand why. We would like  a quick soak before starting our day but can’t because there wasn’t a proper warning of the shut off :( guess we will have to leave feeling dirty. Also in the spring don’t come too close to the pond many of the young don’t make it and it’s not a nice sight to see. Oh dear. Sorry for messing up the pond and pool so much. The bad food makes our tummies hurt and we can’t digest it properly! Anyways...
Hope to see you all soon!
Sincerely, Park place Ducks <3<//review>< rating>

< Review>
UPDATE: At first I really hated this apartment, but we got a new property manager -- Jamie and she is amazing! She is ready to take on the challenge of improving this place and I believe she is off to a great start! She organized a free Taco-truck for the entire neighborhood and it was amazing! She takes care of business and any request super fast (that same day). The apartments will be getting new double-glass windows this year (better on that SMUD bill) and fresh new paint on the outside!  looking forward to enjoying this place more than I have before! She is really trying her best to make this place a great home for many. We just need to give her a chance to improve this place like never before :)

DON’T MOVE HERE!!! I moved in to these apartments in December and if I would have read these comments I wouldn’t choose these apartments and saved myself the headache! They look great on the outside and seem nice on the inside but it’s NOT that amazing!  Not only are the apartments expensive, but I also had to pay SMUD $170 one month because the windows are SO thin and cheap so it’s cold in the house bc it all goes through and doesn’t keep the temperature well balanced. If you heat up the house the room is still cold because of the stupid thin window. Also you can not only hear but FEEL each stump of the upstairs neighbor that doesn’t give a cramp about you asking them to walk more lightly b/c each stump is so annoying to hear! And the neighbor apparently can’t sit still at all she has to walk around all day that she’s home! So disturbing!
Wish I could move out if it wasn’t for the stupid 14 month LEASE contract!!!!!!</Review>

<userid>111101079230405317910</userid><review>This place is ran by communist people .
We are not allowed to have anything on our back patio. There is a blonde  lady that doesn't  even work for the apartments that rides around on a golf cart harassing everyone i just filmed her yelling at an extremely nice lady that was smoking a  cigarette in her truck way in the parking lot. The blonde lady in her golf cart yelled at her telling her she is not allowed  to smoke anywhere on the facility and if she catches her again she will make sure management kickes her out. Once again that lady don't even work here and when i complained to the office about the harrassment they pretty much laughed at me . Please take videos and photos if you live here and build a case because this is harrassment  and we are American  we have rights.< /review>< Pics>

<review>If you don't want your car broken into or stolen...DO NOT RENT AN APARTMENT HERE!!! On average it happens once a week. I have personally had it happen to me twice in one year. I have had four guests to my house that had their windows broken into and EVERY single neighbor I know has had the same experience. The management has completely ignored the renters repeated requests for night parking-lot security patrol. They rather charge us a mandatory $26/month fee for taking our garbage from the front door to the trash bin even though most tenants don't want or use the service. In July they posted that we would finally have security and they have since changed their minds. Here is a picture of what happened just a couple of weeks ago and management continues to ignore the problem<//review>< Gmap_id>

<review>First time I tried "Stinky tofu!". I was surprised because the food was so delicious; it not stink at all. At first, my cousin and me just ordered 2 plates. Then we ended up eating 4 plates of Stinky tofu.

Good service!

Parking: easy to find.

Location: hidden place, just following the smell. You will understand what I mean when you get there.

Definitely come back!!!</review>< pics>

I went there last weekend.  The stinky tofu is really good. ($6.25 I believe)  I also ordered mushroom pork rice too. The mushroom pork rice is really good too cost like $4.50, but the portion is small.  I would recommend it to anyone if you like Taiwanese food.< /review>

<review>I went there with my mom because I was craving some stinky tofu. I knew it was somewhere in this plaza,  and just like Toucan Sam, I just had to follow my nose. This is kind of a hole in the wall restaurant, and you and you can see the cooks are literally behind a literal hole in the wall. Super authentic! the Stinky Tofu was great, it was sitting in a sweet and sour sauce with some crunchy cabbage mix on the side of the plate. my mom also wanted to try the Rou Yuan, which I wasn't too keen on. it came out looking like a gray glutinous rice ball which enveloped a meat ball.  I couldn't bring myself to eat it. the picture on the menu made it look alost edible, but when it came out looking gray and gelatinous, I couldn't. I had to ask the lady four times to refill my cup of water. she filled it up three times. we were one of two tables that needed to be waited upon. yet I still had to keep asking for water. so the service was lacking, the presentation of the Rou Yuan and apparently the texture was off. my dad said that it was hard. he actually couldn't eat it either. But the stinky tofu hit the spot. service 1 star. ambiance 1 star. stinky tofu 4.5 stars. at least the tofu at tofu king didn't suck. just everything else did.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwopIDMlX59VAhonDp6kqh6CqmhI8jpTH0kCvz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyY7Zsu_bG3sb6yTV_uMLLQucwdwxhJM2sDIbl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPuo97B8_T9dK4pLbTiB4yyFpcrLL6SCGrVUzx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ5btzgQ93x5wvycPfYYhlY9zjZte7vCUVJX5u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4Ru6P1NZ5QvGb-NnUi45p6-JW_FfooY_k7egz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3jHCwbbSmQoOJ5bX0ES_ab1WXH2x7TDomrVQX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQe2VIvkNd0tAWPBX30UnZySisw-3PLQkqsV-Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfghXHvyNVH-K5hUw5ezAF5VIEoWaZqrztqVoz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSQXHPUb0s2-BWVv6cCLYtorMLMxYYDEQC2zSu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><date>1488589554265< /date><response>None<//response><user_name>SHERWIN KEAK<//user_name>< userid>

<Text>Their Stinky Tofu's not bad for the first couple of bites but then the tofu got really soggy because of tremendous amount of soy sauce underneath. The tofu absorbed it all in within seconds. I wish they would leave that part to the customers. Maybe give us a separate "sauce" dish to put the soy sauce in. I like my fried stinky tofu to be crispy on the outside.< /Text>< Pictures>

If you ask for the most authentic Taiwan stinky tofu in LA, this is the place. Restaurant is small. The waitress is nice. Food is good. Every time I am here I order their tofu and pork feet rice. I will say the tofu qty is good to share with. Sometimes they might over fried the tofu so it is kind of firm.  Otherwise everything about the tofu is perfect< /Text>

<Text>Small place, sort of hidden near the back half of a walkway.  The service was very friendly, and the stinky tofu was awesome.  We also ordered veggies, Taiwanese Meatball, and the Mala Tofu.  All the food was good.  Would definitely try to go back again before we leave SoCal.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

Pro: This place resembles those food stands in Taiwan.
Con: This place resembles those food stands in Taiwan.

Let me explain.

The literal hole-in-the-wall fits about 9 people maximum inside, but they also have a few picnic tables outside for its patrons. When we arrived, there were no inside seats available, so we were planning on sitting outside until we saw bugs sprinkled all over the tables like black sesame seeds on rice. One would think that would be enough to turn us around, but sometimes when you're stomach speaks, your brain doesn't listen.

The only thing I can say about the food is that it's not bad. The fried stinky tofu is pretty good, but can, depending on the batch, be greasy or dry. The other items were nothing to write home about.

Those who claim Tofu King has an authentic taste have probably forgotten just how good Taiwanese street food really is. True, this place might be as close as it gets on this side of the Pacific, but if you go expecting too much, you'll be disappointed.</Text>

Authentic and good service, you can smell the stinky tofu from the parking lot and it was glorious.  My family had 3 servings plus other traditional Taiwanese street foods.< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Decent food but horrible service. My mother asked only for a larger box which was given to her on previous visits, but was rudely denied this time. A lady claimed to be the owner's daughter put the hot tofu in plastic boxes which leaked due to the heat. My mom asked her for a new one. She took the boxes and THREW the tofu box on the floor and told my mom "no one asked you to come visit, you dont have to come visit." 她说我是老板的女儿，把豆腐摔倒地上告诉我们没人请你来啊，你不用来。服务很差，不尊重客人，不要去吃。<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

David, Bao and the team at audiomobile never disappoint.  I went in for full drop in speakers and a foot well light kit and I was blown away by the quality of their work and professionalism.  Highly recommend them to anyone who is serious about making their car more enjoyable.  :). Thank you, audiomobile!</review>

<Text>So far not a good experience. My interaction with David was great. He was friendly and knowledgeable. Thought I was getting a deal, that is until I left with a set of speakers that I then googled.  I can get them for between $35 & $45 online all day. He charged me $100.  I called abd he says he will give me a refund. We shall see.<//Text><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>102211146343754710116</user_id>< user_name>

<userid>111365606970518771193< /userid><Review>Came in to get bluetooth installed in my car. They did the job but it had turned out that the system they installed was pretty finicky. HOWEVER, they went above and beyond to correct - getting a new system and installing free of charge. They were super communicative and when the install was finally finished, they even called me the next day to let me know that I'd left my plant starter in their waiting room. Sweet guys, great service.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808f80b5b0873d91:0x8ba01ccc701cc699<//gmap_id><response>None< /response>< name>

I called them this morning and I was lucky they fit me in. My 1990 car came with a nice Clarion cassette... (Sarcasm).. I ordered a Pioneer Deh-8800. They said they could swap it in an hr!! ...they did it. The guys at the shop know what they are doing for sure.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Great place to go, I bought a android screen for my car, every car stereo I called to install my android system, they told me that they can't install my system because it is really hard to be installed. Went to other place, the guy didn't know what I was talking about. He was telling me some funny things that it didn't even make sense to me. But these guys are professionals, they installed my android screen about two and a half hour great timing, great experience, and great pricing. Thank you very much.< /text>< Pictures>

I wanted a cheap alarm, but David showed me one just a little more $ that I am delighted with. Then I had them install new speakers so I can hear music better. I also got a portable emergency battery that is a jumper cable alternative. It made me popular with my neighbors!</text>

The worst place to go to get anything done. They are thieves. They told me I have to spend $200 to fix my screen when it was a 40 bucks fix. If u need anything done to your stereo go to AAA car stereo in San Leandro he got the fixes for every problem. Unlike this money thirsty people he is very honest and will get u the best fix with an honest price. DO NOT GO TO THIS SHOP UNLESS YOU ARE TRYING TO GET ROBBED.</Review>

You're stuck in traffic! What better way to spend the time then listening to high quality Audio. I got my fiance this gift and when I picked him up at the airport with his favorite song on- he exclaimed WOW! He noticed the great audio before he even said hello! Also David will keep your hands free with mobile devices. Excellent service.</text>

I insisted on having an old cassette player installed in my '96 Ranger. The parts were hard to come by, I bought the wrong things several times, etc. Audiomobile special ordered the correct adapter for me and took the time to hunt down an amplifier so my tape deck could actually get put to use! These guys are extremely nice, professional, caring, and patient. Not once did they try to talk me out of my complicated plan; they suggested alternative systems only attempting to make it more convenient for me, but did not try to sell me anything I didn't want. I will absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for a great audio installation place. Thank you for everything!</review>

I have been to this place 3 times now, and I have always left with disappointment. The first time I walked in, I had them put new speakers in my car. They weren’t sounding very good, so I went back and they said I needed a new stereo too. This made the sound even worse than before, so I went back to ask for a refund. They refused. I asked that they at least just put my old speaker setup back together, which they charged me to do, AND NOW THE SPEAKERS ARE COMPLETELY BROKEN! Terrible service, definitely one of my worst shopping experiences of all time.< /review></record>

I visited 4 different installers between Oakland and Concord and chose Audiomobile for my high-end sound upgrade for my 2007 Subaru WRX STI. These guys are really great. They are an authorized Focal dealer (and as true audiophiles know, Focal speakers are some of the very best in the world). I wanted a near-stealth installation with components in the front, coaxials in the rear and very clean amplification for a hi-fidelity sound to the best extent possible given my budget and the fact that I don't want to sacrifice trunk space for a sub. So rich mids and low-mids were a main consideration. I had also installed (myself) an Alpine CDE-HD149BT which has a 9-band parametric EQ and as a home studio owner I know something about EQing frequencies.

They spent a lot of time with me going over options to achieve what I wanted (at least two hours in the listening rooms and at the counter).

I give an Excellent rating to their Service, because they truly listened and engaged me in a conversation about what I wanted instead of trying to upsell me on something I didn't want. I researched their recommendations that evening online (components, various installation options which affected cost) and saw that the Rockford Fosgate T-600-4 was very highly rated for clean sound and would pair well with the Focal Performance series.

I requested a custom tweeter installation into the A-pillar at a 30-degree offset (since these Focal tweeters are aluminum, they are highly directional).  I am so impressed with the quality of the workmanship here. They custom-fabricated a fiberglass housing so beautifully that the tweeters look like they came as part of the car, so a casual observer walking by doesn't notice a custom install.

The amplifier was securely mounted under the passenger seat (no holes drilled in the car). The power and audio cable was installed as expected, running down separate sides of the car. The active crossover on the HU were set correctly to match the passive crossovers that came with the Focals in the front. They deadened vibration and road noise in the doors with Dynomat (equiv.), which has made a tremendous difference in the WRX STI's typical road noise.

When I picked up the vehicle, the car interior was clean and nearly looked stock (obviously with the exception of the tweeter installs and my Head Unit). They took the time to sit with me and go over some of the tuning options and we played around with my parametric to experiment. This step is necessary because each car stereo owner has different ears, different tastes in music and different preferences. So generally, the frequency response was good. I had already planned to set up the timing data and parametric EQ myself.

After more than a month with this installation, my new sound system has a lot of power (not only necessary for making things loud, but absolutely necessary for driving the speakers very cleanly; more power means less stress on the amp at higher volumes). The sound is phenomenal.  I have the EQ dialed in to a point where vocals and low-mids have good presence on the front sound stage. I gave a little boost around 3.2Khz to bring out the harmonic characteristics of guitars and synths. The tweeters are very direct, so I dropped 4Khz, 9Khz and 16Khz at a moderate Q setting to reduce sibilance, cymbals and ring that can be painful at those frequencies. The overall result is nicely balanced sound.

Really happy, I would definitely go back to Audiomobile.<//Review>

We ate at this restaurant the day before yesterday and had a great time. The food was delectable and tantalizing. I feel compelled to remind everyone that the workers treated me with respect and professionalism. They were a lot of fun to be around and always put the customer first. Thank you so much for providing such excellent service!<//Review>

The lady that works here makes the best frijoles ever! They tasted so fresh it was like she just made them or something. It seems like her Guatemalan sour cream is homemade too, it was softer than the store bought ones around town, probably because there were no preservatives in it.
She also made my eggs just the way I like them, with onion and tomatoes, scrambled.<//Review>

If you have not tried Guatemalan tamales, you have to try them, they are good and everything else.
I have about 40 years old that I came from my country and I had to go to San Francisco for bread and to eat some Guate, but today it is here in the meridian.

This place has an amazing location and fun seating options for groups and couples. The service was very friendly, too. We only had wine, which was all great. The charcuterie others had also looked good.</Text>

<text>This is a great location! Very close to our hotel and the super cute inside. There are multiple seating choices (try the upstairs balcony) and the staff is ready with wine knowledge and offers of how to enjoy your wine, glass, bottle or flights.  They do have a menu with multiple options to choose from. Thank you to Jo for taking care of us!< /text>< Response>

My husband and I are new residents to South Lake Tahoe and we wanted to try this place out! Don't get me wrong - the setting was great along the water, but like some of the other reviews, we were young and it felt like all the servers catered to the more "prestige". We had a beautiful spot designated to us, but were basically pressured into giving it up to accommodate a larger group. Our food came, and I asked for hot sauce and a refill of my champagne and the server never came back. We waited about 30 minutes to where my pizza was cold and no libation. We ended up going back upstairs to pay our bill and were still ignored. No apologies for forgetting about the little people, nothing. I'm not one to post reviews. In fact, I've probably only posted one or two in my life, but I was very disappointed in the service. I'd really like to take my dad to this place because again, the view is amazing, but please treat all of your patrons equally.</review>

The Idle Hour is a hidden gem! From the moment you walk inside there is such an inviting decor. Patty and Jenny make you feel welcome and provide excellent customer service. We chose the wine flight with the upgrade of Silver Oaks and Camus. ( Sauvignon Blanc, Vermintino, Chardonnay, Rose, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet and Zinfandel ) The roasted red pepper & tomato soup is delicious, along with the artichoke dip/flatbread and a sausage quesadilla. The rum filled Abdallah Chocolates provided a sweet ending! We sat along the outside balcony with a gorgeous view of Lake Tahoe. Having enjoyed ourselves so much,  we returned a second day to sit downstairs at beach level. Make time to stop here and you'll know why their name is a perfect fit!</Text>

My first time visiting Lake Tahoe was amazing. Every place was great except this place, I’m still waiting for a menu. After seeing other patrons pay their bills at the end of stay, I was told they have to hold a card, (strike 1) I couldn’t help but feeling upset. Watching other parties being catered to without any problem, as my wife and I ordered our bottle, it was brought out and we were told someone would be coming out with a menu and after the male waiter mentions how cool my Ralph Lauren jacket looked, I guess a bit too urban for their establishment (strike 2) , We were deserted , no one helped us, no one served us after the bottle was brought out, still waiting on a menu (strike 3) Sorry to say do not recommend this place.< /text>

Lovveddd the spot and the vibe. came back again with more friends. quesadilla was nice. tasting is a pretty cute setup. we watched the sunset . it was lovely. P.S. the only feedback is the fondue was just not our kind of 'taste' cheese wise.. also it came with some bread pieces and apple and raw broccoli.. i wish it was cooked at-least lol<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>What a great place!  We stopped by for a glass of wine. Two tastings, a pizza, truffles, and 6 bottles later (most of them to go :-) ) we finally left several hours later. The wine was excellent. We enjoy trying wines from smaller, unique wineries. Bill did a great job telling us about the wine and the wineries they came from. We got a special treat when the owners came in and we enjoyed chatting with them as well. The tasting room is so beautifully decorated, and what a great view, and the sounds of the water hitting the shore was wonderful. We will be back!<//text>< pictures>

First, the positives: the view is amazing and the wine was good! But Every step of the way we were lied to and that’s when we left feeling like “wow, did that really just happen?” I had a bug in my glass of wine and the lady asked if I would like something else...I said yes and when we checked out she still charged us for the glass with the bug in it. Then when checking in on us and we were enjoying our glasses and the view still we were told that “they could always use the table.” We stayed for a bit more to finish our drinks when a different person told us that they had a line out they door and people to get into these tables. We decided to leave and when we went upstairs there was no one, no line out the door and plenty of tables. We mentioned this comment confused to another person who worked there and they said “I didn’t tell them to say that.” At first we thought we found this new gem and now the view isn’t worth the poor hospitality.</review>

<review>Enjoy the perfect view of Lake Tahoe with a personally selected glass of wine. This place is a gem. It opened recently,  so you can still get that perfect spot by the large picture windows. You can do a tasting or have a glass of wine, inside or outside. On Fridays and Saturdays there's live music on the baby grand. Very romantic. Leann will tell you all you need to know about their specialty selected wines. Just Go!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHB8Pyu1nXsBHgqJRhi8Kg_rzoNAGtdg4e8nLH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdvsq1UeuHqLMimm6TvwyLl-ct_RlABDXanH0b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>{'time': 1582480486770, 'text': '🙂'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x809991cdf71ed4b9:0xda1545526792aaf4</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great service! Got a recommendation for our wine 🍷(which was delicious) and had the yummy cheese 🧀 plate! Great little place to stop and see some great views of Lake Tahoe.<//review>

<Review>First time here and we loved it. You can choose to have a flight, a glass, or a bottle. Nice and relaxing with a beautiful view of the lake. BTW they have a really pretty area off the water for that special occasion.<//Review>< pics>

I think we had a new person handling our transaction, but his character was unique and we had a great time. Great balcony views, which we were fortunate to have. And the selection of wines and chocolate were exquisite!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Great selection of wine. Hostess Emily was very knowledgeable and friendly. The views are breathtaking, right on the water, cozy indoor and outdoor seating.
Great place for a tasting and a glass

First off service was horrible. They refused to let me to a wine tasting without buying a cheese tray so I didnt get to do that. The wine choices are absolutely horrible and not to mention for a little wine bar crazy expensive for absolutely everything. I would never recommend this place to anyone. The selection on just a glass of wine is horrible we didnt even stay.< /review>

You get choose 8 of 15 wines by the glass including Caymus, Silver oak, Rambauer,  the list goes on. I did have a new employee on Thursday, but guest service is our number goal. We do have over 160 wines to choose from!!'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I came here at the end of August for a family reunion and we all really enjoyed the venue. We came for the wine tasting which was nice, and ended up buying a couple of bottles and a couple of yummy pizzas and hung out on the downstairs outdoor patio.  It is right on the lake with a beautiful view of the water. We came back the next day because we like the venue so much. I can’t wait to come back again.

I absolutely loved this wine bar! They have the best selection around of wine and sparkling wine, all hand-selected by the wine enthusiast owners! I was so excited to hear that they select most of their wines from local vineyards as well. The staff were all warm and inviting, and very knowledgable about their products! Leanne was my favorite!

The decor is beautiful and you literally cannot ask for better views. You are as close to the lake as you can get without getting wet. Sunsets are spectacular! And to top it all off, they have an event center! I can't imagine a more beautiful and scenic place to get married! I only wish I knew about this place when I got married!

Overall, this is an amazing hidden gem, perfect for a sophisticated night on the town. The atmosphere is low-key and laid back. The pianist tickling the ivories on the grand piano helped of course! I will be back! This is now my go-to spot!<//review>

< review>
My kids have been patients of this dental office for a few years and the experience has always been exemplary. We have been to both offices and at each location reception staff greet you immediately and check in/out process has always been quick. The dental aides/hygienists have all been very caring with both of my kids. Dr. Pat is has one of the best bedsides manners out of all the doctors my family has worked with. They are professional, hard working and thorough. I appreciate how the staff has adapted in addressing my daughter and the responsibility of oral hygiene as she is getting older. I also appreciate the patience and approach they use with my son who has autism. I highly recommend this dental office.< /review>

<Text>Staff is professional and friendly. My foster son had his one year check up and just completed another check up for two bottom teeth at 17 months. They have a nice open waiting room so he was able to walk around as we waited. They also have a token machine with little toys in the waiting area. The doctors are easy to work with and very patient with screaming babies. I feel comfortable here an taken care of so I don't need to look for other dentists!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

See my Yelp review! They are the best! Patient, withhold moral standards working with children.  The whole staff is Amazing as well as their Chula Vista location. I can’t say enough but they have brought my trust back in pediatric dentistry! I would ‘t take them anywhere else.</Text>

I was referred by a friend that worked for Dr. Pat and she always had so many great things to say about everyone at Sweetwater Pediatric Dentistry. I decided to check it out and I am so happy I did. From the first visit I knew I made the right choice by switching. They are so awesome, they are always so friendly and nice. Everyone always has a smile and are so attentive. I love how they have tv’s on the ceiling it’s such a great distraction for the kids and they get to choose from different up
to date movies. My kids don’t mind going to the dentist anymore because Dr. Pat and his staff make it a great experience. We love it there!!  Oh and they definitely keep everything sanitized and clean, all staff is wearing masks shields and gloves. :-)<//text></record></dataset><record>

The dentist assistant and the dentist are so patient with kids and take the time to help the kids cope with what needs to be done to their teeth. My daughter is afraid of dentist just because she has not had very good experience with them and even just her teeth being brushed she starts crying. As for my 2 year old it was his first time to see the dentist and he brushed his teeth and took the time to look at his teeth. I am glad I found this dentist it really seems like they actually care for their patients and don't pressure you into getting procedures done right away if they can avoid doing something that on the long run could affect the kid in the future they try and find another solution. The dentist before would just push and push for the producers to be done there and than and wouldn't explain anything.< /Text>

So....I had been calling all around town to get a double appointment for my two kids for the same time and they had an appointment for a couple days out. I went ahead and took it.

When I showed up, they were completely compliant with the Covid standards and procedures. Staff was very professional. Everyone wearing face masks. The dental seats were separated by plexiglass. The lady who attended my son was very nice, she tried to make him comfortable.

My toddler was a little squirmy but the lady was very calm and understanding.

Then the Doctor came in. Dr. Pat. My son loved him. He talked to my son, explained things he should do and shouldn’t do. My son was pleased with his dental visit. He is even looking forward to seeing him in the next 6 months for his routine cleaning. I am recommending this place to family and friends if they need a pediatric dental appointment.<//Review>

<Review>I was recommended to Dr. Pat and his team by a friend after a bad experience at another popular children’s dentistry office. Since the first visit over 5 years ago, the entire staff has always been very friendly and caring. They are not in it for the money, they care for their patients and do not do any unnecessary treatments like others do. Thank you Dr. Pat and your entire staff for always going above and beyond!</Review>< pics>

The Dr. and all the Staff are so Professional, they're patient and kind,  they answered all my questions very clearly. Some important  points too is that at your appointment time is not 20 kids waiting with the same time of your appointment, the place is clean, is a lot of parking and is easy to get there.
As a Mom I totally recommend.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This place is great! My son has special needs and is quite sensitive to sedation so naturally, I was nervous but they were checking in with me every step of the way  and reassured me about the procedure. The staff was so professional and attentive. I Love this place, I cannot stress enough how valuable this kind of service is to parent with kids with hyper sensitivity.< /text>

<review>Sweetwater Pediatric Dentistry is super Awesome! Customer service is great, especially Miss Jackie! Always welcoming and makes you feel comfortable! Staff, Miss Clara and Miss Myra are such great Assistants too. Never rushing, and always empathetic to my kids! When my four children gets their checkups, they are calm and comfortable. Place is very  neat and clean. If your children go to THE SUPER DENTIST, Stop and take them Here! Great customer service, and of course the best Dentist, DR PAT!! My kids love Dr. PAT! Always welcoming, concern and very caring!! If you are looking for a great place to take you kids, I recommend SPD!!!</review><user_name>Daxking1234x</user_name>< pics>

Amazing customer service! The receptionist (Jackie), dentist assistant Clara and Dr. Pat were super awesome and friendly! My kids love going to their dental appt! The location is a little bit hard to find at first but it’s just above Navy Federal in Sweetwater.. Felt very safe during our appointment given their COVID precautions and protocols.< /text>

The entire office and doctor is so nice. They are all easy to talk to and make everything clear about treatment and next steps. Their office is pristine and super clean. They have plenty of tv’s for the kids to watch in the waiting room and at the treatment areas. I recommend them to a lot of my family and friends!</review>

Felt super at ease, and I'm thankful they did not criticize me harshly or should I say DID NOT AT ALL 🙏. I knew that my little girls teeth had a some cavities But they were really great about it telling me everything about what was going on with her teeth and my daughter told me that she had a really great day as soon as we left from there as I was putting her seat belt on which made me smile and I told her I'm glad you had a great day. I know shes looking forward to going there again<//text>

I was extremely disappointed at how the dentist spoke to my 5vyear old son. He was given the laughing gas and was numbed. However he was still uncomfortable and began to cry. The dentist told him that "that's what you get because you don't isten to mom and brush your teeth." I cringed becauae in fact my son always listens to me when it comes to brushing he's teeth. Then he t's me he was crying a lot because he's used to doing so and getting what he wants. Then he recommended me holding him down, even though it may traumatize him. Obviously I don't want to traumatize my 5 year old son and left. There was one dental assistant who seems to truly care and made it a point to ask why he wasn't sedated. I went back to get copies of my kids' xrays. I cancelled my other son's appointment and would never be back there again.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The best place to take your children, they feel comfortable. The staff there are looking for a way to give the children confidence. They look for treatment options. They are careful when working, they have assistance if you do not master the language. I am fascinated with coming here. They give small gifts to children with extraordinary kindness.

Son cuidadosos ala hora de trabajar, tienen asistencia si no dominas el idioma. Estoy fascinada con venir aquí. Dan pequeños obsequios a los niños con una amabilidad extraordinaria.< /text>

Was my first time here and everything my friend told me about Otto was true — he’s a great guy! He complimented me on my CANADA sweater and was super helpful.

I got their Magic Cup of Health and the Lox Plate from their specials menu! I was thoroughly satisfied with the food, drinks, and cozy vibes.

If I lived closer I’d be a local. 😉< /review>

Otto has given Park St. an amazing place for community. He is there most times, which is rare to see an owner there on a consistent basis. He and his employees are very friendly and kind, especially Josh. We go there often for their fun, local gatherings. Drinks are fresh and natural; I even got a drink named after me- try "Aimee's Apple Cider". I love that we can walk in there and Otto knows us and so many other patrons on a first name basis. Love love love The Local.<//text>

We've been back several times since they reconfigured for covid.  All of their staff consistently wear masks correctly. Their drinks are always good as are the food options.</Text>

<review>This shop is lovely.  It has a really friendly vibe, and a lot of people were seeing people the knew and saying hi.  It feels like how everyone thinks a small town feels.  The coffee was good and the service was friendly.  I would definitely go out of my way to visit again.</review>< Pics>

The name of this coffee shop is appropriate.  Owned by local resident Otto Wright, it feels local and genuine. If you like supporting small businesses and want a solid cup of coffee,  pastries and sandwiches that will satisfy, come here and be happy.<//text>

Awesome spot to study and get some work done.

Was surprised at their egg and cheese bagel. Super creamy eggs with melted cheddar on top. Nice quick bite during my time there.

Will definitely be coming back.< /text>

The smoothies here are great and decently creative. Prices are right. Had one bad experience here where they literally forgot about me. The place was dead and it took 20 minutes for my smoothie to be ready and then when I asked about my bagel, (toasted with butter) they said "oops technical difficulties" and then I waited another 15 minutes for my bagel before asking again and seeing that it had popped out of the toaster and been forgotten there. Service is good most of the time.<//Review>

Good place to hang out with your friends, they have plenty of free board games. There are options for drinks and food. Cons of this place are little bit loud and no effort in decoration. No matching furniture at all.</text>

<Review>The thing about the Local is it's always great. The staff are warm and happy, the food is top notch and the drinks areare alw spot on. My personal favorites are the Bronze Coast smoothie and Cup of Health, served hot. And Otto, the owner, happens to be incredibly generous to our community to boot!< /Review></record>

<Time>1560011207915</Time><Text>Ordered a vegetarian bagel and the guy put bacon on it. I told him about it and he literally just took it off with his bare hands and gave it back to me. Guess it’s my bad for expecting him to put in some effort and make a new one. Best part? I paid $2 extra for avocado and got 3 of the saddest brown slices I’ve ever seen. At least when I pay extra for guac at Chipotle I get my money’s worth. Avoid if you expect decent service and food. Sad.<//Text>< pics>

Tasty coffee, great staff & a terrific environment to relax over something tasty & refreshing. It has become an instant favorite of mine. I plan on stopping by whenever I'm on Alameda or am traveling through the area (& I live in the South Bay).< /text>

The beating heart of Alemeda, coffee food and beer, plus Otto supports the local community with the Local. From kids to Coastguards, all local produce where possible... Live music and comedy, every town should have a local!< /review>

The espresso was tasty (although a bit weak for a double shot). It's definitely more of a no-frills spot than up-market.</text>

Ok coffee. Problem was only one bathroom with a local special needs person who bought nothing and was allowed to go clean up and change clothes and make five people wait about 10 minutes. There was a street fair and porta potties all over. The owner made all of us waiting wrong for going to him to complain. Have run businesses in Alameda and customers come first. Why one bathroom anyway?< /Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>(Translated by Google) Great coffee and good blueberry danish for me. Fresh squeezed orange juice and chocolate croissants both approved with full marks by my daughter (5 years old).
Nice place, clean and spacious.
Super friendly service.
A very pleasant experience!

(Original)
Ottimo caffè e buona danish ai mirtilli per me. Spremuta fresca di arance e croissant al cioccolato entrambi approvati a pieni voti da mia figlia (5 anni).
Bel locale, pulito e spazioso.
Servizio super amichevole.
Un'esperienza decisamente piacevole!<//text>< Name>

Excellent online order and pick up. They have parking spots right in front of the restaurant for pick up. Very friendly.  Only thing I wish they had more employees working. I was waiting for a while to get my food and I could see there were only 2 employees working in the front,  taking orders, prepping orders and answering phones.<//review>

<review>Really disappointed, I love ihop but service in this partícular restaurant wasn’t what I specked I order Swedish crepes that’s what I like but i always ask them to prepare then fresh recently made I don’t like them hard and the waitress told me that’s all they have they have them already made and they look dark and they were hard, I think that’s what I’m paying for to eat fresh food and food that I like.< /review>< pictures>

This visit was my first to this location. A lot of free parking available for customers. Waiter was friendly and prompt. Food was fresh and good. At the end stuff presented my little daughter a bunch of air balloons - she was happy to get it! Thank you for that attention to us.
But I would like to mention few points:
* A knife was under our table left by someone from previous customers.
* Waiter mixed up our order and brought us wrong coffee.
* Our entree was brought without garlic bread (on the menu it goes with it)
* Our Crêpes was brought under strawberry topping (we ordered it under raspberry topping).
* Waiter hasn't left us those peace of receipt with the survey...

Overall impression is positive, but it would be better if there would be less confusion from stuff about the orders.</text>

This restaurant will treat you like you are the most important person in the world! The service was outstanding. The food was an experience from start to finish, and the wine that was suggested was perfect for the meal. I am a true foodie, so for me to say this is the best meal I've ever had. We all loved it, and I cannot wait to come back.<//Text>

<Review>The staff is very friendly and helpful but the food portions are not as generously served as they once were and everything is quite pricey. For example, if you order the                                                                                     thanks giving dinner they only serve you enough food to cover the bottom of the plate. In other words, they only give you two spoonfuls of each accompaniment. Just for those nearly empty plates of food they charged my mom and me $30.00. On Thursday we came back here to order a meat omelette, a plate with two eggs, two hash browns and a few pieces of ham with one ssaussage link and two strawberry shakes. Just for those to nearly empty plates of food and the two shakes they charged us $50.00. I sincerely believe that coming to eat here is a ripoff. I highly recommend the house of pies on vermont and Franklin because it is alot cheaper and they fill your food plates all the way to the top. This chain of restaurants charges for its food as if it was made of gold and I don't thing it is fair because they charge you quite alot for a nearly empty plate and they leave you very hungry in return.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>I called a few days ago to see if I could order for pick-up. I was driving home and would be passing by the restaurant on the way so it was very convenient for me. A (what sounded like) younger man answered the phone and told me in his "too cool laissez-faire expression" just that no I couldn't I had "to use an app" (like postmatez, door dash, etc.). I explained I was driving by there and ask if there was any way they would do a pick-up order at all. He sounded annoyed and exasperated (I could just see his eyes roll to the back of his head... and get stuck that way lol) he told me again to "use an app". I finally tried once more, saying, "yes ok I will order on an app but is your restaurant doing pick-up orders at all or do I have to order it for delivery?" The only answer I received was an obnoxious, slightly muffled, little giggle and, of course, "use an app." Needless to say I passed on pancakes that evening. There's no dining-in currently allowed because of COVID, so I know he was not busy with customers everywhere, getting in his face. A 2 min phone phone call that could have been managed by answering a yes or no question should not be too much customer service to expect. Take a little pride in your work and at least try to offer some full sentences in response to customer inquiry. Its not asking much.</text>< pictures>

Our waiter was very polite with us since we got there. The wait time for the food was not bad at all and we had at least 4  Stake and Eggs. The food itself was pretty good as well. We even spend more time that we should have just catching up with old friends and they didn't tell us anything 😁< /text>

Had a very bad experience with this particular IHOP. First, we ordered online and part of one of the meals was missing. When we called the employee on the other line either didn't understand what we were saying or was just not listening. On top of that this guy was speaking in a very disrespectful tone to my dad when they were conversing, refused to allow him to speak with a manager and straight up hung up on him. We called back and asked to speak with someone else and luckily the other employee was able to sort things out, but still there was no reason for the first guy to be so disrespectful in the first place because my dad was not being rude. Then we get to the food, I know IHOP is not supposed to be high quality food but the meals themselves looked as if they were just thrown into the containers, fries and scrambled eggs all over the place. In addition another person in our group ordered a sandwich with avocado and surprise, surprise no avocado, which is the whole reason she ordered it to begin with. Look I understand that things are difficult for everybody right now but there's no excuse to be so unprofessional.

P.S. have a great day to whoever reads this, hope things go well for you< /review>

This place is great for dinner almost empty after noon. I don't recommend coming here in the morning unless you want to have to wait between 15 min to an hour. The wait staff is nice and the place is clean. They have high chairs for toddlers and a discount for 55+ year olds.<//text>

Food was okay ; substitute my hash brown for mashed potatoes w/ country gravy . Mash potatoes was not fully done well. We felt rushed the whole time , we got our food and 5 mins later they brought the check . Charged us and in the middle of still trying to eat they came back to pick up the receipt. NOT COMING BACK<//review>

That one star is being generous. WAY overrated !! I went went the other day with a friend and neither of us had a big appetite. We each had a short stack with a cup of coffee. 19.44 !! Can you believe that ! Wow ☹ I sure didn't see that one coming. Thanks IHOP for making my wallet 20 dollars lighter for a couple of peices bread and a cup of coffee.< /text>

<review>We came here during DineLA week and the options they had for the special menu were excellent. We all got something different and I went with anything that had short rib. I'm a short rib fiend so I was excited there were so many options for it. Everything was tasty and service was wonderful. I'd be back for sure.<//review><user_id>104932280659961522698< /user_id>< date>

<review>No the chicken does not stack up to the pancakes. As a long time ihop fan I decided to come here for dinner to try their new buffalo chicken sandwich on a brioche bun. Unfortunately the buffalo flavor completely overwhelmed the sandwich and couldn’t really taste the actual chicken too much.

Sorry ihop but stick to the pancakes

1 year update:

Came back and tried their seasoned grilled chicken. Very delicious and drastic improvement compared to my last experience as noted above. Almost ordered pancakes but so glad I ordered this chicken sandwich instead. 5 stars.<//review>< pics>

<text>The food is good the place has it all for eating, only thing is that it's too sweet at times, for instance the pancakes are too sweet or the flavored coffee/hot chocolates. I have sugar to add on if it lacks. Good for groups and breakfast no doubt. Employees are very helpful and make great suggestions too. Please check it out for yourself soon.

We were seated quickly and cordially.  I had their cannoli pancakes for the first time. They were super delicious! Then I asked for a side of bacon - crispy- and they made it perfectly crispy.  The waitress was friendly and the ambiance is very pleasant. I highly recommend it. Parking is free and plentiful.<//Review>

Great and Friendly Staff, never rude, the tables and bathrooms are always clean. depending on the day you arrive and time you may have a bit of a wait but never longer than 5-10 minutes tops. they have an outside seating area in the company of a large tree that gives the experience a little something extra. Plenty of parking and convenient located near gas stations and freeway on and off ramps.</text>

One of the night shift guys was not giving me any good vibes at all. His body language was annoying, and he gave me an annoyed look when I asked for takeout. He gave me a huge sigh as I was reading the menu, as well as, gave me an annoyed look when I asked for vanilla for my coffee.

Love the customizable menu! Was trying to find something healthy to eat and found a egg white veggie omelette option which was absolutely delicious.</Text>

I sat at the counter because I was in a hurry. After the check finished making my food, I saw it sit there for longer than 5 minutes while the staff were hanging out and socializing. They finally brought me my food and it was not very warm. Then when I was done eating, I had to wait a long time for somebody to come give me my check and take my money. Then oh, she did not bring me my full change she only gave me the dollars and left out the Loose Change. I had to ask her for the loose change. Not cool</text>

Food and service was better than expected for an odd location (by the 110-S). Our server was very attentive and friendly towards us. The food was hot and fresh, although it took a while for it to be ready. My assumption was they were understaffed as there were only two other parties in the whole restaurant. We went on a weekday late afternoon so that could be the reason. Either way it's conveniently located near my home. Best place for munchies.< /Review>

<text>Absolutely worst service. Tried this place after they changed their name to IHOB. Ordered burger, been waiting for 30 minutes and all we got is soggy fries and soda never be served. Will not come to this place again.< /text>< pictures>

Honestly I came in pretty lit with a few pals (who were also lit) and couldn’t even make an order without bursting into laughter. But they were extremely cool about it!! God bless IHOP, one of the great wonders of the world, to be sure.</Text>

Excellent service, on a Saturday morning during a holiday weekend. Upon arrival from our 6 hours drive from northern California, we were greeted and seated promptly. Our waiter immediately asked and brought over our drinks, and our order arrived soon after having placed our order.< /Text>

One of the best spots of its kind in the area. I will be back with my friends. Prices are appropriate for the quality. They have so many reviews for a reason.<//review>

What can I say about IHOP? The food taste pretty much the same no matter which IHOP location you are visiting. What can I say about this particular IHOP? When it's late night and you aren't quite ready to let the night end this is a great place to keep the night going. It is full of shady individuals who usually keep to themselves. Nothing fancy no glamour but just a place to eat something to keep the night going.<//Text>

<name>Mark< /name><Text>Very big IHOP. A little bit bigger than what I'm use to. Service here was phenomenal. Food was good as well. We did send back our hashbrowns bc they were too lightly cooked/colored & cold. We love our hash to be a little crispy. Ours weren't crispy at all. Pancakes & Eggs were a ten and hot. Bacon could be thicker but always tasty at IHOP.

Its 24 hours! Plenty of parking and the restaurant isn't in a super busy area with heavy heavy traffic. Would definitely come to this location again.<//Text>< time>

<Text>It's a very busy place.  We were seated about 10 minutes after we signed in. We were offered our drinks about 5 minutes after being seated. At this point customers were being seated at the two tables around us. The waiter took our order 5 minutes after our drinks arrived. 5 minutes later the two tables around us recieved their orders. By the time we got our order another 5 minute had passed. Although it was busy, they were not understaffed.< /Text>< pictures>

Five stars for service!! Went there on Xmas eve at around 2am. It didn't seem that because we were one of three tables there that the service was great, I think the waiters personality is the same whether it's 2am or 2pm.< /text>

<Review>They usually let me customize my order with no problems. Can get busy with a line during peak times, so service is slow once in a while. Outdoor patio. Seems to have better food than other IHOPs. Coffee is usually crappy, but they give you a whole lot at your table. I love the flavored syrups.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Today's visit was not what we are used to. Usually our visit to this location is one that is very present and friendly. But today maybe our guest servers were a little tired?. The food was good, and even though they were not our guest servers, Arron and Ciro were very welcoming and pleasant.  Dont worry we will return.</Text>

<Review>This ihop sucks now. They don't have the same menu as some other ihops I've been to so extremely limited options. My waitress didn't know what a poached egg was. When I asked for a second side of ranch she told me they had run out.... How do u run out of ranch 5 minutes after I just got some.</Review>< pics>

DAMN GINA !!  Mcdonalds  across the street is looking good  right now... Group of 13 waitresses should have written our orders down that would have helped along with hot food. The same math to calculate the bill should be use to serve the food timely presentable hot and thoroughly cooked. Balloon man was awesome.< /Review>

<text>Waited to be seated waitress told us that she would be whit us for a minute, didn't come back till a different one finally got us a table, gave us the menu walked away whit out even asking what we wanted to drink. We were ready to order waitress never came back. Instead she keep on passing until she finally took us into consideration and said she would be whit us. Well she passed again whit out even stopping and taking out order after 15 minutes there we didn't get drinks served to us. Just threw the menu on the table and she just looked at us like if she didn't care at all to see us go.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c69203c59935:0x9ef2cc5f2219b714</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Went on a Tuesday and it was disappointing. The quality and portions of the the meals were poor. The pancakes seemed pre-made. They split in half when cut into. Ordered a dbl deck BLT and it was served without tomatoes. The cook immediately corrected by shoving 1slice in each half of the sandwich.< /Review>

< Review>
I want so badly to give this place 5 stars.  Why does every IHop take so long to bring your food? The waiters were very nice.  The food was delish.
I'd recommend the Spinach Mushroom Swiss Omelette! Yum!
But its frustrating when they take your full drink away and replace it with water, then they don't acknowledge you for the next 10 minutes.< /Review>

Staying near by and wanted to sit on their patio with our small hypoallergenic service dog. Host told us there was no server for the patio so its closed! What is the point in having a patio if we can't use it. And why can't someone just take our order! Needless to say they lost our custom.<//Text>

The Patty Melt fell far short of my expectations. But overall, the meal was good. IHOP has become quite expensive, to me at least. Next time, I'm just going to order what's cheapest .< /Text>

I highly reccomend this place for Uber drivers at night. It is open 24 hours and great service and food. Has a good restroom and it's right by the cheapest gas in downtown and by the stadium. Great parking lot with night guard too.< /Review>

The waiter was terrible never came over after serving our food, I had to get up and refill my own drink. Food and presentation was subpar other customers had a similar complaint. The sad part is I'm person to always leave a tip but not today.<//Text>

It's rare that the service is bad, but now and then it happens.  The food is good and prices are very reasonable.  Try the turkey dinner, very tasty.  Seniors get a free dinner entree on Wednesdays--buy one, get one free.  Denny's is okay but iHop is at least as good as Denny's and often better.</text>

< Review>
Waited 12 minutes, no one didn't take our drink order or ask if we were ready to order our food. We were sat in a window booth where it was hot and the seats and table were burning hot. People who came in after us were already getting served. When we went to complain all the management told us was that they didn't know people were sat down eventhough someone sat us.<//Review>

<review>This location is terrible, I feel like this is my third bad experience here, they sat us down, ask what we wanted to drink and we told them we were ready to order and he said hes only taking drink orders because his "cook is stuck at the moment" and he left and said that his manager was coming to help take our order, then.... drank my first cup of coffee waited 20 min looked around then said ok theres another 2 couples waiting to get their orders taken then waited just a bit more, at this moment I thought this place should be called IHope they take my order!!! Anyway we got up went to go pay our drinks and they didnt know where we were sitting no clue, and the whole crew of waiters just standing around doing nothing looking clueless, they told us to just go and I didnt even complain to them they knew they were sucking lol anyways never again.R.I.P ihop on fig. Should of been a ihob🤣🤣</review>< rating>

This is the greatest IHOP in the world, don't laugh I'm serious. Always fast, friendly, and they even let you call in an order for pick up, although the fact they have a huge outdoor patio with an amazing 100 year old tree makes us eat there quite a lot. If it had a fancy hipster name like "Super Galactic Food Station" meals would be like 30 bucks a plate, but they're only like 10. I'm hungry now gonna get a egg ham and cheese melt. ***Updating my review because I just got home from picking up my order and don't have any Tabasco sauce, not their fault I didn't ask for Tabasco sauce just really wish I had Tabasco sauce. Man I love this IHOP so much.*****Final Final update this egg ham cheese melt is incredible even without Tabasco sauce!

Yo, just came back for some fried chicken and my girlfriend texted me like,"where are you!?? You go to Black Bar to talk to chicks!!!???" And I was like , "Relax girl, IHOP4EVeRrrr"< /text>

I like coming here after a night out. Lots of characters show up after 1am. Last time I went my waitress seemed to be under the influence of something, not that I care because she still did her job correctly....just found it interesting and amusing.<//Review>

Worst ihop i have ever been service is so horrible waitress seems like they don't know what they are doing, they send us to the patio for our table and our table wasn't even ready, food take so long to be ready. i ask for a fork and they send it to the next table i will never come back, food isn't bad it's just the service.< /Review>

<Text>They sat me down behind a divider and no one could see me. I waited close to 20 min waiting for someone to come introduce themselves and get me possibly a drink to start. Nope they were all too busy talking and having a mini meeting at the cash register at the entrance to even notice anything. I got up walked towards the exit and shouted next time you sit someone make sure you can see them. I waited 20 minutes for no one to notice me. Horrible never returning. Never giving iHop business ever again. I will stand outside and discourage patrons if I ever get the chance.</Text>< Date>

Customer service was okay.(friendly)

Cons: Fork, knife still had food from other customers service.( Dishes not washed good)
Cups had hair on it.
Food was cold. (undercooked)

Food is not what ihop used to be, now portions are smaller taste is mediocre and expensive, this restaurant lives out of past years reputation and lazy people. I went there Sunday morning wait was not long, place was busy, cooks were shouting ambiance was very loud, waiter just took the order and never bother to attend table I even had to wait for the bill. I'm going to support local independent owned business and find a Better place to get breakfast on weekends.</Review>

And it doesn't even deserve 1 star because after 25 mins waiting for a table, they kept seating other people after us. Came to celebrate and we left uncelebrated.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Something that I loved was the service of the waiter who attended us, such a friendly helpful person who never touched us, patient, very accommodating, very smiling and never lost his cool, (because we are really difficult) this man really LOVES HIS JOB, We should be more like that, because it is so nice to be served like this and the food is enjoyed more, so the food was very good, although the place a bit dirty, maybe it lacks staff, but the service made up for it all !! !

(Original)
Algo que me encantó fue el servicio del mesero que nos atendió, una persona tan amable servicial cual nunca nos avía tocado, paciente, muy complaciente, muy sonriente y nunca perdió la calma, (porque somos realmente difíciles) este hombre realmente AMA SU TRABAJO, deberíamos de ser más así, porque es tan agradable ser atendidos así y se disfruta más la comida, así que la comida fue muy buena, aunque un poco sucio el lugar, tal vez le haga falta personal, pero el servicio lo compensó todo!!!< /text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) On vacation in Los Angeles we wanted to try a restaurant for breakfast. In the end, we ended up with breakfasts and dinners at night.
First of all, a most respectful and warm welcome.
A service at the top and rather fast even at busy times.
The breakfasts are super good and the burgers too.
A very good typical American restaurant if you are visiting or staying here.

While on holiday in Los Angeles we wanted to try a restaurant for breakfast. Finaly, we ended up with dinners in the evening.
First of all, a most respectful and warm welcome.
A top notch and a bit of fast service even at peak times.
Breakfasts are great and so are burgers.
A very good typical American restaurant if you are passing through or staying here.

En vacance à Los Angeles on a voulut essayer un restaurant pour les petits-déjeuners. Au final, on a fini sur des petits-déjeuners et des dinners le soir.
Tout d'abord, un accueil des plus respecteux et des plus chaleureux.
Un service au top et plutôt rapide même aux heures d'affluence.
Les petits-déjeuners sont super bons et les burgers aussi.
Un très bon restaurant typique américain si vous êtes de passage ou en séjour ici.
