<Review>The barbers here at this barber shop is waaaayyyyy over priced! One of the barbers gone try to charge my 14 year old son $35.00 for a simple hair cut mind you he doesn’t have any facial hair! I do not recommend these rip offs my son paid $25.00 before which was still a rip or and the work wasn’t even worth the $25.00 I do not recommend this hole in the wall.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Based on reviews, I took my kids here. Right when we walked in we were greeted and asked what we were looking for. There were plenty of barber chairs, about 10, and we got right in. This was the day before school started and I was glad to get in so quickly. Two boys got $20 fades w/line-up. Older son got a little longer top style that was also $20. After being there for a minute I noticed the shampoo station and inquired about my daughter also getting her hair done. Miss Cherry was available and willing, she even went to the store and got the EZBraid hair. For cornrows with added hair, a few bangs and two rows at the back of the neck, $80. She added the decorations for free. There were bathrooms and parking available. My boys had to sit while their sister had her hair done, but everyone was very nice and understanding.
Fast forward a few days, my daughter has small red bumps on her scalp and has scratched it raw in a few areas. So I called and was told to bring her in and Miss Cherry would look at it. She put some aloe gel and some anti-itch scalp oil throughout the scalp and suggested to continue doing so. The style lasted three weeks. So I am happy.</Review>

<review>Shop's make me nervous and l love my natural cures curly hair. BUT this place has very friendly stylist who are not afraid to work on your hair regardless of race. The price is high but worth every penny knowing the person doing your hair is confident but also respectful. I'm Nigerian and was raised to always respect anyone doing your hair or serving you food. But I'm also 100% California knows whAt she wants 24/7 step by step girl so I don't put up with ok hair. This lady did a good job, but next time I'll schedule an appointment with my stylist who was of course too booked to take me in when I just walked in. But Charm's Mane did a good job so I'm fine with my french bread.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp7siZsez4bsrZzlL39Y-OLlRPE0e-XqmF8UeK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW0soahxfR4qWsYpwMY65ZFAF6OvaBr8WOxKFQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUi3Korexxpnh6fpSzF3pwhItyMA69zuHuKoAD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x809ac594c07f84b9:0xd51cccd09eb3e743< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Been getting my hair cut here since I was 8. Everyone is very personable and they really give you a family feel. In addition they actually cut hair, they don't just spray on your hairline and keep it pushing like some other $30+ shops. If your looking for a solid and consistent baber you found it here.<//review>

Best  Black owned hair shop in Sacramento. Owned by Tracy and Rob Brown . Tracy has been my stylist for years. Cater to  Both men and women, hairstylist and barber in the same building. I will not give a referral to a business if  its mediocre. I refer  this business to friends and new people to the  city. All the time. Check them out.</Text>

They are professional clean, courteous, and from my experience, charge the same if not less then the rest. Also they have several television screens, for entertainment, and they don't all have to watch the same program. Just let them know if you want to watch something else, and if its okay with everyone in your area it gets changed. It good for all and even children with a present parent.<//review>< pics>

<text>Worst family customer service EVER!!

The daughter Robin Simone was very unprofessional.

To name just a couple of issues requested dark brown I received black was left sitting for an extended amount of time, dye was left on my hair near my ears and on my forehead.

Had to go to somewhere else to get the dye removed and pay additional fees.

While under the hair dryer and she went and talked about me among the clients and other stylists in additon to her mother as well.

This is why when you're a professional maintain professionalism at all times.

The mother took it a step further and came to take a look at me while I was sitting under the dryer!

Was very uncomfortable at that point so I asked to speak with her and she walked away and never returned.

I paid and left right away with my hair looking a mess.<//text><Rate>1<//Rate><date>1571346491909</date>< user_id>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Dont know about a hair salon and what it has to offer im a guy. You can get a great haircut at a lot of different places. This involves the customer service which is horrible. My children had a appointment we weren't walk ins. We came in and no one asked if we had a appointment and we sat for 45 mins. Not much personality in the barbershop, hair salon. Not a big fan of the hair salon, barbershop mix. The women or in the corner while the barbers take up the space. Plus there is a barber in the review section reviewing his own shop.</text></record>

<Date>1560145904743<//Date><Rating>4<//Rating><text>Super cute and yummy drinks! Even got a little corgi butt on my milk tea! I think the only thing that made me give this place 4 stars is that there's not really anywhere to sit. The shop is really tiny and only had a few bar stools. You can't face your friends unless you sit sideways. There's a little wall of Polaroids of people and their dogs. The heart shaped one is a collage of photos with corgis in them.

I got the earl grey cheesecake milk tea and my friend got the matcha latte. Both were really good. I asked for mine half sweet and it was still pretty sweet. Probably could've gone down a little bit more.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrbAse8kWX8yPfBkzqmfGvnYiOMJmmSzaGGfE1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjlC8Qh0ZKDuVuBh_anQjlODZuZ8L7zPo_MbBp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808581db0e57b735:0xb642e221cdd6954c< /gmap_id></record>

Recommend sea salt cream top for all of the tea drink in here. The cream is very rich and matches very well with tea base.<//Review>

<review>Good quality milk tea. Strong tea taste (LOVE). Not great space to just hang out with friends and difficult to find parking around. Be prepared for a wait in the late evening. We went a little after lunch on Friday and it wasn't busy but got busy after we ordered. Would definitely be back if I was in the area!</review>< name>

< Review>
Came here with a group of coworkers after eating in Chinatown. I got the earl grey milk tea 70% sweet regular size (17oz). I didn't really like my drink because it tasted really watered down and I couldn't really taste the tea flavor but all my coworkers liked their drinks so maybe it's just a preference. Very cute logo with the regular cup size even shaped similar to a stubby/chubby little corgi butt (I'm sure that was intentional). They have a cute interior as well but it's a pretty small shop located across from the park near Chinatown. At the end of the day, the drink is most important to me and this just didn't cut it.

Workers were very nice, also nice enough to take a group picture for us but I don't see myself purposely coming back here (prices are pretty high for mediocre drinks) unless my friends or coworkers wanted to come here. In which case, I would give it another chance and try the jasmine milk tea or the roasted oolong tea. For now, I will pass on coming back.< /Review>

Very limited seating in store. Got an oolong milk tea and strawberry matcha (since I'm obsessed with the boba guys one). The strawberry matcha  was more jam-y than the one at boba guys and didn't mix as well. Oolong was pretty strong in tea flavor which I enjoyed!< /text>

“Boba-butt, boba-boba, boba-butt...” The name of the store certainly has a ring to it or was that a song by Major Lazer from 2013? It caught our attention anyway, as we were walking back towards our hotel. The bubble tea was enjoyable and it was refreshing to the taste. The service was quick and friendly and there was a huge selection to choose from.</review>

<Text>Very cute logo, but the bubble tea is just okay... Very mediocre. I got the passion fruit green tea with bubble and aloe gel. The bubbles were a little over cooked and didn't have the right chew. Overall an acceptable bubble tea, but nothing to make a special trip for.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I feel like this place is riding the IG wave. I got a large cream cheese jasmine tea. What I got was 90% tea and 10% cream topping. Too disproportionate in my opinion. The tea was also too bitter.< /Review>< username>

Local tip: if you bring your dog in, your drink gets an upgraded size for free, or you get free toppings.< /review>

<review>First off, this place is very IG worthy. I got the strawberry matcha latte and I personally thought it was okay. The syrup they use is way too sweet for my taste, I prefer boba guys’ version. I do; however, like their recyclable straws and have non-dairy milk options.< /review><Date>1565131789034< /Date><Response>None</Response><username>Heather Kim<//username>< gmap_id>

Do not take your boots here to replace soles. Cheap quality and sloppy work. My boots are heavier than the soles so it feels weird walking in them plus they look super cheap and flaws all around the soles. You can see the glue all around the boots. A waste of money. Very disappointed. They cleaned the boots well but I can’t wear these so I’ll have to toss them.<//Text>

Literally the worst customer experience I’ve ever had, every single time I’ve had to deal with this business. I’ve kept at it because the selection is good, but the prices aren’t cheap if you value your time or sanity. After 5 attempts over the course of a year, I am switching suppliers and hope to never encounter these rude entitled jerks ever again.< /Review>

I just shopped here to get some vinyl and had a really great experience.  The service was great
and the prices were very competitive.  I walked through the warehouse and found it to be very organized and well stocked. The owner also walked by and helped with some questions I had.  Would definitely recommend visiting this store.< /Text>

BEWARE!! Incompetent and unknowledgeable  staff, bad customer service and unfair policies. Huge waste of time. Also when a customer spends $500 on a product the least you can do is wrap it in paper or cardboard so it’s not immediately damaged< /Review>

This place has just about EVERYTHING you'd need. Trouble is, there's such terrible service.

I stopped by to look at plastic rods. They are way high up so you can't feel them or handle them to test weight or flexibility in your hand. You have to guess. There are two buildings separated by an open lot where random trucks and forklifts come n go.

In the East building I waited and waited for someone to assist. While I waited, there was an employee screaming at someone (the owner??) about something. She was screaming. That's not hyperbole. Screaming. I was shocked. A shy man approached me and was nice and said I could look at rods in the West building. So I did.

There appeared to be 4-5 guys who looked like employees standing around. I asked for help and one grunted with his arm outstretched pointing to a desk in the next room. I took the cue and looked for help "over there". Being my first time, I must have asked too many questions because the guy working the counter was less than happy. No eye contact, curt one word responses. I heard NO a few times.

So I bought what I thought i needed: 3 rods.  I didn't know they wouldn't work for me until AFTER I paid and i waited another 10 minutes for a worker to bring them down from a scissor lift.

When i realized it I asked for a switch  or exchange. The man said no. I asked for a refund. The man said no. So i took the rods to the car and realized there is a restocking fee with returns.

So I went back and was denied service.

I really wish this experience was for a gag show or some comedic relief, but I'm still waiting for the punch line.

I can't urge you to stay away enough unless you know that you know that you know what you're getting is going to be 100000% perfect for your needs and you honestly don't care about the negative vibes.

Good luck out there!</text>

BEFORE YOU READ THIS DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE!!!
December 29 I arrived at 4:30 pm, Roberto took my measurements and I told him what I wanted to order, I started checking the scrap aisle thinking my order was getting cut but no, I came back 15 minutes later and he said that the cutter had gone home and for me to go back the next day which I told him no, that I was there and needed my order cut, him and some other guy that claimed to be a manager tried to intimidate me so I got a refund. After the bad experience I went back today December 30 and placed my other, I asked for a manager or owner to talk to, Roberto from the guy before came up to me all rude and saying “what do you want?” “Complain about what” I asked the other manager Jazmine to let me talk to the owner, when he finally came out he backed up Roberto saying he’s been with the company for many years and that his employees “the cutters” can leave at anytime they want since business is slow, with that answer I guess the owner should close the shop so he doesn’t have to deal with customers!<//Review>

When I called the manager he said "Im not going to make enough money on your order so I wont deliver"... even though they had delivered to me in the past. They only look out for themselves even if it means breaking promises to customers. The positive reviews on here are from friends/family or paid.</Text>< pics>

<text>I wish I had read these reviews before doing business with them. The negative customer reviews about rudeness to customers and aggressive behavior from staff is true and happened every time I went into the shop and every time I called. And now the polygal that I bought just a few months ago has an unsightly water stain, despite following Gavrieli's installation instructions to the tee and hiring a contractor to do the job. I called today and got the same rude behavior when I asked what could be done. Very disappointing. You will not have a good experience.< /text><user>109138179178376173428<//user><Rate>1<//Rate><date>1582926595036< /date><name>Margaret Hussey< /name>< gmap_id>

<text>I'm seriously surprised they're still in business. After a couple of years of not buying from them, I decided to give it another try. NOPE! They still have horrible service, after all these years. You don't get acknowledged, and when they do....they act like they're doing YOU a favor. It's a very, "what do you want" type of attitude, instead of the more welcoming and politely, "how can I help you", etc. They've also hung up on me over the phone in the past. I would avoid this place if I were you. I'd rather drive that extra mile or pay extra elsewhere.</text>< pictures>

I have been a customer of Gavrieli for over 20 years. Our company has had an account for the past 7 years. Customer service is mixed bag, either very helpful, or the complete opposite. They have several of their own knock-off versions of various substrates, most of them lesser quality with a slight decrease in price. They used to have an edge on the competition with pricing, but that is no longer the case. The warehouse guys have absolutely no concern for the products they are giving you, every order must be thoroughly inspected. We have paid dearly for not inspecting every single sheet. One of the worst experiences we had was receiving a piece of 3/8” material that had clear film on one side. Because the protective layer was clear, we did not notice it was missing until it was back at our shop. When we called to see what could be done about the $400+ sheet I now needed to replace, the owner told me there was no way the warehouse would give us something like that. I politely asked him to take a look at our account to verify that over the previous years we have done well over $250,000 in business with them. He told me that was of no concern and I could take my business elsewhere. After this experience I have made every effort to seek out new vendors and although they may be further away, the service and quality of products is better in every regard no matter where we go.  There is such high turnover at the sales counter that product knowledge is minimal at best. If you have to use Gavrieli, it really should be a last resort. Other vendors I would highly recommend

Some neat stuff if you want plastic. Expensive cuts at $8 a cut. Not so great/quick service. Called asking for something and was told it was there. Got there and then told it wasn’t, found out it was then has to look around for someone to fill the order. Very large inventory. Plastic itself isn’t overpriced, but cuts will get you.<//review>

I have used Gavrieli products for my business needs over the last few years on a multiple of projects, and the products are easy to use, last a long time, and the prices are very comparable to others. I do have a few other vendor resources as well, however Gavrieli’ s is cheaper. Customer service is not so much of a concern to me, my primary concern is quality and pricing. This isn’t personal, its business. Keep up the supply and low pricing, and I will continue business.< /review><Response>{'time': 1547841886790, 'text': 'Thanks a lot!

I see all the bad reviews, and yes there are a few employees there that might not be super friendly, but the sheer magnitude at how cool the store is, and how unique it is warrants a 5 stars for me.  There is very few cities around the US that offer the selection of cool supplies like they offer, and the great prices also warrant higher star rankings.  There is one employee that always says hello to me, always ready to take me order, and, works with me on the price, so I am surprised at how bad their reviews are.  Plus one time I found an old piece of mirrored plexiglas that was this really cool color, it ended up be a little out dated, even though I chopped it up into a bunch of pieces, they still gave me a full refund.  Really, the place is not as bad as people are trying to make it out to be.<//Text>

I give them 1 stars and explain why:
1 stars just for having such a variety of products in very convenient location for me.
just called them first time like 15 minutes ago, person answered phone. as soon I told him I have couple Q's, he told me he is accounting and has to transfer me to sells department LOL
hold, person responds and it's same guy: oh, you still on hold,smile, one second,puts me back on hold.

Well, all I can tell the owner of this company, after reading all this reviews: You need a good manager!!!

P.S. if you really decide to have one, I'm available and even willing to help you (I'm using plastic in my work, so it will be good for me as well to get more knowledge)<//Review>

Lots of sign-making materials available here.  This seems to be a resource place, more for the professional sign-builder tradesman.  It's not so much for the novice, do-it-yourself guy (though, if you can do it and you approach the sales counter knowing what you need, they can sure tell you if it's available through them.
Frequently a short wait in line at the counter, but once it's your turn to step up to the couner, they focus on your needs, to answer all your questions & see that you get what you want.</Text>

I have never left a review for any business, in my life, but this experience  has inspired me to.
I came in yesterday and pulled a sheet of acrylic from the "Scrap-Bin" and brought it to the counter.  I was told, it would be $45 for the sheet plus $5 per cut.  I only needed a 3/4 inch strip, so $50 was a lot, especially since most of the sheet would end up back in the scrap bin, to be sold again.  I ran the price by my customer and they agreed to pay the $50.  I returned today to purchase the sheet and the same guy now told me that the price was now $75!  I asked to speak to the owner and he wouldn't budge.
Bad customer service.  Easily, one of the worst experiences I've ever had as a customer.  I wish it was possible to leave zero stars!</Review>

The service of the counter persons is bad they have attitude all the time and good luck trying to exchange or return something. I will say the service off the warehouse people is great that's the rezon there getting 2 stars. The prices well I thought they had the best but you should try polymiter chapes in Burbank they have better prices or simply eplastics I bought 10 rods of .75" acrylic from gabriely for 20.56 each . Then a friend toll me of the eplastics and what a difference 11.25 per rod even paying the 20 dollars on shipping is great better price . That is my point off view</text>

This place SUCKS.  It used to be so good, but not anymore...

I've been a customer off an on for over 20 years.  But recently, (and as the overwhelmingly negative yelp reviews have shown), they've gone completely downhill and don't appear to care.

If you want lousy service, long wait times, a staff that could care less, coupled with high prices, and bad attitudes, then by all means, Gavriele Plastics is the place for you.

The customer service is ATROCIOUS.  Try to voice a complaint, and instead of apologizing or working to fix the issue, the idiots working there would rather ARGUE with you.

They have NO CONCEPT of BASIC customer service, they treat the customers like crap, and the problem is RAMPANT.  Not one, but SEVERAL staff members they day I was there were ATROCIOUS.

Never setting foot in that place again, but I suspect, with their attitudes, they won't be around much longer.

You've been warned!<//Text>

I read all the bad reviews, and non sense, and yes, I will say the business etiquette of the associates are not of the kindness you would hope for- however, when it comes to volume, and quality- I have yet to find a competitor to provide cheaper for my business needs while maintaining decent quality.  When I save money, my clients save money. This is the bottom line. With so much competition, I have to keep my prices low, or my clients will go elsewhere. by saving money on materials, i pass the savings onto my clients. For my, Gavrieli is my direct source for 12" Vinyl 50 yard rolls.</Review>

really really bad service, bad customer service and unprofessional company. I called and asked 3 times If they have 4x10 pvc, they said yes we have it and we will deliver it tomorrow. around 12 I got a call form one of their customer service people saying we do not have that in stock. This is not the first problem, a few weeks later I called and ordered 2 5x10 acrylic sheets, delivery guy came and asked if we could help him out, I was not in the office and there my designers were there, they are all ladies and couldn't help the guy, without saying anything the guy leaves the place. I called the owner to see what is going on, guess what he said? He said my delivery guy is old and have back pain If he doesn't want to do the job he won't do it and I can not force him or say anything to him. This is it. I had to look for 3 days to see who has the same products so I can order, My customer got mad, couldn't deliver the job on time, Had to give them discount and rush the order. REALLY REALLY MESSED UP COMPANY TO WORK WITH.< /Review>

(+) A large corner (20ft rack space) of 'scrap' most of which is scratched or broken on the corners, (-) so a lot of cleanup labor involved, and the plastic is so jammed in there it's nearly impossible to explore but 25% of it.
Basically, if you want it clean, you must buy the whole sheet.
(+) Luis is A nice guy, who will treat you well, as manager material. But the old-timer cranky guy, who argue over every last nickel and dime, is a PITA. You'll meet him as all estimate decisions go through his tyrannical hands. (+\-)The sales ladies are fairly nice, sometimes sweet, but completely clueless as to what they have in back, as they can only look in the book to see what is scratched out or still available , and sometimes appear to not give a much of a damn about your service, Snapping their gum in mock boredom.
(+) The The other shop employees are  coy, sycophants, and fairly cheerful and empathetic, as they are also existing under the tyrannical  rule of grand Poohbah.
(-) Don't try to measure  that 7/16 thick foam core as  3/8, but bow before the Poohbah and admit you're a nominal idiot, trying to steal his Grand ½" thick material for ⅜ price.
(-) YOU will WAIT. Worm. Because we are ALWAYS backlogged with stupid right angle cuts, for which we charge $5-100 dollars for, because we suck at cutting and need the money. So just go to lunch, and come back to receive, inspect and reject your crappy cut with the chipped out quarters only to have us  do it over again.

I made an order for delivery, and gave them the number of a specific card to use, instead they used a card they had on file,  I didn't have enough on that card, so I was left with an overdraft fee of $40. They didn't reimburse me for their mistake, so I'm leaving this review.</Text>

They took four hours to get my order for cut acrylic down, got it wrong, charged me $40 more than advertised on their website (plus cutting fees), couldn't guide me through picking up my order (kept telling me to go different places), and charged me before sending me an invoice, when I clearly stated not to do that. No customer service, dishonest, and generally frustrating.</Review>

<Date>1459824335498< /Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>Dishonest, rude, unprofessional, just some of the many words I would use to describe Gavrieli Plastics, metal and ripoffs. I've given this place plenty of business over the years, and I'm so happy to finally be taking my business ANYWHERE ELSE . Never going here again, telling every art director, contractor, and craftsperson I know to boycott this place until they are forced to close and their crooked owner can go back to wherever he came from.

I don't need to go into the details of what exactly they did, but it involved 3 levels of incompetence and absolutely no accountability. They were unable to make a simple cut correctly, the girl on the phone misquoted me by a whopping $300, and then they didn't ask to confirm anything before charging the credit card that was whatever one they had on file from who knows how long ago. Never again gavrieli, never again.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Worst.. Never go back.. They loaded my drivers truck and sent damaged product.  Called the  immediately called and spoke to the owner.
He refused to take back damaged product,
I went to POLYMERSHAPES in Burbank to replace.. And they were 40.00
dollars less a sheet. for the exact same item.< /Text>

My company always orders from here and we always receive TERRIBLE customer service and the owner is so rude and unprofessional. But I do have to say Juan is a really good customer rep and was very helpful when I needed assistance other than that I would probably rate them one star.</Review>

This place has a big variety of plexis 1/4 has limited colors. Customer service is bad .I was quoted 1amount once I got out there the price had gone up. Took me about an hour to set up a business account there was no one in front of me . They took over an hour to give me my order after I had already left the plexis sticking out I only got 16 sheets 8 feet. Heard couple other people asking for refounds that was my experience.<//text>

<review>Terrible service take your money elsewhere. They charge 8$ to make 1 cut lol competitors charge 1$ very rude as well.

2 years later decided to give them one more shot same rude service possibly even worse I would rather drive 45 minutes away then give them $1 of service stay away! They try to charge me more for scraps than a brand new sheet<//review>< name>

<review>STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
Worst customer service I've received from a supplier. I spoke to their sales person, Alex, for at least 20 minutes trying to order 3 items. He didn't know or understand aluminum thicknesses, so he kept putting me on hold while he "checked". Almost like he didn't know any of the items they sell. I had some downtime, so I didn't try to pressure him because I assumed he might be new at this job. I also ordered painted 4'x8' MDF, cut into (4) 12" x 8ft panels. Now, I'm having to explain the cut math. He tells me that each cut is $5(but I end up getting charged $10 on the invoice), so I tell him that he needs to charge me for 3 cuts to yield the 4 panels I need. I've ordered materials from them before, and their customer service has always been mediocre, so I continued the order because I needed the MDF. The delay to this simple order, was to due  in part to Alex writing everything down. But I remained patient because I really thought it might be his first day.
My order is scheduled for delivery the next day, but It doesn't come until the following day. The worst part is that the painted MDF that I ordered came unfinished and cut into (3) 12"x8ft, (1) 9.5"x8ft, (1) 3"x8ft. Aside from that some of the panels are bashed in around the edges and completely unusable.
I call them first thing the next day. We go  back and fourth on the phone because apparently only Alex can help me fix the order because only he and I know what was discussed. But, he's busy so I'm told he'll call me back. Its late afternoon, and I still haven' received a call.  I call them and I'm told that Alex is out to lunch and won't be back until 4pm.
I ask to be transferred to the owner after I'm told that no one can adjust or correct the invoice, except for him. So, why did I need to talk to Alex???
After talking to the owner, its abundantly obvious that the terrible customer service stems from the top. This guy clearly has no concept of what it means to treat your customers with respect. He tells me that he can't help me because the material has already been cut.I told him I agreed with that, but that unfinished MDF wasn't what I ordered. I asked him to refer to the invoice that indicated the MDF to be painted. He said, "That's what you told the guy to write on the invoice. If you're a sign-maker you should know how the material come." I then told him that it wasn't cut correctly either. Again he says, " I can't help you buddy. The transaction has already batched."
I'm not sure how this company remains in business with this kind of order resolution.<//review><GmapID>0x80c294296d9521ad:0xadb534a86115ebb8< /GmapID></record>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Absolutely the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with. Called for a product and was told that it was in stock and was quoted a price. Drive down to their location and am told that the size product I specifically asked for was not something they had. Annoying, but the alternate size was something I could use so I was OK with going forward with that. After bouncing between 2 different offices and generally being ignored one gentleman calls for my order to be pulled. However the price is nearly $30 higher than I was quoted and no one can explain why the price went up except to say that's what it is. Suffice to say I will never be back and wouldn't send my worst enemy to buy anything from these idiots.<//Text>< Pics>

I switched carriers from Boost to Metro due to major connection issues that I had with Boost. Due to Boost complications, it messed up my phone numbers connection with ports and towers. Brianna that works at this location was extremely helpful after hitting so multiple forms of red tap internally and with corporate. Despite all complications, Brianna was able to assist me with a great deal of professionalism, patience and compassion. SHOUT OUT TO BRIANNA FOR THE SUPPORT!<//text>

<text>Just horrible customer service. Vanessa is just terrible at her job. Sarah is very unprofessional as well. I don’t have time to write a long review about my horrible experience, these two girls are literally the worst.. Train your employees Metro they clearly don’t care & it’s a reflection on your store. Imagine finding out you qualify for an upgrade at the end of an transaction because the employee was too dumb to mention it.<//text>< time>

Sarah sold me a phone yesterday. Sarah had excellent customer service. I came back today and Steven was able to get my gmail back and contacts. By far the best metro store I've been to. I highly recommend you guys come to this metro store and ask for Sarah or Steven. You'll leave the store happy.< /Text>

The customer service here is questionable at best the employees aren't really employees there more like swat me dealers. They get paid by commission to close a deal so if you're not there to shop believe me they want nothing to do with you. The parking lots a bit dangerous but I'm sure if you know in our local you know this by now do your shopping early morning and you'll probably walk out safely.< /Review>

This spot is my favored. I eat in plenty of restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The stuff is very attentive and the cuisine they place on your table is so flavorful. I never miss an opportunity to have a decent meal in this restaurant. Highly recommended.<//review>

< Review>
Nice traditional Chinese Restaurant housed in what looks to be a former Pizza Hut. Food was very good and so was the service. I was there for lunch with some friends and everyone enjoyed their food. I can't say anything bad. I wish I lived closer and I'll definitely be back!< /Review>

Very hospital staff. Tasty side dishes but not exquisite.Great quality meat and excellent Kimchi Stew! Plenty of good home style Korean food. Plus, a much better parking situation than the myriad of Korean restaurants on Convoy Street in Kearney Mesa<//review>

Best in San Diego. Prices are very comparable but the amount of meat is the most I have seen. Customer service was great. Bring your appetite if you come.< /Review>

<time>1590604830212</time><review>Good food. Not extraordinary but good. Biggest complaint is priced my order out on their website including tax and still got charged $10 more than expected. Never got an itemized receipt so I don't know if the employee pocketed the extra money or if there was an upcharge because of the beef shortage.< /review>< Pics>

The Korean food is authentic. Both those who like original Korean food will love it as well as those who don't like spicy. They have a great choice. Ask for halmoni (grandmother) to advise you on your choice of meals</Text>

Nice little spot off of the freeway. There's parking so that's already a bonus.

The restaurant itself isn't that large. I didn't really explore it, but it's a decent size. We initially had a really large group, but half of us ended up coming in later.

The staff is friendly and it feels like a family run business. We ordered a special order and it was huge. There were 14 of us and the food was plentiful.

I originally wasn't set on eating kbbq. I was craving some naengmyeon, and I was dead set on ordering that. Glad I did though. It was so good!! The bowl was huge and the price was just right.

I had some kbbq and it was pretty good. Nice flavors and sliced perfectly. Well worth the money.

I almost got burned by the flames, and that was no bueno, but no fault of the restaurant. I do wish their tongs were a little bit longer, though.< /review>

Walked in the front door, a lady in the back waved us back (seriously?) and pointed at a seat and walked away without saying anything... felt very un-welcoming. She brought us waters and menus. The menu was poorly done and difficult to read. Seemed like everything was 30 or 40 dollars for a single item. I don't want a mountain of food, just make some reasonably priced individual dinner plates! We walked out after a couple minutes because it felt waaaaay too awkward in there!<//Text>

Nice place attended by locals. Good korean food, but the prices are expensive for the size and quality of dishes. The menu has a variety of options.</text>

<Text>This is not the best Chinese place in town. I ordered shrimp and vegetables stir fry. I got soup. There was so much sauce! I told staff I was eating in house yet I still got my food in styrofoam container and plastic fork. The veggies and shrimp were good, after fishing them out of the sauce. I wouldn't say it tasted like Chinese stir fry, more like veggies and shrimp in a chicken broth sauce. I won't be back. Super disappointed because I've heard good things about the place</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs94FVokPOPpn3qsxObhn86RzdM6SaORlQn0Un=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-j9I0DLFlf454wzM3pHT-Sb0jL-_Txpb41_xs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<review>NEVER OPEN ON WEEKENDS!!!... Tried to call last Sunday (7-14-19) and no response. Tried to call in a order today (7-20-19) again no response. Took a trip to China Cafe and looked through the window. There was a guy in there, but the sign on the door said they were closed for the day. Standing outside the Cafe, I then placed another call to China Cafe and the phone just kept on ringing... What they had done was to pull the plug on the phone.
BAD BUSINESS!!! Will never consider China Cafe AGAIN!!!!!!!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Was really disappointed with the menu options and food quality. Used to patronize the golden state location. Since it is no longer there we tried this location. We will find a new restaurant</text>

<text>Terrible! We ordered the family meal and everything was cold and stale. The food was soggy and tasted like it had freezer burn. We were upcharged for combination rice and received 3 shrimp in the whole container and a couple pieces of chicken. I literally could not finish my food and had to spit it out. Don’t waste your money here!</text>< Rate>

Messed up on my order meat was all rubbery in the sweet and sour pork the fried rice look like it was drowned in soy sauce no flavor fried prawns were greasy.sweet and sour had no veggies. If I could I would give it a quarter star it would even make it to the half * I recommend nobody go there again.food tasted like it was microwaved< /text>

Felt terribly inauthentic and low quality. Sauce on meat entrees is watery/runny and rice/chow mein is way oversalted. At least the food came out fast.< /Text>

My boyfriend & I came here for take-out. We wanted to try a new Chinese place & overall we weren't satisfied. The chow mein was tasteless, orange chicken mainly consisted of breading, & the sweet & sour contained rubbery parts in each & every piece. First & last time coming here.<//review>

I don't know why the reviews for this restaurant are so high. I took a long time to choose where to eat and your reviews had me order from this place. I don't know if it is because I ordered at the beginning of dinner and was possibly served the leftovers of lunch but the fried rice and the chow mein were  very dry. The egg roll have a bad oder. And that's not the worst. The worst was when I found a booger with a hair still clinged to it on my chow mein. The garlic chicken and the sweet and sour chicken tasted fine. Because those two items tasted ok out of the five, I give it 2 stars. 1 1/2 star would have been more suitable due to that nasty, green, crispy booger on my dry mein.<//text>

< Review>
This is the worst Chinese food that I have ever had. I got the Chow Mein and Orange Chicken and neither satisfied me. The Chow Mein had no flavor what so ever and the Orange Chicken was breaded a way I have never seen before. I will not be going and I definitely will not recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>

New Tel-Hi neighborhood ramen place ... a definite go to for comfort food.  Locals get 10% off, that’s a nice gesture :) Big plus: plenty of seatings in modern setting.<//Text>

<text>This restaurant is the one I always prefer. I eat in many restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The crew is very cordial and the food they place on your table is so appetizing. I would always prefer to have a decent meal here. I recommend this place with pleasure.</text>< Pics>

Amazing food! Ordered spicy miso ramen with crab meat level 3 (not that spicy, for reference I like spicy burning stuff). Crab meat was friend a bit on a saltier side but crispy and delicious. Would definitely recommend this place. Get their Thai iced tea with tapioca...hits the spot on a hot day.<//review>

Absolutely loved it. Delicious foods I'll post some before and after pics. My ten year old and I enjoyed all of our food. We ordered Edamame for appetizer salted. She ordered rice bowl with Teriyaki Salmon I ordered Red Curry Ramen with Veggies and Tofu. Service was good and quick. Clean place with nice seating and TV's. Definitely recommended this place for hearty meals.< /review>

Had the chicken karaage for the appetizer. That was solid with the sauce. Picture is veggie broth Raman with whole chicken leg. Amazing flavor and great value.< /Review>

The chicken karaage was a big let down personally, the batter was very bland and didn't really have the flavor and crunchiness I like.
The tonkatsu broth and noodles and pork were good, but also felt there was an abundance of cabbage instead of more broth.<//review>

Pro-Tip - this is a great place for locals.

This is a great new ramen stop in North Beach. I would give then extra points on how well the broth is done here. Service is convenient and quick.< /Text>

Very average food. I ordered their tofu and vegetables rice bowl to go and it did not have much taste. When I asked for the receipt, the waitress was confused and suddenly decreased the amount by 2 dollars to match the menu saying to me that the price has changed recently. Weird.<//text>

Maybe good enough for a lunch, but I can not recomend this ramen over a fastfood burger or smth. We tried ramen and miso and they are not that different in terms of quality.</Review></record>

I've never seen so many mushrooms in such a small bowl of ramen. Could be good or bad depending on your preference.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The chicken karaage was ok and the ramen was good, but since it's San Francisco, it's no wonder that it's boring! But I want to eat warm food.

(Original)
치킨 가라아게는 괜찮았고 라면도 먹을만 했습니다, 다만 샌프란이니 당연하겠지만 매콤한 맛은 그닥 없어 맛이 심심하다고 느끼실 수 있어요! 그치만 따뜻한 음식 드시고 싶으심 가볍게 한끼 괜찮을 것 같습니다~<//review>< GmapID>

<Text>We love Luiseño park. The play structures are fun. It is always very clean. The bathrooms are clean most of the time (sometimes the light doesn't turn on so they are dark, depending on the time of day).
Parking can get hectic when both fields are being used, but there is plenty of street parking.<//Text><user>117166599472570218004</user><GmapID>0x80dc7a73e30e9ccd:0xe16516915d671e12< /GmapID><date>1617291454542<//date><rating>4<//rating>< username>

Perfect neighborhood park to spend an afternoon! My kids love the big boulders and trees in particular. However, they also meet their sports teams here for extra practice, and for us it’s an alternative to our same old base playgrounds in our neighborhood inside the gate. I personally more than appreciate and think it o fantastic to show them the historical aspects they have maintained and dedicated to the Luiseño peoples. Hidden gems you might miss if you didn’t realize they were there. It’s a dog, bike, walking, sports, party, play, and just all around friendly park! A family was even launching rockets the other day! Big, beautifully maintained fields too for flying kites and playing catch, or getting in some sprints or group training.<//Text>

The cleanest
the friendliest
the "free-from-homeless"
to the max park...!!
++ the cleanest Men's room possible in a park..
No freak loiterers & and I saw only one small piece of graffiti at urinal...
"Trump 2020"
Haha no matter how obscene, it was still minimal graffiti, compared to the gross toilets I've been forced to experience in SanDiego...
Luiseño Park was a half hour pleasure
before the drive back down to San Diego, the junior LA.. ....</review>

<Date>1558802554782< /Date><UserId.>116946502338313574991</UserId.><Review>Seems like a great place for families. I'm single now and felt a bit out of place, and this is on a weekday morning. If you're single and going to a park for quiet time (like to read) or a solo walk/hike, Guajome Park might be a better place. If you're into history, there are things around here, focusing on local Native Americans, which is where the park gets its name (Luiseño band of Mission Indians).</Review><Response>None<//Response>< Name>

During covid, as with most places, there are those following masking guidelines and those who are not. Please be safe, but definitely check the park out its really nice and well maintained. Animals welcome!< /review>

Nice "not so crowded" park. Usually there to walk our dogs. Great playground for the kids. On the small side but plenty of parking, more than adequate restroom facilities. One of the newer parks in the city. Only minus for me is the fast and busy Vandegrift Blvd that borders the NE side of the park.<//text>

Love this park to walk my dog. He now has a pack he likes walking with. The park provides a poop station which is good, even thou someone doesn't follow the rules. It's a great park for community events and activities. Restroom clean, important, even thou there're homeless living in a canyon not far from the park.<//review>

We've gathered there for many years now and it's always been simply enjoyable. The club that organized it is top-notch, they  care about showing everyone a good time not just family and friends, acquaintances as well.</Review>

It's a great little park, the kids (5-12 or so) love the playground. It also has 2 softball fields, and tennis court and plenty of space.< /Text>

I  do love this park. My son and I come here often. It has a nice walking trail surrounding it. It's quiet and the people who attend are friendly. The only downside is people throw birthday parties or gatherings on the weekends leaving a mess. And usually stays a little trashy for a bit since people don't like picking up after themselves and don't watch their misbehaved kids. The park shows more and more wear and needs more upkeep. It's definitely best to go during the week.< /text>

This park has two tennis courts, small playground and ample open space. Sometimes you can find a small local baseball game. Great place to take dog and children. There are bathrooms that are always kept clean.<//text>

Overall nice park, needs some type of gates to keep kids from running into busy vandegrift street.  Also the large rocks are too tempting to play on for kids and dangerous.  No swings. And not much shade which is ok on a cool day.< /text>

<text>My favorite thing about Luiseno Park is the rock piles all along the path and behind the tennis courts. There is a huge variety of rock sizes that you can climb, jump, and hide behind or around.
The playground is great but does not have shade or swings.
Weekends it's just one big party. It always amazes me how bad it gets trashed. I feel bad for the city workers but they do an amazing job at making it beautiful by Monday late morning or afternoon.
It is safe during the day but I am not sure how safe it is a night because I have found tagging of gang symbols on trees, rocks and the playground. You wouldn't know it for the city cleans it up within a week or two.
There are 2 ball fields that can double as soccer fields, a couple picnic tables, 2 or 3 built in coal grills for BBQing, and a loop that is wonderful for biking and walking.< /text>< gmap_id>

<Text>My kids and I love this park. It's a bit off the beaten path so if you don't know about it or frequent the back gate or Mainside gate to Camp Pendleton you may never know it's there. I've been taking my kids here for probably ten years and it's still one of the best and safest parks around. The park is a great size for a neighborhood park with lots or green space for the kids and pets. Two baseball or softball diamonds and a decent playground area for smaller kids up to 10 or so. For adults or your older teens, there is also enclosed tennis court if that's your thing. The only thing that keeps this place from receiving five stars is the inconsistent cleanliness of the bathroom. Some days, they're clean but most days not so much.  Obviously, it's a public park so you can't expect them to be spotless but sometimes they are really dirty and not appropriate for small kids.</Text>< pictures>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>I love the location of this park in proximity to my home. My daughters love to come here also.

The Pros:

Benches to sit outside to watch your kids play.

There are grills if you want to come out and cook, play or just hang out. A plus for birthday party's or summer.

There are two baseball diamonds out where  there are regular games going on. You can also come out to practice.

The Cons:

There is no outside lighting by the picnic area or playground . This is a potential threat to people being out here who aren't with a crowd of people. Even in the area where the bleachers are located it is not lighted. Once the baseball field lights turn off, the park is pitch black!!

The bathrooms look like a scary movie inside. Please BYO soap and sanitizer. They're never stocked with tissue and soap
OR towels to dry your hands. The garbage cans are also outside of the restrooms.

The playground is extremely basic for the amount of space this park has. It is not colorful and there are no swings (at a park) I'd suggest that the city add swings and more activities for the children to do to stay busy. Overall, it's a nice place to come to- it just needs these things to be rectified.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

I live in the area near this park I am fine it to be ok most of the time. There are alot who use it who are very irresponsible leaving their trash and pet droppings everywhere. I find this very sad. People have no respect for anything anymore.< /review>

One if the best in SC. Everything is consistent and consistently delicious. Good flavors and they burritos are big but not "small infant" big so you won't feel too bad eating a whole one.
The staff is super friendly, the hibiscus tea is delicious, and it's pretty quick service!<//text>

After checking the reviews, this place had some good ones, so I checked it out. I ordered 4 tacos and a drink and it came out to and little over $15. It's pretty pricey for what you get but overall the food was pretty good. Not good enough to make me come back, but I had no complaints about it. There are not a ton of good Taquerias in Santa Cruz and this one seemed like the best they had to offer.< /Review>

<review>They have the best enchilada sauce. It has a deep rich smokey flavor. I randomly picked this restaurant while in town on business and I am glad I did. I had the 49er burrito with threaded chicken and it was excellent ad a very reasonable price.</review></record>

I am aware that they were getting ready to close and go home, so I dont take that much offense but I did feel that was quite rude as we were just about to get up and leave. food was good though, wouldn't choose to come to this place again though< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

They have indoor dining now - no outdoor option. The indoor seating doesn’t look very ventilated so I opted for take out both times. Expect some wait! I think I waited 15-20 min both times for my soft tacos. I got tofu, shrimp, fish, pulled pork tacos and loved all of them!< /review>

I have been eating here for years. And they have been lifesaver during the pandemic. It is so easy to swing by and grab a burrito on my way home and avoid the grocery store and avoid delivery services and indulge in some absolutely perfect comfort food. The super burrito with Al pastor is just phenomenal. The number two combination plate is really great!
And their beef soup (carne su jugo) will warm your entire soul!< /Text>

<text>Disappointed with the fish, shrimp, and ceviche choices. Saw a really great review about their fish tacos so we were excited to try it out while visiting. If you're looking for fish/shrimp tacos served with cabbage, pico de gallo, and a cream sauce this isn't the place. It's served with lettuce with heaping scoop of sour cream and runny guac that completely takes over the fish/shrimp and is super messy. The ceviche looked delicious,  but was super limey and not much else. All that acid tore up my tongue. If there's a next time, I'll stick to the burritos and try the al pastor.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<review>Workers improperly wearing masks

I ordered from Taqueria Santa Cruz II today and my al pastor burrito was good, but at least 5 people making food had their noses poking out of their masks. The lady behind the counter also had her mask off (eating I think) when I went back to grab hand sanitizer.< /review>< Pictures>

This is specifically for the Soquel Avenue location. This is one of the best taquerias in town and I'm always amazed that it doesn't make the "best of" lists published. The carna asada has SO much flavor. The tacos are delicious and packed full of meat. I'd highly recommend the carne asada tacos, any variety of the super burritos (but especially the shrimp), the cheese enchiladas, and the tostado. Prices are fairly reasonable, but they've gone up lately. Parking is easy to find and the restaurant itself is huge with plenty of tables. They have a salsa bar with amazing pico de gayo and serve fresh chips with every order. There's a selection of Mexican beverages and desserts. The interior is a little worn, and some menu items are pricier than others. Really love this place.</review>

< Review>
I was not impressed with the food and they Forgot salsa to give us salsa, I'm not quite sure if nowadays you have to ask for that was Mexican but I think that that would have been a given🤔

The whole scene to pick up food during covid-19 was a cluster! They only had two people working at the register and it definitely was not enough! they were very efficient at making the food, but they did not have it an efficient system at Distributing it ...
There were orders piling up
there were people coming in for doordash
there were people coming into put in their orders
there are people coming in to pick up their orders
oh, there was no social distancing Norm that was adhered to.
Which side of me extremely because it's my closest taqueria and I'm newer to this area the neighborhood I was looking forward to hit a homerun and having my new fav... however I will not visit them again until covid-19 is over or new Protocols are initiated because I did not feel comfortable in their entrance space</Review>

Reading these reviews I have come to the following conclusions:
1. This place has excellent tacos. Order them.
2. Get the Al Pastor as your meat choice.
3. Don't order veggie here. (Or at any taqueria really. I mean c'mon.)
4. If you're acting privileged you will be treated accordingly. Smile and be respectful.
5. Be prepared to spend a little more than you'd like, but the Al Pastor tacos will make you glad you did.
6. If all else fails order the soup. The soup is the best thing on the menu.
7. Whatever you order get it to go, make sure to check it over before you leave, like any thinking person would.
Enjoy!<//review>

Food is always good and fast, but I've had some issues with consistency in the preparation. Just have to be specific about how you want it. Still my favorite pastor and taqueria in Santa Cruz</Review>

One of the best casual Mexican food places in the area! Check out their menu and consider expanding your order into items beyond your norm - they serve up good food at reasonable prices top to bottom. Open relatively late for Santa Cruz which surprisingly has very few options open beyond 10 or 11 PM.< /Text>

Wouldn’t recommend this taqueria. They are always messing up on my orders and still get mad because I don’t say bye through the phone. There are better taquerias out in Santa Cruz.that take orders in and out without getting mad and still treat you with a smile.gave the burrito to my dog.<//text>

< Review>
Hated it! First time we went there we liked the food... this second time... the meat tasted like as if they dropped it and washed it with water... awful taste... spent 60 dls and we barely eat half... a complete disappointment... will not comeback there or reccomend it.</Review>

Only 1 start just because the food was good but the service wasnt welcoming very rude. Ordered a soda and got horchata and then I went to go get a refill and the lady says" $1 dollar refill cant u read" huh which it did say $1 refill but on the soda machines on the other wall. So then on my way out I top my cup off with ice same lady says " $1 refills apply every time" rudely I replied back" for ice its $1 " then walked out</review>

The meat here is pretty tasty and well seasoned.  I liked the cabeza, but wasn't a fan of their asada.  I personally prefer bigger pieces of asada, with some more char to it.  The avocado salsa was good.  The agua fresca I had was too sweet for me.  Chips are ok.< /review>

Such a great place to sit in and have a meal with someone or even alone. The staff here are always helpful and friendly (even during crazy busy lunch hour😉) The shrimp cocktail is my son's favorite all time order and I like the regular bean and cheese burritos.👍👍👍👍</review>

Best shredded pork you'll have in the central coast. I'm not kidding. $10 ish for lunch unless you skip the rice and beans. free chips and salsa IF you buy food. seating is hard because it was a Foster's Freezer for a long time. needs to be remodeled for 1-2 seaters and the lunch crowd.< /Review>

Prices are high and the food is nothing special.  Reminded me of a school cafeteria.  The salsa bar was horrid, and the dining room was very dirty (I should have walked out as soon as i saw the ripped benches, but the family was hungry.)  The chips were good, but again, the salsa was not.  3 adults and 4 kids ate for $80!!!  We go to taqueria's in San Jose with better food and cost a fraction of what we paid here.  We should have driven back over the mountian.< /review>

Gave this place a few different attempts but I've decided to just let this place fall off my list of decent local taqueria joints.
First time they messed my order up. Second time there carne asada super nachos were unimpressive.</Review>

The food is decent. The service is lacking. They're open late, and that's the biggest selling point. There are better options for Mexican in Santa Cruz.<//text>

The food is delicious, you get good portions. The food deserves a 5. I gave an overal 3 because atleast 4 to 5 staff members sat at a table in the back talking when the tables where not clean and the place is ran down.< /Text>

< Review>
Arguably, one of the best Mexican joints in all of Santa Cruz. I never had a bad experience here. Food is great for its price. What really helps this place stand out is its "Carne en su jugo", a beef stew served with avocado, beans, and a delicious broth. I enjoy savoring it's succulent flavor and with spicy foods, even better. Typically, I put some chili peppers with my stew. Overall, a great place to get some delicious Mexican food.<//Review>

Really good tacos and speedy service! These guys have a really big selection of meats, and the tacos are relatively inexpensive. The atmosphere of the restaurant is kind of bland, and the salsa bar is always pretty messy, which is why I give 4 stars.< /Text>

<text>Best carne en su jugo that I've had from a taqueria! I'm always satisfied after getting food here. I also love that they are open late most days. Lines get long during lunch and dinner hours, but I say it's worth the wait.</text>< pics>

<review>The food was not that great especially the whole fried fish. It wasn't seasoned at all and it had a bad after taste. The tacos were nothing special either. I wouldn't recommend to go here unless you don't have any better place to go around.</review>< pictures>

On sunny days I hit Al Pastor and Birria tacos. On rainy days I hit the Carne en su Jugo. On bad days I hit a Michelada. All three are game changers if you haven’t tried them. Great joint... especially for carnivores.</review>

< Review>
The service can be a little surly and gruff, but the food is fantastic. Taqueria Santa Cruz has some favorites that you just can't get in other taquerias, like birria (bbq goat), carne en su jugo (beef soup), and camarones en mojo de ajo (shrimp in garlic sauce). They could be a little less stingy with their chips (you only get a tiny bag with your meal) but their salsas are delicious.<//Review>

Lackluster service, worst vegetarian burrito I have ever had, inflated prices, gossipy environment and last time I went I found a pebble in my burrito. They replaced it but the new burrito was mostly inedible.

To be more clear, my second or third time coming to this restaurant, the woman at the cash register, who was already very unfriendly, got angry because I asked a man behind me for change so I wouldn't have to break my last twenty. He was more than happy to supply the change but she acted like I was pan handling and told me if I ever do that again she would kick me out and I would be persona non grata. I made a review highlighting her treatment of me that day, as well as previous times where her attitude was equally unkind.

I made the mistake of going in one final time after a late night work out. I ordered the tripas burrito. I tried to be friendly and ask her how she was and I honestly asked if she had seen my review. She said she had.  I was feeling incredibly gracious and even apologized for posting it. She said it was fine and that people were even coming in telling her how great she was because of it. I was genuinely happy she was able to receive positively because of my review.

I left with my daughter and I' s food. I got inside my vehicle, took a bite and bit down on a huge pebble, and what appeared to be pieces of rocks. I brought back the burrito and asked her sincerely if it was retribution for the review I wrote. She said she was insulted by my inquiry. She said that it was normal for tripas burritos to have pebbles in them. She refused to refund my money and offered a replacement burrito.

Again, I made the mistake of going along instead of insisting on a refund. This time I chose a vegetarian burrito, hoping it would be pebble free. I even kept glancing at the guys making it. It was the worst burrito I had ever tasted. Maybe some folks like feta and lettuce galore in their burrito but not me! It got tossed, even though I normally don't waste food.

As an empath and  single mom of three, I feel everything deeply. Kindness and lack thereof. In a way, the unkindness serves me too, because it has taught me deep, tearful  gratitide for kindness and people who choose kindness. This place has taught me deep gratitude for good food (pebble free), good service, and of course, kindness. May we all choose more and more kindness, especially since we all depend on it.

I hope this helps and thank you for reading.< /review>

Your order is missing things and you have no way to complain. Quesadilla strange, unlike any other restaurant. The fish taco came with tomato instead of the fish.

(Translated by Google) The food is good the only bad thing is the service by one of the cashiers is nothing more than the owner's niece and gives a very bad service since neither the own daughters of the owners attend with an attitude as arrogant as this girl does ... heck before all there must be humility and attention to others very badly by this girl

(Original)
La comida es buena lo único malo es el servicio por parte de una de las cajeras  no es más que la sobrina del dueño y da un muy mal servicio ya  ni las propias hijas de los dueños atienden con una actitud tan arrogante como lo hace esta muchacha ... caray antes que todo debe de existir humildad y atención a los demás muy mal por parte de esta muchacha</Review>
