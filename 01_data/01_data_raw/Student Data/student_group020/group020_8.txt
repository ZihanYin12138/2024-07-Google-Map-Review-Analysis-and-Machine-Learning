<Text>I’ve been going to Tony for years and he’s been great every time. He asks necessary questions and gives quality advice. He’s great w/ first-timers, those who have tattoos already and everyone in between. Tony’s skills are incredibly diverse like Traditional American, Traditional Japanese and even cover-ups. I’ve been to a handful of other tattoo artists over the years but I always comeback to Tony and I recommend him regularly.< /Text><rating>5<//rating>< name>

<rate>5</rate><text>My cousin and I walked into Above All with a pretty short window to get a tattoo since I was visiting from out of town and had a flight that day. Kurt worked with us right away, he was super cool, wicked friendly and accommodating. He was able to come up with the exact pieces we wanted on the fly. Since I had to leave, he even let my cousin come back later the same day to get his piece finished. Awesome customer service and both of the tats look sick. His line work is really clean. I had a great experience working with him! Def recommend!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I’ve been trying to get the other side of my nose pierced for awhile now and every time I’ve tried to go to a shop they’ve always been closed or their piercer wasn’t in. I called Sideshow and he suggested I go a couple feet down the street to Above All and ask for Scooter. I’m so glad I did that because now I have a new favorite shop that I will go to anytime I want a piercing or tattoo done. To start with, they took me as a walk-in without hesitation. Already 5/5. They asked me what it was I want done and the immediate response was “let’s do it!” I absolutely loved the enthusiasm, so this pumped me up. Now the actual piercing process — Scooter was INCREDIBLE! I can tell he’s very serious about pleasing his customers because he really took the time to make sure that everything was perfect with my piercing. I have a hoop on one side of my nose and wanted a stud on the other and he really went above and beyond to make sure the placement was perfect and even. He’s also super friendly, funny, and professional! He made me feel very comfortable the whole time. He even gave me a brand new and beautiful hoop for the other side of my nose that looks SO much better with my new piercing than my old hoop. Scooter definitely knows what he is doing and I will 100% go back to get more piercings from him. Overall 10/10 experience. Thank you Scooter and thank you Above All!< /Review>

I was sent to this shop when the original shop I was at ran out of jewelry. I had never been to Above All Tattoo before, but I am very happy I got my septum pierced here. The shop is very clean, the staff are all super nice, and Scooter, the person who did my piercing, is awesome! I was really nervous and Scooter was super reassuring, nice, and personable. If/when I get another piercing, I will definitely go back to Scooter. I also plan to go back for a tattoo, they have amazing designs!</Review>

Scooter took his time to make sure the piercing was in the best place for my septum. I appreciated the time and thoughtfulness Scooter took for me! He was very funny and gave me a lot of great tips on hiding if needed and after care. He gassed me up after, and he was right, it was made for my face. I will be back for more!<//text>

Love Kurt he did an amazing side piece for me over a few sessions . I get non stop compliments ! In addition to being super talented he’s a solid guy who takes great care of his customers even after your work is done . If you’re lucky enough to get some work done by Kurt you will not be disappointed !< /Text>

<Review>Scooter was so great! My 14 year old daughter had an appointment somewhere else for her bday and they were so rude and took our $20 appointment deposit. They turned us away because she only brought her school ID and not her birth certificate for an ear piercing. Even though her Mom was with her and we  both had IDS. So we decided to find somewhere else. We walked in to Above All and Scooter was friendly and made her feel super at ease. He spent a lot of time making sure the piercing was exactly where she wanted it. Even spaced it out in case at some point she would wanted a third. We would go back again for sure! Thanks Scooter!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<rating>3</rating><Text>I did a walk in on a Wednesday, only one artist was available being kurt. He was great at first but through out made me feel awkward. I tried to tweak small things about my tattoo and he came back with things saying that’s not his style or that would be to realist. I told him things I wanted to change and he did some what. It’s supposed to be a some what symmetrical sternum tattoo. He was pretty bossy as to not move, while trying to cover my breast because I was slightly uncomfortable having them out and exposed while waiting as he set up. ( there were people walking around the shop and in the piercing room right next to us with an open window) I did agree I was ok with having them out as he obviously wasn’t going to let me cover them or offer to tape a paper to them or anything. I agreed because I had already paid the 500 he requested thinking this would be a finished tattoo, instead i just got an outline that took under an hour to do. He had told me it would be an outline only after I paid. He then casually mentioned his hourly rate was 250. Just felt cheated. He was alright otherwise, his line work is clean, he talked to me and made sure I was ok durning the tattooing. Also I did not sign ANY paper work or liability forms. All he  did was look at my ID. Kinda sketch. I guess bring stuff you won’t expect to bring to cover yourself bc they’re not gonna offer it. Ok experience just awkward, rude and bossy.<//Text>< pictures>

I got my second ear piercing and a belly button piercing there and I had a great experience. Scooter was my piercer and he was fantastic. He walked me through the whole process and took his time to make sure everything was how I wanted it. I would definitely go there again.</text>

The nose piercing I received from scooter was hands down the best I’ve had. Perfect placement all the past ones I’ve taken out because they weren’t long enough and or the placement wasn’t good for a hoop. He nailed it and I’m super excited for him to do the other side. Thanks again!!! So happy with my opal nose ring too!</text>

Luke Stewart was the perfect person to go to for my first tattoo. He is a great artist, and listens to his clients.  He also did his best to keep me calm.  I was freaking out when I heard the needle and i jumped out of my seat, but he told me it was gonna be okay.  Luke gave me breaks when necessary, listened when I told him "i can't take anymore", and  he taught me how to take care of my tattoo after it was all done.</Review>

I went to scooter who I’ve been seeing for 8 years now and he gave me the best piercings!! He started with my septum 8 years ago and today did my lobes, nipples and got new jewelry  in my septum and it turned out perfect. He’s super talented, always makes sure the piercing is perfect and always educates me on the process, care, etc. plus he’s just dope to talk to. Go see scooter!< /Review>

I went in with my sister and we both got tattoos by kipper!  I have plenty of tattoos before so I’m not new to the whole experience. We did some research before we went in and got lucky with Kipper being available! Totally did a great job and would recommend to anyone. Kipper even talked me out of doing a bad tat on my fingers. So I upgraded to wrist. Couldn’t be happier<//text>

My mom and I went in to get tattoos of handwritten notes from my little brother who passed away 2 weeks prior. It was my moms first tattoo. Skoobie was very patient and you could see that he really wanted to match our tattoos as exact as possible to my brother’s handwriting, and we appreciated that it seemed as important for him as it was to us. Thank you.</Text>

I came here over the summer to consult for a cover up on my lower back. Cecelia helped me pick out an idea for the cover up. She was much more optimistic about working over the old tattoo than previous artists. So far i have had 4 sessions and im very happy with the results.< /Review>

< Review>
I came here with a friend of mine who asked me to go with her to get her Above All Tattoo - Pacific Beach. Didn't think I'd get one myself but was happily surprised at how sick the Above All Tattoo - Pacific Beach was so I did it.<//Review>

< review>
Went in there when my wife was getting tattooed and immediately had to get some work done. Iv been to multiple other shops and this one is by far all around quality and just pure artistic masterpieces. They have no problem working with you and your wants and creating your masterpiece that’s in your mind and put it on your skin. I will for sure be coming back as often as I possibly can. I have another appointment in a few weeks and going to schedule another one. My artist is Zeph and that guy is the most easy going and reliable artist I have met. He is working on a piece that means the world to me and he is crushing it. 10 out of 10 recommend anyone who wants quality work for good prices to come here. All their artists have their unique skill sets and if one can’t do what you want they will refer you to the others in the shop. No matter what you will get what YOU want in the end</review>

I’ve been coming here for years and can say the guys at this shop go above and beyond to make sure that you get what you want.  The shop is clean and comfortable and the guys are genuine  and very understanding of what you want. They aren’t pushy and even help bring your ideas to life. Bean has been my artist over the past few years and is currently finishing my sleeve. He is extremely artistic and has helped make the ideas I have even better by sharing what he thinks would look awesome based on my own personal style. He’s honest and has put a lot of work into all the pieces he has created for me and I can’t think of anyone else who I trust more to get a tattoo from.  10 out of 10 would recommend Above All Tatoo for anyone wanting a tattoo or piercing.</Review>

Second tattoo from my artist Bennett. I wouldn't consider using anyone else. His line work and eye for color are what I wanted in an artist. You can rest easy knowing you're in good hands. Good vibes as well. It still hurt like hell but thanks for the masterpiece.< /text>

I would definitely recommend this shop but if you do get a tattoo the man you need to go to is Bennett, the dude is so freakin good with tattoos. He was very professional and very kind and enjoys talking with you while you get your tattoo. And also Bennetts buddy Snoopy is very friendly I would definitely recommend him too. Great work Bennett can wait to get another tattoo form you when I come to San Diego again!!<//Review>

I came in to get an ouroboros under an existing tattoo. Eddie told me that wouldn’t be a problem after showing him the art and the tattoo I wanted it to be placed underneath. When I came back 3 hours later I was told the my existing tattoo was not in line with my spine and he suggested some geometry to hide the discrepancy. I agreed as I was freaking out about the misalignment. In reality this could’ve easily been fixed with a couple of dots. What I got was sloppy, uneven lines in the geometry that he added to my existing tattoo. He didn’t even offer me a mirror to check the line work on my back and I had come alone to get the tattoo. I should have said “no” at this point but I trusted that the artist knew what would be best. I’m ashamed that I even agreed to this as it was not what I wanted in the first place. I think he honestly just wanted to make a little extra money and didn’t care how he got it. At least the snake turned out okay.< /text>

<review>I would not recommend getting a piercing from here. I got a helix piercing here and I had to take it out the next day because it was crooked and the placing was very bad. I called to try to get a refund and they do not refund piercings if you don’t like them after. A tattoo artist I talked to about a refund was also very rude to me and said that the piercer would give me “a refund and a massage” and would give me “a free piercing and candy” which was pretty unnecessary and not a great way to deal with an unhappy customer. I will definitely not be coming back here and I recommend just paying a little more and going to Enigma down the street from them for piercings, I’ve never had issues with their piercings.</review><response>None</response><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

Such an amazing experience getting a tattoo with my best friend sam. It was special because joe “skoobie” Gave us our matching tattoos and I grew up with him. He is so talented as an artist and it’s awesome to see how far he has come with his ability to draw..

Above all tattoo is such a great place it’s got the best atmosphere and vibes

We both got matching I’m Busy. Tattoos 🤙🏼

Anyways how cool that it’s now 2-29-20 a leap year and we won’t have another feb 29 for 4 more years...

Pick me.
Can’t wait to continue getting more masterpieces<//text>

I was a walk in appt. and they immediately got me in and started.  I don't know if Arty I still there, but he was a fellow Minnesotan.  They even played Atmosphere when we were there! LOVE this place! If I'm ever back in PB? I would definitely stop by and get some more work done.  Cheers!✌🏼✌🏿✌🏽</review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><text>GO TO RICK!! I had been looking for someone to do a cover-up for awhile, and I was pretty scared and hesitant to trust anyone. Rick sensed this and was SO patient and helpful. He listened to what I wanted and created something even better than I imagined! I am LOVING this tattoo -- what a huge improvement! After seeing it, I had a friend tell me that my tattoo made him love tattoos and that it was a true work of art -- and that is exactly what it is! Rick is kind, patient, and incredibly talented and professional. That can be hard to find. You are in good hands with Rick!<//text>< Pics>

Bennett was dope! He drew something up that I wasn’t feeling, so he drew up another design without hesitation. Turned out better than I expected! I wanted it positioned lower, but I trusted him when he said it’ll look better higher and he was right. Trust your artist!< /review>

My wife and I arrived at the shop just before opening and were still waiting until 15 minutes after when the guy who’s opening the store gets out of his car. He’d been sitting there, knowing we were waiting. After he opened we gave him a few minutes to get settled then went in. We tried to explain what we wanted,  looked up pictures for him and sent them to his phone. He started telling us there were issues in being able to actually tattoo it. We showed him the phrase we wanted and he told us he needed us to find it in the exact script we wanted. Then he told us we needed to use a computer to print it all out just the way we wanted so that he wouldn’t have to spend time drawing it up. We told him we didn’t have access to a PC since we were on vacation, he continued on and we realized he just didn’t want to do the work. We said thanks anyway and left. He then texted my wife something snarky as though we just refused to understand his situation, she stood up for herself, he then continued to harass her via text, calling her “unintelligent” among other things. We found another shop and in 10 minutes the artist had it worked up and was ready to go.<//review>

<Text>BENNETT!!  He definitely knows what he's doing. I had never felt so comfortable & at ease, I knew I was in good hands. He transformed a half assed chest piece into something better than I had imagined.
If I could put 6 stars,  I would.<//Text>< gmapID>

Didn't seem to have a lot of artists working there, but the ones who were were good. Steve is a great guy and does a great peircing job. The shop is very clean and they talk you through the whole process.< /Review>

Went here for a tattoo a couple years back. Had good service and the art is amazing. Long story but my mom was taking me to get a tattoo. This would be my second tattoo but my first tattoos are very hidden so the tattoo artist probably thought is was my first (i have twp stars where the sun dont shine in my pants lol). Anyway, he felt the need to put numbing cream on my skin when i specifically asked to not have it (my family believes if you need numbing cream you dont deserve the tattoo lol). But that is literally my only complaint.

Tattoo shop is very clean and organized. Their art books are amazing. Theyre very nice and family oriented, my mom didnt feel uncomfortable at all. Shes the one who picked this shop out!< /text>

I would recommend lifetime eye Care optometry to anyone and everyone I'm already notified three members of my family and have scheduled visits for my children. This is the best optometrist I've ever experienced period, when I left I understood what I was getting and why.
Thank you Johanna and Doc🙌🏼🤗< /review>< Pics>

Dr. Yvonne was awesome. She tolerated my quirky sense of humor. Usually people don’t even pay attention when I list my job as a cat psychiatrist. I went in there because my wife just wouldn’t stop nagging me. I didn’t feel like anything was wrong with my sight......I was surprised after going through the eye exam that my vision was poor in my left eye. Dr Yvonne has the patience of a saint as well as a friendly staff who I’m sure was glad to see me leave since I am very obnoxious when discussing cats. All in all, a great experience and I was seen right at the time of my appointment which I always appreciate.< /Text>

The entire experience was wonderful from start to finish. I felt completely safe and thoroughly appreciated all of the extra health precautions that were put in place. The staff and doctor were incredibly friendly and inviting. They even helped me decide on a fresh, new pair of glasses - after I had narrowed it down to a final three. Definitely a loyal customer moving forward!<//Review>

<text>Yvonne and her team do not care about customer service or righting wrongs. Instead they will do the bare minimum to get by.

Ex:  When we were comparing my old eye prescription and the new one. My eyes kept seeing the best at my old prescription.
We had a disagreement over the effectiveness of the new prescription. Eventually she told me that the slide I had a hard time seeing was going to be my new prescription and the one I saw best with was my old prescription.

So I agreed and left with this new prescription that in my gut I knew was wrong.  I waited 6 months to fill that prescription but I needed new glasses. The new prescription was way off just like I thought it would be after my visit with Yvonne.

After 3 weeks of attempting to adjust to my new lenses I went back to talk to Lifetime Eyecare team to see what can be done, but because I had waited past their 90 day policy they only offered for me to pay for a new consultation and glasses. This is despite the lady in front admitting the new prescription was very different from my old prescription. She also admitted she could see the difference in the lenses just looking at them. I lost over $300 and time I will never get back.

Its a shame that they dont let new patients know about their policy even if its in the paperwork you fill out. A simple, "Hey if you have any issues with your glasses come back before 90 days and we can fix it for you." would of been helpful.

Learn from my mistakes and dont let any "professional" bully you. Don't waste your time or money on questionable prescriptions.<//text><pics>None<//pics><userid>110024499506147375032</userid></record>

I absolutely loved the entire experience! The Optometrist was amazing! As well as the staff!! They  whole heartedly took my family of 5 to all be examined and fitted for glasses with the sweetest attitudes! I would gladly recommend anyone to visit this facility!! You will not be disappointed 👌🏽</Review>

Dr. Weisz has great bedside manner. She is thorough during exams. The glasses selection is small, however they can order any style/brand. The receptionists are friendly and efficient. Happy to support a local, women-owned and operated establishment.<//text>

I’ve been a patient at Lifetime Eyecare for 6 years and I am very happy with their service. The staff is friendly and helpful and I get excellent customer service. The efforts made by the staff and the clean and sanitized environment really made me feel comfortable when visiting during the COVID pandemic. I would definitely recommend Lifetime Eyecare to all.</Text>

Yvonne is absolutely a wonderful optometrist.  The staff are friendly.  Yvonne was patient with my children who were challenging to get their eyes checked.  All the products our family ordered has always arrived on time and always correct.  Almost no wait for appointments and always answers their calls.  The environment is more laid back and it's right next to one of my favorite coffee shops.  Overall I can't be any happier.  I'm sorry for anyone that had a negative experience.   It's always best to communicate with people how you are not satisfied and maybe they can give you a discount. Just a tip.</text>

1st time visit at Lifetime Eyecare Optometry.
Dr. Yvonne Weiscz & her staff are all very polite & professional. I was able to have everything I needed done from one first appointment, & not having to go back & forth to several. It made it very convenient for me.
Dr. Weiscz reassured me that she is going to take good care of my eyesight, which made my day!!👀😊</Review>

Very happy with the service we received from Lifetime Eyecare! Will keep coming back for our regular check ups. Dr Weisz is wonderful and so is her employee's at the front desk, she referred me for my Lasik surgery which was one of the best things I have ever done. My 16 year old teenager is very happy having her as her optometrist as well. Thank you Lifetime Eyecare!< /Text>

After calling around to several places, my family found this place that would accept the vision insurance we have.  They were able to schedule all 3 of my family members in on a Saturday to be worked into a full schedule and advised that we may have to wait.  The wait was not long and both the staff and doctor were very nice and professional.  I will definitely be returning and would highly recommend this eye doctor to anyone inquiring.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I have been going to this place for years.  I have always felt I was being overcharged, but the last time I went proved it.  I stopped in to ask Dr. Weiss if I had a sty. All I wanted was a quick yes or no, simple enough.  She took me to the back and looked at my eye (which was unnecessary), and gave me somewhat of a diagnosis and prescribed an ointment. This took less then 10 minutes.  After the diagnosis she said she would charge me for the visit, but would not charge me for follow up visits.  I jokingly said I hoped it wouldn't break the bank, as I do not have vision insurance.  When she took me to the front she told me my 10 minute visit would be $90!  I nearly hit the roof.  She then asked the receptionist what they could do. They said $69, she countered with $79. Are you kidding me?  Bartering the price?  Unbelievably UNPROFESSIONAL! I asked them to take my medical insurance, as I was not there for an eye exam, and I was given a prescription for a medical issue.  They refused to even check my insurance.  Needless to say I will never be going back, and If i could give a negative rating I would.  I truly believe the positive reviews have been written by her staff!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1579824981488, 'text': 'We really do appreciate this feedback, Tracy.'}<//resp>< gmapID>

The worst experience I have had in the 25 years that I have been wearing glasses/ contacts. It was the first and last visit with Dr Yvonne. I book an appointment based on her previous reviews, location and she accepts my eye insurance. Her equipment is outdated and filthy. Her selection of eyewear is slim, out of style and does not carry designer glasses. It took more than three weeks after my visit to obtain my prescription and that's only because I requested my eye insurance company get involved and contact Dr. Yvonne's office on my behalf to have it ready for me. Prior to contacting my insurance, I requested my Rx on three occasions far too many considering the prescription usually rendered at the end of the eye exam. So I asked for it once I payed for my portion of the visit and was told it would be ready when I pick up my contacts. I picked up my contacts 2 weeks later on a Friday  and was told Dr. Yvonne was not present to sign it but would email it to me on Monday. Monday came and nothing. I called 2 days later on Wednesday and was told the same thing that Dr Yvonne was not in to sign it and that she was not done with my chart. Way too long to finish a standard eye chart considering I am only nearsighted. Disappointed with the office and service provided and I will not be returning.<//review>

<Text>Highly disappointed with their customer service.  Very knowledgeable doctor, but because of office staff will not return.

<Text>The most unprofessional optometrist I've ever encountered! She was pushy, rude, rushed me and when I couldn't read a letter (in an irritable voice) she would tell me to guess or would say the letter for me. The prescription was terrible and my sister whom went in the exam room at a separate time said the exact thing. She was sick, she coughed on everything then touched my face and eyes with no gloves. The girls at the counter were very kind, but Yvonne should retire because she was absolutely unprofessional. Hope I don't get sick!< /Text><rating>1</rating><Resp>{'time': 1579825049519, 'text': 'We really do appreciate this feedback, Akiko.'}< /Resp>< pictures>

First time learning how to surf was a blast! Lily was a great instructor and Joe was a fantastic photographer. We will come here again next time we're in SoCal!<//text>

Had a great experience! We got Phil as the instructor and he was amazing! Super cool, knowledgeable, and he also guides you while you try to surf on your waves. If you are learning how to surf for the first time, this class is highly recommended! Take this class before you decide to buy a surf board! 👍👍👍 time flew by, but was  exhausted by the end of the session!<//Review>

Dave was a fantastic instructor and was remarkably patient and kind with our kids (18 and 13). He took first time surfers and converted them into wanting more. We truly loved the experience and I would highly recommend Banzai and Dave ! The experience was safe and at no time did we feel any apprehension.< /text>

Awesome surf experience for my kids & husband at Banzai Surf School with Instructor Dave. Within the first ten minutes in the water they were all up on their boards and riding the waves. So impressed with the professionalism, teaching, and non stop fun that was provided and HIGHLY recommend for that “surf experience”! They can’t wait to come back and do it again.<//Review>

Today my husband and I were fortunate to have Bryce from Banzai Surfing teach me a little bit about surfing, and I learned that I can do so much more than I think I can. If you are thinking about lessons I highly recommend this place, Bryce loves to surf and he's such a good coach. I was way better than I thought I would be! I didn't think I'd be able to pop up on the board once, much less learn to adjust my stance and even turn a little on those baby waves. Bryce helped me troubleshoot and improve on every wave. I'm gonna be so sore tomorrow but it was so worth it haha! Thanks Bryce! 💙🏄🤙🏻< /text>

Our group of 15 had never surfed before, and these surf instructors were great to work with. The beginner surfing lessons allowed all of us to get up and enjoy the waves! They made it so convenient by having a professional photographer and lunch available as well. These surf instructors are amazing.< /Review>

I took a group lesson on 1/3/20 with Frank. As a complete beginner, this is good place to start for all ages. Highly recommend this place. Frank is great instructor, and takes care of his students in and out of water. Good experience overall.<//text>

Great experience! The location is perfect: nice sandy bottom and not at all crowded. Phil has been surfing for longer than most of us have been alive and has so much to share. He was encouraging and pushed me beyond just being able to stand. Highly recommend the open group lessons at 11. If you get lucky, like I did, you might only have 1 or 2 people in a class which is a bargain!<//text>

<Review>We booked a three-day package for two ten-year-old boys this week and had a really great experience with Banzai. One of the boys has surfed before and was really into it. The other was more timid. I got in the water to help but the instructors took really great care of both of them - both skill levels were tailored to. Over the three days we had Peter, Ian, Tori and Breezy as instructors and they were all really encouraging and patient with both kids. I’m addition to having a lot of fun, I felt like the kids were really safe. I would definitely recommend Banzai and we will be using them again when we are in town.<//Review>< pictures>

WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!! This company is awesome, so we booked them for a company teambuilding event , Jaz went above and beyond accommodating us, they booked the cabana for us got firewood, had an extra table and canopy for us and even provided some catering options. the setup was great and the cost was very fair. The experience of the sure lessons was even better, each instructor was amazing, thank you team banzai, they were supportive , patient and very easy to get along with,  we had originally booked lessons for about 45 people between 9 and 12, but as more and more coworkers heard about how fun it was they went and tried to signup and Jaz didn't turn anyone away, they squeezed in upwards of 70 people in doing the lessons and stayed longer than planned. our company had a great time and we really appreciate everything. if you are looking for a one stop shop this is it!!!< /Text>

We booked a three-day package for two ten-year-old boys this week and had a really great experience with Banzai. One of the boys has surfed before and was really into it. The other was more timid. I got in the water to help but the instructors took really great care of both of them - both skill levels were tailored to. Over the three days we had Peter, Ian, Tori and Breezy as instructors and they were all really encouraging and patient with both kids. I’m addition to having a lot of fun, I felt like the kids were really safe. I would definitely recommend Banzai and we will be using them again when we are in town.< /Text>

Booked a private lesson for the kids and myself. Had a fantastic time, kids and I progressed really well with great tuition, support and encouragement from Phil and Luke. Saw a pod of Dolphins playing in the waves just offshore too, bonus! Highly recommend Banzai for that once in a lifetime chance to surf on the famous Huntington Beach. Thanks guys.<//Text>

<text>I had an amazing time with Big Wave Dave, as he taught me the basics of surfing. I have never been surfing before and I can confidently say I am going to come again on my own. Truth be told I would recommend Banzai to any aspiring surfer or anyone who has the interest. They did a wonderful job.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

We had a 20+ person family group with mostly teens and younger kids in a 2 hour session. As parents, we thought it would be total chaos but Bonzai had almost as many instructors in the water as people in our group. Every child and adult got up and rode waves. The instructors were engaging and had the kids totally comfortable in the waves. Definitely the highlight of our week in Southern CA. Don’t go to Disneyland or Universal Studios....Do this!!!</text>

<Text>Banzai is the best.  Family of 5 (two teens, one 8 year old and a mom and dad in their mid 40's) had a fantastic time!  Totally worth every penny.  Instructors were super enthusiastic and everyone was up on their feet and surfing the first or second try.  Photography package is recommended - I now have 150 quality photos of the whole family surfing together on our vacation.  Surf Banzai!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
This surf school is very rude to people enjoying the beach. I have two small children and we were the only people at the beach. They set up directly behind us (about an hr after we setup) and once they started their lessons, they ran over my kids in the ocean. There wasn’t a sole in the ocean except my family and they ran us over in the ocean. We made comment to an instructor about being more aware of others and the instructor brushed it off as no big deal. Obviously, this school has no regard for the safety of others. Such a shame that they would set a poor example or not teach these new surfers to be cautious of others when they are in the water.</Review>

<Text>My husband and I took our first ever lessons today at Huntington Beach, Surf City!  Banzai Surf School is awesome, and the people running it are even better.  Our instructor Thomas made it so much fun and made sure that we had the best experience!  We both loved every second of it, and would come back again and again.  I can't wait for our next lesson.  Thank you, Thank you!

Having no background or knowledge on surfing or how waves work and what time they peak, coming from out of the country, I called them asking if they’re open and if they’re offering classes despite it being February. The guy made a few condescending comments, when I told him I’m not I understand and that I was interested in exploring surfing lessons, he made a sarcastic laugh and hung up in my face. Not sure if they hate people with accents or anything else but I know never to call this place again</Review>

<Text>My fiance and I took surf lessons 2 days ago with Banzai.  Let me start by saying that we had a FANTASTIC experience.  Phil was our instructor for the day, and I would definitely recommend him.  He had years of surfing experience and a great enthusiastic attitude that was well suited for instructing.  The lesson consisted of on shore instructions (standing up, paddling technique, etc.), beach and ocean facts/ information, and as much in-water time as we could physically take!  Both my fiance and I were both able to ride some waves after instruction.  While we paid for the 2 hour lesson, Phil gave us nearly 4 hours of his time (that's right, 4 hours!!).

Do yourself a favor, if you're looking for surf lessons in HB, come to these guys, they won't let you down.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dd204e4c37d24f:0x59b6c8358c65dfc3</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

It is always unnerving planning a trip, not knowing what to expect when you book a vendor. Our experience with Jaz and his crew was great. He responded to all emails quickly, spent time answering all my questions in detail, and provided us all the information we needed before we arrived. They were already set up at the beach when we got there half and hour early, the lesson started on time and was relaxed and unhurried with no one checking the clock to see when it was done. We and our sons (5 and 7) had a great time - we would definitely book with them again next time we're in town.<//review>

Love, love, loved them. The Matts were awesome teachers (and the blonde one is so cute!) and I had the best time ever. I was surprised at how quickly I picked up on it with their help as well, considering I'm a Canadian with 0 experience in any board sports. I actually rented a board and went out myself the very next day! So fun. You'd be a fool if you got your surf lessons anywhere else.<//review>

I wanted to let you know that we had a great time today, and I could not be more impressed! Phil and Aaron were awesome and were able to make it fun for us while teaching... Phil was especially patient with me and made sure I got up and rode a wave. Surfing was a bucket list item for us...so glad we chose Banzai!

Was in town and decided to spontaneously take a surf lesson. Booked with these guys easy peasy less than 24 hours in advance, and they took me despite the fact I would be the only student out that day. Never made me feel like an inconvenience. My instructor was Phil and he was a great teacher - wish I'd been able to do two hours. Will definitely return.< /Review>

Took my first surf lesson ever with Reggie, asked us both if we had any athletic background and worked very hard with us to make sure we got on the board and catch some waves. Overall, a total blast, learned a lot and the patience and vibes from the whole team was phenomenal.
I'll definitely be heading back there for more lessons.< /Text>

I contacted Jaz at Banzai Surf School a few months before our trip to Los Angeles.  I wanted my son and daughter to try surfing during our visit but I was concerned about my son because he has some special needs.  I explained what I needed and that I understood if his issues were going to be a danger he shouldn't go, but Jaz was very accommodating and went out of his way to make sure the lessons were a great success.  The instructors we had were enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and knew how to make my son feel at ease and confident.  We liked it so much we booked a second lesson instead of visiting Hollywood. The kids both assure me the surfing lessons were way more fun than Disneyland!< /text>

My daughter did a 2 hour lesson with Brad while we were vacationing in So California last week!  We couldn't have been happier!  The owner himself called me to discuss our needs and perfectly matched the most amazing instructor to work with my daughter!!  I can't say enough about Brad!  He was PERFECT!
If you are on the fence about choosing Banzai, take the chance, you will not regret it!!

<review>We did a large company party of thirty people, and Banzai Surf was top notch all the way. They promply returned our many email inquiries, phone calls, billing issues, etc.  The instructors (there were many :) were informative and entertaining, and the equipment was top of the line (I think; I'm no pro surfer, but much closer :). They even had full wetsuits and a "fleet of battleships" for the XXXL members of our group. Highly recommended.< /review><name>Herve Blanquart< /name><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

I work with Nike and we had meetings in the Huntington Beach area and decided to try surf lessons as our team building.  There were a lot of options in the area, but honestly no one had more personality and energy that Jaz.  Also, his team was incredible with the lessons.  Small successes on our part were met with high-fives and cheering from the instructors.  We have memories and photos of our event that no one will soon forget.  There are certainly other options for surf lessons in the area, but going with anyone but Banzai would be a wipeout :)

Thanks Jaz and team for a memorable day.  I'm hooked and consider myself a surfer now!<//text>

<Text>Our family generally loves our Handel’s desserts. We have been to several of their locations and so decided to give this location a try as it is closer to us.

We got a few different flavors of ice cream and we loved it. Absolutely nothing to complain about. They offer a variety of sizes for different price points. We generally get the smallest size (since we can try several flavors that way) and even that’s really not small - there is enough for everyone. My favorite has always been the Dark Cherry which was fantastic as usual - but have to say the Key Lime is almost as good! Tried a couple of others as well and they were generally very good too. They also appear to have treats for the pets, but we haven’t tried it with ours lest they get addicted!!

This specific location is great also because it’s right across from the beach. There were several groups of beach goers lined up ahead of us to order but things moved along very efficiently. I highly recommend Handel’s ice cream and this location is great if you want to sit at the beach eating your dessert!<//Text>< Pictures>

Really good stuff. The hardest part was picking a flavor to try. Definitely will be back for more.<//Text>

Finallllly good ice cream on the peninsula. Only complaint is not being able to get 2 flavors unless you get 3.5 scoops.</text>

Miss the local spot two doors down where you could get a simple scoop of ice cream. I didn't want a foot high $6 ice cream cone. We were fighting to eat them as they melted down our arms. We had a good laugh, but it was miserable. Walk to Pipeline and get a soft serve or frozen banana.</Review>

I feel this place might be over hyped. Good fast service but the flavor is nothing to write home about. Not super creamy but many I got two bad batches? I ended up not finishing my two cones.</Text>

Handles ice cream is my favorite.  It is always so fresh and creamy.  They hire the nicest people and the employees are almost as great as the ice cream!  I always have to order an extra pint to take home.</review>

<Text>Handel’s ice cream is amazing!! So good!! I had gotten the four scoop sampler with graham central station (GCS), oreedough, Blue monster, and buckeye, and it was beautiful. The customer service was quick and very helpful. I had a lot of questions :). Really advise you going and trying out new flavors!!!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This is the “IT” ice cream shop in OC. HANDS DOWN THE BEST ICE CREAM IN ORANGE COUNTY. Probably in all of Southern California. 100% would recommend. The service was fast and friendly. The location is incredible. Ocean view and right next to the Newport Beach pier. The price is very good and the QUALITY! WOW! This Ice cream is the best quality I’ve had. Get the black raspberry chocolate chunk. It’s very good. It’s smooth, creamy, sweet/tart with rich dark chocolate chunks. 10/10. My friends had the Chocolate Hash and the Oree Dough. Everyone loved what they had. This is the perfect place to grab a cone after a quick surf sesh or the perfect treat on a warm beach day. If you don’t go you’ll be missing out. ITS A MUST WHEN VISITING NEWPORT BEACH.</Review>

<review>Portions are huge, small size is a single with 2-1/2 scoops single flavor. Double with option for 2 flavors is 3-1/2 scoops, and bigger from there.  A kid size would be nice, but only option is a small, same price though even if you choose less scoops. Waffale comes or waffale cups available.
Ice cream isnt bad, wide flavor variety, something for everyone including vegan or dairy free options. Parking can be a challenge due to the general location.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I had midnight madness and buckeye
Amazing flavors (midnight madness is dark chocolate with Pb and Pb Oreos, buckeye is peanut butter ice cream with fudge and buckeye candy pieces

He had Oree dough (vanilla with Oreos and cookie dough)

The service was amazing and can't beat the location! Ice cream steps away from the beach

Nice casual atmosphere.  Our cheeseburgers were delicious,  but $9 seemed on the pricey side.  For an additional $4.00 we ordered a salad bar plate.  There were lots of fresh options to choose from. Service was friendly.< /text>

The Boss is the best sandwich on the menu. Awesome red hot sauce. French fries must be eaten hot to really appreciate.</Review>

While the waitress is very nice there was a list of concerns I have about this restaurant. we received a raw burger (still cold in the middle), our appetizer came out 20 minutes after our food, then we received the new burger we noticed that it was the exact one we had sent back that had been somehow reheated? We had also purchased the salad bar but was greeted by dry cheese, wilted lettuce, and a foul rotting smell. All of these things are a huge deal! All of us now are sick including the baby that was with us. I really would not recommend this place until they can pull the restaurant up to code.<//review>

This family run restaurant has a big menu, off highway parking, and friendly staff. Inexpensive, clean, with nice restroom facilities. Home made items, fresh and hot. Generous portions.</Review>

<text>Me and my boyfriend stopped here before our way out of town and it did not disappoint. They had great food suitable for my boyfriend who eats only clean and healthy and then theres me who chose to try the western burger with sweet potatoe fries and we both enjoyed our meal. The service was great and extremely friendly owner. We will definately be back. Thanks</text>< Rating>

Staff was very friendly and beer was good but none of that can save you from the atrocious food. Sounds good on the menu but what shows up is brown lumps. Truly terrible. It’s too bad as I really wanted to like this place.<//review>

Horrible service had yo flag down waitress
Waitress was none existent
Waited for beverage over 15 min
Beer had a hair in it
They brought back another in a smaller glass.
The fish tacos were chincy hardly any fish mostly cabbage .

I was visiting from Texas .
My friend who lives in Chester recommended Yall .
Taco tuesday . on the menu. Saw great reviews on the google site from customers that rave about yalls food .

Customer service is priority to any business.
Food quality is second.
Customer recommendations play hand in hand with any business.

Hope Yall can get it right the next time I visit.
The atmosphere was nice . Enjoyed the inner decor made it feel like a local place to be.

This is a hidden gem. I admit, I scoffed at the "Foodies Eat Here" sign ... but, this place is unique, and serves a very good burger and has local beer on-tap. It's well-worth the stop!<//text>

<Name>Brittany Smith< /Name><Date>1627229940748< /Date><Rating>5</Rating><text>So I decided to try a new coffee place because I ran out of my Starbucks gift cards. Saw all the amazing reviews and gave it a try. I walked in to a well organized, clean, antique coffee shop. The workers were young but very knowledgeable and patient because I had no clue what to order. I eventually ordered Nana coffee with almond milk. I ordered my mom one as well. Let me tell you that first sip was LIFE!! I was so mad a ordered the small size and my mom the large. If you order make sure you stir the goodness that settles to the bottom. Will definitely be back for another experience.< /text>< Pictures>

Good coffee and lots of cool vintage items to check out. Indoor Seating is very limited and some outlets are not working. No bathroom! Definitely worth a visit if you're in National City.<//review>

<Review>Best coffee I’ve ever had. So authentic. The girl who works there knew it was my first time in and was very friendly and helpful with telling me about the selection. The place is very cozy with art and vintage decor. I’ll absolutely be returning. Thank you!<//Review>< Pics>

Nice, little local coffee shop. Good selection of pastries and unique drinks. Location is good, right off nearby streets and freeway. Parking is plentiful in the nearby areas. Other good restaurants in the area as well. Will return in the area again.<//Text>

A postal worker friend recommended this place. I went there on Tuesday for the first time and I was impressed with the cozy vintage decor, vintage lowrider memorabilia and oldies music playing in the background. The service was pleasant and the Cafe de Olla and abuelita coffee were excellent.<//Text>

Sean and Aladdin are amazing! I literally spent 3 days working on a deal (only because I’m busy and brought in someone with experience in financing a car) but left with the biggest smile on my face. They worked the numbers to something I was looking into and LOW rate. Also providing the best warranty they can offer! Let’s say I’m very pleased and satisfied with my purchase!
Thank you so much!<//Review>

If you find yourself here looking for a great deal, look for John! He’s very helpful, not going to force you into buying but will help you get the car you wanted. Seriously, this place is great! Just bought a 2018 Civic Hatchback from them and it rides great!<//Text>

<review>Ahmed and Kat greeted me, and asked me with what I need help with. I let them know I was looking at a 2015 Subaru WRX, and they promptly assisted me on figuring out what I would need to make sure I got the quickest and best deal on the car. Throughout the entire process they were very patient, understanding and kind. Any hurdles we met were quickly dealt with, they had answer for every issue. In the end i was very happy, and satisfied with their customer service, as well as the price i paid for the vehicle. Definitely would check them out if you find a car you're interested in buying. I looked far and wide for a car I felt most comfortable with and I landing on their dealership was the right choice. I thank them for their service.</review><userid>103484411241501699105<//userid>< Date>

Ahmad was the most personable and curtious salesman I have met to date. As a younger sister of an experienced general manger for a car company, I have interacted with a multitude of individuals in this line of work. To say that I felt at ease and well taken care of during my car purchase experience, would be an understatement. I am never the type of person to go out of my way to leave a review. However, I am someone who appreciates and respects quality of service and I would not hesitate to recommend his services nor this dealerships line of cars to any of my loved ones. Please rest assured, you will leave this place a happier person than you entered.< /Text>

Bought my first car purchase here and really had a great experience.
Michael greeted us and was very friendly! He helped us with the test drive and getting us situated with the various forms I needed to sign. An all around personable guy :D
Sean and Adolfo were also very helpful and knowledgeable. Would recommend this place for your next car purchase<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Worse experience EVER. I went ready to buy, only to have them lose the keys to the vehicle. I told them to update me on when the keys will be ready and they never did. I called many time and even texted for updates and seemed as if they didn't even want to sell me the vehicle. So I found the same vehicle in San Diego and made that 2 hour trip rather than deal with unprofessionalism. Called me almost a week later saying the car is ready . Just shows how eager they are to make a sale. FYI if you go ready call and make sure they didn't lose the keys.< /Text>< name>

I wouldn't recommend buying a car from there, We bought a 2014 Ford Focus about 2 years ago and the last year and a half its been in the shop 3 times for Known issues by Ford with Transmission issues, They even have lawsuits for the transmission problems,  the first 2 times I took it to the Ford dealer ship they covered it, and this last time they want $2,000 to fix it, So I took the car to the dealership where we got the car and at first they said yes they will help us out to get a new then they tell us it has to many problems they wont be able to help us out, so they sold us a lemon and I'm sure they knew it had transmission problems and still sold it to us, its a 2014 Ford Focus with only 60,000 miles on it and I can't do anything with the car. DO NOT PURCHASE A CAR THERE, they do not stand by their cars< /text>

Well, yes the few of the people were nice. I did have a problem with one of the cars. Yes I went back and acted up let's  say I was a "KAREN × 100".  After all said and done. I have a car and yet another problem. Hope I don't have to make a drive. Have your manager ready to deal with anything because he is a manager and no matter the time the problem. Your a manger and do your job. Hope not to see them soon. I gave a 4 because of the few. David and Aladdin.< /Text>

This place is  a great friendly atmosphere I went there just to look at different cars as I am going to purchase in  in the near future  I was approached by a salesman named Michael  he was so helpful  and very knowledgeable   I explained to him I was just looking and he was not pushy like usual salesman are all they want is the sale and if they know they are not going to get one then they don’t bother with you but this salesman showed me many cars and gave me specifics on each one knowing I would not be purchasing that day I was very impressed I would  highly recommend Michael  if you  go there he also introduce me to his manager Sean  and he was very professional and very helpful as well and when I am decided on which car  I want to purchase I’m definitely going to go back there. This dealership was also very clean and welcoming and not feeling pressured to purchase until I’m sure of what I want was great  I appreciate all this salesman work with me and I will be seeing him there soon<//text>

< Review>
Went to the dealership to check out a used car. Everyone was very nice. No hard sell pressure. I'll probably end up buying a car from them.

UPDATE: CHANGING FROM 4 STAR to 1 STAR.

I bought a 2016 Mazda3 Grand Touring Hatchback from Sean and Bella at Riverside Premier Motors - The car was advertised as having a navigation system as a feature. The car actually was missing the Official Mazda SD Card that contains the NAV system. I was told that while Riverside does NOT have this in stock but they would order one for me ASAP. They also wrote up an additional bill of sale that said they owed me this part. I gave them about a week and then I contacted Bella via text who said she would talk to her manager. I didn't hear back so I messaged her 3 days later and again she informed me that she would speak with her manager. This process continued for 3ish weeks until she stopped replying to my text messages completely. In addition to the above they tried to add on bogus "security tracking" fees (2k worth) on the car I was paying cash for (not financing in anyway) and lastly they wanted to charge me $~300 for them to tail me home from Riverside to Anaheim after they said they would do it for free if I bought the car.

Here is an image of the security devices that they use  which they were able to unhook from the vehicle in less then 2mins and wanted an extra 2k for.< /Review>

{'time': 1576386642704, 'text': 'It’s pretty disappointing that a person would change their review based on false facts. After dealing with a female sales associate who would not cave to your inappropriate advances over and over and who rejected them, this is how you choose to pay her back for rejection. We have been informed of the inappropriate treatment you gave and it will not and cannot be tolerated. You were not charged for a delivery fee and the gps was optional which you declined. You’re persistence in wanting to “ go out for drinks” that went way too far after nothing but rejection is the reason for you are sour and have this attitude towards the dealer now. Pretty sad to use this platform to attempt to bring down a hard working sales professional for refusing your inappropriate and disrespectful advances. You should be ashamed.'}</Response>

Riverside Premier Motors has the worst customer service . If you have your own financing..Run.... The salesman Michael will lie to you until get to there, then he will bring the  drama, The Manager Shawn will attempt to smooth things over and ultimately lie to your face, and the sales manager Junior has no class and should avoid all customer and business interactions. I feel embarrassed for introducing them to my credit union. They lost an easy sale by lying and attempting to be greedy by inflating prices on made up accessories !!!!!!!!

I was checking out cars and this placed popped up I was talking to David and Everything was good. I made an appointment yesterday since you can't just walk in anymore thanks to Covid-19, but when I got there for my appointment he was busy so he passed me to someone else to help me out a buffoon. I told him I just wanted to check out the cars before I made a decision we checked out the two cars that I was looking at, we went back inside and I asked him couple questions about the down payment and monthly pay, but he really didn't answer my questions he just wanted me to buy the car already. I told him again that I was just checking only and that I would make my final decision on Friday, but that's when his attitude change he stands up went to David irritated and told him out loud so that everyone in the office could here that I wasn't going to buy a car David just looked at me for a cool twenty seconds before saying it was okay. I recommend to everyone to go somewhere else< /text>

Rpm was the best decision I've made in a long time. I've been to about 6 dealership in the past 4 or 5 months and RPM was the dealership that gave me the best deal for and new ride. David calero was the person I spoke to on the phone and was the one who showed me around the lot where I found this new beauty. Not only did they give me the greats deal one a car I've been researching and have done lots of looking around for. David let me test drive the venza and showed me how everything works on it. The whole dealership workers were very very friendly and welcoming. David had the manager give me the best deal they could do on the venza. They offered me an amazing % and a very low payment plan. They also recommend the extended warranty on the vehicle which would help protect the vehicle for an extra 3 years which is perfect. They also offer way more than any other dealership I've been to. I recommend RPM to a friend of mine and they helped him out to get a ride for his son which was cool. They know how to take care of their customers for sure and are willing to work with anyone to have them go home with a new car. Would definitely recommend this place for buying a used car.</Review>

I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone, my fiancé and I got the car we wanted because the staff went above and beyond to make sure we got the best deal possible.
They were very patient, professional and friendly throughout the entire process. This is the type of customer service you expect and hope for when making such a commitment.< /Text>

After dealing with a female sales associate who would not cave to your inappropriate advances over and over and who rejected them, this is how you choose to pay her back for rejection. We have been informed of the inappropriate treatment you gave and it will not and cannot be tolerated. You were not charged for a delivery fee and the gps was optional which you declined. You’re persistence in wanting to “ go out for drinks” that went way too far after nothing but rejection is the reason for you are sour and have this attitude towards the dealer now. Pretty sad to use this platform to attempt to bring down a hard working sales professional for refusing your inappropriate and disrespectful advances. You should be ashamed.'}< /resp>

Went to the dealership to check out a used car. Everyone was very nice. No hard sell pressure. I'll probably end up buying a car from them.

UPDATE: CHANGING FROM 4 STAR to 1 STAR.

I bought a 2016 Mazda3 Grand Touring Hatchback from Sean and Bella at Riverside Premier Motors - The car was advertised as having a navigation system as a feature. The car actually was missing the Official Mazda SD Card that contains the NAV system. I was told that while Riverside does NOT have this in stock but they would order one for me ASAP. They also wrote up an additional bill of sale that said they owed me this part. I gave them about a week and then I contacted Bella via text who said she would talk to her manager. I didn't hear back so I messaged her 3 days later and again she informed me that she would speak with her manager. This process continued for 3ish weeks until she stopped replying to my text messages completely. In addition to the above they tried to add on bogus "security tracking" fees (2k worth) on the car I was paying cash for (not financing in anyway) and lastly they wanted to charge me $~300 for them to tail me home from Riverside to Anaheim after they said they would do it for free if I bought the car.

Here is an image of the security devices that they use  which they were able to unhook from the vehicle in less then 2mins and wanted an extra 2k for.</Review>

They try to give you the run around but even CarMax offered almost 4000 more! Don’t know how the car buying experience is here tho...< /text>< name>

I recently purchased my new car here. After going to a few dealerships coming here was a relief. I was able to get my car at the sticker price out the door with a great interest rate. Junior was straight forward and explained things very clear. Overall I am extremely happy with the service.

<Date>1581219145623<//Date><Review>After weeks of searching I found the SUV I wanted and spoke to Geno to view it on Saturday (it was Thursday) because I lived 40+ miles away.  I asked that he call me if it sold so I didn't waste my time.  I showed up and Geno said it sold 30 minutes before I got there.  After 3 more hours of looking at other options (brands other than what I came for or way out of my limit as a single mom) their system was down so they couldn't guarantee the payment I could afford.  They wanted me to sign paperwork for $60 over my monthly limit and if the deal came back lower, when the system came up, I could go back and resign.  I declined because that seemed shady to me.  The next day Geno texted he had great news and to come down to sign the papers.  No proof of the final monthly payment.  I thanked him for his time but declined the car/deal.  It's now a week later and the same exact ad/SUV is listed on their website.  I even inquired with Geno about it on Tuesday  and his reply was "It's sold.  Sorry it's still on the website".  Typical bait and switch.  I'm still furious for the waste of time, gas, and toll road money to get there.</Review>< username>

John at Riverside Premier Motors was very informative and an amazing salesman. We went in looking for an affordable SUV with a set budget. I have decent credit but knew my budget was a hard stretch. John worked amazing wonders without being pushy and delivered a better deal than I expected. I will refer him to everyone I know! Great company, very friendly associates.<//review>

I went to this dealership after finding the car online, I drove over 50 miles to come see this car, I was eager to get this car. I test drove the car and loved it. So I put down a deposit right then and there, thinking by giving them my money they would keep their word and not sell the car. NOPE!!! They called me the day before my appointment to come purchase the car by telling me they sold it because their manager, Mitch, felt as though I wasn't going to buy the car. I had a DEPOSIT on the car, what else do you want from me to show you I want it? I will never ever recommend this dealership to anyone. I can not believe this customer service, its a joke. If you're looking for a reasonably priced used car avoid this place, they buy their cars at auctions and turn around and overcharge you..< /text>

They had the vehicle I was looking for and negotiated the price masterfully. I got an excellent price for my trade as well. They effortlessly worked with me for vehicle payment making it a pleasurable experience. Special thanks to Bella, Walid, Mike, Frank, Sudima,& Mark (please forgive spelling). I enthusiastically recommend doing business with them and will most assuredly visit again for our next vehicle. Thank you so much guys for making this purchase a complete joy. I am deliriously pleased on all accounts....Andrew R.<//Text>

<Text>I can’t express enough just how amazing this dealership is. It’s the best place I’ve been, with Geno Sanudo being the associate to see. As an international student from Canada who’s in the U.S for university, it is beyond difficult to find places that are willing to work with you since frankly, the United States knows very little on how to deal with people from other countries, especially in terms of finance. This dealership however, made me feel like I was back home. The staff were incredibly friendly (one of them literally went out on his own accord to buy me a tea from Starbucks), extraordinarily helpful, and will get you exactly what you need for unbelievably great prices. I was in and out within a few hours, with a fantastic Volkswagen and a huge smile on my face. A huge hug and thank you to the people of Riverside Premier Motors!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Just got off the phone and asked about the process of trading in a vehicle. Their staff was kind enough to humour my queries and answer them politely, clearly, and concisely (unlike other small car dealerships who wanted me to come in with my title 😱).

So glad this business is professional. Thanks Maggie and transferred lady 😁< /Text>

Good afternoon,

After working with Junior and his professionalism/knowledge of the car industry. I can truly say that I will 100% be bring my business and others to him in the future. He worked with me and my wife with our needs and definitely was attentive to what we were looking/needing for our growing family. His work with the financing was no hassle at all. What we thought was going to be a headache, turned out to be a simple process and for that he has earned mine and my families business. RPM definitely has a trustworthy, respectable & hard working man on their team. On behalf of me and my wife, we thank Junior for all your time and business.< /Review>

I bought a 2014 Nissan Altima today. Victor was extremely helpful and walked me through the whole process at my pace. I told Victor that my credit was not that good and Victor told me not to worry and that they could help me. I got an amazing car that fits me and my family perfect and at the monthly rates that I wished for! Thank you very much Victor! I will definitely recommend to all my family and friends and will return for future purchases!<//text>

RPM goes out of their way to help you get the car you want. I want to thank Junior for helping my husband and I, everything went smoothly and quick! We were so surprised! Junior is very knowledgeable and very professional, knows what he’s doing and will not give you the runaround. They are honest and I highly recommend!< /review>< Pictures>

These guys were very professional. It was definitely a different experience than previous dealerships I have been to. They didn't pressure me and tried to get me exactly what I was going for as far as payments and down payment. Victor in Sales and Junior and finance were great to work with.< /Text>

Junior has always made sure to give me a great deal and treat my family as VIPs. This being the 5th car we buy from RPM I can honestly say that they will always give you great service and a great deal! More importantly they will always make sure the vehicle you buy is in great condition and running perfectly! They don't play games and take care of every customer in the best possible way. I would highly recommend RPM to anyone looking for a great deal on a great car! You can truly have peace of mind buying from the professionals at RPM, they are truly great!<//Review>< pics>

This dealership is full of a bunch of scam artist that like to lie manipulate and deceive you so you'll sign the papers to sell you a car that is a LEMON! ALL THE CARS THEY HAVE ARE LEMONS, DO NOT BE TRICKED BY THESE THIEVES THEY WILL SCREW YOU  OVER, FRANK(GM),

PS. The only person that is a honest dude is RUBEN, he helped me out on the situation when he wasent even the one who sold me the LEMON.< /review>

Filled out an online application and was contacted right away by the finance guys.
Ended up dealing with a young man named Marcus and I am absolutely astounded by his exemplary service. He not only helped me get the car I wanted but was more than willing to strike a deal with me. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to buy their next vehicle to come here and ask for Marcus . A++< /Text>

When I was looking for a car I called a lot of places to get information and it was difficult to get my questions answered. I called riverside premier motors and spoke with Gina and she was amazing. She answered all my questions even scheduled an appointment for me to come in when it was convenient for me. Thank you Gina!<//Text>

I found RPM online and when asked to make an appointment a man named junior called me back and was so friendly and made the process easy to come in and check the car out! When i arrived a man named victor helped me and was so nice and made the whole process simple and explained everything very well ! Nice facility and a staff that actually looks out for your best interest!! If you ever need a car RPM is the way to go!!<//Text>

Buying a car here was one of the best experiences I have ever had at any car dealership here or anywhere else in the country for that matter. Sal made it all come together seamlessly and professionally without any pressure. I will come back here to buy my next car, their inventory is impressive and the cars are in great shape, no junk here. Ask for Sal when you come in.

Jr, Victor, Sal, made this one of the best buying experiences that I ever had. Saw what I wanted and they made it work. Took 2 days,  and that's how you know when a team is working for you.  I knew I was approved and who my finance company was out the door. I can't thank you guys enough. I would give more stars if I could.  Thank you</review>

I was referred to Junior by a family member. He was professional and respectful. I dont have the best credit score but he was able to help me in short period of time. I was turned down by various dealerships but he was able to have me out with my new Mitsubishi with in a few hours. I would have to say Junior is Amazing!</Text>

<text>I had an appointment setup for a week to check out a SUV I had been eyeing.  The sales guy checked in with me at least 4 times during that time to make sure I was coming including the morning of at 9:00 am for my 1:00 pm appt.  Each time I said yes, I'll be there.  I told him previously I was coming from San Diego so it was going to be an hour and a half drive.  However, it was a good price so why not make the drive.  Basically, I was ready to buy after a test drive.  When I get there, I'm told the car was not on the lot.  What?!  They said they had to bring the car to the BMW shop the day before.  Supposedly, there was a recall that needed to be repaired.  Well, it's pretty easy to find out if there's a recall for a car when they list the VIN #.  Guess what, there wasn't a recall.  It makes you wonder if there was even a car.  Regardless, it was pretty F'd up to do that to someone driving from so far away.  Now, can surprises happen?  Sure, but if they knew about it the day before, why not say something sooner?  Oh wait, they called me 5 minutes before I drove onto the lot to let me know the car wasn't there.  Now, they did say they could drive the car to me the next day.  But seriously, why would I want to work with them after that?  And if the car was in the shop for another reason and they didn't want to tell me why, again, do I really want to I buy a car from these people?  Anyway, good luck to anyone else working with them if you're driving from distance.< /text><Name>Jason Elmore</Name>< time>

The atmosphere was very clean but it was a little hard to find, especially if you dont have a route already planned.< /Review><date>1505174494864</date><username>James Ford< /username><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This place is awesome, great prices and great customer service! Riverside Premiere Motors had a great variety of vehicle for me to select. I called their office because there website had a lot of promising vehicles to choose from. The receptionist Gina, was extremely helpful. She walked me thru everything, how to fill out the online application and made an appointment to view those vehicles. She made it very easy and alleviated the stresses of purchasing a vehicle. I'll be in soon to finish up my purchase. Thank you Gina!</Review>

At the time of sale we clearly stated on the Buyers Guide which you signed that we do not give loaners out. We apologize for this inconvenience but we have to go by what our insurance coverage dictates to us. We currently have your automobile on our premises and are doing our best to determine the noice in your vehicle. We are puzzled though at the time of us having your vehicle as it was dropped off a few hours ago not days ago as you stated and exaggerated.

Bought a truck from them and they were very reasonable. They took my trade in that I was upside-down on, paid it off, and started me fresh with the truck. They really try and work with you and break down the numbers for you so you know what's going on and they'll work with you to get the price that fits your budget. Ask for Ramzi when you go.</Text>

The guys at RPM really know their cars, especially Junior. He worked out a payment plan well within my budget for a vehicle that has now become my daily. Their inventory brought me in but Junior's knowledge and professionalism kept me there long enough to find the car I had dreamt about since high school. 5 star service, definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase a car or trade in!<//Text>

I'm in the market for a Tacoma. Junior booked my appointment last week and helped me with all my finance questions. I didn't buy the truck yet due to some extra bills I have but when the time is right I will be coming back to RPM and dealing with Junior. Best car buying experience .<//Text>

<review>I bought a Jeep Wrangler from them a few months ago and I am happy with the car . The service we got the first time was great and everyone was helpful , I had to drive there a few times from Palm Springs to re-do paper work and to drop off more forms that I need it. But there were a few things that had to be done to the car that took for ever to get fix . I called many times to speak to the manager and not once did the front desk girls trasfer me because he was always busy even tho I told her I was not happy with the service. ( they had messed up on our address and send a check to the wrong address).Finally I was able to schedule an appointment because their time didn't work with mine , I took it and one of the problems was not fixed and we had asked if the could change the oil and we would pay for it . I got a call that the car was ready but they couldn't do the oil change after driving the car it dosnt feel like the breaks were fixed either .  It very disappointing</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dcadebdd4fa80d:0x9b4fee47c037ee4e</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>The dealership has great cars. All of them have low miles. Customer service is great, they really take care of you from the time you walk in the door and even after I bought my car. they helped me out with some questions I had about my car. Normally you don't expect that from a used car dealership but I didn't have to fight them on anything. they actually got me a cheeper payment and better interest rate then I was getting at other places.< /Text>< Pictures>

would leave negative stars. any ways avoid this place. sold me junk car first day i had it had issues on the freeway with my family in the car. contacted them that night they did not get back to me till 2 days later even then was told i have to make an appointment
till now they still have not made me an appointment after they told me i could just bring it in no problem but that was before i signed papers . worst customer service plus they lie just to make a sale.

<Text>Riverside Premier Motors is an amazing dealership.

I love cars and I have lots of experience dealing with all facets of car ownership.
The things that I like about RPM are number one the huge inventory. I got the exact car that I was looking for a white S550 with a black interior. Number two the service was unprecedented and bi-lingual. I have many friends who have purchased cars at RPM and I have never heard a complaint. Actually all I have ever heard about this dealership are reasons why I should buy, service and get my car detailed at RPM. I don't even mind waiting around the dealership for whatever reason because the whole time I am in car heaven. Remember when your reading reviews car dealerships are one of those places where the clients think they have the right to throw a temper tantrum so take the bitter reviewers opinions with a grain of salt.<//Text>< Pics>

Autotrader gave me an offer for $23k, took the car in, and they offered me $18k with no excuses what so ever, they drove my car, and then put it up on  hoist and inspected from the bottom, and found nothing wrong, had no mechanical or visual problems,  but offered me $5k below what auto trader guaranteed. Auto trader should not send their customers there, its a complete waste of time. I sold my car to carmax for $23k a day later.

When you multiple the total price of the vehicle X the % which they said was at 9.9% the total price of the car should have been at roughly $30,772 making his payments at around $427. When I told him how come they are charging him almost $8k in % they guy said " well the bank is not going to do it for free" , simply the worst dealership I have ever been in.

This dealer was great, Jr helped me a lot, when other dealers couldnt make it happen, he did. He took his time to work with me and gave me a low, perfect payment i was looking for and the car i always wanted. If ur looking for a good deal and great car, contact Jr from RPM"<//review>

<review>After 6 months of being ripped off I am still dealing with Riverside Motors.. they sold me gap insurance and a GPS that I never needed that added almos 2000 on my loan that added almost 40 extra in my loan for 5 years.. back in 10/6 I confronted riverside motors and they owe me almost 2000.. that they from 10/6 owe me that they have not returned.. the DMV Has returned me a check for 256 and Riverside motors has not returned that money to me yet.. they mailed me the DMV papers but not the check the dmv sent... the finance manger Nick is a very dishonest person and the salesman that sold me the car told me that I have to have Gap insurance and this GPS device in order to sell the vehicle.. riverside motors claims that almost two weeks ago money has been in the mail.. I’ve been waiting a total of three months for this refund. Now.. I have filed suit against this place.. I will contact Better Business Burreru... I will not stop in this place... please be cautious of Riverside Motors...<//review>< UserId.>

There's a BUM name Frank that sold me a car that overheated same day after I pulled off their lot. We tested the car and not 3 minutes in he had to go back to the dealership he was busy. Turns out if we tested it out longer I would have found out it was a piece of Junk, can we say class action people?< /Text>

<rate>2</rate><text>Looking for a used mid size truck for my dad, & come across RPM (riverside premier motors). I submit a ticket letting them know I'm interested in their 2007 Chevy Colorado, wait all day assuming they're going to contact me at some point throughout the next day. Don't hear anything so i call the dealership & tell them I was wanting to come look at their 07 Colorado they had up for sale. Tony picks up the phone and ask me some basic questions, then proceeds to see when I could be down I let him know probably 5:00 or 6:00pm depending when i get off work.
End up getting down there right at 6:00 a salesman approaches me, I let him know I was looking for Tony. He tells me Tony took off around 5:00 & didn't tell anyone he had a potential customer coming by. Semi irritated I deal with the other salesman, he lets us check out the truck and test drive it only thing we see wrong with it is the center console is destroyed (loose & dented severely). Let the sales guy know & he assures us he will get it fixed & its not a big deal.
Go inside to get the misery/ paperwork started. we offered 10.5k for the truck with 1,000 down, end up going to 1,500 down. guy does all the dumb stuff (writes numbers down & scratches them out, acting as if hes getting the payments lower). comes back not where we want it. An older guy walks over with the paper acting like its not gonna happen and we need to pay 2,500 down (totals BS) for the bank to accept the loan. I would have walked there but my dad was in need of a truck so we stuck it out.
end up getting the truck for sales price at 12,000 & they bought my Dads Dodge Dakota off him for 750.00, I tell the older guy we're dealing with now we only want to do 1,500 down so i assume hes going to use the trade in value of the truck towards the down payment, while we pick up the remainder 1,750 (which is 250 more then we originally said).  Guy takes the 750 for the trade in off the principle balance instead of doing what he knew we wanted. Talk it over with my parents & they don't wanna pay 2,500. Guy says all he can do is a deferred payment for the 500 in two payments for 250 (complete scumbag sales tactic). Parents end up paying the full 2,500 & we're so much closer to being done with these two tools.
Final thing before we leave is addressing the broken center console (that easy fix). Older guy tells us he can't fix it & we can just glue a piece of fiber glass on the underside ............. (wanted to slap him at this point) Conversation goes on for 10 or 15 mins & I can tell hes not gonna do anything about it. I tell him to forget the repair & to understand why I'm upset. He plays dumb for 5 minuets then finally says "I get it, I understand". we get the last of the paperwork & leave.
I would not recommended this dealer to anyone. Go to Carmax if it's in your budget or buy a new Vehicle somewhere else, If you do decide to go here avoid Giovanni, Tony & the older guy (I'll update it with him name asap) like the PLAGUE.

PS: Tony calls me back the next day (after I already bought the truck) & ask when I will be up to look at the Chevy......<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<userid>100444486203543781753< /userid><Review>I called today regarding a Audi S4 they had for sale. car was priced for 20k and is value at 15K max. so i called to see if it was a typo or a reason why it was priced so high. Gentlemen picked up, didnt state his name as other dealers do. I asked if they still had the car, he said yes, i asked if the correct price is 20k, he said yes, so i simply asked why is it priced so high and its KBB is 15K, all he said is OK SIR and hung up on me. I tried calling back to speak to his manager and there is no answer. After searching the car is realized that its a 1 of 250 S4's. Reason im giving them a bad review is because the sale's man just hung up without even explaining why. If he explained why it was priced like that, then i would still be interested. Horrible first impression. If there customer service is like this good luck to anyone that goes there.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< pics>

<text>I had been shopping around online for awhile looking for a veloster, I find one online and it was at rpm so being really excited because I felt it met what I was looking for the next day I go down there and unfortunately it had been trasfered to a different dealership. Junior felt really bad and told me that he might have something that was more suited for me. Velosters are REALLY small inside and have very little trunk room and the particular one I had seen online had 65,000 miles on it(still a great car but it just wasn't for me, I have a three year old and a stroller really wouldn't even fit in the trunk) so junior walks me around and he takes me over to a 2014 Hyundai elantra, we get in and take it for a test drive and it ran AMAZINGLY, I could tell that the definitely are very selective in the cars they choose to have on their lot, the best part was that not only was it in perfect condition it also had plenty of room and only had 29,000 miles on it! So we get in the room to sign all the papers and me thinking credit was enough and that I wouldn't need a down payment (naive I know, but it was the first car that I had purchased for myself and had been to a few dealerships several months prior and them saying anything to get you in the door thought that I wouldn't need one) he tells me that without one my payments would be way out of my set price range. I'm sure that he could see the defeat on my face so he tells me, look lets talk it out, tell me your situation and lets see what we can do. So he made me a deal that I had 2 weeks to bring in my down payment, this guy literally knew how much I wanted the car and went above and beyond to help me get it. So not only did I walk out with a car that I fell in love with, junior helped set it up so that payments and down payment worked for me! When it comes time for a different car (which won't be for awhile cause my car is in perfect condition) or my husband needs a different car well definitely be going back to rpm!</text><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>107140145140062740038< /UserId.>< gmapID>

I would not recommend this place I was pre-approved for a car it was supposed to be a done deal just go up sign papers and pick the car up I live over an hour away I drove all the way there I get there and they had just sold the car that I was pre-approved for it was supposed to be done deal I was very upset very disappointed they didn't bother to call and say they had sold the car they just let me drive up there then after I find out that they had sold the car on my way home they call me to confirm my appointment to come get the car that was just sold this place is a joke</text>

Bought a car from here not even 4 months later I have suspension issues, some of the power functions dont work (telescopic steering wheel), had to replace the brakes right away including the rotors due to metal to metal contact, I dont think the tires were ever removed as the lug nuts were rusted on and worst of all electrical issues if im at a stop light my LCD Navigation screen will blink on and off as if its shorting out, the stereo is almost always in low power mode which it should only be in that mode when the stereo is on and car off not when the car is running meaning my alternator or battery is already on its way out, it barely wanted to start when stopped to fuel up and just before fueling when I parked and but my brake on and transmission into park I had a bunch more lights come on; Suspension,Brakes, the tire pressure isnt being monitored, ABS, and others I dont knkw what they are. Im already hearing a "cold start whine" (Alternator giving out). I thought their "mechanics" checked out the cars and made sure they're good. Getting rid of the car ASAP and never doing business with this Stealership again.<//Text>

We sat down did business, he was a true professional. Took his time to break down the contract and I walked away with my 2010 Mercedes C300 !!! Thank you Victor I can't wait to do business again.< /Text>

We bought a 2014 Jeep with 56k miles on it and less than 2,000 miles later the a.c. compressor went out. They're also so cheap and hard up for money that they can't honor the coupons that they advertise! Just your typical shady used car dealer.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Without a doubt, they have the cleanest and most reliable cars in the area. Used that are like new and give me GUARANTEE IN ALL. I have already bought 2 cars, and soon I'm going for the 3rd. Excellent customer service. They speak Spanish. THANK YOU RPM !! Recommended 100%.

First time at Laser Cliniqúe and it was nothing but amazing! The office atmosphere is relaxing and very inviting. Jenna is both knowledgeable and thorough, her training and bedside manner are impressive!  She walked me through every step of the IPL procedure and was extremely professional and personable! All staff members were beyond friendly and I would recommend this practice to everyone! I will 100% be going back!<//Text>

I had a wonderful experience here getting a diamond glow facial from Mia, it’s the best facial I’ve had! Mia was very sweet and patient. I appreciate how gentle and informative she was during the process of taking care of my face. Thank you for making me feel comfortable and taking your time, my face feels amazing and I can’t wait for my next one!

The Laser Clinique staff is all professional and friendly, Claire has helped me on multiple occasions and is very knowledgeable and kind.  The facility is also beautiful and clean! They take all the precautions to keep their patients safe during this time.<//Review>

<Review>I can’t say enough good things about my experience at Laser Cliniqúe! I had been interested in getting my lips done for years, but wanted to make sure I was going about it the right way. After tons and tons of research  Laser Cliniqúe was hands down the only option for me ! They were professionals in the truest sense of the word, walked me through the whole experience and made sure I was completely comfortable the entire time. They listened to all my wants, and concerns and honestly gave me the pout of my dreams ! I can’t wait to go back and get my lips done again, they’re the only ones I trust and I make sure everyone knows !</Review><time>1616729047987< /time>< gmap_id>

Before her I was strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. Prior to Jenna I wasn’t seeing results and I didn’t have a good experience with the nurse and to make everything worse she burned my legs and I had 100 plus cuts all over my legs. That was months ago and the marks are still on my legs. As soon as Jenna started doing my laser hair removal I noticed immediate results! Almost immediately I knew that Jenna knew what she was doing. She is so sweet and humble and is the most amazing nurse there!!! She listens to you and does what she needs to do for results. I could seriously go on an on about how amazing she is but I’m pretty sure everyone that sees her and works with her already knows. She is so amazing and I appreciate her so much! She needs a raise for being so amazing!!! Now that she does my hair removal I won’t be looking for a new spa. Thank you Jenna for your outstanding work !!!!< /Review></record>

Laser Clinique is beautiful in the inside and all the staff members were so welcoming and professional. I had the aesthetic nurse Jenna and she was extremely experienced, knowledgeable, and attentive to my skin goals. I highly recommend her, especially if you're a little nervous at first, she calmed any nerves that I had. I can't wait to go back!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>I called to make an appointment and asked what kind of accommodations they make (as required by LAW) for people with medical exemptions that cannot wear masks. I was happy to wait outside until my room was ready where I take off the mask anyways but I was told that they do not honor medical exemptions. This is discrimination. They cannot make policies that violate state and federal laws. Yes, they are privately owned but they are open to the public as a public accommodation and laws are enforced to protect human god given rights. Guidelines are not above the law. They are recommendations. And it’s sad that they are in the medical field and not aware of all the dangers associated with prolonged mask use. Masks do NOT stop or slow the spread of viruses. Masks are worn in the medical field to keep bacteria out of open wounds and that is ALL. And scientific data even proves that is up for debate. It’s a false sense of security that are making people more sick. I am disappointed to hear they discriminate as I was pleased with the Dr my last visit.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Started going to Laser Clinique for laser hair removal and facial treatments about 4 years ago, and have now added microneedling with PRP, Juvederm Volbella injections, and microblading into my repertoire. Each and every time I am met with superb quality of care and service!  The doctor, nurses, and practitioners explain the process, ask important questions to ensure that the requested treatment is right for me, and make it an enjoyable experience overall.  I also love how clean, hygienic, and modern the facility is.  They have taken all the necessary precautions during these COVID times to ensure that I have not been exposed to the virus that can carry into the facility and that all the staff within the facility are protecting themselves and all clients walking through the doors.  Made me feel super safe throughout it all.  Thank you, Laser Clinique, for all that you do and what you stand for - excellence!</text>

I have to say Dr. Ataii at Laser Clinique is UNMATCHED. With an artistic and gentle approach, Dr. Ataii treats EACH patient like an individual, not just another name on the schedule. After discussing some of my concerns with Dr. Ataii, we were able to find a good plan to matches my needs. I feel so beautiful, like myself again! I would definitely recommend Laser Clinique for any of your aesthetic needs.</review>

<Text>Such a nice experience visiting Laser Clinique! Everyone at the front desk was super helpful and friendly, and Olivia the woman who did the procedure was so nice and answered all my questions thoroughly and made sure I was comfortable. I would recommend this place to anyone who asked where I had my procedure done.</Text>< Time>

<Name>Tatu B< /Name><pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I absolutely LOVE this place!!! I've been coming here since Sep 2018 and my experiences only continue to get better. I used to have this misconception that laser hair removal was not within the means of my budget, but I was completely wrong. Not only do they make it affordable, but despite their VERY reasonable prices they make you feel "rich" every time you go there. The spa itself is immaculate and the staff/nurses are all so nice.

Speaking of the nurses, if you're lucky enough to get Joselyn to perform your treatments consider yourself blessed!! She is exponentially WONDERFUL!!! She's in very high demand and doesn't work there everyday. But, honestly, all of the nurses I've dealt with have been wonderful.... So whoever performs your treatments will give you a great experience.

I highly recommend this place!! 5 stars for sure!!< /Text><response>None< /response>< user>

The staff was courteous and skilled, the facility clean and comfortable. Dr. Atai was friendly, experienced, and very knowledgeable. Also, their prices are competitive. While I'm not a serial reviewer, Dr. Atai and his staff are deserving of my time and honesty. Personally, I've only had botox, but would like him to do a peel. However, a very close friend had laser facial treatments there prior to her wedding and was very pleased. The results were pretty impressive.
Yes, I would, without hesitation, recommend Laser Clinique to my family and friends looking for any cosmetic improvements.</Text>

Everyone is very polite, I was a little bit hesitant for my first appointment I never done anything cosmetic before. They all eased my nerves and even called me after my appointment to make sure everything turned out ok. The doctor was amazing, he joked around and had one on one conversations with me that made me feel comfortable, I have meet doctors before that are too serious and do not take the time to explain fully that was never the case with this clinic. I will definitely be going back.<//text>

<review>My daughter and I both get treated at the Laser cliniqúe.  I had a laser tattoo removal treatment and had the best experience.  The setting made you calm and relaxed.  The way staff talks you through each steps really helps. The pain did not even seem as bad as other treatments I've had in the past at other facilities. The hair removal process is equally as pleasant. My daughter and I highly recommend the Laser Cliniqúe for all your beauty needs.  It is very clean, comfortable and the staff is awesome! Very knowledgeable, patient and professional.< /review><GmapID>0x80dc07ae1d10c75b:0x95906cd92759b4a4<//GmapID></record>

Dr. Attaii is a true artist and uses superb aesthetic judgment to determine exactly what to do and when!  I have been getting various treatments from him for a decade now and I am more than delighted with the results.  I have done botox, juvederm, ultherapy, FX laser, and some laser hair removal, and people think I am 15 years younger than my passport says I am. The office is superb and well organized and the staff is always helpful.<//review>

< Review>
My friend referred me to Laser Clinique and I was impressed from the moment I walked in. The front office staff were very professional and helpful. Dr. Ataii has the best personality/bedside manner I have experienced in a very long time, especially in southern CA. He explained the procedure very well and had suggestions for other services I might be interested in based on my personal area(s) of concern. I will definitely be back!< /Review>

My fave place to get botox. Dr. Ataii is the BEST at what he does. I'm sure his other treatments are also great,  just haven't done anything else there.  Yet.  Lasers next.< /text>

They should be educated on the systems so they can be helpful to your customers and not just pretend they know what they are talking about and make the customer who is calling feel unsafe to come and use the treatments.</Review>< pictures>

I don't remember the name but I hope  staff know how important their role is in keeping his patients coming back.

<Name>Jessica Souza< /Name><time>1471560384868< /time><review>I went here based on the yelp reviews for my first ever appointment, with the thought in my mind that I would just try them out this first time and then perhaps try the several dr offices that also had great reviews that were closer to me. However, Dr. Ataii was super friendly and made me feel very comfortable. He was also very knowledgeable and willing to talk over all details and plans for the future. The staff was very welcoming and efficient. The waiting room was very comfortable even though I wasn't made to wait very long, which was very nice! So, even though the other places may be closer and also maybe just as nice, I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be returning!< /review>< Rating>

<Review>Another great experience here. Not only were they on time (at 3pm on a holiday week during a Botox special!) but once again, my experience with the doctor and everyone here was amazing.  I am referring anyone I know and plan to be back as soon as I can!  BONUS - I LOVE my look!

UPDATE:  Went in for some fillers and, once again, Dr. Ataii made a few recommendations, and totally updated my look!  My daughter was the first to comment. Nothing drastic, but I look fresh.  LOVE LASER CLINIQUE!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>My husband was so impressed with the results of my treatments with Dr. Ataii, it convinced him to see the doctor for his own skincare needs also. I ran out of face cream one day and saw that my husband had purchased Laser Clinique's green tea moisturizer which I ended up using and loved so much I replaced the one I'd been using for years!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I recently had my first visit to Laser Clinique, which was recommended to my by a good friend. It was a wonderful experience. Definitely worth the drive for me. Dr. Ataii is very attentive and great and answering questions. I did not feel that they were trying to sell me a bunch of unnecessary services. I went in for a specific treatment and that is what I got. So far so good. The price was fair. The staff was very helpful in setting up the appointment. Nice office.< /Review><Name>Siamak Ansar</Name>< Resp>

I love this place so much, I make a two hour drive to get to it. After searching for years to find a doctor that can take care of all my beauty needs, I finally found LC 3 years ago. They take care of my laser hair removal, botox, and scar removal all in one place. The staff is always so nice, and Dr. Ataii is patient in answering all my questions every time. He is highly skilled and makes all the work look so natural... I am so happy and grateful to him for my glowing skin!< /text>

Went here for my 1st time to receive laser hair removal - so far my ongoing treatment is going great, not that painful & seems to be effective, definitely seeing way less hair growing back in. Excellent customer service & follow up by their staff members. Enjoy coming here, very pleasant experience for me.< /Text>

Dr. Ataii is always very good about discussing the procedure, results expectations, what it will feel like and what it will cost.  I've had a few different kinds of treatments (most recently IPL) and each time have been pleased with the results and my experience at their clinic.<//text>

I was greeted by a very warm and welcoming front office staff that assisted me with all my questions and helped prep me for my treatments. Dr. Ataii was amazing he walked me through everything that he was doing before, during and after my treatment. He made me feel very comfortable and the results I have received are above and beyond what I expected! I will choose Laser clinique for all my skin care and beauty needs every time!

<Review>As soon as I walked through the doors of Laser Clinique I was greeted with genuine smiles not the artificial kind, but honest genuine smiles. The crew they have running that ship are very down to earth. My procedures were intense, but the atmosphere and the crew helped aide with any discomfort I may have had. My results thus far have surpassed my expectations. This is a real person who was searching for a bit of confidence. This truly is a great place to find that missing piece of confidence that we know we all need. Thank you Laser Clinique.<//Review>< Pictures>

It was my first time to have any kind of work done. I was very nervous. Dr. Ataii took the time to explain everything to me before and calmed my nerves. I am very very happy with the results. My daughter referred me to Dr. Ataii and we both are very happy with him. If you are thinking about getting a procedure talk to him first.<//text>

I came here years ago and was so happy with the results of my IPL treatment. I did go elsewhere, due to price, a year or so later. Huge mistake! Don't go anywhere else. It will not compare! I've since come back here and couldn't be happier with the customer service, quality of care, and results from my treatments. Don't think about it, just do it! :-)</Text>

<text>What can't I say about the later Clinique! The entire staff is proffessional, accommodating, and very knowledgeable. Unlike most medical spas these women at the front desk have your back! They allow your experience to be pleasant and they put up with any of my silly questions. Dr atti. Is fabulous! Great bedside manner which is incredibly hard to find! Dr atti not only performs beautiful work but is such a kind doctor and a true pioneer in his field. Check the front office the man won the best of allergen which is a huge deal! Without him and the entire staff at the laser Clinique I would be lost thankfully I'm found and I'm very happy with my results!</text></record>

<Text>I've been coming to Laser Clinique for the past few years and couldn't imagine going anywhere else. The office itself is beautiful and the staff is always welcoming. Dr. Ataii  has proven to be highly skilled, knowledgeable, professional, friendly and always willing to help you out whenever you have any sort of concern or need. If you're looking for the next place to have all of your skin care needs addressed and enhanced (and get amazing results), I would highly recommend Laser Clinique!<//Text>< Pics>

I love this place so much especially Dr. Ataii, I  drive  over 2 hours to get to it. After searching for years to find a doctor that can take care of all my beauty needs,  take care of my laser hair removal, botox, and filler  all in one place. The staff is always so nice, and Dr. Ataii is patient in answering all my questions every time. He is highly skilled and makes all the work look so natural... I am so happy and grateful to him for my glowing and firm skin.</Text>

Ummmm WOW. I have always wanted a nose job but was too scared to get rhinoplasty. I was always scared I would end up with one of those botched nightmares and end up with a nose that I hate more than the one I already have. First of all, Dr. Ataii is amazing. He is super friendly, funny and made me feel comfortable. I had gotten botox somewhere else in La Jolla where they charged me $750 for 50 units (I was 27 at the time and don't have wrinkles that bad). He barely said anything to me in my consultation or explained what he was doing. My face was frozen and the only muscles that worked were the ones on the sides so when I made expressions I had the creepy raised eyebrow botox look. Dr. Ataii really took the time to explain what he would do, what my options were and what amounts should be used in order to achieve the natural look I wanted. He also worked with my budget and let me know what my options were and made me feel comfortable about it. He also did my lips which look perfect. If you have bird lips like me, getting juviderm will be the best thing you have ever done for yourself. THANK YOU DR. ATAII!!!< /Text>

<review>Laser Clinique never disappoints.  Dr. Ataii is highly skilled and knowledgable, and offers personalized skin care for all skin types.  His knowledge and expertise are also reflected in the staff at Laser Clinique, who make me feel so comfortable at each visit and are highly educated on all of the non invasive cosmetic treatments offered.  When I arrive at Laser Clinique I am always welcomed like family and when I leave I look and feel amazing.  I highly recommend this facility.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Laser Clinique is the only place I refer my clients too. It's easy to schedule and the work is by far superior to any other. I feel confident as I age that I will be able to do it gracefully.

<Text>I did a lot of research before coming to Dr Ataii...because you cant just trust getting work done by anyone.  Needless to say, I'm ecstatic with the results.  Dr. Ataii is immaculate in his process.  He was very knowledgeable about the procedure, and he explained everything he was doing, as we went along, so that I knew exactly what he was doing, and why he was doing it.  It was nice to know that it was a very well thought out process, which made me feel completely at ease.  Im really scared of needles, but it was so pain free. They really numb the area well before, and as for the results, they're super natural, and i just look like an enhanced version of myself.  The healing process was minimal, i was off to work the next day, and none was the wiser.

As for the establishment...super clean, top of the line, and well kept

As for the staff...very attentive, you can tell they're BIG on CUSTOMER SERVICE, they have an amazing complimentary massage chair, and they followed up with me the very next day to make sure everything went smoothly, I couldn't be happier with my results!< /Text><rate>5< /rate>< pics>

The Dr. was not clear on how the IPL works. He recommend it for me. I had 3 sessions. I have olive skin and IPL's are not usually recommend for my skin type. I had great skin before just wanted a couple of sun spots removed now I have horrible melasma that the IPL brought out. I also have two scars on my face from it.< /text>

<Review>First rate!  I've seen Dr. Ataii here and there over the past 5 years for Botox and Juvederm filler and have ALWAYS had exactly the outcome I asked for:  to look natural and not like a Real Housewife.  The office is immaculate, they are on time for appointments (which is a bummer because I don't have time to sample any of the yummy treats and coffee) and they help you lower the cost of services by running specials and keeping track of $$ points from the products you receive.  Dr. Ataii is an honest guy who wants you to look and feel your best.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Excellent doctor and staff! Frequently go in for botox. Tried another doctor for botox who was a tad cheaper, and he hurt me as my eye could barely close and hurt for a solid week. I've never had a bad experience w/Laser Clinique. I love them and highly recommend!< /review>

I recently visited Laser Clinics as I normally do every several months. I am so happy with the result! I feel Dr. Ataii is the best in the in soft facial lift medical filed. He is so natural and the way he chooses the spot to inject is superb, which makes your experience so comfortable! Some other doctors can do a good job, but the the process is painful. Dr. Ataii also keeps up with the new products and technology which are so important to be competitive in this field, especially in San Diego area where there are so many good doctors. Ataii certainly proves that he is one of the best!!

I recommend all of you who have not visited Dr. Ataii to go and have the first hand experience!

The staff is friendly and natural. You don't see a forced smile. They all are genuine!< /Text>

First the doctor.......Dr. Ataii is a skilled and trained physician that specializes in skin care treatments.   He is completely dedicated to his patient's treatments and focuses on their own specific needs.  He is professional, knowledgeable, and has the most engaging and pleasant demeanor!

Second the office staff..... Whether it is a phone or in person encounter, patients are treated with the most welcoming demeanor - friendly, helpful, and completely knowledgeable!  The office staff and the way patients are treated are key, and they are a 5 star staff.

My treatments.... Dr. Ataii has given me botox, juverderm and age spot removal - all 100% successful for me!  I've always been extremely happy and satisfied with my skin care treatments.

All the reasons I have listed are the reasons I will continue to come to Laser Clinque and trust Dr. Ataii to all my skin care needs.  I will also continue to always recommend him -

I've had a few experiences with Laser Clinique which were all excellent and would recommend this clinic to anyone seeking a little "pick me up" or interested in anything they have to offer.

I've had experiences with;
laser hair removal, which was wonderful the staff made me feel comfortable and I had good results
botox- a little nerve racking at first but loved my results and far less painful then expected
juvederm- I wanted a little more volume in my lips, but not to look overstuffed or fake by any means. and it was right on target. loved it and am planning on going back for more when i need to!
and last but not least
Ultherapy- at first i thought it was all hocus pocus, but im a believer! i have seen amazing results in my neck and eyes! I was nervous about all those reviews that tell me it hurts, horrible pain ect, but that was not my experience with this clinic at all! their main concern was my comfort level and did what they could to make sure i wasnt in any pain! it was fantastic!< /Review>

This place helped restore my faith in automotive professionals (which I am usually skeptical of) with an honest diagnostic of my rim and quick tire service.  Additionally, everyone was pleasant and real.  If I blow another tire in the SGV, I'm coming back here.<//Review>

Good prices, fast workers, and great customer service. I went there and told them everything I needed and they got me on the right track for what I wanted to do. If you feel a little intimidated don't worry just fully explain what you want and they'll get you on your way. Shout out to the homie for coming to the restaurant! ✌< /review>

This place is rip off with their side buisness. They sold a car to my sister and when she went to pay for the tags, she was told by DMV  that she owed over $800 for the tags, this was after being told they had put non operational  Can't imagine what else they rip you off.<//review>

Bad experience with this rim repair company, took my 24" rim to have it repaired and painted, was recommended by a very reputable tire shop. They had my rim for a month, they gave me the run around, didn't paint it the right color, it had to be sent back and repainted came back and still wrong color and they still had the odasity to charge me, never going back or ever recommending anybody to this shop, very dissatisfied and disappointed!!!!!!!!!!< /text>

(Translated by Google) I will never go back again why because there is a worker called Mando he is the owners son. I installed a new set of rims on my dodge dart on March 21 2018 and imidiatley after leaving on whole wheel came off in the street it messed up my original screw holes and im very dissapointed he is not a "professional".

SPANISH

Customers do not buy in this place after what happened to me. Today March 21 2018 I bought a set of new wheels with tires and the boy named MANDO installed them and I only left the tayer and I got a wheel with all the tires and von the screws do not buy in this place they are not professional. I hope and they serve my advice so that they do not have the same

My all time favorite salads! The beets and greens is hands down my all time favorite salad! I dream of them opening a location in the east Bay! Their soups and grilled cheeses are also so good.</text>

Salads are delicious. Seating is limited (because it's a small place) Definitely worth stopping if you are in the area and want a fresh salad!< /Text>

Great, healthy salads and the grilled chicken burger rooster style is terrific. The location across the street might be preferable though if you're looking for more space and more options.< /text>

<text>Food is always great here & the decor is welcoming. However the woman that rang me up was extremely rude for literally no reason. She was short & not welcoming to the people in front of me in line. And when it came for my time to order she was clearly frustrated with whatever she had going on in her life. Slammed the receipt & pen for me to sign. I've worked in customer service since I was 16. Completely unprofessional.</text>< Pictures>

Great salads, but ridiculously SF premium price and slow service brings down the rating.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) From Home! The best hamburger ever eaten! Good and light at the same time. Prices more than fair being in SF

(Original)
Superconsigliato! L'hamburger migliore mai mangiato! Buono e leggero allo stesso tempo. Prezzi più che onesti essendo a SF<//Text><gmap_id>0x808580d72708c65d:0x9e3525f91bc8039b<//gmap_id>< Date>

(Translated by Google) Actually we wanted to go somewhere else, because it was full there we ended up here. So lucky. Very, very tasty salads, great dressings. The burger was good too. BedienungNice service! Around the corner there is the restaurant with more seats.
Very bustling, cool corner of San Francisco.

(Original)
Eigentlich wollten wir woanders hin, da es dort voll war landeten wir hier. Was ein Glück. Sehr, sehr leckere Salate, tolle Dressings. Der Burger war auch gut. 😋Nette Bedienung! Um die Ecke gibt es das Lokal noch einmal mit deutlich mehr Sitzplätzen.
Sehr trubelige, coole Ecke San Franciscos.<//Text>

<text>This is a good place to get groceries. It is not like a regular Walmart. More of a supermarket feel. Can have a few moments of people getting a little ghetto. But the staff handles it well. They have a great staff

Seriously ... whose bright idea was it to build a Walmart with only two cash registers? The self checkout lanes are no better. Lines are always so long. God help you if you need liquor or toiletries as many of the items are locked. You push a button for a sales associate to open the case for you and it takes them forever to get there. That is if they even bother to show up at all. A good place to shop if you have all the time in the world. Otherwise, I suggest you shop elsewhere.</Review>

<Review>I like this store for groceries. Its closer to my house than the super walmart is so when I just need to pick up items like food and cleaning supplies, I choose to go there. It always seems to be really busy. But even when the line is long, their self checkout is pretty quick.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x809ad97f430d01db:0xd0a7b7b4b8d17393<//gmapID></record>

Stepped up with keeping shelves stocked. Frequently the public restrooms are up to clean standards. A few months back they added more self-checkout stations. So the cashier power was reduced...creating long lines at those registers. All and all a good place to shop. If you like to be RIPPED OFF BY SAM WALTON AND COMPANY!!!< /text>

Low stock, small choice of wat brand, and the women's shoes are very ugly, not a big selection, never my size which is eight and half. Then the woman's clothing section needs improvement. Cuter choice of clothing for plus size women..........and then there is checkout and check cashing sigh......it takes forever< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>Usually over crowded since there aren't many grocery stores in the area. Or possibly, its the lower prices that draw in the crowds. Either way, be ready to wait in a long line.

Its the lines that get me. I waste more time waiting in line than I do the shopping. Whether that is self check out or someone ringing me out. Usually I'm in and out and only need a few things, but I wait at least 10 or more minutes. either a machine is down or they have 2 cashiers.</Text>

<Review>Nice employees and helpful. So cool inside I could shop and breathe. Thank you. Line's way too long to check out 6-9 people in line each lane 1 checker. Not enough. Plenty on the floor to stock not enough at check out to help. Had to run back to get another item due to the sku number incomplete. Line waited etc. Sad. Other wise great! Clean also except bathroom.< /Review>< Pictures>

Was in line for over a half hour- must have been at least 30 people in line for the customer service desk. They only had one lady working the counter but numerous other employee's were just bee- boppin' around with seemingly nothing to do- ya think one of them would have come and helped that poor woman all by herself at the customer service desk. Will nev
er go again if I can help it.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I am writing to commend the amazing customer service provided by the store manager at Walmart on Marconi. I work for an organization that supports people with disabilities and was informed that when one of our clients was there recently, they found themselves in the unfortunate circumstance of not having the funds to fully pay for their purchase.  The manager of the store paid for the purchaser out of his own pocket much to the surprise and delight of the customer. I would like to personally thank and commend the management of Walmart for their outstanding  customer service.</review>< pics>

Maybe it’s just me but every time I’m in this place it’s jam packed. Lines for the few checkout clerks halfway down the isles and lines wrapped around the side for the customer service station. Every trip there is a minimum 30-45 min just waiting in line.</review>

Hard to find help, but usually stocked and I can find what I need. I was waiting for over 30 minutes for an associate to assist me, with four other people waiting at the same place as I. Went to three different people before I had to interrupt someone helping someone else to get what I needed.<//Text>

< Review>
The pharmacy is what keeps me coming back the service from employees mainly thier checkers is absolutely awful
Last night was my last stop I had a fad a fabulous day
The checker was the rudest by far i have experienced at this location and she was in the management team.
Very desturbing.
I do multiple shopping for our Seniors. Duly note my business will not be at this Walmart Neighborhood Market on Marconi.
All the Walmart stories heard about Customers
Everyone has one
The Service recieved shouldn't be the source. Bad service should be fired so they really can be rude.</Review>

There staff is always friendly and helpful, Kermit is such a sweetheart  he went in the back and got me disinfectant  wipes being 8 35 weeks pregnant  and nesting like crazy ot ment alot to me his going out his way. His manager is even nicer the woman I spoke to to tell her about my experience  was genuinely happy to hear the feed back and when I came in to pick up an online order insisted on helping me load all of it to my car!</text>

<Text>The Wal-Mart on Marconi near Howl avenue  is a no-frills store. I've been going to this Wal-Mart for 10 years or more. On occasion I've shopped at Safeway and Raileys stores and was blown away at how different and nice they looked compared to my ol" Wal-Mart. Don't get me wrong! I like different and nice as much as the next shopper. But I've worked so hard to know where every item I could possibly want or need is. I even look forward to saving some other shoppers day by telling them exactly where what their looking for is. I still catch myself visiting they're competitors stores from time to time.</Text>< Pictures>

Great go-to for groceries, but there are limited  checkstands and the self checkout stations are faulty. Prepare to spend 10-minutes checking out once you have found what you are looking for.< /Review>

<Review>It's the closest to my home. Shelves are never fully stocked. My favorite checkout lady has got a job at this one. She's the only one I allow to check me out. She's friendly and very responsible in what should be packed together. Love her and she's the best thing about this store. Please stock your shelves fully.<//Review>< pics>

If you like to do most of your monthly shopping though I would suggest a different Walmart Grocery location with a bigger store, but its great if you forgot that little something for dinner.< /review>< pics>

Everything is locked up, so you constantly need to ask for help to get items. The employees are nice, but that's about the only good thing that I can say. The only reason that I have recently been there is to pick up a medication from the pharmacy. And even that was an adventure.</review><pics>None<//pics><user>113572424133041208137< /user><user_name>Melissa Kennedy<//user_name>< rate>

Not one said anything to me, no "hello, we will be right with you", each of them looked at me, saw me standing, obviously needing service, and completely ignored me. No customer service what so ever. Worst Walmart, and thats saying something.  Will NOT shop at Walmart ever again</Text>< response>

<review>The first thing that I noticed was the automatic gate that is installed at the entrance, it only opens one way so I soon gathered that it was to prevent people from exiting in that direction. I brought my friend here to find a couple of items and was disturbed by what I can best describe as a prison atmosphere. The gate that opens one way, the excessively large monitor hovering above the checkout area that surveys the entire store, and the men guarding the check out area and exit. It is not welcoming at all, and I would not recommend this particular store for the reasons that I shared.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

They have some employees that have very questionable affiliations!! There customer service people are unfriendly, rude, and falsify (yes lie ) information to their customers- out and out lie actually !! To impose hardships on their customers , oh I should mention these employees are involved in espionage on the U.S. Government (yes spying- up in peoples homes with surveillance & committ other acts of terrorism as well !!)</text>

<text>Do I really have to tell you it's great? But, I'm kinda over the not so subtle price increases. As if we have a say over their tactics. They got us by the shorties!</text>< pictures>

<text>The customer service line is regularly backed up and around in front of the pharmacy. Ive been in the line for 25 minutes and no one is clued into the customer service element that is absent from this line. Not sure why the reps at the counter have no idea how to expeditiously conduct business for the sake the customer service line.</text>< pictures>

Convenient , close to home , but  self checkout is the way to go under a certain amount of groceries. Seems prices are lower , maybe obsevation. Not as stock as supercenter walmart but has mostly what I need.< /review>

3.o stars...If not for the long check out lanes, getting assistance out on the floor due to several items listed on shelves at one price but skd tag at another(higher)price.It would give the rating 3.5 or almost a 4.0 The customer service of those who came to help when they did show up it made all the difference in how frustrated i was.. #1store leaders need to make sure products on shelves match the price on the shelves and is in the right spot. #2continue to be friendly,curtious,and timley when a customer needs help on floor.The attitudes and their smiles make a big difference.#3Get customer service counter more efficient.Once you reach the cashier its quick.Its getting to the cashier that is "BAD."Spending 20-30min in line is crazy<//review>

I go here all the time cuz they shut down the one closest to me. The money center line is almost always at least a half hour wait. Everything else is decent, if your using self checkout it is suprisingky fast believe it or not. Will be back but if there was one closer I'd go there, this one is used only out of necessity<//text>

<text>I shop here once or twice a month. Store is usually well stocked but been there a few times that it wasn't. Could use a couple more mobility scooters ASAP. Men's bathroom could use a bit more attention and one of the sinks needs fixing. I need to use  one of those scooters  from time to time too. I have found the employees to be very friendly and helpful in finding items or getting the right price of something. I appreciate the employees personal attention they give to me even when they're busy.

<Text>They definitely don't have the selection of a Super Walmart, as expected. The produce is under par most of the time. The stockers were everywhere with pallets, uboats and carts at peak evening hours today...Friday. A stocker walked by one of the cash registers and said, "alcohol and drugs ruined my life"...that was pretty odd.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This store is a smaller size of the bigger Wal-Marts. Its mostly a grocery store with some non food items included. Give it a try you may like it.<//Review>

Wouldn't cash my money order, waited in line 25 minutes for them to deny me. Because I had proof of where the money order came from and the date of purchase and the former purchase. Now if I did not have that how would the situation would have went?<//Text>

Never again! I'd tell you what is wrong but dont have that much patience to go into detail. You would think it would be cleaner, faster, better selection as they are competing with 4 other grocery stores within walking distance but bad.... REALLY BAD!< /text>

Way too many employees with carts filling up the shelves they block the aisles, check stands are full you have to wait in line too long definitely not a good experience. I will not be coming back their prices are not any better for better quality food at other stores like Safeway< /text>

< Review>
The staff does its best to provide good shopping experience,  but this location has obstacles in this area. High theft,and the lines are long as Walmart appears to be phasing out real people to check out groceries and push self checkout. Because of the abundance of people shopping here, they frequently are out of stock of many basic items and or have large pallets of food on the sales floor being restocked or moving from one area to another. I try to avoid this location as much as possible. Clearly not the employees doing but a Corporate issue within Walmart that needs to be reassessed.<//Review>

<text>Worst Walmart ever.. people fighting in the parking lot, people asking you to buy their food stamps inside the store, never any carts or hand baskets, bare shelves most of the time.. They're always out of essentials & I'm always left wishing I went to the winco down the road.. don't waste your time or money..<//text>< pictures>

Getting better, healthier choices and products in, thank you for that.... but so much of the shelves are empty! Why? I wish the employees were more friendly. This is the least friendly cashier bunch I've ever encountered. 😟< /Review>

Shoppers do not maintain safe distance,  and no Walmart recordings to warn customers,  and certain disreputable  types get upset when you ask them  to maintain  6 feet appart, and respect your personal space.<//review>

Always slow only one line open. Asked staff to open another register and she said I'm working self serve and did it tell anyone.  Also shelves empty a lot and pallets of product in aisles.  They should stock at night and not on a busy day.<//review>

< Review>
Why are so many products locked up these days? I wanted a diabetic related item, but had to track down an employee, who had to go get the key to unlock the case. Once the items were removed, I was told they would be held at a certain register until I was ready to check out. The check out area is a nightmare. There are two registers to the lane where my items were, one self check out, one regular, but there isn't enough room to pass the first one to get to the second one, especially if you're in an electric cart, like I was. You can't even tell which register the people are waiting for. While I was driving around, looking for a way to get to the register where my items were, a nice employee offered to help me, but even that got confusing as to where she wanted me to go, and how to get there. In all the confusion, I had to leave my 92 year old aunt (whom I was supposed to be helping) in her line, so I could purchase my items at a different register. Too much hassle. Don't plan on returning any time soon.< /Review>

< Review>
I shop here twice a month or more. The price is reasonable, but there is usually a wait for the lines for both self checkout and regular checkout. Customer service line is extremely long if you go during the afternoon. Some items I’m not able to return because I purchased it in a regular Walmart store and they don’t carry the item. I would have to visit the Walmart elsewhere. This place is small, but you get what you need in the store.
You have to call someone to get the cosmetic for you since it is locked. I don’t think the button next to the cosmetic works at all. I pressed more than five times and no one comes to grab the item. The employees are usually busy with other customer and take a long time to come and grab the cosmetics. Also after the employee grabs the item, they put it in the register. You will get your item when you checkout.</Review>

This location needs a serious renovation.
Never enough staff.Long lines to checkout.Shelves are never stocked.Its called SUPPLY AND DEMAND ! Heavy customer traffic(demand) yet they cannot keep the products available.
Customer service area always has a very long line.Only 1 employee ???? Why ??
From peak time "10am -8 pm
two employee's is absoutley necessary.
Save yourself a headache.....do not visit this location.< /Text>

It's nice to be able to get things at Walmart prices. However , the disgusting cigarette smoke that comes in while waiting in line is horrible. The store could be a little cleaner. The employees are almost ALWAYS yelling from across the store talking about how drunk or high they got the night before. Most of the cashiers are super nice and very patient. I appreciate that.<//Review>

<Review>I bought something online. It didn't worl. I took it today and the staff is not trained well to handle a simple task as putting store credit on a gift card. I was there 40 minutes 2 leads or in charge people later and still could not figure it out. I was told to go to a Supercenter to get it returned. I am disabled and when I was able to purchase onlineband pick up at my neighborhood Walmart I was happy. Its hard for me to get around. Left there really disappointed.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

This used to be a neighborhood store  before the store on El Camino closed. The store was not built nor are item's stocked for the amount of traffic that shops there. Its either a hit or miss experience with this store.  Sometimes items are stocked that I  need, most times not, sometimes handicapped parking is available most times not. I try to avoid shopping there like a plague and before I do, I pray and hope. The employees do the best they can while working under staffed, its not their fault for the long wait in line.</text>

I was hoping this would save me a drive to Safeway but it won't. Very poor selection of produce and a worse selection of wine. A fair selection of meats and poultry. The employees were very friendly and helpful. There is just not enough selection of items we use to shop here.<//review>

<Review>Omg... this place is the worst.  Every "the people of Walmart" meme you've ever seen is brought to reality here.  The checkers are rude and the producer is sub par.  I definitely would not gamble on the meat products here either.  The milk is gross, like it was allowed to get too warm.  The prices are good, but only at great cost to quality and environment and customer service.  I am definitely not a fan.</Review>< pics>

<review>Interesting...all went good while shopping went well.  Lady behind me was very rude and pushy...putting her items on the belt before I could empty my basket ..push her basket into me before I cod get out of her way.  The store was extremely busy..while existing the line trying not to bump in to other customers the woman was hitting my heels with her basket...not once excusing her actions...I was talking to a couple of your cashiers about how rude she was...it was completely unnecessary to do that to a senior citizen...I am in my 70's she looked like maybe in her mid 50's...other than that you have a ver nice store and great employees....</review>< pictures>

DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!!!! I was at register 1 last night around 1045ish and I ASSUME that there was a loss prevention staff that wanted to accuse publicly a customer that was behind me with her basket of stealing.  this sorry employee was so loud and disrespectful that he blocked my movement from putting my food on the conveyor belt and walking up to pay for my items!!! he was so disgusting that he was yelling at the top of his voice accusing the woman of stealing and HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK ME TO JOIN IN SHAMING THIS WOMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT GOT WORSE WHERE HE ATTEMPTED TO BLOCK HER FROM LEAVING WHICH IN TURN BLOCKED OTHER CUSTOMERS FROM LEAVING THE STORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE LATER DECIDED TO ALLOW AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS TO ASK THEM TO CONTINUE TO SHAME THIS WOMAN FROM STEALING!!!!!!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO LOSS PREVENTION QUIETLY ASKING A PERSON ACCUSED TO COME WITH THEM????? THIS IDIOT BLOCKED THE EXIT SO MUCH UNTIL I WENT THROUGH THE ENTER DOOR!!!! OTHER CUSTOMERS STOPPED AND WAS WATCHING THIS DEBACLE!!!!!! I WILL NEVER EVER EVER SHOP WITH WALMART AGAIN!!!!!! OH AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, I JUST SPOKE TO THE MANAGER, SHE STATED THAT SHE WILL LET THE STORE MANAGER KNOW HOWEVER SHE DID NOT ASK FOR MY CONTACT INFORMATION, NOTHING TO COMPENSATE FOR MY EXPERIENCE AT THIS LOCATION.  THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED?!???< /Review>

<review>Waited for assistance with a locked cell phone charger display almost 25 minutes. This was after asking two different supervisors for help. Then spent another ten minutes to check out. We actually could use a larger neighborhood Walmart, this location often runs out of items. It's convenient but customer service gets two stars, but hey... it's Walmart!
The store has the basic supermarket amenities. Not much for speed of service... the parking lot is well lit, and they do have a small customer service counter.</review><resp>None</resp><rating>3< /rating>< pics>

Brought a kombucha drink from here. It expires 4.27. Yet it taste like it is already expired. Manager said other people need to come in with the same complaint for him to take action. Basically others need to get sick first. I hope I never need to come here again. Sad place to shop. Fruit selection always is bare and beat up.</Text>

<Text>Shelves are never stocked properly. Has gone from being a decent place to pick up groceries to my least favorite place to go.  They have some very helpful employees but also have some employees that need lessons in customer service.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Interesting...all went good while shopping went well.  Lady behind me was very rude and pushy...putting her items on the belt before I could empty my basket ..push her basket into me before I cod get out of her way.  The store was extremely busy..while existing the line trying not to bump in to other customers the woman was hitting my heels with her basket...not once excusing her actions...I was talking to a couple of your cashiers about how rude she was...it was completely unnecessary to do that to a senior citizen...I am in my 70's she looked like maybe in her mid 50's...other than that you have a ver nice store and great employees....<//text>

<review>Very small store, limited items, employees restocking always in your way, opens only one or two registers, long lines, parking lot is dirty. Grocery carts very dirty and full of germs. However prices are good.<//review>< UserId.>

Fast in and out if you self-check, but if you don't, or if you have beer or wine, California makes it illegal to self-check.  Funny thing -- hard liquor has its own checkout off away from the other checkouts.< /Review>< Pics>

I went to the Walmart Neighborhood Market because the Walmart I usually go to was closed permanently. I like the flavored water brand that Walmart carries. Specifically the Fuji Apple flavor. On the day I went there weren't any of the Fuji Apple flavor. In addition the twelve packs of strawberry flavor were also not on the shelves. It was a disappointment.< /Text>

This "neighborhood Walmart" is nice and convenient especially for quick in and out matters. There's not a lot of traffic here compared to the "Super Walmart's", naturally there's way more to choose from, but it's nice to be able to quickly go into a grocery store and get out and on your way. Also there's a strip mall right across the street with Ross, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Trader Joe's, and more!</Review>

<text>I went to the Walmart Neighborhood Market because the Walmart I usually go to was closed permanently. I like the flavored water brand that Walmart carries. Specifically the Fuji Apple flavor. On the day I went there weren't any of the Fuji Apple flavor. In addition the twelve packs of strawberry flavor were also not on the shelves. It was a disappointment.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>One cashier for a line that spread back to the freezer isle.  Their solution was pulling people from said line over to the self checkstands. I was quite offended by the stockers using foul language with children clearly in the immediate area.  Repeated foul language...discusting.   One stocker made it clear to me with heavy sigh and body language that I annoyed him trying to go into the isle he was working on.<//Text>< rating>

<Text>Today I was in the neighborhood market on Marconi Ave. One of the employees signaled to another employee pointing at me as to say keep your eyes on that guy. Like I was going to steal something. That kind of thing has happened before in the same store. I know people do steal from that store, because I've seen them do it. But I'm not a thief, and there isn't anything that I have to steal. It's very insulting. I guess I'll have to let him, the employee, know the next time I'm in that store that I'm not the thief he obviously assumes that I am. Not all black people are criminals and thieves.<//Text><response>None< /response>< rate>

<review>Why do I always see them stoking the shelves but every single time they are always out of 90% of what I want. They are always way too busey with lines going to the back of the store and half the time I can't even get to what I want to becsuse They have their box's in the way. Also half the store is locked up and the last thing I want to do is ask some guy to unlock the case so I can get my feminine wipes<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This walmart is one of the places that i hate most. I shopped here for almost 2 hours and when i was checking out the guy cashier rang me up and i told him to split my transactions coz i have coupons. Ended up calling a CSM which this  Customer service leader came up and doesnt wanna override the coupons i totally understand. So they cancelled the whole transaction and we had to begin again but when she was ringing me up you can tell she hated coupons the way shes slowly ringing up 1 by 1. Very slow.. i told her nicely maam i dont have enough time coz ive been here pretty much 3 hrs already.

This is an awesome Walmart neighborhood Market. It's got everything you need from a grocery store and easy to find everything you need.  The pharmacy is quick and friendly. I love this store.< /text>

This walmart is one of the places that i hate most. I shopped here for almost 2 hours and when i was checking out the guy cashier rang me up and i told him to split my transactions coz i have coupons. Ended up calling a CSM which this  Customer service leader came up and doesnt wanna override the coupons i totally understand. So they cancelled the whole transaction and we had to begin again but when she was ringing me up you can tell she hated coupons the way shes slowly ringing up 1 by 1. Very slow.. i told her nicely maam i dont have enough time coz ive been here pretty much 3 hrs already. She just suddenly cancelled the transaction and it was embarrassing coz i was there already quite long. I asked them to call the manager and this other guy kept telling me that she was the manager but shes not coz it says on her name tag customer service leader. Obviously they dont want to call the manager, the feeling when i left here is not right i cried coz of humiliation. I was couponing for food and ended up going home wd none. I hope this wouldn't happen to anyone. The Cs leader here is a RACIST! Very rude and very not appropriate. Hate this place everytime i drove by it i can feel the same feeling i had that day.</Review>

I like this place. It's not that everything is great nor that everything is super cheap, but they have some things here that are really really good. And in many cases prices that are really hard to beat. Plus it's fast -- easy to get into -- easy to get out of.< /Text>

I usually go to this store first thing in the morning because I don't like crowds. I realize not everyone can do that, but early morning...staff is always friendly and busy. Today though, I had to go here around noon to get some stamps, and it was crazy packed. Anyway, I was waiting in customer service when I observed a customer berating and speaking abusively to an employee because she had to wait in line.😑 The employee continued to respond professionally and with class, even after the threats. Please tell me Sharon is getting paid more than minimum wage. My 5 star is because she handled the situation better than I think most would. Keep it up Sharon.< /review>

The store is a mess, they almost never have any carts near the doors and you have to go into the parking lot to get one. The cashier's are slow and there's usually only two cashier's open so the lines back up down the isles. Even self check out. If at all possible stay away from this store!!!<//review>

Horrible everytime. Workers are so slow moving they show they don't care. 3 employees in the parking lot and one in her car on break while the only 2 registers are having back to back issues with pricing and customers. They need quicker moving employees who actually want to help.< /review>

WalMart closed up in my area. Mad up all upset in myneighborhood. We started going to WalMart neighborhood store. It is over crowded in parking and in the store. Stocking is dont during the day and only one person doing it. Cant find what you are looking for. Disappointed!!! Bring back our WalMart.< /text>

<Review>This Walmart Store is for grocery only. Very slow lines at register. It look 30 minutes to get to the register, with only three people in front of me. All the registers were open, but all of them were going very slow. Customer service on sales floor was excellent, as prices are very good. Store was clean. Parking lot was problamatic with security that seems oblivious to happenings in the parking lot.< /Review>< Name>

< Review>
Worst "neighborhood" market in town. Bathrooms are either filled with junkies locked in a stall for hours or "closed" constantly. EVERY customer is treated like a criminal. Had security "notified" about me scanning green onions at self check out. Got yelled at for using the barcode, even though there was NO plu to enter. Highly disappointed in this walmart.<//Review>

It is what you should always expect from a Walmart. Small Isles, only two workers on the floor walking around and dont know where anything is. The customer clientele is of course ghetto as Hell. Typical Wal-Mart experience.<//Text>

Tired of the pharmacists pushing vaccines on me. They lied and said their registry said I didn't have a tetanus shot when in fact, I got one in 2013. Those shots are good for 10 years. Second, I'm pregnant and told the pharmacist I was pregnant and he didn't seem to care that I didn't want a flu vaccine.
My choice, my body. Stop trying to kill more ppl, wal mart. You already overwork those poor ppl in the sweatshops!<//review>

<Review>I go to the neighborhood store because of the prices.  But it seems everytime I go there  is something I want that the shelves are empty.  Last night it was regular Hormel chili and Tyson 4.4lb frozen chicken nuggets.
The nuggets are normally not in the freezer and I normally buy a brand I don't prefer. Last nite I was ticked and came home without nuggets (and only one can of turkey chili). They had lots of hotttt chili.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Was good. Way overcrowded, not well stocked all the time now ever since The El Camino and Watt store closed. If you're Disabled and need the eleslctric shopping cart, good luck. They only have one.</text>

I stopped going here over a year ago.  Was driving by and needed a few things. Even worse than it was. Literally empty shelves at 9:00 on a Saturday morning. Now they have some items locked up just to make it even more ghetto</text>

I never come here cause we grocery shop at winco BUT I needed a box of gloves for my caregiving job . One item . I did self checkout and thanked the self checkout Walmart lady for her help , she saw me make my perchase. On my way out the guy stopped me of all people to check my receipt. I asked him “you really going to check my receipt for a box of gloves?” He said yeah . When I got my receipt back I left , and with an attitude he told me bye . Rude and unprofessional.<//review>

<review>I gave this store 3 stars because it doesn't carry as many of the items I was use to buying at the Watt Ave & El Camino Ave location before they closed it. They stopped carrying my favorite UV Brand Blue Raspberry Flavored Vodka at this location & they don't always have my favorite 98 cents bag of 3 White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut Cookies, my favorite red colored Hawaiian Punch Fruit Punch flavored drink, my favorite Gouda Cheddar mix Cheese or my Mike's Hard Lemonade Black Cherry. The staff is nicer & more knowledgeable & helpful here than the North Highlands location as well. I miss the El Camino Ave staff's friendliness cashiers, customer service, stock clerks & pharmacy staff. However the stock clerk Paul, all of the pharmacy staff & Dave/David and Wayne both awesome & knowledgeable older gentlemen cashiers are all the wonderful employees at this Fulton & Marconi Neighborhood Market location, but the managers are not as knowledgeable as those staff members I mentioned. I don't like the discusting cigarette smoke smell when I walk into the store, am waiting in line or walk out of the store.<//review>< Pictures>

The service the last 2 hrs of operation are terrible, almost no carts available because the staff uses them for stocking the few employees there at night are pretty rude across the board and the cashiers can be very rude without any provocation. All in all if I didn't get off work so late I would never shop at this location.</Text>

HORRIBLE employees!!! Store aisles are a hazardous maze of abandoned carts (by both customers and employees), rolling 2-level ladders, stepladders, and other obstacles. Employees couldn't care less! I took pics of all the mess, which I will be sending to the corporate office along with a LONG letter of complaint. If I could give this store a negative rating, I would.<//text>

This place is getting worst now that the store on El Camino Ave & Watt Ave is close, more people less cash registers even at the tiny customer service , they better think to move across the street to where Save Mart used to be...
EDITED 06/24/20 , store is trying hard to keep  stocking regularly and they added more self checkouts, it's improving,  hopefully they'll maintain that.<//review>

<Response>None< /Response><review>It’s just not Walmart Store 5230!!! It is missed in the neighborhood. Every time I’ve been to the Neighborhood Market, the selection wasn’t great, like they can’t keep the shelves stocked. But it’s Walmart product and price, and you know what to expect. It’s just a much smaller scale with some depts having minimal items. Will go back because I don’t want to drive all the way up Watt Ave!< /review>< Date>

Disrespectful  Employees, Walmart should train Employees appropriately, and inform them that certain things can lead to a store being shut down. I called in to bring something to the stores attention. I was then treated as if i was lying. I don't care about the money. Now I will be going to the FDA. ILL ADD SOME PHOTOS OF COCKROACHES ON MY rotisserie chicken. Ill stick to Safeway or Railys. 🤢🤢🤢<//Text>

Terrible place. The parking lot is filthy, the store is crowded and the lines are long. Its ALWAYS like this. I've been to other Walmart Neighborhood Markets and they are not bad like this one.<//Text>

Selection is not as varied as Raley's, Safeway or Winco's. Prices are cheaper than Raley's and Safeway prices and comparable with Winco's prices. There is some organic food but not as selective and varied as Raley's and Safeway while Winco's has no organic food.<//review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I have top agree with a  lot of the reviews.  This store always has empty shelves. I usually don't shop here more than twice a month with my EBT. It never fails every time I've gone there in the last 3 months there's always they are lot of on my shopping list.  Very disappointed as I love the savings catcher of Wal-Mart and the other benefits of shopping at Wal-Mart. It's convenient for me so I'll be back.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

It's ok because that specific Walmart wasn't ALL THAT.... lol.

It's smaller than the other Walmarts I've been to and plus they have NO electronics and no home supplies there such as coffee makers and blenders.

Overall.... That Walmart kinda sucks</Text>

I live close by, but I rather go to Winco because they never re stock items on shelves, they never have baskets when I go, and they barely have bags, the carts are hard to push, they don't stock their produce plastics, and their produce section is always messy. The employees are not friendly and their rude. They always ignore me when I ask for a bag.<//Review>

Disrespectful  Employees, Walmart should train Employees appropriately, and inform them that certain things can lead to a store being shut down. I called in to bring something to the stores attention. I was then treated as if i was lying. I don't care about the money. Now I will be going to the FDA. ILL ADD SOME PHOTOS OF COCKROACHES ON MY rotisserie chicken. Ill stick to Safeway or Railys. 🤢🤢🤢< /Review>

Walmart should be ashamed of this store. Yesterday I went there to get produce. They were out of vegetables. Many shelves were empty throughout the store. I asked if they were closing this site. The answer was “no we just don’t have enough inventory”. Hmmmm not good.< /Text>

The selection is old merchandise and the prices are higher than Raleys. I recommend filling your prescriptions next door at CVS and doing your shopping up the street at Raleys.< /Text>

It is Wal Mart, yeaaa. But no, it is way too small. Always crowded, closes at 12- good and bad. Just groceries- limited items. Cust. Service desk is getting more and more congested.<//Text>

<Date>1488359489963<//Date><Name>kgkgkg30< /Name><pics>None<//pics><Review>Ive been living a stones throw away from this Walmart for all most 4 years now and after tonights experience i will go out of my way and go up the street to the other Walmart. I went in there and grabbed a couple things as usual. I tell the girl at the checkout that i needed some ciggerates. When she comes back there is another employee standing there waiting to relieve her. She asks for my ID. The other employee says out loud ' why are you IDing him? He's old'. I have never been so disrespected like that ever in a customer service environment. If that isnt the definition of discrimination then i dont know what is. Believe it or not that is the second time in the past 2 years an employee of this store has insulted my age. The first time wasnt that bad but still unprofessional. But this time it had my blood boiling. I was shaking. I went back in the store and spoke with the manager. I explained to her that basically if he had done that in a different setting he wouldn't be pleased with the results of his actions. If you are an employee of this store i want you to understand something. The laws that protect you from discrimination and harassment in the work place are the same laws that protect the consumer. What im saying is think before you speak to a customer. If your not sure what to say then dont say anything. Not a single one of us wants to be there in the first place and that includes you so the entire situation is already socially awkward and frustrating. I look forward to speaking with customer service about this because nobody should be treated like this especially when 40% of the times i open my wallet im doing it in a Walmart checkout line.<//Review><gmapID>0x809ad97f430d01db:0xd0a7b7b4b8d17393</gmapID>< Response>

Neighborhood Walmart is very convenient for me I am handicapped only problem is all boxes and I always mixed makes it difficult for getting products from Shelf sometimes they're right up against the Shelf which makes it unable to get what you need.< /Review>

<review>This neighborhood market is close to my house so I have gone there twice, both times there were lines because the they only had self checkouts open. I don't understand why they built this store, there are two Walmart super centers within three miles(Watt & El Camino, Watt & I80).</review>< pictures>

This little Walmart is always busy, long lines and slow cashiers. Especially at the customer service counter. Have to repeatedly ask for more bags even after telling them I want everything bagged. I'm paying for them so I don't know why they are stingy with them. Only market in the area.< /review>
