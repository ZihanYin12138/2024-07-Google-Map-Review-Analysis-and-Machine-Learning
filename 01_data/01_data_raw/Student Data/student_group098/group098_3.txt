<Review>Alright y'all, so here's the deal. This hidden alcove is "dope AF" as some millennials would say. They sourced these shipping containers from Long Beach to create a literal coffee shop. Can we say "cool concept?!" And eco friendly too. Now that's some upcycling I can get down with. So they mastered the ambiance -- but what about the coffee? Oh yeaaaaaa. That too! The lavender latte is delicious and was made with care. Thanks Lucile for making me feel welcome in this caffeinated joint!! Will be back often. So stay tuned for more reviews about the dranks I try. Baby B Fresh, out.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Not bad at all. Good artisan coffee, great set up.  The man at the counter was polite and easy going.  Ambiance overall was good and the place popular.

The only thing that looses a star and I want to constructively give it a thought that the noise is too high - blender going in one ear and the music in the other made it hard to talk with my fiance while there.

A keto menu would also be be awesome!  As a suggestion as well.< /Review></record>

We usually spend our time here with my friends because we all love coffee. It became a nice hobby for us to enjoy. We also met lots of cool people in this place and yes we like to talk about love and coffee occasionally. We ended up the day with fun! That's why we choose this place whenever we have something to talk about and something to enjoy!< /review>

In the area for the day... it's nice to find specialty coffee shops with good food around the area. Got an iced lavender latte, their syrup has a wonderful taste... and also a almond nut butter toast with yummy fruit on top, my cravings are definitely satisfied</text>

<review>I have to say I'm a fan of this coffee shop. Very spacious and their customer service is improving. I used to be intimidated by their setting and price of food and coffees but it's just quite reasonable when you get to try it and enjoy those too. The store gets busy but their crews are still calm, pretty, patient, and accommodating. This is probably one of my faves. Highly recommended!</review></record>

I definitely like the vibe of this place and it's pretty chilled. The staff are friendly and always greet everyone when they come in. I like my iced mocha and it tastes very light, not too overwhelming with great amount of sugar. The interior design of this place is pretty cute but very small.</text>

<review>I can't remember a time I walked into a coffee shop, smelled some pretty cool candles from Brooklyn,and rolled on some organic perfume and the turned around and ordered a hot bees knees drink (coffee, oatmilk and spicy honey).  I slurped that bad boy down in 20 minutes and I one of those people that never finishes my coffee with cream. Many thanks to my Hermosa Beach resident friend for the best coffee drink of my life. It's a must drink place to go to get that sugar and spice.<//review><GmapID>0x80c2b5960fc0267f:0xf44eea8000941a1c</GmapID><Date>1568083226709</Date></record>

<Review>I finally found a breakfast place that everyone can agree on at work! It's so delicious and the coffee is my favorite, so smooth and not acidic. I love getting half protein açaí bowl and either half a mañana sandwich or half sereno or avocado toast and share with a friend. It's so filling I don't eat again until dinner time. They have amazing pastries too! I love the blueberry muffin and scones.</Review><username>Lorenzo Campbell<//username></record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>NEW fav breakfast spot! I live in Glendale and unfortunately we don't have any little breakfast cafés to walk to you anymore. :( So, have always loved Montrose and thought I would look for one there. Everything about this place was great. I sat outside on the patio, beautiful environment. The host was super friendly as well as the server that came to my table. The food was prompt and once it arrived, looked so delicious! Being a French toast connoisseur, I had the French toast, a side of eggs, side of sausage links, coffee and an OJ. Everything about this place was amazing. The French Toast was DELISH!!  Definitely coming back and bringing family and friends with me.< /text>< pictures>

We found Hi-Fi Espresso about a year ago, after stumbling upon one of their posts on Instagram, and it was love at first bite. We've been back more than a dozen times since then and enjoyed ourselves every single time! The coffee is perfect, the food is to die for (probably the best vegan pastries in the Bay) and the service is always great! We can't recommend this place enough.< /text>

Always appreciate a clean restroom. Positive space that welcomes daytime coffee/beer drinkers. Reasonable prices. Free wifi. Allows you to bring in outside food in a versatile environment. Beautiful set up. Convenient for busy bodies. Came here to do some research, definitely coming back to kick it- this place is legit.

Everyone who works here is super friendly and they treat me like an old friend even though I’ve only been going for a couple weeks. They have a small indoor space but compliment it with a nice outdoor patio area. The coffee here is done very well. They use beans from Counter Culture and create quite a quality product. My personal favorite is their split macchiato. They also carry a nice variety of pastries (including vegan and gluten free options) from a local baker. All in all my experience here has always been pleasant and I will be continuing to go here as often as possible.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Our very own hipster coffee place in Hermosa. Doesn't seem to be bad but the service seems a bit nonchalant and there's not really any place to actually sit and relax with your coffee. I would much rather make the trip a bit further down highway 1 to the boy and the bear.< /text>

<Review>A favorite for having a tasty Hi-Fi Espresso and getting some work done. Some places shoot you nasty looks if you pull up the ol' laptop to get some work done, but not this place! They are especially teacher friendly. Lots of seating and sweet pups to pet. This place attracts nice people - the staff and the clientele. I would love to see more food options here!

Great spot for an afternoon coffee on a Sunday. Delicious pastries to accompany their great coffee. They stand behind the products they sell and know the majority of their customers by name.</Review>

Decent atmosphere. Very little seating. Don’t let them talk you into their “Bees Knees” drink. It’s the most expensive drink, and not worth the price.<//text>

<text>Not thrilled about some of their policies. I spoke with one of their "parts pros" and was told the part I needed was a special order and that it would be an extra $9.00 for shipping and it's still gonna take 5 days. This is for ab engine coolant temperature sensor... Maybe 2oz in weight..... The part arrives.... Wrong part... I in turn have to school them with the rite part number that I needed to look up on line.. They had the part in stock and still charged me $9.00 MORE! No refund for shipping nothing.. Their mistake but I gotta pay for it... I will not be returning.</text><user_name>Dr. Zackery S Richardson M.d. (Bandit)<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>brayz game</user_name><Review>Had issues with the online ordering process. Went into the store to get info. STEVEN greeted me at the counter, was extremely polite and eased my stress induced by the online miscommunication. My product will be in same day, regardless of how hard it was to find a auto parts store with R-1234yf refrigerant. Thank you Orielys! And thank you Steven!< /Review>< rate>

Super slow staff and usually overpriced as compared to other places. Had to wait in line for 15 minutes with 2 customers in the store because apparently using a just register for purchases would be absurd.</review>

<Review>This is supposed to be a lab and the lobby is dirty they do not sanitize the pens or counter or sign in tablet between people. My daughter needs to get lab work done and they gave me a warm compress to put on her foot and I’ve been waiting for a hour now lol defeats the purpose of the warm compress bc then they should have been drawing blood within 2-5min of applying the warm compress. This office can do better they need more workers to stay on top of people coming in to be seen.<//Review></record>

Very inefficient. Over an hour to even check us in.  I saw more people leave in frustration than actually got their blood work done.<//review>

<text>I had some lab orders from my physician which had to be completed by the end of the month, happened to see the Westec (PAL) while at a MD appt.  I traveled over & this place was crowded!  They move very quickly & the room just totally emptied out in a very short time! Efficient & actually painless!<//text>< Pics>

I would recommend for you to go early to get your tests done because if you go towards the afternoon it tends to be more full and the wait longer than you want. Great service overall< /text>

The staff is friendly and have a very gentle touch when drawing blood. They make you feel at ease and relaxed so if your afraid of needles they are very calming. I had no waiting time so it was a quick in and out visit.<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Went here today 11/13/18
Our children need to be at school at 8am so we left early to come by here to get our daughters blood drawn. We pulled up at 7:32am. The man looked just finishing up opening the door as I walked into the main building. We sign in. There was about 4 people ahead of us. We signed in and took a seat. We have four children. Aging 1-8 years old. They were playing in the “play area” when my 8 year old starts to take apart the little “puzzle mat” I guess that’s what it’s called. Then my 1 year old started to do it, trying to figure out there the pieces go.. keep in mind by this time it’s 7:55-8:00 we’ve been waiting roughly 30 minuets.. kids are kids and they are getting bored at this point but they are playing and not causing any damage or harm. A lady opens up the door and says “the children are not allowed to take a part the mat please?” I apologize and get my kids off of it. And have my 8 yr old quickly put it back together. Right when my son is finishing it all up another boy walks in, looks about 8 years old. He calmly sits down and he begins to take it apart. I didn’t feel it was my place to say anything to their son. So we just sat there. Sure enough a few seconds later the same woman opens the door and says “excuse me all parents, the mat it not to be taken apart” so that boys father tells their son to put it back together. Now by this time it’s 8:20 we’ve been waiting nearly an hour. My kids are restless! Now they have nothing to entertain them. Several of the elderly people made comments such as “if they don’t want children to play with that thing they need to take it out of here!” And “buy a rug if you don’t want kids taking it apart” I agree! I get it.. I’m sure several parents let their children pull it all apart but don’t take the time to make sure their children put it back together so the workers are stuck doing it. I get it. But get it out then. Get a little rug to put there. Bc that mat is actually made to take a part and put it back together like a puzzle. That’s what kids do. If you’d rather them not, take it out. And if you’d draw my daughters blood we would have gladly left! We walked out at 8:35 over an hour waiting to get blood drawn. Ridiculous. Quest is way better!! Won’t be back here again.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

There is one young woman who saved this rating from getting ½ star. If I find out her name, I'll update the review. I'm here every 4 weeks with time-sensitive specimens, and the employees are short with me, not very helpful and have no sense or urgency. The young woman is always friendly, she greets me, smiles and hurries because she understands. She practices great customer service. Maybe her co-workers should observe her and take notes.<//review>

While I never enjoy going to give blood due to the fact that I don't like needles, the service was great and the phlebotomist who took my blood for the prescribed tests was quick and I didn't even feel when the procedure was done. Great job.</Text>

Honestly, I can't express enough graciousness that I have for the Weingart. I don't know what I would do without the help Im getting from the staff, the administrators the security team my case managers and their supervisors. Maintenance as well.Also I want to do something to show how grateful I am but they make sure that I know that they don't expect anything in return. Im sure every single person that God blesses to come here can say the same thing. Maybe better than I can say it. Thank you Weingart clients as well for being patient with me. I have been wrong in the past and you didnt take my life. Much Love. P.E.A.C.E.</review>

<Text>This place is full of racist Mexicans who don't help African Americans. And the staff who is African American are passive scared to lose their job so they don't speak up. But none of the really care none of they do the job they signed up for. The security steals and are racist against anyone not Mexican. The rooms are nasty my bed showed signs of bedbug infestation walls covered in stuff. They DON'T want normal people trying to make a better life they prefer drug addicts. I needed help after losing my job they treat you like you are stupid. This place is only open and in it for the money. They make you put your valuable bike outside where criminals that work for them can steal your bike. THEY NEED TO RESTAFF AND RESTART WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REALLY HELP.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3y8zwC9w8xz3dtIjfJ3xWswB7GPpR7XUW55uI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2c636cedf7989:0xcfe314b5a9df9535<//GmapID></record>

<Review>The staff is very good. If you are willing to get the help you need and to work with the programs and staff, you will be able to get good results. Do be careful about your property as there are those who will not be trust worthy (also some are dangerous excons).< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c636cedf7989:0xcfe314b5a9df9535< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Too many diseased people. Drugs being sold in and around the building. Individuals throw urine and fecal matter from their windows on to the sidewalk. The staff in the building treat you like a criminal. Their elevators break-down at least once a month. They use Soy and Tofu as meat replacements in their cafeteria. Drugs being sold directly in front of the cafeteria. Drug addicts and alcoholics loiter and panhandle in front of the building.< /Review>

Over 15 yrs ago I was a resident in the Weingart program. This is where I learned all I know about job preparation and life skills from a teacher named Ms. White at the then Leavy Education center. If you're like I was then. I suggest you give the staffs at the Weingart the opportunity to set a life plan for you to get your life back in order.</Review>

<Review>FILTHY, horrifically LOUD, Much of the staff are impatient, arrogant, untrained, I’ll tempered and disrespectful. It’s Dark, Dreary, LOUD, HARD, Angry and dismal. Catering to the most desperate/disparate in our society it’s last stop & should be. In their bid to serve ‘ALL’ they miss the mark Grandly. When the VA stopped paying my way (OUR WAY) they kicked me (US) out unceremoniously.
Shameful.< /Review>< Rating>

<time>1500271022322</time><rate>4</rate><review>This is a homeless shelter with a focus on drug rehabilitation, job training on site, and a whole floor for people with serious illnesses staffed by medical personnel.  This is probably the best shelter in the downtown area.  They even have single rooms with doors that can be locked by their occupants for those who are complying with the program requirements.  They also have on site counseling.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c636cedf7989:0xcfe314b5a9df9535<//GmapID></record>

The most wonderful kind and caring staff, However my first year working there I wondered why the retention rate of employees was so low. The  building is a night mare  And the administrative staff pretends that they don't realize the need.. The  new CFO  IS SO insecure that she  Retaliated  when I complained . but that's her reputation  . The clients are out of control, But its due to the fact that there's only one Clinical Social Worker that is willing to work under extreme  conditions  Anything goes as long as the center gets paid foe the beds that are rented   by the Dept. of Mental Health. Probation and Parole.  possible acts of violence, are frequent . my first year a man jumped out the window and killed himself  .Staff  and clients were attacked the elevators are a danger they break thee time a week or more. the living area is dirty  and broken up,   complain about the conditions you're sure to get terminated< /review>

My co-worker Monique B went to Weingart Center to have a TB SKIN Test and the latino person who administered the test must have used a dirty needle and did not even clean the skin area.   My friend has a round black circle and swelling for months.   Please be careful because there are idiots everywhere who do not know how to do their job.  My friend still has the black mark up until today.<//Text>

<Text>If I could give them a negative ZERO, i would.
The weingart has staff that are THIEVES. My husband stayed there, and they kicked him out for being one our late when I was in the hospital getting tests run because I am a cancer survivor and I've had symptoms of the cancer returning. I am STILL having a bunch of tests done, and my husband and I are disabled, and my husband was calling his counselor at the weingart every hour on the hour, to let them know what was going on. They decided to kick him out when he arrived ONE hour late - they packed all his belongings, EXCEPT WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO KEEP. They stole two gibson  (worth more than $5000) and DVD player from him. A week later, we ran into a friend, P****, at the hospital, who was so upset, because he was having heart problems, and the weingart did the same thing - they kicked him out, packed his stuff and kept two of his flat screen televisions, over 100 brand new DVD's and a DVD player. Our friend E**** also had MONEY stolen from his wallet, right after he had just cashed his social security check! As well as our friend W***, who also had money stolen from him. The STAFF needs to be held accountable for what they are doing! T?hey are supposed to be HELPING people - and instead, they are STEALING from people. They are taking things from people who are down and out, hurting, struggling with addiction and the mentally ill. They are taking advantage of people who are weak and afraid - afraid of losing their housing if they stand up and say or do anything when they have things stolen from them, and the weingart staff know this.
My husband and I have been clean and sober for 15 months now, and we are disabled and still struggling with numerous health issues. We took the weingart to court, and sued them for what they stole from my husband. The representative for the weingart, E* and my husband's counselor (WHO SAW MY HUSBAND'S BELONGINGS, AND LIED IN COURT), J****, they offered us $200, then $300, then $500 - to try to get us to settle outside of court - and we said NO, we want them held accountable. It's really not even about money - we want to EXPOSE THEM, so they stop taking advantage of homeless, down and out people.
Right before court, E* offered us  $700, saying that even if we won, that they would appeal, and wear us down, keep us in court for a few YEARS. They KNOW we're disabled - they kept asking for continuances, over and over, probably thinking we wouldn't be able to keep up with the court dates - my husband and I are both in EXTREME PAIN, and use walkers to get around. We still refused to settle.
Finally, right before the last court day, E* offered $1000 as 'the last offer" - he should a copy of some paper that SUPPOSEDLY my husband signed, without the belongings they stole from him on the list. I was too sick to go to court with my husband the last time, but HE WON - PRAISE GOD - the judge must have sen they were lying, or that they've stolen from other people also.
The LAST DAY the weingart could appeal, we received a letter saying they HAVE APPEALED, and we have another court date, July 2nd. IF ANYONE HAS STAYED THERE - we want to expose them, and I may even contact the media about thus. They are SO WRONG for doing what they're doing. My husband had to go to the hospital the day after he received the appeal, for chest pains, and they admitted him, because he had a blood clot. He had also been hospitalized a day before then as well. The stress regarding the court trips are very, very, tiring. But we WILL PERSEVERE!!! :-P

2019 - WE still WON $2000 AFTER they appealed!!!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>Not only is the neighborhood completely vile, i couldn't get into the program without any identification. The hotel vouchers department of social services issues only provide for half a month's stay. On the bright side the place costs 14 dollars a day and has a tv room with a microwave. Laundry is free. The bathroom stinks really bad and the shower is shared, but the water is hot. The other bad part is that you need a money order to get in there and need some sort of id to get your key every time you go outside. And the final good part is that there is a guard screening everyone with a metal detector wand and checking bags for contraband. But the neighborhood is awful.<//Text>< Rate>

It's true what people say about receiving services there, however as an employee I have to say it's not the employees fault for things going wrong, it's the managers of the departments , case managers, the corporate office, and the CEO's fault for not communicating properly with the employees and contradicting themselves. As a former employee working there I can assure you this is what usually happens not to mention the drama between employees and staff complaining about their job nonstop. If you are looking for a job, please do not apply here, there is so much discrimination among staff and miscommunication is rampant. My former manager Tamara Edmonds covered for employees every time I would tell her that staff was being unprofessional and did nothing to solve the problems and instead pitted staff against each other. I quit this job due to the fact that both clients and staff don't get the recognition for working hard with the population. They would tell us to don't turn away clients but only to get money out of each and every one who arrives there since the Vice President Monica Guthrie Davis only cares about numbers and sees the homeless population as numbers. There is also drama among employees< /Text></record>

I worked as a guard there over 4 years ago, I would rover to fill in from time to time and I would rarely pay attention because on all my breaks and lunches I'd go in the car and hit the weed 3 or 5 times. I never used the metal detector I would just pretend to but never had it running while scanning people.< /review>

Before the real one comes
But to some it is more
Like being in jail I know it
Did help alot of others out
Of hard times so I can not
Say it is all bad in no way
The way they should put it
Is this is a reststop before
Housing comes😂😁😢😔<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c636cedf7989:0xcfe314b5a9df9535</Gmap_id></record>

The Waldo's triple IPA is fantastic. Staff is friendly (And rather cute) (-: I only get to come here a couple times a year. I'm a truck driver. When I have the chance this is where I'm at.< /Review>

What a gem to come across in this town in the middle of nowhere! Lots of craft brews on both tap and bottle, friendly and efficient service, great music playing on the stereo, and small and intimate atmosphere. If one is into the craft beer scene this is definitely the place to go in Redding. Highly recommended. No kitchen here though.<//Text>

Love the beer selection. Even in summer they have something for everyone. Being able to order takeout from a restaurant and bring it in to enjoy with our beer was a major perk. Friendly staff. Relaxed atmosphere. 👌 🍺< /Review>

Stopped in because of the good music.  Stayed for two pints + of great beer.  Robert was both knowledgeable and friendly, offering excellent recommendations and insights into the craft brewing industry.

A great place to whet your whistle and cool your heels.<//text>

By far my favorite bar in Redding. The selection of beers that the owner picks himself is amazing. If you love good beer, look no further. Atmosphere is always great and the bar staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Not super expensive either.</Text>

<Text>The Alehouse is probably the best bar in Redding if you're a beer enthusiast.  They always have a ton of amazing brews on tap of basically every kind.  They have light ales, porters, a bunch of IPA's (my least favorite, but my friends who like IPA's Saturday they're good), and frequently at least a few sours.  The vibe is chill, the music is good, and the service is friendly.

It's a little spendy.  Parking isn't the best, but they share a lot with a chain sports bar, so you can easily park there.  That's it.  That's the extent of the negative portion of the review.

If you've got a few spare bills and want to try some excellent beers in a very relaxed atmosphere, go to the Alehouse.< /Text>< rate>

"No crap on tap" is their motto. This is the defacto place to drink the best craft beer in northern California. You would be hard pressed to find another establishment north of the bay area that offers the quality and rare beers that The Alehouse has on tap, everyday. If you're looking for a light beer that resembles water more than beer, you'll need to go someplace else!</review>

Some of the rarest sours, and barrel aged beers I have ever found. Taps rotate to something different all the time. This is a great spot to catch the game and have some awesome beers, they also have a bottle shop for take home rare finds. They don't have food yet but will in the future after talking g to the owner Rob. Probably the best spot in Redding to get a good beer at a decent price.</Review>

<rate>4</rate><review>I was actually able to find an imperial stout and a dopple on draught in the middle of summer...that's a rare thing and worth the drive from Corning for a date night with a fellow brew afficionado.  Fair prices and wide, well varied selection with a handful of good bottle choices just to cover the spread.  It smelled a little musty like a dive bar, but the atmosphere was relaxing and people were friendly with live sports on the easily visible TVs.  If you're looking for fresh draught of an out of season brew through clean lines... This is your joint.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Went a few months ago. I had a nail in my tire. I went in to get a used tire which I paid 50 for which is more than I usually pay for a used tire at my old tire spot. I was okay with paying it because that was the most newest used tire haha. It was well worth it. On top of them being very nice. I always go when I need air or for them to check my tires. I always try to pay since I feel like it's the right thing to do but they never let me they always say no you're good. I believe good customer service is major! It's what brings people back. So I will continue coming to them. Because they've always been kind and quick.i love to support family businesses. My apa loved going to them before he passed so I will continue to as well.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Got 2 front tires. On my way to work next morning discovered they hadn't been balanced. Mechanic argued with me, tried to say my shaking was caused by something else,however it only started shaking after he installed my tires.  Managed had him balance them "again". He did this with attitude and continued to blame the shaking on another problem. This time there was no shaking. Needless to say  I won't be a returning customer.</Review>< pictures>

I was traveling through Bakersfield and got a flat. I called first thing in the morning and the gentleman (I didn't catch a name) and he said he had the same size. Once I arrived at the location, it literally took him 20 minutes tops from consultation to new tire on my car. This place literally saved my entire vacation! Great service!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) What a pain it is to see people so young and bitter. day or night or whatever you want to call your bad time but the truth that having a staff with that bad attitude leaves a lot to be said

(Original)

Came through the drive thru and it has taken over 15 minutes for someone to show up. I placed my order over an hour ago to avoid this but it didn't make a difference.</review>

Julio, (Store Manager) is Very unprofessional.  Rude, unpleasant and doesn't care that his employees make the wrong Pizza order. His staff at night has NO customer service experience.  Hospitality doesn't seem to exist at Coachella Pizza hut<//text>

The food was good. Although the staff was nice, it's in a desert city were maybe they dont get so busy. I feel like they all needed triple espressos and help from the manager and other coworkers.  Our waiter was trying his best. We went in with our soccer team and families. I speak as an ex server who worked in an environment where we all helped each other out and went at super speeds during busy hours.< /Review>

Very good costumer service. Our server was great. The pizza was real good but I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the salad bar open because I like to have salad with my 🍕. When we were leaving there was a  costumer that got the wrong order but  they worked hard to get his order as fast as they could. Then after came another costumer saying his pizza wasn't cooked all they way. I guess they were very bussy. That's why didn't put a 5 🌟 on the review.  Although it didn't happen to me I felt like I need it to comment on it.</text>

Service is really bad and staff aren't fair. My family came first and we have our order and then another family came and got their meal like nothing. Overall the food is good but it makes you wait for so long you just want to walkout.<//Review>

< Review>
I am a regular customer here but every time i ask for extra cheese it seems like they understand "light on cheese" makes me mad because i pay extra for nothing, I tell them and they look at it and say its fine when all you can see is the sauce with just spots of cheese. The Indio Pizza Hut is now preffered by me and my family they KNOW what extra cheese means.< /Review>

First time going to this Pizza Hut, I usually go to the one in Indio. It may be nicer looking but the service was bad. Ordered carry out and took over 30 min to receive even though got an email saying it was ready. Only ordered wings and garlic nots. They were cold and the nots were stale and like little to no cheese. I feel ridiculous writing this but man all I wanted was some garlic nots. :-(</review>

<Text>Love it here. the pizza we ordered always comes out fine, oh wait, with the exception of once but we asked them to re-do it and it was perfect. we usually get the same waitress and she's great! drinks are yummy ad not watered down like other places. the only complaint i have is that the music customers can purchase and play in the restaurant is usually loud, and typical loud mexican music which can get annoying.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I went in today At 5:50 PM , and the lady at the front desk was just tapping away with the back staff didn’t even acknowledge that I was waiting for a table . Afternoon 2 min of standing she finally sat me down and said she would be back to take my order 7 Min pass and no sign of her, so I took my 2 daughters to the ladies room when I got back I noticed she  Was sitting a family of 3 directly behind me no biggie, except for the fact that she started taking their order . I leaned over and said excuse me ma’am but I have been here much longer than they have and I have been ready to order Over 10 Min algo age rudly replies well I am taking their order I will start from here and move my way towards you . I advised her that I had been there 15-20 minutes they just got there and my drinks haven’t even been ordered she was so rude I ended up ordering dominos and leaving they need to work on their customer service they aren’t fair or nice at all< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

Horrendous customer service from the manager, threatened to call the cops on dine in guests. They took our order at around 10pm. Were waiting for food for almost an hour. Then he told us we had to leave at closing time (11pm), even if we had already ordered and still not got our food. Threatened to call the cops and made multiple families leave. Didn't get food until 11:45 after almost two hours of waiting.<//Text>

< review>
Worst experience ever not only did they mest up on my buffalo wings once that day. After letting them know nicely they gave me the wrong flavor, they said they will make me new ones. The new buffalo wings arrive so soon. I grabbed one and when I cut it in half it was plain raw I started cutting more and they were all raw my sisters had already eating one. The manager told me she'll give me a refund which was take the wings of my bill. Really? Really? Did she really expect me to payed for them. We've been feeling sick since last night. Keep an eye on our wings or anything they cook.< /review>

<text>I was disgusted with the customer service. Not only was both of my pizzas made wrong they made insisted that it was right and did not want to correct it because they were closing. They did not offer credit and I can to pick it up. I left and my husband called back and they gave him a free side, not the pizzas. THUMBS DOWN!<//text></record>

<text>The only reason why Im giving this place one star is because the food was ok. Other than that the service was terrible we sat at the table for 10 min before anyone came over and took our drink order & the place was empty. Our server Elizebeth was rude and had poor customer service. She took our order and didnt offer drinks until we asked. When she brought us our food she just sat it on the table and walked away not asking if we need anything or responding to our thank you. We ate our whole meal without being asked how the food was. We didnt get any refills on our drinks. Elizebeth did not smile the whole time we were there she did not make us feel welcome. This is the worst experience ive had at any Pizza hut.< /text>< pictures>

Pizza tasted bit better than Domino's but the crust was awful also charged almost double of what Domino's charges regularly. Not worth the price.</text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad they tell you that in 15 minutes you spend arecojerlas and you arrive and they still last 30 minutes to give it to you and the pieces lack ingredients for which you already paid and you tell them and they set Bravos and they tell you that another 7 minutes to fix them. Very bad service

(Original)
Muy mala te dicen que en 15 minutos pases arecojerlas y llegás y  duran todavía 30 minutos para dártela y alas piezas les faltan ingredientes por los que tu ya pagaste y les dices y seteponen Bravos y te dicen que otros 7 minutos para arreglarlas. Muy mal servicio.< /text>

They deserve great ratings! Art was by far the best barber in town. I've been using his services for about a year now and have been more than pleased with the results after each visit. Professional service and fair pricing. Cheers to more customers and success in the future. A five-stars satisfaction rating all the way for this tremendous shop.< /Text>

I brought my son to this barbershop a week ago. I was so happy with my son's new-look. I thanked your barber man for the excellent and perfect work he did at that time. Five stars for the overall work of your barber! You are strongly recommended to everyone! Until next time! Thank you so much, guys!< /Review>

<Review>There are a variety of floral designs to choose from. You can also change things according to your own preferences. Their flowers, bouquet arrangements, and flower stand are all of exceptional quality and well worth the cost.  They're also in charge of ensuring that deliveries are made on time and in a reliable manner. It's heavily advised!</Review>< Pics>

<text>He's not rushed while doing the haircut of my boyfriend. After the service, he's so happy for he looked so young with his new haircut. I always recommend this barbershop to everyone who asks where they can get a good haircut, but you request any one of them for they are all professional. I chose this place for I knew that many people talked about this online. I appreciate the time detail and skill of the barber.< /text>< Pics>

Having my hair cut at your barbershop is always a great experience! The barbers were always very hospitable and friendly. I always get my hair cut by the talented staff named Elvin. He listens to my requests patiently and gives me honest advice. Thank you as always! You are strongly recommended to all!< /text>

Great job! The barber did a very nice haircut and color that made me very overwhelmed and thankful. Right now, I looked handsome and decent because of its style.  Also, I love to visit this shop because it was clean, stylish, and cool. Besides, I was a satisfied customer who was willing to ask service again and again. Thanks a lot!< /text>

Carlos was awesome. You get a feel for new age barber with old age barber. Started with electric clippers, scissors, lotion with hot towel, then straight razor for touch ups. I recommend any guy ready to lose his beard give Carlos a call.</Review>

<Review>I wasn't expecting this amazing barbershop to be so amazing. My hair is now looking amazing! Their assistance has fully satisfied me. My questions were all answered, and the services they provided were clearly priced. I will, without a doubt, tell all of my classmates about them.</Review>< Pictures>

My mother had asked me to buy flowers, and I happened to pass by this flower shop on the side of the road. It was very convenient for me because it was close to my house and they had a very reasonable rate for the majority of the flowers. Since their customers have a large parking lot, I got my parking lot just right. Exceptionally efficient!</text>

This place is great and I can't recommend it enough. The pricing is very fair and I think they could charge more based on the quality. The staff was super friendly and beard trim was excellent. I don't live in town, but if I did this would be my regular place. I had Carlos give me a cut and he is a true pro. I'm sure the rest of the staff is just as good, but trust me when I say Carlos is who you want. I will be back.< /Text>

<Review>I asked one of their hairstylist which hairstyle that suits for me. He gave me some pictures and recommendations.  So, I choose the one that he suggested,  and it turns out really good.

My favorite part is the hot towel afterward. Highly recommended!< /text>< pics>

GREAT JOB! I would like to thank this barbershop for doing my haircut because it was extremely good. The charges are at a good price, and thanks to these guys that was able to handle everything that I wanted. It was indeed a masterful display of service! I humbly thank you, especially your barbers!< /Review>

<review>I have been going to Erick for the last year and couldn't be happier with his talents. I'm not an easy customer with respect that I don't tell Erick what I want. I basically tell him to use his experience to make me look as good as possible (I need all the help I can get!) and he delivers every time.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5<//rate><text>AWESOME place! This barbershop is truly one of the best when it comes to trimming and cutting hair. It was their barber who cut my hair, and it was nice because I really look good when I looked at the mirror. What a nice service, guys! I will surely recommend your barbershop to all of my family and friends!<//text>< pics>

This Barbershop was superb! Everything here was top notch from the moment you walk in the door, and the staff works hard to keep the place in top shape and to make you feel good. I have gotten cuts from several barbers, and they have all been excellent. I will surely come back and recommend the place to my friends.< /Text>

First off this is a great place. I have been coming here for some time now since I have been introduced and always leave satisfied. This Barbershop is the best in town. Even at such a disadvantaged starting point, my haircut came out of perfection.</Review>

Went to get a haircut here after months of not getting one. When I walked in, I was greeted and seated for my haircut right away (no appointment). Nestor was the barber that cut my hair and man, he did an amazing job. He guided me through the haircut to ensure it was perfect, paid attention to detail and lined/faded me up pretty well. For the price, this was a great haircut. I am definitely coming back for my future haircuts.< /text>

<text>This place is great! I recently left my last barber because I would make appointments and still have to wait. Ever since then, I've been on the look for a new shop. My friend told me about this place and I decided to give it a shot. I was totally taken by surprise. It's the best place to watch the game, get a cut, and have a drink. They are clean, organized, and my barber was great. I have referred all my friends to this place, and I can't wait to go back!< /text><date>1548705079907<//date><user>100988387955279402022<//user>< pics>

So Ive been hearing about this place for a while, wanted to see what all the hype was. One of the best barbershops ive been to. Right when you walk in they offer you complimentary drinks and are welcomed by the barbers. I had my fade done by Nestor and he did an amazing job, all at an affordable cost. Really get the bang for your buck at this place. Would highly recommend. Definitely come back here.</text>

I recently moved to the area and had the chance to visit a few barbershops in the neighborhood all of which either didn’t listen to what I wanted or I didn’t feel comfortable being at. The guys are Beverly Hills barbershop made me feel so welcomed from the moment I walked in. Nestor took the time to listen to what I wanted and took the time to pay attention to detail. I was also offered water which I thought was a plus. love this place!
Highly recommended!!< /review>

One of the best barbershop in town. Friendly amazing staff my barber was Marley he was very detailed and professional and really spend a lot of time getting the haircut i want. The place is very clean and nice love how it has lot of television for sporting as well as a game console in case you want to hang around. Bravo 5 plus stars.< /review>

I have a hard head to cut! my hair is thick and tough to work with. with that said not everyone can work with my type of hair. I just recently heard about this place and because the last place i went to didn't do a great job i gave these guys a shot. Jamil was great! she took the time to understand what i wanted and also gave me the exact cut i wanted. I love this place and also found parking very easy.</Review>

<Text>Its hard to believe that finally someone got it right. I can make my appointment easily and not have to wait 2 hours to get a cut! It was hard to switch barbers but I couldn’t take waiting any longer. I recently found out about Beverly Hills barbershop, I called and I was able to make an appointment easily. I was sat on time by my barber and I have to also add that I got an amazing cut. Highly recommend this spot!</Text>< Pics>

My hubby has tons going on so being able to get a last minute appointment was so amazing. He was lost with parking and staff was awesome enough to come out and navigate. The cut and beard shave was so clean and affordable. He came back looking like I came back from the nail salon. Pampered, relaxed and happy.  He’ll totally be back.<//Text>

This is a great place to get a haircut and the vibe is awesome! All the barbers are well skilled, professional and friendly. Prices are also very reasonable and it's easy to make an appointment. I would definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for a new barber or just wants to up their game.<//Review>

Ive lived in the area for almost 20 years and it was finally time for a place like beverly hills barbershop to come in that can provide the level of barbering we all desire.

Bevery hills barber shop is the best barbershop in LA! Brand new but they know what they are doing! Jamil was great she took care of me and really listened to what I wanted to do with my hair. Will highly recommend this barber shop to all my family and friends. Free Parking is convenient  in the back alley.<//review>

I have been to many barbershops.. I mean MANY and this one stood out the most to me. I don't even know where to start. The XBOX was the biggest surprise for me as I was waiting for a haircut. Complementary drinks as well are very refreshing as well as the numerous facial treatments they offer . Haircuts are top notch and would highly recommend it to anyone. The owner is so nice and is VERY accommodating as well. Highly recommended. I will be back!!</Text>

Wow!! What a barbershop!! This place is so well designed I fell in love with it the moment I walked in! The red chairs against the old school wood look. Vintage shop I must say. Jamil is an amazing barber who went above and beyond with her talent to cut my hair. I am very pleased with my cut. Plus got a free drink to go! These guys really care.< /Text>

I like to get cut about once a week as I always want to look fresh and try to always be looking my best. My friend literally just told me about this Barbershop and said it was the best experience. I am usually not one to take friends advice blindly, so I went a couple days ago and experienced it for myself. The ambiance is amazing (feels like I was kinda a celebrity), super friendly staff and they actually catered to my needs and wants. I got exactly the haircut I was looking for with the fade I wanted and this is now my GO TO for the foreseeable future. Also for this month they had a special deal which made the place even sweeter!< /Text>< pics>

It’s hard to find a good barber that does the job well and well enough to do it repeatedly. This is now my go to barber. They do a great job and take their time and are very detailed. Price is also decent.<//review>

First timer at this barbershop and I couldn't have asked for anything better. I'm very picky with my haircuts by the way... like VERY picky. Such an amazing environment, great customer service, complimentary water and soda as you wait patiently, friendly staff, parking was a breeze. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</text>

I am amazed how great everything went! I was a bit scared to try a new shop but I couldn’t be happier with my cut. I parked on the side street plenty of street parking. My barber jamil quickly sat me and I was on my way on time. I highly recommend this spot.< /Review>

Recently left my current barber and enjoyed an amazing cut by the man Swins. I went in with a friend who had an appointment with Jamil and we both left with some of the best hair cuts we've ever gotten. It almost felt like a family barber with all the luxuries you would expect in a salon. All the members of the staff are very kind and welcoming offering drinks the second you come through the door and come on, a brand new Xbox with two controllers couldn't hurt. Overall, a great experience!</Review>

An old school barbershop with a modern touch. Great haircuts. There is plenty of parking in the back. The lakers game is on and there are complimentary drinks. I almost forgot..... Xbox while you wait if you didn’t book an appointment. I am so excited this spot opened up in town and I will have to say the barbers are experienced and pay attention to detail.</review>

I though it was impossible to find a legit  barbershop in LA. However,  these feelings  changed  when I  went to BH Barbershop for the first time the other day. I can genuinely say that I experienced  "Beverly Hills" quality service and a  professional barber quality haircut/shave; minus the burden of paying the a "Beverly Hills" premium. I highly recommend  BH Barbershop to anyone looking for an amazing barbershop experience in LA</Text>

Brand new place! Have already been here a few times! Everyone should know how important a barber is to a guy and im soooooooo ecstatic to have finally found a great one. I have been jumping around for a while and im so happy to have finally found such a great place. I dont even live in LA! I live in Pomona, and I wait for the couple times that I come to LA a month to get my haircut now. I can enjoy a cold drink, watch the game, sit and get a facial for a good price! Nestor! You the man!< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Ive been to almost each and ever barbershop and men's salon in Los Angeles // Beverly Hills and I am most satisfied and happy with BEVERLY HILLS BARBER SHOP. I was treated extremly well, it is in a great location with parking accebility, the shop is kept clean (which is imperative in my expirence), and the ambience which is crucial in a great haircut expirience  is on point. Although all of the barbers are fabulous, I WOULD HIGH ADVISE YOU TO GO WITH THE FEMALE BARBER. She is wonderful and has a gentle touch as well as she cuts your hair to the exact percision of what you are looking for. best believe< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>The guys working were so nice and the smoothie made me feel amazing. Tasted so good and was so refreshing with fresh fruit. I loved seeing all the fresh ingredients on the counter as well.

Super yummy and delicious healthy bowls. I've tried almost everything on their menu.The staff is so friendly and their prices are reasonable. There are only two places in Orange County, I enjoy healthy bowls. This is one of them. I've tried other establishments, they don't come close. Hands down to Impact Juice Bar! :)<//Text>

Love this place! Definitely pricey compared to nearby juice bars but everything I've tried is top notch as far as flavor and ingredients. Highly recommend the Green Power smoothie! It's surprisingly delicious & the best green smoothie I've ever had. They also have tons of snacks, kombucha, CBD water/oil and cold brew options which is awesome.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Great staff. Amazing juices and smoothies. I work around the corner and prior to Impact opening I would occasionally head to Growl Juice Pub for my juice fixes. Their cold pressed juices were just to steeply priced though, and the store alway had an awkward highschool dance vibe going on due to the young staff. I'm stoked to have a quality place to go now with a friendly and personal staff.

<review>This is the best food I've had in about 12 years. This is the most authentic Italian food I've had since being in Italy.  There was among wait, but well worth it. Our server was so knowledgeable,  attentive and nice.  However,  I couldn't hear her name because of the mask. I love the atmosphere inside the restaurant.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJu1At9iLziaHIBI59yLqfz6kyNCbexnZLHt9r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1wLTjkpDxxnnPqDyUzLqA4x3emBjK6amhcDLa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<review>Wow, I thought this was some of the best Italian around this area. I went for lunch and they offer a bunch of good lunch specials,  I only had the lasagna because I was craving it for awhile. It was piping hot, smooth, creamy and balanced. I was very satisfied. Went there with a friend and we had a few drinks as well.I Will definitely go back soon to see if the rest of there items are as delicious. Good atmosphere, friendly staff and spacious dining. Very clean! Thanks Vinceno's delicious!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>This place has been my Italian spot for about 18 years. Hands down is the best Italian food in Southern California. If you like Mainstream egg noodles and ketchup then go to The Olive Garden. If you enjoy flavorful Authentic Italian food then look no further and come here, I hope they never change Vincenzo's recipes because that's where it's at. Excellent food, friendly staff and good service.<//text>< pictures>

<review>My dish was good. Order the lasagna and we asked for a sausage pizza but received pepperoni. They did fix are order but the pizza wasn't good, too much oil and the dough wasn't cooked. But over all great experience and good customer service.< /review>< user_id>

Overall this place is a solid Italian restaurant with good service and good food. This review is for a takeout order I placed. I had the Spaghetti pasta with meatballs. The meatballs were big, delicious, spicy. Their spaghetti sauce was great also, the flavors and spices are a perfect combo. The pasta was correctly cooked.

The service was good also, although not the best I've experienced it was definitely not lacking in good service. They were just really busy after opening their dine-in back up for the first time in along time cause of covid so it was understandable.< /Text>

Used to eat here often, but haven't in a while. I like the food so i get it to go lately. Service is still very good and had always been clean, which I'm sure it still is, I just don't like eating at nice places alone, so haven't eaten there in a while.</text>

<review>Amazing authentic pasta with excellent service. I love their seafood pasta dish! I always modify it to a creamy tomato sauce and it’s superb. And my daughter is crazy about their tiramisu. I want to try everything on their menu so I will return soon.< /review><user>101986100034607124058</user><Date>1615210532697<//Date>< Resp>

Food and service were excellent. Only thing I would recommend to the owner is to have the kitchen staff keep it down they got a little loud.< /Review>

Service was fabulous, thank you Anna. But meals were slow coming out. Ceasar salad excellent with salmon on it, and I HAD to try the chocolate mouse cake. To die for. Every one loved their meal, some one ordered veal parmesan and it was huge. Shrimp scampi had 5 huge shrimp.
A great place for a party.</review>

I know it's challenging to dine outside. That being said the service was adequate but not amazing. We had to stick our head inside to remind them to refill our water and to bring the parmesan. The food was fresh and presented in a way that was appetizing. The red sauce on the pasta was a bit spicey. Even my husband that enjoys spice said it was excessive. The fried block of parmesan was pretty delicious.</Text>

Wow was recommended to eat here by locals. We were visiting Canyon Lake and we decided to try their food. The best Italian food hands down. I had the eggplant parmesan my husband had the chicken parm. So much food huge side of pasta. Then for dessert we split an delicious huge slice of cheesecake. If your in the Elsinor area must try this place<//Text>

I have been coming here for years and the food is delicious. I have been ordering to go lately and it seems they cannot verify the order correctly however. 3 separate times now I have been shorted on items. That is frustrating especially being 3 consecutive times for me.</review>

<Review>I've been going for years and Vincenzo was my neighbor.. great place and selection and grateful they stay open during the Covid but the  last visit was  pretty bad...we had our own private table with 10 of us for a Christmas week family dinner and the waitress was not busy yet was not around and forgot 4 times to bring the bread as we requested..the pasta dishes were very heavy on black pepper and ruined my meal...very unlike Vincenzo's..yet I had to pay a $48 tip for poor service and lack of attention..was probably the worst $288 spent...I gave 3 stars because they were open..otherwise 1 star...I'll give them another chance in the future...in a year or three...< /Review>< pictures>

Went here with my wife, I got spaghetti with sausage and she got veggie ravioli. Mine was, well, not what I was hoping for. It was edible and all, but I was hoping for something tasty. My wife's raviolis were good but the sauce was somewhat mild/bland.<//Text>

Don’t recommend this place. The lady was very rude and said “this is an Italian restaurant we don’t have jalapeños or wings” so unprofessional I will never come here again.</review>

<text>Went last minute to Vincenzo's and it was great.  Called to see if they were open and then do they have outside seating.  They did and informed me they have two large covered patio areas with some views of the lake and come on down as they had two tables available.  Food was fast and good.  We had drinks also.

This place is dim inside with an intimate feeling and an amazing smell.  It’s been years since I’ve been here, and it seems the same chef is making the delicious dishes.  I’m waiting for my pick up order now! I’d recommend the lasagna! This place is a must have. DELICIOUS!</review>

<text>This place is excellent! I’ve eaten at fancy “Italian” establishments all over and I will say this place is the real deal! I see some reviewers comment about the decor being outdated, seriously?? The inside is what makes this restaurant unique! It is clean, classy, and actually gives you that authentic vibe. The food is always delicious and fresh and they don’t have turnover with staff like many restaurants, that should say something.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>5</rating>< user_name>

< Review>
Very let down. We are regular customers there and recently went in for a late dinner. No wait and plenty of open tables. However the prices have gone up quite a bit and the complimentary bread and salsa/bruschetta is not longer free but offered for a nominal fee. The service staff seemed irritated and not completely into their work to serve the customers. We could feel that. We also over heard others complaining about the changes. It felt as if there was a ownership change, but can't confirm that. Several other options locally that offer a better value and experience, such as Giovani's in Menifee ( 10 min away). You will be treated as if you matter and receive a better view for the $.<//Review>

<text>We went in with a large group (softball team and parents. I will have to hand it to our waitress there were about 30 of us and she kept up. I think the management should have gave her a little extra help. Food was good and came out hot. But again hats off to our waitress for dealing with a group of that size.< /text>< userid>

Best Italian food ever! Try the early bird dinner, I believe it is from 4 to 6, but check to be sure. If you like Italian cuisine, you will LOVE Vincenzo's.< /text>

The sauce was so good I could've had it as chowder. This place is family owned and operated since 1988, just got new owners but one of their goals is keeping the quality of food high. Definitely will come back!

Better than any Olive Garden too.</review>< pics>

{'time': 1593323505043, 'text': 'Hi Jaamee, We are so sorry you feel this way and hope you give us another chance. It is was a difficult choice for us to eliminate the free bread, but due to Covid the company we purchase the bread from was going to stop production of it altogether and the only way we could get it was to order in bulk for a much larger price. The only other option was to not have it at all and we did not want to do that. We demand of ourselves to keep our portions and quality consistent to what they have been for 32 years and work hard to keep the pricing fair. We do offer lunch and early bird menus Monday-Saturday as well. We are so appreciative of your patronage and really hope to see you again. Thank you also for your feedback.'}</Resp>

Great Italian food in any city. The waitress was very helpful. They ran out of what I ordered and she suggestively sold me the cioppino. It was delicious. I was shocked though when the bill came and it was $45.00 (multiple times any other menu item).< /review>

This place is the best Italian restaurant around. There are a few other local restaurants that serve good Italian food, but I believe this one is the best. Very authentic tasting dishes. Good beer selection from local breweries and a nice wine selection as well. They also make really good homemade desserts. You can literally close your eyes and pick off the menu. Everything is great!</text>

<text>So disappointing..
I used to eat here often since it was the only nearby place for some decent pasta, but the experience today was severely lacking and not up to the standards I previously held for this place. I didn't pay ~$22 for shrimp alfredo just to have only 3 PIECES OF SHRIMP. The worst thing? Having shrimp in it costs way more than chicken, which has a decent amount of chicken pieces.

If I wanted to do a piss-poor job just out of spite, I would do exactly this. (Except I wouldn't, because I'm not an awful being.)

Most disappointing experience at Vicenzo's by far. Terrible..

NOTE: If you're ever curious to try out shrimp alfredo, make sure you tell them to actually give you more than 3 pieces of shrimp. The majority of the dish was just pasta noodles and alfredo sauce tossed in at the bottom of the dish. Otherwise, it is not worth the price.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<text>First time I tried Vincenzo's. I certainly was not wowed. The dressing on the Caesar salad was flavorless. I ordered cannelloni and I was very put off by the pasty texture of the filling. Sauce was decent, but not enough to salvage the dish. My waitress was nice and fairly efficient, but the food was working against her. Very disappointed.<//text><Time>1557626497538< /Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>My wife suggested this after having it at a work luncheon and it did not disappoint! The food was great and the service was prompt and attentive. We will definitely return. According to the daughter of the owner, who works as a server, it started out about 30 years ago as a small deli across the street. After about three years, it turned into a small restaurant and has been expanding ever since. Very cool hidden gem.<//text>< pics>

The food was good but atmosphere lacking. My first impression was before and right after you walk in your bombarded with signs and memos of rules and forms of payment they don't except. Also the staff were having conversations that should be talked about in areas that customers are not. It ruins the atmosphere of the establishment with these and makes me feel like I'm at a truck stop diner than an Italian eatery.< /text>

<Review>This place is so great! I love everything I've ever had. Their gnocchi is the best I've had, and if I want something lighter, I usually go for the penne con cucuza. My husband loves the lasagna, and orders it everytime. Tje bread in the table is to die for! We've been coming here for many years, and will continue to go back for many more years. If toy cant already tell, I highly recommend this restaurant! Dont forgetvto get a piece if chocolate raspberry or sicilan cheesecake before you leave.<//Review>< Date>

This is definitely my favorite restaurant in Lake Elsinore!  Italian food on the West Coast is not like it in in the Northeast (New York - Providence).  But Vincenzo's brings some of that Federal Hill Italian to the area!  LOVE their sausage and peppers.  Their ravioli is fantastic, and the people are wonderful!</text>

<user>104298127216317032244<//user><Time>1575958139168</Time><Review>Food and atmosphere is great but the service was poor. It seems like the service level of the servers has fallen off significantly lately.  Tonight was brutal, waiting too long for initial contact, drinks and refills took forever, salad and dinner came out seconds apart..anytime we needed anything we had to get up to go search for our server. This was especially bad because we were the only party left in the restaurant. Finally, our server messed up our bill, we brought her an extra $20 to settle up and we were told it qas ok they had alreqdy charged for cars for the additional amount..WHAT? Definately wasnt worth the automatic 18% tip they added to our bill. Honestly, the food may bring us back but we will be hoping for service that matches the food.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Yummy Italian food-all fresh/ made from scratch from sauces to gnocchi to breads and desserts- all flavorful and fresh.  My personal favorite is molezane piene (breaded eggplant with ricotta cheese rolled into it). Huge wine list.<//review>

Hidden gem! I can't believe we've never been here before. Everything is good, from the bread and the magical red sauce that you get when you're seated, to the house-made desserts when you're done (and stuffed). The veal marsala is some of the best I've had... I wanted to tilt the plate back and drink it. You can tell that they care about what they do. Great, friendly staff rounds it all off. Go here. Now.</Text>

I want to like this place, in fact I want to love it - but I cant. Both times I have eaten here our server seems over worked, I don't see anyone helping her which creates a very slow experience. On my 3rd visit I couldn't wait  any longer as the family became too impatient to be seated. We were told 5-10 minutes and after 15 were told 5 more minutes, after that we left and went else where. There were two other parties in the resturant and a couple at the bar. Not busy to say the least. I give it 3 stars because the food is very, very good... when you finally get it that is. Otherwise it would be a 1 star experience. The folks seating us usually seem indifferent to guest mostly which should drop them to 1 star. But the ravioli is my favorite and the alfredo is great. I have other choices and must spend my money elsewhere though.< /text>

After playing golf at the Links with my friend he invited me to have dinner at Vincenzo's. I am glad I took him up on the invitation the food and service were outstanding. If you are in the Lake Elsinore area and are hungry and like Italian food go to Vincenzo's.< /text>

< Review>
My wife and I moved to the area 3 weeks ago. We were looking for authentic restaurants near us. We found Vincenzo's olive tree. The food and service was above standard. We simply couldn't believe the quality and quantity we received for the price. We met and talked to Vincenzo about the experience. This is now our chosen restuarant for Sicilian cuisine.

Loved it!<//Review>

A really great experience, great food, great service, family owned and operated, pricing was good. My family has been enjoying Vincenzo's since 1995 and will continue to do so. Thank you again!</Review>

Always a great experience at Vincenzo's. We always go for the early bird specials between 4 and 6. The portions are smaller than dinner but still almost too much food. I love the Vincenzo's special and my wife is crazy about the cannelloni. Always fresh and delicious.<//review>

We we're very disappointed, with our whole ordeal. The hoastist has ne personality at all, our waitress was very unatentavive or distracted, our food was so so, not sure what kind of meat was in our minestrone soup,  the salad was not fresh,the lasagna was hot but reminded us of a frozen take n bake. Not sure how this restaurant has received such high ratings unless Lake Elsinore Residents have no other Italian Restaurant to compare too< /text>

I came in with my son for take out the host was perfect very prrofessional. My son had to go to the bathroom. I notice what seemed like a workers family dinner when we got back from the bathroom a guy in what seems to be a auto mechanic shirt followed usback tothe front and said whats i noded and said whats up. The feeling i got they didnt want african american in the restaurant. I think the gentleman was related to the owners. I got my food and left will not eat thier again. 2019 stop the racism and profiling i am a professional physician . but the host was awesome.< /review>

This Italian restaurant is the best in or around Lake Elsinore. My go to order is the eggplant parmesan with minestrone as the starter, but recently I tried the sausage, mushroom and eggplant dish served over pasta (I can't remember what it was called) and was quite pleased.

Vincenzo is usually around to make sure that everything is enjoyable and that people are having a good time. This is a great local place to have lunch or dinner.</Text>

I can't believe I've lived in the area for 20+ years and never tried them till last week .they have great staff and an awesome fettuccini Alfredo with chicken which is my favorite. But a most tasty marinara sauce that they give with the bread. Wow. I'm going for lunch today .</review>

This was a wonderful dining experience. We have been to Rome and Venice and the cooking here is very much like we got there. Our server was excellent and the owner and his wife were a pleasure! Love the accent, very Sicilian!<//review>

Everything about this place is on point. Ambiance is very nice. Food absolutely delicious. I had the Creamy garlic marinera penne pasta. Came with soup or salad, I had salad with ranch, it was very good, & garlic bread. Our server was excellent, & I loved her accent. I will most definitely be returning to Vincenzo's & have already recommended it to friends. 🥖🍷🍽❤< /text>

Tonight's service, food presentation, etc I'm downgrading my experience from a 5 to a 2.

After asking about vegetarian selections BUT was served minestrone and then vegetable soup BOTH with meat added to it.

And then the salad, it took two times to get that right.

By the time the appetizer came with no appetizer plates I was ready to leave.

Tonight was definitely not the experience we normally enjoy.< /text>

It was really a phylly cheese steak. Also the calamari was smelling a bit too fishy for my liking. The ministrone soup was excellent, the tomato meatballs sub and the eggplant parmesan also.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The place felt a bit outdated in it's designed. The air vents on the cieling got me headache as the light was just above them and my table was blinking as the vent worked.
The food was ok, some dishes were nice, some were okay (too oil, too.kuch cheese).
Price was reasonable...< /review><Response>None<//Response>< user_name>

Vincenzos is a lovely, long established full service Italian restaurant. Family owned, great, great food and portions a woman like me cannot finish in one seating. The service is wonderful, they are truly attentive and caring. I know they've been here for many years. I moved to Menifee in 2005 and have been there many delicious times. Thanks Vincenzo's. Don't change!</text>

<Text>I’m only 13 and a full Italian although it could never beat my grandmothers cooking it is definitely right underneath her cooking which shows how good and how their food actually taste like true home cooked Italian food...amazing service and great staff very nice people....for dessert I highly recommend spumoni which is the best I’ve ever had.<//Text><Name>Madeline M</Name><Date>1530562187522< /Date><rate>5< /rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>112429234901086982494</user_id><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc9bb8af0ad2e5:0xf43ee469057e9c92<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I really like this place. The music was really good we came on may 2nd 2015 and the man singing was incredibly sweet I didn't get his name.  Also we met the owner who was really nice as well. The staff is great and the food is superb you must try it out.< /review>

The chicken parmigiana was fantastic, the cocktails are tasty, the staff is friendly and all the servers are helpful, even if they aren't serving your table. The restaurant is small and there will be a wait at dinner time.</text>< pics>

We had a larger group waited for them to get a table "ready " there wasnt even enough silverware on the table. As i watched them get another table ready i realized we were suppose to get bread and plates and silverware. Also our sever was slightly rude and seemed annoyed that we were even there. Took forever to get our food.  Might have just been our server but we wont be back.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Atmosphere is great. The main course dinners  that my friends had looked and apparently tasted great. However, I had their pizza. It looked delicious and the toppings were good, but the pizza dough was tasteless and hard as a brick making this the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  I will go again, but not for pizza.< /Text>

<text>Consistently excellent italian cuisine. Superb service with smiling attentive servers. Moderate prices are a deal when considering the quality and quantity of food they purchase. A full bar is available. Delicious italian desserts are also offered. My mother is full italian and loves this place. I've sampled many italian restaurants and found them to be sorely lacking in authenticity and simple good taste. Give Vicenzo's a try. You will be content, happy, and sated.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dc9bb8af0ad2e5:0xf43ee469057e9c92</gmap_id></record>

< review>
Just so so. Not great by any means. Not sure I understand the hype. It's Italian by name and by menu, but the quality screams Denny's. I paid $22 for some alfredo with (5) shrimp on it. And while the alfredo sauce definitely didn't come from a can, it quickly broke down into a puddle of grease at the bottom of my bowl. Also, the shrimp was previously frozen. The quality doesn't match the price one bit.

The service was very slow for a Thursday night. The restaurant was not at capacity and was well staffed. Still, our order came out after two other tables which larger groups that had ordered after us.

Maybe it was the food we ordered, maybe it was just us, maybe it was one of those so-called "off nights" for the restaurant, in any case we won't be back.</review>

<text>Absolutely Forgettable! Pasta not very flavorful & overwhelmed with sauce. & The kids pizza was a garlic bread topped with marinara & cheese, it's not real pizza! The wine was not served correctly. The atmosphere was outdated and service was mediocre at best.

The only thing I enjoyed was the tiramisu.< /text>< pics>

< review>
An Italian-American surprise in a small town strip mall.   In town for some meetings and chose this place based off of its menu which indicated a few items were homemade.  I had the Sausage Miramonte (thick cut true Italian sausage, breaded eggplant... which was kind of soggy, fresh button mushrooms and an amazing fresh light red sauce); it came with a truly garlicy slice of bread, and a side salad with real anchovies.  So good. My server Katie was on top of it.   Pros+ good recipes, reasonable costs (most meals $13-18; early bird stuff about $10). Cons- Fake flower vases at table downgrade the restaurant, offer some fresh ground pepper on a true salad and pasta, vacant outdoor patio made it look like the place wasn't even open.<//review>

< review>
Absolutely horrible!

We arrived during lunch and were seated.  Unfortunately, we waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  During that time one of the waitresses and managers walked past us several times, while we heard them bicker over who would take care of us.

Ordered our meal, but watched it sit in the window for 10 minutes before it arrived luke warm.  A waitress refused to deliver it as she was rolling silver and it wasn't her table.  Apparently there is a personal greivance between staff.

The food quality was ridiculous.  One meal tasted like a Lean Cuisine, the other like Beef Stroganoff.  In short, horrible.

Wanted to inform someone that cared, but unfortunately the owners also perform a magic act, in which they vanished into thin-air...

Fortunately, this was my one and only visit.  Do yourself a favor.... Visit Stater Bros, buy a TV dinner and a beer for $5.  You'll be better off.< /review>

Had to go to the emergency room tonight because the owner did not listen to a thing we told him about our food allergies .   They actually made me pay a bill for food that was never touched before they would let the paramedics leave with us.  Do not eat here.  All they want is their money and do not care about their customer's health< /Text>
