I've never actually visited this place in person but my coffee arrives at the perfect temperature (every time) and my bagel sandwich never lasts long :)</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Very accommodating staves and affordable coffee are in this coffee shop! A week ago, I came here to try your coffee and muffins. I was feeling delighted when your staff served my order quickly. Five stars for the excellent service! You expect me to recommend your coffee shop to everyone! Thanks much!< /review>

Coffee lovers should try to visit this shop! Yesterday, I came here to relax and plan for my next projects. I was so happy and satisfied with the service of your staves because they were so active and friendly. The taste of the coffee and desserts were so tasty, and it impressed me much. Thanks much, guys! You're strongly recommended!<//review>

<review>The drinks are hot and fresh. The service is gracious and friendly. It would be nice if they had better music choice. I was there in the morning and there was a radio show that was mildly annoying. Would've rather heard some steady upbeat grooves at that hour. I'll go back again.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I had black iced tea and peanutbutter cookie.
Tea was not bitter or sweetened so I loved it. The cookie was a little dry but tasty!
The place could use a little work inside the hall and bathroom. It was dirty.
Service from a blue haired woman was great. I would come back but its not my first choice.< /review>

Had one of the worst customer service experiences that I had to write review.
The cashier/guy that took my order was rude. It seemed that everything about speaking, taking my order frustrated him. He didn't smile, and when he finally brought my food I said " Thank you" all I got was a "uh huh" . Very disappointed as I love their rox lox bagels.<//review>

I went in for a bite to eat, and asked for hot water to drink. The owner refused to provide hot water, insisting that I purchase a drink.  She said "Why I give you hot water? What is in it for me?" I have been frequenting this place since it opened. I usually get bagel with cream cheese and tea, or avocado toast. I will not be going back.< /review>

<Response>None</Response><review>Honestly, this is one of the best coffee shops in Long Beach-  they have cool treats that are ethnic (Russian or middle eastern), fresh brewed coffee, they even have a cold drip coffee with minimum acidity and highest caffeine. They have THE BEST PANINIS - I love their vegan one with avocado and pesto!< /review>< rate>

Got a pumpkin spice frap which ended up having no flavor and not blended with three visible layers of liquid, blended ice and foam. Also got a strawberry smoothie which tasted like watered down strawberry milk. The last drink was a iced vanilla latte which they messed up twice the first having no flavor and the second being straight syrup. Terrible experience.< /Review>

Great single origin light roast coffees, best in Long Beach.Lots of paintings, pictures on the walls. Delicious sandwiches with smoked salmon, smoked turkey, prosciutto, or avocado. Cozy ambiance, warm baristas.Besides, the prices are very attractive.</Review>

<Text>Sad this place was so bad. We are walking distance and would have gone frequently. They had 2 overwhelmed girls working and they were doing their best but ownership set them up to fail. Definitely needed another person helping.  Almost 40 minutes to get a panini sandwich. Once arrived it was 90% pesto and the bread was hard. Everything is overpriced. For 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks we paid $28! Great location... Needs new management.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

It's still new, coffee ☕ is not bad. Service is ok. Will try it out a few more times and post an update later. This location has gone through about 4 coffee shops in 7 years.

So far this is becoming my new favorite coffee shop in long beach.<//Text>< Pics>

We've taken several if our cars to Bobby's. And have always had a very good experience. They have been honest, no nonsense and hard working. I can say I trust their evaluations.< /review>

<text>Bobby's Smog & Auto Repair, truly helped me today! My car was barely running, and no one could figure out what was wrong for weeks. A friend from work recommended I call Bobby. I brought the car into his shop, an hour later after running a diagnostic, he called with the problem. It was repaired an hour after that! I was not over charged, or manipulated like some shops will do to women! If that wasn't enough, my hood latch was not latching correctly, so Bobby had me pull into a bay on my way out the door, and he repaired that, for free! When does that happen! Amazing repair shop, with an even more amazing owner! I would send my mother to them!< /text>< date>

Bobby and Kevin are who we usually get service from, that are honest and fast. My inlaws have been coming here for years, there isnt a better mechanic.  Something happens with our car, these guys help. Just love the welcoming friendly services< /review>

Best Auto Repair Shop in town. Bobby treats you with respect and dignity. He is not one to take you to the cleaners. Tells you what you need and get the job done. So if you like GREAT quality work you better shop there first. Thank You Bobby and Katie you are super people.</Review>

Came here today at bobbies smog 2/22/16 ...  I took my Honda in to get worked on smog / and a dianostic test , but once I told him my car was low he said.              " I hate low cars,  who recommended you to me ? But I'll do it , I hate low cars "   He tried to grab my paper work in my hand to  see who recommended me to him but I took my papers back before he got them , he said he'll work on my car , but his winney crying attitude pushed me out the door with my  $800.00 - .  People who cry about working on a car will do anything to fix a repair 20%  and not a 100%  .....  I wonder if that's why his shop was empty of customers .. lil cry baby,  if he's reading this grow up and take your job serious. Work with the customers don't cry about your work or what kinda car your working on ,  after all working on cars and customers  pay your bills ,<//Text>

I had my order set for a later time to be picked up. unfortunately the time requested to pick up was no longer in my favor so I had called to see if I can have the cake done sooner and was very pleased that they were able to help me. The cake came out delicious And had no problem picking up my order.< /Review>

This place has very photogenic desserts. Love taking pictures here. The desserts itself is quite  good. My favorite was the tiramisu, both of the tiramisu is really great. The place is self-service, I see a lot of Koreans at this place as it takes place in K-town. The place is pretty tight, but it seems okay.< /review>

<text>I hadn't been to this Baskin-Robbins in years, I used to go here quite a bit to order ice cream cakes and get ice cream, there have been a few different owners. At one time, I was told I couldn't park in front of the store in the empty parking lot, which I have heard has now changed. Although friendly staff is there, I think their policy about ice cream cake orders, in particular flavor changes is ridiculous. If you are paying for an ice cream cake, you should be able to pick the ice cream flavor since it has to be made. I was told I had to pay an additional fee for getting strawberry ice cream. How can you insist a person select from three different flavors only for Mother's Day cakes if they all have to be made?!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

A ton of great variety every day and all the employees do their absolute best to accommodate their customers. In particular one girl, claudia Carrillo, is always helping people! Really satisfied with the service here and impressed by the food. I've been everywhere and several colleges, never before have I seen dedication like this💯💯💯</review>

Good food but expensive. They don't have a lot of vegetarian options. The beyond burger is really amazing. Some of their pizza is good too. If you want to play it safe, take something from salad bar, it's always very good.<//review>

The only reason I still eat there is because getting food anywhere else is either unfeasible with limited transportation or astronomically expensive elsewhere on campus. I have some serious health concerns about this place. Mold in some of the food served, flies baked into the muffins. The school won't even do anything because they're trying to cut their losses with the big 2020 project. Ever since it became all you can eat, whatever quality they had before declined further. Don't even get me started on how many students suffer in the bathroom after having a single meal there. It's abhorrent and needs to change.<//text>

Must be charging so much for the food  to pay for salt. The only "safe" options for food is a sandwich which has been messed up before. It's a nice new building with plenty of seats but don't let looks deceive you.< /Review>< GmapID>

I'm not a picky eater, but the food here is pretty bad. The quality and variety of food from the old dining center in the Yablokoff-Wallace building was much better than this. If you're just visiting the campus and don't need to worry about maxing out a meal plan, I recommend eating from the YW DC or a food truck instead.<//text>

Going here ruined my love for pizza and I don't recommened it breakfast is mediocre with tiny as pancakes hashbrowns powder egg and the same drink juice or soda. This place has made me gain 15 pounds I don't recommened going here unless you vegan because if you are you atleast get access to a buffet of salads and many side its almost like it favor them if your an omnivore your better off going someonewhere else and if your forced to buy a plan get the 11 trust me you saving alot of money in the long run .< /Text>< userid>

<text>Wayy too overpriced for the same bland food. A pound of cantaloupe sets you back almost 7 dollars, and they purposefully overweigh it by adding a heavier plate. Menus never change for the restraunts, so after a couple weeks of eating chicken tenders and fries every day you might understand why UC students hate the Pavillion. But yeah, let's let the chancellor walk away with 6 figures.

Edit 1- UCM moved from meal plan to meal swipes. I am no longer a regular, as I live off campus now, but have paid the crazy 18$ dinner fee a few times when I was not in the mood to cook or drive somewhere. The food is the same boring stuff, although I have heard that there have been some good items on the menu occasionally. They added curly fries every once in a while, which were very good, for what they were.

At the end of the day still not worth it at all to me, but if you have nothing else, it's there. And you can eat as much as you want. Beats the scam that is the Los Reyes food truck.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>David Murillo< /user_name><Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>1<//Rate>< gmap_id>

I had visit this place on December/27/2020.
Spoony me.....I was looking for the garden with a lot of flowers but after about 1.5 miles hiking in, and I found out....
The name Garden of Eden is a misnomer.
There is no garden but a beautiful forest and scenery river flowing through it.
It was a bit confusing because no sign board or gate.
It is a small pool and boulders, very awesome spot if you love water holes.
The hike along the train tracks is lovely and a lot of fun. 99 percent of the trail is shaded,super easy, and not many people.
Wish I had gone when it was warmer to enjoy swimming!
It’s totally worth the effort.<//Review>

If you're expecting a calm and serene vista (like the name "garden of eden" would suggest), then this is probably not it. What this actually is is a pretty crowded swimming hole, usually filled with music, alcohol, and weed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if that's what you want, but just be prepared a fairly crowded teen hangout. The walk there involves some steep hills and some walking along the train tracks to get to the only real place you can get down to the river<//review>

<review>Probably one of the best hikes in the area. It is very well know and in effect there is quite a bit of trash and even some spray paint tagging which is unfortunate. There is a place to rope swing or jump from both of which are against the rules. The best way to get there is to park on the 9 or the train tracks if you are coming from campus< /review>< gmapID>

Awesome spot to go hang out on a hot day. Gets crowded on hot holidays but nothing too excessive. Be careful of having alcohol out if you see rangers roll by. Have seen people get citations before.</Text>

I'll never get used to the lax vibes and beautiful scenery that this spot offers. Be careful, though, the park rangers do come by around noontime and check for alcoholic beverages, glass bottles, and dogs on the beach and they WILL ticket you ($300+).</Review>

<Review>The flow can be a bit pushy and might drag you on to the underwater rocks. Wear sandals or some footwear, otherwise pretty challenging and painful. Pack your trash with you. From ox road is the shortest distance down to the water. Gets crowded, but you can move along the banks. Water is cold.<//Review>< time>

<review>WARNING! DONT GO TO THIS PARK ON LYFT OR UBER IF YOU ARE A TOURIST OR NEW TO THIS PARK. No internet connection on Hwy 9 and if on foot there is no walking trail to go back into town. The  road is thin only space for cars and dangerous and no space to go on foot. YOU WILL GET STranded with wild life. If you go take your car so you exit out alive and safe as the road are only meant for cars and bikes. The park is beautiful but dangerous in this sense.</review><date>1596332164769<//date>< gmap_id>

The San Lorenzo river is very dirty. Trash is everywhere. Crowded all day everyday from march to november. Every year people disregard the rules and get too drunk or dive off the rocks and have to get airlifted out of the valley. Stick to the beaches east of cowells that are more sheltered from the wind (sunny cove, etc.) if you want a nice summertime spot to jump in the water.<//Text>

Google maps seemed to suggest walking along the roadway from where you park to where you can access the trail, but this is unreasonably dangerous and unnecessary; there's a trail and fire road from the parking area that leads down to the rail road and creek below. Walking along the side of highway 9 is not needed.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>The name Garden of Eden is a misnomer, and you are in for a surprise. There is no garden but a beautiful forest with a calm river flowing through it.

We had a bit of confusion with the entrance as we drioe through redwoods. There is no gate or any sign board, but there is an area where you can park the car. We assumed that is the entrance and thought of checking it out. There is no other sign even when you enter and no info about the trail. We kept on walking with an assumption that it will lead to the river. And it did.! We go through the hill in a winding downhill trail to reach near the river. The trail continues parallel to the river and there are a few spots that you can access the river.

We went around 4-5 pm, and it gets pretty dark due to the tree cover. There were some families spending time with the kids, and enjoying bathing in the river.

We spent only less than an hour, and am sure there was more to hike and see. Since there was no other information about the trail, am not sure how long it is. We returned after we spent some time in the river. The uphill hike was a lot more tiring, but it was worth.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Review>When not crowded clear water 2- 15 ft deep, some rapids, small waterfalls. Fun swim area. Sandy beach with some med size boulders.  15 min. Walk from Hwy 9 . Nudity not much of an option on weekends. Leave the dogs and beer bottles at home. Avoid jumping off cliffs, it's a misdemeanor ticket and could get you killed. Tranquil peaceful place. Pack in pack out.  Pretty college gals make it a treat.< /Review>< Pics>

A nice spot to go for a swim. It's close to a lot of good hiking trails and the distinctive old railroad bridge. The biggest downside (as others have pointed out) is that it can get very crowded and many of the people who go are disrespectful to the natural beauty of the place, so if you go PLEASE pick up after yourself.

While this isn't my favorite place on the San Lorenzo, it's worth going to.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I'm a volunteer for the park, and for the past 12 years I've taken on the task of keeping the Garden of Eden a Garden. And let me tell you, it's a full time job, especially on summer weekends, when hundreds of people come to enjoy it. So here's the deal: no dogs, no fires, no alcohol, leave no trash, out by sunset. And if you think it's okay to ignore the rules, you are likely to run into a park ranger ready to write you a ticket--minimum $300 fine. Please, please come and enjoy the Garden, but it's not a party spot. It's a place for peaceful reflection and reverence of the beauty we find in the natural world.
So many dogs! Even if you pick up after your dog, their paws on dirt leave a scent that scares local wildlife. Please come and visit the Garden, but please don't bring your dog. Instead, walk the paved Pipeline Road for 4 miles, where dogs are allowed. And no dogs ever in the river.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The park as a whole is five stars so this review is strictly for the once “garden of eden”. It’s a very large river and locals know where to go .... not there. Definitely avoid this place but if you have to know where it is or you have to see it once to check it out and say hi to all the tourists sharing your 2 square feet of sand by golly go ahead.   But watch out for...whatever tourist leave.</Review></record>

Unfortunately, due to the high volume of visitors the beauty of the Garden of Eden is the same as it once was.

When going to any public park, it should be common sense to not disregard signs that tell you "no alcoholic beverages are permitted beyond this point." Or "pick up your trash." Instead, that's what has happened at the Garden of Eden over the past few years. Last year, someone died here.

If you do go, please do your part to preserve - pack out all trash, including your feces.</Review>

Very popular swimming hole near Felton.  Easy walk in from the Highway 9 parking area.  No dogs or alcohol, fishing is permitted but mainly minnows with an occasional adult in the deeper holes.  Also seasonal Coho & Steelhead Salmon runs with the proper fishing report cards.<//review>

It is quite a hike to get to the garden. So if you head there be prepared for hike and very narrow road. To get out its about 5+ miles on curvy narrow one lane road going up hills.</Review>

Amazing spot if you know the way to get there. Very easy walk to the trail head which is married by a no alcoholic beverages sign along the train tracks. Follow the train tracks and you will find it.</Text>

Beautiful spot, plenty of smaller patches of beach and open space to hang out, and a big area in case you like crowds.  The very short hike there is an awesome start to the day, too.<//text>

<time>1537994895306<//time><Text>Too many people know about this spot now so it's pretty much ruined now. Wouldn't want to call it the garden of eden anymore. More of a public swimming hole people go to party,have sex, pollute the once beautiful area more with fresh that is never taken back where it came from cause apparently it's too difficult for people to keep things clean and leave no trace... sess pool of tourists... I'm glad I got my fill before there was never any parking and before it got ruined with disgusting trash(condoms, glass bottles,cans etc) from the  rejects who now inhabit the area. Ain't a beautiful secret spot in the woods to go swimming in anymore! Fyi that water isn't really meant to be swam in either... I just dipped my feet in. Its toilet water ruin off from all the self valley people who have septic instead of sewers ;)</Text></record>

Hundreds of people leaving their trash, beer bottles, and toilet paper everywhere. Screaming Little kids peeing (and pooping) in the water. Drunken idiots jumping off rocks and hurting themselves. Gang graffiti on trees. Too many cars trying to park on a winding mountain road. If you want to ruin something beautiful post directions on the internet.</Text>

<Time>1611288951570<//Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>This place is incredible! It's a Trader Joe's, Ralph's, Whole Foods, mini Costco, and ethnic market all packaged into one convenient, not-too-big store that also let's you pick up and return your Amazon packages. It's perfect! Easy to get in and out of. Pleasant staff and they have Alexa stations throughout the store. It's clean, ample, with 4 different types of shopping carts: a small, a large, one one for the kids, and the self checkout. This store is so well thought out, it makes grocery shopping pleasurable again. Can't wait to go back.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmsl2-L3SaF9m4G5ZCmbOuMwIHRhavgwXzHWrh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnGQ9T8lhPJCEEKwWpQksBp1SwHvlD-DwCqkCd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTSN9A9Chli-40UYXWhbLfMWh4CJuTyG8nx_JF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfLaHfcYil2vHSxAR4qkKnQHxPOta1GeqU2KJ4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvKUPlGvQJ-QCDYdYFTdl_BsH7xbYY7bTSqFaQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYElQ0tzmPpB4hqaMolg4Gcr0YABB6po4hiA_u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

What a fantastic shopping experience. Well stocked shelves, quality fresh meats and produce and I loved those high tech shopping carts. That was amazing. They're making fresh pizza in the back folks, for $1.79 per slice. Didn't taste it, but I love the concept. My new favorite store.</review>

<review>This is going to be my go to place when I need the frequently used grocery items like eggs, butter, milk, baby formula, etc.
It's Very clean. Employees are very nice. Easy to find things and check out was super fast.
The only caveat is they don't have a huge variety of soda and I suspect there are a few other catagories where they limit the selection to just the most popular choices. So doesn't replace my usual grocery store completely.
Overall, it's great way to pick up the essentials.</review><rate>5</rate>< user>

Clean and bright atmosphere. Lots of fresh veggies and fruit. Meat department is vell stocked with some great cuts. Not many specialty items in the grocery area. Pretty basic. The Dash cart option is pretty cool. My only complaint would be the checkout line... only one cashier and the line got pretty long.</text>

I had a delightful experience at this new store. The store is clean. And, the customer service is outstanding. For example, I asked an employee where is the bread. She stopped what she was doing and took us to the bread aisle. There are some innovations to the grocery shopping experience too. They have technology-enhanced shopping carts they call dash carts. It totals up what you put in the cart as you shop. It's like self-service check out on steroids. I love the way Amazon has placed a cashier display facing the consumer. It's easier to see and stay on budget. I love the fact that they have biodegradable paper shopping bags. The thing I love most about this shopping experience is the fact that all the employees have good morale, are friendly, and accurately reflect the ethnic diversity of the neighborhood. Everyone I asked if they like working there said, Yes!< /Text>

We are not from the area so it was our first time visiting an Amazon store.  We tried out the "Dash" cart, the one that gets tied to your Amazon account and automatically tracks/charges you for what you put in the cart.

The staff gave us a tutorial of how to use it, and it was quick and easy. The cart functioned flawlessly and checkout was a breeze.

Prices at this location seemed really high, not sure if that's an LA thing or an "Amazon Fresh" thing but a pack of gum and 2 cucumbers ran us $9.65 which seemed awfully high.

Anyway, we came here for the experience and were not dissapointed!</text>

When you go inside they give you a ‘smart’ cart with some brown bags already placed inside it. All you need to do is scan the QR code with your phone and you’re good to go.
Throw stuff in the bags and the cart lights up to acknowledge you have placed something in. Have a look at the screen attached to the cart and you’ll see it’s already been added to your virtual cart. Even the produce is easy to deal with. Just put in the code and place the produce in the cart. It has a scale built into it and it will tell you how much is weights and how much that’ll cost. Just takes a second to register it so don’t move your cart until it’s finished.
Once you’re done with your shop have a look at your tablet and you’ll know how much you’re going to pay. Walk through the check out where all you’ll have to do is pick up your brown bags from the cart and walk out the shop. It’s that easy. Receipt gets sent to your Amazon app and email.
It’s very cool idea and ill definitely go back. Overall it has some good products but I wouldn’t say it has as many options as your Ralph’s and Vons. Just the start though so I’m sure they’ll start to carry more and more.
I say it’s good for a quick $20-$50 shop. I wouldn’t go there to buy all my groceries for the week.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
This Amazon fresh is newly opened. The shopping experience was great. I used the new carts that scan items as you out them in the cart. It was fast and easy and if items scanned twice it was an easy fix. The interface on the screen is easy to understand and check out was easy. If you need more bags you grab them and your amazon primary card is automatically charged. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is due to the prices. I do quite alot of shopping and some of their items are cheaper at other stores. All in all a good experience but I will probably only shop here when I'm looking for better quality specific items I can't find at my local grocery store.< /Review>

< Review>
I went to Amazon Fresh a couple of weeks ago. It's nice and clean. You have to shop smart... there are somethings that are higher than Ralph's and Food For Less. I was impressed with the food in the deli and bistro section.... food was fresh and nice looking.<//Review>

I love the staff at this store. They are all professional and welcoming. Great Job Everyone!!! 👍🏼< /review>

<Review>This is a fantastic place to do your grocery shopping! They have nonchemical and chemical-free connoisseur treats, as well as something in the center. The foods, as well as some of the items, are fantastic. After having a look at this store, you'll think twice about eating out all of the time and instead use your kitchen appliances. I'll definitely return the next time I'm in town.< /Review>< pictures>

The meats are top-notch and such any kind of produce. Roaming through this shop will make you think twice about eating out all the time and make use of your appliances. Exceptional grocery shop! If you are into connoisseur foods, nonchemical or anything in between, they have it.  I will surely come back next time. A highly recommendable place to shop for your foods!<//Review>

Been here twice and it’s been amazing. Outstanding customer service and everyone is so friendly. Really good prices... in my opinion in certain stuff they have the best prices. And they have a small bakery area along with a hot food area. Pizza slices are 1.79 I believe. I’ve also gotten a 10 dollars off coupon when you spend 35+! :) my new favorite place. I’ll definitely be coming back more often</review>

As the store is new, they are still working through product stocking and product selection. Prices are variable, great on some things, high on others. Usually not busy, in fact usually more employees than customers. Convenient Amazon pick up and returns inside. Lots of parking.<//text>

Nice clean store. Lousy employees, well some of them. They walk by you and don't/won't greet you. Almost run into you and not say excuse me. Not a similar experience compared to the other two stores, Canoga Park and North Hollywood.< /text>

Cool concept once you get the hang of it and Amazon works out the kinks. You can either check out with a cashier or through dash. Dash is definitely more time consuming tho and, you still have to go through a human basket evaluater so you're really not "dashing" anywhere. In the end I appreciated the guy for checking because I'd been charged several times for some of my items.<//Text>

Clean and nicely layout store. I was expecting the prices to resemble a budget grocery store. But it's just bellow whole foods (whole check) prices. For these prices I rather go to Vons. The take and bake salmon is a great value though, might return just for the salmon.<//text>

I love the fact that I can grocery shop and pick up my packages.  The store is beautiful and staff are super friendly.  Huge slices of pizza for less than $1.50.  They have a phenomenal curry chicken salad (yum!). Welcome addition to the neighborhood.</review>

It's a mix of Sprouts (for the fresh products) and Target. It looks like a big grey and green warehouse that was turned into a grocery store. I don't know if it's because of the lighting or the too many choices, I got tired of looking around. It has a small fish section with not many choices. I liked the section for ready to eat meals, though it was almost empty. Their chicken was less expensive than Sprouts' or even Costco's but I didn't buy one so I don't know if it tastes just as good. They have some European products like rilletes, paté and a small selection of cheese (wish they could expand that section). Otherwise they have a really friendly staff. Now that I know which products they carry, next time I will order online and just go and pick up :)< /review>

Better than I expected.. Very Very good selection of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, wine, beer & beverages.. Hot & Cold foods as well. Prices are competitive, however the customer service and staff availability was unmatched. Very great place to shop...</Text>

<Name>David Sun</Name><Text>Very clean and modern. The selection is not bad either but their pre-made fried chicken was raw. Not sure if I just got a bad batch but I would avoid that. The self checkout shopping cart is cool to use but the cart itself is really small so if you need to get a lot of things, I would opt for the regular cart. Employees were very friendly and helpful.< /Text><pics>None</pics><gmap_id>0x80c2b7c827aefeb3:0xe41b1b2de32b1c3b<//gmap_id>< userid>

<Review>I really enjoyed this store. Went for vitamins and because of the large selection I needed a vitamin "sherpa". I found mine in Chastity. Chastity made my trip to Amazon Fresh delightful. Go, find your sherpa and enjoy the people and the experience as well as the food.< /Review><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b7c827aefeb3:0xe41b1b2de32b1c3b</gmap_id>< pictures>

Came here after 9pm with less than an hour before the store closes and the place was nearly empty. I think I saw 5 people at most and probably an equal amount of employees. They don’t accept Apple Pay so next time I might just do express lane with self check out. They scan your ID when buying alcohol which is the first time that has ever happened so I wonder how that works with self check out express lane. I’ll try that out next time. I took one star off because I saw an employee who was wearing their mask below their nose. That’s not acceptable when it’s been a year since covid started.</text>

<Review>It is terrifying that Amazon is becoming a monopoly, but I can also see why they are. They have figured out that we're lazy and impatient and want things quick and easy, and they cater to that perfectly.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

What a Great experience, from the young lady Allie, outside who was assisting with the carts while we waited outside for social distancing, she was so helpful explaining the process to inside using the cart where you place your items in the cart and it automatically scans it, all employees were real nice and helpful, and we had the pleasure of Allie checking my mom out, its employees like this that make you want to go back to a store, my checkout,  was a breeze, you just push your cart in the designated area and it checks you out, Loved this store, will definitely go back and my  favorite right next door Chick a Fill.<//review>

People know how much I despise Bezos, but the people he hires are amazing.  I should know.  I was one of them.  Haha.  Seriously though, the folks who work here are off the charts nice and “service focused.”   I used to work for a supermarket that was the predecessor to Whole Foods and we definitely were not motivated to care.  These folks seem to be and make the experience great!<//Review>

It's nice market, the insta cart is still in "beta" cuz it's pretty buggy. But the killer, the one thing that this store is really bad at is prices. They most certainly are not trying to complete and If they had the shelvs stocked with stuff that you can't find anywhere near here they could have maybe gotten away with it but they don't. My mom is into the Keto diet and we couldn't find a thing there that was keto. Me personally I couldn't find a thing there that Ralph's didn't have at a lower price with any special member pricing or coupons. Amazon fresh was just more expensive across the board.</Text>

I came here for my knee surgery they definitely had safety protocols in place and did a temperature check. Once in i went to check in  then I was called back. My nurse who I swear I can't remember her name was very patient and attentive with me until I got called back,  the physical therapist was very patient with me as well while we were going through some exercises before I got released.</Text>

Nurses and staff are great! Came in early in the morning for labor nurses and security guard that were at the front were super helpful and nice. Labor and delivery nurses were great as well all made sure we had everything we needed and were helpful in every step of the way! Would definitely recommend!</Review>

Worst Kaiser center , rude staff and nurse . Long waiting , I tried my second dose through kaiser long waiting , completely unplanned center . I took my first dose in san francisco 100 of people ,they managed very well and got vaccine less than 10 minutes, here for 25 people more than one hrs of waiting .I will never go to this center again. I really doubt people get covid from this location due to such unplanned crowd.  Advice to management please learn how to manage crowd and respect others time. My big mistake to decide my second dose via Kaiser Antioch</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Worst Kaiser that I have ever been too. The nurses and staff are very rude. The security guards act like you are doing something wrong when you are there for legitimate reasons. If you can, go to the Kaiser hospital in Walnut Creek. I’ve always received five star service from them. Never again will I go back to Antioch/Brentwood Kaiser. That hospital needs a complete overhaul. Nurses and staff are idiots!</Review>< pics>

<Text>Was here helping the wife with some surgery she had to get taken care of. All the nurses and Doctors were friendly and helpful when asked things.

Waiting chairs could use some help as they are flat and not too comfy.

Place had a  live pianist so there was pleasant music rather than canned muzak.</Text>< pictures>

So overly disappointed in the poor quality of care that is being given. My daughter was sent to the hospital via ambulance for pelvic and abdominal pain. Watching her scream in excruciating pain broke my heart, watching her pass out was scary. The fire department and ambulance quickly came to her aide and stated something is not right. Since I couldn't go with her I told her to call and keep me posted. The EMT gave her a shot of something because of the pain. Once she was dropped off the staff at Kaiser sat my sick daughter who passed out and that was in pain in a waiting room in a chair. Where she was screaming because it was painful to sit up.  I picked her up and took her to John Muir where she was suffering from TSS and could have died and also a pelvic condition that required surgery. I haveNever in my life seen such horrible patient care. If you need real emergency medical care don't go here... You may walk in and never walk out.
I will be contacting a lawyer.< /Text>

Staff is cool with the exception of a couple neglectful MDs but most hospitals have those. What im here to complain about today is the absolute bonkers status of the labs. No matter what time of day I go in to get blood drawn, there is a 2 hour wait....just to get blood drawn. There isn't even a option to view what numbers they are calling out, you HAVE to sit there infront of that blue and pink screen and wait 2+ hours to even be seen to sign in. Ridiculous!<//text>

I am a Kaiser member  and Kaiser Employee and had a really bad service experience from This facility!
My mother in-law got discharge from open heart surgery from without any instructions, follow up from a Doctor, no PT no OT that called us. My mother in law needed an oxygen tank, walker and others but we have to reach out to the social worker and other personnel to ask all of this and up to this moment no one called.<//Text>

<Text>Advise nurse told me to come in the emergency room ASAP because I had an asthma attack with no inhaler. and said to tell the front desk that I have breathing issues, no inhaler and had an asthma attack. The front lady said to take a seat the nurse will call me in a few minutes. It’s been 30+ minutes. I can currently barely breathe correctly as I’m typing this. Do I have to faint or die in front of them to get immediate treatment??? Then I listened to the lady say “take a seat the nurse will be w you in a few mins” to every person after me. But I mean hey, what can you expect from an “emergency” hospital in Antioch right? Wouldn’t trust them with my life. Is it possible to sue?<//Text><user>100574120584816373490</user>< gmapID>

People here are very attentive and building is kept very clean it tends to get packed sometimes. I rarely go to the pharmacy here during day,seems slower and often too busy. they are the only one that I know of that has a 24-hour pharmacy which is wonderful. This Kaiser also offers all kinds of neat classes from yoga to Zumba and other aerobics, over all a great Kaiser.< /Review>

<Text>Went to the ER last night. Cuz I dont have insurance, the doctor didn't want to do any tests or really look at me. Told him I was coughing up blood and have been coughing for 2 weeks. His exact words where "its maybe viral, I can prescribe u antibiotics" then I got sent home. I was choking pretty bad. He could have at the least gave me a breathing treatment or something. If this turns out to be cancer, which runs in my family, you guys are in trouble because this was documented by my wife..</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>jesse peacock< /Name>< rate>

One of the best Kaiser. Staff are friendly here and treat you like a human being. Their volunteer staff are always willing to point you in the right direction, and help you push the wheelchair.

Their pharmacy can be a zoo and the wait can be challenging. The line to drop off your prescription is pretty quick, but on a normal day, you can expect anywhere between 15 to 30 minute wait and then have to wait in line for another 15 minutes to pick up the prescription and if you have a consultation that can add another 10 minutes.

The parking lot can get pretty full by mid day but you can always find an open space.

They also have a pretty nice cafeteria with decent food. You would think a place like this would have mediocre food because you have no choice, but it's actually not bad. They have a variety of healthy choices at reasonable priced. I paid $5.99 for a chicken taco salad. Cafeteria dining area is pretty big so there's ample seating. They even have a public microwave to warm up your own lunch too</Review>

He was put on CPAP. Dehydrated  my eye. Some one better start listening  to the post here and find out who needs to be fired. It's not the first time they have made mistakes with my father.

The doctors here really don’t care about your health, all they do is prescribe Medication tell you you’ll  be ok and that’s that. They had me do an unnecessary X-ray for a sprained ankle. I’ve gone and met different doctors for different things and they’re all the same. I’m honestly disappointed since Kaiser is suppose to have the best Doctors. I honestly try to avoid going to the dr as much as I can for this same reason I haven’t picked a Regular Dr to go to.</Review>

Entered emergency Saturday morning no complaints. Fairly quick diagnosis that I needed my gaul bladder removed which occurred late Saturday by laparoscopic procedure. Hemoglobin count is 16. Normally I would go home the next day but they kept me to watch me bleed out internally. About 3 days later they are offering me a transfusion. I declined, requested iron, and a diagnosis of the problem which they finally agreed to the next day 4 and sending me home with a belly full of blood and a count of 7.8 on day 5. CT test showed a large hematoma in abdomen and no active bleeding. I was told that my body has to get rid of the blood. Abdomen is distended and firm. In reading about these issues they could have gone back in to stop the bleeding and drain the excess blood. The surgeon's lack of action is indicative of an attempt to cover up a mistake at the risk of my life. I tried Blue Cross before and found it difficult to navigate. Kaiser is great until you really need them. I can find no process for help if you have no confidence in your doctor.< /Text>

<review>I like how the pharmacy is open 24 hours a day, also the capacity, I never have to wait in for any procedure, labs, medicine or otherwise. I've been to the emergency room too... that's a whole nother story. But as far as medical centers are concerned this one's pretty good< /review>< Pictures>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Where do I even start! My mother has been at the Deer Valley Kaiser for 3 weeks she is unable to get up on her own since she is recovering from a major surgery. The nurses here are ridiculous! EVERY single time I walk into my mothers room, she is wet! My father, sisters and I spend every free minute we can there but its still not enough. I have spoke to floor managers that promise for things to get better and they don't!!!!!

Perfect examples of the care here:

#1 I walked into my mothers room at 6:45 PM. Her legs were hanging off her bed "thank God she didn't fall". Her bed was soaked and her blankets were wet and she was freezing. There was even a huge puddle of pee under her bed. The nurses helper was so upset by what she seen she wanted it reported to the floor manager.

#2 My mother called for help to go pee and a nurse stuck her head in my mothers room and said I'm busy and told her to go pee in her bed.

This has been the most horrible care I have ever witnessed.

Very sad to see what health care is coming to.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Im not sure how this place has a 4.1, everyone Ive ever talked to says kaiser sucks, my husband got these bumps all over his body and its been 2 months and they are just now doing a EKG to check his heart.

As of now, they have prescribed him some 'universal' antibiotics. Supposedly his blood work came back fine, but all the test they have done on him, have been at our request.

We've been the ones doing our own research, trying to figure out what's wrong with him because no one cares here.

And, we had a scheduled appointment, and 45 min later they are finally seeing us, but now we have to wait to get the EKG because they went on lunch. Ridiculous!!!!

If you like self  diagnosing; this is the place for you. Cheap because you get what you pay for.<//text>

Members have lots of doctors to choose from.   Referrals to specialists move quickly.  If you are not happy with a physician, you can choose a different one on your next visit.  The cost is very affordable.</Text>

I have all good things to say about staff/nurses/doctors etc. I moved from Fremont and it is like 300% more better and friendly environment. The best part is accessibility of things in simple request. Kaiser should train their all hospital staff in sameway.<//Review>

<review>i love our Brentwood Kaiser Hospital and Medical Office Building.  It's modern, convenient, and has great staff.  My only concern is how long it takes to get a prescription, so I do most of mine by mail.<//review>< Pics>

My wife and I are expecting and are from Washington state - lets clear that up beforehand. Kaiser is something new to us. This will be the first and last time they are used.

We are used to a certain level of professionalism and quality of care.
Each time we have been, I am separated from my wife while she is questioned over spousal abuse. This is an outright insult to both of us, but we are told it is 'policy'.

The facility is poorly managed

I have had the experience of an attendant YELLING at a woman who simply wanted a note for her daughters injuries.
If we were not so close to the delivery date - we would go elsewhere.

Try to avoid this place if possible.< /review>

Dr. Baskin, in the Emergency room on New Year's Eve refused to give me a CAT SCAN and sent me home. I did need a CAT scan and was admitted with a severe issue that a CAT SCAN done the following day through another doctor showed. I could have died as a result of this physician REFUSING to TREAT ME PROPERLY. He was arrogant and just in a hurry to send me packing!  This was at the Kaiser Antioch ER.<//text>

<review>Kaiser is greedy and money-hungry. Instead of finding ways to help you save money on already expensive medical costs that cost a fortune with or without medical insurance, they will try to find ways on how you can spend more money. Even their food in the cafeteria cost too much.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1509512781283<//Time><gmap_id>0x808ff867ba2ed567:0xc7198e2e14850edf<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

Some of the doctors here are INCOMPETENT and prescribing the WRONG MEDICATIONS that you don't need. The doctors couldn't figure out what is wrong with me and they run tests and labs, some of which are unnecessary... SO my medical costs went up to 15k just for the tests and labs and they have not treated me yet. I'm actually afraid to know how much TREATMENT would cost.< /Review>

<review>6/22/17 my fiance was admitted by ambulance to ER at app 2:45 pm and was having a stroke, was given medicine because he was on warfin which was in his chart. First of all with him being a high risk case someone decided not to send him to John Muir Trauma center, and instructed paramedics to bring him to Kaiser Deer Valley, I couldnt understand that decision. They did take a ct scan and saw a little bleed, and gave him meds to counter act the warfin, hour later he had full crainal hemorrhage with seizure, no one in the  room because I step out to go the bathroom, when I got back they would not let me in the  room, all of this happened within 10 minutes and Doctor came in and told me he took and turn for the worst and did another ct can and head was full of blood and at that time he was in a coma and never regained consciousness, and passed away at 10:55pm that night, anytime someone dies it is very hard, but I still wonder if the decision was made to take him to John Muir Trauma center would his out come have been different.. I have been Kaiser patient for years and love my Doctor but this question will always be in my heart.<//review>< rating>

Horrible customers service
We just moved to Brentwood  and I had to came here 2 times for my little baby's appoitment.
First time, my baby was very sick and I was sick too so I asked my mom went with me, she could help me holding the baby. The very rude man that I think he is a Mexican, talked on the phone( I needed some one totranslate to  Vietnamese ) that the baby was with his mom, his brother and his grandma. He talked with a very loud angry voice and kind of mad because we had so many people went into the room.
Second time, today, I went to the same place and because I was late 18 minutes ( hard to find the parking) but I was waiting patiently. No one helped me after 1 hour waiting. Maybe because I am Asian, they don't care much!
Good job Kaiser. We get the service by PAYING for it. I don't get it for FREE. DON'T BE RUDE!!!
now I have to wait until nexr year to change my family health insurance to another better comany

<date>1496180098982< /date><Text>Ouch!  Foot Dr. visit at the Deer Valley facility.  This hospital is always clean and actually refreshing to walk into.  The ladies immediately direct you to the correct floor and give you step by step instructions on how to find your Doctor.

Let's get back to the OUCH!  I've had a neuroma on the bottom of my right foot for a couple years now.  The pain is excruciating and it hurts to even walk barefooted.  I was at the point where I would do anything to relieve the pain!

Dr. Coggie referred me to Dr Razzante.  He's a very nice Dr. and cute (I had to throw that in there)!  He decided to give me a Cortizone shot in my foot.  OUCH!  The man (the shot) brought tears to my eyes!  Good God!  That sucker hurt but I do feel better.  My foot feels weird but I'm not hurting anymore!

If you have foot problems request him.  He only works one day a week so get on his schedule early!

I'm pretty much a Kaiser junky and wouldn't go anywhere else!  Don't get me wrong I've had a bad Dr. once but only once!<//Text></record>

Worst help I have ever received. The doctor did nothing to even see what was wrong. I would never ever recommend this hospital if you actually need help.<//review>

Unsatisfactory! :( The nurse was suppose to stay with me and he goes off and wonders somewhere else. He wouldn't tell me what I was taking, he gave me some medicine that I had no clue what I was taking. Later on that night I got sick on the city bus and threw up.</Text>

Delicious authentic Salvadorian food, their curtido was very flavorful as well as their salsa. Their fried calamari was delicious along with their Siete Mares (7 Seas Soup) I have had better pupusas in Berkeley and Hayward, but they were still very delicious! Will definitely be going back!</Review>

<Text>Have you ever gone someplace and felt like you're in someone's home? That the meal you're eating is home cooked and made with just a bit of extra love? That's the vibe from this place. It's amazing, and with so much of their family history in it. I'd definitely bring a group of friends here.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJAeo1lBnK5uGg_5qUa1mp9lr8RjJ7U6xZrzyS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

This restaurant was an amazing find and is a must visit for lovers of Salvadorian food. Having lived in El Salvador for two years I can promise that the pupusas served there are legit and also boast loroco as an option, a condiment not every restaurant has. The atmosphere here is also very friendly with authentic loud music and kind waiters. If I had the opportunity I would be a regular here, but the least I can do is write this glowing review for anyone deciding if they should eat here. 5 stars!<//Review>

Was provided a menu and a few minutes to look it over, no pressure, ordered the bistec encebollado, and a couple of bean & cheese pupusas, as well as the orchata. Everything was served hot, perfectly cooked. The steak was so tender I was able to cut it with a fork. The salsa was some of the best I’ve ever tasted. The pupusas were full of beans, cheese, yet not greasy. Not sure why this place only scores a 4.2 but it’s 5 star in my travels and lord knows I’ve been just about everywhere in my lifetime.</Review><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

I also order the Yucs frita,yuca was good chicharon was tasty but not enough on the plate. Their seafood quesadilla was very tasteful! 😁 i would not put the sourr cream on it, no need for it!

<Text>So I had one of my clients recommend this restaurant, and after going to a few I had given up hope because I love pork/chorizo popusas and haven’t found any that I had liked and now I have! Omg they’re amazing! I will definitely be door dashing these again!< /Text>< gmap_id>

<review>I had a bad experience. I order one bean and one cheese pupusa and was given a cheese with loroco pupusa. When I told the waitress she tried to become  argumentative with me by saying  that's what I ordered a cheese one; to which I replied yes but not cheese and loroco.  She then states that's the way there cheese pupusa come not with just plan cheese. The menu however states bean w/cheese, loroco w/ cheese, or just cheese.  Bad experience for my first time here.  Plus, waitress along with other employee's then had a rather crass attitude with me and my friend.  Like the saying goes: " If looks can kill I would be dead."<//review>< Pictures>

<text>El Miguelano is one of those places you wouldn't go into unless taken there first. Yet this hidden gem is one you'll go back to time and again!
They have wonderful food and the staff is always nice. It's family owned and has a great inviting feeling like you're at home in your own dining room! The music is always on and could be loud to some but I find it nice as the tables are close together and it helps keep your conversations within your group.
Prices are just right and the portions are generous! Not a first date place, but one of those special places you bring those you're comfortable with.  Try it out. I think you'll be back!</text>< pics>

Really good food for a good price. They play Cumbia as you eat and the food is very authentic. The service is good and the servers have good conversation.  If you want to pay with credit card your purchase must be at least $10< /text>

We found El Migueleno as we were passing through and were happy to have found it!  We ordered 2 bean and cheese papusas and the enchiladas verdes.  It was all delicious!  The service was also very good.<//text>

Having lived in El Salvador for two years, I can testify to the authenticity of this place. I could tell as we walked in and heard the music playing louder than the typical American joint that this place is authentic. We ordered horchata and pupusas and they did not dissapoint. The Salvadorian horchata is the most authentic I've had since being back in the states and the pupusas are amazing without being too costly. Another way I could tell this restaurant is authentic is that the server began talking to us in Spanish (even though we don't necessarily look like we speak it). Don't let this discourage you though if you haven't brushed up on your español since our waiter switched to English when we didn't understand everything.< /Text>

Worst tacos I've ever had (at a restaurant). Came in for carne asada tacos and there were so many problems. First, the meat was really bad, he took it and threw it in the microwave and then just dropped it on a tortilla. It was dry, the consistency was like old roast beef and WAY to spicy (along with a lot of fatty pieces). Second, was the tacos themselves, no cilantro, SO much spice and little flavor and the tortilla tasted old along with the vegetables. Finally, the service was weird, everyone kept staring at me and I felt very unwelcome and all the chef and other employee(?) were obsessed with a football game on (soccer) which is probably why my tacos were bad. Price was so-so, $5 for two, but I can get cheaper and FAR better tacos other places (California Tacos Grill / La Tortuga / Turtle Bay)<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The food is very good and the attention is excellent. The place is small and you feel a family atmosphere. The only thing that I do not like is that it does not have much space to park.

< Review>
Some teens nowadays have no customer service or social skills. Not the case at this Subway !! I ran down to.Subway half an hour before closing cause our power had been out since 2pm that day.  Greeted with a smile the crew got  right to work on my selections,. Cold cuts and veggies were fresh  and fully stocked. And the sandwiches were fantastic. Kinda rare for being the last customer of the day in my experience.  My Turkey, Bacon and Guacamole and Meatball were still nice and warm when I got em home to eat them. Great staff, Great service, Great Job !!!< /Review>

The custom (me) is right and they went above and beyond for me more than once. Their produce & meat are both very fresh! If you're going to go to a subway, make it 10033 Combie Rd.

6/6/17- 3:45pm We went after I picked my daughter up from school. A teenage girl with horrible attitude- eye rolling, rude tone of voice and body language attempted to help us- if I was her boss she'd be fired immediately. She seriously lacked people skills. The young man who finished our sandwiches & checked us out was very sweet and professional. I'm contemplating calling he owner re the attitude girl</text>

<review>I used to work at this place, and the food there unknowing to the customers was made in an unsafe environment. There was even a huge problem where the manager refused to get rid of rotting tomatoes because "There was still useable ones in the box". The lettuce also is not fresh, it is precut and shipped in bags to the store, along with all the presliced meats and cheeses and precooked bacon. Our nickname for the 'meat' used there was "ham flavored water". I advise against eating here because of low sanitation concerns, food safety being ignored, and low quality product made expensive.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Golden Spoon is my absolute favorite frozen yogurt shop in the Inland empire for sure. The staff is very friendly and I always get just what I need. I have been coming here since I was in elementary school in the 90's I believe. Well either way it had been many many moons. Lol. Come check it out y'all.</Review>

Love this place. Been going there for years. Kind of pricey for a family of 4 if you get toppings along with the yogurt but the flavors are all great and it's creamy, not ice milk like a lot of frozen yogurt. Tons of topping choices and there's rarely a wait or line.</text>

< review>
My wife, our son and myself just came today 4/6/18 to get some frozen yogurt. The staff are friendly and the yogurt is great! Im very happy  that they care about nutrition and they label it on the options.  We use to go to the one in redlands but unfortunately that location closed. Keep it up!< /review>

Love the frozen yogurt.  Really good flavors to choose from.  Peanut butter is #1 for my family.</review>

<Review>Great place for yogurt. The only negative is there's usually one flavor that isn't "working."  Still my daughter's favorite place to visit when she's home from school.</Review><Date>1498190811551<//Date>< Pics>

It may not be self serve, but the frozen yogurt is much better quality and flavor than the self serve chains around<//review>

If you are in the mood for food with bright crisp fresh clean flavor East West is the place. The spinach quesadilla is a great example of the delicious fusion of their cuisine and great fresh flavor. The Mediterranean platter is great  and the portion is big enough to split with someone. I've never had a soup here that wasn't tasty. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. Great that they have outdoor seating right now. I give East West an A+.</review>

< Review>
Overall our dinner was very good! The veggies were fresh and tasty, and the hummus and baba ganouj were awesome. The falafel patties blew me away! We liked the beet delite, but both found the grape leaves to be just ok. I loved the tabbouleh, but my wife wasn’t a fan.

The vegetarian tacos were pretty good - the black bean chili had a great flavor, but the steamed veggies, and the brown rice on the side, were pretty bland. The side salad was good. The overlapping tacos was strange - the pitas were overlapping each other and filled together, so to eat them you had to pull them apart and spread the filling from one to the empty space in the other.

The outdoor seating area was nice, but there was a fair amount of road noise until rush hour died down - nothing they can do about that, though.<//Review>

<Text>Love the tuna melt. Service is always good. Wait times for pickup aren't too long, and eating outside is also nice. They do have a gluten free menu and take lots of precautions to ensure cross-contamination does not happen from meal to meal.

The service was awesome, our waitress was super friendly and attentive despite having many other tables besides ours. The coffee is very good (especially their specialty coffees). We ordered soup and the Mediterranean platter, both were excellent! The hummus is truly to die for, so much so we brought back some just to eat at our hotel! If I lived here this would definitely be a regular place I go. Plus, bonus, parking lot in the back so no street parking needed! Would definitely come again the next time I’m in Santa Rosa.</Text>< pics>

If You Are A Vegetarian or Vegan; You Will Love East West Cafe! (If You Are Not - You Will Love East West Cafe’!) This is one of my top 10 for favorite places to eat! The choices are not like regular restaurants; they are healthier,  ingredients come from local sources and are of the best and freshest quality available! The menu selection has something for everyone and it can be a tough decision! The food taste is beyond delicious! It’s scrumptious! The staff is attentive, but not annoying, they are accurate with good memories, and they have just the right amount of laid back attitude to maintain a very welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable with a sense of belonging! I’d give East West Cafe 10 stars if I could! IF YOU HAVE NEVER EATEN THERE; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! EAST WEST CAFE. Healthy never tasted so good!< /text>

Awesome, healthy, vegetarian food. I was so sad when they stopped serving their teriyaki salmon! It used to come with grilled veggies, a salad, brown rice, and sooooooooo much of that good teriyaki sauce! PLEASE add this to your menu again, my family loves it and I want other people to get to enjoy it too!
The rest of the food here is equally good (once my family finished mourning their favorite dish, they instantly found a new group of favorites...aka the whole menu). The vegetarian/vegan options are totally great! I haven't eaten meat in so long that I don't remember what a burger tastes like, but even over all that time I just haven't been able to make a meal of some of the overly-healthy vegan food that some places serve. I mean, I just don't feel full unless I have a protein, you know? So I was super happy when my family found this place, because they had super good falafels (which are really filling), a lot of their non-mean dishes incorporate beans and other protein-packed legumes, and overall their vegetarian dishes are super comforting while still being healthy and ethical! The omnivores in my family always talk loudly about how good the meat dishes are, so this place is perfect for everyone!
Oh, not to mention they serve KILLER breakfasts!</Text>

< Review>
Amazing all around and super huge portions a bit on the pricey end, but compared to places like this in my city of Olympia, wa they offer a good variety of veganized options i wouldnt get and the portions are about 20% larger and just $2-3 more and the vibe is great. Certainly not no strip mall by a druggy filled bowling ally.<//Review>

Such a great, wholesome place. So many tasty house-made options. Some are gluten free, some could be vegan. They are all fresh and clean tasting. I love eating here after a hike in the park across the street. It’s kind of hippie like and all the ladies who work there are super cool and nice. They serve good beer and wine also.

I love the teriyaki chicken dish, the hummus plate, the tofu teriyaki and the salads. The dressings are also yummy.

There is parking in back and it’s right by the theater.
Good for families too!</review>

Great service, yummy food. TONS of vegetarian options to boot. Portions were substantial. Everyone in our group (veggies and meat eaters) left full and happy. Will definitely be back.< /Review>

<review>A local favorite for vegetarian and healthy cuisine. Mostly Mediterranean inspired, with some great original options. The pineapple chicken sandwich is always a safe bet. Not feeling meat? Try the braised tofu and vegetables- so flavorful, and cooked perfectly.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Good parking, good service. Lots of healthy food options, but the food itself isn't my favorite. Lovely pumpkin pie in autumn though. A bit pricey if you want it.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Always a pleasure! The veggie wrap was wonderful with the tomato side soup. I usually get one of their delightfully colorful house salads and signature basil dressing. Had to steal some of my Aunt's to get my fix this time. The lemon layer cake was phenomenal.

Service is friendly and prompt. Pricing is some of the best in the County when considering quality and quantity. I always think if this place first when making recommendations!</Review>

A handful of vegan options, a decent amount of vegetarian options, and lots of omnivore options. Decent (7/10) vegan chocolate cake. Crispy fries. Tasty falafel and pita. Great service. All servers and hosts were friendly. Our server, Aria, was very attentive even during what seemed like a busy dinner rush. There are two fireplaces set at about table height and interesting decorations and muted light in the dining area.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I love this place. The food is delicious - great choices for vegetarian and vegan, but they also offer dishes with meat. My favorites are the falafel and sweet potato fries. The atmosphere is good and staff is very friendly.  Good sized portions. I like their lunch specials with soup or salad and a half order of the dish of the day. Great value.< /Review>< Pics>

Service was a bit slow. I had 40 minutes to grab dinner and spent 20 minutes of it for somebody to show up so I can order.
The food on the other hand was great - I had the Chicken Shish kabob and it was delicious; served wide a variety of grilled and fresh vegetables, brown rice, humus and Mediterranean bread.</review>

Sometimes, just because a place has been around a long time and you have enjoyed it many times, you forget to realize how amazing it is. On my last visit to this place, I was reminded. We had excellent service, wonderful food, a pleasant and inviting dining experience, and it's been happening there a long time! It's not a Mediterranean restaurant, or a Persian restaurant (as it is classified somewhere), it's more like a hippie, delicious, eat meat or not, restaurant that will satisfy everyone in the family.< /Text>

<text>I love this place!  Great tasting healthy food, generous quantities, reasonable prices, pleasant/pretty ambience, happy and friendly staff.  This restaurant is a treasure. The owners treat us like family when we dine there too!  East West is not pretentious, which is another attribute I appreciate, as I live in Napa Valley where nearly every business puts on airs.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x8084462a8e6b4d47:0xeef316456fd839f7< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Met an old friend here that I haven't seen in approx. ten years. My salad was good quality and our waitress was nice, not overbearing like some can be. She was kind enough to realize that we were catching up on old times and didn't come to our table too often (an art that some people in service don't pick up.) She was still attentive and we enjoyed our meal. We sat outside and besides the restaurant being on a busy road, it was surprisingly peaceful. Would like to return again to have breakfast (my favorite meal of the day) and really dig in :) Will return.</Text>

<name>J R< /name><Review>Amazing food. Vegan and vegetarian options available with not a lot of meat which I appreciate.
There is hummus in nearly everything you order but I don't mind that.
The food platters are very large so be prepared to take your food home.
Their wine is superb. Their dessert is awesome.
I wish I could go and taste everything on their menu.
Their waitstaff is so helpful and knows the menu like the back of their hands. They know how to properly recommend options to go along with your meal that complement what you're ordering.
The restroom is very clean and reminds me of a restroom that would be in someone's home.<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<Review>One of my favorite places for quality Mediterranean food. Everyone at our table was quite pleased. I'll return friends next time. The bill was well within reason for the quality.</Review>< rating>

I was in town on vacation and a friend took me to East West Cafe.  I had no idea what to expect, but man was it delicious.  Everything our party ordered was good, but mine was outstanding.  I had the tostada which was such a fresh take on the traditional dish.  I am a huge fan and when I move back will be coming here regularly.</review>

One of my very favorite places to eat. Good food well prepared. Veggies are consistenly cooked to perfection. Prices decent. Menu is consistent but plentiful in options for those desiring. I love to bring guests here. Great staff and atmosphere wirks for romantic dinners as well as casual meals.<//Text>

Would be awesome if they would not put a plastic straw in my cup without asking and if they would switch to cardboard take out boxes instead of single use plastic, since they are supposed to be "healthy." Food is good, but over priced, and super bland.< /Review>

<Text>Happy for some. Husband loved that there were so many vegan offerings. They're attentive to food allergies in general. They could make a little more money with smaller portions, with better quality preparation and presentation. This is the third visit in as many years and each time, the meat has been overcooked and the veggies cut so chunkily that they don't steam through enough.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>We have eaten here on many occasions and been pleased,  however my husband and I had a very disappointing breakfast there this past weekend.  The waitress seem annoyed by our interruption of her side work. The eggs were not seasoned and everything else but the salsa was bland and unappetizing.  I will be back for lunch but think I'll skip breakfast in the future.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I love the cozy cafe decor, relaxed socializing, that it's not a chain copy-paste restaurant and there is a health food vibe (brown rice, veggie plate, tahini,etc) where I can at least pretend that I am going to eat something healthy, but the food always leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Based on the atmosphere, I am always expecting something special and just get "okay".<//Review>< Pictures>

<username>Jonathan Donihue<//username><Review>East West Restaurant has unique and scrumptious food at a reasonable price. The ambiance is nice with both indoor and outdoor seating and the waitstaff is professional, conscientious, and friendly. It's located next to an alternative movie theater and across the street from one of the best parks in Sonoma County.

I really like this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone.</Review>< userid>

Food, meh. Service, not good.

Ordered the spinach quesadilla, which the menu says to allow an extra 10 minutes for.  Apparantly this message didnt get to the wait staff because our entree arrived about 3 minutes after the app.  (At least this explains the unwillingness of our waitress to change my wife's order 3 minutes after we put it in - we thought that with an extra 10 minutes it wouldnt be an issue... it was).

I ordered the chicken shwarma which was a gluey purple mess with about 5 pieces of chicken in it.  Not nearly enough of the thin, dry, burnt pita to eat it with.  Overall a poor presentation for a weak dish.

My wife had the veggie kebab (she tried to change out for a veggie burger which we didnt see on the front of the menu initially,  but this could not be accommodated. Even just a few minutes after ordering and well before our app).  It was ok.  It says there is pineapple in it, and the tiny piece we found between everything else makes it true (but hardly worth a mention in the menu).  1 kebab, a ton of flavorless,  mushy brown rice, and mediocre hummus and mushy  sides.  Overall, not great.

We had high hopes.  Disappointed.<//Text>

I enjoy going here on occasion. It's located across from Howarth Park which is adjacent to Spring Lake Park so it's nice to combine lunch and a walk in nature. I really wish they would update their menu a little and add some new options. Overall it's a nice environment and experience. .<//text>

I can't eat hummus, onions or soy, and am on a low carb diet, so it was a challenge. I finally ordered a "steamed vegetable plate" without rice and with chicken. The sauce was amazing, the vegetables cooked just right, and the chicken tender. It was just enough food to feel full without becoming overstuffed.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Consistently good food and service. We love coming here anytime of the week. They have a nice kids menu, a few good beers on tap, vegetarian and non vegetarian options, and the portions are good size.</Review>

The hummus they have is fantastic, you just have to try it. My favorite dish is the chicken schwarma, the pita bread and hummus is a good combo; but add chicken, tomato, and grilled onion really sets the mood, just thinking about it makes me crave it so badly! Why do I love so far away! Why!!!!< /Review>

<Review>East West Cafe is a great go to restaurant to enjoy delicious fresh food and the wait staff are very conscientious and friendly. Good for kids, fantastic grilled cheese sandwich! Right next door to a wonderful locally owned movie theater which makes lunch or dinner with a movie partucularly convenient. Try out East West Cafe!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Good place to eat for a mixed meat eater/vegan group. Servings are generous, food is meh. Noisy at lunch and dinner. Mid afternoon is quietist time. Sit in back in winter or expect to be blasted by cold air.</Text>

The food here always feels fresh and healthy. I really appreciate that there are lots of veggies in a lot of the food here. Big plates filled with healthy food, perfect for me.< /Text>

<text>Very fresh, healthy food, reasonably priced. I like their Middle Eastern sampler. They also have great breakfasts, but be warned, the only bacon is Willie Bird turkey bacon.< /text>< gmapID>

Food very good.  Falafel wrap, tuna melt delicious.  Big wrap, easy/large enough to share.  Hummus was excellent too.
Good service, would return again for sure.</text>

Great food and as always I enjoy different cultural cuisine. Service varies depending on the staff working on that day. Took longer to get our orders given the place was not busy. The food is delicious.<//Text>

Like others have said the food is great, but the service is horrible. the server didn't check back once, she didn't bring our drinks and a busser got the refills. We had to ask for extra napkins and get our own boxes.

This was after we waited 5 minutes for the server to get there.

I would give the food a 4/5 and the service a 1/5. I don't think I'd ever go back.<//Text>

It was ok.  They serve gluten free, and we were taking a friend it to dinner that can't have gluten so our choices wetter limited.  Never asked me how well done I wanted my burger done to,  and out came out murdered.  Dry.  Sad.

This would be a bad review of it was just my meal,  bit the more hippy type flood was pretty good.  Waters was nice.

Don't think I will ever order a burger here again :(<//text>

<Review>If you can get past the rude service, eat here. Honestly, I have tried to support their business because their food is actually great, but their servers and hostess have consistently been rude. They need some training, because I have discussed with several other co-workers who feel exactly like I do. The last time I went WAS my last time. It's definitely hurting their business and I feel sorry for the owner of this establishment.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x8084462a8e6b4d47:0xeef316456fd839f7</Gmap_id><userid>109824917620801004964<//userid><user_name>Heidi King<//user_name></record>

I have need to go again soon, but over the  years I have eaten here about a dozen times and it was always fine and friendly.  It has outdoor seating which  is great and it is right next to Hawarth Park and Summerfield Cinema which is also quite nice.< /text>

<Text>This place is hard to describe.  It's kind of a health food restaurant. You can get hummus and falafel.   It's open for dinner but I like it better for breakfast or lunch.  They do serve wine.  They also have a large tea menu.   There's outside seating that is fantastic 3/4 of the year and faces a large park.  This is a great place to go before or after spending time in Howarth Park/Spring Lake/Annadel. Also a great place to have dinner and a glass before you WALK to the movie theater next door.<//Text>< Pictures>

The food is good but choices are limited if you're gluten free. The only gf meats available are bacon and sliced turkey. It's no problem if you eat beans as the taco plate, falafel or hummus can be gf (but I can't eat beans). I had the BLT on gf bread and it was very good, but that's what I had last time... And the time before...</review>

<Review>Eastwest is a usually hit, sometimes miss local eclectic eatery.
Pro's: fun selection of vegetarian friendly food, usually well prepared, but also a mix of meat-centric food, family/kid friendly (crayons and coloring sheet always available).
Con's: Actually eating there can be a little dull, kind of cold-sterile, not relaxing, sometimes blah staff (although, sometimes great staff!).
My favorite is the steamed veggie plate with grilled tofu. Runner up is the falafel wrap.</Review>< pics>

Terrible service, they ignore you unless you get a waitress's attention. They served the hamburger overcooked with terrible fries, and the lavender lemonade was legitimately horrible.</review>

<review>Amazingly tasty (and healthy) food surpassed only by the professional and very pleasant staff. My favorite place to eat - I'm always happy to bring out of town guests to East West. My favs are the falafels, veggie burgers and vegetarian shish kabobs.< /review>< Name>
