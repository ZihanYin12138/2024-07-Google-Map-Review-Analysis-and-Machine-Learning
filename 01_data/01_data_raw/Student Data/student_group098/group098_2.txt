<review>There's ALWAYS a wait but it's so worth it. The food is so vibrant and full of delicious flavors all melded together so wonderfully. Rainbow salad is the bomb. Got several curries on different occasions and all delivered with a nice punch. Service is always nice.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

So so good. I love that this restaurant is vegan friendly, the atmosphere is nice, good service and delicious food. The sumosa soup, coconut rice, tea leaf salad and fire tofu are killer good. I don't have anything bad to say about this restaurant.<//review>

Mixed veggies with tofu. I live down the street and order takeout at least once a week. Their takeout food tastes better than dine in. Which is interesting? Covid doesn’t allow us to dine in anyways, so that works out. Take out food is warmer. And tastes more fresh. Very delicious. 10/10 recommended.</Text>

This is an excellent restaurant.  The service is quick and friendly and the food is so very delicious.  Find parking is the only problem ... and they don't generally seat you unless everyone in the party is there.  But, its worth it .. go often!< /review>

Started with the Burmese Samusas which had awesome flavor.  I sat at the communal table and the people next to me and I were sharing our food so I was able to try several things I didn't order.  Coconut rice was great.  Basil Chili pork belly was awesome especially with some extra chili pepper.</Review>< pics>

<text>This place is well known for their Burmese food and the long wait time to get a table. They don't take reservations, which is not too good. Our party of 6 waited for 90 minutes for a table, just to find out we sat in a big table with 2 other parties. The food was excellent, which was as expected. I'll come here again, when there's not that long a line.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dd3630880e86c9:0xa82914858feac7f0<//gmap_id></record>

I only make it out here a couple times a  year, but these 2 are my must have's: Tea Leaf Salad, Samosa Soup. The only downfall to this place is the wait time. I suggest u make reservations. But once you sit down and eat, all the exploding flavors from their dishes makes the wait worth while.<//Text>< pics>

Just ordered for takeout, I got the pad see ew . I was so disappointed absolutely dried out seem like it was the bottom of the barrel leftover noodles that were all broken up over cooked chicken on a bright note the broccoli was cooked perfectly but it was too dry to even eat without drenching it with soy sauce which I hate. As a chef I would’ve never allowed this to go out to a customer ever it was that bad< /Text>

<Review>I am definitely coming back to this restaurant. Their vegetarian soup is as good as they all say it is. I tried their chicken, too. It is something you will want to come back for.
It is a challenge to get in at night, though - it is a busy place, unsurprisingly!<//Review>< Pictures>

Fabulous curries at reasonable prices.  No reservations and limited seating so you may have to wait.  For the best meal, ask the wait staff to recommend a sampler menu including a soup, noodles and curries.</review>

<review>I have been to this restaurant twice now and I have to say I LOVE IT! There can be a bit of a wait sometimes so I highly recommend getting on the waitlist through yelp. We tried something different from what we got last time as there are many things on the menu that look amazing! Everything was great except for the garlic noodles we didn't find those so tasty and the garlic wasn't present! Nonetheless, we were very happy with our visit despite the garlic noodle</review>< pictures>

I got the sesame chicken (felt like keeping it classic) and was not disappointed, but wasn't blown away either (therefore 4/5). I had enough left over to make it into lunch the next day as well after they boxed it for me.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Great food, but the line is always super long for dinner and the restaurant is very small and crowded. Everybody should try Baramee Thai Restaurantat least once, you won't be disappointed.</review>

Impressed with every dish, with service to match. The name is not hubris. No reservations, so get there by 4:45pm or so if you don't want a long wait.<//Text>

This place is so good that i joined Google to get everyone else to go there.  Try the rainbow salad.  And call ahead to put your name on the (long) list - they'll call you on your cell when your table is almost ready!</Text>

I love this place. I tend to get the same thing. Roti, spring rolls and drunken noodles. It's a great lunch spot for me. It can get crazy loud inside on a busy day, and the waiter can be overwhelmed.</review>

<Text>This is a good place to share comfortable meals and intimate conversation. The food is well prepared, and staff attentive. The food is carefully prepared. It's a small space. Best make reservation. It's probably the best Burmese restaurant in the City.< /Text>< name>

I'll give overall 3.5 star. I like the service here usually polite nice servers. Our favorite is tea leaf salad. Hot tea here is good I like it. Some meals here always so so salty. If they put less salt less sugar I think it's gonna be much better.</review>

A couple years ago a waiter recommended the Baramee Thai Restaurant, pea shoots, and chili lamb as a nice meal for two. That's all you need to know. The chili lamb is stupid good. I don't even like lamb.</Review>

Like their food alot, and the service is attentive and friendly.  Their flavors are not overpowering and well put together. We ordered dishes a tomato based curry dish, garlic noodles, coconut curry noodles, the porkbelly basil, coconut rice, and tea leave salad. The best Burmese food in CA!<//Review>

<user>103891611723229736027</user><text>I got the thai basil gimlet to drink, the seafood hot and sweet basil as an entree, and the fried calamari as an appetizer. I seriously love basil, and all the dishes delivered! Everything was amazing. The calamari, served with a sweet dipping sauce and carrots fried in the same manner, was perfectly crunchy while being light on the batter and oil; it was seriously perfect, I can't say I've had better! The seafood basil entree was perfect too! It came with all varieties of seafood; white fish, shrimp, clam, and a mussel, served with basil and sliced peppers. The sauce absolutely delivered on the name, being spicy and sweet, salty with a hint of brown sugar. I poured my rice in to the bowl and ate it all up. I ate the salad last, lettuce and carrot in a sweet clear dressing. The drink was heavy on the basil, sweet and savory, I'm not one to describe alcohol well but it hit the spot! I'll be back before I leave town for sure!< /text>< Rating>

You may have to wait, but it's sooooo, worth it! Go early to get a table without waiting. it may be crowded and small, but an CA establishment not to be missed!< /review>

Probably one of the best Asian restaurants I know. This place is something else. Too bad there's usually such a long wait list and no reservations.<//text>

Expect a long wait to eat at this place. It's that good. Don't feel like waiting?  They have another location with a more limited menu.  Also, try their specialities. You won't be disappointed.</Review>

<Text>Incredible food. The chili lamb was absolutely amazing (ask them to increase the spice if you like spice) paired well with coconut rice. The coconut was also the best coconut I've ever had!

The restaurant is always very crowded, highly recommend you start waiting online via yelp waitlist at least 30 mins in advance.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I went to this place on a whim and I walked out a very, very satisfied and happy customer.

In terms of decorations, there is not a lot, but what it does use gives the place a very unique atmosphere. It's not overly bright, not is it too dark. If you so wish, they offer seating outside as well.

The food here was absolutely amazing! Let's start with the strawberry lemonade. Not only was it tasty, citrusy, and very refreshing, but it was also refillable for free! That alone is awesome, but then I was served my food and I almost forgot about the lemonade because I was met with an explosion of flavors from every item on plate. Explosion may conjure a sense of really strong and overpowering tatstes. That was not the case here. Everything blended together in harmony accentuating what makes each ingredient unique. The sticky rice went so well with the sauce that they provided.

If you want to go on a journey of flavors, this place is for you and you can rest assure knowing that the service is just as good.</review>

<Time>1506547397561</Time><rate>2</rate><text>I felt like the prices were a bit much for the portion given. I ordered combination flat noodles and combination fried rice and each dish had only TWO shrimp! In fact, the noodles had a shrimp and a half! The rice was ok, but aftet reheating the portion l took home, it was terrible! It was super sticky like it had cheese in it, so it basically turned into a disgusting risotto, asian style, just gross. The ambience is nice but the seating is weird as the chairs in the outside dining area are too short for the tables. I don't think I'll be going back as l ordered the only two dishes l would eat, so issa no for me, but l did at least enjoy the Thai iced tea.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyVePeqCe8enuWwRQZaTUzr4olY40UWvDT14in=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoy7f5kVfKtUL4DM1h3v4yuRQWyvmtgF0ajhHB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

I come to this marvelous  place once a month because I love the ambiance that is characterizes this place. The crew is very loyal and well trained. The service is extremely fast. Also, the food you eat is magnificent. I visited often and I was always delighted. The pay is modest. I suggest this restaurant to my friends and family.</review>

<Review>The ambiance was VERY good for the price. My only complaint is that my curry was a little too thin for my preference and the bell peppers didn't seemed to be cooked enough (heated through, but not broken down enough). If you want a cheap date spot this is it.< /Review><time>1469936758815<//time><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPO7b4958nlzlrHtUxDGsgQme4TocBFehNBAnDy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<review>This is a nice little place down the street from the Warner theater my friend and I visited.

The wait staff was incredible and if I had more money to give as a tip I would have given more.

I ordered the green curry, added bamboo shoots and asked for it to be spicy.

They brought out the curry in this beautifully exotic bowl that looked a bit like a tiny bathtub. It was green as advertised and when I tasted my first spoonful an explosion of flavor and spice graced my tongue. The eggplant was moist and acted like a delicate sponge. The bamboo shoots were fantastically crunchy and the bell peppers brought a fantastic yet brief relief from the spice.

She brought me a side of Jasmine rice (my favorite) and adding the curry to that made the experience even more delightful.

Keep doing what you're doing Baramee you have a good thing going.< /review>< UserId.>

This place is always super busy. I think they actually have another Baramee Thai Restaurant restaurant a few blocks away, which is what I think the hostess kept telling the other people but I really didn't understand if it was the same food or not.</text>

The food here is very good and the atmosphere is one of the best in small town San Pedro. Customer service is also really good. Ordered the beef and noodles, mixed veggies with shrimp and Thai boxing chicken. Didn't care for the latter but the other two were good and enough for me and my two teenage children. I sat outside on the patio and had them turn on the propane heater. Another patron had her dog on the patio so nice to know dog-friendly as well. I ordered a new drink on the menu, Thai basil martini and it was delish. Even with three dishes, one including shrimp and a drink, bill about $50. I was thrilled. I often order delivery from them but I like the atmosphere here.</text>

<review>Visited Baramee during Fleet week and came back this weekend and visited it again and was still fantastic food. We had Panang beef and I just love that with a side of white Jasmine rice. So good. We also had the orange chicken in their own house recipe orange sauce which was amazing and the orange chicken was so little battered yet crispy... unbelievable.<//review></record>

Best Thai food in San Pedro, possibly all of Los Angeles! Super fast quality service. Delicious authentic food. Great atmosphere! For dessert try the coconut ice cream it's the best, with real bits of coconut inside.</review>

Great service! I am greeted once I step foot inside and the length in time to take my drink and good orders were right on. I was here for lunch so there's not a lot of time to sit and wait, which did not happen here. Food is okay for Thai dishes. I is there was Tom Yum noodle soup.</text>

<rate>2< /rate><review>This place used to be really good, I used to order take out at least twice a month. The last few times the food was not that great and cold. So I stopped ordering from there. I had company in town and thought if we went to the restaurant it would be better. Wow was I wrong. There were 5 of us, when we arrive they had 1 other table. THe place is really cool vibe and the outdoor patio is nice to sit and take in San Pedro. The service was really bad. We had wait for ever just to order and to get drinks, which I thought was weird as there was no one there. We ordered and it took 25 minutes to get our entrees which two came out and the others were sitting waiting for their food, 6 minutes went by then they brought another two dishes out. My nephew was sitting there waiting for his food. I got up and went inside to ask staff were his dish was. There was no one in restaurant. The staff  said coming, coming, finally after 35 minutes my nephews entree came out. The food was better than my take out experience, but I will not be coming back or ordering take out from Baramee. I hope they fix their issues cause my neighbor also used to order frequently and they also stopped due to poor quality. It amazes me as they used to have really good food.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Great new place.  The decor is very nicely decorated and not over the top.  The tables are clean and it has a nice atmosphere.  I really liked the waitresses who were there every second and gave us water as needed.  The kitchen was also prompt and we got our food very quickly.  They also have a nice patio that you can hang out at while you eat.  I really liked the Tom Yum soup.</Text>

<review>I ordered my food almost two hours ago, and it still isn't here. We've called twice and they haven't been very helpful, they said it will arrive "soon" and that they are busy. Maybe the food will be incredible and make up for their mistake, but we may not even be able to because it's seemingly not coming. :( I'm usually pretty gracious with things like this, but my friend and I are pretty disappointed.

I recommend going, DON'T USE DELIVERY SERVICE.< /review>< Pictures>

Best Thai Food in San Pedro - perhaps in L.A.
Very Nice friendly wait staff. Very Attractive Downtown Pedro location - with street and within half block  off-street parking.<//Text>

The food here is great.  The decor is very....cosmopolitan....yuppie...whatever word you want to run with.  The prices seem a little high to me, but the food is good enough that I keep going back.<//review>

Tom Kha soup was full of woody pieces, they should boil the lemon grass in a pouch to allow flavor, without causing a choking hazard, very dangerous!

Custard/Sticky Rice dessert seemed very old, custard was grainy and runny, rice was a hard clump dried up on the edges, had to cut it with a knife, sauce was not sweet at all. Horrible, tossed it in the can</Text><userid>118409431952282224295< /userid>< name>

<Review>This may be weird that I noticed, but the potatoes in the yellow curry are the best I've ever tasted in my life. Normally in other Currys the potato is dry, but this one was buttery. GREAT IDEA! The red curry wasn't spicy though :( maybe they can make it spicy if you ask.

Drinks: The lychee Sapphire martini was good, it came with real lychee's (it's an odd texture but I recommend trying it if you never have)

And the ceiling fans are interesting!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dd3630880e86c9:0xa82914858feac7f0<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Really awesome customer service at this little place.  We were a party of 8 with a dog. We were seated on the cute patio, the food was really good! We ordered from happy hour menu and regular menu, spicy thai wings were delicious, coconut shrimp was so good and filet mignon skewer were tasty.  We had coconut icecream for dessert aaaaaaand that was really yummy! I will visit again.</Text>

I'm on a mission to find the best Pad Thai in Los Angeles Out of around 10 restaurants that was the worst No flavor at all The Toffu was no even fried. There may be a reason no customers dined at 6pm Sunday evening<//review>

Great Food, but definitely NOT $ rating. More like $$, with drinks bordering on $$$. Deserves 4 stars, but one star off for misleading  $ rating.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) First visited this place with the team at dinner. Delicious. Lunch menu has about 12 positions for every taste. Until I tried everything, I calmed down. Liked everything. I don’t even know what else to add. But the place is worth a visit. Do not be afraid to take spicy dishes, there is not much sharpness there but the taste is better revealed. The waiters are very cool guys because of what for tea from me received up to 50% of the order. Do not be afraid with out prices of 50 percent this is not much. The restaurant is very budget as for me

Впервые посетил это место с коллективом на обеде. Очень вкусно. Ланч меню имеет примерно 12 позиций на любой вкус. Пока не перепробовал все не успокоился. Понравилось всё. Даже не знаю что ещё добавить. Но место заслуживает посещения. Не бойтесь брать острые блюда, остроты там не много но вкус лучше раскрывается. Официанты очень клёвые ребята из за чего на чай от меня получали до 50% от заказа. Не бойтесь с из ценами 50 процентов это не много. Ресторан очень бюджетный как по мне</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Perfect place for lunch. Fast and friendly service. From the snacks: "Fire Fried Calamari" perfect, not stretched soft and tasty. Coconut Shrimp is a bit too greasy, but the degree of browning and perfect sauce make up for it. "Tom Yum sup" perfect, not too spicy, prawns and the rest of the ingredients complemented perfectly. Very decent prices. For about $ 15 you can eat very well.

Idealne miejsce na lunch. Szybka i miła obsługa. Z przekąsek: "Fire Fried Calamari" idealne, nie przeciągnięte mięciutkie i smaczne. "Coconut Shrimp" trochę za tłuste, ale stopień wysmażenia i idealny sos to rekompensują. "Tom Yum sup" idealna, nie za pikantna, krewetki i reszta składników uzupełniały się idealnie. Ceny bardzo przyzwoite. Za ok $15 można się bardzo dobrze najeść.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Good for work attire but man do these sweats fall apart way too easy.  And color bleeds out after 1 washing. I was expecting better quality at 20 bucks a pop. I'll just stick to Ross, thanks!< /Review>< Rate>

<user_name>Dee Tagoai<//user_name><Review>Andy who is the owner is very nice and my dad who is a senior citizen happens to be a regular at this L&L since they opened in Patterson. My dad is very particular on how he likes his short ribs and always orders a bbq plate. When he calls to order his food ... we appreciate that Andy who already knows him will have it ready. His staff are nice and food always delicious which is a definite + because when you have Great Service you'll have loyal customers.  I know my dad is happy and would recommend this place to anyone... aaaand who wouldn't want to eat Hawaiian food??? Thank you Andy for being so kind and may your business be blessed.<//Review><userid>101108464690582233005<//userid><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Great service!!! The cook came out to tell me about my food because I came late to pick it up. They kept it warm and bagged it up for me when I got there. The food was delicious hands down the best I've had in a while. I will definitely be coming back to this location in Patterson, Ca.</Review>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Honestly if these are the normal sized portions then we have a problem here in this town and the bar has been set and it's obviously too high so step your game up like L&L Hawaiian barbeque. So much food for 11 bucks I have enough for dinner later. Great job guys keep it up. I had the barbeque mixed plate and substituted the Mac for fries I'm stuffed and that is not normal for me lol. P.s. if your planning on sneaking out to eat and don't want anyone to know you better be ready to hide  your plate of leftovers<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYbolSsg2eTvvicRQPra1KL2ykyVPbTsQZRnrt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I’ve been going to this place since it opened, I never tried it before but It’s fire! The chef never takes a day off he’s a hard worker. That says a lot about a person. Good people, good food. The ladies in front r the best they make u feel welcome and always take care of you. I’m an L&L faithful...< /Text><Name>eric garcia<//Name><user>114630948546695162204< /user>< Rate>

Soooo bomb!!!
I highly recommend getting the regular size plate it's honestly just with it, and if your like me who doesn't eat a lot in one sitting but likes to make take out stretch the regular plate is awesome! Plenty of food for two or three meals. Amazing flavor, I would also recommend getting extra sauce if you like to put it on your rice.< /Review>

We ordered for the 1st time today and it was not what I expected.. Macaroni was warm and hardly no cabbage.. Meat wasn’t on point.</review>

{'time': 1592356958916, 'text': 'hello, Juan! I’m sorry to heard that, and we are very appreciate for your comments. Macaroni should be warm because we put it in with the meats, you can request the macaroni on the side next time. So that will be cold. Also with the cabbage if u like u also can ask for more too, it is free. The meat that is the one I really concern about, can you please tell me what did you order and how bad that was? You can reach me at 415-568-0062 and my name is Andy.\nOnce again thank you for you taking your time to give us comments!'}< /response>

Very well stocked dive shop. Competitively priced. Knowledgeable staff. Very conveniently located for diving around LA harbor, San Pedro and the Palos Verdes peninsula. Much better product selection than most of the other dive shops in the LA area, with a decent inventory of products for technical divers< /text>

<review>I'm not surprised Pacific Dive Center is the top rated dive shop in LA. Dani taught my advanced course and was the most incredible teacher. She made us feel safe and comfortable in the water the entire time. She is such a kind hearted and fun loving person who genuinely cares about people becoming better divers. I definitely feel like my skills increased after her class and am much more confident in the water.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Just finished open water certification yesterday with a group of friends and an amazing instructor, Beth. Enjoyed the experience so much a few of us are moving on to the Advance classes. I had a great time and would recommend this to anyone. The instructors are patient and give you what you need to enter the water confident so you can enjoy your dive. Great experience, can't wait for the next.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Just moved to the area and needed a new dive shop to call home. Met Cullen who was amazing! Knew his products, well versed on local activities, gave me some great deals which will ensure this is my new go to shop. Can't wait to attend their next club meeting.< /review><date>1609480329425</date><Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Teresa Bryant</Name>< user_id>

As part of the certification process, I had my first open water dives in Catalina, and felt super confident diving in the ocean for the first time. We got to see so many fish while practicing scuba skills. Would highly recommend anybody thinking about scuba certification go to Pacific  Dive center and ask for Cullen as their instructor.<//Review>

<Text>I just received my Open Water certification at the beginning of this month and i am hooked. My instructor, Laura Angelo, is an incredibly talented diver and teacher, highly encouraging and patient with corrections. She has a way of instilling confidence in people and pushing them to the next level.< /Text>< Name>

<text>Pacific Wilderness  also has numerous weekly dive trips to some of the best SoCal locations and they also offer annual trips to various dive spots around the world. They also have an outstanding dive club with monthly informative presentations. The club also gets together for beach cleanups and other social events, and let's not forget the divers at Eco who are also a great bunch of people as well.<//text><response>None<//response>< date>

Just a quick side note before I conclude this review.  My girlfriend was with me during this course and she's someone anxious about being underwater.  On the second dive of our last open water day she basically freaked out and through Jarret's quick thinking he managed to calm her down, provide a solution (holding my hand), and continued on with the dive.  Bravo.<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1618087176137, 'text': 'Hi Nicola\nLet me address your claims.  I’ll agree with you that your Instructors were great, but I will defend our shop on your claim that we are “Disorganized” and that we “lost your paperwork for more than a week”.\nI’ll point out that you were unable to complete the February 27th OpenWater course because – according to your Instructor – the “Water was too cold” for you.  No big deal, it happens sometimes.  When this case arises, we normally recommend students get a “referral” and finish their dives at a warmer dive destination.  In your case Nicola, you opted to complete your OpenWater Dives in warmer waters and the instructor said he would make arrangements for “referral” paperwork that you could take to a shop in a warmer location to complete your course.\nFast forward to a few weeks following your conversation with our Instructor.  You sent in a friend to “pick up your referral paperwork”.  Your friend arrived not knowing your Instructors name or class start date – only your name.  Since we have more than 500 OpenWater students come through our store each year, a student name is simply not enough info for us to find paperwork.  So, we asked your friend to call you for more information.  When he got you on the phone, we asked him to find out your Instructors name and class start date so we could find the paperwork in the appropriate Instructor mailbox (we have 21 potential mailboxes to look through).\nWhile your friend was on the phone with you, you called the dive shop and I answered the phone.  Now I was already dealing with your friend who was in front of me - on the phone speaking with you AND now I was dealing with you directly on the shop phone.  When we spoke, I simply asked you for the following information: Your Instructor’s Name, Class start date & your full name & phone #.  I asked you to give me about 30 minutes to locate the information and I would call you back.  I found the info in about 5 minutes and was in the process of making copies of your files for the referral letter, when you called back.  To be blunt, you were impatient and pushy throughout the 10 minutes I personally dealt with you.  Even though the entire process took LESS than 10 minutes.\nYour claim that we are “disorganized” is false.  We just needed basic information to locate your records. Further claiming we “lost your paperwork and it took us more than a week to find it” is complete fabrication.  Our communication with you was spot on and took less than 10 minutes in total start to finish.'}</Response><gmapID>0x80dd37d2acf9cbeb:0xbf4b387bad31b22a< /gmapID>< rate>

<user_id>109376246796648889607<//user_id><Text>The instructors were great, they took all the necessary time to help us understand the process, they walked us through all the techniques and they made us feel extremely safe at all time. It was very awesome. (I really felt much more prepared  when I went diving with other people later on)

I would have given 5 starts if it wasn’t for the fact that the people running the shop didn’t respect ANY Covid protocol. No masks, talking very close to your face et cetera.

On top of that, they were rude and disorganized with my paperwork. I needed to pick some papers up so I called to check if they had them and they said "i am sure they are here". I asked to double check because it was a long drive for me (1.5h). They repeated annoyed "I am sure they are here". I went there and they couldn't find it. I had to leave and they asked me to ask the instructors to contact them. Which I did and then I had to come back one week later. And the whole thing was almost handled like I was annoying them.

Tl;dr - Great instructors but people running the shop were a little rude and disorganized. No Covid rules respected in the shop either.< /Text></record>

I had a lot of anxiety about diving and after a couple sessions I thought myself incapable.  I spoke with Beth, the owner, who recommended private sessions with Autumn. Autumn is intensely knowledgeable and experienced. This was comforting. Scubabros make me skittish. Autumn made sure I was prepared and was an excellent communicator. It was like scubadiving with a mermaid. I had so much fun and am planning my first scuba trip. I was so close to quitting and Autumn's exceptional professionalism got  me through my training. Thanks, Pacific Wilderness Inc center!!!< /text>

Very rude person who answered the phone when I had a question about some tanks, who made a snarky remark about getting information off the internet from people who drink too much (what?) without asking more about the situation and where I obtained information (DEMA, btw).   I've never really used them and sure would never go.  Pretty sure I got that response because I am female too.  ETA:  Jeff, I appreciate your response but would have appreciated it more if you contacted me personally.  I am a PADI MDST instructor, trained cave and technical diver, with over 20 years experience in diving.   Jason never asked me my experience, nor gave me a chance to give a full explanation...he blurted that out as soon as I started talking.  So while I appreciate the apology, the excuse along with it dilutes the effort.  And even IF I had no knowledge/experience or read something in a forum...(which is not what I said).....I should still be treated with respect.< /Review>
<Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1602116655005, 'text': 'Hi Mary\nI apologize for Jason coming across as “Snarky” in any way.  I would like to ask for your understanding as we get calls all the time from people “Who read things online”, usually from Chat Boards and usually written by people who know less about diving than the person reading the information.  In your case, you did NOT mention anything about where you read the info and Jason Jokingly told you that oftentimes comments online are the result of somebody writing after “consuming too much wine’.  All I ask is you put yourself in his position, listening to concerns from somebody who repeatedly said they “read something online” and at no time lead with where they read the information.  Jason has used this wine comment a hundred times before when people start a conversation about “Reading things online”.  Obviously, he made the wrong assumption in your case and the conversation went in the wrong direction.  I’ll point out Jason did apologize about the wine comment after you told him you read the article on the DEMA web site.  Though, by that time, you were understandably frustrated with his general answers and advising you to take the tanks to your local dive shop for review.\n\nIn my shoes, had you lead with “I own two Pressed Steel tanks and I just read a DEMA article that stated…” I think the conversation would have gone down a different path.  Not an excuse, just asking you to understand communication on Both Sides is important for the best outcome.\n\nNow, with me assuming you read a 2015 article about Pressed Steel’s “Special Permit” not being renewed (E-9791 – probably the # on your tank) by January 31st of that same year.  At the time of that article, If Pressed Steel’s permit were to expire / not be renewed, Tank Hydros could not be conducted on Pressed Steel tanks until the permit was renewed.  Honestly, in this case, ALL the concerns stemmed from Chat Boards back then with a big “What If” they don’t renew in time, what do “WE do” to get our tanks serviced.  In reality, the Special Permit was renewed on January 28th, 2015 and nothing happened.  So, based on my ASSUMPTION of what you read, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nIf I assumed incorrectly, just bring your tanks in.  We are a DOT Hydro Facility and likely better versed in Tank regulations than any other local shop since they are NOT a DOT Facility.\nI hope this helps & you accept my apologies.\nJeff\nOwner (Pacific Wilderness)'}< /response>< gmap_id>

Had a fantastic experience with the padi open water course. Khrystyna was our instructor with the assistance of Steve and Danya and they were all awesome! They worked really hard to make sure we had a smooth learning experience in the pool and the ocean and provided great feedback. Everyone in the shop was really friendly and knowledgeable as well. Will definitely be coming back for equipment and future classes.</review>

<Review>Josh, Dave, and Cheryl were my instructors for the PADI Open Water course. Sometimes things were easy, other times things were rough. It didn't matter though––all three were perfect. Josh's friendly nature paired with Dave's tough love and Cheryl's calm demeanor really made the learning experience captivating. Between learning the basics in the classroom, practicing in the pool, and doing the difficult but rewarding beach entrance, I feel fully prepared for any open water diving around the world. Take the 4 days to learn with Pacific Wilderness! You won't regret it... unless you can't swim👌< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Resp>{'time': 1568745945247, 'text': 'Hi Lady Mermaid -\n\n#1 - "10 year old Mares Fins" - I don\'t and have never sold Mares products...Also, I have a larger inventory than 99% of the Dive Shops in the United States, better prices than online (backed by a guarantee) and the Top Name brands - but NOT Mares.\n\n#2 "One Piece Bathing Suits" - We are a dive shop and have never sold ladies bathing suits.  So Jason offering you the closest option, Target, is the proper thing to do.  I call it good customer service.\n\n#3  "Watch out if you are POC, they discriminate" - Pacific Wilderness has sponsored LABUE Dive Club (Los Angeles Black Underwater Explorers) for over 30 years, so you might contact them about our "Discrimination" against "POC".  Additionally, my wife was Cape Verdean, a mix of African, Creole & Portugese, so don\'t hit me regarding race here.  We pride ourselves on having great customer service for ALL customers and that is clearly passed from me, to all my employees.\n\n#4 "No wheelchair Access" - Our Business has been here since 1953.  We have had the same entrance for more than 40 years.  It has not changed - though it does meet the minimums for ADA compliance and has the minimum required width, and no steps to enter.  Either way, we readily accommodate any person needing special assistance.  Additionally, we hold special Veteran\'s classes here for those that may have lost a limb in service.  Our Instructor, Melvin Pasley, brings Veterans to our shop to learn to dive or just for the experience / therapy.  We make every accommodation to make the experience a positive one.  So please don\'t say we have "No Wheelchair Access".\n\nWhat I don\'t have patience for is bad customers.  I make it clear to my employees that if a customer is being unreasonable, abusive or otherwise making other customers uncomfortable, just politely ask the customer to "consider shopping somewhere else, as it\'s apparent we are not making them happy".  Fortunately, this only happens once or twice a year.\n\nIn your case in particular, you came in with a dog on a leash (and I\'ll point out - you were NOT in a wheelchair and you did not appear to be a "POC").  We have a sign on the door clearly stating "No Pets Allowed unless they are Service Dogs Specifically trained to aid a person with a disability."  Your Dog had no Vest showing it was a service dog, so my employee asked you to leash the dog outside (In which case we have two nice shady trees outside and water bowls available).  You immediately went irate and raised your voice at Jason, made demands "under the ADA" and flashed an "ADA info card".  You were not only rude, but you became noticeably unreasonable.   Regardless, my employees - Jason & David - still tried to help.  We had several customers waiting to pay while you were at the Register raising your voice at Jason - looking for a confrontation.  The whole time he stayed composed, did not raise his voice and stated he was only trying to help you.  The customers in line backed us with our calm handling of your situation - so much so, that two different customers (one a Doctor), left us their cards with their personal phone #\'s to offer help in case you "Hired an Attorney on Contingency" as you threatened.  When you left, you had your dog use the shady tree on the North side of my building to relieve itself - and then didn\'t pick up the dropping.\n\nWhy you come back to give us a bad interview claiming we\'re selling "10 year old model Mares Fins" and "Watch out POC - they discriminate" is a reason I wish we - as a business - could do "Customer reviews".\nWe LOVE animals, but they don\'t have a place in our store unless they are Service Dogs.  I worry about pets biting customers, shedding on my clothing & wetsuits, jumping in our pool or relieving themselves in a corner.  We do have the utmost respect for those dogs that are specifically trained to help somebody with a disability (Physical or emotional), and we always welcome them - along with their owners anytime.'}< /Resp>< gmapID>

No need to apologize. I was being a bittuva dick because I am so tired of seeing Pedro turn crybaby . I only had a quick question and didn't want to take up your time or yell rudely from afar. There is a newer vibe in town as Pedro undergoes it's Newport Beachization , and apparently anyone who is riding a bike or not wearing Topsiders must be considered homeless or needs to use your restroom . If you would logically change the cos. name to Pacific Dive Shop, I would never have positioned my bike and dog/in basket, those few feet inside Pacific Wilderness, and scare you. Sorry.  Yes I realize that the undersea realm can be classified as wilderness. I however don't associate the two to degree that would dissuade me from making a quick , casual, neighborly old school Pedro inquiry , especially as a casual aside to a neighborhood bike ride.
Easy. 🌈🌊🐬👍✌<//Text>

I miss the gigantic polar bear that used to adorn the shop. Being a longtime SCUBA instructor, I decided to pop in and just check out the shop, only to discover that it was no longer a general sporting goods store - no bows or firearms related accessories, kayaking/biking or other sporting activity hardware or apparel - just SCUBA diving.

This may disappoint some who remember Pacific Wilderness as a sporting goods store, but one of their primary focuses was always diving and the support of underwater photography, spearfishing, and SCUBA diving. This has not changed. The role has only expanded and in fact, it's now a full blown diving shop only, and I found this refreshing, because all too often, mixing various sports together results in a shop that is incomplete in its offerings for each of the sporting disciplines.

Not only is Pacific a well stocked diving shop, with fill stations and attentive staff along with a complete line of many of the leading brands you expect; they also offer repair and regulator services, have their own onsite pool for classes with changing rooms and lockers.

Pacific Wildnerness is a PADI certification facility, which is fine, although it would be nice to see additional organizations like LA County and NAUI also represented as available programs as well.

I highly recommend.<//Review>

< review>
My barber Al left Berkeley to work closer to home in Napa. Now I come all the way from Oakland just for his haircuts.

I don't even care that much about my hair. But I've had haircuts in more states than I can count (and several countries), and Al is undoubtedly the best barber I've ever had.

A master of his craft who's also smart and kind, followed by a beer downtown -- what could be better?<//review>

By far the best haircut I’ve ever received—
Giancarlo is extremely professional and detail oriented! The shop itself is very clean and safe during the the COVID outbreak. Definitely going back!< /Text>

<Review>Steve and Crew are an exceptional team of Gentlemen. Professional enough that you feel like a VIP, but they are also down to earth enough that you feel like one of their close friends.

Haircut was top notch and Steve always goes above and beyond, completed quickly, and always with a smile.

Once you come here you won’t go anywhere else.  Big Shawn’s our choice, but all of these guys are all super meticulous with their detailed cuts. Walk ins are welcome, (usually 10 minute wait)however if you make an online appointment they are always on time.<//Text>

I was a walk in. Happened to get the new guy I'm guessing. Ricky was a little heavy handed and was pushing my head around with his clippers. Worked on my left side 80% of the time and it shows. Asked him to clean my beard up and he took a couple inches off it.  Wish I checked it before I left. I just figured I shouldn't have to check it if he was happy with his work. Nice guy but definitely not going back.< /Text>

This establishment had a genuine 50's appeal. Very clean. Very professional. Even willing to ask senior staff for opinion on results to ensure quality.   Best bald fade haircut I've honestly ever had. Seemed to be involved in the local community regarding charity. That's always great to see. I will continue to drive a great distance there for the quality receive.<//review>

You can't go wrong here. Just make sure to get an appointment, since only one barber does walk-ins.<//Review>

It's like going back in time to when your dad took you in to the old time barber shop.  Haircuts take about 35-45 minutes and are done excellently. You can smell the Pinaud  aftershave dabbed on after the back of your neck is shaved to your liking by a real barber.

It is a savored experience that cannot be rushed, very unlike a beauty salon like SuperCuts or other chain store "hair cutters".  When I went to those other places I was always impatient to get in and get out.  Here may take you as long or longer, but you don't mind the time.  When it is your turn you are treated like a king.

They have the right barber for whatever style you desire.  You have to try it!< /Text>

<Review>I came in to this place not knowing what I want it at all and was treated with respect and generosity. I was assisted super fast and asked my options, and Joseph spared the process up of me choosing what I wanted and made me feel really comfortable paperwork was great and so is his customer service I’ll definitely be recommending others to come and buy from here I’m so excited about my new bands Benz< /Review>< Response>

This place was fantastic! very helpful from the moment i walked on the lot. Very professional and polite. The small courtesy of offering water was a very nice touch. The process, which can be lengthy, went very smoothly. I would recommend to anyone.</review>

I was referred to Demetrie by friends who have bought from him in the past. He has a really nice location and office near midtown Sacramento. The service was great. There is coffee and water in his lobby with a beautiful fish tank. He was able to get me approved with very little turn around time. I'm glad my friends recommended him. Highly recommend for first-time buyers or challenged credit.</Text>

My husband and I have bought 3 vehicles from Capitol City used auto sales within the past few years.  An Escalade and Mercedes and Ford Explorer. I have been very happy with all 3 of my purchases.  Demetrie the owner Always takes care of us. I trust him and send all our friends to him. And We will be back when ready for a new car!< /Review>

<Review>I purchased my new car from Demetrie at Capital City Used Auto earlier this year and I absolutely love it! It was in great shape and it is an absolute blast to drive.
Being self-employed, it was difficult to convince the traditional lenders to give me the financing that I needed but Demetrie made it happen and made any stress I had at the time vanish. When I am ready to get another car in the future, I will definitely be returning here! Thanks Demetrie!< /Review>< pictures>

It over all depends on customers credit , the car, and customers income .  If you want to get a more accurate amount that would be needed for a down feel free to call me and I can run some numbers for you and find  the bank that works out the best for  you  !!

It was quite embarrassing & a bit scary for my customers who overheard this, so I went out and wrote down her “list” of problems and told them to leave the car and my mechanic would fix it immediately.

It’s unfortunate small businesses must deal with people who are not even part of the transaction. The most important part of this is, the vehicle is a CORVETTE not a Camero like Robin states.

<Review>This is the conclusion of my first bad review. After numerous text back an fourth from Demetrie Masouris he agreed to do repairs . I purchase car on 11/14/17 ,  8 days after purchasing the car. The car ran hot an water pump went out. Repairs as follow, replace water pump, but he did not replace thermostat hose an thermostat.  Rear view mirror, heads up display, trunk shock which hold the trunk up. Rear window defrost, breaks was bad. He advised car was ready for pickup. Got their an only few repairs was done. He advised his mechanics wasn't there on a Saturday to do the repairs. We took the car, WRONG decision. got warranty on car for $1500.00 called him because after getting car back from Demetrie within 24hours the engine light came on. The car engine began to make loud noises again. Had engine scan done  Cadillac converter was bad an radiator resivior was spraying out water.  Demetrie was really only concerned about me taking down my previous bad review during my entire conversation to him . He also continue to say I sold the car as is. I explained after paying over 17,000 for a car, I shouldn't be dealing with car problems in less than 30 days of purchase date. Contacted warrant company. I was advised warranty information not received yet an to contact dealer for repairs. Attempted to return car on 12/9/17 he refused to accept the car. Now I'm in the process of contacting attorney for "Failure to disclose what's wrong" if you don't want a headache. I recommend you do not purchase anything from from him.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1512943229872, 'text': 'In response to Robins review:  first off Robin was not here and has NEVER been here to my knowledge when her”son/nephew” purchased the car.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>My wife and I went to cap city autos for our last vehicle .  Despite my challenged credit Demetrie worked with me until past closing hours and was able to get me approved for  our dream car a 2007 lexus ls460L.  Couldn't be happier about my experience at the dealership  and the customer service I recieved there.  If u r looking for a car I highly recommend you checking them out as they have easy financing and a huge variety to choose from.<//Text>< Pics>

Its a nice expensive! Definetly for the family and frinds. Everyone its friendly and you will have a good time. Theres a lot of traditilnal food such as en hiladas, pozole, menudo, huaraches, tlacoyos, pambazos, carrnitas, puerco ahumado, barbacoa tacos, handmade and freshmade quesadillas(the real ones) tacos of many kinds, desserts! Atole, tostilocos, yogurt, icecream, churros, candy, gummies.....etc. this was the 3rd time i come and i notice a big increase in prices( pretty sad about it) in less than 1 moth prices on must stuff went up about $2.00. I would recomend this place. Remeber its every friday!< /Text>

<review>I hope this event can expand so that it offers more chances for other vendors to set up shop. I love walking around and appreciating different cultures coming together. This builds a stronger community and I hope we see more vendors in the future.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

La Puente live is a really cool event. It takes place every Friday and each event offers up different music.  And if course space for dancing.  It's a really nice event to take the family. It feels very small town.  I like that.
There's a nice variety of vendors.... from tupperware to make-up to clothing to home goods.  Every Friday brings something new.  And train ride for the little one. I love the fact you can just sit and indulge in people watching.  This is a bring your own chair event. Get the early... setup your chair walk the venue get your food and then sit and enjoy.
I definitely will be participating again.</text>

Great place to eat, enjoy the night out and lisent to live music in the streets of old town La Puente, here you can enjoy street food at its fullness, from a Taco de Barbacoa de Borrego to a Raspado de Tamarindo here you will need an extra stomach to try a little bit from every stand.< /Review>

Fun &  Great Entertainment. But Someone is going to get Fined one day with the Illegal food Vendors. No Health Permits On Many of them. And no Restrooms for them to use to use or wash there Hands. Wish they had Less Taco Vendors... Tells you alot about the Organizer & who's Really making the Money Here.</Text>

Amazing place to go with the family, enjoy the food, the friendly people and the vendors, if you like to have fun go La Puente Live ; I almost forgot the music is a nice experience . And for everything I mentioned before they deserve 5 STARS.

<text>Great place to get out at night. Plenty of food, good music, toys and a train ride for the kids. Only giving 4 stores because it's way crowded and they need to shrink the space where ppl sit for the banda so that the crowds can move thru easier<//text>< pics>

Don't need to drive 3 hours to go to Mexico. Just come to La Puente Friday nights for a little taste.

It's more like a night market where the majority of the vendors are for food -- just the way I like it! My favorites are Quesadilla Chile with homemade tortillas ($5), the barbacoa tacos across from that ($2), elote ($3), and the freshly made churros ($5). While the churros are a must, I wish they had smaller portions for less. It's just way too much for 2 people.

I could count on one hand the total number of non-Latinos at the event (us 2 included). With that said, most vendors can speak English as well, so don't worry about ordering. Of course, they were also nice when I was trying out my high school Spanish!

The event starts around 6pm. There's also live music starting around 7pm. Bring your own chairs to enjoy the music. Plenty of free street and lot parking within a short 1-3 minute walk.<//Review>

The best food! Enchiladas, tamales, goat by the pound, pan dulce, other foods. Local produce, a train for the kids, knick knacks and various vendors. Also they have a live band every Friday!<//text>

(Translated by Google) I am fascinated by the live bridge for walking and a tasty snack 🌮 as for the regular mmm music, it is repetitive because the happy music as a band and cumbiambera pulls much more people than even walking, but you still enjoy it and the vendors do much better and I think the administrators should invite Latin music musicians more times please pcapture that there is more attendance 😀

(Original)
Me fascina la puente live para caminar y un gustito antojitos 🌮 en cuanto ala música mmm regular es repetitivos pues la música alegre como banda y cumbiambera jala mucho más gente que ni se puede caminar relax pero igualmente lo disfrutas y alos vendedores les va mucho mucho mejor y creo los administradores deberían invitar mas veces a músicos de musica latina porfavor 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗capten que va más concurrencia 😀<//text>

(Translated by Google) I like it because there is a great variety of food with the original flavor of our countries, the tacos, Tequis baked pork tacos, mango crepes, in short you can choose from a lot of variety of food, and snacks.

<text>I am visiting family from out of town. I brought my granddaughter here for a little princess and Nanny time. I am so impressed with the level of service and attention to detail this salon gave my 7 year old granddaughter.  I paid for her to receive the Lavender Pedicure complete with stone massage. The young lady that took care of her did not skimp on her service just because my granddaughter was a child. She received the full spa treatment and was made to feel like a princess. I highly recommend this salon!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I made an appointment with Vicki and she was awesome. She was very patient while I shuffled through the many color choices. The foot massage was amazing! Hot stones 'n all. She listened to my mani/pedi preferences, and I am completely satisfied! She was very friendly as well. Highly recommended!</Review>

It was my first time at Blossom Nails and I cannot rave about Ann enough! I went to a salon in Napa 2 weeks prior and had the worst pedicure of my life-the woman cut me deeply and also left a piece of nail. I tried to wait it out hoping my toe would get better but noticed there was no chance; it was painful and swollen. I researched and found Blossom Nails hoping for the best. When I got there, Ann listened to my concerns and set a plan to try to fix the mess the prior woman made. Ann was able to fix everything! Painlessly too! I was shocked! I really cannot rave about Ann and her magic hands enough! I look forward to returning soon and I am so very happy I found someone skilled and caring! Thank you Ann!!<//Text>

Ive been getting my nails done consistently for the past ten years so I’ve very particular. Let me just say they earned every star I’m giving. Vicky is the girl who serviced me and she was amazing. She took her time and paid very close attention to detail. She also took her time massaging my legs, feet, and hands and did a great job. I didn’t feel rushed and I felt very relaxed. The atmosphere is very relaxed in the pedicure room with dimmed lights. It was a bit more pricey than what I’m used to. $100 for what I got but I’m ok with it because I had a great experience and my nails look 🔥. You can say I feel like a hundred bucks.

<text>I got a dip manicure and one of them broke after the first day. I noticed yesterday (only a week later) that MOLD had formed under one of my nails because they didn’t seal it correctly. Definitely concerning and I won’t be back.< /text>< Resp>

<review>I brought 2 teen grandaughters in here. They  quoted me $45 for full gel set. Then, AFTER the girls had their pretty, natural nails cut down and roughed up and the tips added, they told us to have the tips longer than in the photo, that they charge $10 extra, and to have them coffin shaped was another $5 extra (oh but they would knock off $5 because we hadn't been prepared for that!).
They said that's what all the shops here in Vacaville charge. But earlier today I took another granddaughter to the Gallery. They only charged $40 for a log, full set WITH a coffin shape.</review>< pics>

I honestly don't like getting my nails done. With the job I have, my nails chip and break easily. But coming here is a treat. The technicians I've had are really skilled (I do not get gel, sorry). Pedicures here are amazing. Their massage chairs are nice and the foot massages are genuinely amazing. I recommend Blossom to anyone looking to get nails and or toes done :)< /Review>

Love Blossom nails! Stopped in today from out to town to get my nails filled. I chose this business by the online reviews. I asked Emma for something different and upbeat, but gave her free rein. She gave me the coolest, funky color combination! Very pretty and fun! She obviously loves her job. The shop was a relaxing atmosphere near a Starbucks. I'll come here next time I'm in town.</Review>

<Review>If I could give 10 Stars I would. Linda, is amazing she is a perfectionist, she takes her time and does an amazing job. First impression means a lot, I had surgery on my forefinger (my crooked finger) many years ago and was embarrassed to have my nails done.
One day I got enough nerves to get my nails done, and believe it or not Linda performed a miracle ! my nails over shadow my skin graft.
Thank you Linda,  you’re awesome !!

They were very nice and did a great job! The only thing is that one nail smeared and didn't fix it. But otherwise I enjoy going to Blossom< /text>

Fantastic experience at this nail shop. Anne and Phoebe were gentle, patient, professional, and did a fantastic job for me and my five year old daughter. I can't wait to go back!< /review>

Mindy just gave me the prettiest pink and white ombré! Everyone there is so sweet, I’m so pleased with her work! She stayed twenty minutes past closing time to make sure my nails were exactly how I wanted... didn’t rush and didn’t make me feel bad at all. Thank you again Mindy!!<//text>

I don't typically write reviews but my pedicure experience was so bad I literally left and went to another salon for my manicure. I was offered a menu of pedicure options when I first arrived. I asked which ones come with a longer foot and leg massage since I was treating myself after a long work week. The pedicure I selected was $40. I was unimpressed with the massage, it was more like I was being pet... and the hot stone was uncomfortable because it wasn't being used properly. (I've had amazing and relaxing hot stone massages before). They attempted to skip removing any callus.. I had to remind and ask multiple times to have this done (isn't it included in a base pedicure... much less an upgraded one?) In the end, I had to have my toes repainted because the first was streaky and patchy. While they attempted to fix the mistakes... I ended up being there for 2 hours with a mediocre and stressful experience. When I asked them about the lack of detail cleaning up my cuticles/callus I was told.... it looks like that because my skin is dry. (Um.. that's why I'm getting a pedicure).

That's when I said I would like to leave and no longer get my manicure. When I was checking out they attempted to charge me $50 instead of the $40 option I chose. With insistence they did say that they would only charge $40.

I'm most disappointed because I was looking forward to this for 2 weeks and I rarely treat myself like this.

The one star that is given goes to the chair massage. Because that was the only pleasant part of the experience.</text>

The woman that did my nails acted like I was an inconvenience because I could not understand her very bad English and also did not want to hear how I wanted my nails rather than how she wanted them.   On top of her rudeness my supposed to be white nails turned yellow with in a day.  I am sure there are kinder employees here but unfortunately this one ruined it for my future business there.< /review></record>

There was only one other Chiropractor in the HD that use to be able to adjust me, he retired. Glad I found Stine……<//review>

My daughter had some soccer injuries and Stine Chiropractic was recommended to us. We saw Dr. Rob and he had her back to playing and pain free in a couple weeks. I definitely recommend this place!</review>

<Review>I came to dr stine chiropractic after 3 days of excruciating pain as a result of a car accident injury . I could hardly breathe walk sit stand sleep. I let the ladies know what I was feeling and they recommended Dr.D I believe was her name . She came in and let me know it was my ribs that were hurting me . It took 8 mins of my time and Dr.D had me walking out of there soar but so relieved where I could function . Thank you to the team for your recommendation and you Dr .D for your skills I can do basic movements again without being in excruciating pain! You guys are awesome .Best service so welcoming< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1620160504845, 'text': 'Pancho!

<Date>1519447839165<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Came here friday night expecting good customer service , but was met with the most disrespectful attitude from a lighterskin female wearing a beanie. I walked in to her and asked if my favorite barber was avaible for a cut ... She first off acted as if she did not here me while standing right in front of her, made no eye contact, and was very peevish. She tells me while walking away that they were done cutting for the day "period" ..no come back tomarrow nothing!! The nerve of anyone to treat a customer who is already OVERPAYING for a haircut this way!!! For $35 this customer service was awful. However the haircuts are nicely done ... I would recommend jeli for your next cut ..thats if you can stand the customer service.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Well, it was my first experience in this type of format. The format itself is a very good by business model. however, the talent needs to be vetted better.  Although the basic cut was fine, the line up was "jacked up". Perhaps the other barbers will perform better.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>I'm a woman with a busy career and schedule. I became frustrated with sitting in a salon for hours just for a trim and cleanup for my short cut.

<date>1524882031410< /date><review>So I sign in as usual and then I had to wait an hour when there wasn't anyone really there. Customer service is actually bad. Didn't notice me or address the situation until literally 40 minutes later. Haircut is usually decent but this time I asked for two inches cut and they went over board. I would suggest going somewhere else. Not to mention the price is $35 and up for a whatever haircut.<//review>< gmapID>

I had gone upstairs at the Westfield and gotten a cut at Edge Up. I got a rookie who gave me a terrible cut, so I went downstairs to Barber Lounge and asked for someone to fix up the cut. I got a barber named Larry who pushed my lining all the way back! Got my looking like Hey Arnold . The lining is so uneven and not crisp. Even worse he STUNK the whole time! I felt like I needed a shower after my cut. After all that he had originally said it would cost $15 for a touch up, but ended up trying to charge me $30. I paid $25 at the end of the day. The concept of the shop is cool and the receptionist was friendly and sympathetic, but overall I would NOT recommend this place.</review></record>

<review>Barbers make their own appointments outside of Barber Lounge. If you walk in expect 3  or 4 people to go first and they will get to you after they have completed their own personal booking. To boot, they look at you like you are crazy for inquiring.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Went to get my beard done here because my barber was busy that day. Ask for a certain type of line and fade that I usually get and I don’t think the barber was paying attention. Mustache wasn’t even lined up. Incomplete beard fade and lineup for $25... no thank you on returning.<//Text><user_id>112037602833160786837<//user_id>< Resp>

<Text>So the barbers are really cool and professional. But their is this gay guy that works the front counter, he always has an attitude whenever I come in and talks loud as he'll and very extra dramatically gay for no reason. I have nothing against gay people but this guy will make your skin crawl. So freaking extra and disrespectful.  He acts like I should be working for him.  I wish I knew his schedule so I would never go when he is there. If anyone else goes when he is there you will agree with my post. Again not hating in gays, I just don't like his gay disrespectful wanna be Beyonce attitude. Absolutely repulsive!!!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2b0ab6546fecd:0x7808cd40bce1b340</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I wish I had read the reviews. Shame on me. I was looking for a barber that cut women's hair. The young lady that greeted when I when in to check it out was professional and referred to a barber Larry, with appointment after work.  I get there  after 5:00 different recptionist/ bartender..the music was blaring loud and was rap laced with profanity and other degrading language.. if thats what yiyou u listen too personally ok.. but not in a professional  enviroment.  i asked was the barber in she said no and he was out running an errand  so at 5:45 I asked she said she was trying to call he was not picking up. Had to ask another barber,he called and he was in the food court...😲. I should have left..damn for not following my gut.  He apologized when he got there.   I wont go back.. did not get the cut I wanted kept having to guide the process. I know I have thin spots an experience barber would have been able to work around it.  I had to get home and tweek it , Not a good experience.   Just say no!!🤣🤣🤣👀👀</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Terrible experience. Drink selection limited, and my barber Jeff did not listen to my instructions. I didn't like how they used the hairspray without asking me beforehand. I left feeling quite disappointed with my haircut.</Review>

(Translated by Google) the idea is good enough to combine barber with drink .. obviously the barbers have to get to know each other more .. and I allow myself because I am an Italian hair stylist and we work with great precision and knowledge .. 55 dollars are a little too many x the service ..

I agree with the verbal consensus of other guests; that being ‘homey’ and customer-friendly.  The room and beds were great!  It was clean and clean-smelling.  The view of the pool and fire-pits were framed by the rising 6,000 mountains and lush, purposefully-placed and trimmed Palms.  The hotel staff, to the person, were like family, and most willing to accommodate our wishes.  All this, made our 50th anniversary trip into a beautiful memory that we will cherish for years!  ...coming back next year!

Very dated.  No frills.  Beds were fairly comfy and the location is good.  They need more parking.  It was comprised of mostly younger people just like anting to use the pool.< /Text>

<Review>Just a block from the main street downtown. Covid protocols being followed. Rooms are decent sized, clean and nice. Spa lotions, soaps, shampoo/conditioner.  Grounds are very well kept,  clean and colorful.  Fantastic pool (9a-10p), firepits lit in the evenings. Hard to find breakfast places open right now, and many places close early during covid.< /Review>< GmapID>

The online pics show beautiful rooms with balconies. In reality, the rooms not at all like the pics. The room was clean but dated - very dated. The "balcony" to my room was really a shared exterior corridor that guests take to their rooms. The pool was as advertised.</Text>

<Review>All of the workers at this hotel are great! In order to make my stay easier, they all go above and above. Give your workers great credit, please. It has been terrific. The service is top-notch, as always. Warmth should not be tackled in bed. The hotel's meals are enticing. The overall infrastructure is superb!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The parking is atrocious. Nice hotel, and this review would’ve scored higher if we were just a family of slugs that never left the hotel, but we go out and do things. A lot of things. So we always get in late. Well, this is definitely not a great hotel in terms of parking space for that style of vacation. I had to park on a dark side street both nights of our stay, which was a little creepy. I know most people are fine with that, so keep in mind it really is a nice hotel. I just hated the parking.<//review>

This hotel needs some updating. The bathroom are dated & the shower pressure is horrible. They put us in the main hotel room # 150 off of the lobby. It was very noisy. The patio looked out on the parking strip and the street. The beds are very hard and no Luxury sheets here. The hotel is in a good location close to shops and restaurants. I would not stay at this hotel again.<//review>

Walking distance to almost everything you would want in Palm Springs. The pool is heated and the deck area is great during the day and evening.

As with some other reviews, my only complaint is the rooms themselves. They have everything you need, but they are quite dated. The insides of the rooms really don't fit the outside of the hotel. All things considered, it is affordable and centrally located, so not much to complain about.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

This is not a 'resort', its a glorified motel.
Rooms are outdated, probably clean but look dingy.

Bed frame makes noises every time you move.

The landscaping around the property is nice.< /text>

I liked that “old” Palm Springs vibe, like back in the 1950s day.  Also:  close to downtown PS restaurants and shops, lovely, well-maintained property, quiet, ample parking.What I did not like was trying to find the room.  I wandered around the property for a long time before I found Room 145, which was tucked away in a corner.  I logged many steps on my iPhone and that’s ok.  I think signage could be improved.This was an overnight stay for me, and although the room wasn’t luxurious, it had everything I needed for 1 night.  It was very clean and the bed was comfortable, and a good rate.  I would put a light weight blanket on the bed; there was only a top sheet and a flimsy coverlet.  At least put a blanket on a closet shelf for guests to use if needed.It was a great place to stay for 1 night and just minutes away from the airport.< /text>

I wish I could say that we enjoyed our stay, but it was unfortunately not the case.  Far from it!However, I must emphasize that the overall experience with the staff and cleanliness of the hotel was suburb! Our neighbors? A NIGHTMARE!  The guest in 231 decided to get belligerently drunk, managed to loose their room key, while blasting their music through a Bluetooth speaker and continuously knock on our door (232) to enter.  After 10 minutes, we contacted the front desk and the representative was extremely helpful in diffusing the situation. We even filmed the interaction, from inside of our room.When 1 of the 2 guest returned to their room, to aid the one that was laying in our front door, it took them at least 5 minutes to enter their room with the newly issued key card. At this point, we were simply relieved that they were in their room and order had been restored... Not the case! The couple got their second wind, and the music was loud and clear.We gave up on our stay, and migrated to a different hotel at around 2am.Best Regards,Leslie T</text>

Dog friendly room was not very nice. We asked for a different room. Front desk upgraded us to a larger dog friendly room. Not much better. Rooms were very dated with brown carpets and brown sofa. Easier to clean I suppose. Staff was pleasant and helped where they could but rooms were not what I expected at a "resort and spa".<//review>

The hotel was conveniently located downtown, the room was spacious, with very soft bedding. In particular, our concierge who checked us in was amazing. He is very professional, warm, and even provided us complimentary late check out as we were celebrating an anniversary! Everything was clean and comfortable in the rooms. I know we will return next time. I strongly recommend this hotel!< /text>

<Text>Great location in the heart of Palm Springs just off of Palm Canyon Dr. Nice property, though the rooms are dated and could use an upgrade. Rooms are clean and the bed was comfortable. Did not use pool or hotel amenities. The pool did look nice. Best aspect of the hotel is location and proximity to shops and restaurants, which are only a couple of blocks away. Would stay here again for the right price.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkksBo-7iH6OY_CfgFMf-bippywbjH8do83ivF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPe1C3aCIpdrKz2OTyQo6WXQ5W-4xk2u954-maa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlWqi1y_mAKtOwze0Yl0IwKrZ2ZzGurps6rMsy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKLftuEsNrrHvG8WeETeNs4GYXCYE2kHdw9VLc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnU_NV1NgzIQ1-WnTaWl7Bn0p7DklPG7YAPKIo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXEpjAE1HRjmeb16eD0V3I_6_SCpgFjFNE66ZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOapWbRTEMGYbgWQfzDG-abqSEB6hDVE-BHS0n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvJIsP8_P8GVCQTqELRIck8cyWxqgkmQ_hxnz4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlfBNaFtS9uuE7YB7GCCxhNG-BjiftEZNM0l2E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxtjWLJg-_Rq176DEQIDDBcYxooDbWyNmKEeWa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

My daughter and I spent spring break at Palm Mountain Resort and Spa.  We loved it!  We didn't rent a car as the hotel has a free shuttle to and from the airport.  Many restaurants and shops are located on Palm Canyon Drive which is within a block of the resort so we were able to walk everywhere we needed to go. We felt safe while walking.  The pool and hot tub were awesome!  We were always able to get a lounge chair - no matter what time of the day we went to the pool. Our room had a balcony overlooking the pool which we enjoyed.  Our room was clean and we had no concerns. Each room has a safe which is nice to have.  We will be going back!</text>

The photos do not show the reality of the hotel. Upgrades are extremely necessary - the bedding was torn, the room smelled musty, very dim light, old furniture. The outside looks nice - pool + palm trees, but the inside felt like a huge disappointment.

Unfortunately the customer service wasn’t great either. The front desk seemed stressed and wasn’t very kind or helpful. They were actually quite cold which was not a pleasant start to our trip after hours on the road. We also had to wait an hour to check in - and they told us they would notify us but they never did so we came back after killing some time to make sure we weren’t forgotten.

We also requested blankets every night because it was chilly and the beds only a sheet on them - possibly due to covid? - but it took quite a while (40 min) to receive our blankets. One night the blanket was actually seemed very sticky, rough, and didn’t feel fresh so we had to ask for another one.

The key cards didn’t work to enter the property’s gate so we had to either wait for people to walk by one night and we called security the second night of our stay.

We also weren’t the only people who had a disappointing experience. A couple  - who opened the door for us when we were locked out - expressed to us that they were not happy with customer service or their accommodations either. We thought our issues might have been a one-off but it seems that others also were unsatisfied.

We were really looking forward to our stay at Palm Mountain especially since we paid a decent amount for the holiday weekend and read some great reviews online - but we were completely underwhelmed with what we got. While Palm Springs was a nice getaway, this hotel was a huge pain point throughout the trip. It’s unfortunate that the more time we spent away from the hotel the better our experience was.

Two out of five.<//text>

The best part of the resort is the customer service. If you need anything, they are readily available to make sure you are satisfied with your stay.

I agree with some of the other comments. The rooms could use an upgrade.</review>

The rooms are clean and kind of remind me of a spanish hacienda. The property is nice and secure, however they have zero amenities besides a pool. The pool area is nice, but it’s gated in and surrounded by bushes which gives the whole place an apartment feel. There is not a bar or any type of food service or a restaurant on site. When we asked about this, we were told that the main strip is so close that they don’t need all of those things. It was an okay stay..... Palm Springs is known for having a fun, yet relaxing get away vibe. I’ve stayed at many hotels in this area and this place was boring and very basic to say the least. They’re going to have to liven it up a bit and bring in more amenities before I’ll stay again.</Text>

<review>Nice resort walking distance to all of the restaurants, bars etc... Once in your room it states $25 fee for pool towels not returned. Also if you exit out of your room from patio entrance the door does not lock behind you. So if you plan of leaving for the day exit from front door. Friendly customer service. Various games to play. Corn hole, jenga etc... Pool is nice but small. You can have alcoholic beverages if they are in can or cup. Pretty much once you arrive at resort you don't need to worry about driving anywhere you are so close to everything. The pool stays open pretty late and opens early. The rooms are nice and include a microwave and small refrigerator. Pretty quiet rooms. I will most likely visit again.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtyzWoJjcdjRzQMiuILJwvauYvcABN6ppzfzeu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN6scr2J7cW9JqPNJRcojQtPLaGKQds1lMYaB7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

<Review>Stayed here with my wife for an after-backpacking getaway. Very nice. Staff was friendly, room was clean and well-appointed. Pool area is clean and well kept, but there are a lot a kids flying around. If you are a no-kids couple looking for a quiet afternoon by the pool, you may want to look elsewhere. We noticed the kid population was heavier in the late afternoon hours than in the earlier hours. Overall it was a lovely stay, but definitely more geared towards families with kids than adults.<//Review><Rate>4<//Rate>< date>

<rate>3</rate><text>It's a 6.3 hotel if you're experienced. Adequate is the word. Location is 10/10.

But;

- no late checkout (COVID excuse)
- resort fees (lol)
- pool towels are tiny in room not at pool
- sagging banner at pool (no love or effort)
- bad wifi like not good
- rooms adequate but dated (thin walls)
- some lights in room didn't work
- front desk service just 'is'. Like a 6. Adequate. Yuck. Zero welcoming-ness about the staff. Seems like it's their job, not passion.

This place is lacking love. It's a 'resort' that just doesn't seem to care much. It rides on it's location. It's nothing special what so ever. If you're looking for the SPA refresh stay in Palm Springs look elsewear. This is not bad though either. Even the pool music had a radio advertisment come on, like what?! Some vanilla music channel, no pool vibe at all. Family place. Maybe the manager needs to get reinspired. Also yay I get to enjoy the pool a bit extra and drive home to LA covered in sweat 💦 because they can't extend check-in an hr. Lame. Give back the resort fee then. COVID has become a major excuse for limiting effort I find. Lazy. Cleaners didn't get to my room to after 12 anyway.

This morning I asked for milk for cereal in lobby cantina receptionist didn't even look me in the eyes and to me to 'hold on' while who knows what she was doing instead. Felt like I was burdening her to stand up, I just told her to forget it and left. No one else was there. Ya, put some love here and fix service and it could get to a 7.x place. Maybe even high 7's. Put some money in to the dated patios and rooms, even an 8.x.

Wouldn't stay again at the moment. It's a 6.2 and a 6.5 due to location. So let's call it a 6.3.

And to be fair, if you're not fussy or particular or expecting much, or ever stay nicer palces, maybe you can make an argument it's a low 6.9 or 7, just not to me, it is. So calibrate your expectations accordingly.</text>< pictures>

Can't be the location.  Right in the middle of downtown. The check in team was ok, perhaps someone called in sick that day but there was a long wait to get checked in and they weren't super friendly, ehh?!?  They were definately short staffed perhaps due to COVID.  I would've given this spot a 5 stars but the doors and handles in the rooms need to be replaced or cleaned really really good.  The bathroom 🚻 was clean but the door was yucky, it was wood and they either need a good scrub down or just replace them all together.  We stayed in room 207 over looked pool and they had nice music was piped in which was nice. The gates on the property were difficult to get in and out of. These items were not deal breakers but we did bring our Lysol wipes and spray (Always do)  but worth noting to management.  Seems like such an easy fix 🤷‍♀️<//Text>

<username>Toni Watson<//username><text>Nice staff at the front desk, beautiful lobby area, and the room like a cottage, very nice
room, and decor was spot on, classy place. It's too bad all the beauty and service
somewhat 'disappear' when you try to get into the swimming pool, who would want to?
The pool was packed, the pool party had very loud music (in a foreign language) loud
guests, the spots were saved with towels over chairs, you don't have a chance
to use the pool here, it spoiled the visit. The pool party went right up to 10:00 p.m. when
they close.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<time>1510249481099</time><rate>4< /rate><Text>We have stayed here 2 years in a row now for our annual Mom - Daughter Desert Get away.  The location of this hotel is what makes it a standout in the area. Just steps (1 block) away from all the shops and restaurants of Palm Springs. We were able to walk to coffee in the morning, and dinner at night. Parking was easy to find at noon when we arrived on a Wed. We got the parking spot and never had to move the car until we left because the location is so good. Customer Service was great. The first year we arrived early and the room was not ready, but they let us change into our swimsuits and enjoy the pool. They called me as soon as the room was ready.  The second year we arrived at the same time, however the room was ready and for $20 extra we got to get into our room and settle in early.  The pool area is calm, not too many kids around making noise or splashing. They did have music, but the speakers were not very good and we could barely hear depending on where we were around the pool. I also had to ask them to turn it on one day. The pool was always clean and we never had to fight for chair space. The first year room (203) was perfect for us. Microwave and fridge allowed us to go buy snacks and drinks. We would eat breakfast on our balcony with coffee, and then take a pool break to our room for lunch (usually leftovers) and only dined out for dinner - making the trip even more affordable. The room was older, but it had charm like the slatted windows out to the balcony. The closet was big with mirrored doors so it made getting ready at night easy for 2 girls - no fighting for mirror space. The balcony was small with 2 chairs and a table, but it was perfect for enjoying coffee and breakfast in the morning. There was a grapefruit tree right off the balcony area - wish they were ripe! The bathroom was the area that could really use an update..... but it was sufficient for our needs.   This year our room was on the backside 3rd floor room 314.  These rooms were slightly bigger, but for the most part the same layout.  In the entry there was a funny small ledge but it worked out good for our drinks and snacks and stuff.  The biggest downside to this hotel is that it has no restaurant..... nothing!  They were in the process of adding a little store of some sort while i was there this time.  It really needs a little restaurant with bar where you can get something. Not really bad for us though because we got to enjoy restaurants every night instead. I would definitely stay here again, probably in Oct for the next girls trip!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeoeXIJaL6fcag-2DdhhWMhz6DWE3QkOE5g119=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZKptjvULPtyzHBD4PcwkljAXCqhYmfG4PlaXI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFmeW_r-fjbWynx_Xd3ari-2gbUFAz44oyz8IM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOflS1XYrOdyk__sYCBTB330olNWp4Tm3iT-Mr_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiMYwChA2TXorA5XiFyr3PNqZFvTBeLsJHS59H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuOVRAkHa_klQwoxdRO4bgUMjucD_8jW4eGvCE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCLCHJSNhJL6CF5taGLgVraw7yCT7nTZqGKqD_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEgRLHd9idjCj9IU1hroGDe2re9oNIFeNBaHj-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKI-TS4oHVg_9_8ge2oTBEIiIpCGQj0tMHec60=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwaMdzwjGbbWDCSz_171lVIqtCnUbZ-z2t5ee4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk3rN3a0WbhBbS_Aygh-IbsQPkwi_oVEeHM25n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsPUbAIs1d3PoDfhm3VDD_hv1c2BDTeLKFI5mQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPid4tAP2aLYHwqcuBOg7P1tDu5wQhpOl64AGUq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNroZT_yj1DK3--Yo1LCag96RLCnf-YyXvsuhZv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBsGBGt-8_ES5oODHq9cLJ_zakS4wfbBTiL401=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrFWaNm4w7jBG6upbddeeyOuER7OBcNOC3ahC_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPifQM0LYf6f9goaSTGsjV6b3LtF3QuDuA0KG4-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9gZnxxtHpycI7QSVS_cMp32PYK_GzZDgjeeUh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbfDBOZ_aiWilg-cnwgwiwckhtdYLO0DblPd2J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5MAgW8YIqpw_LGEmd5cTerH7Q-tFFPmv7P3Pd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW95htKGIuzHlnyg8F6ou8_gFWqNkZY-X5hYfJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMACuGsqb5TE79n4Mii2H74sTXEd6QCJBy1-iM5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkZEdCl8Dpc441ILmoIOwsilBSfHBNMSy0XP93=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0mXNnMtvTBCk5kCM6LdxDXE83mLRijCXIPexT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbPskN4-lsXrYT3BW9wyAI1_KmmFHrQ2A1DbYh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP_I07El9PhWyu-yYNgoBtP4b1_pG_oS_Fl3iu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3nqUaunHv2rTPJyvks04V2adom9iWwjN2BJLG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNae0FTWYMKRZnlmLdGqnHo7lQIutstYGdN2gv8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6TaYc6E9Yxtuod4m-g6hnrIZ9Cb4sDlNLDigD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5MUcfvPCabr9GwZg-Xiuy2srriF-EGQ7p_Gy6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFjG_3YXj9BPzjITdz0V3fYgRqXKelZDwyCGNO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpoxSvSuPFQ4ajT74UVkUdu9-2Q5jJyBXWzP8v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTQKqAMfsoMCDNsSlzoAQQwi4__ywcUuBfxCYe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9PlFIlhByOJz3BFhjaz8oYVYZMD2CE_x-1UbV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9c8hKtE94FsPLEUPsyhtHys9uM-9q4XZkI--f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnnP8mk9-gIImvNaPNoruECdXbDuWhBgqZJV1-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaYwqTVxYavKqoxqFkq6SXqXrO_5DZscI2sbSc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcXscnTQHqJicppPCdtOgbWKex0emLegrQAHI5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

<Review>Do not stay here. This place has so many issues. We paid extra for a patio room and the patio was in total disarray. Broken umbrellas torn cushions and very dirty. In the room the lamp shades were bent and half the light bulbs were out it made the room look like the Bates motel...scary. Same with the plug sockets we had to share one socket for recharging.  There were no wash cloths or soap and the shower had very little water pressure. Half of the ice machine didn’t work we had to loop around the building every time we needed ice to see which ones were going to give us a pittance of ice. One machine had the cover off with the electrical area open for anyone to touch. At the pool we watched several people struggling with broken umbrellas and not having enough umbrellas for the amount of lounge chairs. Also our patio was supposed to have a fire pit which it did not so we searched for another one and both nights it wasn’t working. Pictures show the patio and fire pit that was torn apart and broken umbrellas. We called management several times they attempted to clean, fix and deal with each issue but honestly it ruined our girls get away. We will never come back here.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1617145340938, 'text': "Thank you for choosing the Palm Mountain Resort and Spa on your recent visit.

Instead of individual soaps and shampoos, they had bottles installed at the sink and in the shower. There was a large dresser, a closet with an iron, ironing board and safe. I would definitely stay there again.</Text>< pics>

Also we were told we would have a balcony but we’re given a dismal patio with no view and a ratchet patio door that didn’t seem safe.</review>

<review>Spent a lovely three days at Palm Mountain Resort when I was in town for a conference. Would have loved to extend my stay to enjoy time at the hotel and take advantage of the resort and spa facilities.

Hotel is a 15 minute walk from the convention center and the hotel also made the shuttle van available for us. Complimentary van service is also available to and from airport during certain hours. Confirm availability when making reservations. Airport is less than 15 minutes away.

Rooms are comfortable. My only complaint was the mattress which was super firm. I was in a two bed room on the third floor facing the mountains. All rooms have some type of balcony or patio space with chairs available. Wall safe mounted at comfortable height in closet. Breakfast bar with coffee machine, microwave and mini fridge. Small table also provided in room.

Bathroom clean with plentiful hot water. Loved the scent of the provided soaps, lotions and gels.

Outside amenities, pool, hot tub and fire pit, comfortable and spacious. Pool was spotless. Hotel lobby had small seating areas with board games should you happen to have time to enjoy.

All the staff I interacted with were friendly, helpful, and accommodating.<//review><userid>105450274603581324192< /userid>< Time>

So the “resort charge” for “free phone calls , WiFi”, etc. is absurd. There were no food offerings. When I checked in I wanted a drink... also not available. Although at check out I saw they did have a “market” (like Hampton Inn).  Rooms are a remodeled Motel 6 style. Clean but very old under the carpet, smells old. Less than impressed.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>Great resort, in the heart of downtown. I love that it is so close to everything and youre right next to Starbucks. I didn't give it 5 stars because it felt more like a regular hotel than a "resort and spa" Their shower makes a noise while you shower, its not a big deal, but it should be fixed. It wasn't just my room because I could hear the neighbors shower doing the same thing.  On that note, that was the only thing I heard from the neighbors, you can't hear them talk or anything like that.< /review>< Pictures>

I wanted to love staying here but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. 9/10 times the key card would not work to open the gates at the property and I was told “well sometimes when it’s closed too hard you have to swing the handle upwards” maybe that would have been useful information to be told at check-in. Also, when our key wasn’t working, my husband and I waived over employees to please open it and I showed them my room key. They proceeded to speak in Spanish, not knowing my husband is a fluent Spanish speaker, and they were talking amongst themselves saying how we are going to break in and try and steal from people’s rooms. My husband is dark-skinned so this was extremely offensive. I was going to complain to the front office but my husband advised me not so we could enjoy the rest of our vacation, but I absolutely had to write a review. The cherry on top was when I found a three inch roach in the shower during my last morning. If I wanted roaches in my room, I could have paid a quarter of the price to stay at a motel. Won’t be returning<//Review>

<text>Nestled near mountain range near downtown. This resort actually really clean and  nicely landscaped. A lot of rooms. Almost every room is looking towards the pool. Are room was good size and we had a basic room. Came equipped with a fridge and microwave. Bed and pillows were heaven, felt like I never left my own.

<Review>Customer service was excellent.  The 3 rooms we reserved were very clean and the air conditioning was very cold.  Could use a bit more lighting by the pool at night.   We had a great time there.< /Review><Date>1594235156028</Date><user>106936609522912322540<//user>< user_name>

<Review>I went there a week ago and it is awesome, I got to go to the pool everyday and the lady in the office was nice enough to let us stay at the pool for an hour after we checked out.

The location was great. Everything else was below average. Staff was rude and could care less about the smelly room they assigned me. If you book from an outside source like orbitz, they will not address any issues. Pool wasn’t clean. Kids packed in there.. no social distancing whatsoever. Walked by the same overflowing garage cans the the 2 days we were there. Pretty disappointing experience to say the least.</text>

<text>Honestly for the price of this place I expected a little bette. The building is really old and the walls are very thin so we could hear everything from the other room even them snoring at night. I would probably pay a little bit more and stay at a more recent place.< /text>< pictures>

Clean, comfortable hotel with great AC and enjoyable pool area. Also doing a great job with COVID infection control, cleaning frequently and enforcing masking rules with guests. A little worn in places, but would definitely return!<//Review>

#2 Location, location. Location. This hotel is in the heart of the buzz with good food and bars steps away.
#3 The Pool with great mountain views is perfectly placed for hours of sunbathing and swimming. There are a couple of social spot for games. Several fire pits.
My only major critique is that the rooms could use an overall upgrade. I did not feel like I was in a resort. I did feel that I was in a moderately clean space hotel. Felt safe. Great stay otherwise.

If the furniture and amenities had an upgrade, this spot would be divine!< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>This time it was ok, my friends and I always stay here. I have had my reservation since June 2020 and I paid over $400 for 2 nights, a very expensive trip. I say that because there are really no amenities, no drinks or food at pool etc. You can bring food and drinks to pool but then your going back and forth. Also the Jacuzzi was not open, I get it, but would be nice to go in it at night.  The pool got a little crowded at times being that we have to social distance but that's the chance we take. The room is ok, new carpet a plus but could use a remodel. Next time we want to stay in the big suite over looking the pool, I feel that I have spent enough money to stay in a ok room that I can stay in a suite! The staff is great! Thank you</Review>< Pics>

Nicely decorated hotel but some rooms are directly off the parking lot and therefore you have noise coming in at night.  Also, the room charges you $25 per bottle if you take some toiletries so don't do it.</text>

<review>We stayed at Palm Mountain Resort for 3 nights recently. The strongest feature of the hotel is its location. All of downtown is within walking distance giving access to numerous restaurants, bars and shopping.

The rooms are outdated with limited amenities. Each room is equipped with a mini-fridge, coffeemaker and microwave. In our room, the fridge was dead when we arrived. It was promptly replaced. The coffeemaker worked once and then died. It too was replaced.

The property was generally tidy and the room was clean. But the furnishings have definitely seen better days. The in-room air conditioner was clanky and noisy, though functional.

Due to COVID19, the bar and dining were suspended at the time of our stay.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1596154449581, 'text': "Thank you for choosing the Palm Mountain Resort and Spa on your recent visit.

<text>Omg I just loved this place sooooo much. I’m on my way to the airport now and just had to write this before I forgot. The location is perfect and near all restaurants and the staff here is sooooo helpful and kind. They always had a smile, let us check in early since our plane arrived at 1pm and there is a free shuttle to the airport and gym. Anyway I can’t wait to come back here again! The pool is lovely too</text>< Pictures>

<text>Booked for 3 nights, when we went to go to bed the first night found that our sheets and pillow cases had blood in them. This is after we had to check in late because of the extra time needed to clean our room with COVID precautions. Told the front desk, they got us another room, last night in the room and drop my phone and it goes behind the end table, and there’s condom wrappers. Thought it was a nice hotel because of the price but pretty disgusting this stuff can happen.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1598657390802, 'text': "Thank you for choosing the Palm Mountain Resort and Spa on your recent visit.

<review>Very close to all the fun, food, entertainment, and shopping right next door! I was impressed with how helpful the stuff was, and how clean the rooms were. The only negative I have is parking, came on a holiday and it's very hard to find free, all day parking near the hotel.< /review></record>

<Review>Pool and jacuzzi are really nice here, the room is a bit dated, but that's the only complaint. The hotel staff here were very accommodating allowing us a 1pm late check-out. Location is perfect for a downtown Palm Springs vacation. We'd probably stay here again, but would look for a better deal on Priceline or Trivago. We booked through points and paid a little too much (we think). Resort fees are $20/day.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOKSBYeFu_Mp2PuNA3TsSFsEWiPufoeHp1lioo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

It was okay.  Not sure I would call it a resort.  One pool, one hot tub.  Not much else to justify the extra 'resort fee'.  Coffee available to buy in the lobby. No bar. No restaurant. Room was fine but there was hair and dirt behind the loo.  Shower squealed like a stuck pig and there fridge compressor was very loud in the night. We stayed at the quality inn down the road for $70 less and they had waffles.<//text>

Positive: The hotel was great! I loved that they had actual shampoo, conditioner and shower gel inside the shower. The small travel sized are never enough. The pool was great. Negative: The pool water was a bit hotter than usual.</Review>

Friendly staff. Rooms are older and somewhat noisy and not all have access to an elevator. Could definitely use a few upgrades. Pool was good and you can byob. Views of the surrounding hills is nice. Location has great access to downtown!< /Review>

<Text>Just got back.  Reading through the reviews, I can agree that the outdoor areas leading to the room are somewhat older and maybe a little run down, but it's a 60 year old building, which is part of what gives it a classic feel.  I wouldn't trade this beautiful property, well-kept, great light lobby area with indoor outdoor space to hang around, as well as a lovely heated pool and hot tub. The whole property is secured with locking gates, lovely paths and landscaping, and citrus trees (mostly grapefruit) that you can pluck from---or just take from the large basket offered in the lobby.  I totally disagree that the beds are uncomfortable, as in our room both queen beds were as comfy as they get with four pillows of all sizes on each bed to suit side or back sleepers.  The staff was wonderful, and how nice to have a place that kindly locks up your luggage until you come back to take the quick shuttle to the airport.  They also picked us up very promptly when we arrived.  The location is absolutely ideal--how nice to be able to walk easily to the most popular spots in Palm Springs--a vacation from your car!< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNux_ptym_0o-vQUCyrRE-khbMnS0UGmUnvCkjg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1580428263064, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing the Palm Mountain Resort and Spa on your recent visit.

<Review>I wouldn't call this a resort.  It's old and outdated.  The pool is very small. There are no restaurants on site although there are within walking distance.  I will say it was clean and the staff was nice.  There is not enough parking for all the guests, so you end up parking on the street. All the lotions, hand and body wash, shampoo and conditioner have the same strong scent. It wasn't very nice.  No face wash. I wouldn't stay here again.< /Review>< gmapID>

Best spa service and massage I’ve ever received!! I came from out of town, straight from the airport, seeking a massage, a place to store my luggage, and a place to relax for a couple hours before meeting up with a friend. They provided all that and more. Free water, open access to the facilities while I waited for my appointment, an EXCELLENT massage that had me perplexed at how affordable it was, complimentary pool bag with towel, a voucher for free coffee or tea at the cafe, and to top it all off, a glass of complimentary wine. The staff were so nice, frequently checking to see if I needed anything even after my massage was done. Definitely recommend this spot for a day of spa and poolside relaxation.</Text>

<text>I really enjoyed my stay. Fantastic location, walking distance to everything. The hotel has a chill, low-key vibe which is what I wanted. There is no "bar" or pool bar so it's not a noisy party place. Helpful staff, comfy rooms and nice amenities. I only remove one star for the spa. I got a prenatal massage and there is no way the massage therapist was "highly trained" or certified in prenatal massage like the description says. They claim they use special pillows to make you comfortable but they are regular pillows. I've had a "true" prenatal setup before and this wasn't it. My therapist didn't really know what she was doing. I've gotten many prenatal massages before and this was the worst. It was basically someone just putting lotion on me. She didn't know how to properly drape and my whole butt was hanging out at times, so awkward. I said I had sciatica pain and she did nothing to address it. She had me sit up at the end which was really weird. Overall, didn't match the description of the service one bit. Don't offer it if you can't fulfill. Very disappointed.< /text><user>118254262315164689834< /user><Time>1579962080320<//Time>< Rating>

<Review>Friendly and welcoming staff. The pool and grounds are impeccably maintained. We stayed here last year in the same room so we can see that improvements were made such as fresh paint, new beds, new carpets, new furniture and new art. Still there are tired areas. The safe didn’t work last year and was still broken this year. The tub fitter has a huge bulge in it. The faucets are old and worn. Overall not a bad place to stay a few nights. Very close to great food and entertainment.</Review>< Pictures>

We had a very nice stay at this hotel.  The staff was professional and courteous and the room was quite satisfactory.   The pool area was a fun place to hang out and all the kids had fun.  It would be nice if the had a bar on site.  It is conveniently located near the main drag and a lot of restaurants and shopping.<//Review>

Fabulous location on a quiet street just off the main road. Grounds are beautiful, pool is nice, and the fire pits make a great gathering place at night. The only downside is that the rooms, while very clean, are a bit tired and in need of an update. If you don't care about that, I'd recommend this as a good place to stay in Palm Springs!<//Text>

But if I’m paying that much for a room, I do expect to be able to park my car. There was no parking when I arrived, so they asked me to park in the 4 hour parking lot across the street until they could get the bus lot cleared. I called the front desk and left my phone number and asked them to call me when the lot was cleared, as my daughter and I had plans for the day, and I wanted to move my car as soon as possible so that I wouldn’t have to worry about it. They agreed to call me. 3 hours went by, and I called them again, and they told me that the lot had been cleared. I told the lady that they said they would call me, and she replied rudely that shifts change often. I received no apology. Our plans for the day had to be moved around because of this, and it really put a damper on the first part of our getaway. I even sent an email before writing this review and waited a week with no response, and still not even an apology. The room was nice, but I will not consider them for our next vacation.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>The resort is in a perfect location downtown close to all the shops and restaurants. The rooms are kind of old but modernize with a refrigerator and microwave. The beds are comfortable. The pool area is very nice with plenty of lounge chairs.  Now the doors are very hard to open to you room   took us several times to get the door open which can be very frustrating.  The internet is non existent. Tried several times to log on with no luck. Had to use our hotspot off the phone to connect to our laptop.< /Text>< pictures>

The soaking pools were fabulous, but the property itself needs a lot of updating. I wasn't very impressed with the spa either. The restaurant was fairly decent; best breadsticks on the planet!

No, my review was NOT posted in error! That was my personal experience and at that property!! I see I'm not the only one who has given that feedback either.</text>

Not enough towel racks. Room is dated. The lack of anything resembling internet made trip planning on the fly sort of an impossibility. The only saving grace is the abundance of parking, the great jacuzzi and pool area, and proximity to the main street in town. Palm Mountain Resort leaves much to be desired.< /text>

We had a late arrival and the resort was quite full.  Unfortunately our room had 2 full beds when we thought we would have a single queen or king.  The room was clean but quite dated.  The pool looked inviting but we did not have an opportunity to utilize it or the spa services.It was convenient to downtown.  Parking was limited and we had to park across the street in a public parking lot.The gentleman at the front desk was nice enough.</Text>

Convenient location easily walkable. Rooms appear to be clean. However, rooms were not soundproof, easily to hear other guests speaking in normal tones.</Review>

I was very comfortable at this place. It's clean and crews are prompt in fulfilling guest requests. Because of their fluffy and full pillows my sleep were excellent. I noticed that not many hotels don't care to make sure pillows are important in a guest's sleep nowadays.</text>

<review>Great location! You can walk to everything from this hotel because it's adjacent to downtown Palm Springs. That being said, the hotel was clean could use some updating. The hotel itself is listed as a resort and spa but, there are no onsite  dining options and the spa was not open during our stay.<//review><Date>1578516343487</Date></record>

<Text>This place is great!!! Super friendly and helpful staff. Beds were plush and amazing!  The soaps, shower gel, shampoo, smell herbally delicious and feel amazing! Perfectly situated just beyond the strip. Will definitely be back.    4/5 only because it could use a bit if an upgrade in the building where my room was. ... other than that it was great!</Text>< Resp>

<review>All the staff were very accommodating and wonderful! Dory at the front desk took good care of us. The shuttle drivers were helpful as well. In the day spa they had great massage and facials! The room was clean,  and it was nice to have a mini frige and microwave in the room. The location is also very nice being right in the heart of Palm Springs!<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Great get away spot, right off the main strip in Palm Springs. You can walk to all the shops and restaurants. There are nice views of the mountain and city. The staff was friendly and professional, the hotel is very nice. The pool area is a lovely spot to chill out and swim. It was cozy and clean, everything worked in the room, which is important! I was able to do out on the town and easily walk back to my room no problem. I felt refreshed after my stay and definitely will be going back. There is also parking at this location, easy to get to.

Very nice staff from the front desk to the care takers of the property. This year I left my favorite swim trucks on the balcony and checked out. When I realized it, I called and they got me to the right person who verified my stay and the description of the shorts. They mailed them to me in Des Moines and only charged me the postage. (I know some hotels charge a service charge)

I have been staying here for years.  The property is centrally located in downtown Palm Springs.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  The pool area is also kept clean and the pool is always sparkling.  Each time I return they have added an upgrade of some type especially in the lobby area.  Great deal for the price and family friendly too!<//Review>

<review>I love that the parking is so close to our room. The receptionist was welcoming and very nice. 👍
Once we entered our room and settled for a bit, my wife and daughter had trouble locking the balcony door so I had them call front desk to send someone in for help. Some man showed up shortly (maintenance guy,maybe) and locked the door for us. Which I was thankful for. He then condescendingly told us to read the sign next to the door with the instructions on how to lock it. Geez, thanks mister! We could've done without the attitude 😓  The whole thing left us with a bad taste in our mouth for the remaining of our stay. I will not be booking at Palm Mountain Resort in the future.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Staff was very nice,  the hotel in general was calm and relaxing.  I feel if they are going to allow dogs they should enforce owners to clean up after thier dogs or take that responsibility. The little store was great,  more fruits would be excellent.< /Review>< Resp>

Perfect location.  Parking is not the best, But everything you need is within walking distance. I didn't drive my vehicle for 2 full days. Restaurants,  shopping,  everything is close.  Pool was great,  good place for kids. I'll be back!<//review>

Fabulous location just 2 mins walk to the main drag with many bars and restaurants. The rooms aren't fancy (more motel style) but they have everything you need and are very clean. The pool area is clean and has a spa where  you can bring your own beers/snacks.
The hotel loses 1 star because somebody broke open our car gas lid cover and siphoned our fuel in the middle of the night, the hotel listened to us but didn't go out of their way to help review the security camera footage. Unfortunately left a bad taste in the mouth, we thought everything else was great.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>Location, location, location! Palm Mountain Resort & Spa is perfectly located in the heart of where the shopping and action is in Palm Springs. There are numerous clothing stores and eateries within walking distance (if you can stand the heat!), and if you happen to be in town on a Thursday night, the Village Fest (kind of like a huge farmer's market with almost 200 vendors) is right outside the hotel. My only complaints: the beds were a little small and uncomfortable, the decor of the rooms was a little dated, parking can be difficult if the hotel is at or close to capacity, and check-in is kind of late (4 PM). On the plus side, the staff is friendly, and the spa was fantastic as well (my wife and I got a couples massage). In my opinion, this hotel is worth it if you get a good deal.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1531945361465, 'text': 'Wow, thank you for such a great review and rating.\n\nWe are so pleased you enjoyed your stay and the great location of the hotel.\n\nWe hope to see you again soon.\n\nTim - General Manager, Palm Mountain Resort & Spa'}</Resp>< Gmap_id>

My friend and I stayed at Palm Mountain Resort over the labor day weekend. The location is excellent, right in downtown Palm Springs. I like the fact they have games in the lobby (i.e. battleship). I thought it was fun. However,  I am giving 4 stars because the linen was soiled. Evidently, it had not been changed. My friend found a blooded mucus on her bed! It was very disgusting! We brought that up to management the following day. I am not planning on coming back again. Also, parkingis is limited and it can be a problem.</text>

<Text>LOVED the location. So convenient to downtown shops! The pool was very nice. However, the coffee in the rooms was icky ( small one cup cheap thing ) and you had to pay for coffee in the lobby. The rooms were adequate. If location is your priority, this is good.</Text></record></dataset><record>

If you are looking for a day spa for your skincare and body therapies visit The Spa at Palm Mountain Resort. It is a hidden gem in downtown Palm Springs.  You will experience a charming tranquil spa with wonderful, friendly staff to greet you upon your arrival. Tony greeted me and helped me with my registration and provided me information about my treatment and the spa. My therapist Tiffany was awesome………during March they have a special to upgrade for a complimentary add on using a golf ball to relieve stress and knots. Since I was having a deep tissue massage, I definitely took advantage of this special. I highly recommend Tiffany if you decide to visit the Spa at Palm Mountain…………she definitely was able to relieve me of my stress and I was completely relaxed when my massage was over. The spa has a local special where you can receive 15% off any spa treatment, complimentary 4th treatment after the purchase of 3 with your Tranquility punch card. Access to the Resort’s outdoor, climate-controlled pool, hot tub and sunning terrace anytime you visit The Spa for a treatment. When I checked out, I received my punch card and a card to enjoy a cup of coffee or tea from the lobby anytime over the next year. Truly an amazing experience!!< /review>

If you like a full pool, a small room, small beds, no parking space, lots of noise, an unfriendly reception and a free breakfast which should not carry that name...  This is the place to be on Saturdays in Summer. Location is great and it is much cheaper than the Hilton or the Marriot. Otherwise, stay away.</Review>

They do not serve any food (so no free breakfast) and their shuttle does not run for early AM flights so be prepared to pay for a taxi or uber to the airport if you fly out really early. Staff was friendly and helpful.<//Review>< Pics>

Great location, easy to to get to downtown and restaurants, great staff.  A little old but rooms were comfy and spacious. Pricing was good but probably due to construction.  Pool areas small. I would recommend, but wait till the construction is over.<//Review>

< Review>
Staff is super friendly and helpful. The pool is nice and it’s really close to the Fresh Fish Market which has fresh fish shipped in every morning from Santa Monica seafood. The room was great we had a poolside room which had its own porch and the room was very clean. They even had the air conditioner on as we came in on a very hot weekend in July. The staff was soooo nice they even shipped Hunters beloved giraffe to us that we didn’t see under the sheets when we left. We will definitely stay here again when it’s not as warm. Also good driving distance to local Wet N Wild water park/save $ ask at the hotel, tickets were only 27$/person which is cheaper than online. Happy Vacationing!!!!!</Review>

The location is perfect it's in the heart of Palm Springs walkable to restaurants,bars,cafe and shops. Employees are great they are nice and very helpful. Rooms are just OK, no gym inside the hotel which I find very dissapointing with the resort fee of $20/day. The pool and jacuzzi are so Dirty FOGGY and SALTY. Spent a few minutes on it and my EYES hurt so much. But other than that Great location and nice employees.<//Review>

I stayed here for a night 3-4 years ago.  The property was decent but the rooms were kind of worn out.  The pool and spa were great, and we had fun on the nice room balconies.  The staff were amazing and very accommodating.  The breakfast was very lacking and the dated rooms had slightly uncomfortable beds.  Overall I had a 4 star experience at a 3 star hotel.<//Review>

Beautiful rooms. Hotel is in a great location and the pool was a great time for kids and parents to relax. The balconies are huge too. Love the vibe and landscaping... & the paths etc.
The only thing that was an issue was the wifi is terrible.....it is a BIG issue for me because  the only means of communication and way to organize my travel for the next day because I'm not from the usa and don't have access to a data network.<//text>

<Text>Paid $250 for a night and got a room in one of the main blocks. The room was dirty, old, and really sad. Just a bed in a large warehouse style room. So dissapointed. Tried to find some other place to stay, but difficult during Coachella weekend. After complaining we got moved to a more quiet part of the hotel in the backyard. Was much better, but not really a "spa resort".<//Text>< pics>

Location is great. Walking distance to shops and food is just a couple of minutes. Rooms are comfortable and clean. They could use some updating but I can't complain just an observation. Great pillows. Pool and hot tub are nice. Pool is heated! Staff is very nice.</Text>

Rooms are a bit small...two full beds rather than Queens but the rooms were clean.  The pool area looked beautiful.  Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to use it.  They had a great fire table with seating for the cool evenings.  In the end, the only negative was the parking situation.  I had to park across the street in the city lot one night.< /Review></record>

The grounds are well cared for and our room appeared to have been recently remodeled. Each staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. We didn't use the spa in property but our room was supplied with lotion, soap, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel from the spa. There is a small "market" off the lobby for snacks, coffee, tea, cocoa and soft drinks. Our room did have a small coffee maker with supplies aswellas two complementary water bottles. There is plenty of seating around the pool and fire pit.</review><name>Barbara McClellan< /name>< Response>

Not that impressive. Rooms on par with an older Motel 6. Guy at the front desk argumentative.  be careful about on-site parking it's limited and you're forced to park your $62, 000 new car across the street in an open parking lot with everybody wandering around downtown. I'll be surprised if it's still there in the morning, thank goodness I have good insurance.  Will look for an alternative place to stay for my future visits to Palm Springs. Disappointed and frustrated best describes my experience.</text>

Slightly better than basic motel, but not much. Too few parking spaces, had to drive around for half hour to find one, one night. And for this they charge resort fee that supposedly included parking.</Review>

<Review>The check in process was SO uncomfortable due to Shermain’s awful customer service. Before driving up I called to make sure we could leave cash deposit as my boyfriend and I usually only carry cash. The lady at the desk, Shermain, was SO condescending. She was persisting we needed a card, we told her we brought cash for the deposit. The other check in lady was saying it shouldn’t be a problem to leave cash. Shermain rudely asked “Do you even have 100 for the deposit?” When we pulled out the 100 dollar bill she said “well I still need the card.” We went to the bank and deposited  to appease this request. Housekeeping barged in when we weren’t dressed without knocking. The pool was PACKED, as the picture makes it look way bigger. It was tiny and we didn’t even go in one time through our 3 day stay. When we checked out they didn’t ask about or stay or have any hospital things to say. We won’t be coming back here.<//Review>< pics>

Our stay was just for one night. We got to enjoy the pool for a bit, there was water for sale at the poolside and some guests had brought their ice chests with drinks of choice.

The room was nice and cold when we arrived. It was a good experience in a clean room, there was some renovations going on but it was mentioned prior to booking so, no surprises.

The only issue we had was that the shower curtain smelled a little funky and caused an unpleasant smell in the bathroom but it wasn't a big deal.<//Text>

<user_name>David Martinez</user_name><Text>Place was well kept. Grounds were nicely groomed, and the room that we stayed at was welcoming and clean (newer rooms?). Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, from the housekeepers to the management. Like I said above, an overall welcoming feel to the place. The room was super close to everything you might need to enjoy yourself. Coffee and beer, to breakfast lobster dinners. All is near, and local within walkingdistance. Just make sure to keep in mind the heat. Especially the very old and the very young. All are welcome on the pool seating was plentiful and comfortable. Towels were also provided for the pool specifically. It's my second year in a row returning to Palm Mountain Resort, and I can honestly say, im eager to return for next years visit.<//Text>< Response>

I recommend you that hotel without any reservation. The rooms are nice and the staff very welcoming. I also really liked the way the hotel is built, it is like a small village. So if you stop by Palm Springs, do not hesitate to book there. 🌴<//text>

<rating>2</rating><Text>If you're looking for location as the most important factor it's right downtown and we walked there everyday. but a good 15min drive from major stores or chain restaurant. The room was far from anything "nice". Cracked walls, small dark room, barely any privacy, super thin walls, outdated EVERYTHING, lime buildup in the shower, shower curtain was all torn up like a cat got to it, nothing seemed to be super clean. It was more of a motel than a hotel. There is a heated pool and hot tub at the "resort" which was nice but the room was FAR from worth it. I would have given it 1 star if it was just a little farther from downtown. So I'll give it that...you can tell all of their money was put into the everything BESIDES the rooms.room service was super loud and since the walls are thin they woke me up just by talking or cleaning the next room...spunded like they are right next to my bed. All in all I would never recommend this to anyone<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80db1ba5967e997b:0x2ea7360171a38fa2<//GmapID></record>

<Time>1545938963452< /Time><rating>1<//rating><review>Rented 2 rooms.  Friend had so many maintenance problems had to be moved to new room.

My room had broken glass on floor, pubic hair in corner of bathroom, very worn appearance.  Black cobweb type stuff on ceiling above fan my bed.  Had to use heater as weather wasnt warm but when heater was going a stale cigarette smell came with the heat so it was a balancing act to try to stay warm and trying to breathe.  No fan in bathroom.  Fixtures very worn, and on my last day shower handle broke off in my hand so I never got a shower!

Also no breakfast and everything to purchase very expensive.

I rented here based on star ratings but should have read reviews 1st as i would probably not rented here if i had.  This was my 1st time in Palm Springs so I didnt know.  Not a frequent traveler so I'm learning.

On the plus side, management was very good about refunding some of our room rate.

Even so I wont be back.  It was too much stressful travelling to have problems with the rooms.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1546320174553, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing the Palm Mountain Resort and Spa on your recent visit.

Been staying here for quite a few years very quaint place for the most part usually pretty clean has a refrigerator in the room in the microwave which is very helpful and is completely with him real quick walking distance to Downtown Palm Springs stay there just recently this is the first time I've ever really had an encounter with someone at the counter that was a little rude with me I'll definitely take that up with the assistant manager she's always been very kind of very fair with me and knows we might be named as I said I'm there a lot<//Review>

Older, no frills hotel. Their​ rooms are clean but desperately in need of an up date. 40" TVs are just too small for the viewing distance from the bed. Internet was sporadic and I kept losing signal when trying to work. Linens were high quality and the bed was comfortable.< /Text>

< Review>
Nice place!!! Great rooms, great service and a fantastic shower! Our room had a mini fridge and microwave even though we didn't ask for one so I would assume all the rooms do. We also had a nice little patio outside with a seating area right outside our room and the courtyard was lovely with a large heated pool and hot tub and several fire pits to sit down by. The location is nice too with plenty of restaurants, bars and shops within walking distance. My only complaint was that there was no complimentary coffee in the lobby. Coffee is provided in the market place in the lobby for $2 a cup (small cup) which you can have charged to your room or you can walk one block to Starbucks and get a larger cup of the same coffee for the same price.</Review>

What threw us off was that first we asked for champagne glasses and the girl tells us they don't have champagne, so we ask again for just glasses, and she tells us they don't have that either. Ok, I understand if you don't have either, but if a guest asks for champagne, you go get it and then charge them an arm and a leg for it. That's on them. Anyway, the next day we needed a safety pin, and they didn't have one..not even a sowing kit. It may be nitpicky, but they didn't even bat an eye to look for any of these items. I was afraid to ask anything else because it may have been in their training to just say "we don't have that."< /Text><GmapID>0x80db1ba5967e997b:0x2ea7360171a38fa2< /GmapID>< Pics>

<Text>The location was ok. There was a lot of construction taking place directly across the street and at the adjacent corner. The grounds of the hotel were decent, and clean but out of date. The rooms were small, the bathrooms were dated. The soap, lotion and shampoo dispencers were kind of an odd feature. Good luck getting a smile from any of the staff, or any assistance for that matter. Asking fir extra towels was like asking for a bar of gold. Calling the front desk for information seemed to be an inconvenience to the concierge. Parking is difficult and nothing is conveniently close to your room. Over all, you get what you pay for and the "4 star resort" service that comes with it.< /Text>< user>

< Review>
Relatively good price for being closely located to the center of the city. Literally just one block from the strip. The front desk is courteous and they deliver hand soaps upon my request. Strong AC in my room. The bathroom is a little jaded and the water pressure in the shower is weak. They do not serve food at all, incl. breakfast and room services. Only observation when I check in Friday evening is that one trash bin is not cleaned, no free bottles of water provided, and no hand soap replenished.< /Review>

<Text>Convenient near old downtown Palm Springs, but the place is in need of a renovation. The doors joining two adjacent rooms are thin or not well sealed so you can hear conversations in the next room. WiFi connections are spotty at best.

* UPDATE Dec. 2019 - For 3 years the staff has said they will improve the terrible WiFi in this hotel - it's still bad. One day I couldn't even respond to emails. *</Text>< Time>

This place sucks.  I just checked in.  Was supposed to get a Courtyard Room and got a corner room that has no view and it smells.  Carpet is dirty, room looks cheaply done.  Should have just payed the extra $50 bucks and stayed somewhere nice since I paid $250 a night for this place after taxes and resort fees. All I can say is don't do it!<//text>

<text>Extremely nice pool area and well located to the main strip of downtown Palm Springs. A three dollar credit per person at Ruby's cafe for breakfast which is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. The couch in our room needed replacement and the shower was a little weak. Bed was very comfortable.<//text>< Pictures>

Large poolside rooms with a huge 50 inch TV. No take away alcohol on sale for a mile. 7-Eleven is about a mile away. Pool area is clean with umbrellas, mist sprays and has about 100 chairs, is usually busy busy with loud chart music from the last 30 years pping out!</text>

<Name>Nick Sebastian<//Name><Review>From the moment we arrived, the hotel was a disappointment. We arrived at 2pm, but our room wasn't ready even though we notified them we were arriving early. They were supposed to call us when the room was ready, but they never did. Finally, at 5pm we were able to check in. The room was adequate, but needed remodeling. The swimming pool was filled with people and unusable. Parking was a problem, after coming back from dinner, the lot was full. No food was available on premise. Not even toast or cereal. The staff was snobish and indifferent. Worst hotel experience I have ever had in Palm Springs. The only redeeming feature was the location, very central. For $200 a night, off season, it ruined my entire vacation.< /Review><user_id>110981253515822084746</user_id>< date>

<text>Don't stay here now if you want a relaxing poolside getaway. Undergoing such unsightly and loud construction in the common areas that you can't hear your friends talk, so the pool would've been a nightmare. Then there's the fees. Take the quoted rate and then go ahead and add a literally 44% markup! !!! There's the nightly rate, then there's nearly 14% tax on that, then there's the resort fee, then there's the nearly 14% added on to that too! Adds up to a 44% markup from the online quote which is ridiculous and unacceptable. The nice rooms hardly compensate, so I'll be looking for a new resort to stay at on my next visit if I can.< /text>< name>

Rooms are spacious with comfortable large beds. They have tea/coffee facilities, TV, fridge,  microwave and a bath with shower fitting. Free Wi-Fi is included. There's an outside swimming pool.
The facility is tired and need of refurbishment, the bedroom carpet is badly stained, the window leaks when it rains, air con is very noisy etc.
Breakfast is "included" but turns out to be a $3 voucher for Ruby's Diner, which is 200 yards away.
So it's fine for basic accommodation but no more.</Review>

< review>
This review has been a long time in the making. We stayed as guests in May 2017. During our last night, someone broke into our hotel room and STOLE EVERYTHING we owned. Including: laptops, hard drives, guitar, clothes, wallet, car and house keys, credit cards, cash. It was $6,444 altogether. This was due in large part to the LACK OF SECURITY at the hotel. They have no video cameras around the resort, only in the lobby. They don't have security guards. And it is incredibly easy to sneak in or out of one of their many un-monitored entrances.

By the way, we WERE NOT THE FIRST TO GET ROBBED THERE. Check their yelp page's 1 star reviews, which there are MORE of than any other star rating: there's a review from 2014 of a guy who was robbed there with his WIFE: I actually got in touch with him, David L., and he had the exact same experience as we did. The hotel did not care. And it was clearly someone with access to rooms who had robbed him, as we know is the case for us too, which we can't prove because they don't have cameras in most places and they DELETED the lobby's footage from the night we were robbed. Uh-huh. They also denied showing us an employee list from the night we robbed. There's just too much fishy stuff going on at this place.

The hotel was ROBBED AGAIN, later this summer 2017, at gun point in their lobby. There is a news article about this online you can google.

Also, one last thing, we tried to speak to the general manager, Tim Ellis, after getting robbed but he didn't return any of our calls nor did the email provided to us for him work.

BELIEVE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. They are true about his place. Palm Mountain mis-represents everything on their site. Their rooms are old and do have a strange smell. There are bugs. There is very loud construction next door. Their staff were extremely unfriendly and unaccommodating -- straight up blaming us for being the victims of a robbery. The experience I had at this resort changed me as a person. Made me realize how little a corporation like Columbia Hospitality actually cares about their customers. Made me realize a fundamental truth about humanity: at the end of the day, businesses just want your money.< /review>

<review>The location is pretry nice and just a block from the main strip. Unfortunately, they didn't have a king bed available for us so we had to move rooms after the first night. The rooms are nothing special and there's no complimentary breakfast. The staff has been helpful though.<//review>< user>

Wasn't impressed. The rooms are dated & dark.  The parking is terrible & we had to park a block away on the street. There are no pool towels.  You get two in your room & are told they were inventoried when you leave.  Why is this called a Resort?  Other than being a pool & hot tub there were no amenities' not even drinks.  I did not try spa services.< /Text>

Make no mistake, the location is great.  Really right there downtown but one street off the main drag, so it's quiet.  HOWEVER, we were upset that when we arrived, we were told there was an $80 resort charge and they wouldn't let us check in (although the room was already paid for through expedia) without forking over the cash.  The room had terrible mattresses.  One of the beds was so bad that it actually had indentations where people slept on it.  You know, the mound in the middle thing.  Cheap details like no extra soap.  To use bar soap I had to change from the sink to the tub.  Ugh. Carpet was dingy, possibly just dirty, but worn nevertheless. There wasn't even a picture on the wall in either of the two rooms I purchased.  The photos on the website must be of some upscale room they keep hidden.  Front desk was sullen.  Overall, disappointing.  I won't stay there again.<//Review>

<Review>This place is OK. The rooms are alright but the pool area is crowded and loud. Really hard to find parking if they're fully booked for the night. The pool itself was fairly small and pretty dirty from the amount of people using it. You get what you pay for - this is an OK hotel if you don't plan on spending much time here, otherwise, look somewhere else.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Nice location, other than that nothing is good. Lot of bugs in the room. The room is too old and look more like a prison cell. Cracked painting, the restroom smells, some of the light bulbs are burned out.
The stuff isn't that friendly. Pool is not heated.....</review>

Relaxing hotel. Mostly older folks staying and it was quiet. There was no cpmplimentary breakfast, and I was hoping the rooms had more accomodations, but overall pretty good getaway. We had a massage and it was pretty good and conveniently close to the room and the pool.<//Review>

During festival weekends they treat guests like they're nothing but massive inconveniences who are lucky to have a place to stay, despite more than tripling the rates. Our door lock was broken for two days and we spent 45 minutes at 1am waiting to get in our room while the incompetent staff acted like it was simply us not knowing how to use key cards (the entire door handle had to be replaced twice). They blast tacky, elevator music at the pool and refuse to turn it off. They refunded the resort fee and gave us a late checkout to make up for it but we won't stay here again.</review>< rate>

THE WORST HOTEL YOU COULD POSSIBLY FIND, ROOM NEXT DOOR CAUSING ISSUES BRINGING COPS TO INVESTIGATE. FIGHTING, SCREAMING, BANGING... DEFINITELY DONT FEEL SAFE.
Broken microwave, outdated room, high resort fee, dirty pool.

1st experience but definitely last. Don’t even want to visit Palm Springs ever again.

UNSATISFIED, CANT SLEEP FROM NOISE & UNSAFE.

Nothing no one ever needs on a “VACATION”
Red spiders are everywhere!!! Im not sure if the pool is full of them because I’ve seen SOOO many of them all over me, maybe the bathroom etc

But seriously overall, so unsatisfied & disappointed.<//Review>

Staff discriminates if you're not apparently wealthy. Requires 2 week advanced notice for card authorization form. Checkin policies inconsistent, dated furniture and decor, rooms smell like cat urine from outdoor furniture being used inside.< /Text>

< review>
I booked this despite the bad reviews because everything else was sold out during the IW tennis tourney in March 2015.  We had low expectations, but were very pleasantly surprised.  They are under construction, so the check-in was in a temporary structure and no lobby, but otherwise the place was updated, comfortably laid out, and well maintained.  Room was updated with new beds, very comfortable.  New granite shower and sink had been installed in the older bathroom.   Nice patio with chairs within a 30 foot walk to the pool.    Pool was perfectly maintained, as was the hot tub.  Fresh towels placed on every lounge chair in the AM by the pool.  And working fireplaces with adirondack chairs where people gathered in the central area at night.   Staff was friendly and helpful.  Room was prepaid and there were no extra charges.   Location is great if you want to be near the main walking area of Palm Springs.    Maybe the parking was a bit inconvenient, as the lot outside the room was full, so we had to park across the street.

Maybe they improved fast before I got there, but I saw nothing to justify the awful reviews.   If I needed a nice convenient place, I'd stay there again.< /review>

< review>
Do NOT book in this resort if you're planning a family vacation! The staff here are EXTREMELY RUDE! A few of the kids from our family were in the pool playing and someone went to go complain to the front desk that they were being "too loud". The front desk sent their janitor to go yell at the kids. He told them to shut up and that next time he comes he's kicking them out. The fact that he was yelling and screaming at children that aren't his in the first place, is a sign that the staff in this resort are unprofessional. When the janitor came back again, he almost made on of the kids cry! So we went to go tell management that we don't want this strange man yelling at the kids for playing too much in the pool! Those kids have parents and the janitor should've gone to the children's parents first! And secondly, it's a POOL! Kids are supposed to have fun and play in a pool! It's normal for children to make noise and play in a pool! And children should not be reprimanded for that! And third of all, the resort had employees in the pool who were drinking beer and there was also a lot of other adults drinking beer and alcohol in the pool area! Those employees should be the ones to be reprimanded for drinking in a pool area! Overall, this resort is the worst resort I've ever been in. I do NOT recommend for anyone with children to stay here; better yet, I don't recommend for anyone at all to stay here. The staff are rude and unprofessional. Stay away from this place!< /review>

<Review>Really nice, centrally located in downtown PS. Everything is pretty much walking distance from the hotel. Restaurants/bars etc. Can't beat the location. Property seems to have been upgraded a bit in the last year or so. New outdoor fire pit and lounge area at the pool. Really nice! Also, a new outdooor lounge area up front adjacent to the main entrance. Also really nice! Our ground floor room was just steps from their heated pool. Room was super clean. Large king bed with super soft linen. Its been almost 2 years since we've stayed here and all these new suttle upgrades has really helped the property! Also, pool area very large with lots of area to get your suntan on!! LOL Great spa/jacuzzi too! Think this is our new go to spot in PS!!< /Review>< pics>

Good pool but the bedroom are not very good, the heater is too noisy, the room is not isolated, the bed are pretty decent, for the bathroom, the door is useless, the showerhead is so old I thought I was in a 60 movies. The housekeeping was good.<//Text>

There was a smell in the room but the pool facilities are nice.  There are no room safes so security is questionable. Does charge a resort fee which i feel is dishonest in general as that is what the room charge is for, especially for a property like this which is just a hotel with a pool.<//text>

Palm Mountain Resort is in a fantastic location in the heart of Palm Springs once you get to the hotel you can park and not have to drive again because you can walk to everything you need shopping and restaurants retainment.<//text>

I was not pleased at all with my experience at this place.  If I could I would give it zero stars, I would.  From a very unsafe parking lot (dirt, not gates, under construction and no direct access to facility) to access to a fitness center miles away from the place. It was loud, lots of drinking and smoking at every turn.  Then I arrived home and found an additional charge of $17.03.  When I called to inquire about this fee, I was told this was a resort fee.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Beware of the hidden fees!<//Text>

<UserId.>110774595441481090306<//UserId.><Review>We stayed here two nights for the Tour de Palm Springs event. When I first checked in while I waited my turn they handed me the "Rules" page of everything that would get you kicked out of the hotel. This seemed very odd to me and the only time I have ever seen something like that was in Havasu during Spring Break. The one thing that stood our of course was the NO BIKES IN ROOM rule, but given the event that was going on they made an exception for my bike. For the price we thought we would have gotten a cleaner room. The room was bare like something you would see in the middle of nowhere and dusty. Behind the dresser was a pasts guests dirty laundry something you could see right when you walked in. The TV Channels where all fuzzy and there were only a few to choose from. Having kids cartoons on are nice while you are trying to get ready. The bathroom was the only nice place to go. It was updated and clean something the rest of the room lacked. We did love the location and the grounds were very pretty. We were only a short walk to the Start/Finish line and all the great food Palm Springs has to offer. We probably will not stay there again.</Review>< response>

<review>Absolutely a waste of money! I came here with my Fiancé and child for a one night stay and the first room they gave us was described as haveing two rooms which was understandable for almost $400 dollars in reality it was an extremely small studio and smelled like an ash try giving our asmatic child breathing problems as soon as we walked in. We asked for a new room and they showed us a similiar one that only smelled like smoke when the ac was on! Every hotel was booked so we HAD to stay in it. Wake up and had The headboard fall of the wall which was held up by a half an in nail on each side ( headboard was solid wood) luckily no one was hurt. Husband went to talk to the manage and they seemed happy to have give us a refund and seemed to have experienced this problem before. Because I had paid through a travel website I called to get the refund the next day and when they spoke to the manager only would issue half saying that’s what we discussed! So I still ended up paying 200 for the worst stay in my life didn’t get to stay for my child’s nap as planned because there was no headboard and I was terrified. Ruined out vacation and wasted our money.< /review><gmap_id>0x80db1ba5967e997b:0x2ea7360171a38fa2</gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If you decide to stay after you get past the gulag staff up front, you'll probably be even further disappointed with the accommodations. Not just old, but smelly. We got a King room with a pool "view". If you use your super-powers of seeing thru columns....could work for you. Oh...asked for a mountain view....haha...no comment. We were stuck in #237.....inside corner unit.  Hotel has no resort feel whatsoever. We used a Groupon method of reserving a $74 room.....ended up being $130 a night including "fees". Oh....the bed!!! King bed was like laying on a sheet of plywood. Tiny single sink bathroom.....whoever or whatever has been reviewing this property as a 3-star hotel is nuts. After day 2 of a 4-day stay we had enough. We skipped out and went back home to Temecula and enjoyed home as never before. If it wasn't for great meals at the likes of Billy Reeds, Lulu's, and LG's, the trip would've been a bigger disappointment. Stay away from Palm Mountain "resort".< /Text>< Pictures>

Both rooms had that "OLD" smell about them. The maintenance staff were very helpful and I felt sorry for them, because clearly the Hotel management don't put any money into maintaing or upgrading rooms.

Parking isn't great, you have to park your car around in the back lane behind the hotel.

The WIFI at this hotel is the worst WIFI connection I have every encountered period. I wouldn't recommend this Hotel to anyone.

This place might have been a Resort & Spa when Sinatra was alive, but not anymore.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have read theses reports and they are not my experience of the hotel. I was last here in February 2014 and had stayed at this resort for a few years. Having had a bereavement in the family I did not stay there last year I intend to comeback towards the end of2016. People over react to being told that there ankle biters are making zoo noises.

The second night we were there we went to dinner at 6:20pm and when we returned at 8:40pm our room had been burglarized.  There are 119 rooms at the hotel and we were the only guest room this happened to.  We were on the third floor overlooking the pool. There was no forced entry and the crooks took my laptop, smartphone, ipod, etc and stole my wife’s purse with her wallet and credit cards. The crooks used the credit cards within minutes of stealing them at gas stations, CVS and RiteAid.
The miserable experience only got worse from there. When I went to the registration desk and told them what had happened they told me to fill out an incident report. I had to berate them into calling the police who didn’t show up until two hours later.  The desk clerk was sympathetic, but took no ownership of the situation. The clerk told me that corporate would get a hold of me. That  was on Thursday night and if I had not followed up no one would have called me. The hotel manager was supposed to call me, but he never has. There was a nice lady named Jodi in accounting who I spoke with, but had no authority. I was finally able to contact someone to speak with from corporate (Pacific Hospitality Group out of San Diego) this Wednesday afternoon, six days later. He was extraordinarily condescending and rude and insinuated I had left my door open and it was my responsibility. He informed me he could do nothing until the police report was turned over to their insurance company and they evaluated the situation.
The corporate executive would take no responsibility for the event and offered no compensation in any form for our loss.  When I asked him why they had no cameras watching the hallways and outside portion of the property he informed me that they are not required to. I saw no security on premises and after 10pm there was only one person on the desk. This hotel is being targeted by professional criminals and I can only conclude that they were either tipped off by housekeeping as to the valuables left in our room or have the technical means to defeat the electronic door locks.
I would not stay at this hotel because I don’t think it is safe (my opinion). I was fortunate that we were not in our room when the burglars entered our room. This hotel is being targeted by professional criminals and I can only conclude that they were either tipped off by housekeeping as to the valuables left in our room or have the technical means to defeat the electronic door locks.  I have stayed in Palm Springs many times and have never had any problems. Just last month we stayed at the Alcazar and had a very enjoyable experience. Nicer grounds and a better pool area. There are many better choices in the Downtown that my wife and I have stated at.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The hotel has a great location. If you cool off in the midday sun in the hotel pool you have a great view of the mountain behind. Overall, the hotel makes a very clean and well-kept impression. The rooms are nicely decorated with a small coffee machine and a big fridge. A free parking space is also available.

(Original)
Das Hotel hat eine super Lage. Wen man in der mittags Sonne sich im Hotel Pool abkühlt  hat man einen grandiosen Ausblick auf den dahinter gelegenen Berg. Insgesamt macht das Hotel einen sehr sauberen und gepflegten Eindruck. Die Zimmer sind nett eingerichtet mit einer kleinen Kaffeemaschine und einem großen Kühlschrank. Ein kostenloser Parkplatz steht auch zur Verfügung.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) 3 stars no more. Many
bugs in our room and on the bed. One fell on his head during the night. Pleasant pool view and good bedding. Too bad for breakfast it's 2 toasted sandwiches. If you want a hearty breakfast you have to pay and discount 3 dollars with hotel coupon

3 étoiles pas plus. Beaucoup
d'insectes dans notre chambre et sur le lit. Un est tombé sur la tête dans la nuit. Vue piscine agréable et literie bonne.  Dommage pour le petit déjeuner c'est 2 tartines grillées.  Si on veut un petit déjeuner copieux il faut payer et remise 3 dollars avec coupon hôtel<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The hotel cannot do anything for the crawling beetles. Plentifully large room ... bathroom sufficient. Spacious terrace and relatively large pool.
Breakfast at Ruby ... Unfortunately not that great, as a tour group we only had 2 dishes to choose from and not even the ones we ordered came. Instead, coffee all you can drink.

(Translated by Google) We are staying at this hotel for the second time. It's quite small, with a great backdrop and is in a great central location. It is a 4 minute walk to N Palm Canyon Drive, the street with most of the restaurants.
The rooms could use a little embellishment, but it still has charm and the staff are all very hard-working. The breakfast offered is served in Ruby's Diner, as the hotel does not have a restaurant itself. Please do not have a room facing the street, operations just start too early.

(Original)
Zum zweiten Mal wohnen wir in diesem Hotel. Es ist recht klein,  mit super Kulisse  und liegt super Zentral. Zu Fuß ist man 4 Minuten im N Palm Canyon Drive, die Strasse mit den meisten Restaurants.
Die Zimmer könnten eine kleine Verschönerung vertragen, trotzdem hat es Charme und die Mitarbeiter sind alle sehr bemüht. Das angebotene Frühstück wird in Rubys Diner serviert,  da dass Hotel selber kein Restaurant hat. Bitte unbedingt kein Zimmer zur Strasse, da geht der Betrieb einfach zu früh los.< /Text>

<Review>I was there with some friends just for 1 night in our way to Coachella, nice location as you have main Palm Springs streets walking distance, clean and spacious rooms. The best part is we arrived almost mid night and they maintained the reservation even tough the check inn was at 3pm - we called when we arrived to LA around 7pm just to make sure and the woman who answered was very nice - Maybe you might have some coffee in the lobby or something ...

Unser Zimmer war sehr groß. Die Möbel und Einrichtung ein wenig abgewohnt. Großer neuer Fernseher und renoviertes Badezimmer. Zimmer mit Balkon und Blick auf den schönen Pool. Neue gute Liegen am Pool. Großer Whirlpool vorhanden. Die Rezeption war super freundlich und effektiv. Spabereich haben wir nicht genutzt. Parkplätze kostenfrei. Nur wenige Meter über einen Parkplatz bis zur Innenstadt.<//Review>

< review>
Erwartet man bei der Ankunft jemanden, der beim Gepäckt hilft, wartet man vergebens. Der etwas korpulente junge Mann, der vor dem Hotel hängt, bewegt sich nur nach Aufforderung. Bringt vielleicht einen Gepäckwagen, ist aber glücklich, wenn man nicht mehr erwartet. Es gibt dort Zimmer, in denen eine unsäglich schlechte Luft vorherrscht. Augen, Nase und Schleimhäute brennen. Man kann die Fenster nicht öffnen. Halbwegs frische Luft ist Mangelware im Zimmer! Läßt man die Zimmertür offen, rennen gaffende Gäste vorbei. Die Hitze, die hereinzieht (es war September mit 40-50 Grad C), macht den Aufenthalt sehr unbequem. An der Hotelrezeption kennt man das Problem und gibt bei Beschwerden auch ein etwas besseres Zimmer. Die Klimaanlagen machen einen ohrenbetäubenden Lärm. Es scheint als ob in und vor den Zimmern Trucks mit laufendem Motor abfahrbereit stehen. Allein sie fahren nicht ab und lärmen die ganze Nacht! Ein sehr lautes und unruhiges Hotel. Kostenlose Parkplätz gibt es genügend ums ganze Gebäude verteilt. Einen Schattenplatz wird man kaum finden. Man tut gut daran, für die Abreise den frühesten Morgen zu nutzen, dann ist die Temperatur im Fahrzeug wegen der Nachtkühle erträglich. Die Bettwäsche lädt nicht gerade zum darin Wohlfühlen ein. Man hat den Eindruck, daß da schon jemand drin geschlafen hat. Das mag täuschen und daran liegen, daß die Bettwäche nicht gebügelt ist. Man muß es selbst ausprobieren.<//review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>(Translated by Google) Nice hotel. Find it really much better than the few pictures, beautiful pool area with jacuzzi, good rooms absolutely nothing negative to say. Only the inclusive breakfast in Ruby's Diner was rather sparse compared to what the diner had on offer (2 slices toast with juice). Otherwise absolutely recommendable, fridge and microwave were very convenient if you want to take care of yourself! About the environment I can not say much, but a supermarket is in the vicinity :-) our group on the road trip liked it (for longer holidays but probably not necessarily perfect for young people)
Incidentally, Internet worked well for us ...

Nur das inklusive Frühstück in Rubys Diner war eher spärlich im Vergleich dazu was das Diner im Angebot gehabt hätte (2 Scheiben toast mit Saft). Ansonsten absolut empfehlenswert, kühlschrank und mikrowelle waren sehr praktisch wenn man sich selbst versorgen mag! Über die Umgebung kann ich nicht viel sagen, aber ein Supermarkt ist in der näheren Umgebung :-) unserer Gruppe auf dem Roadtrip hat's gefallen (für längere Urlaube aber vllt nicht unbedingt perfekt für junge Leute)
