<review>Dishwasher not emptying.  Repair tech came out and diagnosed the problem by checking operation of the pump, checking electrical signals to the pump, and disassembling pump to insure it was not jammed, rather than just assuming it was the pump and installing a new pump.  New pump required (common on GE dishwashers): ordered new pump and installed it the next day.  Cleaned up after all work.  Job well done.< /review>< pictures>

Very responsive and work was done quickly.  Parts arrived late on a Friday and Rufat came back after 6 PM to finish the job.  Very helpful to us, as we then had use of our washer back for the weekend.<//Review>

I called Eli for A/C maintenance. He showed up on time and was able to perform a set of check up of the vents and diagnose the root cause of the problem quickly. He then confirmed the costs with proper documentation and quickly proceeded to fix the issue. My A/C and house is significantly colder now after the fix. Really appreciate his work. He was also professional and easy to work with.< /review>

Great service, prompt and friendly. It is an easy online booking. Eli and his assistant showed up on time and in diagnosing the problem which replace inverter board for our Monogram refrigerator. He told me the cost of the repair; He had that parts as well, so he fixed my refrigerator immediately. Excellent service!  We will certainly be using Spark again and highly recommend them to anyone.</text>

<Text>They are the best in business. I am so glad I got their referral from my friend.
Eli came and diagnosed the problem. He explained two possible reasons to me. Then fixed them.
In short, you cannot find better service than Spark Appliance Repair.< /Text>< Pictures>

Spark Appliance is my new go-to for appliance repair! Great, dependable service, upfront quotes and pricing, professional, and efficient. I also like that I can schedule online! This is my second time using Spark Appliance: first, for a  washer/dryer in need of servicing, and second, for a sagging fridge door with a broken hinge.< /text>

Unfortunately Eli had to pronounce our beloved 5 year old French door bottom freezer refrigerator dead due to compressor failure.  The price for his visit was fair.  He suggested an alternate brand, and we just ordered it from a long time local appliance dealer.  We will definitely call Spark again if needed for any other sick or disabled household appliances.< /Review>

He diagnosed the problem with my washer, explained why it wasn't worth fixing, and recommended some alternatives for finding a new washer. So, not completely wonderful experience (he couldn't fix the washer! Not his fault!) but very professional and quick. Also, the guy showed up exactly on time - that doesn't always happen with service people. I'll definitely call them again when I need appliance work.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Eli came to my house in Santa Clara to fix my ice machine. My housemates and I weren't even really sure what was wrong with it but in under an hour he diagnosed the issue and was able to solve it very quickly. He was extremely efficient and helpful and now the ice machine works again! Eli and his co-worker were very friendly and sweet and even offered to help fix our shower head. My housemates and I would 100% recommend using Spark Appliance Repairs!< /text>

Eli was extremely helpful and professional in replacing my apartment's dishwasher. The new dishwasher required some slight modifications to fit into the space, which were handled deftly, and the trimming around the floor had to be altered, which was above and beyond the call of duty. I would highly recommend Eli and Spark Appliance Repair.< /text>

<Review>Very professional company! I was able to schedule an appointment with them immediately, and technician arrived in an hour, diagnosed the problem in about five minutes, and solved it in another 30 min! I felt he was very honest in explaining issues and provided me a detailed estimate for replacing one unit in the future.  I appreciated that unlike other contractors that have serviced my AC, he did not try to sell me a new unit. Spark is an outstanding and honest company. Would definitely use again!</Review><user>109425694230010566597<//user><Resp>None< /Resp><rate>5< /rate><date>1437633342363< /date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is a wonderful company!!!  Eli is very professional and a pleasure to work with. The company I intern for just moved into a new building and has been having issues, many…many…many issues. So trust me when I say that from dishwasher installation, to random fridge leakage and every problem in between, Eli can fix it! Quick, efficient, and super affordable. Will definitely be using this service again.</Review></record>

Eli was prompt, professional and very helpful. I had called him to see if he could fix my dishwasher which wasn't draining properly. He and an assistant came over the same day and took the time to diagnose the problem correctly. What I really appreciated was his honesty and straight forward approach. My dishwasher was really old and he recommended a replacement instead of trying to fix it. He gave me the estimated pricing for the parts and labor and said it would cost more than getting a new one. He was right. He charged me a nominal fee for his time to diagnose the problem. We spoke for a while before he left and I got to know him a little better. He's a genuinely good guy who wants to do the right thing and not make a quick buck. I highly recommend Eli and Spark Appliance repair!</text>

They were diligent, competent, and reasonably-priced in diagnosing the problem with our old microwave and installing our new one. Despite some unexpected difficulties in the installation process requiring more labor than expected, they honored their original estimate without question.<//Review>

The best experience with appliance company we have ever had. Eli went out of his way to fix our furnace. He couldn’t find the part which was broken in any of the retail or online stores however I it didn’t stop him. I was afraid that we will have to buy and install a new furnace. But Eli promised to fix it and he fixed it, even though it took him 4 visits and probably many hours to find that part. To my surprise it didn’t cost us more and he only charged us the amount he gave in the original estimate.
Very honest Company and professional people.</Text>

EVERY single time I've needed appliance repair, Spark Appliance is my savior. Eli comes out promptly, is efficient, and gives estimates for excellent work. He does NOT upsell or oversell; he's really honest about what you need and what you don't. I truly appreciate that. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.< /text>

<Review>We've used them twice and been very happy both times with promptness, quality of work, politeness, and reasonable pricing.

You can make an appointment online or via phone. I called on a Saturday afternoon, and they had someone come at 9 am on the dot on Sunda.

They repaired our washing machine on-site, and explained what we could do to prevent it from breaking that way again.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Eli rocks! We had an issue with our Electrolux dishwasher and called him in the morning 3 hours later he was at our door and fixed the issue without getting any replacement parts which would have been an expensive repair. He accomplished it for a price well below all other estimates we got. On top of that he is honest and a fair man to do business with. We will call him again in case we have any issues with our appliances.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>We had leaking water in the fridge and our cooling system wasn't working. After I was done panicking I realized that we needed immediately to find a company that will save our fridge and food from spoiling!  It was a repair on short notice and I gave a call to Eli at Spark Appliance for the same day appointment. I was able to make an appointment quickly and Eli arranged a time that was convenient for me. I was very impressed by their promptness, professionalism and fair pricing. Spark Appliance is the company caring about the customer and we are so lucky to have them in our area.
I will definitely use Spark Appliance again and  recommending Eli to everyone.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808fb7d436ac2251:0xf7f64ed897f2985d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We got a problem with our "aging" Maytag washer dryer  and called Spark Appliance right away.The technician Eli picked up the call asked the right questions about the problem. The next day he came , diagnosed the problem and fixed our Maytag washer dryer stack unit. The cost was in my budget and Eli saved me money and time. My experience with the company was excellent, and the Spark Appliance is the best appliance repair place I have ever done business with! Terrific customer service and  I will be using them in the very near futur<//review>

If you want to do a favor to yourself, your family and friends, call the "Spark Appliance Repairs" for your HVAC services. Eli ' the owner' is Reliable, Friendly. Excellent price, and on time.  He even patiently helped me with other Electrical issues not related to Heating system in our house with no extra charges.</Review>

I found this company on Yelp and wasn't disappointed.  They offer online scheduling (useful at 11 at night,) and were able to come in the very next day.  They worked quickly to diagnose the problem and quote me a price, and then left to go get the necessary part.  Within the hour, they were back, and now my washer is as good as new.  Elsevar (Eli) was friendly and professional, and he and his assistant were courteous, thoughtful and left the garage looking like no one had even been there.  He showed me the broken part and explained what was wrong, and then offered a 6-month warranty on the part and the work.

I wholeheartedly recommend Spark Appliance.  Thank you for all your help!<//Review>

<Time>1549930694943< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>The oven of my 13 year-old Kenmore dual fuel range stopped working a little while ago.  We scheduled an appointment with Spark Appliance Repair online which was extremely convenient and the interface was very user-friendly.  Elshan was on time, courteous and most importantly knowledgeable.  He was able to diagnose the problem very quickly, the only caveat was that the malfunctioned part is no longer being manufactured.   Fortunately Elshan recalled another customer was able to have the part repair by a third party and he googled the third party information for me.   With the oven control board out, I could still operate the gas range by igniting the burners with matches but Elshan did some extra work so that I could still ignite the burners without using matches.
The part was remanufactured and Elshan just reinstalled it for us.  The oven is working again!  The service was efficient and Elshan took time to explain to me what's a normal fan sound, etc..  Definitely recommend Spark Appliance Repair for top notch service and job well done!< /Review>< pics>

Eli and his assistant showed up and fixed our Monogram refrigerator that had been making sounds for weeks like a jet engine and having huge fluctuations in temperature.  Eli correctly diagnosed the evaporator fan as the problem, took it apart, put it back together and voila, problem solved.  No more jet engine in the kitchen and steady temp in the refrigerator and freezer, all at a cost that is a fraction of the "authorized" repair guys.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Same-day, on-time service, very professional, I will use them for all future appliance repairs.  Eli diagnosed problem with dishwasher (burned out circuit board), and explained cause.  He wrote up itemized repair cost, showed me the parts cost (googled info on the spot), and discussed the options.  Although it meant no further work for him, Eli recommended replacing rather than repairing the dishwasher, given its age and the repair cost - which made perfect sense.  He was very straight about everything.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808fb7d436ac2251:0xf7f64ed897f2985d< /gmapID></record>

<review>The guys came out on a Saturday - they were able to replace a leaking hose on the dishwasher. But the older washer needed a timer to be replaced.

He would find out the cost on Monday. I had to call him later in the week - but he called right back and was able to come out on Friday to put in the part.

They were careful to not scratch our new floors when pulling out the appliances - and told us up front the costs.

I don't know where $155 for a visit fits with other places - but that plus costs, did not seem unreasonable, and I felt that they were doing a careful job and double checking that everything was working before they left!

Would call them next time I need an in-home appliance repair. Very polite and friendly!<//review><name>Ms_Gary< /name>< userid>

I got problem with my Kenmore range and needed a professional and experienced appliance repair company. I found Spark Appliance Repair on Yelp and the reviews seemed too good. So, I decided to contact them explained the symptoms over the phone and Eli told that it maybe control board  problem but he needs to see the range. He made the same day appointment and even provided a courtesy call when was on his way. He quickly detected what was wrong with my oven (yes ,it was control board which  needed to be replaced) and quoted me the price.He offered me an appointment for the next day to come back with parts and complete the repair.The next day Eli did an amazing repair job and fixed my problem . He  also took extra care in protecting the floor . Furthermore, 2 days later Eli called to see if the was working "ok"! Spark Appliance Repair is cost conscious , quick, efficient and I will be going back to this company if another appliance needs repair! Highly recommended</Review>

< Review>
I live in an apartment on the boarder of East Palo Alto & Menlo Park.  I had a problem with my refrigerator and freezer.  So, the manager of my apartment complex called in Elsevar of SPARK APPLIANCE REPAIR and one of his workers to fix it.  They did an EXCELLENT JOB!!!  Elsevar explained everything he did so I would understand what was going on.  He and his worker were so PROFESSIONAL, POLITE AND CLEAN.  Just really nice people that you feel comfortable having in your home.  The apartment managers where I live use this company for ALL appliance repairs.  I couldn't ask for better service and nicer people.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY.<//Review>

My split system was down for no reason.  I called spark and made an appointment next day.  They did all diagnostic for $55, and spent 2 extra hours to open the case to be sure the problem is occurred on compressor, without any charge.  They are now finding parts for me.  Very professional!<//Review>

<text>The three of us had a very positive experience at this welcoming coffee shop. We all ordered cappuccino, in two variations, amd although the "dry" one wasn't perfect, the taste, temperature and firmness of foam were up to expectations. On a plus side, they use whole milk by default. We also had bagels, which were toasted to perfection  and served with generous portions of cream cheese or jam. Both the cashier who took our orders and the barista were patient, professional, and personable. A pleasant quick stop for our breakfast, would come back again if in the area.< /text>< pictures>

Definitely worth an easy stop off the 101, when you have a crave for coffee. It is a local shop. If you see the car dealers, you went too far.  It is easy to miss in this small strip mall. The coffee itself is good.
If you miss this, there is the pricey whole foods down the way, if
you want a quick meal...also near the 101.< /Text>

Usually, this is my go to place. ItsI right by our office. I walked in this morning to order a box of coffee, their staff looked at me like I was crazy and told me that they needed 24 hours notice to BREW COFFEE. Walked out and staight into coastal peaks, they said no problem, got brewing and had me out the door in 10 minutes. Anyone getting a larger quantity of coffee for a meeting....I recommend staying away from black horse.</review>

Good coffee, but...
They were low on everything else.
Only one person was working in the place. While there was no crowd I still had to wait 10 minutes to get my drink after ordering.</text>

The male manager (taller asain man) I can't remeber his name, is always very nice and engaging. When I was there he calmly dealt with a customer infront of me who was upset that one of the female baristas messed up a drink. I think the barista was new, and seemed flustered, and he quickly corrected her mistake. I was impressed to see how he handled the situation and the other customer left happy.<//Text>

My partner and I have been ordering from Pizza hut for years. We always try to get wings when we can afford it since we love them so much. You used to give 2 sauces per order of wings so when I came home with one blue cheese and one ranch my SO thought I had gotten one of each for free. It caused a fight. Your being cheap about your sauces started a fight. You make billions, put 2 sauce packets in the wing orders man.< /text>

<text>I order weekly from this location because all the staff are so friendly.  They go above and beyond to accommodate my son who has autism.  They would substitute a drink in place of garlic bread because he does not eat garlic bread with his pasta.  I alway recommend this location to all my friends and neighbors.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

The pizza crust was too dry.  The large pizza itself, although the toppings were good, was not in any way worth the 19$ we paid, for a meal for three people.  Dominos is a far better value.  In addition, by the time we paid for tip $6, california fee $3, tax $4-5, and delivery fee we were over 56$ for to large pizzas! I can order out Chinese take-out for $23 and have enough for more than 2 meals for 3 adults.<//text>

This location usually gives us great food.  However tonight we ordered a large pepperoni pizza with extra sauce and 6 piece traditional wings mild. Our pizza had no extra sauce barely any sauce and they gave us bone out breaded wings in I believe hot sauce . I always get mild and this one tasted hotter.  Not sure why our order was messed up to this extent but I hope they get back to doing things great as before.< /Review>

He is the manager of Pizza Hut but he is very dirty. After he picked his nose, he went to talked to a co-worker and picked up pizza. Never even washed his hands!< /Review>< Rating>

Rating for counter service take out only. Standard Pizza Hut menu and WingStreet chicken wings prepared consistently as ordered.  An extra "Service fee" is tacked on to your order price so the advertised prices are NOT the full price before tax. This is deceptive but once you are aware of it you can decide if their prices are a good deal. Use Web ordering for discounts. Parking at this location, either in shopping center parking lot or on street, can be difficult at busy times. No seating except at a few tables outside for your carry out order.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Today was closing at one o'clock in the morning, and I arrived at twelve o'clock, but the door was locked and no entry was allowed. The two staff members chatted in the back kitchen for a long time, and I knocked on the glass door for a long time. The pair of Mexican staff members just kept chatting and could not open the door. I turned a blind eye to me for at least ten minutes. This feeling is very bad! Very rude!

(Original)
今天是凌晨一点打烊，我十二点到达，大门却锁着，不让进。两名工作人员在后厨聊天聊了很久，我敲了很久的玻璃门，这对墨西哥工作人员只顾着聊天不开门。至少有十分钟对我视而不见。这种感受很不好！很没有礼貌！< /review>

Every time i visit this location they are super friendly and always recommend sampling when you can't quite pick which flavor is your favorite. Best place in Long Beach for frozen yogurt (both dairy and non dairy options)</Text>

<text>Stood in line for 45 minutes... Well worth the wait. Delicious ice cream! I got the red velvet  ice cream in a waffle cone! Yum! My boyfriend got coffee toffee! We had a great time! The baked goods looked amazing!</text><time>1536413776566< /time></record></dataset><record>
<Review>For one, it's open late enough - until 11 p.m. - which is more than many places in Long Beach can say. There was no line at about 10:15 on Saturday night. The counter associate greeted me, smiled, and was helpful, as it was my first time there and I didn't know what I was doing. The frozen yogurt and toppings were delicious and the price... well, worth it!< /Review><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dd3139bd34a7a3:0x89cca6af549b95bd<//GmapID>< Name>

< Review>
Celebrated a very special milestone birthday of my partner's at this marvelous establishment, which honestly made the event that much better. Happy to have had been both recommended and invited to dine here by family who had raved about it. And for all the accolades given, Perle was not undersold in its excellence in attention to cuisine and wines.

Just East enough away from the bustle of San Francisco, and shy, below the beautiful wine valleys of California, Perle Wine Bar is nestled cozily on a quiet posh street in Oakland.

We dined one Thursday evening on the 25th of March 2021 to an a la-carte array befitting a tasting menu of much from what Perle has to offer.

Bravo to the chef and kitchen as well as to the front of house and service staff for such a marvelous meal and such a wonderful experience which will keep our memories of our little celebration reminiscing your restaurant in equal favour.< /Review>

Well worth finding this place. Not huge but cozy and especially enjoyed the ambiance created by the management team of Marcus and Rob -- who were present and charming. We enjoyed the chicken and the steak dinners (generous portions, so we took some home for another meal, yummy!). Good wine, beer, cocktail list, and all reasonably priced. High ceilings keep the noise to a manageable level. Parking available on the street, or try the nearby Safeway lot.</Text>

two days ago was our first time we went to this restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We had a good time with the generous service, with the exceptional cooking and fine drinks and with the comfortable price. We will absolutely visit there again.< /text>

Splurged on Perle for my Birthday tonight. I never imagined it could be so good! I’ve assumed that fine cuisine wouldn’t survive pandemic takeout. Surprised to find it to be the most memorable birthday dinner I’ve had. We ordered the filet mignon -  beautiful prepared and packaged to preserve the integrity of the ingredients. Wild mushrooms, seared duck liver, tender filet mignon came with a fresh arugula salad and a crisp and perfect créme brûlée dessert. So many layers of flavors and bright notes! My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Thank you, Perle!< /review>

Came here for Prime Rib Mondays with three of my good friends. It was our first time here, and needless to say we'll be back. The restaurant atmosphere is cozy and elegant, the service was attentive and friendly, and the food was delicious. Didn't manage to get pictures of the prime rib or salmon main course, but pictured are two first course options (mushroom soup and avocado toast), and the dessert course: pumpkin pie with berry compote. 😋<//review>

Their servers don't know the wine, can't even describe the wine, and definitely recommends the wrong wine. They aren't properly trained for an establishment like this, and it pains me because I'd love to come back here more often.</review>

Great restaurant and addition to Montclair. Feels like a really nice neighborhood restaurant in a great way. Nice inside but not stuffy at all. The food we had was inventive and very good. Well thought out wines by the glass that represent a good price spread across several good regions.< /Text>

Had a fantastic Birthday dinner for my husband at Sotto Mare. We were lucky to get a larger table for additional family members to join the celebration. We ordered the halibut, sanddabs, sautéed prawns, seafood Cioppino, oysters, scallops. Best Italian Seafood restaurant and reasonably priced! Excellent service!</Review>

<review>Very interesting and imaginative food.  All of the appetizers were great, especially the oysters with caviar, uni, and salmon roe and the bone marrow and beef tartar.  For the entrees, we had the pork chop was also delicious and perfectly cooked and the Wagyu beef.

Great place for just drinks or a full meal.  Not a huge dining room so I would highly recommend reservations for paid larger than 6.  We will definitely come back soon.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1561328085623, 'text': 'Thank you and we hope to see you again'}</resp><GmapID>0x808f879aaf0736d9:0x83c4e2a7e56b0ea1<//GmapID></record>

Great wine selection including a good by the glass champagne selection. The food and service surprisingly good at this price point. Just goes to show, good customer service orientation shouldn't cost more. It's a matter of creating a culture, hiring the right people and training them.</text>

< Review>
Last night was so special. We started with the Montclair Manhattan, so smooth and complex aromatics. This bistro bar concocts excellent, original cocktails by Rob at the helm. Then the board of charcuterie arrived with Mimolette, Chèvre, NDujia and Saussicon Sec, fresh bread, and many clever accoutrements including a pickled Julienne carrot melange. The mushroom pasta ragout and citrus salad were divine and followed by appropriate pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon and sumptuous Beaujolais. Portions are generous and grounds for a gourmet lunch the following day. A 10-year Sandeman port capped off the perfect evening to celebrate a colleagues’ new job in with Arthur Anderson in San Francsico. 10/10<//Review>

<rate>4<//rate><text>Beautiful little Sunday brunch here at this French bistro. It's tucked away in the Montclair neighborhood with a great local vibe. The unique starter of deviled eggs topped with a fresh fried oyster and a little bit of roe was amazing. The chicken and waffle was a distinctly French take with a small, plump sweet waffle and two tender pieces of bird. Frittatas and salad were amazing. So was the bread, as it should be at any bistro. I hear dinner is even better. Would love to try it.< /text>< Pictures>

Tartare (coupé au couteau pour les français ) with truffled caviar on top? What?!  I have no words. Just amazing.
Impeccable service to top it off. Oh and out-of-this-world oysters! Such an experience. Thank you!</text>

<Review>My family has lived in Montclair for decades.  Now, we are blessed to have one of our favorite restaurants just a few minutes from home.  Perle provides fine dining quality food and style for an affordable price (entrees are around $30).

Chef Rob has a remarkable passion for food, which is evident in every bite you take and on full display with Perle's open kitchen.  Meanwhile, Chef Rob's co-owner, Marcus, runs the front of the house and serves as the sommelier.  His professionalism and hospitality match any fine dining establishment, but he has that unique ability to sincerely and genuinely treat every guest like family.

Go for the food because it is precise and deliberate.  Stay for the people because Rob and Marcus are great at what they do in the restaurant, but also the type of people you want as your neighbors, friends, and family!

ALL-STAR PEOPLE: Chef Rob and Marcus.< /Review>< user>

Newbies in the neighborhood and just happened upon this place and it was a great experience.

We were headed for sushi next door but got rejected because we didn't have a reservation even though they had 6 empty tables.

Lucky for us!

Alex was at the door at Perle and was strait forward about our chances, but didn't rule out getting in for dinner. We killed some time and when we returned he went out of his way to shoehorn us in at the counter.

The place has that great classic bistro feel.. like you could be in any metropolitan city in the world.  Our stoolmates we're friendly and entertaining, the bartender was attentive and made us feel like we were dining with family.

Now the food....  Well for us it was fantastic! We're recent transplants from SF and we've dined in all sorts of restaurants all over the world and this place is at the top of our list.

We had a great bottle of pino recommended by their sommelier, the oysters with Thai dipping sauce, beef tartar with bone marrow and trout roe, and the biggest muscles I ever seen with spicey meatballs. What a great combination!

Every dish was plate licking good!

Highly recommend this place for a friendly & casual dining experience. You won't want to leave....</Review>

Yes! This is a wonderful addition to Montclair, and much needed. Loved the muscles, salad and delicious cocktails. The reason for 4 stars instead of 6 - the owner asked the couple next to us, who were still enjoying their drinks, to leave, as he had a "reservation " waiting. The couple taken by surprise got up with drink in hand and left. Yes, they had paid their bill.. but there is no excuse for this behavior.</Text>

Everything we ate had that little extra ingredient, or textural note, to push it over the top to something special.  From the smoked salmon toasts & pear & endive salad, to the bavette steak & linguini alle vongole, all the way to the hot chocolate pot de creme which was, as Brian promised, "to die for."

Amazing food and cocktails! Wish they offered a few kid-friendly options but also like the fact that I could go there and kids wouldn't be around ;-)<//review>

This new place looks great. It was crowded and VERY loud on a Friday night. Clientele much more Montclair than Oakland.

Menu is very edited, bistro-ish focused on oysters and caviar. Normally I am fine with a short menu but this was pretty repetitive so the choices were very limited. Prices are high. Good wine list with probably more than 15 wines by the glass.

Service was a little awkward, and we waited over 20' after our first course was cleared to get the second course.

Food was hit and miss. Green salad, well you don't expect too much, but most good places will do something interesting. This was pretty much just leaves on a plate, and the dressing was unevenly applied and all the pepper came in one bite. Mushroom soup was OK if very small-maybe 3 ounces? Oysters ironically were the low point; not delicious and too many things on top. Beef tartare with truffles and caviar was good.</review>

<rating>4</rating><Review>They should really rebrand themselves and not include "fine wine and cocktails." the food here is AMAZING. the beef tartare with bone marrow. oysters with uni OMG incredible. oyster shooters had complexity and were delish. the only thing i didn't like was their seafood entree, and we only chose that because they took off our regular from the menu (the steak with foie gras - OUT OF THIS WORLD). Drinks were OK. Dessert was wonderful - presentation, taste, temperature.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

We went for Sunday Brunch with family and friends this afternoon and had a fantastic time! The menu is great... The decor is beautiful. The wine list is to.die.for. It's a well stocked, no joke wine list, at really fair prices. And we had some excellent cocktails. Is describe the fare as French with an American/California flair. Everything is very well thought out and cohesive.

We had Bloody Marys (yum); the cheese platter (double yum);  the mushroom cappuccino soup, which was warm and lovely, smelled as incredible as it tasted, and was presented beautifully; the eggs Benedict was divine - the best I've had in a very long time, with nice, crisp ham and perfect hollandaise; the avocado and smoked salmon toasts were light and beautiful and super tasty; and the burger was RIDICULOUSLY delicious, served with melty cheese and carmelized onions and a jus for dipping. My daughter ordered it, but I ended up eating about half of it because it was just that good.

The service was fast and friendly, and the ambience was comfortable and welcoming. Just thinking about the food is making me hungry! We'll definitely be going back to Perle for dinner, and putting it in our regular restaurant rotation.<//review>

<review>Great food, easily
the best in the East Bay, plus great wine and excellent sommeliers to help pair each course with wine. Also, it has rare craft and Belfian beers on tap.</review>< Time>

<user>103209295353049932544<//user><text>We came during their soft opening on their first Saturday night. The restaurant filled up but the entire staff was professional and attentive, and so fun! We had the oysters supreme with foie gras, caviar, uni and black truffle, the avocado salad with stone fruit, the chicken roulade, the cauliflower, and the rum cake for dessert. The food was amazing, and the beverage program was even better! Go here. Srsly. Come to the neighborhood just for this.< /text><rating>5</rating></record>

This place is very professional, knowledgeable, and very precise in their work. The tint itself truly reduces the heat that makes it's way into the vehicle, it also reduces the glare of lights especially when driving. It also looks very cool 😎.< /review>

Best window tint service in town ( and I’ve used quite a few). They respond quickly to texts, very informative about the services and brands they use in house. Great warranty and high grade tint. I purchased the i3 ceramic tint for my vehicle and it came out outstanding. Stays very temperate in my vehicle in this hot fresno weather. Upon the tint drying, there are no visible bubbles and or film peeling from corners. They work on a lot of high end vehicles and no car is a challenge. Highly recommend and look forward to using them again.< /text>

Now I am safer from the sun rays and the leather in my new car is protected as well.. The inside is so much cooler after being locked up in the sunlight.  I really liked that these guys took time to demonstrate the differences in the choices I was able to make.< /text>

Just got my girlfriends 2018 Nissan Altima tinted there earlier, and I must say, they are 5 stars all around! Great customer service, and they were very thorough in explaining to me the different benefits of the tints they offer.

I called yesterday morning for an appointment, and I was booked the very next morning. Car looks great now, I highly recommend! 5 stars all around!</review>

<review>You get what you pay for. Service was great, car looks amazing, very professional and informative. Freddy and the crew did a phenomenal job on my Scion tC. I went in, not knowing how tints work or the variety of tints they had available and they helped me get a better understanding of how they work and choosing a tint that I wanted. First time getting a vehicle tinted and I’m glad it was with these guys. Definitely plan on taking future cars with them. Shout out to Freddy, Daniel, Carlos, and the rest of the crew that worked on my car, it’s much appreciated.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I called on Memorial Weekend (Saturday) and they got me in Sunday!  4 hours later and my car is PERFECT, and that’s saying a LOT cause I am a very particular car person.  Their i3 tint is amazing.  Will be doing my other car shortly!  5 stars+<//text>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>From the time I called and scheduled, to the moment the installer left, Cen Cal Mobile Tinting was friendly and professional. Daniel was early to my appointment, which was not a problem for me. He was incredibly friendly, yet professional, and knowledgable. He taught me a couple things about his job and the process, so I could have a better understanding. It makes a huge difference in customer service when you're dealing with someone who is smiling and able to have a casual conversation. I treat my car like a baby, so I was appreciative of how Daniel was gentle, clean, and accurate as he worked. I had my two front windows tinted with the ceramic 5%, and I love how it looks and feels on the outside and inside. I will definitely use this company whenever I need tinting in the future!<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>I was super impressed with how quick and professional everyone was. I was able to make an appointment within a week. When I dropped the car off, I figured it would take most of the day - I was thrilled to get a call a few hours later that it was done and ready to be picked up!
The quality is well worth the price. I could have paid less somewhere else, but I doubt there would have been the attention to detail and I know I wouldn’t have gotten the high quality product that was installed.
I will definitely be recommending them to anyone that asks!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmap_id>0x80945b5b16a384cd:0xb196c0df80e46f70<//gmap_id>< Time>

Fantastic work and great customer service. I must say I had the hardest time finding Cen Cal. But once I did it was the best decision I made because I called 8 different window tinting places and they were all about the money and how high they can go. Cen Cal gives you the lowest prices and allows you to chose any service you'd like when you get there. I was done ✔within an hour!
I know remarkable right?
They guarantee their work 💪so I'm extremely happy! Nice Job!!!😉< /text>

Daniel is super friendly and I couldn’t have asked for better service. We’ve had 2 cars done by them and are planning on getting a 3rd done. Definitely recommend using CenCal Tinting!< /review>

I was very pleased with Daniel and Hector. I needed a tint removal and wanted to apply a ceramic tint. Daniel answered all of my questions and got me scheduled the very next day.  Hector and Daniel were very professional and are highly recommended by me. I could not be happier with the tint. I did appreciate that they take pride in their work at this business and offer a life time warranty. The quality of the tint they put on my new 2021 Nissan Rogue Plantinum is excellent.<//text>

Very professional, great customer service, overall good experience. Still a little early to comment on the quality because I have to wait 2 weeks to see if some small air bubbles on 1 window dissappear.  But I'm pretty confident if they don't that Daniel and the guys will take care of it.  Love the way my Titan looks now. Should have done it a long time ago. My wife's Flex is next.<//text>

This was my first time getting a tint so he was very helpful with explaining everything. The tint itself looks amazing. They took their time to make sure everything came out perfect.

<Review>I recently purchased a 2021 Kia Forte at Future Kia of Clovis and They highly recommended Cen Cal Tinting. I saw them on Facebook and decided to give them a call. After speaking with Daniel to get information and a quote. I scheduled my appointment for Saturday morning. I got lost finding the place but they were so helpful on the phone to get me there. I was not sure what kind of tint to get. I was shown the different tints and levels of darkness by James who was so helpful and he made my decision so easy. I trusted them after meeting them and I knew the car was in good hands. They called me when the car was ready to pick-up and I love how it turned out!!! They are the best place to get your car windows tinted!!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Daniel and James are window tinting masters. They were on time and were very knowledgeable and thorough on what type of film to suggest and quality of work. Not to mention they left my car clean after completing the work. I’m very satisfied with the work and now I know why they come highly recommended. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for window tint work. Thanks again Central Cal Tint.< /text>

I brought my 2020 Honda here a few months ago on a weekend for ceramic tint when they were at the old shop and they did a pretty good job and a few weeks ago i brought my girlfriends 2021 Honda to their new shop on Fine st on a weekend but now they have a new employee working their and he helped me choose the tint and also tinted the vehicle and his work is the best. I love this place for window tinting.</Text>

Extremely happy with CenCal tinting! They took their time answering questions when I requested a quote, set up an appointment to fit my busy schedule and even sent me a reminder text. On the day of tinting I dropped it off and it was finished way faster then I expected with great quality too! Highly recommend them<//text>

I found them on the web and liked that they had good reviews. Asked for a quote and got a text the next day regrading it. I loved that they texted me instead of calling since i don't answer numbers i don't know. The texts were friendly and professional, bonus, there was no pressure to get my windows tinted by them. The place was a little hard to find but other then that, everything was great. It did end up costing me more then quoted but that's only cuz after talking to Fred(i think that's his name), i decided to go with some higher quality tinting to fit my needs better(keep heat out, make it so i can't be seen as much and keep out headlights/outside light). When i picked up my car i was floored. It looks so good, they did an amazing job. I would do recommend them.< /Text>

I'm glad that they have the service option to come to your  garage to get the tinting done so we didn't have to go there and wait.

THE BEST IN FRESNO AREA!!!! Daniel with Cencal tinted the windows for our sons car in January of 2020. He was professional and had great customer service. Daniel arrived on time, was fast and even took off the old tint that we weren't aware was still on the vehicle. Highly recommend Daniel to anyone looking for a great tint job at a reasonable price and with great customer service! Give Daniel a call, he will not dissapoint!</review>

<date>1615234070277< /date><Review>Daniel was very professional. As I was looking for a local tint place, I called one and it proceeded me to a voicemail, in which I left. I never received a call back from Darkside. The next day I saw Cen Cal ad on top of the google list and reached out. I immediately received a text indicating they were on the other line and he would call me back. Daniel from Cen Cal called back in less than 5 minutes willing to take my car in or schedule a home visit on Sunday or Monday morning at  7AM. I took the advantage of them coming to my home and throughout the week, they text me reminders of my appointment. Daniel and the other installer was on time at 7am. They did the install in less than 2 hours and left me with some great information, along with my warranty. I look forward to them installing tint on my 4runner as well.

Very friendly and professional. They were done with an appointment before mine so I was able to get my car done much earlier. Product looks great! I definitely recommend them if anyone is looking to get their windows tinted. They are a mobile service so I didn’t have to waiting in a shop waiting room or drop off my car. After shopping around a bit, their prices were competitive from others and product is backed with lifetime warranty.</review>

<text>Just bought a new car yesterday and called them to get tint completed on our Mazda CX-5. We got a next day appointment and they even came to pick up the car and bring it back due to us not having a big enough garage. Also, very knowledgeable on the phone which is always a plus on trying a new place! Great prices and the results are fantastic! We would highly recommend!</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80945b5b16a384cd:0xb196c0df80e46f70< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Daniel made it easy to schedule an appointment. The day of the appointment he kept me updated on his arrival. I was even given a 6 minute eta which made it perfect since I was napping with a newborn. Daniel was friendly and easy to talk to and answered any questions I had. Definitely will use this service again. A buddy of mine recommended him and I do as well.<//text>

<Text>Overall, excellent customer service with outstanding professionalism! Still a bit too early to say about the quality, but from what I am seeing on my wife's car that I took in today (Saturday, May 22, 2021), it is looking great thus far, so I'm sure quality is superb! Nonetheless, from my experience, I can say for sure my wife and I are fully satisfied and happy! Job well done to CenCal, the team,and Freddy and Daniel, you guys are the Real MVP! Freddy and Daniel provided excellent customer service with outstanding professionalism! Now that's how you win your customers and have them coming back! Greatly knowledgable and friendly; did not come off as rude and took their time to explain the different tints they offer and what their differences are. Recently, I have been looking around for windows tint for my wife's Toyota Corolla car.  The places (rated with high ratings) I contacted via phone were rude and came off as unprofessional/unfriendly. I then came across CenCal and I have to say, Daniel's punctual professionalism and friendly customer service via  phone was what won me over. Dropped by to check out their different tints, and the CenCal team and Freddy greeted me right away. Freddy provided exceptional customer service and took his time to explain the tints they offered, how they work, and also answered any questions I had, so thats definitely an A+ in my book! They were very accommodating and was able to squeeze in my car for that day even though they were busy booked; got it done on the same day! Highly recommend them! I will let friends and family know of your business. For sure I will definitely come back for any future windows tint installations! Thanks CenCal Window Tinting, team, and Daniel and Freddy! Keep up the excellent work!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1622050824701, 'text': 'Thank you for the review! It was an honor to work on your wife’s car.

<review>Daniel and James were on time, friendly, and very professional! I got the Ceramic tint on the back, front, and sun roof window to help block out the heat. I loved that they take great pride in their work and it shows! They are also reasonably priced. I absolutely LOVE my tint and plan on having them tint our truck in the near future! I’d highly recommend them and would refer to all my family and friends!
I will update my review next summer to let you all know how they guarded against our Fresno, CA heat. I’m sure they’ll do great!</review>< Pictures>

Daniel did an excellent job! He quoted us a price that was better than many of the competitors while offering the service done at our own home. He was helpful and professional. The finished product came out impeccable. I highly recommend this company. We'll be sure to contact Daniel again for future tints.< /review>

These guys were amazing, affordable, fast, and professional! I got an appt really fast and I dropped my car off soon I don't have a garage and he dropped me off at home until my car was ready and dropped my car back off to me! I needed my back 2 windows to have the old bubbly tint removed and put new tint on. They were done within an hour and it came out amazing! I highly recommend these guys and will be referring them to people that need their tint done. Thanks again! You guys were awesome!<//Text>

Daniel did an awesome job on my 2020 Chevy Silverado. He was professional and was willing to answer all my questions about what type of tint I should go with. The convenience of the company coming to your home was a huge benefit. Especially for anyone with kids. I didn’t have to sit in a waiting room or have to make time to pick up my vehicle after completion. I would highly recommend this company.< /Review>

They were on time, professional, and the tint looks perfect. If you're looking for a mobile tint service this is the one to go with.

<time>1614313104538</time><text>I recently purchased a new vehicle and reached out to CenCal for tinting the front windows so that it would match the factory tint on the rear windows. Daniel quickly responded and had an opening the next morning. He gave me a very reasonable price. The very next morning I dropped off the car and also added tinting the windshield with a clear (blue) tint to reflect the heat and within a few hours the car was done. When I stopped by to pick it up they were just putting the finishing touches on and cleaned the vehicle so it was exactly as I left it. All in all, the service was top notch, Daniel was responsive, knowledgeable, and on time and delivered as promised. CenCal is exactly what a small local business should be - quality work, good service, and dedicated to the craft.

I wouldn’t hesitate to go back to CenCal for my next tint job.< /text><name>Ricky Caperton<//name>< resp>

<text>Very professional, they came  to my home and performed a very good job on my vehicle . Very professional and also couldn’t even tell they were here  (meaning they cleaned up after themselves) I have always went to one other place for my window tint  but this experience has changed my mind and it’s a huge appreciation/convenience for them to come to my home and tint my windows .

Won't do semi trucks because they are to lazy to cut the tint, or just don't have the skills,  so basically they rely on a machine,<//Review>

Had a wonderful experience with cencal tint the best hands down in Fresno. Daniel has the best customer service and does phenomenal work. Easy to make an appointment with and fix any problems that may come along. I had to cancel due to work and he understood and booked me for the next weekend with conformation text hassle free! As soon I brought my car home my neighbor wanted to know where I got the work done and said only the best and gave him Daniel business card. I would highly recommend to family and friends!</review>

NOT ANY MORE This business comes to your house and is fully self-contained They installed ceramic window tint on our Kia sport age to help us protect the kids from the sun and as a bonus we got some added privacy which is great! The quality of work is amazing we are super happy with the results and as a family we would recommend this to anyone who is on the fence about the investment!</review></record>

We’re sorry to hear our prices weren’t for you, however many of our customers come from other local tint shops and actually compliment us on how great our prices are compared to other shops while still offering a much more convenient mobile service! We focus on offering our customers the best and easiest experience while only carrying the best window film that is known to last! Our prices have remained the same throughout the year and we encourage you to price match some more as more shops open so you can see our prices are in line with the industry standard.

Daniel tinted my whole car (Chevy Cruze). It has now been about 4 months since the tint and it’s in perfect condition. I also got the sun strip, which I highly recommend to anyone like myself who is too short to benefit from the car sun visor! Daniel will come to you and is very prompt and friendly. I recommend everyone to cen cal tinting!<//text>

<Text>I found the only thing was good was the steak. It was cooked to my liking.The fries were just okay. Service was very good and the salad was boring. You wouldn’t know this is a restaurant as it’s a place where they auction cattle. Only knew about it from others.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>One of the best places for Bask food.... YES i said Bask food! On Friday nights they serve some of the best Bask food I have ever had!  The garlic chicken was super tender, juicy and had lots of garlic! The steaks they offer are also very fresh, tender and juicy! You must give it a try. It is a very small place so i would suggest you make reservations. I promise that you will not be disappointed in the food or the service.< /Text><Name>Efrain Garza<//Name><date>1576130192127<//date><response>None< /response>< pictures>

Absolutely lovely! Lovely take on hash browns, which were “deconstructed”. Bacon was perfectly crispy. Toast was toasted well. Eggs a little over cooked. Service was magnifique- offered a coffee top up multiple times. Wonderful establishment. 4/5 to you!</text>

Amazing food, I have never been disappointed. Be sure to try a steak and the rack of lamb is out of this world. Top notch service huge portions. *pro tip they can be a little slow so call your order in ahead of time if you are in a hurry.</Text>

Perfect for dates. Every Friday night is Basque style. May come off as expensive, but it's well worth the price.< /Text>

I have tried almost everything on the menu and have come for the basque Friday night dinner. And it is all fantastic. Go ahead and try it for youself.

I recommend that you try the lunch  one day. And dome back Friday night for the basque night that has diffrent food choices.  ( if you are planning on going Friday I highly recommend making a reservation.  )</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Food was great.  Had the ribeye breakfast.  Country potatoes,  scrambled eggs, huge ribeye, and biscuit with sausage and bacon gravy.  Idle Spur is south of McFarland on highway 99 and hwy 46 west to Wasco.  Friday's is Basque night.</Review>

If your looking for a Great steak look no further Idle Spur has the best tasting steaks anywhere near Kern County.< /Review>

<Name>Boss in a Skirt<//Name><text>My sister took me here for a much needed pedicure. We didn't have an appointment, we walked in and had to wait of course. But checking in at the door our temps were checked and was sent straight to the sink to wash! 😍🥰🥰🥰 I was politely greeted by Linda (my technician) with hand sanitizer! We all took shot of sanitizer! Lol. Let me tell you, baby went to work with so much love... I don't know about you but I ain't neva had a *local* nail shop rub my toes & feet down with lemon! 🙌🏾 I had a pedicure, gel polish, with callus remover, a gentle oil massage with a warm steamed towel to wrap it up 😌 They only accept cash and I don't think anyone mentioned that to us. They had a ATM on site that charges $1. In total I paid $39 They were very clean, following Covid Restrictions, had a good atmosphere WITH MUSIC... Linda reminded me "SPA"! Lol!</text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Unfortunately my experience here was not as great as i would've hoped. I got myself acrylics and they're were many things that i didn't personally like. First things first i asked for coffin shaped nails, and they gave me a shape that was very different from what i had asked. Secondly, while they were doing my nails their work was very rough. They were very rough with the tools and even ended up giving me a small bruise close to my nail. After my acrylics were done my nails hurt for a few days. As well as the work was so unprofessional and fast. They did my nails as if they were in a rush and didn't care of how my nails came out. Also the pricing was very unreasonable with my finished product. Just overall my experience was not a good one and i would definitely not recommend this place.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>If I had the option of putting zero stars I would because this place did a horrible job with my nails and eyelashes. They did my nails about two days ago and my nail already came off. In addition I got my eyelashes done there and had a terrible reaction to it and the lady there did not carefully put the glue on. Including aside from my bad experience at this nail salon the pricing was very high for such an unprofessional job.</review>< Pics>

But anyways great customer service !!!! They are very friendly , everyone speaks to you. they also provide you with water as soon as you sit down! I really liked this place because everything looks clean. My nails were done by Shelly she was great very nice and friendly , I like my nails but I feel like she could have shaped them better and paid closer attention to detail. Pricing is good paid 20$ for this set .< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Place looks very nice, but the owner does not know how to do long nails. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and my nails didn’t turn out looking nothing like the picture, I asked for coffin shaped nails and she gave them a flare shape and they were to thick, they looked horrible and tacky. She expected me to pay $80 and her work is not even good. I should have never wasted my time trying a new nail tech out.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Loved this nail salon.  My nails were done very beautifully and the way I wanted them to be done! Very reasonable priced. Friendly customer service. They served every customer with refreshments and also a holiday gift. Left from there feeling very special and satisfied!<//text>

<Review>Very good nail spa. But Do Not, I repeat, !DO NOT! get eyelash extensions or get your eyebrows waxed here. I Did the mistake of getting single eye lash extensions last week and I regret it deeply. Cheap quality lashes and glue. The lady left thick strips of glue along my lash lines. Few days later My natural eyelashes started coming off along with the false ones. $70 gone to waste ☹️

I did the mistake of not doing my research before getting eyelash extensions at this place. And that is why I am writing this to help anyone who is skeptical regarding eyelash extensions at this place. This place does an amazing job on manicures & pedicures, that is their specialty. But My advice to you; visit someone who specializes in eyelash extensions. Don't make the same mistake I did. You will regret it, just as I do.  👀</Review>< GmapID>

Super convenient place to have your storage space. Drive up is easy and the spaces are very well kept. Jaime arroyo helped us to the process and we couldn’t be happier with his customer service. He got us what we needed and was a pleasure to work with</text>

Started with a reservation and called before I move in my stuff. Michael was very very helpful. In and out in less than an hour. Rates are very practical and affordable. Storage spaces were clean. Highly recommended for a no-fuss storage space. Again, look for Michael and he’ll be more than willing to help you with all your needs.</text>

<Review>Let me start by saying, I don’t normally take the time to write reviews. However, I felt the need to share with others the amazing first class experience I had at this location. Evelyn Munkel assisted me with all my questions in regards to availability, sizes, pricing for all my storage needs. She was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, eager to ensure I was happy with my selection. I highly recommend anyone who may have storage needs to visit this location and ask for Evelyn!<//Review>< Rate>

I just rented a storage unit and found the initial rental process fairly easy.  The guy working behind the desk (Mike) was very friendly and helpful.  This seems like it will be a good rental.<//review>

This has been the best storage rental unit that I've ever rented. Reservation and paperwork were easy and straight forward. Unit was clean and locks were reasonably priced. Everyone who I've worked with has had a great attitude and has been more than willing to help me. It's also nice that the storage has cameras around. It makes me feel more safe going there alone.<//text>

I'm leaving three stars only because I'm hoping to get my situation resolved. In reality I believe this place is worth 0 stars or how they have treated me. I rented a unit many months ago, and after the first month I decided that I didn't want to rent a unit anymore. So on April 1st I called the office having already vacated my unit and told them that I would like to cancel my account. The lady on the phone said she couldn't do that without charging me for rent for the month of April. I felt that this was unfair but after some mild arguing, I gave in and said fine I'll pay for the month of April, but I'm not going to be using it feel free to give it to someone else. Yeah to me that sounds like my account should have been closed right? Wrong! Many months later I start getting bills in the mail and realize that the account is not closed and has remained open and has been occurring charges this whole time. I have sent numerous emails demanding that they closed my account, and have not gotten one reply. They record phone calls so I prefer not to call because I feel that's an invasion of privacy. So how else does one communicate with these people? I am very busy and do not have time to go into the office during normal office hours. It's the 21st century guys, email is the norm, why can't you guys use it? In writing this review, I am hoping to be able to contact somebody in the office preferably a manager, and let them know that there's no way I am paying them anymore money. They have sent things in the mail saying they're going to auction the stuff in my storage unit which is funny because my unit has been vacated since April 1st. So that would be a pretty disappointing auction. Currently I'm very disappointed in this business. My opinion might change slightly if the situation is corrected. I am in patiently waiting for a response.< /Text>

Patient customer service. One staff member ruined the experience so we moved elsewhere. I originally  gave this place 5 stars, changed my mind after a month. Best rates in the area.< /Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<response>None<//response><Name>Olive SanJuan</Name><pics>None< /pics><text>Storage places are hardly worth reviewing. But I'm compelled to review this one and give it 5 stars for 5 reasons: Exceptional customer service from Veronica A. who I thought was the manager based on her professional and pleasant demeanor, knowledge of the pricing plans and her willingness to extend us a great deal; The wonderfully clean and spacious place - from the office to the entire compound;  The fresh air and cool breeze that we got to enjoy during the chauffered ride to our unit; the price plan we were given which was very reasonable; And lastly - the free moving truck that came with our storage unit! We highly recommend this place! 👍</text>< Rating>

Not the absolute worst storage but I give them a 1 star for their customer service. Redondo Torrance MiniStorage charged me $50 and allowed someone I don't know to use my gate code after hours. Apparently they will lock you inside of the storage area after 8 PM and if you want to leave they will charge you $50 dollars. Its sounds highly illegal and also the fact that they are not verifying this is ACTUALLY you, is problematic. Customer service was extremely rude initially until they found out I really wasn't at the gate. They are still charging me the fee plus more fees totaling up to $136 because they said I had to have given my gate code to somebody to use. I am upset how they dealt with this scenario and I don't recommend anyone use this place.</Text>

Great local South Bay storage unit and great customer service. Jaime is a great manager and all the employees here are very friendly and welcoming! The booking and reservation process was pretty simple and straightforward, and they have little golf carts that will take you to your unit!<//text>

I've been a renter here for over two years, and the customer service has been stellar!

The whole staff at the Mini Storage are professional, friendly and knowledgeable.

I haven't had one bad experience with this facility.  It is always clean and organized.

The employees Jaime, Ally and Lee are always very pleasant and helpful.
I highly recommend Torrance Redondo Mini Storage for any of your storage needs.

*Also, their prices are much better than other storage facilities I researched.<//text>

I have to start by saying, this review is late in coming. I meant to write a review immediately after signing the agreement. Jaime and Ruben are amazing!!! They treated us like family even though it was our first time ever renting a storage unit. They both are very knowledgeable of the business they run and they handle it as their own, as a business owner myself I appreciate good customer service from my employees and this is what we received. Thank you Jaime and Ruben and God Bless!!!!< /Review>

Moved in for a few months to this Storage, and while I had a storage for a few months, the place wasn’t as clean, the section I was in, I would find empty beer cans and waste, like if someone would sleep there or hangout after hours. There were other storages that looked like they were broken in, a man came in once saying his lock was blended and needed a new one because someone tried to brake in.

When it came for me to move out, I moved out about 1-3days of the beginning of the month, they don’t pro rate and charge you the whole month amount which sucked because I’ve delt with other storage units and they are always great about pro rating. Also someone said to wait a day to see if the manager would consider pro rating the unit before I left, but manager Ronda never got back to me and I got charged a $15 late fee!

I tried to fight that because it was very unprofessional and unfair to be charged, to then promising to return the amount. It’s been over 3 months and I’m still trying to get those $15 back.. every time I call apparently the supervisor or manager is always “on vacation”
I’ve given them my information to mail me a check as promised and haven’t received anything yet.  Worst Storage company I’ve felt with, unprofessional and they make an excuse every time about passing any important information to the manager or supervisor.

Do not do business here!</review>

I had a great experience at Redondo Torrance Mini-Storage.  The staff and sales team are very friendly and helpful - they were happy to take me to see as many units as I needed to until I found just the right size.  They offer month-to-month rentals in a secure, clean environment.  I'm very happy with my decision to store my goods at this facility.< /review>

My initial contact was with Itofee, who is very pleasant on the phone. I was provided a perfect sized storage unit at a great price. The application and reservation over the phone was seamless and hassle free.  The Free truck was useful for the 1st hour, but I discovered it takes more time to move than expected and there is a rate for that. I referred a friend and got a considerable credit for that! I found only one downside: There is no dumpster on site which would be useful for getting rid of clutter when reorganizing your unit.</Review>

Aitofi is an exceptional example of customer service. I was stuck in traffic for two hours trying to make it to the storage on time and I just made it a few minutes before closing time and felt terrible. In most of my experiences in situations like this I walk into unpleasantness and attitude. I've been in retail for years so I understand. her friendliness and kindness made me feel so much more at ease and comfortable. I wasn't rushed and she took her time to assist me very kindly and welcoming.  Definitely changed my attitude on how I feel about customer service. I am very happy I found this spot regardless of my commute and because I'm leaving a whole ton of my precious furniture here.<//Review>

<Review>The manager at this location is unprofessional and incompetent. I vacated my unit on time and he said I should have signed some kind of document to let them know I was vacating the unit. However when I have given them my notice I spoke with Jesse (I guess it's his name) the guy who was in charge. He told me I just needed to vacate the unit and everything else would be okay. Three months later I receive a phone call from the manager saying that I owed them 3 months payment. I explained to him what I had been told by Jesse, he put on hold and I could overhear them talking and Jesse saying that he remembered me and "yes" he had told me that I just needed to vacate by the end of the month. Even though the supposed to be "manager" continued to threat me to send me to collection. I didn't agree to pay for the simple fact that I didn't use the service and also that I was misinformed about the notice to vacate. What happened then?! The damn "manager" sent my account to collection and ruined my credit as he had said so.
DON'T USE THEIR SERVICES!  THEY'RE UNPROFESSIONAL, THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY HAVE ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICES SKILLS.
Now I have to hire a lawyer to take care of this unnecessary issue caused by their lack of knowledge and unprofessionalism.
If someone knows the name of the "manager" please let me know.< /Review><Time>1558310424444</Time>< Pictures>

I went online ad came across Redondo Torrance MiniStorage and I was impressed with their prices initially. However, once I actually talked to Jaime on the phone, I was more eager to rent from them because of his excellent customer service. He invited me to come down to the facility to view the spaces, so I did. Once I got there, he was very knowledgeable about the available spaces and even helped me to make a more educated decision on the space I needed to store my belongings. Being a first time storage renter, I was really pleased with the way he took the time to explain the procedure and pricing in detail. Although other customers came in, I didn't feel rushed and that made me feel comfortable enough to do business with this company.</Text>

<Text>From the time I opened my account to the time I closed it due to relocation, I was treated exceptionally well and was 100% satisfied with the location, the ease-of-access, the cleanliness of the premises, as well as the positive attitude of the staff. They have such a "can do" attitude, and when I asked for additional help closing up my unit, Jaime came to the rescue. He was simply a delight to work with. They clearly care about customer service, and that's why I'll spread the word about this gem. Finally, I'm used to getting the runaround when closing an account of any sort. It was so incredibly easy to just clean out my unit and close my account. This made my stressful moving week much more manageable. Thank you, Redondo Torrance Mini Storage!< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
The experience was great overall with service and cleanliness.  My only problem was that I had to stay longer than three months due to my tenant refusing to vacate the home where the furniture was to go.  I paid the higher fees but left after only 7 days in September and had to pay for the whole month.  It seems that a break shoud be given to the lessee in these situations.   Maybe by breaking the month into two segments.

Thank you,

Maxine Brown<//review>

< Review>
I had the pleasure of working with Aitofi at Redondo Torrance Mini Storage. She made things so easy to understand how they operated,  the paperwork was simple and the facility was clean and organized.

Thank you for making Storage easy!< /Review>

<Review>I would not recommend this place to anyone. My fiancé and I called and reserved a storage over a month ago for a specific date with a specific price. When we go to move in on the date the manager that offered us that Price was not there, and still let us move all of our stuff in and now the day that we are leaving the country for seven months we get word that they cannot offer the deal they offered originally. This is terrible business. The manager (who is off site) and who you have to go indirectly through was extremely rude and would do nothing to help us. We are now in a position (leaving the country) that we cannot do anything about our stuff. I recommend going elsewhere for you storage. Being lied to, taken advantage off, and talked to like it was our fault is despicable.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) For more than two years paying, so that in December 2018 they broke the lock and not the lock. I lost what more valuable tools and climbing equipment ropes more than 150.00 dollars carabiners that antler. It gave me depression and no one took responsibility, report to the police so that it's just a waste of time they just showed me some pictures of how things were,

Perdí lo que más de valor herramientas y equipo de escalada cuerdas de más de 150,00 dolares mosquetones que asta. Me dio depresión y nadien se hizo responsable, reporte con la policía para que solo es una pérdida de tiempo solo me enseñaron unas fotos de como quedaron las cosas,</Review>

<text>My husband and I were married here and it was a very good experience! The woman at the front was nice, the man we signed our documents with and who married us was very nice. The wedding room looked so beautiful for where it was and we had time to take pics with family and friends. Overall, a very pleasant experience. 👍< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
I was in need of a birth certificate. First I filled out the application online then had to call to make an appointment. It took about 2 days to get through just calling the number. First day I was on hold for almost 2 hrs and hung up. Second day I called right when they opened and was on hold for only 20 min. They were able to get me in the next day do to a ton of cancelations. I walked in had my temp checked and appointment tag verified. Didn't even sit down. When straight to the window it said via text and a very kind women at window #9 helped me. I paid $28 for my birthday certificate and a $2 fee for using a card transaction.</review>

<review>Zero Stars. Called to talk to someone about recording docs and actually getting the recorded documents back in time to send the lien notice out, per the CA Civil Code...waited on hold for over 30 minutes only to have the lazy government employee tell to wait while she finds a supervisor...then hangs up on me after waiting another 20 minutes. All Government Employee Unions need to be eliminated and lazy gov't employees FIRED.<//review></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I was helped by Debbie in the Transfers Department.  Give this lady a big raise!  She listened to my situation and asked me relevant questions.  She looked at the recording documents AND confirmed to me that I am a 50% owner of our (sister and I each 50% owners) land in Adelanto, CA.  She patiently explained to me WHY my Grant Deed was worded the way it was and why it showed the percentages it did and the names it did.  I live in the State of Washington and transferred my 50% ownership of this property to my living revocable trust.  You don't need more details, other than Debbie treated me with respect and was patient with me.< /text>< pics>

<review>I was there today and the girl at the window counter had an attitude that is typical of someone that hates its job. I asked "Do you know what form I could use for change or ownership of a mobile home" she answer "I have no IDEA". But is this the county recorders office?..mmmmm we as customer could use a bit more of politeness and helpful answers.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Place is full of your stereotypical bad attitude overpaid under-worked too important to serve the public city 'workers'. It's even worse when you call and speak to someone. Everyone I have encountered at the County has been beyond rude after asking a simple question I've been stared at then responded to 'Okaaaaaaaaaaaay...?' Avoid like the DMV at all costs! And if you're getting married, don't sell yourself short and get hitched at this place you'll regret it!</Review>< Pics>

EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL had me pay twice for my birth cetificate totalling over $60.Had to drive all the way from my home in Nevada to pick it up in person because my ID and social security card along with a NOTARIZED form for the clerks office apparently was not enough identfying information for them to find me in the system via mail.Went to the clerks office expecting not to pay because it was their mistake!I did not even tell the women any information except for hand her my ID and she found my birth certificate right away!She told me i would have to pay again!Because I put the wrong names for my parents on my mail request form.Hmmmm thats interesting because when i came in office i put the SAME EXACT NAMES AS I DID ON MY MAIL REQUEST!Very displeased hope i NEVER have to come back here again SCAMMED ME OUT OF A LOT OF MONEY JUST FOR PROOF I WAS BORN IN SB COUNTY.</text>

As if the already ridiculous prices for documents weren't enough they also add an additional $2.50 for any card charges.</Review>

This morning I went to buy the promotion of 2 burritos of beef for 6 DLs, to give the first bite almost I swallow a huge stone that came in the burrito for little and breaks my teeth. They should be more careful in what they cook in Deltaco not a clean restaurant as they pass these things in the food is very bad taste should have the letter B or C<//text>

Riverside is my home town and I ALWAS make sure this place makes it in on my places to eat. Meat and cheese burrito stuffed with French fries!!! Got an extra one to take on the plane and eat for lunch even. My boys however had an urge for a greasy quesadilla but it wasn't greasy enough for them (lol), but they still enjoyed it!< /review>

<Text>After 5 great visits and 5 GREAT meals but tonight, we experienced a "HERO to ZERO" DINING FOLLY.
15 min waiting for the server then another 10 for the ordered glass of wine and chip/salsa tabletop norm.  The bartender brought my wife's Chardonnay because "our waitress left it on the bar". We had to track down a waitress to take our Bowl of soup and a Patty Melt order. 6 different times I then asked when was the soup made? Made to order, or pre-made in a warming pot? I was informed the Chicken Tortilla soup is made in the AM and served as ordered. Why then is my order taking 20 min? The same 6 employees repeatedly asked, "how we were doing"? We asked where is our order? Each said they didn't know since they didn't take our order. Sounds like the DMV, "NEXT WINDOW PLEASE" not my Dept!
Then we asked 1 more time to who seemed to genuinely care and said she was going to COMP our meal that buy now my wife had already eaten 1/2 of her Patty melt, me, STILL NO SOUP!
We got up and drove home so I could make a bowl of Campbells Soup!</Text>< Pictures>

We came here on Thanksgiving as we were passing through and it was the only place open. The workers were incredibly nice and never seemed inconvenienced even though I’m sure they’d rather be home. Food was good and served promptly.<//Text>

I appreciate that they are open late so I can get a bite to eat after work. And, I shouldn't forget to mention they have decent fish taco and dollar menu.<//review>

This del taco is the worst i have been to and it happens to  the closet fast food to me. The food is ALWAYS cold no matter what time of the day and if you want some thing without sauce you better get ready for a ton on sauce. F this place save money and go hungry.</review>

Too damn hot outside for these stoned employees to forget my items, I came at 11:50 am and order two beyond meat burritos and a beyond meat combo however only received the burrito and nothing else didn’t realize until about 5 min on the road checked my receipt and I had indeed been charged for a combo, chose not to go back because I have to be back at work basically paid for a combo to only receive the burrito first time visiting this location and will definitely be my last.<//Text>

Past few times I’ve been here, either the food gets worse, or the ingredients change.. I am someone who gives a place a few chances before giving up. But I am sad to say this is my first 1 star review. So to my thoughts; I order the chicken burrito combo mostly, there’s hardly any chicken to it, and my last one was more of a salad than a burrito... if I wanted a salad I would have made one myself.. and the fries... have you completely forgotten to put salt on your fries? That’s one my top favorite items is the crinkle cut fries WITH salt! And as for the drinks, probably need to check the system you use, or the expiration dates.. it’s eothe flat or too syrupy! So with that I’m not returning to this particular establishment!<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I liked this place because they are one of the only places open after I get out of work at 5am, however i will no longer be buying food from this establishment because of the lazy employees, whoever was working there at 6am today 12/21/2017 gave me the most unprofessional response when I asked for an order for two people. She just had attitude. Ya know what they say about happy costumers, they tell 1 person about their good experience, unhappy ones, tell 10.</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Our dinner was awesome. Make sure you take the Del Taco's survey. The survey will save you a $1 on every $3 you spend. We saved $4 tonight because I ordered four times. I already did a survey upon walking in. I ordered and after getting my new receipt, my daughter fills out the survey. I am a single Dad of three Kids and dinner would have costed $13.50 but because of the surveys, it costed $9.50.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>It's close to work and on most days we swing by it to get breakfast before work.  It's your basic Del Taco so it's not breathtakingly amazing food, but what you see is what you get.  I give them high marks for getting people in and out of their drive through fast.<//Review>< pics>

I order the 8 layer veggie with no cheese or sour cream, add avocado at 50 cents a sliver.</Review>

The employees be holding out with the whip cream for the mini shakes. The employees say the mini shakes don't come with whip cream but the picture Del Taco advertises does. My lady can't stand the Del Taco on 14th & Brockton because of this.<//Text>

<Text>Dont really like coming to this del taco. When we order tacos we will usually  receive a few with very little meat. Good thing there's another one up the street that knows what they're doing.

6/14/2020
Freaking hate getting food from here! Bf asked for two carne asada nachos and 6 chicken burritos. He repeated himself SEVERAL TIMES! He ended up getting charged for 8 and they didn't even have enough chicken to make all 8! Top it off we got ground beef nachos.. not carne asada.. whoever took the order tonight, maybe you should stop... Or get better training. I tell bf to avoid this place.. there's a better del taco up the street.... Very disappointed.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Poor excuse for food and employees, evertime I go here they put my tacos in the bags upside down, they always make me wait 5 to 10 minutes before they take my order, usually I have to start yelling at the box to get them to acknowledge me. To top it off all the employees have poor attitudes and just now the employee wouldn't even take my order because she just didn't want to do a order that large, I was only ordering 4 burritos. Lazy, poor attitudes and they always ruin the food I'm absolutely done with this place.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Didn't like having to buy something before I was given a token so I could use the restroom there. It was a real emergency too, I was really feeling sick.
I barely made it in time. I bought two tacos, which I picked up from the counter after my restroom emergency.
Apparently someone else was given a token and opened the door to the loo while I was still using it. Nightmare experience here, I would recommend a bed of sharp spikes before endorsing this shack.</Review>

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with light/easy beans and they ignored that I also ordered jalapeño poppers and they were completely cold. Make sure to get your receipt when you come here. Go to another one if you can.< /review>

This is the best del taco in riverside. We have 3 del tacos near our house but we drive 15 minutes out of our way to come to this one. Everything is always fresh and delicious! They know a thing or 2 about quality! Good job guys!</Review>

I've been to this Del Taco at least 50 times over the last year and the service has never disappointed. The manager (owner?) is almost always present, pleasent, and friendly.
The entire staff is attentive and polite.
Service is always quick and I don't think I have ever received my order incorrectly. The french fries may be hit or miss, but ingredients are fresh as is the Del promise.
The dining area is well maintained, cleaned, and stocked.   I have no complaints about this eatery and will stop in anytime I need a taco fix.
24 hour drive-thru is another perk.</Text><UserId.>106279681349258458154</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

This establishmentis dirty an full of lazy employees. the floors look like they havnt been swept in a week or so. there is a broken marijuana pipe near the restroom with shards of glass everywhere. An the manage feels it's ok to walk around with his chest an tattoos hanging out. A true piece of trash here.< /text>

I like Del Taco alot and I tend to go to multiple stores. They all seem to keep a solid quality and consistency but I don't feel this is a great representation.  The portions are far smaller in all the items , which alters the taste signicantly . Lettuce seems the only thing in abundance. I would understand small portions of meat (more exspensive) tomatoes , unions ,  beans, etc.  are in low amount . There's plenty of del tacos in the area , take the extra trip .< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Food is not prepped well. The drive thru service is horrible. Expect to wait 15 - 30 minutes in the drive-thru. It's always 50/50 as too wether or not you will get your order correct. If you pay for $10 worth of food expect to get the wrong bag with $5 worth of food. This is just one of the most horrid places to eat. Just avoid it and go to Del Taco on La Sierra Ave.<//Text>< pics>

The carne asada cheese fries were cold (the few flakes of cheese wasn't melted), epic steak and potato burrito was cold. But all of the sides we're there and the asada burrito was warm.<//review>

9/5/16 Been in line for over a half hour with one truck in front of me waiting to order and cars behind me . Call and ask why is it taking so long and get hung up on by a female.  Have about 5 people working and having to wait this long to not have order right and argue about giving me my change back by the driver thru worker name Brenda. Very horrible service.</review>

The service here has gone down in the last few years. They are always forgetting something from the order and there are times where i order a quesadilla with extra cheese and it never weighs the same and sometimes not even cooked. Very disappointing< /text>
