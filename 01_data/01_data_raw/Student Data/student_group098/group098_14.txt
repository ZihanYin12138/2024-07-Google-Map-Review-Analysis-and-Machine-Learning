Hi taco Bell is always good for a quick bite. Love the chalupas.  I really don't like to say anymore any negative words like I have said for other places in the past. Especially now that most places are really working hard to keep open the restaurants and fast food places. Do to the Pandemic it's terrible for everyone. God bless America 🙏< /Text>

This seems like mismanagement to me, as the items replacing these ones are clearly designed to be cheap to make at the expense of tasting like anything but a misuse of nacho style cheese sauce. That stuff belongs on nachos, not in burritos. Gross.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Awesome customer service,y order was wrong due to hearing wrong. I personally know how frustrating that is, since I wear hearing aids in both ears and still can't hear to well. Anywho they fixed it and let me keep the other it. Oh yeah they no longer have the other item I asked for rather.< /review>

<Review>Ordered through the mobile app today to make things easier for everyone. Got to the location, pulled forward to the window, and got no real greeting. He handed me the drinks and immediately asked me to pull out of the driveway and into the parking lot next door to wait for my food. Waited a few minutes & the food came out. Got home to find the chips are stale for the triple layer nachos, potatoes are wayyyyy over cooked so they are hard, did not get the nacho chips substituted in my meal box for which I paid extra for, taco was soggy like it had been waiting for awhile to be given in an order. This whole order was awful and this is not the first time they failed to give me the nachos instead of the cinnamon twists. I'll be going to the other location from now on.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dd28a7738ba121:0x784ae41b74918a61<//gmap_id>< Rate>

Went through drive thr I order my food but I noticed when I pulled up to the window the cashier was helping with making the food he was using the same latex gloves on the food after touching the cash or money it was horrible and than he notice that i noticed and he got so nervous so I asked him what's ur name are u the manager he said yes my name is Carlos but in the recipe it said Billy B I end up throwing food away do to covid 19 I didn't want to risk my life over this nucle head I can't believe he is the manager wow corporate needs to address this asap check cameras and ask this employees if they are not happy working there than go elsewhere and don't take it out on public also their attitude sucks, this is my recipe #365326 date 8/15/20 11:45:15pm<//text>

takes mobile orders at 11:29 then when you arrive at 11:45 to pick up your food, they insist that they’re closed. now i’m forced to file a complaint to get my money back from my *~legitimate~*order that they didn’t want to prepare. use some common sense and eat elsewhere.<//review>

<Text>Ehhhh, not impressed.

I ordered a shredded chicken burrito for $2.78. The first 3 bites were just rice. Eventually I got to some chicken, but just a tad.
$2.78?
Really Taco Bell?
I also ordered a bean and cheese burrito that seemed to be twice the size as this useless chicken burrito.

Not only fast food- worthless fast food.

I am giving it 2 stars cause the employee was very nice.</Text><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

It's taco bell. We all love our taco bell. This location however did mess up on the order and when addressing the mistake, i did ask for my item to be fixed, not replaced. The lady behind me said outloud, make sure she doesn't throw that away, but was ignored.  The girl at the register quickly disposed of my taco instead of just fixing it.  What a shame . Communication gets a thumbs down.<//Text>

I ordered two items. A bean and rice burrito and another item.  It took over twenty minutes to get my order.  I asked what was taking so long.  I was told " we do the larger orders first."
How about first come first served.<//text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>My sister ordered the steak burrito that must have been a foot long, covered in cheese and enchilada sauce. I asked for their spiciest hot sauce and they brought out a home made habanero sauce, so delicious! If I'm ever back in Montrose I'm definitely hitting this place up again! Service was great, attentive and very welcoming!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

The food here is fresh and tastes good, but be mindful to check your orders to make sure everything you ordered is in the bag (I've only gone here through the drive-thru), because they have forgotten to give me an extra taco and an order of cinnamon twists on separate occasions.  It also does not help that this location does not give you a receipt every time you go through the drive-thru.</Text>

I get it I work in fast food as well we all have those rude customers, horrible busy days, don't want too deal with anyone.  you kinda get over customer service really quick ...  But the fact that he has so much enthusiasm and ensured we received our whole meal makes me want too come back .. Keep it up!!</text>< Pictures>

I was so sick right after eating here.  I suspect it was food poisoning but it had me vomiting and up all night running to the toilet.  Will never eat at any Taco Bell from now on.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Phenomenal
But it's not Mexican food ..
It's "Mexican style" food
If you want good street style tacos from mexico or type, well no.
A taco bell style cue consists of
A golden tortilla almost like toast in the shape of taco lettuce cheese and meat of the drinks not to mention are those of the typical fast food restaurants (there are no Mexican drinks of any kind)
It's not bad criticism, it's just the truth

(Original)
Fenomenal
Pero no es comida mexicana..
Es comida "estilo mexicana"
Si quieres unos buenos tacos del estilo callejeros de mexico o tipo asi pues no.
Un taco estilo taco bell consiste en
Una tortilla dorada casi como una tostada con forma de taco lechuga queso y carne de las bebidas ni hablar son las de los tipicos restaurantes de comida rapida (no hay bebidas mexicanas de ningun tipo)

(Translated by Google) Passing here is something exciting I like all the employees give a good service when what happens is that it is annoying that there is a lot of homeless that annoy customers that is the most annoying because they have money and spend it asking for more money It gives a bad impression at the beginning but then they tell them that it is time for Irae some get angry with them. Thanks for good service

(Original)
Pasar aca es algo emocionante me agradan todos los empleados dan un buen servicio cuando paso lo que si es molesto es que a un lado tenga muchos homeless que molestan alos clientes eso es lo mas molesto porque ellos tienen dinero y se la pasan pidoendo mas dinero eso le da una mala impresion al principio pero luego ellos los empleados les dicen a ellos que ya es hora irae algunos se enojan con ellos.

They were so pleasant and I was able to have my 2 duplicate keys- cut and paid and back to my car in under 10 minutes. Such a nice man! I’d recommend them for sure- Home Depot had only the predictable limited options in my situation.< /Text>

Excellent and quick service by "Joe J." today making a duplicate key for my older Ford. He has all the fancy equipment to show that the key *does* have a chip in it (i thought it did not) and do the programming - something did not work the first time with the result that he threw out a chipped blank and did not charge me for it - very nice!<//Review>

Excellent Customer Service.  Called for a re key of my house and was given an appointment for the next morning.  Super fast response time.  The locksmith that came to my home was Jessie.  He called to tell me he was on his way, arrived on time an was professional, courteous and got the job done quickly.  Would highly recommend California Locksmith and Jessie!< /Text>

New manager, new attitude and lack of follow through or care of customer service. The manager is someone from another shop which was the reason I stopped going to that shop -- now he's there.

<review>Paul was super cool! I lost my spare 2015 cmax keys. I called a few places and got the best rate and service from Paul. He Provided me a quote and sent out a technician same day since I had to drive north for my moms surgery that night! Great process when the tech arrived. When he opened the car he asked me to check in case the fob was in there and maybe the battery died. Smart thinking, unfortunately not in there. The tech was quick and informed me of all the options and requirements before he performed the service. Thank you!!!< /review>< Time>

<review>Called them on a Saturday before coming in. They had a trade show to go to at Disneyland but they still went ahead and waited for me and made the copy of my Browne car key so I could get on my trip. They really didn’t need to wait. Example of exemplary service. $25 to make the keys and $5 for the battery< /review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This place is great. I needed 5 different locks rekeyed (3 for my house and 2 for my sister’s). I called around on a Saturday at 11am to a few different places and this was the only place that would give me a firm price on what they would charge. They also closed at noon but when I told them that I wouldn’t get there until noon, they said that was fine. They stayed open and took care of everything I needed. If I need something keyed, this will be the only place I go. I love great customer service and that is what I got here.< /Review>

Changing locks, re-coding locks, obtaining new key copies for both residential and commercial properties. Their prices are extremely reasonable and their services are seriously the BEST!!!

<Rate>4</Rate><text>We were on vacation and lost the rental car key. CA locksmith security was quick, friendly and efficient! It was quite costly because of the technical knowledge required to reprogram an electronic key, but they were the only ones that knew how to do it and we were back on the road. Thanks for your help! Makes it tough on a tight budget!!!</text><date>1516942391732</date><userid>110585156395386399548<//userid>< Name>

What a great experience!! I've lost my BMW car keys and wasn't sure what to do, I called and got amazing customer service right away, Eric came and made a key for us in less than 1 hour, also the price was much better than any other option we had (the dealer was $129 more expensive).
Thank you guys for all your help I would definitely recommend you to my friends and family if ever in need.< /Text>

My key dropped out of my pocket and down a storm drain in the torrential downpour today. From the time CA Locksmith was called through dispatch and programming the key, the service was top notch. Cody had a bit of a difficult time getting the key programmed using the latest equipment, but was able to use a previous technological contraption and that did the trick. Cody, you rock my world and I will gladly recommend your company!</Review>

<review>California Locksmith Security Solutions notified me 15 minutes before arriving. Eden, the owner of CA Locksmith, was very courteous, very knowledgable and took the time to show me what was wrong with the locking mechanism on my french door. I got lucky as he had replacement part in his van, so he was able to fix the lock immediately. Eden worked quickly and diagnosed the problem in under 10 minutes. From scheduling the appointment to getting my lock fixed, everyone I talked to was very courteous and friendly. Best of all, the cost to repair the locking mechanism on my french door was very reasonable. I highly recommend California Locksmith.<//review>< Time>

Thank you, Cody! I called today for a quote and the price was right and Cody changed 4 locks and made me 6 keys in less then 30 mins. Also he took the time to realign one of our locks that was jamming up. Great service, thanks!<//Review>

He had someone come out to me in Anaheim an hour or two later, once the technician arrived he was in and out within 10-15 minutes.

Idan is the greatest locksmith we have ever encountered.

We moved into a house that has a 50 year old Baldwin Mortise lock on the front door.  It wasn't working correctly and we had taken it apart ourselves, which was a big mistake because we could not get all the pieces back together! ... As a result, the lock box no longer worked correctly and they are very expensive to replace new.

Long story short, we found Idan on Yelp and he was able to repair the mortise lock in less than an hour.

While performing the repair, he was also able to make other adjustments to the springs and to the key barrel, and the lock is now working perfectly.  Idan explained every step he took to repair the lock and encouraged repairing mortise locks over simply replacing with new ones.

Overall, he provides top notch customer service and has a vast knowledge of how mortise locks operate.  We highly recommend him for any locksmith services.<//text>

Only place that gave me a straight answer. Lost both keys to the mini van.  They came by and took care of it. There was a small problem, the tech got a flat tire and had to reschedule for the following day, but that was no biggie because they communicated it and we were rescheduled. 2nd time using them and will use again if needed.<//Text>

<text>One of the sloppiest manicures I've ever received. I think I had the head boss lady herself did mine and she was terrible. Super rough and painful with the tools, filed my nails and then put lotion on me with all of the dust from the file still all over my hands, didn't use a base coat, did properly cover my nails with the color, and then didn't properly cover the color with the top coat. The best way I can describe what she did is slapping polish onto my nails. Sloppy sloppy sloppy. You get what you pay for I guess.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I went in for gel manicure I hope this at least saves a few girls from going here you would think it’s just gel right how bad can it be well it was the WORST my nails look like melted jelly beans. I sincerely think I could have personally done a better job I would strongly recommend going somewhere else.< /Text>

My experience was horrible. The tall guy did my foot for pedicure but it's very obvious he doesn't know how. He was trying his best but please come on. It was better if i did the cleaning myself. My god! The lady who did my hand, she was okay but still not satisfactory. I don't recommend this nail salon.<//Text>

I went to go get my nails done and the guy that did them cut me in each finger then he smushed the nail polish, also didn’t leave them even, and charged even more than what they had said. NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN!!!< /Text>

Took my wife here to get her nails done for our daughter birthday party, and they attended her right away but it took 1 1/2 to do her full set nails were not cut even, the they cut her like 3 times plus 5 nails were crooked.

No recomendaría a nadie que venga aquí, la razón principal es que nos hemos dado cuenta de que no todas las herramientas del uso están debidamente desinfectadas. Después de que se usa una herramienta en un cliente, lo único que hacen es lavarla con alcohol y procesarla para utilizar las mismas herramientas exactas en el siguiente cliente. ¡Por este motivo específico, mi madre terminó contagiando una infección por hongos de la uña! Esto no es aceptable. Por esta razón principal, no te recomiendo que vengas aquí.< /Text>< time>

I have been with AAA for many years. I have 3 polices with them. Always paid on time and never had to file an auto claim. They raised the premium for my auto insurance this year. I called but the customer represantive was not able to lower the price. I’m going with another company that offered me better coverage and way cheaper premiums.</Text>

Went in to get an International drivers licence and they were helpful, quick and efficient.  If you are a AAA member, the photos are cheeper.  There isn't much paperwork and the licence is good for a year.  Didn't have to rush to get there because their new hours are until 6 pm.<//text>

Printer for registration was down and branch does not keep a supply of toner cartridges on hand to keep equipment running. Toner cartridges are on auto ship to this branch I would recommend if you are going to drive an hour out of your way on your lunch break that you call and confirm they are able to provide services as advertised to prevent a waste of your time.<//review>

Daniel's company is by far one of the most honest and best costumer service out there. From the receptionist that answer the phone the first time I contact them, she was friendly and really helpful. They reach out to me supper fast, and were hands on right away. My first appointment was really easy to set up, Daniel was flexible with the time and date I provided. Not to mention he really cares about his costumers, and we will be in contact with you, whenever you have a question. Not to mention he always gives out an update text, to let you know he's on his way to your home. Which I found really convenient. He has an awesome personality, and will explain in detail how he will be executing his plan to solve your problem. We had a rodent problem and after 3 weeks later our house is rodent free. I will definitely be using his services in the future. Totally recommend !<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Daniel is the man!
He is very professional, punctual, and above all else is very outstanding!
First he came and took care of my roof rat problem.
i also asked about doing a spray for insects and since he a was already doing me 1 service he gave me a pretty sweet discount.
during the whole time he was here he was explaining all the chemicals he was using and the best part was they were pet friendly. after he left the next day I found a ton of dead bugs mainly pincher bugs which amazed me how good his product actually worked! Daniel has a great personality and he loves dogs! He asked if he could take a picture with my brand new Belgian Malinois
check them out!</Review>< pictures>

The landlord was using another company and couldn't seem to get rid of them! Found this company by a quick internet search. Outstanding pest solutions had the best reviews on yelp and google!! Not only were they quick, they were also thorough!! The complete interaction was perfect from start to finish. From the young lady who answered the phone, to the owner, and finally the gentleman who showed up and provided the service. It has been just over a month and I haven't seen any bugs (dead or alive) in a few weeks!! Great company with great service. I definitely recommend them to take care of your bug needs. Thanks again Outstanding Pest Solutions!!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>Outstanding is the right name. This company is truly outstanding. From the first contact with customer service to the owner to the tech, everyone is very professional and so friendly. Their communication is awesome. They keep you informed of everything they are doing and contact you to confirm appointments
Last week I had a scheduled appt and they contacted me the day before  to let me know it was going to rain and I couldn't get the best benefit from the service. They set another appt  for when the weather was better. That is what I call customer service,  That shows real consideration when they check the weather the day before your appt. Daniel was great when I first called evaluating what we needed. I had called around to a few other companies but it was Daniel's personally and affordable prices that made me call back and I'm so glad I did.  He sent Adrian out to be our personal tech, we have the same tech each time  and he has provided us with great service. He is always on time,  texting when he is on his way,  he is knowledgeable, courteous and very friendly.  This company definitely gets a two thumbs up  !!!

My house had a couple different spiders including black widows. Daniel eliminates them all. He comes routinely. U can tell he loves his job. Takes great pride. Which means great service for me. Everything he uses is safe bc I have  10 month old and pregnant with the second. Check him out! Thanks Daniel</text>

<Review>What can I say about Outstanding Pest Solutions. I had a different company come to my house and spray for spiders. That company  sprayed my house and did absolutely nothing to rid my house of spiders. I called OPS and spoke with Daniel. I was a bit apprehensive but decided to give OPS a chance. Daniel and one of his service professionals showed up to my and did a AWESOME AWESOME job of ridding me of the spiders. It's been 2 months since OPS treated my home and to date I haven't seen not a spider. Along with his SUPERB care of my home Daniel also gave me a great educational lesson on spiders and other creatures that inhabits my area.

If you're thinking about using Outstanding Pest Solutions you don't need to call anyone else.... I PROMISE YOU BE HAPPY AND SATISFIED WITH HIS AMAXING SERVICES!!!! To top it all off OPS take care of your home for low low cheap prices!!!!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dca715ef55c62d:0xcb2d76216d5add4</Gmap_id>< rate>

<Review>10/10 5-Star service!!! I would highly recommend working with Outstanding Pest Solutions for any of your pest control needs. We had a huge cockroach and ant problem in our backyard and along the perimeter of our home, but after one spraying it was solved. Adrian the Specialist and Daniel the scheduling guy are professional and personable. Thank you Outstanding Pest Solutions!<//Review><GmapID>0x80dca715ef55c62d:0xcb2d76216d5add4</GmapID><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

<review>The service is great. I like that they text the day before to remind me of my appointment. Adrian always texts when he is on his way. He's always very prompt, friendly, and thorough. The ants are terrible this year so this has really helped. And no more black widows.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Adrain was extremely professional and was flexible in trying to work with our hectic schedule!  He was very thorough in spraying both inside and outside of our house, including the garage!  We have 2 dogs and a bunny rabbit, and he explained how long we needed to let everything dry so that it wouldn’t be toxic to our fur babies.  I will definitely be using this company in the future!<//Review>

<Review>I move to Moreno Valley on May 2020 and everything was good into every morning I wake up with cockroaches almost everywhere I even find one in my bed and let’s not talk about the back yard. I call outstanding pest solution and problem solve I did see only one cockroach death the next morning but that was it. Outside I only see death cockroaches and their service is outstanding, Adrian is really friendly and professional I highly recommend their service.< /Review>< pics>

I contacted Outstanding Pest Solutions because I had a very bad infestation of Earwigs. Since the first time Adrian applied pest control and removal of wasp nest and spider webs a few months back I have not had any pest problems. I like that there’s no contract and every three months I receive a text reminder if I need for them to come out. Adrian is courtesy, friendly, professional and always very pleasant I enjoy his outstanding personality!!!!<//text>

<Review>We live on a 1/2 acre lot surround with tons of vegetation (weeds) which is the ideal environment for earwigs. I was actually losing my mind killing upwards of 10 a night INSIDE my house and literally hundreds outside at any given time. I contacted Daniel with Outstanding Pest Solutions out of sheer desperation.

* RESULTS: Immediate results. Earwigs (and all other bugs) virtually disappeared. I've literally found 1-2 inside the house a month (versus the 10 a day I was finding prior). For weeks afterward we found PILES of dead bugs who couldn't get into the house past the pesticide barrier. Five weeks later, still NO earwigs. He just came back for maintenance.

* PROFESSIONAL: Prompt and friendly customer service. Answers calls and texts immediately in between jobs, but stays off his phone while he's on site (very professional). Texts to confirm days before, 24 hours and when he's on the way. Wore shoe covers inside our home and a mask.

* QUALITY SERVICE: Extremely thorough. Takes his time to spray every inch of the property. No entryway into the house was left untouched. Also spider and wasps nests removal included in service.

* SAFE : Provides a list of chemicals (amounts) used. Very knowledgeable and explained all materials used to make me feel very safe having dogs. Provided license number.

* Fairly priced. No pressure to pay for a particular schedule/frequency.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I want to thank Daniel James of Outstanding Pest Solutions for his pest control services of my house. Last summer was the first time we were ant free! He also eliminated spiders and pantry mosquitoes. Give him a call before the warm weather season brings in all the little critters! No monthly contract!<//Review></record>

We were starting to have a problem with earwigs so I needed to find a pest control place. I reached out to Outstanding Pest Solutions and Daniel responded almost immediately. He was able to fit me in quickly and was very communicative in calling the day before to confirm the appointment. He didn't give me a large window like a lot of places do - he provided a specific time (noon) and texted about thirty minutes before arrival to keep me updated. He was efficient while here and did more than I expected. I had asked about the earwigs but he also removed spider webs and wasps nests that I didn't even know I had. If you're looking for a friendly effective pest control company Outstanding Pest Solutions is who you should hire.<//text>

This morning I contacted Outstanding Pest Solutions, Daniel was very nice and friendly, he explained the services he offered, I was Pleased because this is what I was looking for, Daniel came to my home, he explained the type of chemicals he would be using for exterior and interior of my home. Daniel is Knowledgeable about his work. I recommend Outstanding Pest Solutions to everyone looking for Pest Control...by the way I only had to pay for services today which was 69 dollars, I thought I was suppose to pay for services today plus the bi-monthly payment, Daniel said No you only pay the 69 dollars and in two months you'll pay the bi-monthly payment. How Awesome is that!!!! Outstanding Pest Solutions is the way to go!!!<//Review>

Had Daniel out today to help with our pest problems. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable. After giving us they help we needed, the change around the house was night and day. We could go outside without being attacked by anything and everything. Thank you so much! Will definitely recommend and have him back in the future.</text>

This is the best pest control company around. Daniel came out and he is by far the best at what he does. He is passionate with pest control and probably loves his job a little too much but that's ok with me and for any customer who hires him too. Daniel, if you read this review I want you to know that my family and I appreciate you very much and we are happy with the service you provide. We will happily see you at the next monthly service. Thank you!</review>

Daniel is very professional and knows his stuff.  I had been dealing with a house mouse for about 6 weeks I had called out another pest control company that did absolutely nothing to resolve the problem when I contacted Daniel he has gone above and beyond the Call of Duty. The mouse was caught after 1 week of Daniel setting up his traps. He deserves more than 5 star I give him 10 stars. Very happy and will always use this company for any of my pest needs

I had been having issues for months with German roaches and the technician immediately provided results after the first visit. I felt like the other companies were giving me the run-around.

<Text>New to Moreno Valley and I am so glad I came across this company! Daniel is amazing and makes sure to explain everything that he will be doing. He was on time. I had a REALLY bad tick situation nothing like I had ever seen before when he came out and did his thing the difference was unbelievable there was still a few left (normal) taking into consideration how many I had he came back at no additional charge that same week I believe it was about two days after I called him. With an awesome attitude. After the 2nd time he sparred I have not seen one tick and it’s been a couple of weeks. Definitely recommend this company!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

#JusticeForDamian @DamiansAdvocate

My family suffered greatly over false allegations made by a bitter relative. Shortly after being placed under the supervision of DCFS, my daughter was hospitalized and later my son would lose his life. You won't hear my story making the mainstream news because their agenda is to take more children away from their parents.
Moms and Dads pay close attention and fight for your kids. If the county council says things about you that are completely wrong, make sure you or your attorney speaks up. Don't let their lies be put on record and not challenge it.
Also, our children were covered by our own private health insurance, but the social worker altered our court's affidavit regarding our income in order to fraudulently obtain Medi-cal insurance. My children were not declared a dependent or made ward of the court but the department already had them receiving services without our knowledge or consent.
In our case the judge always did what the social worker recommend and didn't bother looking at our evidence. Also don't hire The Law Offices of Vincent W Davis and Associates. He is not a CPS Expert and he'll assign an inexperience lawyer to lose your case.< /Review>

Welcome to the most corrupted and broken system practices of Los Angeles County. This location demonstrates a booming business in Human trafficking of small children, illegal adoption and detention. This courthouse will alienate you from your children and medicate them with psychotropic medication by means of  sedation causing long term toxic stress syndrome. The head judicial supervisor recently gave up his position because of the ongoing overwhelming complaints of inhouse public abuse. This place needs to be shut down!! The FBI is willfully neglecting and independent investigation regarding obstruction of justice and public abuse. The social workers, attorneys, judges and CASA Advocates are all defrauding parents for profit. Their system is running out of money and they want the parents to compensate for a failing bias system who lacks social justice. Social workers are being groomed to slander plarents and traffic children inorder to receive BIG BONUSES. This entity will force adoption upon children who are not adoption ready. If you know better, report the social workers and judges, and public offenders to: CA State Legislature, Judicial Commissions, Local County Board of Supervisors, DCFS Headquarters, The State of California Bar of Association, and California State Licensing Board, Community Care Licensing, Los Angeles County Health Department Headquarters, U.S. Justice Department, and Gov. Jerry Brown. Trump is aware of this well known abuse but has failed countless children and families being rapped by this system. My children were assaulted, neglected, kidnapped and abused while in "DCFS" care. Don't be afraid to report them! The more written complaints generated would expose this money driven system. This courthouse does not believe in justice but unethical systematic approaches. Any time your public offender doesn't handle your case sufficiently; fire them for mal-practice and negligence. (The waiting areas are so humid and exposed to direct sunlight which causes heat exhaustion to waiting families). In the cover photos you'll see pyramids everywhere all over their building indicating the Illuminati agenda to destroy families. This establishment is predominantly ran by white supremacist whom thrives off of power, greed and abuse. Be aware!!!<//review>

Oh my god the child Dependency lawyers, judges, and the childrens law group lawyers Band together and talk before make deals behind the backs of their clients I don’t think that it is ethical to make decisions regarding the lives of children prior to even speaking with the clients and that is what I am clearly noticing went and probably has been going on for a while unchecked. This can be a huge problem because they just seem to ignore the facts and keep dragging situations along to help feed the piper with no solid watchdog to maintain they are doing the right things they are allowed to spin peoples lives around to keep social workers, counselors, advocates, and whoever else benefits from our lives being unlawfully being intruded upon. To feel them working be careful</text>

<text>Circus. Lawyers are rude. They don't listen at all. They try and use reverse physiology as though they are the police and when you do ask them a question they make you seem like you're asking one with no relevance only to then turn around and contradict themselves. Very long drawn out process
they on purpose make you feel like you won't get the kids back. They ask the kids what they want with teddy bears backpacks and gifts so that the kids remain in foster. It is all a money game. They are very insensitive very mean and plain nasty. Unprofessional. Everyone seems to be just practicing.< /text>< Pictures>

Place is clean. Great views. Considering folks are not pleased to be there; the atmosphere is ok. If you need to stay during lunch they will give each family member (w/ children) a voucher for a meal. Really its up to $8 off per person. That came in handy. Stay positive and respectful, no matter what.< /Review>

CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED EVERY DAY IN THIS COURT! All they do is lie on parents and try to adopt their kids for CASH! Government sanctioned kidnapping. NO PROOF IS NEEDED. All someone has to do is accuse you because they are mad at you or because they are foster parents and want to keep their gravy train coming and this court will legally separate you from your children. And this is if you have passed all their requirements such as parenting class, mental health evaluation, home study, etc. I passed everything and an angry family member who wanted my kids wrote an email about me and they are now trying to adopt my babies. I had several other family members send emails stating that this one family member was dishonest but they ignored all of those letters and instead focused on the one that fit their story line. And of yes they have a story line and will try to make it true by suppressing evidence that shows it not to be true. THE PARKING GARAGE ONLY ACCEPTS 💰 💵 CASH! It’s all about the dollar at EDELMAN CHILDRENS COURTHOUSE.

This court operated on hearsay, bribes, retaliation, intimidation, conspiracy and most of the all those involved are child abusers themselves and will our your child in a WORSE situation.  Moreover, they have agents throughout the city who are also getting kickbacks to lie on you. NEVER TALK TO THEIR AGENTS WITHOUT A CAMERA OR TAPE RECORDER. They change your words around and exaggerate. Always use your phone to record and if they refuse to let you, then refuse to deal with them. Do not let them in your home without a warrant and if you can avoid them knowing the whereabouts of your kids because they love to take them from daycare and school. Never give them your kids information like their birthdates or social security numbers. Why make it easy on them when they are going hard on you! You can have 20 people say you are a stellar mom and citizen but if you have one enemy willing to lie, that’s all they need to take your child forever and place them with an actual predator!</text>

<review>This is the ABSOLUTE WORST CHILDRENS COURT AND DCFS DEPARTMENT IN THE US. The case worker LIE AND JUDGE WITH PREJUDICE. They have no intent to REUNIFY FAMILIES AND SCRUTINIZE PARENTS. They do not operate on understanding or try to FIND THE TRUTH IN ANY SITUATION THEY COME TO TAKE CHILDREN WITH NO FACTS THEN DO THE BARE MINIMUM OR NOTHING AT ALL TO GRANT REUNIFICATION. Your kids go up for adoption before your rights are taken away. Your granted visitation yet never get to see your KIDS! Worst of all they don’t let family adopt or give placement with family unless your case worker LIKES YOU.<//review>< Rating>

This court system is ridiculous it took away my best friends for stupid aligations that didn't even get investigated I also got told personally by a chats worth social worker that the LA social workers are nothing but jokes and only in it for the money..... They took away a 15 from the only person he had that he knew loves and cares for him and put him in foster care after fighting for so long for him they ripped his heart out and he ended up in a very depressed state closing himself off from the world for almost two years and finally coming out of his shell now at almost 18 already he is still very scared and emotionally unstable not knowing who he can trust and know who actually cares for him.he refuses to let anyone but me in and won't just talk to anyone. This court system beyond sucks and should be closed down.</text>

<Review>Where you have to pay at for parking are very friendly and helpful. Once you get into the courthouse, this is where the security are very rude. Ask them a question and they just look at you like your dumb or something. It is very clean in here. Love the fact that you can bring in your drinks. Other then that it is a pretty cool place.</Review>< response>

Wait times are long but, as a foster parent, I have to wonder reading these reviews why nobody mentions drugs? Drugs are what bring the vast majority of these precious children into the system. If you can't admit reading this that it is unacceptable to do drugs and care for children, then-no matter how much you love them- they aren't safe with you. A bad night of parenting should consist of letting them have cheetos or watch more than an hour of cartoons, not exposing them to drugs, violence and abuse. Children deserve to be loved and to be kept safe.<//text>

Hire your own attorney for your children and yourself if you can. Do not rely of the court appointed hacks to do the best job. They are over worked and just want to shuffle you through.< /Review>

<text>This place is full of kidnappers and liars. I've been through the system, got adopted, and once I was about to turn eighteen my adoptive family cut me off from my sisters lives. These so called "social workers" don't give a damn about the families they separate. They place kids in whatever home and I also believe they should do background checks on the potential adoptive family because some of them only care about the money and benefits, not the kids. I know not every adoptive family isn't like that, but the system is messed up and these people don't care about the lives they've ruined.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Shame on anybody who assumes this is A good place. They have never had a right to Judge any family or any situation. It's one thing to help a family, but to have a judge involved in this matter is a travesty. I want everyone who sees this, to know that God is very real & God is the ONLY Judge. THE DEVIL CHANGED THE Rules & everybody is going along with it, because we're in hell and the devil has had control. We have one creator only! & soon those who don't yet know or don't believe, will believe & will see. Don't ever feel like you're alone. Don't ever allow anyone to take your faith away. Trust in the Lord and let it go right now. If what you want is your child back and you're really love your child.... you'll be reunited soon. I promise. All you have to do is read Gods words,  live by Gods laws. God loves us all... he's heard all our cries and he heard us calling for him. I need for anyone reading this to be a little patient. Jesus' children were kidnapped and Jesus mourned two daughters and everyone watched and nobody helped. Everybody judged Jesus' parenting, when Jesus loved both daughters. I wrote a long time ago that "Every employee here will have to answer to God someday, since they act as God and intentionally break up families and tear children away from their parents all for their own funding or lack there of." It is their turn to be Judged. Jesus could've gone back home, but because of this place couldn't. Not until changes are made. Just know the 2nd coming has occurred, but remember that even Jesus didn't know when the second coming would take place, well imagine finding out after 30+ years God has chosen you. & everyone around you knew. The government, your friends and family.... you're the only that didn't know. A lot of mixed emotions, but nevertheless Jesus is also human. So give Jesus a little bit of time to process all this and if you llive by Gods word I promise that the glory is yours.

They get away with everything, using 'the best interest for the child,' in order for the public to believe that they care about kids, which ultimately leaves a parent or caregiver all alone, facing a world of discrimination, because people automatically assume, that this Court is involved due to abuse/neglect of a child, when they're the ones causing the abuse/neglect onto the child. Kids are snatched away from everything that they know & housed with strangers & never checked on. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY HAVE A BOATLOAD OF INCOMPETENT SOCIAL WORKERS, WHO TAKE UNLAWFUL ACTIONS, WHEN PROCEEDING & THIS IS WHAT THE COURT RELIES ON. ONCE THE COURT SEES THAT THEIR DECISION, WAS UNJUST, DUE TO A SOCIAL WORKER'S LACK OF DUE DILLIGENCE, THE COURT PERMANENTLY SEPARATES THE CHILD FROM THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY LOVE THE CHILD... THEY WILL EVEN GO TO EXTREME MEASURES TO GET A FAMILY MEMBER INVOLVED TO VOUCH FOR THE COURT...A FAMILY MEMBER, WHO HAS SOMEHOW ABUSED OR ABANDONED THE CHILD IN THE PAST... THIS IS WHO THEY USE AS THEIR CASE IN CHIEF IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR CASE APPEAR TO BE PROPER.

I HAVE MY BACHELOR'S IN SOCIOLOGY AND I HAVE FULL CUSTODY OF MY TWO KIDS, BUT IT WASN'T EASY. I WAS a single mother for 11 years! SOCIAL WORKER SANDY PEREZ UNLAWFULLY TOOK POSSESSION OF MY KIDS, WITHOUT a Police or school complaint against me. Social worker Olga Mendoza, who investigated an erroneous confidential verbal abuse complaint, was supposed to close my case after I gave her the names of the "anonymous," callers. However when Perez ran my name while I was in the hospital, the complaint that Mendoza was supposed to close, showed pending.  Perez reinvestigated the entire matter and took my kids to a foster home, citing I suffer from homicidal/ suicidal ideation and she stated a police report was pending. She wasn't even supposed to submit a petition without a police report... the Judge sent my two daughters ages 11 & 8 with the absent parent in another state. When the Judge found out there was no police report and even more that there was a paramedic report from the same day clearing me of homicidal/suicidal ideation.< /text>

They take your honestly and turn it upside down just to make sure they have a job to go to. All money aint good money as the saying goes. These people really must not care about the value and love that surrounds parents and children. They claim that they are here to help reunited family and or keep family with family. All lies. A true honest setback and thats all they need to turn the rest of your world upside down. All I can do is continue praying that someone sees this corruption and helps us. All I want is my kids to be together like they should. And be raised like any other child. Dont break up my family to keep your paychecks rolling. God dont like ugly. And they have nerve to judge me. Im fighting for my kids and I will never stop until they are all 3 together with my family, not with a foster family with numerous other foster kids. I put my kids life and future in my Lords hands and know he will do right by them. Release them from this so called System. Free my 3 kids.

The location is on a hill with 1 way in off of Ramona.  You have to pay for parking;  pay twice if your case gets put on after lunch. At peak times,  elevators are packed and u have to wait. Due to the nature of the place,  you have to wait in large open areas with everyone else in front of your courtroom.  It's very loud and the crowd is predominantly people having a bad day. No communication on what or when your case will be handled<//review>

<Review>I have had my son since he was 2 and have been raising him until 11 1/2 years old when I was falsely arrested and kept in jail for a year. I was acquitted in jury trial on all charges, but my kid is still in foster care. These people are trying to make me do all kinds of stuff as if I was the one that did something wrong. I did everything that they are asking to gain full custody of my son years ago. Of course my kid is traumatized by everything, doesnt understand why he is not back with me, and now is rebelling with bad grades and behavior. He has always been a good student, very respectful kid and happy. Now my son is full of anger, and DCFS making my kid into another statistic. It's tragic and these workers do lie, or don't put everything in their reports to the courts. Good thing I document everything , but dealing with them you never know. Best wishes to anyone struggling with them.<//Review>< userid>

This place loves to take kids away. Put them in foster homes. They make up false allegations with "no proof" make u do a bunch of classes ruin kids lives. Pathetic lawyers and Judges that know nothing about u or ur childs life yet makes situations even worst. Billion dollar funding where kids go to foster home after foster home where they get beat and sexually abused and social services put kids in this situation. Yeah this place needs to be shut down!<//text>

They don't bother looking into what recommendations were sent in by your social worker or child's school and therapist. They make judgement calls based on crunching as many families in as they can. I'm not surprised with all the incidences that have been occurring with children dying while under a case with DCFS and the courts they work with. If you get a public defended by the name of Thomas Piccata, request a new one immediately! He will never return your calls or address any concerns.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

My name is georgina barrega I will be attending to this court on 5/7/15 at 9:30 am. I hope everything goes well ,
Ive read all the reviews and I am completely scared that something might go wrong. This is my first time attending to this court house but all I could say and hope for, is that all goes well and that this court judge that will be thanking my case makes the right decisions. I am willing to do whatever I have to do in other to not lose my children. I've made one mistake and take fully responsibility of it.   People just say things, but I believe that a judge should  make his decisions by asking for proven evidence from what a person is being accused, not by just words..</review>

They stole our precious little twins right from the Hospital because they were Micro Premies and  we did not have our own place to live yet. But it did not take long to get our own place , but our judge who is Gay, was already giving our twins to a gay couple with lots of money. We never had a chance. This court is a Sham, and makes the state millions of dollars by legally and illegally stealing  children.</Text>< user_id>

Do to the lieing Social worker she refuse to recommend placing my grandbaby in my home because I had to go over her head several times to her supervisor and she didn't like that. My grandbaby has been gone for 3 yrs now she has missed out on so much she lost a great grandmother and a great great grandmother many holidays I just want to bring her home something really needs to be done about the way this system is ran. Court room 420 is  joke and the Social worker at 8300 Vermont should not be a worker because off front she is already judging you without even getting to know you.i can't give up on my grandbaby I really would love to get her home while I'm still here.

Hate this court.  No hesitation to rip families apart, take children from mothers with no regard, causing emotional, mental distress and trauma.  They have to much power and unethical procedures to dealing with their cases.  Floors are beyond crowded, and the wait to be seen by judge can last all day.  In the court room, parents are slaughtered by county council, with encouragement of social workers  lies, false allegations and deceit from their bias reports.
This court is pathetic and their motive is money for each child.< /review>

Their is nothing to like about this system. They made my girl have a miscarriage the first day of court. You show proof the social workers lie, the court does nothing! They make you take all kinds of classes with NO time or date for completion, just progress reports. Then have the audacity to say "We're terminating reunification." I'm going to sue the HELL, out of these people!!!< /Review>

Whats difference of 18 yrs. Old.  Its alll about money and keeping most lazzy workers on payroll.  Instead of helping the children they are messing them up emotionally.  And where they are to help they dont like children that have been killed in fosters homes or with biological parents.

<rate>1<//rate><Text>My daughter had been sexually abused and used in Satanic Rituals because my ex and his wife were practicing pagans. My daughter, at the time was three yrs old and very smart for her age. She's an adult now. She reported the abuse of her neighbors, while out playing with kids in the neigborhood.   He started his abuse subtlely.  I had two kids with him. When my daughter was ten months old, he kicked in the leg and broke her leg above her knee. Upon further x-rays, my daughter had a number of breaks (ribs, wrist) that I didn't know about. I worked at nights and he looked after the kids.  My son he played with, but he never wanted a girl, but I didn't know he would hurt her or that he had pagan beliefs. I was totally unaware of paganism or the many different aspects of it or that people practiced it.  I left him after what  he did to my daughter. He got with his current wife who had kids that she had been abusing for  years. He had got a hold to the kids by picking up from my grandmother's, who was keeping them, while I settled in Los Angeles. He decided he wanted custody.  And then the abuse was reported and a social worker informed me that the vagina injuries were suspect of Satanic Ritual Abuse. My kids were taken twice from them and put in foster care. I got them out twice. There was a criminal courts trial in which they pleaded 'no contest'.  I didn't my kids near them, especially my daughter.  I moved away and they kidnapped them from New York with 'false' court custody papers that his wife made up. I found out that they lied to court and said that I was served papers, but I was never served. I didn't know where my kids were for a year. My daughter called me...secretly. She was real smart and remembered the phone number. My daughter fought hard to get away from her father because of what they were doing. They only wanted custody to repress her memories of the sexual abuse, for fear of jail. The Children's court  ignored all the allegations that the social workers said about my ex and his wife, their viciousness (my ex slashed the tires of a social worker that came over to their home), his criminal record, the pleading of 'no contest of sexual abuse', or their non compliance w/court orders. But they had the best attorney, while my kid's and my attorney said absolutely nothing during the proceedings. In fact, the attorneys laughed in court as if what was being said was not true. Commissioner Losnick was over all the proceedings and my attorney at the time, Matthew Chapman, refused to allow the sexual abuse records to presented to the court. In fact, Matthew Chapman had a nasty disposition towards me during the proceedings. I hated this attorney  because I was being railroaded and that jerk wouldn't let me say anything. It was like I was in "Twilight Zone". I wrote the court to replace him and my request was ignored. The social workers that I dealt with at the time were great! They wanted me to return to NY, have my ex/wife charged with kidnapping, but it didn't happen. The court put my kids back in their custody. I have no criminal record or addiction issues. But the emotional stress and added PTSD from this court and its unjust and cruel judgment to hurt my life was surreal. I was working in real estate in NY when this happened. My ex  had not paid me child support in years.  It's an evil ministry that's practice by 'pagans'  to destroy people thru our legal system. Once you lose custody of your kids in this system, no matter what court you go to, you cannot get your kids back because that court will always look back at this court's decision as a 'reference' point. And it was very difficult to get  my ex/wife back in court. They would not pick the registered mail or answer the door when the sheriffs come. It was a horrific ordeal for me for many years. My reputation was ruined because my church, family, friends and your 'children' will not understand why you lost if you were right. It It was as if I was lying or living some terrible secret life that kept me from getting my children.  So beware of this court...< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c59b11e3f3b9:0x4bb0891d8b7ed0b7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This system is corrupt I had my kids attorneys Rebecca Harkness trying to persuade my son into retracting his allegations in order to be able to represent him.  Also she lied to the judge saying my kids were afraid of me and advised the judge to take my kids despite that my kids wanted to come back.  And she looks at you like she is a racist.<//text>

<text>Disco Rapper you are completely wrong. It is very traumatic for a child to be yanked from a good parent. The child experiences PTSD. You need to read about it to understand what happens.</text>< pics>

This place has given my children nothing more than unfair orders and biased descisions on our lives. Courtroom 414 Commissioner M. Kading Martinez is a horrible lady and I hope for the sake of other children and their parents and families that she steps down or gets shut down from her position at this courthouse.</review>

Long waits, you may see a judge for 5 mins, since my case started 10 months ago I have been at this stupid place at least 2 times a month. This is my second time this week up here. The social workers don't follow court orders and the court visits are only 15 min and that's if they feel up to a visit whether approved or not</review>

How you doing everybody this "White Collar" criminals should be at jail, DCFS, Judges, Public Defenders, as the attorneys that, supposedly represent our children they don't care the well being of our children all they see is numbers, the solution is to file lawsuits on Federal Courts for violation of Constitutional Rights under Color of Law against the entities of the Departments and you guys are going to see the difference< /text>

If I never have to go back, it'll be too soon. This place is a circus, they make orders and force you to sign things without thorough explanation, the lawyers they assign are absolutely useless and merely there for show. My child and I have suffered more in our encounter with this system than anything they could ever accuse me of. I'm sickened and disgusted at the sheer money-hungry business disguised as children's protectors.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) In this place they are a corrupt mafia, they destroy families, and most of all they destroy children. The lawyers do not represent the interests of the parents, but rather the interests of the county. Judges are more corrupt than those in Mexico. They alter files, at will. During the time that I tried to defend my children from this corrupt mafia, it was for more than 16 years. It all started during a visit to Michoacan, Mexico during a Christmas vacation, I dispelled my 17-year-old daughter, slapping her on the voice with an open hand. Upon returning to the United States, I report him to school, and the school reported him to social workers, they came to my house and took my four children 17, 16, 11, and one 18 months old. I objected, and the next day the social worker came to my house with two policemen and they took my children, even without a court order. Which is the law. Even though my children were not in any imminent danger, as they say they were. Later, already in court, I found out what it was about since I was completely unaware of his power, and I believed that I had rights, I could not be more wrong. For 18 months that is how long the jurisdiction of this player lasts, it was the most terrifying thing in my life. During this time I was allowed to look at my two youngest children very few times, the two oldest daughters, one was already living with the lawyer who represented her mother, while she was a minor and under the supposed protection of the department. The other got pregnant while she was almost eighteen years old. And since I was paying child support, I was not allowed to look at my children. At the end of time in this place, the children gave themselves to their mother and nothing to me. The 11 at that time was 12 and decided to come and live with me, the youngest, I hardly looked at him, I had to start a trial in a family court, where I obtained custody of the one who lived with me and half the time with the other. And I stopped the maintenance since I was charged for four, which had no legal rights, since one lived with me and the two oldest, no longer lived with their mother. But since the court was informed that the lawyer was personally involved with my daughter, they took my children from me again, and again started another new trial in this corrupt court. For another year I defended myself from their false accusations. But in this court I showed them that the lawyer and my eldest daughter were not even there, since the lawyer committed capital violation by initiating a sexual relationship with my daughter while she was a minor and while she was under the supposed protection of the court. . That time they removed the lawyer and my daughter from the court and told them to leave to protect and cover up the facts. another time I started looking at my youngest son.

En este lugar son una mafia de corruptos, destrullen familias, y mas que nada destrullen ninos,  Los abogados no representan los interes de los padres, mas vien los intereses del condado.  Los Juezes son mas corruptos que los de Mexico.  Alteran archivos, a su antojo.  Durante el tiempo que intente defender a mis hijos de esta mafia de corruptos fue por mas de 16 anos.  Todo empezo durante una visita a Michoacan, Mexico durante unas vacaciones navidenas, disipline a mi hija de 17 anos, apicandole una cachetada en la voca con la mano abierta.  Al regreso a estados unidos lo reporto a la escuela, y la escuela lo reporto a los trabajadores sociales, vinieron a mi casa y se llevaron a mis cuatro hijos 17, 16, 11, y uno de 18 mesese.  Me opuse, y al dia siguiente vino a mi casa la trabajadora social con dos policias y se llevaron a mis hijos, aun sin una order de juzgado.  Lo cual es la ley.  A pesar de que mis hijos no estaban en ningun peligro inminente, como dicen que se encontraban.  Porteriormente, ya en el juzgado, se me ingormo de lo que se trataba ya que yo ignoraba por competo de su poder, y yo creia que tenia derechos,  No podia estar mas equivocado.   Durante 18 mesese que es lo que dura la jurisdicion de este jugado, fue lo mas aterrador de mi vida.  Durante este tiempco se me permitio mirar a mis dos hijo  menores muy pocas veces, las dos hijas mayores, una ya estava viviendo con el abojado que representaba a la mama, minetras era menor de edad y bajo la supuesta protecion del departamento. La otra salio enbarazada mientras casi cumplia sus diez y ocho anos.  Y a pezar de estar pagando manuntencion no se me permia mirar a mis hijos.  Al terminar el tiempo en este lugar, los hijos se le entregaron a la madre y a mi nada.  El de 11 para ese tiempo tenia 12 y decidio venirse a vivir conmigo, el mas pequeno, casi no lo miraba,  Tuve que iniciar un juicio en una corte familiar, donde obtuve custodia del que vivia conmigo y la mitad de tiempo con el otro.  Y pare la manuntecion ya que se me cobraba por cuatro, los cuales no tenian nungun derecho legas, ya que una viva conmigo e las dos mayores , ya no vivian con su madre. Pero como se le informo a la corte de que el abogado estaba involucrado personalmente con mi hija, me volvieron a quitar a mis hijos, y otra vez iniciaron otro nuevo juicio en este jusgado corrupto.  pro otro ano me defendi de sus falsas acusaciones.  Pero en esta corte les demostre que el abogado y mi hija mayor no devian esta siquiera ahi, ya que el abogado avia cometido vilacion capital al iniciar una relacion sexual con mi hija mientras era menor de edad y mientras estaba bajo la supuesta protecion de la corte.    esa vez scaron al abogado y a mi hija del juzgado y les dijeron que se fueran para proteger y encubrir los echos.   otra ves empeze a mirar a mi hijo el menor.< /text>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) THIS IS A PLACE WHERE IT KILLS HOPES, ILLUSIONS, DESTROYING FAMILIES WHERE IT DOESN'T REAL INTEREST TO THEMSELVES FEELING OF OUR CHILDREN. MY SON IS ESCAPED TO THE WORKER, AND UNTIL NOW NOTHING ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IS ALREADY MORE THAN ONE YEAR OF THIS. MY DAUGHTERS THE LITTLE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE CRIANSA'S PARENTS TO ADOPT THEM. BUT I DON'T REMAIN FORWARD I WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING. AND STILL THE WORKER SAYS THAT HE WILL NEVER GET BACK TO ME, THAT I DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING I FOLLOW, BECAUSE FOR ME THE LAST WORD HAS GOD GOD OUR FATHER.

<Text>First time eater as I went in with a co-worker who had been here before. I ordered an Ortega burger and fries. This is not a fast food place and your order will take a few minutes for it to cook, but it is worth the short wait. Both Burger and fries were very good. It's hard to find crinkle french fries anywhere these days, but this place had them and I enjoyed them. As for the hamburger it was worthy of a billboard picture. And that's the good news.

The bad news is this was an expensive lunch. For the aforementioned items plus an iced tea the bill ran me $15 plus. That's almost exactly what Five Guys had charged me for basically the same thing. As good as my lunch was, I think it could have been a little bit cheaper. And I would be remissed not to point out that the inside dining area was filled with smoke from the kitchen and it was actually difficult to breathe in there. Fortunately it was a nice day and we were able to eat outside.

Overall I'd say this place is not a bad choice for a good lunch, but due to its prices I recommend you do it infrequently.

Edited on 4/10/19 because I was rushed and didn't proofread my previous posting. Hopefully that first paragraph wasn't too off-putting.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Very Friendly staff but their food seems to be frozen,  Their BBQ  ribs seem like they come from a  frozen package, the sauce is a thick tomato paste and all you taste is the tomato  and the french fries were frozen. Very poor quality BBQ but still I'm giving it three stars because the service is great<//text>

<Text>Not worth the money.  Small portion size for the cost. Literally a small container for meat and a little cup you put guacamole in for potatoes salad... Crazy. Only reason I'm giving them to stars is it's halfway decent BBQ.  Garlic pesto fries were decent as well.</Text><Time>1583375314295</Time><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNquAQYfCEspUCohVGtjs8M_k-uQzhGdwL8ilR-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Rating>

<review>Decent burgers, fries, and shakes. No frills decor, but pretty expensive. Large basket of seasoned fries seemed surprisingly small. Wide variety of choices for bun. The sourdough was kind of interesting. I will probably not go back, but that is at least partly because the place is geographically inconvenient.<//review>< pictures>

<review>Cons:The burger was a overdone for my taste (they didn't ask how I like it prepared)  They keep the soda machine out of customer reach so perhaps have a problem with refills, I don't know. Tables were tight and a bit wobbly. Pros: Overall menu had a lot of options, crinkle cut fries were good. Parking lot was adequate. Counter staff was friendly. Assume I caught them on an off day, would try it again and ask for medium rare instead of well done.</review>< Rating>

Fiori's has THE best pastrami sandwich in the area. So many other places serve pastrami that is dry. Not here. I haven't had a burger or other sandwich, and there is a lot to choose from, that wasn't tasty and done the way I wanted it. Also, if you like classic restored cars this is the place to be.</text>

I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger and Chili Cheese Fries.   I got no bacon on the burger and no cheese on the chili cheese fries.  The chili was bland and didn't seem like seasoning was used.  I think I'm done with this place.  In the future I will go down the road to Carmen's Burger Bar.<//Review>

<Review>It's a hole in the wall of a burger joint that we almost missed buy it was sooo worth it yo find it! The burgers were huge, juicy, and delicious! The garlic pesto fries were surprisingly tasty and the pineapple milkshakes were so yummy! It's a small space with a handful of tables inside and picnic tables outside so large groups are tough but we made it work. If I'm ever in that area again, I'd definitely go back.< /Review>< rating>

Waiting over 25 minutes for a burger when it's not very busy is pretty unacceptable and while we were warned...we didnt have time to go to another place before our show at the Wells Fargo Center. Food was good. SF Mint shake was better but the time it took which was closer to 30 mins was unacceptable and I didn't understand.<//Review>

Great Burgers,  but you have to try a wicked whip.  Better than a milkshake and lots of flavors.</Text>

I ordered a Jack & Avocado Burger with no onion, no sauce, and no bun.  It came with onions.  I took it back and handed it to an elderly woman behind the counter.  Within 2 minutes it was returned to me with no visible onions, but it still smelled of onion.  I couldn't eat it.</review>

<text>The burgers at Fiori's (as this burger place is now called) are classic drive-in fare: cooked to perfection on a flat-top grill, assembled to order with quality fresh garnishes, served with classic thick-cut fries and milk-shakes as desired. What lifts them above the franchise chain product is the creativity of the menu. We.like to go on Fridays when the place is surrounded by classic cars...< /text><GmapID>0x808438cd662ff009:0xd4c75bd6b19dbaf7</GmapID><UserId.>106867346209678710884</UserId.></record>

Pretty good basic buggers, but on the pricey side. $10+ for a drink and burger, no fries.</text>

< Review>
Called BUNS & Burgers for a reason

Buns are huge; if the burgers are actually 1/3 lb, they don't look it, as there is so much bread. Not juicy (I watched the cook flattening the burgers with the spatula, which squeezes out the juices). Asked for one w/o onions, but they just changed it from onion rings to fried onions.  Weird. All in all, I  won't be returning.</Review>

The food was pretty good! I really enjoyed it. I think what really stood out though was their coffee. The breakfast burrito that we ordered (Machaca) came with a pretty bland presentation, but made up for it in taste. Eggs were very good, a little too buttery though. We also ordered the wheat pancakes, which were very good!<//Text>

Food tasted great. I had steak street tacos + a Verde shrimp taco.

<Text>This place barely gets one star. One time my son found a long black hair in his food which was disgusting. We both throw the food away. I gave then another chance again and the food I picked up was a total mess as they have thrown the left over from other customers plate into that bowel.  the steak looked liked little dried up pieces as it has been sitting out there for weeks and did not even look like meat. I've never seen anything like this ever before. On top of that when I reported the food was bad, the manager, Claudia, insisted for me to get store credit and give them another chance. Well, once I convinced myself to actually do it and called she said she does not remember the conversation at all. This is a woman I spoke on the phone with and told her I was trying to report it so they can fix their food services and have no intention to get my money back or any credits. She insisted on giving me store credit and said by doing that it makes her feel better. And now she got amnesia and do not remember the conversation from few days ago. I as a food critique only give one chance to any place if the first impression is good they get my business but for some reason I gave their place too many chances and they still came out performing poorly. I would not feed my dog with that food.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>Another fast-casual Americanized taco joint this one focused particularly on seafood with a surprisingly pretty good selection of creature. Pictured is the classic fish taco especial it's a breaded Pollock deep fried and what makes it special is the addition of onions guacamole and cheese. They do have a salsa bar and I think they have beer, he said machines also dispense sparkling water which I love. Tacos come with chips and refried beans if you order them as a plate.< /Text>< GmapID>

I've been a Rubio's fan since Ralph Rubio opened in San Diego.  Unfortunately he extended his reach to Ventura and things fell apart.  When they've got someone in the kitchen who cares they are wonderful.  But today sadly they were not.
The prepare each dish to order and are not fast.  So relax and sit outside on the patio and listen to the speaker blare out instructions in English and Spanish on a 20 second loop  to wait outside.  That's coming from their Chinese neighbor.
The staff is the typical unmanaged sort that doesn't like their job and takes it out on customers.  No need lady to slam the soda bottle down on the counter so it fizzes all over me when I open it.  And no need to throw the salsa menu at me either.
If you are sitting outside waiting for your order they might come to the door and yell out your name but are just as likely to wait until you come back inside to pick it up.
Sorry Ralph.  Get some management into this store. Train your people on customer service and your cooks on consistency.<//review>

seafood... so good. Great place to relax, people watch, eat good food or all the above.  It has a great feel to it. Ambience reminds me of San Diego's scene.<//text>

We always LOVED Rubios-- but not anymore.
Something is terribly wrong--not only was there was less food-- it was tasteless!  The churros were so bad that I don't ever want to eat another churro as long as I live--for fear it will taste like the ones we had.

Very very sad.<//Text>

<Text>Pretty yummy food and the customer service is very good. I just downloaded their app and didn't know how to use it. The cashier was gracious enough to help me. Customer service is more valuable today as ever because of there being so much negativity out there so whenever someone is nice to me, I want to make sure to write about it.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Everything here was awesome! The food, service, appetizer... Everything. It was 3 of us and we shared the shrimp with sausage grit cake app (it was called something like that) and it was too good. I ordered the pork with greens and it was so tender and flavorful; the other food I tasted was great too. We sat us stairs which gave a great view. I'd definitely return when I'm in the area!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

They have a small salsa bar with four salsas  lemons, limes, onion and cilantro and cured jalapeños. I found the chipotle salsa to be a little bland but still pretty good. They have more seafood on the menu than a lot of Mexican places I've been to, but I'm not much into mixing seafood with my Mexican food so I ended up getting the street tacos which came with chips and refried beans. Monica, the cashier was very friendly and helpful. There's no service to comment on as this is a type of place where you order at the counter and take a seat. Overall it's not bad and reasonably priced.. $20 fed two of us. We will probably be back if we get the chance.</text>< response>

Other than the guy behind the knife and ammo counter, this store doesn't really offer as much assistance as they could. Rather, go anywhere near the center of any isle and their on you like glue. I've spent a LOT of money there the last several months,yet there's and air about the store that screams " every person through the door is suspect". Though to be fair, alot of retail stores have become sterile and bland and emphasis security,which is great, but you can't even be leasure in your shopping to even mule over your decision without an employee hawking over you or close by ready to jump in to help you get your item and go.<//review>

< Review>
Great place to shop. I always find what I'm looking for plus more. I went there last night and bought a few items and one of the young ladies carried my stuff to my car for me. I always have a great experience at Big 5< /Review>

This store is great, I love it.
But just so you know the location has moved into the actual strip mall near Harbor Freight. The same parking lot.
Thanks< /Review>

It's a nice store with a huge variety of Sporting Goods. The prices are not bad and the fact that they have sales in constant coupons I get to my email is awesome. The people are nice and always helpful<//Review>

An excellent experience. The sales person was very helpful. I bought a shooting scope for casual Star and planet gazing and they pulled them down for me to examine, and spent some time explaining differences, etc. Very helpful for a $50 sale.</Text>

When I walk into this business, I am always greeted with a welcoming comment and a smile. I usually don't have to look for a sales clerk because the cashier knows where everything is. A while back I purchased my fishing license there. The cashier handled the entire transaction and was very knowledgeable about laws, etc. Great training in this store...and hiring.<//Text>

<Text>We just went toConcordnlocation, and have a great experience with the employees, even the manager was so professional.And we went to pick our older son to buy boots and snow staff at the Antioch location on sommerville and employees here are so not well trained, even the female manger, she was no help, no customer service skills at all, make us feel like they almost don't want us there. So upset that they are not well trained on customer service.< /Text>< resp>

Went into Big 5 to purchase a shotgun. Manager came to assist me and then she walked off and never returned. She went to the cash register and started to assist other customers. My money should have been just as good as anyone else's.<//review>

I went in right after they opened to pick up some cheap work shoes. Despite being the only customer in the store (with 3 employees present), I still had to go track one of them down to help me with getting the proper size from the back room. They were nice, but not very attentive.< /Text>

Went for fishing license for salmon fishing young girl said she was manager and was trying to sell me punch card and enhancement stamp for 12 dollars more.  Other manager came and explain that's only for inland and lake not ocean fishing.  She was pissed that she was wrong in front of two coworkers plus her manager.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I agree, the staff at this store are the rudest "employees" I ever dealt with. I literally just picked something quick cause the woman was giving off a vibe like I was annoying and wasting her time. Then I got accused of shoplifting by the grotesque he she with the braid simply because I was looking at something then I guess it wasn't there 10 minutes later. So I was forced to pay for it or be "banned" oh my this was ridiculous! So the few days later when i went back to return (which they kept constantly lying that only a store manager could return it. So after two days of lies I finally just went to Concord where that store manager said that wasn't true!) what I bought they told me they found it literally under the display stand. So ridiculous. Don't go to this store, the Big5 off Clayton are actual human beings!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808559bfc5951a3b:0x1280dcc0ca612b74</gmapID></record>

At first was gonna order 3lbs of shrimp in a bag with garlic butter, corn & potatoes ended up settling for 2lbs shrimp and it was more than enough. Ordered the peeled shrimp and glad I did after seeing the table next to us struggle with the unpeeled shrimp. Will be back again because they were out of lobster and that is the only seafood I regularly eat but decided to try the shrimp & it was good so maybe next time I'll try crab legs with the lobster or one of their sampler options to try a variety :)</review>

Pretty good, not better than boiling crab.
Order online, make sure you have your ID & the card you used to purchase it when picking up. They’re a little over priced. During the pandemic, they started serving smaller crab legs & shrimp and the sauce tastes different . I’m happy they corrected that. Staff is typically friendly. Parking is ok.</text>

<Text>I will never show up or recommend this place to anyone again.
I have eaten here one too many times at this point.
This is my 3rd visit to this place.
Servers are attitudinal, the management will not entertain a question and it involved positive feedback, not a complaint.
They do not have signage explaining they don’t open the front door.
They make you wait at a back door to enter where it’s disgusting.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<rating>1</rating><review>So my rating is solely based on my experience with the customer service.
I was very disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try this restaurant out because the food does look delicious from the pictures.
My friend called here at 9pm asking if we could reserve a table for 2 and that we were 13 min away. The gentleman (Jay) on the phone told us we should be fine as long as we get there before 9:30pm because there kitchen closes at 9:30pm (restaurant closes at 10pm). We parked right in front of the restaurant, walked to the front door only to be told we have to enter through the back door. This isn't a far walk but you do have to walk past other store fronts and a gas station and walk down an alley way just to enter through the back door. I understand each restaurant has different ways of operating because of COVID and really do respect and appreciate that. I do however think it's a little ridiculous to send your customers through a maze just to dine in. Parking is hard to find in that area and then to find out you have to enter from a different location just added to us trying to rush to make sure we can get in before 9:30pm. When we got to the back of the restaurant (9:20pm) there were 2 parties ahead of us and we were told we may or may not get seated because they were at full capacity and the kitchen closes at 9:30pm. We were told it looked like we may get seated since customers were finishing up so my friend and I decided to wait. It's 9:35pm and we were told we would not be getting seated since they were at full capacity and it was past 9:30pm. At this point we spoke to the manager and she apologized and mentioned they were at full capacity and that they are still trying to get things figured out because of COVID.
My only disappointment in all of this is telling your customers that as long as they show up before 9:30pm they will get seated. As a business, stick to your word with your customers. Especially new customers. I'm all about service and when I see staff/waiters/restaurant owners going above and beyond for me, I enjoy the food that much more and am willing to leave the best reviews, best tips and telling friends and family about a new spot I tried.
Stick to your word as a company. There was another couple that also showed up 5 min after us that wanted to dine in and left very disappointed and angry because they were told the same thing (show up before 9:30).
It would have been very nice if the manger was super apologetic and gave us some type of incentive to make us want to come back. But that whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth and now I don't even want to try their food.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Extremely disappointed! Ordered the 1/2 lb Cajun shrimp head and tail on. Shrimp was mushy and didn’t have much of a Cajun flavor.
Who knew that you could ruin coleslaw?? Obviously this place can. Will not be ordering from hère again.</text>

Overall decent experience.  Great customer service on the phone that provided detailed instructions for arrival including having to go to the rear of the restaurant for entry.  Odd?  Yes, however it was a practice for all.  Highly recommend the Bye Bye Birdie, which was a shot flight and well worth it.  The rest of the meal was subpar.  Food came out and was lukewarm.  Spicy was anything but.  The seasoning was ok and the portion size was adequate.  I wouldn't mind trying somewhere else but this was ok.<//text>

My family ate here for the first time tonight. Absolutely disappointing. The fish, fries, and corn fritters all looked like they were cooked in old grease, and tasted like it. $18 for a plate full of disgusting. Very very poor. Never, ever returning again. If I could give zero stars I would.<//Review>

<Review>Just had the catfish dinner.  I'm shocked how thin and salty the fish was. The mac n cheese tasted like it was boxed kraft mac n cheese dressed with shredded cheese! My cousin had the cod fish dinner and had to CUT the fish with a knife. It's like the food was days old left overs that was reheated in the microwave.  I don't know what this place was like pre- COVID,  but now it's made me sick literally.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

On 4/21/2020,  I decided to do curbside pick-up during the quarantine. I was a little skeptical but I was hungry. Got some Snow Crab Legs with sausage and potatoes along with an Adios from the drink menu...Amazing!! The food was excellent and the drink was actually strong! This was a very satisfying dinner. I will be back for sure for the Catfish Basket and some Gumbo!!</text>

The food OMG!! the food is amazing, the flavor and how messy is is what makes the whole experience unique.
This is one of my favorite places in the Valley for sea food. They know what they are doing.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c297cf04f94e8f:0xf15f207b32a156b2</Gmap_id>< userid>

Lovely food. Very comforting. I enjoyed the personal TVs per booth. Service was excellent. Very classy touch using the big bowl instead of bags like other seafood restaurants. They definitely don't hold back on the alcohol drinks either which is a super plus</text>

<Review>Food Great. Service was the Worst!! Had to keep asking the waiter for butter, bread with our meals, tartar sauce .. Never got them until we were finished with our meal. Asked repeatedly, was told he was bringing them. Even got up and asked the kitchen and Still never got what we asked for. I've never had such bad service at this restaurant before,  but it's been about a year since I've been there. The staff was the worst. Nice but not on the ball. Our waiter either needs training how to handle parties of 10 or needs to find a different profession. Even the other wait staff, lame.</Review><Response>None<//Response>< rating>

This place is wonderful.  What a find.  Follow these steps:  Go between 5:00 and 7:00 Mon. through Thurs for happy hour.  Then you have a great menu at reasonable prices for Caesar salad, etc.  My favorite is not on this menu however. It is not too pricey.  A cup is big enough for dinner.  It is the best Gumbo in the valley.  Spicy with shrimp and muscles, calamari,  crab claws and chicken and sausage.  You can get a scoop or rice or not. I could eat it every night!< /Review>

Awesome atmosphere and really good seafood. Full bar and plenty of seating. The clam strips were nothing special, but still good ($5 during happy hour). The snow crab legs were perfectly prepared and the garlic flavoring was excellent. Pricing was about what you would expect and worth every penny. I will be back.< /review>

If you like being served food in large plastic bags (unlike the buckets you would assume the food would come in) maybe this place is for you? If you like paying for over boiled corn and sub par boiled potatoes (not included with a bag of seafood) maybe this place is for you? If you like waiting 30 min to get your check brought to you maybe this place is for you? My stomach hurts from earlier today. For $100 I could have gone elsewhere and tasted higher quality dishes. Disappointing.<//Review>

<review>Went here last night with my girlfriend for her birthday. Excellent! Cocktails were tasty and the servers were so polite and caring. They really went all out for us. Would recommend to anyone looking for great seafood in the valley. It's a fun night out, and it can get a little pricey, but I think it's worth it.< /review>< pictures>

This was actually the place where I had my first experience where I tried oysters and crab legs. The crab legs were delicious, the oysters, well let's just say I'm not a fan of those. I really enjoyed the shrimp as well. The seasoning was great. The waitress was also very attentive and accommodating. I will be back here.</review>

Scrumptious! Great seasoned shrimp in garlicky spicy sauce. Beautiful bread baguettes to soak up that sauce. Chicken wings are served piping hot (unlike other places). Coronado beer is a perfect complement. Other fun drink selections. Happy place< /text>

We thought we'd stop by and try this place, since anything similar to The Boiling Crab can't be a mistake. We were very disappointed. We ordered the shrimp and crab and the sauce had too much oil and was tasteless. The fried oysters were delicious. They offer a larger variety of shell fish, fish, and they serve gumbo. Self parking is behind the building. Service was fast and friendly.<//Text>

<text>I couldn't eat here due to the strong smell of Asian , seafood and garlic. I love seafood and I love garlic but this place must not have a ventilation system or something? My friends who did eat said the food was good? NOTE- not a date place! Again Not A Date place. Everything you order is in a bag of sauce (you choose the sauce you want) clam bake style. You are given a bib but you need a wet suit.

Meh... The service was pleasant, but nothing extraordinary. The food was ok, yet I had way better seafood for similar pricing before. Offering some of the wet napkins like the ones they offer at Gyu-Kaku after such a messy dinner instead of those semi moist towelettes that are packed in tiny little squares would also be a better approach.< /review>

Visited for lunch on my way home from work. Found that they have been open for just 7 months and they had a very high quality service! the server was very informative letting me know what to get and what people like the most, and the suggestions on portion size to order . everything is sold by the LBS and with a sauce of your choice. I picked garlic butter and surprisingly i was able to finish everything.

New place and not crowded, I highly recommend visiting and trying out the food</Text>

<text>The seafood here is pretty awesome. I didn't care that much about the mussels, but the shrimp and clams were pretty spot on, with delicious cajun sauce and the potatoes, corn, and sausages that come in it. Even their baked bread was pretty good too. I would highly recommend this place. A fun place to eat.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

We really enjoyed this spot. We decided to skip our regular spot and try this one. It was a great decision. The atmosphere was fun with great music. They have a bar area and a regular sitting area which has individual TV service in each booth(great for football season).

There was no line, so we waited about 7 minutes. The host was friendly and welcoming. Our waitress was awesome and ready to provide great service. And she did that!

A full bar is such a plus. Didn't care for my drink too much, but my husband selected it so I'll just blame him..lol.

The food. Seasoning was on point. We ordered the sampler deal, extra side of 1lb of shrimp, calamari and wings. The seafood with the cajun mixed seasoning delicious. Calamari I loved it,  but my daughter liked the other spot better,  the wings were cooked to hard. The seasoning on them were good, but I don't like to fight with my food. Also the spice level was ok. There spicy is not spicy. I guess when I do stop in again I'll try the omg spice level. Maybe that will be the level of hot we like.

Overall we do like the spot and will come back. Still stuck on our original spot since we have been there since opening, but it's good to know i have another option close by.< /review>

I eat here a lot. At least once a month. I haven't been to Boiling Crab, but my girlfriend prefers Crabby Crab's sauces. Plus, I've never had to wait long for a table. I generally order a pound of Alaskan Crab, Green Lipped Mussels, and Cajun sausage. Used to order clams, but they came out sandy once, which is to be somewhat expected on occasion. I'm not even a seafood lover and I looooove this place.< /Review>

Incredible food, great staff, fun way to eat the seafood and not too bad prices. Our server was clearly having a rough night with his manager but was nice, professional and patient when answering all of our questions and was attentive to our needs for the full time of our visit.
The bar and the tables have the same experience, so if there is a wait for the tables just go sit at the bar!< /review>

Horrible... I took my girlfriend and my mother, who turned sixty here to tryout. What we got was: uncooked lobster, no service, and false advertising.
My mother requested the "crab" to be cracked and cleaned as per what the menu says. The waiter is given back the crab which was not cracked and cleaned like the way my mother had requested. Then the waiter returns with the same crab and isn't cracked or cleaned.
No waiters or waitresses came to pass. They were all chatting it up with each other and hitting on one another at the bar instead of doing their jobs.
The lobster was "chewy" and tasted bland. My girlfriend explained to me the exact same statement. Quote: "my stomach hurts and is making disturbing sounds." I explained "my stomach is feeling uneasy too." At which point we were given the check and left. I will not return to this "establishment" ever again for the foreseeable future.</Text>

Quite possibly the best seafood I've ever had in my life! I would give this place six stars if I could! Very friendly staff, excellent fresh seafood and lightning fast service. The only downfall is that it gets crowded sometimes but other than that it's one of the best places I've been to In Town!<//review>

Crab boils are above my budget, but the catch of the day plates are filling, and on Father's day, less than 16 dollars. The ahi was nicely grilled with a savory rub, I wished it was bigger. Read the menu carefully. Some items, like my wife's fried oysters, are a la carte. As we were running late, I appreciated the later closing, 10 pm on a Sunday.< /Text>

The happy hour is amazing! You HAVE to try the Chowder Fries. Their bread is worth the $4. Especially if you dip it in their fresh garlic butter.</review>

<Text>Food was delicious, the service needs a little work. We had a young kid who forgot about us as soon as another family came in and waited 25 minutes to pay it check. Also needed refills on our drinks and waited about 20 minutes for that to happen. I will go back for the food though.</Text><username>Nathreen Bonnet< /username>< rate>

When I have a taste for seafood,in particular, crab, this is the first place that comes to mind. Never really disappointing, sometimes the food gets overcooked (last night I had mahi mahi and it was definitely overdone). Also, sometimes the staff has difficulty with  exactly what sides come with the meal. Consequently, when ordering take-out, I sometimes over-order. Note, though, that I still give this place a 4 🌟 rating! This experience is beat shared with family and friends.< /review>

Good place for seafood. My only complaint about places like this is the method of eating the food, ie, from out of a bag and with your hands. Otherwise, the food is good and my in laws liked it.< /text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>The Crabby Crab could be decent, yet the service is absolutely horrendous at times.  In my reviews this usually offsets almost any of the food's taste, as I could make the food myself and bypass the bad service.

When we first walked in, we noticed that the young service girl at the door does not know whether she is supposed to be helping the kitchen or the big party tables (to try to cash in on tips).  She is not a waitress, so I am not sure where the discrepancy came in;  she didn't help out with any other tables and the guys from the back deliver food and clean up the table at the end sooooo... that brings us to case #2.

Our starting waiter did not look like he wanted to be there that day.  We had our appetizers before our drinks because he forgot them ... a negative mark in the restaurant industry.  He even dropped off our check at the end (after we started being served by another waiter) and told us he had to go move his car ... before not coming back to get the check.  Even on our way out, the original waiter was hiding in the kitchen instead of getting our tab.  I tipped the other waiter with glasses who was absolutely great, who noticed the bad service towards the end and stepped up.  I wish I could tip the guy who brought our food out too;  he was very punctual with bringing our order and always had a smile on his face.

As stated above, we ordered two mixed drinks.  Standard watered down drinks that I do not remember: one had blue curacao and the other coconut.  They did not warrant a second round.

The fried oysters were fried somewhat hard and had a cheap sweet and sour sauce paired with them ... truthfully, this should come with a remoulade or tartar sauce.

The crab cakes were fried to a nice consistency and the insides were moist.  Good job here and the salad on the side gives you something to eat with it;  yet, again, a tartar sauce or Thousand Island-based sauce would be a nice pairing - as squeezing lemon only takes it so far.

They were out of the snow crab and lobster when we got there, so we had to deal with king crab - since dungeness takes too much work for me and they charge $30/pound for something I will mostly throw away.  King crab tastes just like snow crab after seasoning, in my opinion;  however, trying to get into king crab is a whole different beast.  I dealt with it, but not what I expected to do that day;  it reduced the amount of pounds I ordered to one since I can't stand the spikiness.  And let's be honest, $35 a pound is a limiting factor too.

The shrimp were cooked nicely but the Crabby Way flavor did not impart to the meat well - as they were headed (with two or three being mushy towards the head part of the bodies).  I would suggest having the heads taken off, but that is my preference.

Since I base most of my reviews off of service, you can just go to the place and hope that your experience is different.  Service is atrocious at times,  they were out of the things they sell the most of (which is also a negative in the restaurant industry for something you 'specialize' in), prices are too high for the location (Van Nuys is LA ... but not upscale LA), and the food that you're getting is par for the course for what I expect a decent crab place should serve (not mind-blowingly good, but cooked well).

The waiter with glasses pretty much is the one you want.  If he had been our waiter from the beginning (and possibly worked the door), this rating may have been higher.  Make sure to ask for him and tip him, if you go.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>My Favorite place to go with or without the family.  I like the crab legs with the crabby house seasoning, mild and a malibu bay breeze.  They don't have much for happy hour but the food is so good, who cares about the happy hour!  I try to visit at least 2-3 times a month!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Food was good, but a little pricey considering everything, including bread is a-la-carte, and literally served on paper table cloths and eaten with your fingers. Really messy...not recommended for a first date, but family and friends would enjoy it.< /review>< pics>

Had awful waitress that didn't even give us specials for the day. Charged us for basket of hush puppies whereas the three tables next to us received them upon sitting down!  Manager did yet seem to be worried about it when reported it to him.</Review>

<review>Manager was rude, the manager admitted they advertising is wrong and all she could do was apologize got rude when I asked to speak to her boss.  they advertise a special that does not specify dine in only, even called over the phone about it, drove 30 minutes to grab the order to be told the special doesn't apply for to go orders.  Nobody cared - WILL NEVER COME BACK<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) One pound of unpeeled shrimp turned out to be 6 shrimp and 7 heads, presented in a plastic bag plus a pair of parents and a split cob per half, the taste is good, especially if it tastes spicy, I would not repeat or try another dish since what the other tables come did not impress me either.

(Original)
Una libra de camarones sin pelar resultó ser 6 camarones y 7 cabezas, presentado en una bolsa de plástico más un par de papás y una mazorca partida por mitad, el sabor está bien, especialmente si le.gusta picante, no repetiria ni intentaría otro plato ya que lo que vienen las otras mesas no me impresionó tampoco.</review>
