I thank her for her time and patience.
They are also fast and efficient.
Although I wasn’t helped by the other two ladies I wish I had those names, those interactions with their customers were also fast and friendly. I will frequent her again.</text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Amazing customer service from Stephanie and Jesus! They went above and beyond my expectations, and I will definitely be coming back here if I need to cash a check. Stephanie was very helpful in explaining the process for check cashing as a first-time customer. I asked about reloading a debit card, and although they couldn't reload the kind I had, she did explain they offer their own. Jesus was kind enough to LOOK UP the different places I could reload my debit card, and even provided a location that was literally down the street from their address. He didn't have to, as he was doing his own work, but again - above and beyond all expectations! At the end of my transaction, Stephanie explained the other services Money Mart has to offer, and she did it all with a smile...true, old school customer service, which is now a lost art, unfortunately. Kudos guys! Keep up the amazing work 😀</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I came by yesterday to pick up a money transfer from overseas, upon my arrival at this location there customer service person told me that western union service was already unavailable because it was 20 minutes before closing and the system already automatically shutdowns and was told to come back the next day.
I came back this morning, i arrived about 10 minutes early, at exactly 9 am opening time i tried to open the order however i felt it was still locked so i waited, about 9:04 i tried it again and it opened so i figured that maybe it has an automatic locking and opening system, anyway i was so disappointed because there customer service (Dominyk) thats what his name shown on his badge said they were not allowed to go outside and inform me that the door was already open but he already saw me outside standing and never tried to signal me that i could come in or maybe waive to me since i was looking at his direction he just left me waiting, when i confronted him thats when he said that he could not come out to inform me that in which i totally understand becuase of safety, what bothers me he just didnt care that someone outside waiting already, then when i was going to remit the money that was sent to me he told me that they do not have enough money for my remittance, now my question is if you cannot provide that kind of service dont do business, imagine you are a check cashing place, a payday advance loan, western union, and many more products but yet you dont have that kind of funds to remit? I will keep on posting to social media and BBB, i feel so disapppointed with them, had to come back twice with no results, bad customer service, i will never go back or even recommend them.</Review>

<Review>I tried to use pump #8 but when I tried to use my credit card the screen said “ go see cashier “. I proceeded to go inside and pay with cash. My bank contacted me shortly after to let me know a transaction of $125 had been declined because it was a suspicious purchase. Thankfully they blocked the transaction. I called shell to let them know and the guy who answered said “ he already went out there to check & he does it every day”, which I’m doubtful of.</Review><Time>1590690061842</Time><pics>None< /pics>< user_id>

These guys are outstanding I came in when they weren't open yet but they still service my truck. I recently personally did my brakes calibers and rotors and could not bleed my brakes. So came in to have a brake fluid flush. The technician was good and informed of the whole process. They made me feel comfortable with the service that they performed</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>The team was fantastic. They were professional and courteous from the moment I walked in the door.  I didn’t have an appointment and they were able to immediately get my car back, estimated that it might take until the next day but were able to turn around my car with all the repairs day of. I received a call once it was completed and was able to pick my car back up that evening. Great customer service and fantastic work. I’d highly recommend them!</Text></record>

< Review>
Have taken our company trucks here for tires and alignment and couldn't be happier with the service we receive. These guys have been here forever and are real pro's - they do what they say and charge a fair price for it.  Very reliable and work is complete when they promised. would recommend to anybody looking for a reliable company with no drama or pressure to do unneeded repairs.<//Review>

Great place I would definitely recommend for tires.
I would have given them five star review but I had to wait for a while when picking up my truck they only had one gentleman Alex at the front desk.

Who was answering multiple incoming calls, greeting customers, taking payments for services. He was great very knowledgeable courteous and kept his cool under pressure especially with the two customers who had a million questions and were bartering to lower the prices with out an appointment I booked my appointment over a week in advance to be able to drop off and pick up with time to get to work.

Alex definitely needed assistance at least answering phones I did hear a female voice in an office with dark glass finally answer a single call only after lines were going crazy and multiple customers in lobby.

Even with all that I would return in the feature for services location is convenient really close to my home.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I've been using Western Brake for years. They have put tires and brakes on all my cars and both my kid's cars. They always turn my car around same day and usually within an hour or two.  Their prices are competitive and their service is impeccable.  Most recently they repaired the left rear power window. I highly recommend Western Brake. I will be taking my car back to them again.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

My first time here, the service was Great! I appreciated the price and recommendations.  I went in for an oil change initially but almost faint...my 2 front tires was showing metal..I got a great deal..I felt like I was at the neighborhood mechanic...because of how comfortable I was waiting on my car..I will be going back for my rear tires and brakes..

I went back 2-3 weeks later in a nick of time so I did not have to replace my rotors..Service was quick and through while I waited...everyone there's nice professional and helpful!</review>

After bringing my car in for a dead battery, they replaced it and had me in and out within the hour. Not only are they honest, but genuinely care about me as a customer and I always trust them with my vehicle. Love this place!</Review>

I was given information pamphlets. They had to reschedule my appointment, and gave me discount of $10. They didn't have enough staff that day. Not the cheapest place, but good work.<//review></record>

AAA picked me up...my alternator went out on the 5N freeway at rush hour. The tow truck took me to Western Brake and Tire later that evening. The Key drop box was easy. Tech called me the next morning and had my SUV ready by noon.<//Text>

I was very happy with my service. I was told by another auto shop that I needed front and rear brakes as well as new rotors. My car only has 48k miles and was less then 3 years old. After going to Western I was told I only needed brakes and not the rotors. The cost was also half of what I was quoted at the other shop. They have earned my future business and I recommend them highly.< /Text>

I came out of work to find I had two, completely flat tires. I called AAA and needed my car towed somewhere. Lucky for me, I called Western. Alex found me the best tires, at the best price and even filled out the rebate paperwork for me. The service was extremely friendly, helpful and professional. I have definitely found my new tire service/brakes location for our vehicles. My car rides so smooth and quiet now!</Text>

I'm always worried when trying to find new service businesses, especially for my car, my vet, and doctors. But, I lucked out when I found Western Brake & Auto on the first try. They have been amazing. My previous car had many issues from oil leaks to alignment issues to a/c and heating issues and they were very fair in price and off the charts service. Everyone there is super friendly and able to tell me my car's issues in a language I can understand. Paul & Joe are like the cousins you can always rely on to help you through a tough spot. I highly recommend Western Blake & Auto. So much so, that when I moved from Anaheim to LA, I didn't hesitate to continue to make the drive down to Western Brake & Auto when I need service or repairs. They will continue to have my business for as long as I'm in Southern California.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Time>

The price for the exact tires I wanted was $400 below Pepboys. The staff were respectfully kind and helpful. They called to let me know everything was going well and on schedule and called to let me know when the Jeep was ready to be picked up, two hours ahead of schedule. Our Jeep is like new and my wife and I could not be more pleased.
Thank you Western.</Review>

I’ve been coming here for all car service needs. I trust them to take care of my car to keep it running like new. I find their prices reasonable. I just got an oil change and my car is running great. I’ll be getting new tires from here in the next couple of weeks as well.< /Review>

I took the SUV in for a creaking sound in the suspension. I told the service writer about the noise and he had their mechanic go with me for a test drive. The mechanic did a few maneuvers to test for the noise and he heard what I was describing. They did the repairs and it appears to have fixed the problem. I can’t remember the last time a mechanic test drove a car with me! Exceptional service! A pro shop. Neat and clean.</Text>< user_id>

I have my car serviced at Western Brake and Tire on a regular basis.  I either get an appointment or if they aren’t too busy will drop by to get my car serviced.  I get my usual oil change along with a vehicle inspection and tire rotation during the service.  Joe, Paul and the crew are always timely, friendly, and most importantly - reliable!</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Both brake light were out, so this was kind of an an emergency!
Being a girl, the assumption is plan to get looted at a mechanic shop. However I was pleasantly surprised! I called on a Saturday an hour before closing and the gentleman who answered the phone explained there always is the chance they might have to order the lights, but they will try. My lucky day they had the bulbs an I was offered coffee while I waited. It wasn’t much of a wait it was done in five to ten minutes. I didn’t even have the chance to finish my coffee. They gave me the best early Christmas gift ever, SAFETY. A truly wonderful experience.
It’s good to know that there are such kind people out there.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>I work near this business so I started going here out of convenience about 6 years ago. I decided to keep going back because they won my confidence that they're honest. With 3 kids and 4 cars I've gotten tires and service here many times. I've also recommended them to friends and coworkers. Their prices are on par with the area - so not excessive but not rock bottom either. What they do offer is quality service that they back in the off chance there's a problem. And, they're friendly too.< /Review>< time>

A friend's car was making a noise. Thinking it was the brakes, drove over to have this shop check it out.  They took the tires off check and asked many times "Do you have a warranty or did you get the extended warranty?" They were so professional and helpful. The encouraged us to take the car over to Orange Ford. They did not charge a fee.  We are very impressed by their courtesy and friendly attitude.   I would recomend this shop to everyone.</Text>

When asked they said they just had to settle in, it was fine and it was normal.  We weren't totally sure but it was past closing time, and we lived over 2 hours away.  4 months later and they're kaput, and it's Going to cost us a 1800 to get it back to working condition. Needs new pads new rotors, leaking brake fluid and the calipers locked up on some of the wheels.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

My brakes went out. When I got to the shop I had to wait an hour to get a quote. The quote was $400+. I was told that the problem was my master cylinder, part came out to $170 and the $230 was labor. I priced the part on the high end at $90 and the part is only held on by 4 bolts. That plus bleeding the brakes doesn't come out to $230 worth of labor. I walked. I took my car to another mechanic and it turned out that my master cylinder was fine. The problem was a broken brake line.</text>

Getting new tires for my PT Cruiser. Great prices, great customer service and they have a Kuerig coffee maker with all the flavors I never seen before. If your tires are balled, bring in the vehicle and they will take good care of you.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Thank you Joe and company. I was on vacation and ended up leaving these guys quite a present in the middle of the night. I was so worried I was going to get "raped". Small town country boy in big town city. I am pleased to say these boys really treated me well and were honest and fair. No raping here. Thank you so much. If i lived there I would be a customer for life.<//Review>< Pictures>

This shop has been doing our work for years now on our fleet of service trucks as well as my personal vehicles. I always try to use this shop because the service and quality is excellent. Probably the nicest, hardest-working team I've ever encountered. Very honest, professional and knowledgeable.<//review>

They really take the time to get to know you and your vehicle. Fairly priced, and fast, friendly service. Very family- oriented type of feeling there; you're not just a number!<//text>

(Translated by Google) They do not know about mechanics in this place, they think that the computer will solve the faults, they change expensive parts, they do not solve the problem and they do not give you a guarantee of the work👎👎👎

<review>My partner and I are really happy with our decision to go with MasonMac for our home-purchase. James Harrington was fantastic to work with, always proactively kept us up to date, and was even willing to talk after normal business hours to help us move quickly through the underwriting process. Thanks to James, we were able to go from accepted offer to appraisal to keys-in-hand in about 23 days which is pretty amazing. Thank you!</review>< Rating>

Our experience with Felicia was simply fantastic. We found her contact through one of my best Friend, Felicia and her team provided most fast response and professional service; Felicia is very easy to work with highly skilled, I really appreciate for her hard work and immediate response on my pre approval letter at 10PM Sunday weekend on short notice. I'd highly recommend her mortgage financing.</Text>

<Review>It was a pleasure working with Linda on refinancing my home. She kept me well informed throughout the process and was always super quick to respond to any questions I had. If I ever buy or refinance I would choose Linda and would certainly recommend her to my friends and colleagues. Thank you Linda for all you do!</Review>< Resp>

Linda LoGrasso went that extra mile with her impeccable service. From start to finish, she was in constant contact with us. She definitely is an asset and I will recommend her to my family and friends.<//Review>

This is our third time our family has had our loan done through James.  He is a wonderful agent and very pleasant to work with. He provided excellent services. Our case was a little bit tacky, however he went above and beyond to secure the loan for us. He is extremely trustworthy, very professional and knowledgable in the mortgage loan field. I had great communication from him through the whole process. I am very grateful to have had James as our loan officer and I am super happy with our new home. I highly recommend his services to everyone.</text>

From the very first contact to the Close of Title, Felicia was there with help or an answer to any question. At every milestone she made sure everything was understood and explained the next item we would be working on. Her professionalism was appreciated by all parties involved in our transaction. We could not have had a smoother purchase. Thank you so much Felicia!<//Review>

I was referred to Dr. Winter from my wife after I had sustained a chipped tooth. I was told that she was great with cosmetic dentistry and that her and her entire office staff was extremely friendly. My experience was just that and more! Upon entering, Alicia and Deb at the front desk were super friendly and helpful which is huge to me since dentist visits are not generally my most exciting appointments. I was then escorted back by Kat whom I believe was the dental assistant and she too was very friendly and gave me a tour of the office and introduced me to most of the other staff members that we passed by. Once taken to my chair, Kat helped answer all of my questions and helped me understand what we were doing that day and what to expect. When Dr. Winter came in, she was also very nice and friendly like no other dentist I've gone to. As her and Kat were doing their work, they checked in with me periodically to make sure I was doing fine and I don't think I had ever felt so relaxed during dental work! I almost felt as though I could have dozed off in a good, relaxing way. I was impressed at how well my tooth looked after the appointment and started discussing other dental plans I had considered. After the initial visit, I scheduled my next visit and plan to be a long time patient from here forward! I would definitely advise looking into visiting her practice if you are in the market for a home-base dental office or are just tired of feeling anxious about your current appointments! You won't be disappointment by Dr. Winter and her lovely staff!<//Review>

Nicole at Dr. Winter’s office is the best hygienist ever. She’s an absolute pro and I look forward to seeing her! Not only does she do an amazing job cleaning your teeth, she goes above and beyond to make recommendations that help mitigate future issues. She takes such an interest in her patients and I’ve never had anyone care so much about the wellness of my teeth! Always a great experience with Nicole!</text>

<Text>I had been looking for a new dentist as mine had recently retired. I've had my fair share of dental work and know what I appreciate from a dentist. From the moment I walked in, everyone was extremely friendly and genuinely nice. When I got called back I received a tour of the office while being introduced to everyone that was working. Doctors included! It truly was a great experience and I felt like a valued patient! Feels good to know I found my new dentist.< /Text><rating>5</rating><GmapID>0x80dc03fcc841eeab:0x2af9aefa916bfc9b<//GmapID>< UserId.>

Dr. Winter and the group of fabulous women make me feel so relaxed, confident, and excited to work on my smile. I wanted to do this for years, and wouldn’t have hesitated for a moment if I knew how enjoyable the whole process would be. Don’t even look anywhere else! Call now, ask for Debbie and she’ll get you all set up.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Sarah Winter Dental deserves all the praise in the world. From the staff, location, professionalism, and expertise you cannot find a better dentist or dental office. They make you feel like family, and I can honestly say I look forward to going to the dentist. The whole team- Cat, Bree, Nicole, Dr Winter, Alisa, and Debi are absolute rockstars. Thank you guys for everything, so excited about how my teeth are looking.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80dc03fcc841eeab:0x2af9aefa916bfc9b</gmap_id><user>108219740758332507467</user>< resp>

Always without a doubt the BEST, most accommodating dental service at Sarah Winter Dental! Every hygienists is so kind, caring, and warm-hearted, and no matter how long it’s been since my last visit, I feel like they always make an effort to make me feel like I am part of the SW Dental family. Sarah of course goes above and beyond to provide personal care, which I find really valuable in a dental provider to ensure feeling like you’re getting cared for based on your personal needs,  and not just rushed in and out of the office.

Can’t say enough great things about every single time I’ve come to Sarah Winter Dental!<//text>

The hygienist was able to thoroughly clean my teeth - and offered helpful suggestions for alleviating the pain as well as an article that discussed possible dietary ties.

<rate>5</rate><review>This year for many has been a very trying year to say the least.  I would have to say Meeting Dr. Winter has been by far one of the highlights of this pandemic for me.  I had been suffering from migraines and had no idea they could be caused from my jaw. I was clinching so much at night that I had cracked two teeth!  That’s a lot of pressure.
I was not going out at all since March,  she made me feel so safe. Their safety prodigal is excellent. The office is beautiful and so clean.  Dr. Winter not only cared for my teeth but went above and beyond calling to see if I was doing well.  I would highly recommend her and her staff.  You know when she talks to you that you know she truly cares for her patients. My teeth are fixed, she made me a night guard and my migraines have decreased by 85-90%. I sleep better and I have learn our teeth are so very important to our over all health.  You may think a illness has nothing to do with your teeth but a lot of illness can be caused by things going on in your mouth. I also love that she is a second generation dentist (after her father).</review>< pics>

This was my second visit to the office during the pandemic. They have every precaution in place and I felt completely safe. Of course, that’s on top of the usual excellent care I have always received there. The staff are amazing - this has to be the most welcoming  dental practice in the San Diego area!<//text>

<Review>Dr. Winter has assembled an amazing team that is tough to beat!  Your visit will begin with a warm, friendly, professional greeting and no-hassle administration by the front office team led by Debi. The offices are comfortable with lots of natural light. It can’t be easy to do during this time of pandemic, but Dr. Winter’s team makes you feel safe, welcome, and cared for.

Next up is your visit with one of their amazing hygienists. My visit was with Alisa, who was pleasant and friendly, and also clearly good at what she does. Her work was efficient, gentle, and thorough. My teeth felt awesome when she was finished!  Like the front-office team, she assured me and made me feel very safe in this pandemic environment. It is clear that this team has invested heavily - time, dollars, and energy - to create the safest environment possible.

Bottom line, this is a professional, top-notch team and office. They make you feel welcome, safe, cared for, and in the best professional hands from the minute you set foot in the office and for as long as you are a patient!  Do yourself a favor and put your dental health in their hands!<//Review>< name>

<review>I highly recommend Dr. Sarah Winter Dental. It had been years since visiting the dentist- so this could’ve been really bad- but Dr. Winter’s team’s clear directions and efficiency made my appointment great! I was a bit nervous and can’t remember the name of the woman who helped me check in, sanitize, and temperature check, and fill out consents-But She was friendly and made me feel comfortable, which is hard during Covid times! Debbie helped me schedule and explained what to expect (Even checked back with me when our call was cut short). Jenn was kind enough to make sure my insurance would cover my appointment beforehand. Nicole was efficient and quick with my new patient x-rays (didn’t even need to leave my chair for them- Bree came in to help Nicole chart my gum health which made this part very quick!). Nicole also walked me through everything she was doing and what I was doing wrong with brushing and flossing. And finally, Dr. Winter examined my teeth, x-rays, and pictures confirming that Nicole had gone over any issues I might be having and if she saw anything troubling (luckily nothing!). She also has a great Instagram account with tips for dental health and great before and after smile makeovers. So happy I was referred to Dr. Sarah Winter!</review>< UserId.>

<Text>Dr. Winter is so kind! She makes sure that you’re comfortable throughout the entire procedure. They even have tablets so you can watch netflix to distract you from any nerves you may have. I recommend her to anyone looking for a new dentist. Sweet gals, the whole staff :)< /Text>< Pics>

I enjoy the personable interaction at the desk right when I walk in. They take time to remember me and make conversation outside my teeth as well. They are accommodating and super friendly with smiles behind the masks. They follow protocol of covid guidelines and they are right on time with my appointments which I super value!!  Thanks so much I would definitely recommend this dental office to others 🥰<//Text>

<text>Wow!  What a team!  From the moment I walked in the door to the end of my appointment, I knew I was in good hands with professionals that truly care about me and my health.  The front office team is professional, yet very warm and welcoming.  Trina was my hygienist, and she did an amazing job, both thorough and gentle.  Dr. Winter was willing to take the time to explain what she saw in my x-rays and answer any questions I had.  What a great experience all around - I have a new dentist, and you should go see them too!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>I LOVE everything about this place. Dentists in the past have made me scared to go to the dentist. Dr Winter and Danielle are the sweetest people EVER! They made me feel sooo comfortable & like they knew me forever. They made me feel like they care so much about me and what I want my smile to be. Bree is so knowledgeable & made all my future appointments with what’s convenient for me since I do come from out of town. 1000% worth the drive! I can’t wait to come back.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Nicole is one of the best dental hygienists I've ever had.  She is very kind, she takes her time and does a very thorough cleaning, and is gentle.  I don't feel like just a job to her.  She's engaging and has an easy laugh and a good listener.  Also the front staff at Sarah Winter Dental is professional, caring and kind.<//Review>

I went to Sarah Winter dental office for the first time on 3/3/20. It was a wonderful experience from the reception at the front desk, to the amazing hygienist, Trina, to Sarah Winter herself! Trina gave me the best teeth cleaning I have ever had. Dr. Winter was professional, caring, and informative.
I highly recommend this office!

Everyone at Sarah Winter Dental has been wonderful! My husband and I are new patients, and everyone has made us feel welcome and comfortable (in case you’re like me and don’t particularly enjoy the dentist). So far I have worked with Hygienist Nicole and Dr. Souza. Both were very kind with me and were helpful in explaining everything they were looking at as well as tips to improve my dental health. I am grateful to have found Sarah Winter Dental and recommend them to anyone in search of a dentist.<//Text>

Sarah is so very talented and you can tell she really cares about her patients. Look forward to going back for maintenance care, like when do you say that about going to a dentist?!

Dr. Sarah Winter is one of the finest Dentists I’ve ever met. And I’ve gone to several dentists  through my life.  She’s competent, knowledgeable, extremely skillful and has a great sense about the teeth cosmetics. Her staff, as well as Dr. Winter are efficient and friendly. I recommend her very highly!</text>

I have been so pleased and impressed with the kind and conscientious and professional care I have received from Dr. Winter and her staff. Special shoutout to my hygienist Nicole!
Dr Winter fashioned a beautiful set of veneers a couple years ago and I remain thrilled with the results.
The atmosphere in the office is congenial and welcoming.</text>

She fixed some aesthetic black pits on my teeth. My teeth are much whiter and the pits are filled, which will help eliminate the creation of a cavity. Recently, they did a full x-ray and scanned my teeth for the invisalign braces to correct a crooked front tooth.
I definitely recommend Sarah Winter and her staff.<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< pics>

I am so grateful to have found Dr. Winter! I had a really bad experience with a prior dentist that kept me from going back to a dentist for 3 years. The moment I walked into Dr. Winter’s office, I knew I was in good, trustworthy hands. She always makes me feel so comfortable every time I’m there. She has great swag bags too... the coco floss is my favorite!  I couldn’t recommend her more, best dental experience ever!<//Review>

<Review>Sarah winter dental is by far the beat dental office I’ve been too. They are so nice and warming. Their office had a nice homey feeling instead of the typical boring dental office. Leah cleaned my teeth. She was great! Very knowledgeable and gave me a bunch of helpful tips. She was also very gentle I didn’t even feel my shots. My teeth and mouth felt so much better afterwards! Definitely have to try Sarah winter for your next cleaning !</Review>< Pictures>

I wouldn't say that Sarah Winters makes going to the dentist a pleasant experience, something to look forward to, but she comes close.   Nicole always does the job of a consummate professional in cleaning my teeth and finds any areas of concern for Dr. Winters to examine more closely.   Highly recommended.<//review>

I wish I could explain how grateful I am to come across Dr Winters Instagram. I had been looking for places to get my teeth worked on for a beautiful smile for my wedding. It was perfect timing finding her beautiful before and after pictures. When I went in for my consultation she did not pressure me but was very informative of the possibilities to a journey of a beautiful smile. I am now absolutely in LOVE with my smile. I feel like I could trust Dr Winter with my life. I am so confident in her work and so thankful I chose her. The most personable dentist you will ever meet! And she has Netflix for your procedure. :)<//Text>

<text>I am getting Clear Correct Aligners with Dr. Winter and have had the best experience. She is so attentive and always makes me feel comfortable. My teeth are looking amazing and I honestly look forward to coming in to the office and seeing all of the friendly staff members. I used to dread going to the dentist because of a few bad experiences I had in my past. I have very sensitive teeth which typically makes getting my teeth cleaned very uncomfortable. I got my teeth cleaned by Trina and she was so gentle and I have never been so relaxed. Overall I can’t say enough good things about my experience. They care about their patients and it is so refreshing!<//text>< Pics>

Sarah Winter Dental is everything you could ask for in a dentist office and more.  Every part of the experience from scheduling an appointment, the actual procedures, and follow up has been beyond what is expected of a dental office. Everyone in the office treats you like friends and family. I highly recommend. A special thank you to Debi, Leah, and Dr. Winter!< /Review>

<review>Dr. Sarah Winter is the best dentist I have ever been to! Her and her entire staff do an amazing job. I've always dreaded going to the dentist but Dr. Winter and her wonderful team of hygienists and assistants make dental procedures painless and comfortable. When I first arrived at the office, I was greeted by beautiful smiles from the front office staff. After filling out my forms, I was called into the back where I was set me up with a blanket, headphones, and an iPad to watch Netflix. I watched a couple episodes of my favorite show and before I knew it, my procedure was done! I'm so happy that I can finally go to a dentist and have minimal anxiety. I can't recommend this place enough. If you want the highest quality dental experience possible, you have to come to Sarah Winter Dental.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1576684769269, 'text': 'Thank you for your review!

The staff is very friendly and personable. If you are new to the area or just looking for a new dental experience, i highly recommend Sarah Winter. Her and her team helped me have the confidence to smile without reservation.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I have been visiting Dr. Winter's since she took over my previous dentist's practice a couple of years ago. I needed an exhaustive below--the-gumline cleaning. The hygienist  I regularly see is Nicole, I really appreciate her work, thoroughness, knowledge, and especially her enthusiasm for her work. She did an excellent job for me this time (like always). I was comfortable throughout the procedure, and afterwards as well. I had clear instructions for what to do next, and all the supplies to do it. I highly recommend Dr. Winter's practice!</Review>

Never in my life have I been to a dental visit and looked forward to it. Dr. Winter literally is an outstanding amiable person who is very welcoming and understanding. You can tell a lot about a business owner from the way they treat their employees.This felt more like a family household than an establishment. Talk about "girl power"!

Helping the patient feel at ease is key but making the patient laugh and smile the whole time is perfection. Dr. Winter provides a twist of education from a subtle comedic approach forcing the process to fly by.
Leaving her office having been equipped with this new knowledge and even better smile I am blessed to have gone here. I live all the way in Los Angeles and do not mind the drive because the experience is well worth it<//Text>

I must admit, I’m one of those people who completely avoids dentists... I’m a bit of a scardy cat when it comes to needles or other sharp things poking me. Dentist appointments for me had always been soo uncomfortable and painful that I started avoiding them altogether. If I’m being honest I hadn’t had a teeth cleaning in over 3 years before seeing Dr Winter. I’d say I take pretty good care of my teeth on my own but it’s important to have a professional also take care of them.
I originally was just going to come in to Dr winters office for a whitening, but was talked into a teeth cleaning because it would make the whitening results much brighter. So despite my anxiety of the teeth cleaning I decided to give it a shot. Alisa, one of Dr. Winters assistance was the most gentle and compassion conscious hygienists that’s ever worked on my teeth. Without me even expressing my anxiousness, She rubbed a topical numbing gel all over my gums prior to any sharp objects coming near them. She even applied lip balm to my lips intermittently through the cleaning so that they weren’t getting roughed up in the process, I kid you not this was the most easy breezy teeth cleaning I’ve ever had! And now I’m not afraid to come back for my future visits!!
Now my teeth whitening was also super quick and painless, Cat did such an amazing job of keeping my gums protected from any blanching and we achieved two shades whiter than before!
Might I just add what a beautiful and kind group of intelligent ladies work at her office. 10/10 would recommend< /review>

Dr. Souza and her assistant was awesome with me. They were so paciente and delicate, always making sure I was comfortable. Extra point on the blanket and on the screen I could watch my favorite show!!! Plus also for Dr. Souza that carefully explained what she did on me and also what is recommended for the next appointment.  I feel like I have an one year project on my teeth but everything is being taking care timely according to my budget - followed by my Doctor’s advices and priorities.</Review>

Dr. Winter's office has a very comfy-cozy waiting area with coffee and tea! I was greeted right away by the friendly staff, this is not the typical lackluster experience I'd expected from a dental office. The hygienist, Nicole, was very gentle and thorough.

Love the Sarah Winter Dental crew!!

Dr. Winter and her team gave me a great breakdown (that I could understand in non dentist terms) of what was happening in my mouth. They gave me a few options of how I can improve my oral health at home with a few simple suggestions. Dr. Winter also fixed my insecurities about my smile which I am SO grateful for! I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a local family owned dentist.< /review>

My hygienists name was Trina and she couldn't have been more helpful and caring. The whole time she was very aware of how i was feeling, and made sure I was comfortable the entire time I was there. I feel like this dental office goes above and beyond what you would typically expect from dental care.
I got to see upclose high resolution  photos of my teeth through a small camera linked to a large tv. Very cool!
And also I hadn't gone to the dentist is 7 years.... -_____-
So you can imagine how scared I was!
There was a lot of work to be done!
Sarah winter made my experience feel so much better, and made my treatment plan very clear and straightforward.

(PSA: DONT SKIP THE DENTIST FOR 7 YEARS!)
Dental offices can be intimidating, but when you are in the chair at sarah winter's you can look out at the trees and greenery through the bright windows and feel more at ease. It was actually quite relaxing!

And Scheduling was so easy!
The front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating to my schedule.
I'm very happy that I chose Sarah as my dentist, and I feel super confident about the health of my teeth!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Walking into the future of dentistry! I have never seen such attention to detail, kindness and technology in one office. Sarah Winter's office has happy, smart, receptionists, talented assistants, as well as an 'all star' named Alisa who gently cleans your teeth and tells you about cool new dental products that make your life much easier. So gentle!I  Last but not least, have them give you a warm scented towel after your procedure , and you will think you're in a spa!<//Text>

<review>Changing dentists is always stressful.  I have had a lot of wonderful dentistry over the years.   Our dentist, who we loved,  moved  away.  Sarah Winter took over his practice.  WOW!  My first experience was for cleaning with Nicole.  She is so gentle and thorough, best I have had in a long time.  I needed two crowns to replace ones I had for over 40 years (got my money's worth on those).  Dr. Winter is without a doubt the most pain free dentist I have ever met.   She was not happy with the color of the replacement crowns and she had them redone.  They are PERFECT now.  The fit, feel, and look is wonderful.  Have no hesitation; call lovely Liz, she will set you up with an appointment, and the rest of the staff will take care of you like you are family, family you really like!  Welcome to La Jolla Sarah Winter.  We are so glad you are here

2020 update. Another great visit with Nicole our favorite hygienist. Sarah Winter dental is the only place to go< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<text>Outstanding Care!  I'd moved to Sarah Winter's Dental practice as my lifelong dentist had retired, and she made me feel extremely comfortable during what I'd consider to be a terrifying dental situation.  Like many people, I have a fear of dentists, but when it was all said and done, I'd been made very comfortable, and constantly well informed.  When it was all over, and I was handed a mirror, I was extremely pleased, as the work Sarah had done was above and beyond my expectations.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating><time>1486173803605<//time>< user_name>

I recently visited Sarah Winter Dental due to suffering from TMJ and terrible headaches. My friend referred me and told me she was great.   Dr. Winter spent so much time with me and gave me a thorough exam.  She reassured me that she could get me out of pain.  And she did.  With a combination of a splint and Botox therapy, I am totally pain free.  I didn't even realize this treatment was available, but Dr. Winter is an expert.  I've had no issues ever since!!!   I am so pleased and highly recommend going to her for all of your dental wellness needs.  Dr. Winter really took her time with me and explained everything warmly and thoroughly.  Beautiful office and friendly staff!</Review>

<review>Dr. Sarah Winter is the dream dentist everyone wishes for! I have been a patient of Dr. Winter’s for about 2 years now and she is the best dentist I have ever had! She is incredibly diligent, meticulous, and efficient in her work. I’ve had several cavities filled by her, sometimes multiple per appointment, and never once had ANY soreness afterward, which is unprecedented in my experience (I’ve had a shocking amount of cavities filled in my short lifetime). She’s also taken extra time to clean up additional decay on teeth adjacent to the one being filled, so I know patient health and care is paramount to her.
Additionally, I got 4 porcelain veneers put in by Dr. Winter, and the result was absolute perfection, they are incredibly natural-looking, I could not be more pleased with them! Dr. Winter really does have a very discerning eye and executes her vision impeccably.
Her staff is AMAZING, as well! Liz will never fail to brighten your day with her sweet smile and endearing demeanor, and Danielle, Bre and Cyndee are so attentive and warm, they always put me at ease and make me feel like I’m chatting with friends instead of at a dentist appointment! Thanks so much for everything!<//review>< Rate>

I give it 3 stars because on the 1st drop with case on my screen broke which was the reason why I took it in for. It only lasted about 2 weeks. If the screen replaced was a good quality I am sure my screen wouldn’t of broken. The drop was from me sitting down, I had my baby and phone on my lap, grabbed my baby, forgot about the phone and bar broken screen.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

They don’t!!! About a week later the screen had a line going from top to bottom. I took it back to them and they said it’s not the screen. They blamed me saying I probably pushed hard on the screen. I didnt argue with them because it wasn’t gonna to change there mind. Next time I’ll go to Repairology off Del Rosa.< /text>< Pics>

I'm the type of person that stays cracking my screen often and I struggled finding a good phone repair in Los Angeles. I came across this store and came in they were so QUICK and FRIENDLY! Literally only took them 5 mins to fix my screen and CHEAP!< /Review>

Awesome place. The repair guys are super friendly and professional. I needed a new lcd display and screen on my iPhone X and they did a great job. Phone is like brand new again. And it only cost 100.00. Thanks guys!< /text>

They did a great job repairing my Samsung galaxy s9+. Half the cost of other places and had the parts in stock whereas all the other repair stores had a 4 day wait for parts.</Review>

This place is fantastic. I broke my screen and thought I needed a new phone. I took it to this shop and they fixed it good as new. Customer service is great and the price is reasonable. Would recommend to everyone.< /Review>

< review>
FOOD pizza was good. Favorite was pesto where you add toppings. We added pepperoni, sausage, and bell peppers. Bell peppers are sliced thin which is nice. Crust was good and soft. Pastrami pizza pie was good too, more savory. Their ranch dipping sauce is really good. I'm not sure if they make it in house or if they order it from somewhere it sure is good. Three sizes of pizza.

INSIDE casual feel. Definitely sell beer here. Tv 's begins the counter and in the middle. Some arcade games in the other room. Staff was attentive, chill, and straight forward.

PARKING outside lot shared with other businesses in the small plaza. Look for the pizza and pasta sign.< /review>

I AM EXTREMELY UNHAPPY...I order a medium pizza and salad for delivery and paid $44.00. When I was ordering  I asked for three toppings, double pepperoni and garlic. I asked for my pizza to be well cooked as I do not like undercooked pizza. The woman taking my order said it was dry pepperoni so against my better judgment I said go ahead and make it the way you do. I also asked for for light sauce.{see photos} but got no sauce at all.  The dough was soft all over and way undercooked. If this was double pepperoni I’d hate to see a single serving and I detected no garlic whatsoever. I think Domino’s has much better pizza for almost a third of the cost. When I called I was very upset and the woman who took my order was ver6nice. She offered to give me a refit for the next pizza it I didn’t want a free pizza from a place that didn’t do well with the first one. Actually this was my second  delivery and I wasn’t thrilled with the first order. I will get my pizza from Dominos from now on as their crust is very flavorful, their cheese is great and they charge almost two-thirds then what Grand Central charges. I might be over excited about this but when you wait forever an hour and are hungry no didn’t get what you expected then it is frustration</review>

<Time>1619062856770<//Time><Rate>4</Rate><review>One thing this place always struggles with is consistency... a great example of this shows over my past 2 orders (I’m a regular).

3 weeks ago, I ordered my usual, Medium pizza with pepperoni, sausage and extra sauce. Dinner time, same time as always. It was one of the best pizza’s I’ve ever had and I come from New York. It was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of everything I wanted. I could have eaten two of them that night because it was so good. I even tried calling to get the pizza maker’s name, but they were too busy on the phones at the time.

Tonight, I ordered the same exact thing. Same time and all. It was one of the worst pizza’s I’ve ever eaten. The crust was way too think and just completely drenched in grease. It wasn’t cut properly and when you tried to pick up a slice, it was floppier than a wet paper towel and all of the toppings (including cheese) just slid off into a pile of grease. If this was my first experience here, I’d never eat here again.

As a regular, this seems to be a common problem for this place and it is very disappointing because obviously they have spectacular potential. It is another reason why I don’t eat here as often as I never know what exactly I’m gunna get. It’s almost like gambling. 50/50 every time.

I’m giving 4 stars for one reason, which is the pizza I got 3 weeks ago. I’ll never forget that pizza 🥲.<//review>< Pictures>

<Name>Macie Mckay<//Name><Time>1575801049186<//Time><rate>4<//rate><Text>FOOD pizza was good. Favorite was pesto where you add toppings. We added pepperoni, sausage, and bell peppers. Bell peppers are sliced thin which is nice. Crust was good and soft. Pastrami pizza pie was good too, more savory. Their ranch dipping sauce is really good. I'm not sure if they make it in house or if they order it from somewhere it sure is good. Three sizes of pizza.

INSIDE casual feel. Definitely sell beer here. Tv 's begins the counter and in the middle. Some arcade games in the other room. Staff was attentive, chill, and straight forward.

PARKING outside lot shared with other businesses in the small plaza. Look for the pizza and pasta sign.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXxpQt1EaGIc579Ih-qAF1ExU1c0fdJPqCRu2c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiTHBzgSvoX9J_hMWX0llpj6x7gX8djwLQ5Vbn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2L29Zqqc4kQBRZmAGS0IPw7hUEo7__stbi7iL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsN_PXj7OyG0XK2euD5c1RzXv-SioyM2IAXZxC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80998fc763a7c34b:0x5787dc7c41b9e8ad<//GmapID></record>

Solid pizza and good value. Crust is fluffy and a bit doughy, so if you like firm thin crust pizza this one may not be for you. OTOH, if you order a big one, it reheats beautifully the next day and the crust gets nice and crispy.< /Text>

Great staff. Even the cooks have great customer service. HUGE dining room. Comfortable booths. They have a bar. The bartenders/servers are friendly. I will usually wait inside and talk to them instead of going somewhere else while my to-go order is being cooked.

Favorite place of local youth sports teams for many years. They are very connected to the community but they welcome tourists with open arms.<//review>

<text>I purchased the chicken wings spicy. Unfortunately they only sell them as a halve pound. They tasted great and they were very excellent. Honestly I am satisfied. And I understand that I am a working in a tourist town so I have to pay The tourist price.
With that said I need to be wise of my money and never eat there again. Please understand.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>The bread was fresh and delicious. Salad was typical salad bar and fairly fresh. Minestrone soup was tasty and I’m sure the pizza is probably decent. However, the chicken Marsala entry was this weird sweet gravy thingy that barely resembled chicken Marsala. I might go back for pizza but stay away from the entrees.<//Review>< Rating>

Pizza was good, but pricey for me for a 18" $20. Also, I was expecting a larger soup bowl with my dish since it was an add-on, but what I got was a small cup. And one glass full of ice and 40 percent coke shouldn't cost 3.50. Overall, I felt like I overpaid by $20, my bill was 50. Like I said, it was pricey for me. If you want to pay that much for your meals, I'll send you my mailing address so you can send me money. NOW PAY ME FOR MY REVIEW GOOGLE!!!!</review>

If you don't want a pizza delivered for about 2 hours order here. The first time this happened was on Halloween so I understood.  This happened a second time on a random Tuesday night. The pizza was lukewarm.  We had to call and follow up on the pizza after an hour and a half as we didn't know what was happening.<//text>

It was a bit weird that they didn't have any pasta.... BUT once I got past that disappointment and decided to go with something else, it was great! Food was great, staff was great and patient (they had a million teenagers in, that were a part of a sports team) atmosphere was awesome too. I've always loved Grand Central and have never had any complaints.< /review>

Was just placed on ''hold'' for 15 minutes while I could hear everything in the background loud and clear; they took one order, told the woman ordering that it would be 20 minutes, she asked if they could shoot for 15, and the clerk said yes. So they weren't super busy. Once Tina, a different employee, picked up, I told her I'd like to place an order for pickup. Since I don't have a cell phone myself, I called from Google's Hangouts service located in the sidebar of my Gmail homepage. When she asked for my cell phone number, I told her as much, and she became audibly suspicious of me, telling me that she needed a credit card to place the order. This confused me since I've never had a pizza place require my credit card information to place a pickup order I intended to pay in cash, and I don't have a credit card, so this wasn't a valid option for me either. After I had expressed my concern, she expressed a concern, herself, that I was prank calling and wasn't going to come pick the food up after ordering. After becoming frustrated and telling her that I don't have one, she cut me off rudely and asked ''what do you want'' just as rudely. I told her to nevermind, asked her name, and hung up. Kept wanting to try this place but this experience has put me off the location entirely.<//Text>

Staff is super nice and chill and the pizza is so delicious! The dough is so soft and fluffy that even the crust of it is a pleasure to eat.
We will definitely be recommending this place to any friends visiting Tahoe!< /text>

We had a soccer team gathering here and they had plenty of room for us. Parking was pretty full but you are able to park around the area and walk. Staff was really helpful. Place was clean. Service was pretty fast. Portions were pretty generous. Wife loved the pizza crust, I'm more of a crispy thin crust kind of person. It was doughy and chewy. It really was one of her all time favorites. I got the all meat pizza and it was satisfying. I'd go again if I were in the area. A little expensive but not outrageous for what we got.</Text>

Great classic NY style pizza. Been here a long time and not much has changed. I like the Mediterranean pie but all are good. Last time I went I got the roasted garlic which used to be my favorite thing but was leaving this time. Still delicious but something was off. All in a still gets 5 stars for the huge delicious pies!</Text>

We decided to go there again next day and try 2 of their pasta. We all liked it including the kids and they are picky eaters. I recommend this place. The next time we come back to Lake Tahoe, I will make sure I come back to Grand Central Pizza and Pasta with my family.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rate>

<Review>Locals and visitors beware! This was a dining disaster and certainly not worth any return business. After waiting a very long time for our order to come out, the pizza wasn't even hot, as if it had been sitting in the kitchen for 5-10 minutes before being brought out. We had a simple order, a 1-topping pizza and a 2-topping pizza, and one of those was made incorrectly. Also beware that a pitcher of beer will cost $20. At the end, with the delay and the incorrect order, they still charged a high percentage automatic gratuitous because we had a party of 6 that included 3 kids. Steer clear of this place. Go to Lake Tahoe Pizza Company where you'll get good service and be treated with respect.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>NY Style pizza is supposed to be thin!!!!  Door dashed the pizza, it was thick, doughy and undercooked.  And they skimped on ingredients.  And they didn’t put a pad under the pizza and because it was undercooked the ingredients sweat a lot of moisture, and 2/2 the pizza was soaked.  We barely ate.  What a waste.< /text>< Rate>

We used to have a grand central pizza and pasta in carson city and it was my favorite place to go! So when i found out there was one in Tahoe i had to go check it out... We had the whole place to ourselves when we arrived... The service was good.. However the entrees were not as good.. It seemed that it was a one man operation.. The same guy that sat us at the table, was also our waiter and he was the chef... Overall, the food was okay but im definitely not going to make a special trip just to go here.< /Text>

Comfort food and plenty of it.  Shabby but clean interior.  WiFi was down during our visit. Crowded parking lot is a tight fit for anything but a passenger car.< /text>

Always a great experience with each new encounter and I'm happy to call this my favorite local pizza shop. I wrote this in reguards to an exceptionally great experience today with Kieleena & Bryan who put a smile on my face and kept it there the moment I walked in. Exactly the type of home town vibes I cherish and wish more businesses would value. A++ for service & quality!</review>< rate>

Even though you will find a good amount of space for big groups, the pizza is not worth the price, and the customer service was not that great, the server seemed drunk (I say that cause he slurred his words and smelled of alchoho), and I had to go to the front for them to even remember a party of 30 was waiting to submit their order

They charged 18% tip but for the service offered, i would have given less, and we are not coming back<//Text>

This place was amazing. We went for my friend's birthday. The food was amazing, the staff was friendly. When we sang happy birthday with a cake, they turned down the light. It was an amazing night!<//Text>

Have not been in months due to improperly cooked food that resulted in stomach pain.  I notified young man working there by phone and he could care less.  I thought I would give them another chance. Today.  Me and my son both got sick immediately after eating a couple of French fries in the poutin.  Stomach pain and vomiting.  Attempted to call . No answer.  I’m done with this place.  Another 20 dollars for one burger and  Poutin.  Any reputable place would be very concerned about food that makes customers sick.<//text>

Oh wait this was the first time I had them so that's not a fair review.  Nonetheless, man it's good.  The cheese curds are from a special place in the midwest I believe.  I've been here at least three times ordering something different each time and have not been disappointed.  They're very nice people that own and operate the place.  They work hard and still smile at all their customers.<//review>< pictures>

Poutines in Pasadena! They don't have the right kind of cheese so it's not the authentic flavor.  But still delicious in their own way.</text>

The food was okay...
but when we tried to order the lady told us to wait because she was on the phone. After she took our order it took 30 minutes for us to get our food (the people behind us got their food before we did). Next we went to get plasticware most of the knifes had crud on them. The potatoes are good but not necessarily worth the wait.< /Text>

I've been living in SoCal for near 8 years. I've tried every places but this is the one which is the most authentic if you are looking for the Montreal Style poutine. Their cheese curds and sauce and fries are perfect and so fresh. Makes my Quebecois heart melt.< /Review>

<Review>If you snoozed you losed. As of October 2018 the poutinerie is gone, and is replaced by a shawarma shack, which seems very Canadian.<//Review>< pictures>

2.5 to 3*** Poutine good but not enough cheese curds or gravy. Burger was fresh, meat was good but guacamole tasted so-so and looked like it was purchased and not made from scratch. I could be wrong.  Brioche bun was nice.  Cheese selections for burgers very limited- american or swiss only.  Prices are a bit high for the ingredients offered. Drink selection is very limited too. Parking is tight as there are other popular stores in the corner mall. Sign is small so be on the lookout.  Seating is limited.< /Text>

Really, really great. The poutine is fantastic. Good portion sizes. A petit is enough for a full meal. Meal is for 2-3 people. Burgers aren't AMAZING, but they're pretty good. Lots of toppings to choose from, and they're pretty generous with them. You absolutely have to try the authentic if you've never had poutine before. Once you're used to that, the Mexican Fiesta, Rocky, and the pulled pork one are all really good. Go stop by and try something. You won't regret it.</Text>

Came here to try the poutine a few months back and was a pleasant treat. Saw the menu and had to come back to give it full juatice, I came here with a friend and had ordered the Slawburger, Crispy chicken burger with a side of friend cheese curds and fries. Food was great just not a fan of brioche buns but they have a pretzel bun alternative overall amazing staff great food and environment! Definitely a place to try out and come back too.</Text>

It was also the first time i ever tried a Poutine and it was so great I just want to go back for some more lol.

We live about 25 miles away, but often make the trek to eat here. There are a lot of other places that make something they claim is "Poutine", but somehow they screw up the gravy or cheese.  Not here. The Authentic is the best poutine I've had outside of Quebec! Crispy fries, squeaky cheddar cheese curds, amazing Brown gravy. Mmmmm.

The Spuddburger is basically an Authentic on a burger... possibly the best of both Canadian and American comfort food.  So good!

The staff and owner are friendly and helpful. Spudds is definitely recommended, especially if you're a Canadian expat looking for a real taste of home.</Text>

1st time to eat poutine and I asked myself "good gravy what have I been depriving myself of"? I didnt expect whole in the wall food to be so good.   My friend and i both got burgers which were big and juicy and full of flavor and we shareed the traditional poutine.   They were fast friendly and delicious.  A little pricy but worth every penny.</Text>

Been here twice and will definitely come again, great burgers.  Their pretzel bun is a great compliment to a great burger.  I went simple cheese 2/3 lb patty and regular fixin's.  BUT this is not to convince you of what this place is really about...poutine!  The pulled pork poutine is to die for.  If you want a simple plain ol' Poutine you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Good curd and good gravy and tons of options to please all the foodies out there.  Come give it a try you won't be disappointed.</text>

I live in the area forever & never heard or been to this place. Its definitely well hidden. If no one introduces you to this little Mexican restaurant you may never know about it. You would literally drive by & not see it. It is a very small cramped place, with absolutely no parking, but the food is delicious. Their hash brown was the best I’ve eaten. Very fluffy not flat. I like their variety of tea collection, since I am more of a tea drinker not a coffee drinker. A cup of tea was expensive -WOW-. $5 for a cup of tea. The people were nice, yes & their food was great. I did indeed enjoyed my meal & I will more likely return.< /Review>

Ate here a few times while staying in San Pedro and the food was always delicious and fresh! Would definitely eat here again if I’m ever in the area.<//Review>

The food is really good. You get a lot of food for your money. There aren't that many tables maybe like 20? So there can be a bit of a wait if you go when it's busy. Super friendly staff super cute vibe in the cafe. Would really recommend to anyone! Everything tastes 10x better than Denny's or IHOP!</Text>

Food and ambiance was phenomenal. Servers seems a little overwhelmed, but don't let that disuade you. Breakfast was superb.< /Review>

Had breakfast here and it didn't disappoint, good serving for those who like to have a good breakfast for a good price, wait time was very minimal, and the staff were great. Very hospitable and accommodating. Highly recommend< /Text>

I've only been here once. It's a nice cozy place that has a large and diverse breakfast menu.

I ordered the Egg Benni with fruit (see pic). I asked for a medium poached egg and it was cooked just that way. The fruit was fresh and very tasty. It's a good way to go if your looking for a lite meal.

The service was very prompt even though it was packed and the prices were reasonable.<//Text>

I love this place. It’s actually become one of my favs in San Pedro. The breakfast is amazing and my absolute favorite is the Chilaquiles with the green salsa. I’ve had this made many different ways at many different places and although I still love my moms recipe, this is a close runner up. It always hits the the spot. Always. The lattes are amazing and make you feel comfortable and at home. The people are friendly and service is always great. Prices are decent and right on for the big plates you get. Be ready to eat!</review>

I ordered what I thought from the reviews would be great, a breakfast with the option to choose fruit but replacing hash browns or potatoes with fruit and ordering a bagel to compensate wasn't actually as filling as I hoped.  I also ordered a disgusting teriyaki veggie bowl which I don't recommend.< /text>

One of the most delicious and most onolicious breakfast and lunch outside LA. We eat here always before we start shooting our weddings. Amanda is my favorite server and be sure to ask for her. Service is fast and friendly. Coffee is delicious and non-stop.  Small place and can have a long wait. Better to eat before they close it's less crowded.  One of my faves.... cheeeee!!!!</Text>

Used to be a 4 or 5 star place. But over the years it's definitely gone down. Today I went with my grandparents & daughter. Not only did we have to wait like 35 minutes, the hostess opened the door &  as mu daughter was walking in she let go of it almost shutting on her. Then we get seated & our server is not friendly whatsoever. Barely acknowledged us. Never came to check on us until the end of our meal. The food was okay but not really worth the price in my opinion. I've had much better at places like San Pedro cafe which has far superior service.</review>

I dined at Rex's Cafe two days in a row. The first day I almost got the California burrito, but decided instead on the turkey bacon melt. Don't do it, it's not good. I honestly couldn't tell if it was turkey or ham. But I also got the black bean chili and a bagel, both of which were delicious. The second day I went in and got the California burrito that I should have gotten the first day. It was basically a breakfast burrito stuffed with eggs and black bean chili. (I am thinking about it right now and kind of want to go get another one LOL.) It's a cute little diner. Pretty clean. Decent staff. I will dine here for breakfast/brunch the next time I'm in San Pedro.</Review>

<Text>I’d share a photo, but the food disappeared too quickly.  Reasonable price, great food, great place for a mellow morning for some eggs and coffee.  Well worth stumbling into it on the first day of vacation.   French Toast was by far some of the best.  Nice thick bread slices, lots of fresh fruit, I didn’t even use syrup.</Text>< pictures>

Nice breakfast at a good price. The staff was generally friendly, and food was mostly quite good. The menu had good options, and fruits and vegetables we're fresh and delicious, like avocados in several dishes. But a few things in the order came out wrong, and it had taken long enough for the food to come that it didn't seem important enough to fix. And the toast was dry and hard. So four stars not five, quite good but not outstanding.<//review>

San Pedro is starting to grow on me with another hidden gem! I've heard that there are many great breakfast/brunch places in San Pedro and this is one of them.

My friend and I arrived here on a Saturday morning around 11am. Since we opted for first available seating, we were led outside to their small patio. The waitress took our order and the food arrived shortly after.

I had the veggie scramble with breakfast potatoes and a lemon muffin. I pretty much licked my plate clean and did NOT feel uncomfortably full. The veggie scramble was made with fresh veggies such as mushrooms, mini broccoli, tomatoes, onions, and zucchini. Everything tasted "light" and not much grease was left on the plate. The potatoes were seasoned and cooked just right.

I had a couple of bites of the lemon muffin and I really enjoyed the small lemon chunks, it made the muffin unique in texture as well as taste. It wasn't too sweet or dense.

Service was friendly and efficient. Portions are fair. Credit cards are accepted. What more can I ask for?!

By the way, street parking only, but not too difficult.< /Text>

<rating>3</rating><Review>Overall the food was okay and the prices were reasonable for the area. Service was fine. The main issues are came here looking for a cafe. This is a resturaunt. Also the food was basic and uninspired. The sandwiches were something I could make by going to the local grocery store and grabbing 4 items. The black bean chili was lightly seasoned black beans with a scoop of sour cream.

In the end the food was okay but I left feeling I should have just stopped at the grocery store and saved some money.< /Review>< pictures>

Rex's is fantastic, a San Pedro staple. I've been going there for years & I understand why there's a line on the weekends.
Tip:
Ask to have coffee outside while you wait<//text>

<Text>I got to the cafe early this morning at 7:30 am and was pleasantly surprised by the attractive appearance of the exterior and interior spaces of the place. The colors were warm and appealing. I had a simple breakfast of eggs (over hard) and ham (a real slice of real ham!) wheat toast, coffee, and fresh fruit. The fruit deserves comment because it was a varied collection, and all very good. All the food was of high quality and well prepared. Service was first rate.The cafe had a very pleasant atmosphere and decoration of the interior spoke of someone with an artistic background and cultural sophistication. I asked and got a menu and a well designed business card. All in all, a good breakfast at a reasonable price. I will be back.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Parking is almost non existant. But this little diner is worth the challenge. First the sweet young host greets and seats you. Then the bus slash waiters assistant gets your drinks. I suggest the Arnold Palmer, Cinnamon stuffed french toast. Sorry no pictures i ate first then posted later.</Review>

The Grilled Steak Sandwich w/ avocado was good....the waitress charged me $14.95 for what was listed as $8.95 on the internet menu.  There is a wheelchair barrier at the entrance so I ate outside on the porch.   I WILL NOT GO BACK.</Text>

<text>I was majorly disappointed when I had breakfast here with a coworker the other day. The prices were pretty steep especially for the small portion sizes. I ordered bacon which was eventually served to me but was overcooked and inedible. It was replaced but the incident left a long-lasting bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively< /text>< Rate>

This is a cute cafe that is totally worth checking out. On a three day trip, I almost came here twice (unheard of for me). The lack of seating for larger parties is the only downside, but other than that everything is great. The coffees are the best part (in my opinion): they come out in huge bowl-like cups and are very ornate. The food is also very solid for the price. Overall, a great experience at a fair price.< /Text>

Wonderful breakfast food, ample portions, and excellent service. It is street parking only but they suggested parking in the liquor store's parking lot around the corner. If you need breakfast you can't go wrong with Rex's.< /Text>

<review>Its pretty good, first time here. Lots of.cops here o_o
I ordered a Mocha an it came in this huge cup! Didn't know how to drink it. Taste alright but I'm not a coffee guy.
Also ordered Rex Omelet, comes with two sides; fruits and muffin. Portions are really good, could not finish cause it was so much.
Overall I really love the muffin.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dd37d20bb1ceaf:0x6ccf1a3136f28713< /gmap_id></record>

I went here today for breakfast.  I was encouraged by the reviews I read online.  There were a couple of other tables occupied on a Wednesday morning and the service was 5 star!  It isn't cheap.  Granted the portions are generous, but a cold drink, 2 blueberry pancakes and a side of bacon was nearly $20 with tax.  We have reached a point in Southern Cal where even a basic breakfast is over $15 per person now before tip!  Are food costs really that high?< /Text>

The only thing that was dissapionting is finding parking,
Its small but very cozy, i sat outside, staff was excellent showing me what options they recomend for omletes, very satisfied in having the Cali omlete with potatoes very delicious.
Food service was quick and staff very attentive.
Im a local and would come back again,
For a relaxing good morning and good food with great service come to Rexs cafe.< /text>

Great service ok breakfast. My eggs were served too hot on my sandwich and I burnt the roof of my mouth. I had a breakfast sandwhich and hash browns, both were ok. Mom and pop type of feel, they only take Visa/MasterCard payments.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A wonderful discovery !!! I highly recommend it and will return soon. Everything was excellent - omelettes, hash brown, coffee latte and pancakes are soft and huge. They have a nice card. The restaurant is cozy and charming. The staff is helpful and friendly. It's a busy place but it's worth it 😉

Une merveilleuse découverte !!! Je le recommande fortement et j'y retournerais prochainement. Tout était excellent 😊 les omelettes, le hash brown, le café latte et les pancakes sont moelleux et énormes. Ils ont une belle carte. Le restaurant est cosy et charmant.

<text>(Translated by Google) Excellent place to eat - I go there every time I go down to San Pedro, it's a must. Parking is not easy though. It is a place where there are many people because the dishes are excellent and plentiful. Fresh and quality products. We had a rex omlette and a mediterranean omelette with a spicy (light) sauce. I love their pancake, they are the best. They are soft and tasty 🥞👍🏼 Their Latte is very good. If you are in the vicinity, stop!

Excellent endroit où manger 👌🏽 j’y vais à chaque fois que je descends sur San Pedro, c’est un lieu incontournable. Le parking n’est pas facile par contre. C’est un lieux où il y a beaucoup de monde car les plats sont excellent et copieux. Des produits frais et de qualité. Nous avons pris une rex’s omelette et une méditerranéenne omelette avec une petite sauce épicée (légère). J’adore leur pancake, ce sont les meilleurs. Elles sont moelleuses et goûteuses 🥞👍🏼 Leur Latte est très bon.

Great little Asian store, parking is a task, but I usually park on the street for easy parking.  Many great selections for a little store plus Chinese hot foods, like Chinese bbq pork, roast duck, soy chicken, and chow meins.<//review>

My dad is Chinese and is particular about what he shops for. Ho Chin is the market he always tells me to shop at. We have been going there since I was a kid. Great selection and great service! Get the BBQ pork belly! It is delicious!</Text>

They don't speak much English here, but it is a great small grocery store with a little bit of everything.  I love their hot kitchen in the back. Fried rice and Chow mien made to order.  They also have roasted pork, soy sauce chicken, etc.  All at a reasonable price.< /text>

Food is good, certain days fresh vegetables are good and nice price. Would like to feel comfortable and not like a crook when shopping there, my family and I are regulars, that might change< /text>

Great little store with lots of items! Be sure to check out the back for hot food items like roast duck and BBQ pork. The price is very fair. Beats many larger supermarkets hands down.</text>

Went early in the morning. Staff was just as awesome and cool with helping me look for what I wanted. Made perfect suggestions for me to look into. Item was not on the shelves, so staff told me how to go online to find it. They even helped me with my online order. Great people<//text>

I love that you can return Amazon items there at the Amazon return kiosk in the store. By the next day your Amazon account is credited for the rerurn. Plus, Kohl's gave me 25% in the store for visiting Amazon. Pretty good partnership.<//Review>

Love Kohl's, their cash is awesome! They have really good clearance and sale's! That makes up for some of the other high end stuff that I can't afford! Staff is friendly and professional! I love shopping there, I can take my time and never feel rushed! So, it doesn't matter what kind of deal's Walmart has to offer, I'd rather be treated like a human being than take advantage of any of their deal's!< /review>

If you needed help you got quick service it's not crowded at all but plenty of workers to help you they have floor spacing where you guys stay six feet apart when you're in line to pay for your stuff and they make you wear a mask and they wear a mask</Text>

Was overcharged, the discount tag did not match what I was charged. When I returned one of the seven items,  I lost my Kohl's cash. It would have been nice if the clerk let me know that. I would have bought a different shirt or item to keep the cash. I would have been happy and the store would have sold more merchandise.</Text>

<Text>Brought my mom to purchase shoes that were on sale and the girl at the register wanted to charge her the original price even after we brought her the box with the discount tag on it. She then called her manager to make sure we didn’t put the tag on there & told her that those shoes were on sale. She was flat out rude and did not apologize. Very disappointed. Her name tag said Amazing Alexandria but I think NOT. Definitely needs to go through customer handling training again.<//Text><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x8091424b3f308475:0xbd4bf5d8133261c4<//Gmap_id><rating>1</rating><user_name>Isabel Barboza<//user_name></record>

Hard to find people working on the floor during the holidays. Clothes off hangers and on the floor. It is kind of depressing in women's area but most of the rest of the store looks inviting...as long as you do not need a breathing, healpful associate not tethered to a cash register.< /review>

Today I was at Merced, CA store to return amazon item and then take a walk around the shoes section and checking out the price tag. Ridiculous store, The tag says sale but the price are still the same as regular price. I see why Kohls losing customers, because they are ripping off customers. I do not recommend you folks go shop at kohls.</Text>

< Review>
Store is well lit. And they have several options to pay for your articles. Store was well lit but hard to find things. Layout is a bit confusing. Prices are a bit high. Unless you like paying for a brand name. They offer some good deals but agian watch out for sales they may just have been overpriced to begin with.< /Review>

It's an alright store. I'd give it a third star if their shoe department was cleaner/better organized than it is. The majority of the time when you try to find your size, they don't have it or if you see a shoe on display, you can never find the box and size it corresponds to. Oh well.<//Text>

Very disappointed in some of young girls. Their attitudes and the disrespect with customers! My husband took our daughter to purchase some clothing and it happened to be buy one get 50% off another so he did that and both came up regular price so he told her where he got it and the associate was mad and ignored him she literally walked away from him. We haven’t had time to call corporate but will as soon as possible. This happened  in the return area. Not all employees are rude and shouldn’t be at fault for their rude co-workers!</Review>

Monica ,Josh and Victor at the Kohls in Merced ca has excellent customer service  .I went to Kohls on this past Friday at 8 pm and they helped me what I needed. It is nice to have workers help you what you need not too many stores have great customer service I can said every time I go to Kohls they always help their customers and always have great sales and coupons. I will give the Merced Kohls 10 for great customer service.</Review>

This was the worst most insultive and horrible place I have ever been. I was shopping with my husband and out of no where asked to go to the office while NAKED, told to just go to the office without my shirt on. Then while in there was surrounded by men (male cop included) accused of stealing, searched (with hands held behind my back so I could not move and stop him from innapropriately grabbing my breast.) Even after finding nothing on me or in my purse was told I was banned because I supposedly had previously been asked to leave (never happened). Then made to sign papers and told they were just papers outlining what happened that day. Saw after they were papers admitting guild to stealing whatever they wrote in the bottom part (was blank when signed). I told them if anything was written there it was fraud.  They had NO video footage of me or my husband stealing. Didnt search my husband but sent him outside before they came and searched me.... This is a serious invasion and sexual assault. I have hired an attorney and will sue Khols as well as Flash (LP) and pressed charges on police officer involved..... Who by the way told me he would testify against them because they seemed to have framed me with false missing merchandise. Finally they showed me a video that was not me. (3 inches shorter, 80lbs heavier with chin length hair while my hair is down to my rear end). Don't go there!!!<//text>

<Text>Always has great sales and rewards. I always use my kohl's card to receive my discounts. Clothing here is great quality and the price is right. I also buy shoes here but it tends to get very disorganized in this department sometimes hard to find what you need. I usually just go to the one in Turlock I believe it's better maintained than this location. But over all its a good place to shop< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
The last few times I went there looking for shoes I couldn't find my size.  I like to shop local so I always go to Kohl's in my hometown.  Well this last time really was bad. I was there for 30 minutes with at least 3 employees shuffling around me.  No one greeted me nor asked me if I needed help. I went away empty handed and went to another store where  I was helped and I bought 2 pair of shoes. I have a Kohl's card and my balance is at zero.  Can't find any help when I'm there to even buy anything.<//Review>

It was a waste of time. I went to buy a few things I saw in the ad but when I found them I had no costumer service. Although there was plenty of staff around me not one employee asked if I was doing ok or made eye contact with me as I struggle to find the sz. It almost seems like they were suspecting I was going to walk out with merchandise. Some of them need to pay attention to their guests rather than making me feel uncomfortable and lost of words...</text>

BLACK FRIDAY REVIEW ONLY-

I am a normal KOHLS shopper. I typically shop the clearance racks and try to use coupons or KOHLS cash to make my savings go further.

However, for Black Friday, the KOHLS cash you get beforehand is not applicable to be used on black Friday. It starts on the 24th, that Saturday. Because of this you dont get the best savings or deals. For example, on black Friday the xbox 360 S with 1T is selling at Wal-Mart for $199, Target for $199 plus a $10 Target gift card.....but Kohls is selling it for $299 and $60 kohls cash. So even with the given kohls cash you're still overpaying by $40. There are many examples like this throughout Black Fridays sale at Kohls. Majority of their items are severely overpriced and they do not price match. However, buying their higher sale priced items stacked with your 20% or 30% coupons really makes the difference. Kohls controls the 15%, 20%, 25% offs. The manufacturers controls their 30%, 40%, 50% or higher sales. So this is where your Kohls coupons really pushes your savings!! They will be selling a serta cool gel topper for 50% off...and coupons are avail on it. This item is normally $250, but after all the coupons and savings you can get it for $89 for the queen! That's the cheapest price anywhere! You just have to do your homework!!

I've done Black Friday since every year since 1995 and I'd advise to look at Wal-Mart or even Target for the exact items first. Now, dont get me wrong, I love Kohls, but if you're looking for something specific and a great deal than search for it first.

Amazon, Groupon, Kohls, and Target shopping at most of these places a day beforehand might actually be cheaper than getting it on  "Black friday" itself. I bought what we wanted to buy on Black Friday at Kohls 2 days before Black Friday and used my Kohls cash and coupons and what wouldve been a $300 purchase for only $40.

Kohls employees are always super helpful and sometimes they help you out if you forget your ad coupons at home!! Dont be rude since many of these young kids are seasonal during this time of year!

Happy thanksgiving and happy hunting!!< /text>

The racks were a mess and the bathroom was disgusting.  Friendly staff but was not impressed. It reminded me of Wal mart.</text>

One of the nastiest stores that I have ever went to in my entire life. I opened the dot for an employee and they just walked in and out and didn't even say thank you. I dismissed that, and I found all the clothes scattered all over the floor and everyone looked at me like I committed murder or something. That was odd, anyways, I went to the fitting room and all the doors were locked what a surprise, And for a fact I know that nobody was inside. I asked the cashier why the fitting rooms are all locked around the whole store, And she responded with "How is that my problem?" I simply just left and I'm never going to that store ever again.</review>

They don't accept dogs yet they don't POST that anywhere in there entrances. Staff is never around to help. They don't have more than half the items other Kohl's have. I've been to many kohls before and not one of them deny me walking inside with my dog.

Too bad, i cabt give them a lower grade.<//Review>

<Text>Their services has greatly diminished in quality since they first opened several years ago. One used to be able to use multiple coupons at once, but now the Merced stores won't let customers do so, even though the coupon does state "save an additional blah blah blah" it does not state "one coupon per purchase". Also, customers were allowed to use Kolhs cash and promotional discounts after expiration date, within reason (a day or two after) this is no longer the case... but the worse was yet to follow: Christmas season.. I go in during my lunch hour and grab 3 scarves. I see the line at the front is about 13 people deep and only one register is open, so keep shopping to see if the line thins out or another register opens. Then I see the cashier at the jewelry counter is pacing back and forth with NOTHING to do. I'm in luck! or so I thought. there was a sign at her counter that said she couldn't not take purchases that were not from that  department. so... I see the employee at customer service.. no customers in line, yay!... wrong again.. he sees that I only have a small purchase to make, but he says he can't help me with my regular purchase there either. He said returns, payments and online pick up orders only. needless to stay, I did not waste my hard earned money there! I went to JcPenny's and bought 3 scarves, payed for them at their jewelry counter. Even though I had a small purchase, they lost about $40 and a customer, I am cancelling my Kohls charge card. Management is not only losing money, they are wasting it paying employees to watch the dust settle instead of helping paying customers.< /Text></record>
