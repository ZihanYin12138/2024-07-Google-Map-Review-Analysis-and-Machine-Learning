{'time': 1452012188595, 'text': "Thank you for the great review! I feel that when the manufacture makes a faulty product that it should be repaired under warranty even if it was out of the warranty period. They knew they had a problem or they wouldn't have redesigned that part. When you are in an industry as long as we have,  you gain some allies in high places that can help out if the need arises.   I'm Glad it worked out for you.   Jim"}</resp>
<Review>Simply the best! Jim, who I kept calling Dan, is a master of his craft. The most knowledgeable individual for all lawn machine related issues. He might  be a mechanical engineer for the way he speaks and part time teacher for the way he breaks it down in understandable terms.

He has the best relationships with both suppliers and customers. He has earned another customer for life with his level of customer service and most importantly follow through.

True integrity at this shop. Highly recommend because I know they will do what's best for their customers.</Review></record>

This is a well run and professional operation. I had a weeder, chain saw and snowblower serviced or repaired. I would recommend them to anyone needing service or to purchase landscape tools.</Review>

<review>Dan's is the best small equipment shop I have found in the area. Jim, Lynn, Olivia, Patrick, and the other mechanics always give you a fair and honest assesment of your repairs.  Whenever I buy a new machine, I go do Dan's.  I'd rather pay an extra $20 or so over the cheapest on-line price to have them prep it for me, start it and run it, and make sure the warranty gets registered.  And there really is a Dan.  He leaves the public workings to his staff, but he is there, lurking in the back somewhere, making sure the customers are well served.<//review>< response>

<review>I have a Zero Turn mower, took wheel and bearing to Dans looking for replacement. They had to order complete wheel and bearing but took them 6 weeks, when they had told me it would only take 5-7 says! You know how much money I list cause of their incompetence.< /review>< pictures>

<response>{'time': 1452010964648, 'text': "We are very sorry you had a problem with your parts order. We do offer 5-7 day parts orders and even sooner if you are willing to pay for the shipping cost, but either way if the manufacturer of your product does not have the part in stock then there is a delay that's beyond our control. The only Z rider wheel that I can recall that was ever a problem was a brand that we do not sell, do not endorse and was the wrong wheel that someone installed on your machine and that's the reason why the first set of bearings did not fit and a new wheel had to be purchased. We see this pretty often when someone needs something right away and installs anything that will work or buys a used part somewhere just to get the mower back out into the field.\nJim"}</response><gmap_id>0x80c34d6c915ef435:0x8e16f7e3ac7c58f2<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>Super expensive and closed on the weekend!< /Review><Response>{'time': 1561142363708, 'text': 'Mr. Bedlington, we\'re very sorry you feel this way.  I assume you are the one who called about repairing several units and wanted estimates over the phone without someone inspecting them first, then complaining we were not open on the weekends?? Estimates are very difficult to do over the phone especially after you said they had running problems. The only honest way is with a tech inspecting the unit to see what is wrong.  Our pricing is up to date with current market trends when comparing top Power equipment Dealers and in some cases we are actually too low. These figures are also factored when we determine the cost of doing business. Our long term dedicated employees have family\'s to feed and mortgages to pay and they do not make minimum wage.   We also do not run a cash only, cash wages, no insurance, avoid paying taxes business and never will.  We also have many expenses to running a successful business of our type that you may be unfamiliar with such as manufacturer training, software licenses, department of weights and measures, Hazardous waste generation permits, and the list goes on and on, so being the "cheapest" will probably not happen, but we will charge a fair market rate that will assure we can stay in business for many more years.\nOur hours of operation are adjusted to work around the 95% of our customer base which is primarily made up of professional landscapers, municipalities, contractors and school districts. Mr. Bedlington, after working 6 days a week for nearly 3/4 of my 35 years of this career, I now look back and see all my kids baseball games that I had to miss or the family time that can never be replaced. We are not greedy work 7 days a week people. Our employees need some time off to recoup and spend time with their families also.  There are several commercial power equipment dealers who have the same hours for the same reason. There are also many other shops that are in fact open on Saturdays and that\'s great and convenient for those who cannot make it during the week, but it\'s no reason to bash those who are not with unprovoked, unwarranted, negative on line reviews.\nJim'}</Response>< Rating>

Absolutely wonderful. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. They were open late and were incredibly hospitable considering the drunken crowd that was wandering in at night. They were efficient and the restaurant was clean. I will definitely be back!</Text>

<rate>3<//rate><text>Not gonna mince words, this is not a good Italian restaurant. The pizza was alright, but the pasta was rushed and the ravioli appeared to be stuffed with a paste resembling meat. That said, I think this place serves its purpose. It closes at 2 AM, so it's a great ending for a night of drinking. If you don't care for taste, and just want some pasta, feel free to drop by.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Great pizza!!! My only concern is the cheesy bread is so addictive!!! Yet, I’ve been told one order has half the calories of two orders 😊. You can tell the marinara sauce is home made with a real Italian touch!<//review>

Very good. Took my kids here for lunch. Sat outside in their small outdoor area, it was nice. We got the pizza, crust was crispy, and pizza was cheesy just the way I like it! They give out a good amount of toppings as well. Definitely worth the try!< /review>

<review>As of any business I have searched menu of, this place has the most detailed scale of toppings that co$t extra charge$.  As meat be equal extra charge to cheese that I not want cheese, how difficult will it be to replace meat instead of cheese?  I note this place, as with too many others, are not revealing the diameter to its pizzas.  As showing it was more of a norm in pasttimes before the fall of the economy.< /review>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>This has always been one of my favorite spots in the northpark area until tonight. Tonight’s order between the manager straight up lying about the order being on the way after it was already an hour late: she wanted to catch a tone when I told them to cancel at 90 mins late because I was tired of waiting for food that was on its way for over an hour from 4 blocks away. I ordered from this place one a week at least if not 2-3 times a week: but this one visit was enough to ruin a long relationship<//review>< pics>

I have been coming here for years and have only ordered pasta.  Finally tried the pizza and it wasn't very good.  Overall I still really like this place but will probably stick to the pasta dishes.</Review>

<text>Absolutely Delicious! Large portions for under $10. Their sauce is so fresh and robust. I had the Baked Ziti and my Bestie had the Calzone, will be back whenever we get down to North Park from Oceanside.</text>< pics>

They are good with getting what is needed for you to aid to questions. Also, very organized system for meeting your service.agent. sometimes during the busiest the lines can get a little out if hand. That's why I rate it just a 4 out of 5.<//review>

This was the worst experience I’ve ever had. A worker named Ms. Sanchez wasn’t working with me at all. She had me waiting about an hour. After she shows up she looks bothered and upset. She treats me like if I wanted to take medical from her own pocket. She shouldn’t be working in this place at all.
Bad and attitude and bad service. Definitely do not recommend no one here at this place at all. They play all nice at first and then get tired of you and try to get rid of you! Never in my life will I come back here !< /review>

I cant believe how accommodating and understanding the social workers/case workers here are. It was my first time applying for any type of help for my son and I ever, and was unclear of the process. I had a 'in-home visit' which I'd failed to be home for, and wasn't able to cancel prior to, or even reachable. Something very important had suddenly come up and they couldn't locate or contact me for a week, maybe more. You'd think I would have understandably been dropped from CalWorks immediately. Instead, they tried very hard contact me daily. Finally when they did, and after providing proof of my whereabouts/sudden emergency, EVERYONE was more than understanding. My social worker Victoria, who called me relentlessly, Fatima-my case worker, and her supervisor-unfortunately, never got her name-all helped me out more than I could have even hoped for. I'd put everyone on my case through some confusion and they never held any of it against me and I was always treated with all the respect.
My experience with "social workers'' hasnt always been pleasant and was nervous to ask for help. But this place isn't like that. So, if you are like me, dont be afraid to come here and get the help if you need it. These people are actually willing and here to help.

Edit: Feel I have to share again since my last post 5 months ago. Once again, another great experience. What I tried accomplishing at another office 2 different times and days, yet werent able to.. we were able to resolve in less than 1 hr here at this location..Every worker I've come across here has been amazing!<//Review>

Clean and really fast for helping you if your in need. As long as you put in the effort to help yourself and ask for help you will get in what you put in. Very humbling experience to have to have needed the help in the first place but good place to get services in a timely manner and they really helped me feel like I can overcome this little hiccup in life. Some workers really do this line of work because they care just dont forget that!< /text>

<Review>The best office by far. Very comfortable, considering the reason I go there...
This is a smaller, quieter office specifically committed to calWORKS families. They handle your medi-cal and calfresh, too, but only for those qualifying for calWORKS.

If you just need a replacement card or something simple like that, they can help you even if you're not interested n a case with calWORKS.
Waaaaay more convenient and quick than going all the way to San[a Ana and spending an entire day waiting for a new card or simple form ... Got my new card in less than 10 min...from the moment i walked in the door.<//Review>< Name>

(Translated by Google) I did not like the attention, it took more than 3 hours because the boy who took care of me did not put me in the system and when they were going to see me the worker went to lunch. I had to wait 45 more minutes, although she did her work quickly, but in La Palma she left in 30 minutes for the same process. ☹

I lived in Japan for 7 years or so and was so happy to find this place because the food actually tasted Japanese. There is so many restaurants that claim to be Japanese but they don’t even come close to tasting legit like in Japan. The moment I tasted their miso soup I just knew this place would be really good. So some other things I like about this place, the presentation of the place reminds of a Ramen shop I went to in Nagasaki and really brought up lots of memory lol. The place is well kept and clean. The staff was outstanding when it came to making sure we were taken care of and was very knowledgeable about dishes we didn’t know. The only complaint I have is the bathroom needs a renovation. Other than that I say if you want to taste legit Japanese food give this guys a shot and won’t regret it!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>My favourite out of the 3 done by the same owner. There's a long wait outside best to go very early or later or be prepared to shop around while you wait. The signup sheet is at the front. Tip if you're going with another person, one should get extra pork and share it  you can also ask for hot water to dilute the soup when you're almost done.< /Text>< Time>

The food was not very tasty.  It needed more flavor. This restaurant is divided into two restaurants.  We went to Gunco Ramen which has a different menu from Kanpai which they are more geared in preparing  sushi.  Gunco Ramen's specialty is "Ramen". However, my daughters and I didn't ordered  the Ramen dish as they did not have a vegan choice to pick from.  The prices also vary depending on what you ordered, but in general the prices are high.</review>

I can say this is the closest to authentic you're going to get out of this area of San Diego. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. If you're looking for a place to have a bowl of Ramen and some drinks, I would hands down recommended this place!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The combo came with a mac salad
The serving dish wash the size of a silver dollar, and had about one chopstick full? Very, very little but good. I've ordered it as a side and for the price won't order it again. Very little but awfully expensive. The older Japanese women is very sarcastic and rude.< /review>

<text>Ambience is peaceful, service is cute pero like the flavor/taste is mediocre af, ay. Coming from me, the person who ACTUALLY likes hospital food, is SERIOUSLY sayin something.

I decided to give this place a second chance. I was wrong. 8.50 USD for 5 small slices of BBQ beef ribs, of which were 70% bone, that were advertised as a meal. Gorl, bye.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

My son and I ordered the spicy ramen and it had a terrible smell. The people in the next table had ramen (I don’t know what kind)but they asked the waiter  about the smell of their ramen as well. I only came because it had such high reviews. Never ever again.< /Text>

<review>I have been purchasing various supplies here for years, cabinets, granite, flooring, etc. Recently I needed additional flooring to match product I had purchased almost 2 years ago. Even though it was a small order, Miriam gave the order a high priority and placed a rush on it so that the job was not delayed.  She even was able to get the rush shipping fee waived.  They staff always goes out of their way to make the experience positive.  They have a great manager, Ray, who is supportive and friendly.  Sometimes there can be a wait to get a service representative or to pick up the orders, but I feel that is because they offer a very good price for the quality of their merchandise which has made them popular and successful.<//review>< Pics>

My experience at this place was fantastic, from beginning to end.  I worked directly with Karla, one of their sales employees.  She was amazing, always willing to help, knowledgeable and professional.<//Text>

Spoke to a clerk and asked if they had a particular item in stock he said to come in and check. When I asked again if it might be in stock because its a bit of a drive I was told to go to another store and hung up on.  Horrible customer service.  Unfriendly.   Way to lose business and money.</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>They have terrible customer Service, their sales  people advise you to buy some additional materials and they tell you when your job is completed they can return the left over material with no questions asked, however after trying to retur, their sales person "Karla" is unable to get approval from the owner for the material at full price, and end up giving you discounted store credit,
And when you go back to use your store credit,  they claim that they don't show any credit and the owner stand wathes and doesn't bother getting the matter resolved.
I don't recommend this place.</Text><Resp>{'time': 1598766216181, 'text': 'Hi, Pashai\nI hope you can taking a second review this.\n\nFirst of all, every purchase we sell.

Not very good service. There were only three other customers in the warehouse I had to ask twice for assistance and none came within the 20 minutes that I was waiting around. Eventually just left.</Text>

The company is alright it's just that I have a problem with the values and charter of the people at this particular location. They're not the nicest type of people and I prefer to utilize one of their other locations because of my own principals.Very unkind and anti community. Just bad folks.</Review>

<response>None< /response><review>Large, lots of granite, displays, etc. The cost of granite has gone up with the trade war. I am having a custom, four sided, small island made (27x36 inches). I knew I had to buy a big piece that is ok. I know I had to get granite cut and add bullnose to  two sides. Price was fair. But to install the piece, on a standalone level cabinet with plywood already installed, was 300 dollars more than other quotes. I didn't use my regular company as they were booked till late January.< /review></record>

Great sandwiches, sweets, and especially their special free tasting of food. It is a wonderful place to pick up something for lunch or dinner if you don't feel like cooking!< /review>< Pics>

The  burger is seriously under the radar.  The most is really well spiced and it's served on real bread, not just a generic bun.< /text>< Pics>

Seriously solid Turkish food. Homemade bread, absolutely fantastic Börek (which consequently runs out), and a great selection of bakhlava (honestly the best I've had in a long time, and definitely the best I've had in the city). Don't leave without a Turkish Delight.</review>

<Review>I really liked this restaurant. It’s nicely decorated and the ambience is great. Pleasant music is playing in the background. The service was very nice and the taste of the food was stellar. I ordered kebab and the sauce was the richest and most savory I have ever tasted on this dish. I wish these guys the best!</Review>< user>

Don't let the Hispanic staff & music put you off.  It's really Persian food cooked & served by friendly staff.  The place is impressively clean, right down to the feet of the kitchen furnishings. Portions are big too.< /Review>

Received a flyer first time calling girl was extremely rude, ghetto and cursed. Instantly cancelled the order, never and will not even think of this place of calling and when the guy comes in with the flyer ill make sure he takes them back. EWW. Really lucky I checked the rating as the food looks horrible. THANKS, YELP.<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I recently placed a order with Presto grill  and ordered the omlett and 3 kobideh lunch specials which are $6.99 for my co-workers.  When I received my order I noticed that I did not get what I ordered. They sent me the wrong meal! The delivery guy was very kind and apologized for the mistake and told me that he would go back to the restaurant and get my order correct.  After waiting another 20 mins I finally received my omlett and kobideh.  I was very dissatisfied with my omlett.  The omlett was black and the vegetables tasted very bad.  The omlett was very salty and it did not look like a egg.  It looked black like the oil they used to make the omlett was dirty.  It was disgusting!! The rice with the kobideh was burnt and did not have any flavor.  I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I called to complain and the girl who answered was very rude!  She sounded very upset because I told her that I was not happy with my meal.  The customer service and the food are very bad.  I don't recommend that anyone order from this restaurant.  I give the food and the service at presto grill 1 star !!!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

I sure did not expect to give Presto Grill such a low rating. But I must because overall the food was not good.

The restaurant is clean and inviting. You can sit outside on the spacious patio or inside at one of the small tables. All unexpected in the middle of the Fabric District. The waitress and cooks were nice and friendly. Service was fast. Prices were good.

The koubideh was not good. The flavor of the meat and the seasonings were bad. It tasted like they had mixed liver in with the meat when it was ground. That is not necessarily bad but in this case was way too much and affected the flavor overall.

I had the Zeresk polo and boneless chicken. It was good. The zeresk were not too sweet and not too sour. The chicken was cooked perfectly. This is hard to find as many places cut the pieces uneven
And they cook unevenly on the grill. So perfect Chicken and zeresk polo.

We took a Falafel sandwich to go. How could they make it bad? I really wanted it to be good. It came with French fries which were great. The French roll was perfect for a sandwich. Onions, pickles and lettuce were very tasty but the falafel was just bad. It didn't taste good at all. I couldn't even eat it.
I was so sad because the bread had so much potential.

Should be 2.5 Stars.<//text>

<Text>Good food. The outdoor seating gives you a good view of the busy street and the ambience of the Los Angeles life. The restroom is clean with neatly placed ornaments, the smell is floral and the floor is dry.
However, even though the outdoor seating a good choice because of the view and the ambience, if you don't like to smell of cigarette smoke, better use the indoor seating. On the inside seating, you'll be treated with a background music of the piped in music (it was Richard Clayderman album that was playing as shown on their wall TV)  and the conversation of the cook, and the flickering shadow of their ceiling fan.
Four 4-seater, three 2-seater tables inside and one 4-seater, four 2-seater tables outdoor.
A good place to enjoy Persian cuisine but don't come very hungry, their service can take some time to arrive.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The food was decent and portion size left something to be desired... my friends & I ordered according to what the owner suggested as he said they didn't have several items that are pictured on their wall. My vegetarian platter had a large salad but it was mostly the white part of the iceberg lettuce and not very many greens. Instead of falafel they tossed a chopped up veggie burger that was purchased from Costco which I also have in my freezer at home. My friends had similar salad platters one with tiny pieces of chicken sprinkled on the top & the other with one skinny kebab. The presentation was nice & we enjoyed our meals until the verbal total was announced. We were shocked to hear our total was $41.00 for our 3 dishes when most of their dishes are advised here for $6.99!!! Not at all what we expect from a hole in the wall diner style restaurant on the east side of DTLA. When we asked for separate checks & the owner didn't want to split them up... we were the only people there so it wasn't like it was an inconvenience. I was going to pay with credit card & have my friends give me cash but then he said their credit card machine wasn't activated yet as they were under new ownership as of 3 weeks ago. When we asked for a break down of the prices he explained that the chicken was an extra $3 & the sides of tahini & hummus that we didn't order were $2 each... he brought them with the platters so naturally we assumed that came with it. We never saw an actual bill & because the items on their printed menu as well as their picture menu on their wall were entirely  different he could just charge what ever he wants. I would have never sat down if I had know I was going to pay $14 for a mediocre veggie salad & soda!!  I paid $6 for a similar platter from here that had these fantastic giant falafel balls & was the reason I came back with my friends. Funny thing is the previous owner was sitting inside the whole time & when I asked if he knew the previous owner he said it was the lady inside who had come by to get some mail.  I'm all about supporting my local businesses & keeping it in the family but I don't appreciate being lied to my face & haggling over prices... we won't be coming back here again unless his mom decides to do a free falafel day!</Text>

<text>My first time going here was a blast. Great customer service and amazing choices to pick from. Small section for board games was fun and it also has a small arcade for some 16 bit fun!

I was really excited because I thought I found another self serving boba like the one in LA. I can't remember the place... Anyway, I cam out disappointed because the tea didn't taste that good nor did the honey boba. The consistency of the boba was too hard and mushy. The strawberry pop tasted a little dry. The atmosphere of the place was good. Looked and felt dirty. But there was games to distract you. I wouldn't come here again. I rather Tpumps for the honey boba</text>

<review>Helpful employees, merchandise in good supply but the store is small, not their fault but it's harder to maintain Covid-19 social distancing. They are very good about limiting the number of people allowed in so that helps. But be aware that sometimes there's a long wait to get in.</review>< pics>

<Review>Amazing above average customer service! Yasmin got up on the ladder and brought down many of the things I wanted to purchase. She offered a wonderful greeting when I enter the store. They told me about the specials and different items on sale. All of my purchases where consisted and made easy 4 a great experience in Bath & Body Works Manhattan Beach store. Thank you to everybody that was working on that day!

< Review>
Went in today to exchange a couple of "Pearberry" products because they started smelling like burnt plastic. Got another couple of different products and even paid a difference. Was in a hurry and didn't notice (till l got home) that the inept employee behind the counter put the same pearberry products back in my bag! How freaking annoying! Waste of money and time! Will be going back to Victoria's Secret to buy my lotions and body spray.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Loyal customer for disinfectant gels and hand soap. I like the change of perfumes according to the seasons and the annual festivals. Too bad this brand is not present in France.

Client fidèle pour les gels désinfectant et savon à main. J’aime le changement des parfums selon les saisons et les fêtes annuelles. Dommage que cette enseigne n’est pas présente en France.</text>

Fairly easy to moderate hike if you begin immediately to the right as soon as you see the creeks at entrance. You can either go up the creek or follow a tiny trail alongside it. Not much water but the sight is beautiful. You can then go up the steep climb using a rope for other interesting trails to the top. Your shoes need to be hiking for better support. If you take the other main trail closest to the creek there’s the steep climb down to the falls, I believe could be dangerous and higher risk for slipping. Know your limitations as your safety should always be top priority. Be careful with poison oak as well</Review>

The hike is fairly easy for a any hiker. There wasn’t much water so there wasn’t any water falls but still worth going. To get to the falls, if you’re going during a fairly dry season, I suggest walking through the creek. It’ll require some climbing over boulders but nothing difficult. It’s such an amazing hike from below as opposed to the top trail. It’s the way less taken. So you can enjoy a nice quiet walk in nature.

Once you get to the “pool” you can climb on one of those rocks to get a different vantage point and see the other “pools”. I was there by myself and it was amazing.

To get back, I suggest going up the path (where the trail would take you down). There’s a rope that you can use to get on the top trail. Then hike the trail down. It goes down from there, so that should make it easier.< /Review>

<response>None</response><text>Beautiful joint..  This time of year it was dry.. Just water puddles!!  I say it’s  intermediate to advanced hiking.. lots of incline walking.. Also parking is street parking.. As for now the main entrance is close and probably has been for sometime since the roads were pretty rocky and beaten..: So street parking is at the fork of the road. If u gotta use the bathroom there is portable near by so when you come u will pass it on ur passenger side.. take advantage of it when y see it lol..<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZqQFsXtscRgnWnmW2mfK5uocMuTugIydJ5UGF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvFGNgYIkxY0h2euFBkkHiI3aQUG3JNv37_0LD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD8IUsdRAwmUZc49KZ2w9D_IA92e5_4aRxzssV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMag1UdxwN5LQYOGi22_RPz_9-bfIZxjZlmt8P8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOR0q10Ih4vpXzIIYmAqgIfFkyrOtohVuPneP_1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3vePdqt4jbm0utNaTHMQhrcNuAQiG61VgiGc5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-JE92clawhmgxNNhj9jlwoA9EkNTdcUr9GQXH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSl-tEUO0fF6gaSEikxYh_Ac7Qrdw8DiYkOMyl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJ7lFILzJro18efeOKy02x16tgG3U8pBtcgAR2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7_E4taMk2e6_ptwrvCy7piRWERlqdRIirlNKh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><user_name>Tiphlizs VP</user_name><GmapID>0x80e96b507e66a3a9:0xb735a6230810d11f</GmapID></record>

One of the best hikes I've had. Mission Creek is energizing and beautiful. If you have it in you follow the creek upwards and you will come across more waterfalls. I started at Inspiration Point Trailhead and followed Mission Creek upwards. Sometimes you have to go around the creek because of the lack of access. I would grade the hike moderate to challenging.< /review>

Really fun hike. I agree with the other reviewers it can be a little confusing to find. I think your best bet is to hike up the creek once the trail initially crosses it, then you will come to the falls. There are a few other side trails that will get you to the falls but they include a pretty steep down hike into the creek.<//Text>

<review>I have hiked this trail every year since my youth.  There are numerous side trails that split off and go deeper into the back country.  The creeks gets fairly pumping after a good rain.  For the most part Santa Barbara exists in drought however so this is rare.  The parking is a mess, but well worth it.  This hike is a 2 out of 5 in difficulty.  There are some 4 out of 5 trails that end in cliff face climbs too.  There is something for everyone here, bring the whole family.</review>< pics>

<review>Gorgeous hike! Apparently there hasn't been any water on the falls for the past couple of years do to drought conditions, but we went after a couple of rainy days and the water was flowing and it was beautiful! The hike up was a but of a challenge because we had to walk across rocks/boulders in the water. I would recommend a waterproof bag for phones and shoes that can get wet! I would've enjoyed myself a bit more if I wasn't so worried about falling in the water and ruining my phone!<//review>< pictures>

Had water in March after all the rainy days. easy to go. definitely consider visiting if you live in Santa Barbara. the way separates from inspiration point trail at the creek. you should stay near the creek and go upstream. has a little bit of bouldering but you should be fine. water was cold but definitely worth the fun! I loved it. take a camera and take nice pictures.<//Review>

<Review>This is a fun place to go to when you want to just get away and go for a walk. The trail is alright and the falls are usually partially dry, at least whenever I've gone, however if you do manage to get far enough up the falls you can find some flowing water. I would recommend going with someone who already knows the trails, because like someone else said below, the trails are slightly confusing. You can still figure it out on your own though if you like exploring.</Review><name>Matthew<//name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very nice walk. It climbs a bit;) take the dirt path to the left for access to the river. No cuckoo on this path. You can have fun going up the river. Plan to put your feet in the water. Good hiking for those who want to go around it climbs.

(Original)
Très belle promenade. Ça grimpe un peu ;) prendre le sentier en terre à gauche pour l'accès à la rivière. Pas de poucette sur ce chemin. On peut s'amuser à remonter la rivière. Prévoir de mettre les pieds dans l'eau.  Bonne randonnée pour ceux qui veulent faire le tour ça grimpe.</Text>< user_id>

<Text>Customer service 8/10 -little pushy

Timeliness 3/10 -took way too long

Quality 3/10 -missed a lot of areas and flat out didn't clean other areas.

I went here on a whim trying to kill time. Only 1 person washed my car. This caused the car wash to take 1hr and 45min. I was not content with this. Also upon inspection (I have rain guards on my windows) the guy who cleaned my car didn't even roll down the windows so once the car was dried there was about 2.5inches on every window of dirt at the top. Plus he didn't clean my exhaust pipes at all. Didn't clean my rims.

Now I will say, it was about 30$ for a wash and spray wax which was very good. It was authentically 100% hand washed, very glad about that. Lastly the customer service was very good.

Be careful though! If you have a lowered car they will not be able to accommodate you in the regular manner of cleaning. You will be stuck with 1 person eating it on the side of the building.
This is what happened to me.

If I was able to maintain regularity for the facility I would have had about 6 people wash my car at the same time and saved a lot of time.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Good guys here. A new staff member cleaned my car, he was still learning because I noticed it was still a bit dirty when driving home. I called them and the manager and he was great about it. He asked me to come back in so they could clean it properly. They did a great job. Very good management style to acknowledge a mishap and offer an immediate solution. Much appreciated.</text>< Response>

< Review>
Specifically asked them not to use armor-all on my seats because it messes with my leather interior. Specifically asked for a vacuum. The good news is, they didn't use armor-all on my upholstery. The bad news is they didn't vacuum at all, AND didn't bother to remove the pollen and bird poo from the exterior of my all black car. It's not that hard to miss. I've had better service from the automated car wash just a few blocks south of this place.<//Review>

Got in my vehicle and none of the interior was cleaned. Had to have the guy come back out to clean the interior. The floor boards were half vacummed and I had to put my floor mats back in the proper places. Had an appointment to go to when I got to my appointment I checked my 3rd row floor board and it was not even vacuumed at all. Took my car back so that they could vacuum it properly.  The manager did not have anything to say about the situation in fact he didnt even bother to give an apology.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c32fd2844edb4b:0x8e243d4516a55c7f< /gmap_id>< username>

The wash wasn't that expensive. From a distance the car looked exceptional, but once I parked I noticed their were a bunch of small smudges that could have been wiped off easily with a rag. This would have made me give the place at least 3 stars. The reason I gave 1 star is because while driving I noticed that the rear view mirror case was knocked loose from the inside cleaning. My car is relatively new so it didn't fall by accident. Only go here if you have time to expect the wash and any damages.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c32fd2844edb4b:0x8e243d4516a55c7f< /gmap_id>< Resp>

<text>Worst customer service;  untrustworthy employees;  manager would refuse to help when my belonging was missing; they take stuff and didn't put it back and then they do not want to do anything;  the manager is very argumentive; the car wash is not even good.</text></record></dataset><record>

The staff is super friendly, the hibiscus tea is delicious, and it's pretty quick service!< /Text>< pictures>

After checking the reviews, this place had some good ones, so I checked it out. I ordered 4 tacos and a drink and it came out to and little over $15. It's pretty pricey for what you get but overall the food was pretty good. Not good enough to make me come back, but I had no complaints about it. There are not a ton of good Taquerias in Santa Cruz and this one seemed like the best they had to offer.< /text>

They have the best enchilada sauce. It has a deep rich smokey flavor. I randomly picked this restaurant while in town on business and I am glad I did. I had the 49er burrito with threaded chicken and it was excellent ad a very reasonable price.< /review>

<user_name>Kapecknick< /user_name><text>food was good, portions  were smaller than in the pictures. food came out fast. however, the owner was  rude  when asking for a cup of ice, saying that they couldn't take in orders. they close 11:45 pm and we were just finishing our food up at 11:09pm when they flickered the lights on and off, was quite  rude. I am aware that they were getting ready to close and go home, so I dont take that much offense but I did feel that was quite rude as we were just about to get up and leave. food was good though, wouldn't choose to come to this place again though<//text>< UserId.>

And they have been lifesaver during the pandemic. It is so easy to swing by and grab a burrito on my way home and avoid the grocery store and avoid delivery services and indulge in some absolutely perfect comfort food. The super burrito with Al pastor is just phenomenal. The number two combination plate is really great!

Best Burrito in town (including the veggie burrito). Worth the drive across town. The service is also very good. I'm white and can't speak any spanish, but they still are attentive to my order and so friendly. Also get the horchata,  you won't be disappointed.<//text>

<Text>Disappointed with the fish, shrimp, and ceviche choices. Saw a really great review about their fish tacos so we were excited to try it out while visiting. If you're looking for fish/shrimp tacos served with cabbage, pico de gallo, and a cream sauce this isn't the place. It's served with lettuce with heaping scoop of sour cream and runny guac that completely takes over the fish/shrimp and is super messy. The ceviche looked delicious,  but was super limey and not much else. All that acid tore up my tongue. If there's a next time, I'll stick to the burritos and try the al pastor.<//Text><UserId.>117577708676992947899< /UserId.>< rating>

Workers improperly wearing masks

I ordered from Taqueria Santa Cruz II today and my al pastor burrito was good, but at least 5 people making food had their noses poking out of their masks. The lady behind the counter also had her mask off (eating I think) when I went back to grab hand sanitizer.</Text>

<review>This is specifically for the Soquel Avenue location. This is one of the best taquerias in town and I'm always amazed that it doesn't make the "best of" lists published. The carna asada has SO much flavor. The tacos are delicious and packed full of meat. I'd highly recommend the carne asada tacos, any variety of the super burritos (but especially the shrimp), the cheese enchiladas, and the tostado. Prices are fairly reasonable, but they've gone up lately. Parking is easy to find and the restaurant itself is huge with plenty of tables. They have a salsa bar with amazing pico de gayo and serve fresh chips with every order. There's a selection of Mexican beverages and desserts. The interior is a little worn, and some menu items are pricier than others. Really love this place.<//review><gmap_id>0x808e401f20b179af:0xc63f5a798f88d436</gmap_id><Rate>4< /Rate>< Time>

I was not impressed with the food and they Forgot salsa to give us salsa, I'm not quite sure if nowadays you have to ask for that was Mexican but I think that that would have been a given🤔

The whole scene to pick up food during covid-19 was a cluster! They only had two people working at the register and it definitely was not enough! they were very efficient at making the food, but they did not have it an efficient system at Distributing it ...
There were orders piling up
there were people coming in for doordash
there were people coming into put in their orders
there are people coming in to pick up their orders
oh, there was no social distancing Norm that was adhered to.
Which side of me extremely because it's my closest taqueria and I'm newer to this area the neighborhood I was looking forward to hit a homerun and having my new fav... however I will not visit them again until covid-19 is over or new Protocols are initiated because I did not feel comfortable in their entrance space< /review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Reading these reviews I have come to the following conclusions:
1. This place has excellent tacos. Order them.
2. Get the Al Pastor as your meat choice.
3. Don't order veggie here. (Or at any taqueria really. I mean c'mon.)
4. If you're acting privileged you will be treated accordingly. Smile and be respectful.
5. Be prepared to spend a little more than you'd like, but the Al Pastor tacos will make you glad you did.
6. If all else fails order the soup. The soup is the best thing on the menu.
7. Whatever you order get it to go, make sure to check it over before you leave, like any thinking person would.

Best Carnitas anywhere. Consistent, quality food at very reasonable prices. I've tried every taqueria in Santa Cruz, by far the best.< /Text>

Food is always good and fast, but I've had some issues with consistency in the preparation. Just have to be specific about how you want it. Still my favorite pastor and taqueria in Santa Cruz< /text>

One of the best in Santa Cruz. Salsa bar is proper. Burritos big and tasty. Quick service. Couple years of consistently good eats! Great area of town for locals and tourists.</text>

One of the best tasting burritos I ever had. Third time here and I had a breakfast burrito the first time and that tasted great just like the chicken and steak burritos, very filling and full of flavor.</review>

<text>One of the best casual Mexican food places in the area! Check out their menu and consider expanding your order into items beyond your norm - they serve up good food at reasonable prices top to bottom. Open relatively late for Santa Cruz which surprisingly has very few options open beyond 10 or 11 PM.</text><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808e401f20b179af:0xc63f5a798f88d436<//gmap_id>< user_id>

Wouldn’t recommend this taqueria. They are always messing up on my orders and still get mad because I don’t say bye through the phone. There are better taquerias out in Santa Cruz.that take orders in and out without getting mad and still treat you with a smile.gave the burrito to my dog.</Review>

If you like "Taqueria " style food, this place is passable.  There is nothing really wrong with it. It just isn't anything special.

There are so many other better choices for Mexican food in Santa Cruz.< /Text>

Only 1 start just because the food was good but the service wasnt welcoming very rude. Ordered a soda and got horchata and then I went to go get a refill and the lady says" $1 dollar refill cant u read" huh which it did say $1 refill but on the soda machines on the other wall. So then on my way out I top my cup off with ice same lady says " $1 refills apply every time" rudely I replied back" for ice its $1 " then walked out</text>

<rate>3< /rate><review>The meat here is pretty tasty and well seasoned.  I liked the cabeza, but wasn't a fan of their asada.  I personally prefer bigger pieces of asada, with some more char to it.  The avocado salsa was good.  The agua fresca I had was too sweet for me.  Chips are ok.</review>< Pictures>

Such a great place to sit in and have a meal with someone or even alone. The staff here are always helpful and friendly (even during crazy busy lunch hour😉) The shrimp cocktail is my son's favorite all time order and I like the regular bean and cheese burritos.👍👍👍👍</review>

First time we loved the Cabeza tacos and the second time the meat was so nasty that we didn't finish it... we spent 60 dollars on food and it was a waste of money< /review>

<review>Best shredded pork you'll have in the central coast. I'm not kidding. $10 ish for lunch unless you skip the rice and beans. free chips and salsa IF you buy food. seating is hard because it was a Foster's Freezer for a long time. needs to be remodeled for 1-2 seaters and the lunch crowd.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><rating>5<//rating>< Time>

Great food, good prices, friendly staff, and quick service. They are not greedy with their proportions. Must try their green salsa, it's delicious.</text>

<review>Prices are high and the food is nothing special.  Reminded me of a school cafeteria.  The salsa bar was horrid, and the dining room was very dirty (I should have walked out as soon as i saw the ripped benches, but the family was hungry.)  The chips were good, but again, the salsa was not.  3 adults and 4 kids ate for $80!!!  We go to taqueria's in San Jose with better food and cost a fraction of what we paid here.  We should have driven back over the mountian.</review><Date>1557507157113<//Date>< response>

<review>Gave this place a few different attempts but I've decided to just let this place fall off my list of decent local taqueria joints.
First time they messed my order up. Second time there carne asada super nachos were unimpressive.</review></record>

The food is decent. The service is lacking. They're open late, and that's the biggest selling point. There are better options for Mexican in Santa Cruz.< /text>

The food is delicious, you get good portions. The food deserves a 5. I gave an overal 3 because atleast 4 to 5 staff members sat at a table in the back talking when the tables where not clean and the place is ran down.</Text>

<userid>118437468570261490683< /userid><Text>Arguably, one of the best Mexican joints in all of Santa Cruz. I never had a bad experience here. Food is great for its price. What really helps this place stand out is its "Carne en su jugo", a beef stew served with avocado, beans, and a delicious broth. I enjoy savoring it's succulent flavor and with spicy foods, even better. Typically, I put some chili peppers with my stew. Overall, a great place to get some delicious Mexican food.<//Text></record>

<Review>Really good tacos and speedy service! These guys have a really big selection of meats, and the tacos are relatively inexpensive. The atmosphere of the restaurant is kind of bland, and the salsa bar is always pretty messy, which is why I give 4 stars.</Review>< pictures>

Best carne en su jugo that I've had from a taqueria! I'm always satisfied after getting food here. I also love that they are open late most days. Lines get long during lunch and dinner hours, but I say it's worth the wait.< /Text>

<Text>The food was not that great especially the whole fried fish. It wasn't seasoned at all and it had a bad after taste. The tacos were nothing special either. I wouldn't recommend to go here unless you don't have any better place to go around.< /Text><gmapID>0x808e401f20b179af:0xc63f5a798f88d436</gmapID>< response>

Quality taqueria food, al pastor done right, spacious, normally delicious veggie burritos, fairly consistent across the board. Front end service is pretty good, but the people who bring the food are not so nice at all. Makes me feel unwelcome.<//text>

Carne asada - grilled flank steak is actually crisp and grilled. Unlike other restaurants that cook their meat, these guys give it an authentic backyard grill taste.<//Text>

On sunny days I hit Al Pastor and Birria tacos. On rainy days I hit the Carne en su Jugo. On bad days I hit a Michelada. All three are game changers if you haven’t tried them. Great joint... especially for carnivores.</Text>

The service can be a little surly and gruff, but the food is fantastic. Taqueria Santa Cruz has some favorites that you just can't get in other taquerias, like birria (bbq goat), carne en su jugo (beef soup), and camarones en mojo de ajo (shrimp in garlic sauce). They could be a little less stingy with their chips (you only get a tiny bag with your meal) but their salsas are delicious.</text>

Lackluster service, worst vegetarian burrito I have ever had, inflated prices, gossipy environment and last time I went I found a pebble in my burrito. They replaced it but the new burrito was mostly inedible.

To be more clear, my second or third time coming to this restaurant, the woman at the cash register, who was already very unfriendly, got angry because I asked a man behind me for change so I wouldn't have to break my last twenty. He was more than happy to supply the change but she acted like I was pan handling and told me if I ever do that again she would kick me out and I would be persona non grata. I made a review highlighting her treatment of me that day, as well as previous times where her attitude was equally unkind.

I made the mistake of going in one final time after a late night work out. I ordered the tripas burrito. I tried to be friendly and ask her how she was and I honestly asked if she had seen my review. She said she had.  I was feeling incredibly gracious and even apologized for posting it. She said it was fine and that people were even coming in telling her how great she was because of it. I was genuinely happy she was able to receive positively because of my review.

I left with my daughter and I' s food. I got inside my vehicle, took a bite and bit down on a huge pebble, and what appeared to be pieces of rocks. I brought back the burrito and asked her sincerely if it was retribution for the review I wrote. She said she was insulted by my inquiry. She said that it was normal for tripas burritos to have pebbles in them. She refused to refund my money and offered a replacement burrito.

Again, I made the mistake of going along instead of insisting on a refund. This time I chose a vegetarian burrito, hoping it would be pebble free. I even kept glancing at the guys making it. It was the worst burrito I had ever tasted. Maybe some folks like feta and lettuce galore in their burrito but not me! It got tossed, even though I normally don't waste food.

As an empath and  single mom of three, I feel everything deeply. Kindness and lack thereof. In a way, the unkindness serves me too, because it has taught me deep, tearful  gratitide for kindness and people who choose kindness. This place has taught me deep gratitude for good food (pebble free), good service, and of course, kindness. May we all choose more and more kindness, especially since we all depend on it.

I hope this helps and thank you for reading.< /text>

(Translated by Google) The food is good the only bad thing is the service by one of the cashiers is nothing more than the owner's niece and gives a very bad service since neither the own daughters of the owners attend with an attitude as arrogant as this girl does ... heck before all there must be humility and attention to others very badly by this girl

(Original)
La comida es buena lo único malo es el servicio por parte de una de las cajeras  no es más que la sobrina del dueño y da un muy mal servicio ya  ni las propias hijas de los dueños atienden con una actitud tan arrogante como lo hace esta muchacha ... caray antes que todo debe de existir humildad y atención a los demás muy mal por parte de esta muchacha< /Text>
