<Text>I've used EcoGuard for over a year. I appreciate the friendly, professional and responsive service. They have promptly replied when I had non-scheduled issues such as wasp nests and spring bugs. The products are effective, I have never had to call for a revisit because the treatment did not work. They use both organic and traditional pesticides, both have been effective. I have been completely satisfied with the service and recommend it for others.<//Text>< pictures>

Darion from EcoGuard came to our rescue when we had a serious ant invasion that Ive never experienced before.  I called him on a Sunday morning and he returned our call right away!  He educated us on ants and the treatment was effective.  Very polite and professional. I highly recommend his company.<//Review>

We really loved Gene.  He was beyond professional and courteous yet friendly.  He was also fast but extremely thorough.
He also went out of his way to help us with a couple of special problem areas...
... AND to thank us for our business, which I can’t recall any other technician doing.< /Text>

The essents of oils used are so much better than the stinky poisons other companies use.< /Review>< pictures>

I have used EcoGaurd/North American Pest for over 2 years. Aaron has been our tech regularly for over a year now at my request. He always remembers us, our regular pest issues and he is very nice and professional. I have had him come out more than once a week on a few occasions because of a wasp issue I had in summer 2020. (I blame 2020). He comes at the drop of hat every time. I’m sure the other techs are equally as good though. The office is easy to get a hold of and the staff is very nice.  In Short, I highly recommend EcoGaurd.</review>

Enrique with eco guard was great. He was on time and responsive and let me know 30 mins before hand that he was on his way. He was very professional and communicated well about the problem we were having giving me all of my options. My friend recommended this pest control company and I would recommend them to my friends as well. A plus</text>

<Review>We called EcoGuard a month ago because of a  horrible ant infestation in our kitchen.  Mike, the technician, has been very helpful, having to return several times to  reapply the bait for the ants.  But finally so far they are gone.  We have signed up for their regular service now and are very pleased.  They even sweep the cobwebs outside under the eaves!

<rating>5<//rating><text>We met both the Area Sales Mgr, Austin & the Technician, Nick.  Nick was everything Austin had expressed about all their technicians.  Nick was substituting for Daniel.  My Husband & I met with Nick.  He was so patient with all our questions & took his time and explained the world of wasp.  We have had so many pest mgmt cos serviced our homes in Roseville, Benicia, Martinez, & Daly City.  We had a local Roseville service that was unfortunately acquired by a reputable large company that gave us the personal custom services we needed for our home.  We are happy to have made the change to EcoGuard & We Thank Austin for ringing our door bell.  We are feeling very about our switch to EcoGuard & strongly believe it's not just a honeymoon period with them.  We developed a sense of trust especially with Nick.  He inspected our property and told us we did not need to add mosquito service due to the location of our home.  Thank You Austin & especially Nick.  We look forward to meeting our regular technician Daniel.< /text>< pics>

The worst thing you could put in your car is Arco Gas. If you want your car to stay in shape you should be using shell. Acro doesn't filter their gas like shell.</Review>

This company is a life saver! My fiancé and I moved from Oklahoma City, OK to Lancaster,CA. We initially didn’t think we would need assistance but when we realized we would, Jet Movers came in and saved the day! They were able to schedule us a time and worked with our date! They offered great service and are really affordable. I was stressed and worried how and if we were going to be able to find help unloading because I have asthma and a heart condition, but now I am so relieved and a weight as been lifted off my shoulders. THANK YOU JET MOVERS!!!</text>

Rafael, Mayo, & Carlos did an amazing job. They went above and beyond. I had a lot of things like lamps and smaller items that I wasn’t sure how to pack, and they packed them for me with great care. I had several huge items that needed to be disassembled to move out/in and they reassembled them when we arrived at the new house. They also had to move things up and down a steep flight of stairs, and through super tight corners and they never scratched the wall or anything. They made what would have been a super stressful move, into an easy, quick and safe experience. Thanks again guys!<//Text>

Amazing company! Everything was a breeze from start to finish. Reasonable quote easy scheduling they were on time! Very well mannered and careful with our property. The owner even called to check on us a few days later and make sure we were happy with everything. This is the first time I’ve ever hired movers and didn’t have anything broken or stolen! If I ever have to do a move again Jet Movers is who I’m calling.</review>

Rafael , Ericson and Jose were very professional and made my move one of the easiest I have ever had. They were on time , efficient and worked quickly. All my items were wrapped up well. I moved out of a 1 bed apartment to a spot 30 miles away and had 2 stops and everything was done within 2.5 hours.< /text>

They showed up 2 hours after my call, within the anticipated time frame. They were able to work with my special situation (lots of people in and out of the house), and managed to do the entire house in one trip. Incredible! They also helped to disassemble/reassemble furniture and large appliances (I would have broken the fridge if I had tried to take it apart or put it back together). They came with additional supplies like dollies, blankets, tape, boxes, which was helpful to protect my more expensive/large items. They were professional, efficient, and excellent movers. The cost of moving a 3 bedroom house to another 3 bedroom house in under 6 hours... invaluable. If I were moving again in the near future (I hope not), I would call this exact team again.

What do you do when you are half way around the other side of the world and given only 2 days notice that you have to move your furniture out of a house where some friends have kindly been storing it for you? Firstly, you freak out. Then you call Jet Movers LA and PODS. By some miracle, both where able to provide the service required at short notice, and via email I worked with Fernando from Jet Movers to plan a load-in, so I'd be able to access my personal things when visiting the storage facility in the future. I was definitely nervous when sending the payment in advance but after looking at all of their stellar Google reviews I gained some peace of mind. I needn't have worried at all. They did the work in great time, without a hitch and were 100% trustworthy. Not only that but the communication was fantastic and Fernando is simply a great guy. Best movers in LA I've used so far. Thanks to your entire team! Happy to be having a deeper sleep tonight knowing my stuff is safe.</Review>

They were half an hour late, took 2 hours to do the job, and they charged me for 3 hours. They broke half of everything they touched. I watched them, 4 times, knock things over that shattered on the ground, and instead of picking anything up they would just turn and stare at me, dumbfounded. They never apologized or even admitted to anything. They didn't even help clean up anything that they broke. Some of it was valuable and antique. And that's just the things I saw them break. We're still uncovering things that they either pretended not to break or tried to hide. Many things that weren't broken have been scratched to the point that the paint has come off. I'm appalled by the way my things were treated by these criminals.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Rafael, Pedro, and Erickson were awesome! They successfully moved all of my belonging from one house to another miles away from each other. They carried numerous things up and down several sets of stairs (including large, bulk items) and nothing broke. Truly thankful for them. Price very reasonable to for manual labor. Highly recommend Jet Movers for your next move!< /Review>

OMG!  This Moving Company is the Absolute Best! They were on Time & so Fast! The men were very respectful & extremely careful with my belongings. They kept their word & did not go over budget. Fernando who booked the move has a 24kt Voice & Fingers Like Lightening when booking your move. He is so efficient & reassuring! This is the Most Honest Moving Company I have Ever Dealt with. You will Not be disappointed. Amazing Service & Professionalism! Thank You Jet Movers for making my move painless & great! Forever grateful Ramona M. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🙏😘</Review>

<Review>I inherited my late mother's dining room set with other things. When they arrived to pick up the furniture they were very careful to pack this to make sure no scratches get on the furniture when loaded in the truck. When they delivered they unpacked and setup everything in it's place. I had a large painting they even hung on the wall for me. Was very pleased and everything and the service was superb! I would definitely use them again if there is ever a need.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1572307143417, 'text': 'Thank you D !!!!!'}<//response>< gmapID>

on August 27, Jet movers manager Fernando offered a contract for shipping items from my 1 bedroom apt worth $400 as flat rate without time bound. But when movers came in, I was disappointed. they started putting a counter offer and argument stating it will take more than 4 hours and asking for an additional 1.5 hours @ $120 and they tried to get more money , unlike stated in the original offer.  One of the crew member, spoke to us offline stating the person who is arguing is trying to loot money.  As the conversation went nowhere. with disappointment,  we called the manager and manager Fernando backed off and sided with the new contract. so, we ended the contract and asked them to leave and  we found a better one and he moved within two hours in the same day at a lesser price.  we gave the people the additional tip to match $400 which was originally agreed. This is not a fake review.. incident happened on 9/5. Please reach out for the details.<//Text>

{'time': 1567725399684, 'text': 'okay lets start off by saying that this persons estimate never took place at our business location, NOR was the first initial phone call.\n\nMr. Shan KC might of contacted and asked for a moving estimate but as state licensed company in California, estimates are done before the move can be conducted. Mr. Shan asked our guys to move 8 Pieces of furniture and wanted to be quoted. Our rep Fernando proceeded to explain that he would need the team to inspect the move before anything can be done. On the behave of our Crew members "stealing"  I find that very hard to believe as we are a 5 team crew. Me,Fernando,Rafael,Erikson,& Pedro, no one steals from anyone here let alone our customers.\n\nIf you had a flat rate move for $400 their would of been a signed agreement stating so, "in paper"\n\nnow that you understand this I want to say sorry for your horrible experience but our company values our work and we know the worth of our profession, so no we wont work for free or for any other conditions that doesn\'t  fit our business policy.\n\nI ask for google to remove this review as it does not fit their google policies and also because their was no signed or written contract stating a "$400" flat rate move. The problem wasn\'t that we didn\'t want to do the job, because we had other jobs that day.... the problem was that you lied and didn\'t tell us about what was really going on with your situation which is understandable especially in our work field. But this doesn\'t mean we are untitled to move your stuff at any cost you\'d like. DO IT YOUR SELF OR FIND SOMEONE ELSE, is our motto here.\n\nMe and my Rep Fernando have ask you kindly to remove your review, and I hope you actually do because reviews affect our business.\n\nThank YOU\n-The Jet Movers Team'}< /Resp>

Jet Movers saved me the time and energy of trying to move my own furniture and boxes from LA to my new condo in San Diego . The team showed up on time and ready to work. Erickson and Rafa made sure my TV and other expensive items were properly wrapped and packed for safe travel which gave me peace of mind . The owner , Kevin, was fully responsive to my questions and concerns throughout the entire process and made a stressful event much easier for me . Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend them to anybody else looking for moving assistance.</review>

Jet Movers made my moving day from something I was dreading into something that I wouldn’t mind doing again. They were on time and took very good care of all my fragile belongs without me having to lift a finger. If you are stressed about moving don’t hesitate to call Jet Movers as they will take care of all your needs and belongings.< /Review>

Rafael, Erikson and Hassan were great! I received a confirmation call the morning of my move and they showed up exactly when they said they would. I was only moving a 1 bedroom, 2.5 miles away, and was on a fairly tight budget. I needed the loading and unloading to happen in 2 hours or else face additional charges.  I was ready when they arrived and they were quick, friendly & professional. The hourly rate is the only reason I’m giving 4 stars. For my fairly easy move, I thought the rate was a bit expensive as I had to pay an additional hour for travel time which did not add up to a whole extra hour.< /Text>

These guys are great! The care about your stuff and they work REALLY hard. They moved a lot for me and packed my items with a lot of protection so that there were no scratches or dings. I can't recommend them highly enough!<//Review>

<time>1622326767274</time><Review>I schedule an appointment for 6:00pm after 11:26am ad Mitchell responded to my disputed claim.
Where he lied was that I never called to cancel about 30 minutes later.  He also lied that I provided my credit card information, which is when the receptionist provides cancelation details. '
They had my credit card on file from 7 months prior and never had stated anything about a cancelation fee when I called, or I wouldn't have booked an appointment.
I can respect a cancelation fee for the employees, but without mentioning it to me when booking an appointment, and me trying to be respectful and cancel within 30 minutes to an hour of my initial call that was 6 hours ahead of the appointment. I think you should read a book up respecting your customers because I will forever tell every person I talk to about massage to avoid your location and your competition .02 miles away would be a better choice.< /Review>< username>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I was surprised/impressed at the overall quality of experience at Massage Heights. This was a comprehensive massage, they go so far as to tailor to your specific needs, giving massage "therapy" a new meaning for me. This was an unbelievably clean establishment with friendly interactions from start to finish. If you are going for the first time, ask for HANNAH, not only was she a great massage therapist but very nice to interact with and created a comfortable environment. Most of the massages I've had left bruises but this was above and beyond no pain what soever. This so far has been the most superior massage experience I've had. Highly recommend. Also there ample parking. 2 thumbs up.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I have been coming here for over 3 years. When my favorite massage therapist left it took a few tries before I found the right fit.

Thank goodness I found Hannah! She gives the BEST deep tissue massage. She is great at her job and is the nicest human you will ever meet. I always look forward to our monthly sessions.

If you haven't been satisfied with deep tissue massage you've received in the past, look no further. Book an appointment with Hannah today!<//review><rating>5< /rating>< Date>

Travis is amazing! I’m a teacher who had to make the switch to online learning, this sending me to hours and hours of video calls and meetings... I don’t think I’ve ever sat this much in my life! My back was killing me and I couldn’t wait until some place opened up again... and the Massage Heights did and I was luckily enough to get Travis! For the first time in months, my neck doesn’t hurt! 10/10<//text>

Today was my first time at massage heights and let me tell you their service is phenomenal! From the second I called this morning they got me into an early appointment and talked me through the whole process. My therapists name was Hernan and he was outstanding as well, he was very warm and welcoming and made me laugh as well. Overall a fantastic experience!< /review>

The Massage Heights Location in Irvine is very professional, organized, and has great costumer service! My experience recently with the esthetician Tonya was excellent and the service was so relaxing and she gave me a lot of information about products she used during the facial. I would definitely come back for a facial with Tonya again and i enjoyed the experience here very much !</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>It is a very relaxing and good experience to get a massage. They are able to stretch the muscle in a way that can't be done by yourself, so it kind of loosens you up for a few days, and is a relaxing thing to look forward to. Cera is the person I go to and she is good at doing massages.<//Review>< pics>

I've been taking facials for 20 years. The 1st time facial here was average. The 2nd time I visited I took elevation which was charged. I saw the same lady who did the 1st time facial "Tonya".
When she started the elevation 1st I told her I was feeling burning sensation, the room is super dark so she can't see a thing. She said it's normal. My skin being brown you can't see the effect of a reaction if you don't pay close attention. This elevation elsewhere is done post the facial. Next she choose to start the facial, I felt my skin was bleeding. I asked her to stop and can't take it anymore. So unpaid for facial and elevation. When I mentioned politely about what happened, the lady at the front office asked me to visit elsewhere and that I already signed. This was pretty rude. I was so scared since then that I didn't go anywhere. My friend recommend a place at newport and when I shared my experience she mentioned that the elevation I opted should be done post facial. This place has inexperience staff. And the front office is very rude. You guys I not doing any favor for me, I'm paying and you are giving the services. And if you want a particular race to visit your place, do mention it on a board.</Text>

I’ve been getting regular massages for several years. I recently moved to the area and spent months trying out various expensive spas, and was so glad to finally stumble upon Massage Heights! I was a little skeptical of the membership program to be honest, but it’s actually a great value and cost savings. The location is very clean, nicely decorated and provides a relaxing environment. And even better, the massage therapists are fantastic (Grace is the best!). Plus you get discounts if you want to exceed your monthly massage or even throw in a facial every now and then. Highly recommend this place!< /Text>

I got a massage for my father to surprise him but when I asked how it was he said it was the worst massage he's ever had, and that the therapist didn't even know what he was doing. That might be a bit of a stretch but the point was the therapist wasn't really good at all. Disappointed. Not to mention the price was insane🙄<//Review>

<review>I had the an opportunity this past Saturday to experience the best 60 minutes of my life in a long time.  My boyfriend and I had a couple's massage with Jane and Lewis.   They have MAGIC in their fingers!!  We enjoyed it immensely!! The facility is so tranquil and clean and the staff is professional and very friendly.  We will definitely return!<//review><date>1431628832908<//date>< gmap_id>

<review>This spa salon is very relaxing and aromatherapy is wonderful. I had my 1 hour facial with Tonya and it was outstanding experience as she is a true professional. I loved the form mask it made me feel like I am dipped in a cloud. I would recommend to go after very stressful day of work as it is very relaxing and the staff makes you feel pampered and taking care of.</review><date>1494957447573<//date>< Resp>

<text>I had an incredible massage here with a hot stone and foot scrub.  Wow, I felt incredible when I left.  I can't wait to go back.  I got the foot scrub free for my birthday and the hot stone was discounted from yelp.  The staff is so attentive and the spa is so clean and relaxing.< /text>< gmap_id>

<rate>4</rate><Review>The first time I came here, I had a not-great experience. The girl that did my massage was super chatty and focused on areas I had asked her not to worry about. But, I let them know when I left and they called me and asked me to come back and get a second massage. The 2nd trip was SO GREAT. Quiet, relaxing, perfect pressure. Was thrilled. I still think their monthly program is a bit pricey for what they offer, but I like the location of this place.< /Review>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><review>So far I've paid $360 for two mediocre massages--clearly not a good deal.

Mitchell Simon, the owner/operator of this branch will make every attempt to talk you into buying a membership, but then make it very difficult to cancel.

The only way he will allow anyone to cancel is if you visit him in-person. I've made repeated attempts to cancel over the phone and he refuses.

Even though the contract I signed states that I have 90 days post-cancellation to use my credits, Mitchell lied and told me that I will be unable to use my credits unless I continue paying him $59 a month.

Should I have thought twice about giving this guy my credit card information? Yes, I absolutely should have. Does that mean I should refrain from warning you of making the same mistake? Nope.<//review>< Resp>

My wife and I have been members here for a while, and I want to pay this business back in a small way, so here I am. We alternate between scheduling our massages 5-10 days in advance and booking the day before or the day of our appointment depending on what our work schedules are like and how much stress we are currently experiencing. In any case, the staff is helpful and accommodating. We of course can't count on booking with a specific therapist when we book with so little notice, but luckily every therapist we've met has done an admirable job, and we have never had a bad experience here. This tendency to occasionally book at the last minute has in fact been beneficial, as my wife and I have both met therapists that way that we probably would not have otherwise met, as we both met therapists fairly early on that we were quite happy to continue booking when they are available.

I'd like to specifically compliment three therapists - Scott, Briana, and Hernan. All three are friendly, really know what they are doing, and are responsible for the best massages I've received in my life. All three consistently work extremely hard during their massages, and strive to make sure that the customer's particular needs are met. Much of my work is physical (I do extensive field work as a scientist and work as a SCUBA instructor on the side) so I frequently come in with deep knots, extensive muscle soreness, and heavy tension. With all three of these therapists I've felt like my mind was being read, so intuitively were they able to isolate and dig in to each knot and tense muscle group. All three are also quite strong; I like heavy, hard pressure, particularly in my back and arms, and I have never been disappointed. Scott, Briana, and Hernan - if you see this review, you have a very satisfied customer, and I think you three are awesome!

The operation itself is well-organized and efficient. Booking can be conveniently done over the phone, online, or in person, and I've never failed to receive an emailed reminder before my appointment. The rooms and bedclothes are clean, the music is soft and pleasant, and the general ambiance is quite relaxing. The aromatherapy scents are pleasant without being overpowering, and the lotions used don't seem to leave an unpleasant scent or residue. The owner, Mitchell, also makes it a point to talk with the customers to ensure we are happy and to make us feel welcome and valued.

I look forward to being a patron here for a long time to come!< /Review>

<Review>I enjoy my membership here, like the great ambiance and massage therapists. Have been coming for more than a year now, I had a favorite therapist and felt upset when she left. However now I have Wenzhi and Stephany, both amazing! Nice conversations, relaxing massages, even though a little pricy, I guess we just have to pay for all the good stuff.<//Review>< pictures>

She makes sure to talk to you about your skin beforehand so that she can choose the right product for you during the treatment so nothing stings or burns. I also enjoy that she tells you the type of product she is putting on your face before she does it so you know what she is doing and what to expect. Also, the Dermalogica products are fantastic. I have had no bad side effects after either facial and plan on receiving some more!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It's convenient but a little pricy at times. The first couple of times I was here some of the staff seemed annoyed when I asked for help so I stayed away for a bit. However, my last several visits have been great & one member of the staff, Evan, has been a standout reason. He is polite, friendly, knowledgeable, helpful & patient (I had a lengthy list of items I needed). Bobbi is another staff member who was helpful, friendly & knowledgeable & she knew what I needed when I explained my problem. Recommend.</text>

It's a really good hardware store, but I've lost money at the registers several times. Hopefully, I've broken even with the $5.00 coupons I've earned.<//Text>

Best hardware store in the county. Knowledgeable, pleasant staff. They carry pretty much anything you could need in the way of hardware, paint and houseware items.</text>

< Review>
Interesting store with different buildings, kind of fun, especially the candy store :-). Lots of variety of hardware, paint, tools, plant, plumbing supplies, their fishing section is growing.
Staff are courteous, variety of expertise. Parking is a little tight.</Review>

They have everything, but it sucks that there's two buildings because you have to make two separate transactions I'd you need one item from each building.</text>

Almost anything you need to fix your home can be found in here. Good selection of electrical and plumbing parts. Helpful, knowledgeable folks in red vests. Prices are a little high, but at least you can take on and complete a job with what you can find.< /Text>

This store is always clean and is very centrally located. The staff is always super friendly and very nice. They are very knowledgeable and helpful. The location is very easy to spot from the street as well. I always come here for all my hardware needs when I am visiting or living in humboldt county.</Review>

<text>The bad:  Parking.  But that's Arcata for you.  The staff at this establishment is amazingly friendly and helpful.  It's pretty clear that they have been trained on how to do customer service.  My wife and I live in McKinleyville and we have an Ace Hardware about 5 blocks from our house, we will travel to Arcata just to go here because the customer service is so much better.  It's refreshing to go to a hardware store and not have employees treat you like you're interrupting them.  Thank you Hensel's Ace.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Great service. Inventories stay well-stocked. Knowledgeable employees. Decent prices. They have a haggle sidewalk sale once a year so you can get that one expensive job done you always wanted to do.< /Review>< pics>

I had a question about an item, I was wanting to buy, but the guy I found was talking to someone via his Bluetooth, and asked me to wait... I feel like since I was there in person, instead of sitting on my butt, somewhere, he should have asked the person on the phone to please wait a minute, AND SOLD ME SOMETHING! thanks.</Review>

They stalk people parking in their lot and in the store, and have their cars towed when they find people at nearby businesses.  I understand their dilemma and frustration.  But as a valid customer I should NOT have to answer their probing questions about my car while I am in the store.  I have had them tell me it will be MY fault if my car is accidentally towed.  They are overly paranoid about their spaces to the point it makes me feel unwelcome.  I wish I had better options. I go to Sunny Brae Ace when I can.  They are not much more friendly, but they don't stalk you in the store.<//Text>

This review is for the housewares/candy portion of the store: I was followed around the entire store and felt incredibly uncomfortable as if they thought i was going to steal something. I’m a student and don’t look particularly sketchy, though that shouldn’t matter when it comes to customer service. Extremely terrible shopping experience, particularly in their tiny candy shop area. I couldn’t look at a single thing on the shelf without the cashier walking up and peering over my should repeatedly asking if i was looking for anything in particular. Who is looking for anything particular in the candy section of a hardware store?? Just let me browse please. Super uncomfortable experience. I’ll be taking my business elsewhere.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Got my hair cut by Daisy, the owner, and I have to say I'm very impressed by her work.  A buddy of mine recommended her to me and I drove all the way from San Mateo to see what all the buzz was about.  I'm very picky when it comes to fades and haven't found someone that I want to stick to.  However that changed that I landed in Daisy's magical hands.  Plus the place is super clean, and has a nice ambiance.  Daisy wore her mask the whole time and sanitized her station as soon as she was done.  For less than $20 I came out looking and feeling like a million bucks.  She just added a new regular to her clientele!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1614740352257, 'text': 'Thank you Jose Urbina.'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

My partner and I had a great experience here! I had long hair and wanted a few inches off, as well as adding some long layers. Daisy did an excellent job despite me being a little vague- I'm not the best at hair talk. She was very kind and easy to talk to. My partner is SUPER picky about his hair and has tried many a salon trying to find someone who will listen to his specifications. Once again, Daisy nailed it! I haven't seen him this happy about his hair in a long time. The prices are great and she cut both our hair in 45 minutes. The salon is spacious and full of beautiful plants, which makes it feel very cozy and welcoming. There was hand sanitizer and a roped off section to ensure proper distancing. We'd highly recommend University Hair Care to everyone!<//Review>

University Hair Care is a fantastic place to get a great hair cut at a very reasonable price. Daisy has done a very good job each time I have been there and is quite friendly. You can usually get an appointment on fairly short notice if you call ahead, and they take card for payment which is a plus.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>My friend referred me to this place, so I went there for the first time and I'm so glad I did.  Daisy who happens to be the owner did a superb job!
I went in for two-tone lowlights/ highlights and a layered hair cut... and she nailed both!
I'm very picky about how I want my hair done, but she listened and delivered as I requested.  I'm very pleased and actually surprised that on my first visit to this place I walked out happy.  Even the cost was less than I'm used to paying, so I'm definitely returning.< /Review><Time>1600838755306<//Time></record>

If you think every good salon in Berkeley is overpriced, think again!  Daisy's has had this business  for over a dozen years and I've been coming here for the whole time!! The stylists do a consistently great jobl, it's a professional yet casual atmosphere and has fantastic prices on cuts, colors, and blow dry styles..I would never go anything else ...</Review>

Such an amazing experience every time I go and get my hair cut! Personally I like to choose my hair stylist very carefully since not every hair stylist delivers what he or she promises. Every time I go to this great salon I come out happy and better looking :). Trust me, I highly recommend you give this salon a try and see for yourself<//review>

Best place to get a haircut in Berkeley! Daisy (blonde owner) does a fantastic job EVERY time. I'm a repeat customer now. I recommend calling at least a half hour ahead of time to set up an appointment. Much more attention to detail than the place across the street and the parking lot is now open!< /review>

I’ve been coming to University hair care for over 21years !!! I have japanese thick wavy hair and Daisy knows how to tame my beast Hair !!!
She has been cutting my kids hair since they were not  even born and we still come here ! I used to go to Macy’s in San Francisco’s to get my hair cut but Daisy is the Best with Asian hair and knocks my A line haircut out ! The haircuts and highlights are so reasonable and she is family oriented!!!< /review>

I really didnt like how daisy cut my hair. I asked for a hairline and she didnt even cut the middle part of my hair leaving little sprouts of hair hanging in the front ,she also didnt trim the left side that much leaving the right side much shorter than the left side. I was really disappointed as this was my first time going there.</review>

I found aTLC Animal Clinic by luck when trying to find a Vet for our new puppy.  From my first telephone contact and first visit I was very impressed with the compassion and quality of service from TLC.  Dr. Lee is amazing!   We have ad a few scares and Dr. Lee was compassionate and reassuring when it came to our puppies care and our concerns.  I highly recommend TLC Animal Clinic.<//Review>

<review>My experience with TLC has been amazing. My cat was attacked by a dog and they were the only clinic that was able to take him in immediately! I felt really comfortable with all of their staff and the Dr.’s work healed beautifully all of his hair has now grown back and there isn’t a single trace of a scar :) recently we took our pup in to get flea treatment and meds, AGAIN wonderful customer service and the front desk staff even asked how our cat was doing. This is a wonderful clinic with all-around great staff and pet care. I recommended them to my mom and she has also switched veterinarians and takes her dog there now too. We will continue to bring our pets here for their care :)

Thank you very much from the Sainz family.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1621848469166, 'text': "Hi M.K, thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback!

The Doctor wanted to do xrays, blood tests, etc.for over $500.00 . After explaining I couldn't afford that, the called my other vet for test results from last year. They are a rip off clinic. After getting some pills and the cost of the visit, it was $165.00 . One medication on line was 18 cents a pill. They charged me $45.00 for 20 pills.

<review>Dr. Kim and his staff are amazing. I've taken my pets there for years, trust them completely. Dr. Kim is honest and prices are very reasonable. He's treated my dog for pancreatitis, helped my blocked kitty, my epileptic dog, done eye surgery, dental, ear infections, spay, neuter, helped with my foster pets... so many things! I've never been disappointed or hesitated to leave any of my beloved pets in his care. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a family vet.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Good spot but they dont get the flea med, 3 months $56. Its a bit much, specially when they just walk in and do it without warning of cost. that its more than at petco

Dr. Kim and his staff are always friendly and and helpful as well as the appointment availability is always easy and simple. Gives you options and never up sells in anything.  Great place to go too, I used to go to another vet who was rude and not friendly with people nor pets decided to go to TLC and regret not coming here sooner! Greatly recommended😃< /Text>

Have been taking my "girls" here since they opened over 10 years ago. Dr. Kim, Tammy and the rest of the staff treat my dogs like celebrities every time we go. My basset hound didn't even know she had been spayed. The incision was so small and she never felt any discomfort. Can't say enough good things about them. This is the only review I have ever left for anything, but these folks are the absolute best in every way.</Text>

Dr. Kim and the entire staff at TLC Animal Clinic really care about our beloved pets and us owners as well. I agree 100% with the previous reviews, I've never felt any sort of "upsell" pressure or even hint of a procedure that wasn't absolutely necessary. Their pricing is absolutely affordable and appropriate. I'm moving away soon, but will continue to bring my pets to TLC Animal Clinic! :)</Text>

<Review>Dr. Kim and his staff are very professional, provide quality care and take great care of my fur baby. I wouldn't take my pet anyplace else. I also don't leave feeling as if I'd just been ripped off.< /Review>< rating>

<text>Dr. Kim took his time in examining our 11 year old black Labrador. He was honest and seemed to really care about his patients and owners. There was no pressure in the "up sale" catagory which was great as in the past dealing with up sales can really be costly and not needed at all. Very happy we choose Dr Kim.  We live less than 1 mile from his office.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

On April 28th I took her in for anal glands ext, but noticed a small white discharge as I handed her to the nurse who suggested we take her in and do an ultrasound. After the ultrasound the Dr tells me it is an open Pyometra and RECOMMENDS SURGERY ASAP OR THAT SAME DAY! I was hesitant on a 2nd surgery since she had one in January and felt it was too soon and I also could not afford $800. I left and took her to TWO different vets that weekend for a quote for this type of surgery, but both vets would not give me a price until they confirmed the diagnosis. They both took blood work, ultrasounds, microscopic swab and measured the lining of her uterus and both could not find any sign of Pyometra.
I called TLC today and requested the money back for the visit but what makes me extremely upset is how quickly Dr Kim was willing to operate without thorough examination prior to an invasive procedure as removal of a uterus.
Extremely thankful I did not agree to an UNNECESSARY SURGERY!!!!< /review><Rate>1<//Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user>

Staff is friendly, helpful and are very friendly to the pets that come in. Dr. Kim is gentle when handling your pet(s). Dr. Kim and his staff are professional and show that they care about the health of your pet(s).<//text>

Todd took great care of me. Got me a great deal on a set of cooper tires, answered all my questions, provided great service, quick work, and an all around excellent experience. Will be returning to get my brakes and other work done.< /Text>

You guys fixed one of my tire because it had a puncture by a screw, luckily my tire was saved by patching it at Pep Boys. I’m glad you guys were there to help. **Tip: always use your rewards phone number. I got $5 dollars off because I shop a lot. Thank you!</review>

<Text>Made an appointment...showed up...after 20 minutes of taking calls...he asked me to return the next morning so I could "arrange my schedule for the appointment". Well, I insisted he please get a mechanic to diagnose my oil leaks...after a cursory 2 minute look they told me the leak was transmission fluid (which is read) and not motor oil (which is black)...and said "since we don't transmission work, here are your keys,,,bye"...Wow. It was not a trans issue, it was a camshaft seal and a real oil seal...If you want to waste your precious time, this is the shop for you.<//Text><name>Phyllis Stuart</name>< resp>

I took my vehicle in for oil change new oil filter air filter.I had a door handle that needed to be replaced.I had ordered my door handle ahead of time.The people are very helpful and nice.I took a walk around Pico Blvd.There was a beauty supply store.Lots of different types of restaurants to get a bite at.They were very. busy.Took a little more time than I expected.I would rather have the job done correctly the first time.Pep Boys does and will definitely have your car fixed property.
I trust Pep Boys for my vehicle.< /review>

They been very helpful and friendly. Best value i can get for an oil change in the area without a doubt. Its best to make an apointment and wait, do some shopping at wholefoods or drop off your vehicle and pick it up later. They are very efficient and do a great job every time i've brought my vehicles here. I also got some great deals on a set of new tires and 2 - O2 sensors replaced with in 4 hours of dropping my suv off.

<Review>My Honda Odyssey battery is coming to end of life. I went to Pep Boys at Santa Monica for replacement. I called the store in advance. Todd was so helpful and told me when I should be at the store. Everything was so smooth afterwards. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. Great service ! Ask for Todd next time.<//Review>< user>

Was here today 7/29/20  9am pst. Got 2 new tires and realignment. They lost one of my (custom) tire caps and said they will pay me for a new set once I show the receipt.  I will update this to either a 5 star or 1 star depending on them keeping their word. Fast work and seemed good with friendly sociable staff. Got nothing against them just dont like losing things and not being told. we will see in the next week as I just put in the order for a new set.

Update 8/1/20 : went back and spoke with gus. Very helpful. They reimbursed me after showing proof that I had purchased a new set of tire caps. Will be coming back to this location as I do appreciate when customer service is on point.< /Text>

I go to this Pep Boys for my tires, alignments, oil changes, etc. When I make an appointment for an oil change, they get me in and out quickly. When I have had issues with my tires, like when my indicator light came on today, they quickly got my car up on a rack, checked all my tires thoroughly and finding the issue was low air pressure, filled my tires and got me on the road quickly. I really appreciate the service these guys provide and highly recommend them.< /review>

< Review>
I was charged for work that never got done (got a partial refund), and over the week and a half they had my car they never once updated me on the status once I had called them on it.

I took my car in for, among other things, replacement of my washer fluid pump, which they said they could do.  They later called me with the overall cost which I accepted, and later called me to tell me all work was complete.  I went and paid, got my keys, and tried it out.  The washer fluid pump still didn't work.  All responsible parties had already left for the day, so the next week I come by and confirm - the work never happened.  But they'll keep the car and fix it.  Days go by in which I don't receive any updates, so I call.  No progress.  This happens for a week and a half, when after I have to call yet again, they tell me they can't do the work they charged me for.  But I can get a partial refund.  They then fail to tell me only one person can do refunds or when he'll be in, so when I pick up my car I still have no refund.  It takes another week and a half to handle that, and I still had to pay for some of the 'work' that never really happened.< /Review>

EDITED.  CHANGING TO FROM 2 TO 1 AFTER TRYING TO DO REBATE ONLINE AND FORM WONT ACCEPT NUMBERS.   Won’t be coming back here.  Seems like there is only one person there at all times but never the same person.  They never pick up the phone or call back like they said they would.  Made morning appointment for brake pads and check leaky tire.  Couldn’t get pads from store up the street till next day but didn’t tell me.  Asked them multiple times about the tire on phone, in person and on website appointment details and they acted like I never told them about it.<//Text>

Went in for an oil change they said my car needs a full synthetic that's what the manufacturer recommended they said, I said let me check the owner's manual, nowhere in that manual said full synthetic when I showed them. Also had the GM official site on my phone with all suggested oil for use from owners manual API. Then they told me they don't have any regular oil and they couldn't do oil change. Just a warning to everyone apparently this place only carries full synthetic oil so you can pay the full synthetic high prices.</text>

<Text>My car did not start this morning so I had to get road assistance to jump start it. While they were coming, I called Pep Boys to ask about the battery replacement cost and details. I went there and J.P. was extremely helpful and so nice to me! After leaving, I called back with one follow up question from the gas station and he was just SO HELPFUL AND NICE TO ME!! Thank you so much.< /Text>< pics>

I went in for a part and an oil change and was informed they couldn't work on my car because I didn't pass my smog test. I was trying to explain that this was the reason I came in. The employee then walked out on me in mid conversation. Very rude. I just wanted to understand why they couldn't work on my car.< /Text>

<Review>I was unsure about going to this Pep Boys after reading the reviews. My experience with this location was great. The manager, Michael took really good care of me, and checked on price discounts for the items and services. I was done in less than an hour and they took really good care of my truck.  I will be coming back. Thank you.</Review>< Pics>

While on vacation, my boyfriend had ran over a screw just as we were about to go back home, so we looked up the nearest tire shop and this store was less than a mile from us so we decided to go there, despite the reviews. Biggest mistake. We got there around 2:30 and was told that it would be done around 4 because 2 cars were ahead of us. So we thought okay not bad, but this wait turned into 3.5 hours! We didn't leave until 6! The manager who initially help us was wonderful and very efficient, but I assume he left for the day and left us with super slow workers. There were even people who came after us that got their cars fixed before us. Not one of the employees came to us and gave us updates or an updated estimated wait time and did not get to our car until we literally reminded them that we were still waiting! Eventually when our tire was fixed, 3 hours later, we were not even notified that it was done. Again, we had to go up to them and ask if it was ready and it had been ready for like 15-20 minutes but they didn't think to tell us. The man who helped us was nice and all, but the wait time was absolutely ridiculous and the service was insufficient. Would not recommend if you are in a hurry, but if u want to wait around and be ignored all day, by all means, go to this store.<//text>

<Review>After changing my oil in this shop I discovered they changed my new battery too My car after one day start not working. The police helped me that day to charge  the battery I was in the school parking  lot and other day in the morning my car not working again  I call triple A when they came to charge my battery the guy  say you have to change  your battery because  this is the wrong  one you have in your  car. I was shocked and I asked my self to many questions why what happened My car when I bought the battery  from Costco  3 month ago was fine and everything  OK it's  working. I went to Costco and I take the battery from the car when I open the battery I found out  that The iron part that houses the battery has  disappeared 🤔I think that part maybe was fell by it self from the car . In Costco when the employee see the battery he said  this battery  not from us not from Costco  maybe  some one change  it for you. 😱I can't describe my feelings how and who I am just keep thinking  who did this to me. I am just visit  the oil change shop and the guy  there  he say you have to leave  the  car  for 2- 2.5 hours I said OK but if you finish before  that  time please  give me a call. I went  to the Virginia park after  2 hours I am returned back to the shop  and the guy  said  your  car is ready I was wondering  why he didn't call me but I was in Harry because  I have to pick up my kids.  So I am just ride my car. This was my experience with pop boys.  Oil change shop< /Review></record>

Ruben saved me at 3:57 on Sunday night.  Then Monday morning, he confirmed I had a nail puncture which meant a new tire was needed.  The tire was 3 months old.  Although I went back to where I bought the tire, I will go to THIS Pep Boys next time I need new ones, due to Ruben's kindness.<//review>

I bought four tires from this location over a year ago.  I was encouraged to buy the option to rotate and service the tires every few thousand miles So I did purchase that option.  In January 2016 one of the tires kept losing air so I knew there was nail and I will get a flat tire if don't take care of it so I took the car to them since I bought the tires from this location.  When I told them about the option I had purchased and that one tire must have nail they asked me to wait.  Two hours passed by and no news and my car was still parked in the parking space where I parked.  I went to the desk and asked them and they said they just put air and the tires are fine and my car has been ready.  But nobody told me my car was ready and I sat there for two hours.  I had asked for tire rotation and told them one tire had nail since it kept losing air so I asked them again to please rotate the tire and take the nail out so I won't get flat tire on the freeway and get in a car accident and get injured or die.  So, finally they rotated the tires and took the nail out.  Their service was really bad.  I live in Santa Monica and that is why i went to them.  But I should not go to this location again and I warned my family and friends not to go here.  I had two bad experiences when this place was Discount Tires and after Pep Boys bought it I thought their management and staff has changed so Pep Boys must be better, but no they are as bad as the old Discount Tires.  Very bad customer service and negligence!!!<//Text>

<text>I saw there is only two stars here but I got a flat tire and I think it may be the place like the one near me. This is my first time here and it must be the last time. I changed my tires but they do not go straight after I got it. I'm sure about there may more things to check but they've charged me and must give the car at end  of the day. So I believe they skip some steps and returned my car before they close. I saw the guy was gonna lift my car but his coworker just came and told him something. Then, the guy returned my car. WORST experience ever and they deserved 0 star. DO NOT GO THERE. FIND SOME OTHER PLACES PLEASE</text>< rate>

I made the mistake of getting my oil changed here. When I drove off the lot, my car quickly filled with the smell of burning oil. The engine was completely covered with it. When I drove back to find out what had happened, the mechanic eventually said that he had knocked over the funnel of oil but had not bothered to tell the manager or me. They offered me a discount on return service, but I'll never be back. Any confidence I've ever had in the Pep Boys name is gone.< /review>

I made an appointment for an oil change for 9am and when I showed up they told me it would take 1 to 1.5 hours. Are you kidding me.The oil change itself shouldn't take more then 20 mins. So why have a fancy appointment system if you still have to wait an hour to get your oil change even started.< /Text>< pics>

Kind of disappointed in this place. I went in to get my Lyft inspection. They are pushing me to get tires changed there. Said I would get a small installation discount but it wasn't much. After the inspection the guy forgets to sign it so it wasn't valid and I had to go back. The same guy wasn't at work so they made me wait another two days.< /text>

<rate>1</rate><review>I went here on two occasions. First was for a very slow leak in a tire. No nail, no visible hole location. They dunked the tire and could not find any bubbling. They soaped the tire and nothing... They didn’t know what to do except reseat the tire. They did so thinking it might be some pinhole leak in the tire seal. They did this by gunning up the rim and reseating the tire. Cost $25. Next day tire is flat. I was in another area so I had to take it to another shop where they found the pinhole leak in the tire and actually fixed it. Second visit. Just needed a tire rotation. Had an appointment at 11am but decided to go early (10:30am) to see if they had an open bay and just do what should only take 10-15min at most. I pull up and tell them I’m early to see if they can get me quickly. The guy says no they are full so I say “ok well I’ll come back at my appointment time” he say that I don’t want to do that because he double booked me and if I come back during my actual appointment time that I might wait longer. I say ok I’ll wait. For one whole hour I watch 4 guys move like 90year olds crossing the street. I swear if they went any slower they’d be going backward! No work ethic, no hustle, no pride, nothing.... They didn’t even try to look like they cared. The only real reason I went back this second time was because tire rotations are “free” from a financial obligation. Obviously not free from time spent..... Oh yeah I didn’t get out of there until 11:50! That’s right 1hr20min for something that actually only took then 10min to take care of.  It’s really sad to see people like this... If you don’t take pride in what you do, who will ever take pride in you?  Sad....

Side note: you don’t have to read this but as another example of their laziness.... I was waiting with this older Russian gentleman and he had been there before I got there, and he was getting pissed! He was getting new tires put on and the guy working on his car was probably the slowest guy in the shop. It was incredible how long it was taking this one guy to change these tires. I really felt bad for the customer because you can tell he had been waiting there a while. I was there 1hr20 and I left before the old guy but was finishing up as I drove away.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Prior to Pepboys, this place was a discount tire center.  Great location to get a nail out of your tire or work out some competitive pricing for replacement tires.  Preferred when it was Discount Tire Centers.</review></record>

They think women are stupid when it comes to car care.  They tried to tell me that things were wrong with my car that I knew wasn't the issue because AAA had just told me what my SMALL issue was. I went to Pep Boys because I needed to use my Pep Boys credit card because I had just paid my rent. BEWARE OF THIS LOCATION. THEY ARE NOT HONEST. BAD BUSINESS.<//text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>My car stalled in Santa Monica and this was the Pepboys close to have my car towed. First, I was told the battery needs replacing.  Then, I called to find out about the ETA of it getting fixed and  I was told that it is actually my Starter and Gasket Manifold needs to be replaced. After they performed the service, I called to find out the status (I didn't even get an e-mail or call if it was done) I was told my car is ready and it is fine (after calling the prior day to make sure everything was ok).  I drive off and I notice that my engine light came on.  So, I drive back and told the manager that my engine light came on and it was never on before.  They pull out a code that suggest a knock on the engine.  They tested the battery and alternator.  The manager says I need an alternator.  I wanted my local Pepboys to do it.  So, I drive home very nervous that my car might stop in the middle of the freeway due to the possibility of getting stalled again.  I go to my local Pepboys and replaced the alternator and I still get the code PO325 Knock sensor.  After spending almost a grand, my car has not been fixed!  Now, I wonder if they did the correct diagnostics.  I'm hesitant to come to this place again.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1479234540129, 'text': 'We are sorry you had that kind of experience and appreciate your feedback.

<Text>My friend Vern told me how good this place is and I didn't believe him. From the front it looked like one of the newer chain pizza parlors. So I didn't consider going there. Wow, Vern was really right and I was really wrong. I mean really wrong! We've ordered there four or five times now and every time it's been perfect. Perfect! Perfect I tell you!  And you don't have to drive 40 miles to Fresno. They aren't fast but patience is a virtue and is rewarded. I would drive the forty miles to Mama Mia's in Fresno but the wife won't, so Pizza Factory is the marriage middle ground. Try it you'll like it it.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80944988b3f75311:0xe0a7bc5d7f013491<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Prather Pizza Factory. Had a 45 minute wait with horrible service. Waited 7 minutes with the person in front of us ordering several orders, then once that is done the to go order was taken before us, 3 phone orders then us. Not a very welcoming place for some good pizza. Name taken for the order was wrong. For service that’s normally good it wasn’t today and for that 25 minute wait time turning into 45 minute wait might as well have driven down to Clovis and gone to Me N Ed’s. 2 stars for the pizza. Not sure if we came on the wrong day at the wrong time because everyone behind the counter sure seem to be enjoying their time not really minding their customers. Restrooms were nasty to use and surprised this place hasn’t shut down for having the second door locked during business hours, dirty business that needs cleaning with also a fresh inviting look.</Review>

< Review>
Ordered a large one topping sausage pizza and told them this was my first time there. Instead of putting on extra sausage, they hardly put any on. Some slices only had one small piece of sauage, and the total was $20.35. This is what happens when a restaurant doesn't have a competitor nearby.< /Review>

I celebrated my graduation last night in this fine place. I am glad to say that we enjoyed a superb evening and the venue was indeed one of the reasons for that strong evening. The stuff  cooperated in a gorgeous way, the cuisine was great and my guests were so  overjoyed. We shall absolutely return for more events. Thank you very much.< /Text>

The pizza was good.....but. They had the order wrong. The didn't add what we asked for and didn't take off what we didn't want on the pizza. This isn't the first time time this has happened. And yes I had them repeat our order.< /review>

<Text>We had a very pleasant dinner at Running Goose. The environment is very cozy and they have outside seats. Everything tastes very good, especially the salad. We don't know which one to choose and the girl recommended an awesome one! My friend and I enjoyed the dinner very much, the waitress is much helpful, I'll return to this place when visiting LA again!</Text>< pictures>

Completley disgusted. I am local who tries to always come back amd support this business. Today was enough. The men working at the time were yelling at each other, cussing at each other, etc. My food comes out and the guy literally throws my food on the counter with no other words. Rude, disrespectful, people, I'm sorry I gave them another chance.</text>

<text>Staff is very rude. Place is dirty. You pay on average $45 a meal and have to bus your own table. The last time I went there I waiting 1hr and 10 min for my pizza because they FORGOT to make it twice..

<review>The pizza was bland and greasy. The restaurant was dirty, the bathrooms were gross. The service was slow. The arcade games were over priced. The only positives were the kid behind the counter was nice and they put fresh veggies on the pizza. They were raw, but they were at least fresh.< /review>< Pics>

<text>Friendly staff! Very clean facility and they know how to make a great pie!  Hand tossed, the bread sticks are great as are the wings.

Stop on by and tell them Smitty sent you... they will stare at you and act like they don't know who I am.. they kind of don't but it would trip them out a little.</text>< pictures>

Pizza was excellent. That's the only reason for the 3 stars. Location, nor the tables were clean. There was a long wait to place order, then it was a long wait to get the food.< /text>

Great pizza, prices can be a bit on high side unless you keep up with the local daily specials where u can get an above average pizza for an average price. Never a complaint here from me.<//Review>

Here now and its by far the worst deals as far as pizza factories go and skimpy on everything. Salad bar was supplied but ranch must be like gold on this mountain, because they keep that behind the counter. A large salad with a 2oz cup of ranch is ridiculous, not to mention a meal deal with x-large pizza and bread sticks comes with one 2oz ranch and one 2oz pizza sauce. So a family of four were to expected to share??? So I purchased more and still a pain to get it. Overall quality was sad, portions not the full sizes, just everything is sad. We live in the hills 4 hours away and Ione and San Andreas franchise's put this place to shame. I saw this familiar franchise and felt comfortable eating here, boy never do that again! All pizza factory's are not created equal. Never bring our wrestlers here again!</text>

<text>This place is a mess... We called in an order for a large pepperoni and when we arrived, they made a pineapple pizza instead. The cashier said the pineapple and pepperoni pizza buttton are right next to each other. Oh well, things happen and they said they would make us another one. 15 minutes later we ask what's up and they say they don't know what happened to the second pizza. I am sure the labor pool is tough in Prather but C'mon... That's pretty bad (especially after a long day of playing in the snow with worn out children).< /text><name>Robert Delarosa</name>< user>

Not the best experience though.Pizza was good but the employees are pretty rude. Rolling their eyes cause we didn’t call in the order first and making faces, it’s obvious they don’t have Customer service skills. Also the guy that’s making the pizza is also answering the phone and going back to making pizzas not washing his hands or taking off his gloves. I think it could be a lot better but the employees sure need to act like they’re happy people are coming in seems like they’re only nice to people that are regulars that they personally know.  I’m Originally from Fresno and there’s a lot of rude people down here but I didn’t expect this up here in the mountains but apparently because I don’t look like I’m from up there I’m getting an attitude and this Was not the first time.

Went in again different people were working, guy at the counter was way nicer than the other workers. And the pizza was great</Review><GmapID>0x80944988b3f75311:0xe0a7bc5d7f013491</GmapID><username>Serena Ramirez<//username><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

My family and i went on Wednesday after my daughters performance at Foothill Elementary. We order a xl all meat. Med Hawaiian and chicken wings. After we got home my husband and i started with vomiting, diarrhea, chills, and fever. We were sick for three day's!!!!. It was definitely the meat pizza or the chicken wings. NEVER AGAIN!!! We'll be going to this place. HEALTH DEPARTMENT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO COME AND CHECK THIS PLACE!<//Text>

We usually stop here on our way home from camping. It's kind of a tradition now.  Their pizza is great.  The service is great.  The 90's video games are fun too!</Text>

Great sauce and crust -- reheats well too. Lots of options, decent service and a nice lunch buffet. Best restaurant around, actually. An LA 4, a Prather 5.</text>

You should always receive great service from all of our team members, so I'm going to look into this and address it with our staff. As for the food, we're proud of what we have to offer, so I'm sorry if you didn't find it was to your liking. We have a lot of options on our menu, so we'd love to help you find something you'll love should you choose to stop by again. That said, it would be a shame if your impression of our place was ruined by one out-of-the-norm experience, so we hope you'll return so we can show you the level of amazing service we're known for. -Dan Barkume, Owner"}< /Response>

It's an okay place. I saw a show there. It's decent size for the typical small show. It has a nice outdoor area. Parking is not on site, it is at a short distance for a fee. Though I didn't consumed anything I did look at their menu, it's mostly what you'd purchase at a vending machine. Nice little hang out for students though.< /Text>

<text>che cafe is a rad venue, and there are tons of spots to smoke if you are so inclined (despite it being a sober space). the only reason i knocked it down a star is because there is always a serious lack of volunteers working the shows. also you guys could really use a professional to run sound for the bands, i don't think anyone could hear themselves on the monitors.
if you have a chance to go to che though, don't miss it!!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The building goes back to the Camp Matthews days when it was a marine base before UCSD.
It provided me with my first photo exhibit and taught me acceptance of other cultures. I saw the Prince Myshkins perform the Three Penny Opera at the Che Cafe 2006.
Please don't let them take this wonderful establishment away and put up a parking lot.
Thanks and save the Che!</Text>< Pics>

< review>
Bought a $7 pair of sunglasses that didn’t make it to my bag. The cashier asked me if I wanted them in the bag and I said yes. I assumed she put them in my bag but when I got home they were nowhere to be found. I called the store when I realized they weren’t there and told them I’d been there an hour before, what register I was at, the description of the glasses, the price, etc. The guy I spoke with told me “I wasn’t here at that time” and put me on hold for a bit. He later took my number and told me he’d call me right back. I never received a call back and probably never will. I’m not sure if he actually checked to see if they were still there or not. I  don’t want to be a “Karen” and make a huge deal about $7 sunglasses so I’ll just take it as a loss and take this as a lesson to avoid this location. Based on past reviews it has happened before. If you do shop here just make sure you leave with everything you paid for.<//review>

This place is a hot mess so disappointed. Shopping here is like shopping at a goodwill or a thrift store. Every thing is on the floor toys, cloth other items. Dds is there sister store also another hot mess. I rather shop at Macy's there floors are shiny clean everything is well organized.< /Text>

Love me some ross, the deals are great, and so are the employees. Haven't had a bad experience yet just every once in a while they accidentally double scan some things. So just make sure you reread your receipt after a large haul.</Review>

Good place to shop and find hidden gems. The store is big and clean. I can't tell you how many times I've been to a Ross chain and seen it a wreck. This establishment, however, is clean. I loved how everything is organized and label to find what you're looking for or not looking for lol. The prices are good and employees, so far, have been good. Will return!</Text>

Lack of humanity on management! My iphone and wallet was stolen from my car last evening. Good samaritan customers in the store were calling it and my apple watch indicated it was still in the store, and then suddenly my phone was turned off completely. Therefore, the thief was in the store. The security guard told me a man left the store in a hurry, who may or may not have been the thief. I asked management to call over the intercom to announce that if anyone found the phone to please turn it in to the front, still giving the benefit of the doubt to thief and to give an opportunity to return. Management refused and said it was a liability to announce that a phone/wallet was "lost." I think the true liability was that my phone was stolen in the store, with a security guard standing present. They said that if they called for my lost wallet and phone, then they would be doing that all day. It was in these few minutes they could have acted to have potentially made a difference. Now we will never know. Management advised that I call the police. I asked the security guard the description of the man who left the store in a hurry. They wouldn't give me a description. I understand that the man may not have been the thief, but to withhold that information is truly too cautionary. Either way, the thief has no access to my phone since it is attached to my account and I canceled my cards before they had opportunity to use it. However, it's a true disappointment that management did nothing to assist a patron, who was a victim of theft directly in their store, and on the day before Thanksgiving no less. They need to gain some wisdom. Their fear of liability outweighed their humanity. The true liability is that they did nothing to assist in mitigating the opportunity for the thief to leave the store, by acting in good faith and making a simple announcement over the intercom. If a thief knew that the whole store was looking for that phone, that potentially could have made a difference.</Text>

<Review>Every time I come to this store I usually have a hard time finding someone to help me but when I do they usually help. Today was something else. I asked a lady finding help to get a couple of frames of artwork down and she said she was busy and couldn't.  All I said was for her to find someone for me. So then when I repeated to her, she finally called someone for me. Then the other girl came and helped. So when I asked her if they could hold them upfront for me so I could finish shopping she gave me an attitude and said she would help and I would have to take the other. I know it's the holiday season and they are a bit busy but people need to control their attitudes or just find a job where they won't be dealing with clients.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Had no problem talking to three other people who could hear me just fine. Asked for manager and all three times, it was the same first lady. I asked her to stop hanging up on me, but she said she wasn't trying to because she couldn't hear me.  Such bs. Rude and inappropriate. Not how managers should handle phone calls. Not gonna work here, so good luck to anyone who does. Not to mention, the place is always a mess and disorganized every time I walk in.<//Review>< pictures>

Let's respect the hard working people at Ross's Yes they get paid to clean up, but not ridiculous inconsiderate amounts of mess.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c349468fb94eb5:0x5e8f6dc3f1befbe9< /Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>Ross you can always find great deals. Their clothing for kids are a bit pricey considering that you can go to target and get cheaper stuff (why spend a lot of money on clothes that kids grow right out of). I also don't like how ross doesn't allow carts to leave the store. If I buy a lot of stuff while I have my baby; it's a real struggle and inconvenience to carry him and all the stuff I purchased to the car.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

This place is more concerned about patting down clothes before someone tries on an $8.99 shirt that they fail to clean their dirty fitting rooms. The fitting rooms are always nasty. Gum on the walls, dirty sticky and dusty floor and dirty mirrors. Start there Ross staff and corporate.< /Text>

<text>No eye contact, no smile no greetings 😒Cashier busy talking to another employee about their lives. Manager in charge isn't professional, very rude and said she can't give her name because she isn't allowed by the company to give such details when there is a complain. Store is very dirty and disorganized that means employees are lazy. Very racists too.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>
