I wish I could give them more than 5 stars. Excellent taste with fresh ingredients and affordable price (I got my tofu banh mi for $4). Friendly staff and quick serve.<//text>

< Review>
Updated review 5/1/2021.  Today I had their two meat omelette. It contains avocado, bacon, bell peppers, cheese, sausage, onion and spinach. The omelette didn't have much depth and was flat. For $10.50, the omelette comes with a juice or latte. I opted for coffee for $2 extra. Their coffee was decent. It is much better than the Folgers coffee most Chinese restaurants serve. I wasn't quite full after the tasty little thin omelette. A Macau pork chop bun was ordered for takeout in case I get hungry later.

Original review:
Indoor brunch today 3/20/21. The interior of the restaurant felt like a contemporary beer brew house/wine tasting room with brick and wood decor. Jojo's Cafe have three indoor tables and four outdoor tables at their parklet for COVID. They offer American style breakfast specials, Vietnamese entrees such as garlic noodles and pho and Hong Kong style cafe dishes such baked pork chops spaghetti and instant noodles (they call it "ramen" on their menu.) I had the corned beef hash, eggs over easy, hash browns, sausage breakfast plate $9 and pork chops instant noodles $6. In tradition with Hong Kong style cafes, the food came out within five minutes. The waitress was really busy with to-go overs and other customers with all seven tables full at 11am. The golden crispy hash browns and over easy style eggs were acceptable. The corned beef hash and sausage were salty and missed their mark on texture. The broth on my pork chops instant noodles was  overpowered with a vegetable soup taste. The chef put too much broccoli and lettuce in there. I would have preferred the seasoning pack that came with Top Ramen. A traditional tomato based Hong Kong style cafe broth would have worked too. The egg and pork chop were good though. My bill was $20 with tax and tip.<//Review>

<text>Newly remodeled looks completely different than it did before and the ordering process is also different. You now order like a fast food restaurant where you order at the counter and take a number. They have two menus one is your traditional Chinese rice plates and the other American style breakfast. The rice plates are $9 and you get a ton of rice, I happen to see someone else eating pan fried noodles which weren't on the menu. The house special noodles was a little too salty for my taste but still good. Currently offering 15% off promo not sure if it was applied since I didn't get an itemized receipt.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlM8GM3FE_x8JcKMCA2oOC0waGD2O1w4OLatnG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMmbO6kagFufAKX0hNL0Bz5c73fgUy4XSQ5y4Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

Cute, cozy, modern cafe serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. A good portion of the food is build your own entree: rice bowl, soup bowl, or noodle plate. The rest of the food is brunch or the usual Cantonese cafe food. The food is clean, not too salty, and portions are not oversized. They accept credit card with no minimum and deliver. This cafe serves traditional Cantonese cafe food without the usual cash only payment option.<//Review>

The combination sandwich I had was lacking  flavor.  Service was kind of slow. My sandwich came pretty quickly but my husband's noodle took a long time.  By the time my husband's noodle bowl came, I was almost done with my sandwich.  I took my time as is. My husband was disappointed with his noodle bowl also.</Review>

< Review>
This new and improved JoJo's is now very obviously geared towards a younger generation with the cute decor and "pay before you eat" system. They also serve a lot of Vietnamese food now which is kinda strange because I always thought of this place as Hong Kong-ese. In any case, I feel like the crowd here is the same: older folks and persons who want a quick meal alone.

I come here quite often actually and it's mainly because of their 3.99 BREAKFAST! No where else can you get an egg, bacon/sausage, slice of toast, and hash browns/french toast/pancake for 3.99.

Another plus, the Hong Kong milk tea is as close as you can get to an actual authentic milk tea in America (according to my parents who are from Hong Kong).</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Jo Jo's is one of my go-to places for clean Chinese food. It turns out they recently switched to serving Vietnamese food but kept a few of their previous items. I was a little skeptical but decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did! I was torn between their Beef Noodle Soup and the Laksa. I'm a huge fan of Laksa and opted for the Vietnamese noodles instead. Also ordered a Macaroni Soup with sausages and an egg for the kids which they inhaled. The Laksa is one of the better ones I've had. Broth was well balanced in taste and texture. It was not too thick and not too light, just right. It wasn't over powered with the coconut flavor so you can taste the subtle hint of shrimp paste. I believe it's usually served with the vermicelli but I went with the Vietnamese noodles instead since it can carry more of the flavor of the soup. Customer service was impeccable. I'm one of those customers that need to customize everything and have to have it just the way I want and they gave me just that. Suggestions were taken and requests were fulfilled. Full and satisfied belly at the end of the night. I really couldn't have asked for more. I"ll definitely be back for the Beef Noodle Soup!< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
Sadly JoJo's Chinese menu is gone. Those fantastic salt and pepper chicken wings are no more. Its the same owners but they've changed the restaurant to a Vietnamese restaurant. They also rearranged some of the furniture. Decided to give them a try and I just found it to be bland Vietnamese food. Nothing really special about it. They still have chicken wings on the menu but now it's 4 pieces for $6. I asked if they were under new management but all they said is that the cook had changed. I hope they do well and stay in business but without their old menu and Pho Ha Tien being right down the block doesn't leave me much reason to go back.< /Review>

The food is excellent, and in good portions !! The staff is very nice and very pleasant and attentive to explain the dishes, tastes, side dishes, ...
Also, the prices are not high compared to other restaurants!
The manager is also very nice and come and see us to chat with us, exchange ideas and I find that this brings a plus to the restaurant, we are not just wallets, we are customers !!
In 5 days, I went there twice, too bad I didn't notice it from the start !!
Next time I come back to San Francisco, sure to come back !!
Thank you very much 🤗

Pour ma première fois à San Francisco, j'ai voulu manger dans un petit restaurant chinois et j'avoue ne pas être déçu savoir choisi celui-ci !!
La nourriture est excellente, et en bonne portion !! Le personnel est très gentil et très agréable et à l'écoute pour vous expliquer les plats, les goûts, les accompagnements, ...
De plus, les prix ne sont pas élevés par rapport à d'autres restaurants !
La responsable est également très sympas et viens nous voir pour discuter avec nous, échanger et je trouve que cela apporte un plus au restaurant, on est pas juste des porte feuilles, nous sommes des clients !!
En 5 jours, j'y suis allé 2 fois, dommage que je ne l'ai pas remarqué des le début !!
La prochaine fois que je reviens à San Francisco, sûr et certain que j'y reviens !!
Merci beaucoup 🤗</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This is a more unusual location, though - on one visit their credit card machine was down completely, and on another they stopped accepting Discover and Amex. Their women's room was closed, and they were handwriting orders on a pad instead of using the printer. I...don't know if I am comfortable eating here.</Review>< pics>

<Review>This is definitely one of the sadder BK's I've been to. I recommend driving 5 minutes in literally any direction to get to a variety of much much better burger joints. 2 minutes away north on Race St is Five Guys. Do yourself a favor and 'Have it Your Way' by going somewhere else.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>They suck so bad. They get my order wrong each time and make me pay for something more expensive. I hate all Burger Kings each one does this to me. Today I had to go in and demand for my drive thru order. I never have a problem at McDonald's or any other fast food place like I do at Burger King.</review>< Gmap_id>

<username>Mike Reynolds<//username><Review>At the risk of sounding non-PC, if you don't speak Spanish, your order will not be correct.  I've tried to order a spicy chicken sandwich, and failed, and ordered a Whopper with no onions, which had onions.  Otherwise, a perfectly satisfactory BK, aside from the fact that the lettuce is guaranteed to be brown.<//Review>< Resp>

Dirty. Grease-ridden boxes on the countertops. Nasty bathrooms. The Whopper and fries didn't taste as good as other Burger Kings either. 2 stars because the food didn't make me throw up.<//Review>

Couple of pet peeves of mine: when I ask for extra pickles, I expect the cook to know NOT to just put them all in a single clump, and, when I go to a restaurant like BK in the U.S. I expect to be able to order in english. The food itself was good, hot and as expected  (other than the clump of pickles). I thought it odd that at 12noon there was literally 1 other customer inside and 1 in drive thru -- odd until I tried to order, when I realized no one in the place appeared to speak english. Lucky for me, and surprisingly to the cashier, I am fluent in spanish. The restaurant was clean and well maintained inside, but there were a number of transients sleeping, looking in trash bins, etc all around the property -- not a location I'd visit after dusk.</text>

My husband cut down a huge tree at our front side yard that’s leaning towards the side of our house. He finally got rid of the tree and called Got That Junk to remove those branches that’s been sitting in our front lawn. The guys came and got rid of every single branch within an hour. Good service, very affordable and good communication. Thumbs up.</Text>

<review>They have themselves another satisfied customer! I put a quote out on Yelp for assistance hauling junk. Erica responded so quickly it was amazing! Even more amazing was their ability to pencil me in the very next day! I wish I would have taken photos but, let me tell you, I went from having a driveway full of junk to not even a sliver of wood on the ground. I definitely had junk for Got That Junkk. Shame on me for not remembering the name of the gentlemen that were here but, for a customer-facing company, they were completely professional, kind, and considerate. They ensured all needs were met. As if that wasn’t enough, they were by far the best priced. One company, once I told them what Erica quoted me, didn’t even bother answering my subsequent texts! I will be contacting them again in the future for sure!

Thank you, Got That Junkk!!</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1617265539460, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your business and time.'}</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>This was our first time using a Junk removal company. Got That Junkk is a small family business. Erica gave me an estimate about an hour after I sent her  a video of “our junk” and she was able to schedule a pickup for the next day. We had a lot of junk and it took two trips and almost 2 full truck loads! DJ and his partner were very polite, friendly and professional. They worked quickly and neatly and were able to maximize the load by breaking down whatever they could before putting it on the truck. We were cleaning out our garage and we had an assortment of old furniture and just about everything else imaginable including lots of trash! The price we paid was fair and reasonable and far less than we would have paid to the bigger Junk removal companies. We were highly satisfied with “Got That Junkk” and their team! We would gladly hire them again!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

D.J. and Lavelle were clearly experienced, showed up on time, very efficient and throughout the entire job, friendly and courteous, and cleaned up when the job was done.  I got a great price too. Thank you for a top notch job!</Review>< user_name>

<text>I needed a tv hauled away cause I'm too lazy to do it myself 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, so I contacted Got That Junkk, received a great quote, scheduled a pickup time, and on the day of I received a notification they'd be arriving in 20 minutes and were right on time. No issues, no hassle, exactly what you'd want from any service. I'd highly recommend them to anyone that needs hauling or clean up assistance....<//text><user_name>Mack Myles< /user_name>< date>

DJ and his Got That Junkk was the best decision I made to have the job done and completed just right. Getting rid of stuff and junk just makes things much better and lots more room. I can't say enough of how much I appreciate this company and the service I experienced. Great job, indeed.

If you need someone to come haul it away, DJ is your man and Got That Junkk is the company to use. Thank you.<//Review>

They went above and beyond what they were here to do, moving other boxes around that were out of place that I was not able to move myself. A Christian based business. God did promised in His Word that whatever I need I should call unto Him and He would deliver, therefore He allowed our path to cross. Thank you, Got That Junkk.< /Text>

<review>Solid place, sometimes things don't work... change machine, the control panel, and the actual water nozzle but you can always find one station that works properly. Shaded area to dry your car. Sinks n faucets to rinse things out. Overall pretty good place.</review><name>William Garcia< /name>< gmapID>

The people that work here are always parked in handicap!
Ive asked owner of this vechile to please move, since they do not have a handicap, they say they r working. So they can't move.
Love coming here to wash van once a week. Hate to have to look for another place!</text>

<text>Love this car wash. Plenty of bayes for washing and drying. The only downsize is that when it's full the water pressure drops.</text></record></dataset><record>

Washed my ride and vacuumed with $5 usually I go pay someone at a hand car wash to wash it but this time I didn’t want to sit and wait so I decided to come here... I have two closer to my house but I was in the commerce area and googled a place near me and gave me this one that seemed far better than others in the area.. will come back.< /review>

Pretty good car wash place. Reccomend bringing your own towels to dry the car but other then that pretty good.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The machine that dispatches the rags to dry the car was not serving and just grabbed my money without giving me anything. I think you should pay attention to that. It is a dollar that from client to client already makes a lot of money.

La maquina que despacha los trapos para secar el carro no estaba sirviendo y solo agarro mi dinero sin darme nada. Creo que deberían poner atención en eso.

Went for quick car cleaning. Car wash is ancient, 7$ for basic wash, car not really clean. Vacuum ate 1.50$ and didn’t start. Clerk claimed that he can neither manually start the vacuum nor reimburse my 6 quarters, I have to wait for the manager who’ll be in the next day. Please take your business elsewhere.<//Text>

Whoever was working September 12th at 2:28 a.m. deserves to be fired sees me knocking and still doesn't come to the window and I saw him/her grabbing beers out of the refrigerator. Very rude and unprofessional I mean if you can't be a good gas station attendant I don't have much hope for your future.<//text>

I would give this place a negative if it were possible. My wife and I have been regular patrons since we live in the area......we let some things slide with the very rude staff since they are clearly uneducated. However lately, their car wash has been either broken and acting up and every time the rude staff would advice us to come the next day or something....this has happened several times, subsequently we neither get reimbursed or have our car washed. The final straw was tonight when after several attempts of putting in a valid code, the car wash machine kept saying it was an invalid code so I went to as expected rude night shift attendant, who checked the code and said it was valid and for me to try again....so I did and to no surprise it did not accept the code. I took a photo that I punched in the code as instructed and the message remained invalid code. Went back to the rude attendant, who insisted that an invalid code was valid????showed him the photo and yet he insisted it works.....I asked if he understood what ‘invalid” means, I emphasized it means that it will not work....he then shooed me off acting like a tough guy hiding behind the glass window and locked doors. I will be reporting this to the BBB and file a formal complaint to the city. I can only imagine how many residents they have victimized with this modus operandi of theirs. And for the tough guy attendant hiding behind the glass window, I’m sure we’ll meet outside at some point.....<//Text>

Car wash was broken and they would not refund the cost. Guy who was working there said there was nothing he could do about it including refunding my money. Very rude and unprofessional and told me to come back in the morning to deal with it but I don't live in the area so not even an option.  Would not recommend unless you are fine with them stealing your money!<//Review>

<Text>Car wash had low water pressure and/or nozzles were clogged. My car was still soapy when the wash "finished" and dryers kicked on.

Management, please comment when this issue has been resolved and the car wash has been repaired.<//Text>< user_id>

<review>It's always crowded because it's so close to the freeway on and off ramps. But the worst thing is the motorcycle groups that are allowed to gather there in Sunday mornings before they head out.  They overtake the gas station, leave no room to drive through and it's discouraging to regular drivers.
The drive through far wash dies a mediocre job, it doesn't dry well, and the hand vacuum usually doesn't work.</review>< pictures>

<review>Just a side note I've come here in the past for rapid COVID test and both visits went fine. I was charged my copay both times before I was tested. Today, I wait patiently for 2.5 hours, get called to the back.  I'm following the normal process and I'm told they will be performing the send out test NOT the rapid. I ask why the previous times they were rapid and was told my insurance didn't cover.  I then questioned why the last 2 times I was never told this and both previous times I was just charged a copay.  While I don't care about paying for the test I do care about time wasted. I asked why I was never told this while I was waiting!  I sat for 2 and a half hours and could have went somewhere else.  The person assisting me in the back tried reasoning with me and ended up giving me the rapid test after signing a waiver saying I'm responsible for paying if my insurance rejected it.  Like I said, I don't care if I have to pay for the test but you can't give me my time back.  The other times I've been here I was under the impression that my insurance covered it since I paid the copay. The assistant in the back told me the front desk doesn't look at past visits and wouldn't be able to determine if my insurance covered.  ?!?! Huh I'm confused why did they charge me a copay in the past and never told me it wasn't covered. So what is it?!   Then the person helping me kept telling me I can talk to billing.  Again, I'll pay but you could've told me in the beginning that my insurance didn't cover so I could seek a place that did.   I sat for over an hour waiting for my results.  I actually had to get up and ask the receptionist if they forgot.  I waited another 10 min, 7:10PM now and they handed me my results which was time stamped 5:57PM.  So I waited even longer.  All in all i spent about 4hrs for a not so Rapid test.  results were fast, staff not really.  Oh and the assistant in the back that I mentioned earlier decided it was OK to butt into the conversation I was having with the receptionist about insurance and not letting me know ahead of time.  AGAIN she asked me to talk to billing!!!!  Like I said again and again to her, I don't care if I had to pay out of pocket.  She didn't get that I'm upset about the time I've wasted sitting here when I could've gone somewhere else!!!!!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>This place is not good urgent care to go to especially on a weekend. My experience today was really bad. They only have a Physician Assistant (no ID badge, no white coat)  who attended to me, seems like he does not know what he’s doing (looking confused). I asked him questions but he only returns my questions back to me (he even scratched his head in front of me). I have not gotten any good answers or any diagnosis from him. By the way, I went to this urgent care because I am having low blood pressure reading and symptomatic and also it’s after clinic hours. Then he requested for blood works, nurse came in, the usual looked for my vein,  start poking me and never got any blood. Tried to look at the same spot, maybe to poke me again. The nurse excuse herself to get something, then I was thinking that I should just leave this place because seems like no one knows or not sure what they’re doing. I left the room feeling so upset, saw patients waiting in the lobby. I yelled out at the lobby that that place is not a good place to go to and that NO doctors available in that clinic on a weekend. What a day, I will never go back to AFC Urgent Care in Chula Vista. I ended up going to the Emergency Room.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1621881033511, 'text': 'Hi Marie, we regret not meeting your expectations during your recent visit.

I arrived before 5am to secure the second spot in line.  I checked in at 8, then got seen <2hrs later.  I recommend waiting in the car after you check in.  Even the first group in line waited for an hour and a half after checking in.  They give you a call when it's your turn.  They only offer rapid testing for the first 25 customers (results in ~10mins for $249).  No appointments, only walk-ins.  Results for the non-rapid test take 3+ days.   Bathroom can be better maintained.  Everyone at the front desk was cheerful.  Hope this review helps.<//review>

I visited AFC Urgent Care Bonita because I was experiencing mild-moderate chest pain and breathing discomfort. The check-in process was very easy. The waiting area was set up following COVID-19 safety guidelines so a few patients opted to wait outside or in their cars since the seats were limited. There were probably five patients ahead of me so my total wait time after checking in was a little less than a hour, which I find reasonable for a walk-in facility. The staff are all very professional and friendly. The FNP (S******n) who examined me was extremely empathetic and showed genuine concern in my symptoms while maintaining a positive mindset which instantly gave me peace of mind. I was prescribed a new inhaler and picked it up at the Ride-Aid across the parking lot right after my appointment. Overall a great experience if you are willing to be patient before you are seen. I can tell the team work as efficiently as they can to see as many patients as possible.< /Text>

The AFC team did a great job overall. The young lady who was answering the phones on the morning of 9/12 was very pleasant and expressed concern for my issue.  I went that Saturday afternoon and there appeared to be plenty of staff handling the clients. I waited maybe 20 minutes and was taken in for vitals. The nurse practitioner came in after about 5 min and got right to the problem. I was in serious pain due to a workout injury and his course of treatment was exactly what I needed. The check out process was just as quick regardless of the afternoon receptionist who seemed not as patient as the morning intake rep. But not enough for me to drop the 5 stars.< /review>

<Text>I was referred here by the VA Healthcare.. Waited 2 hours + Overall it felt very Rushed once I was seen, No personal touch, visit was less than 1 minute with the Doctor if he was a Doctor I'm not sure he did not have an ID Badge or Name Tag with a title. He might have been a Physicians Assistant. Again I wouldn't know because he did not introduce himself. He walked in the room rushed and said "what's up, what's the issue" Got  what I needed for my issue I think? If you can make the extra mile to go to the VA it might be worth your time. if you need something local, just be mindful that time will me a lot less that what you are use to at the VA healthcare system.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

<text>This facility was expeditious, polite, and professional.  It was the cleanest hospital I've seen since leaving Orange Hills an relocating to Chula Vista. The wait time was nothing compared to other hospitals in the county.  I was very impressed with the smooth way staff handeled my situation as I had to have multiple tests in various sections of the facility. Overall I would give a battery of ten stars yet they only go to five. Nurse Brennan and Nurse Julia were spectacular as were all the Doctors and xray technicians. Kudos to San Yisidro Health Center located on Third Avenue in Chula Vista. (Not to be confused with the Otay Lakes facility.) Sincerely,

Great staff from the front desk to the doctor.

Very friendly staff; after my consultation I picked up my medicine at the wrong location so I called in the AFC front desk and she forwarded my prescription to an approved location right away. Great attitude and willingness to help.
The doctor is very knowledgeable about my gout problem. She is the right person for the job.

Highly recommended. Good place for a veteran like myself.

Keep up the great work.<//review>

< review>
I was very ill with fever and other concerning symptoms, I was referred here by the VA Healthcare and they took care of me right away.  I had to wait for a few hours but overall the service was excellent. I was tested for COVID 19 as part of the routine check up and it was negative.  Received the results via email.  This location is perfect for me so I didn't have to drive to the VA ER at La Jolla that day, I couldn't drive a  long distance with a high fever and body aches. I felt better the next few days following the recommended treatment.

However, today on 10.8.20 I went back because I was sick again and the doctor who saw me said they couldn't help me and that I had to go to the ER.  I basically got kicked out by the doctor without any further explanation and had to call the VA for assistance.  The way this happened was unreasonable, for this reasons I changed my review and I don't recommend this place for Veterans.< /review>

I HAVE TAKEN BOTH MY WIFE AND MY MOTHER IN LAW HERE BEFORE, TWO DIFFERENT TIMES AND NONE OF THOSE TIMES WERE THE PHYSICIANS ANY HELP. THE WAIT WAS ABOUT THE SAME FOR BOTH TMES, ABOUT 2HRS EACH TIME ONLY TO WASTE OUR TIME AND NOT HELP.  RECEPTIONIST ARE POLITE BUT THE PHYSICIANS ARE A JOKE!< /text>

I'm sad because my husband takes my step son here and usually has a good experience.  I take my boys there too and on our last visit 2/23/20, the doctor was absolutely terrible.  She barely came into the room.  The office tech seems more compassionate and knowledgeable than the doctor, Jennifer Doumas, DO.  My son had had a fever for 10 days in a row.  She said he just needed to wait it out.  She hadn't even examined him!  She had no clue the tech gave my son a flu test!  I had to tell her.  She left the room and after a few minutes I went into doorway of the doctors office and the doctor was mapping a place online!  So I asked her if she could tell me the results of the flu test.  She then said she would be right in.  When she came back into our room, I asked her to examine my son.  Then she said he had some fluid in his ear but it was not severe.  Needless to say I took my son to his practitioner the next day and he has a sever ear infection and he needed antibiotics!  Anyhow, the AFC bill came in and it was $280!  I hope the money goes to the tech and not the poor doctor.  If we need to go back to urgent care, I will certainly be calling in next time to make sure Jennifer Doumas, DO, is not working that day!< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I had a LHI appointment on 09/23/2020 at 08:00 A.M. I check in with AFC Urgent care in OTAY Lake RD @0800. I waited 50 minutes and I went to the fornt desk representative Darlene Garcia told her, I have been waiting for 50 minutes and you have not check my vitals or nothing. She said I am next line or I can reschedule through LHI. I told her that I have already did the reschedule. I told her that I wanted to file a complaint for unethical business practices and discrimination base on my skin color and race. I was only Asian in the room and they were taking care of white and Hispanic people before me. I told her that I want to talk to the management and Practice Manager Elizabeth Justich came to the front desk. She told there is complaint form here and gave me blank paper of printer. she told me write my complaints. I told her I am service member and I had appointment at 0800 and now it is 0850. I told her that I m being treated like walk-in. I had to experience discrimination and it ruin my day.< /review>< date>

<text>I came in and really should have taken my son to the hospital for asthma. The doctor was wonderful in stabilizing my son enough to get us to ER.  She educated me on the lungs, and when I should go to ER as apposed to an urgent care. The staff was very nice and handle the urgency of my situation very smoothly and patiently.  The environment was clean, and nice for patients and their families. The staff made sure to give patients good information on care and on billing.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>I had an emergency, I stepped on a metal wire that went through my shoe into my foot. The receptionist (best lady EVER!) came out and brought me a wheelchair and explained the prices thoroughly. I needed to make sure I was able to afford it. Watched some Guardians of the Galaxy while I waited, maybe 10min if that. Got a tetanus shot (I have a needle phobia) the nurse was nice and gentle, it was so fast I barely felt it. I totally recommend this urgent care, I went in dreading and in pain and I left smiling and feeling at ease!<//Text><rating>5< /rating>< userid>

Yes, go! If only I could give more than 5 stars...
I was seen within 10 minutes of arrival. The doc, who simply introduced himself as Austin, listened to my concerns + he was very understanding. The staff was kind & friendly.  The modest waiting & exam rooms were very clean & new. I appreciated the after visit summary that included vitals, diagnosis + copy of rx's.</Review>

I have gone to this facility in the past & have had the same insurance for 27 years, so I was confused. I called my insurance first thing Monday and was told there was no issue, I was covered and should have been seen. The woman at the front desk that day made no move to look deeper, I was told they could have easily checked the website and gotten clarification. In the past, while the wait was long, all staff was kind & the doctors were on point. I have mixed feelings now after my last visit there, so I give 3 stars.< /Text>< pics>

The nurse on duty coupled with the front desk / customers service personal attended to me immediately . l was extremely impressed with service rendered. I would gladly recommend this place  to my friends in case of any unforeseen  minor and non life threatening emergencies.</Review>< pictures>

I waited from 750-830 to be seen and I was the first patient of the day. And I was seen for all of 10 min to take weight and blood pressure asked a few questions then on to the exam room for another 5 min to be told you have the common cold. $129 for 15 min. Absolutely ridiculous. I can’t get health insure thru work because it’s not offered. And work needed a doctor note, mexico on a Saturday would have been horrible when your sick.

Very nice visit. Arrived to have a persistent cough looked at. Front desk staff were courteous and professional. Paperwork was handled expeditiously. Wait time was reasonable: not rushed but not too long either. Doctor was attentive, asked all the right questions and offered a diagnosis/treatment that made sense; e.g. - no knee jerk defaults to antibiotics or 'something to take' just for the sake of taking something. A nice experience. Would recommend AFC Urgent Care.< /text>

<Review>I was so happy that your clinic take my health insurance. But I can’t believe it that the doctor would not give me steroid medication for my health issue. The doctor gave me an ointment prescription for me to pick up at the pharmacy but non of the pharmacy has it. I know for fact that if the doctor gave me a steroid medication, the pharmacy has it. Seeing the doctor did not do me any good. I was told that I have to see my family doctor and the dermatologist when I get back to my home state. Thank you for accepting my health insurance but I wish you had a better doctor.</Review><Rating>2< /Rating><user_name>Marie Jane Lacson Camet Ladd</user_name><resp>{'time': 1539960541394, 'text': 'Hi Marie Jane Lacson Camet Ladd, we are sorry to hear that you were unhappy during your visit.

<review>I went in to see someone regarding my neck pain and I saw Nurse Practitioner Charles and he was great. My neck pain came from sleeping wrong, improper ergonomics and basically not taking care of my body as an athlete and it was nice to have someone who is also an athlete and understands my drive to get back to being an athlete. He suggested a lot of things that I can do for treatment instead of pain killers as I am pregnant. The staff from the front desk, to the nurse were great. Facility is clean and there was no wait at all. I went in at 5:30pm on a Saturday and I was expecting it was going to be so busy but it was not.<//review>< response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>The urgent care center is located in a nice shopping center and was easy to find. The office and patient rooms were well organized and clean. The wait time was extremely short and the staff were friendly. The doctor I saw was extremely caring and helpful. I'm currently without insurance coverage so I paid cash but the rate was extremely affordable and it was my first visit so it should be even cheaper next time. Not one bad thing to say about this place in my experience.< /Review>< Pictures>

I was impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of the staff. The facility was very clean. The wait was relatively short. The doctor had a "good bedside manner". She was very knowledgeable, professional, yet down to earth. It was definitely a Five Star experience for me.</review>

I was there for two hours with breathing problems and one woman came in with makeup, earrings, perfume on, and nicely dressed no signs of distress.  Sat down for about five minutes and asked to pay for co-payment then said I am having breathing problems.  I was using my ProAir the whole time ; then when I heard she was next I told the girl at the front counter that I put down I have asthma and bronchitis and could not breath and was not feeling good.  She said was next and that's when I said did you read my sheet and see what it said.  After two terrible hours with no services I left.  I would not go there ever again.  I will go to the hospital next time and save on a co-pay from now on.  The most screwed up services I have ever seen at that was my first time ever going there.<//text>< pics>

<review>The only 2 things i liked about this urgent care is that it is open during the weekends and it wasn't busy at all. I gave it a 1 start because my husband came in for stitches on his finger. In our opinion the doctor didn't do a good job. I think it could have used a few more stitches. There are large gaps in between stitches leaving tissue exposed. There is chucks of tissue sticking out and a small portion was not stitch. They were going to begin to stitch with out numbing it first. The doctor seemed very nervous and seems to have a hard time performing. They didn't know where the supplies were located. This experience made us feel uncomfortable and uneasy. It seemed the doctor hadn't done many stitches before or any at all. We are concerned about how it will heal and its been 3 days now.

Update: it's been a week now and i just received a bill in the mail for $400 for what i think is a botched stitch job. Not only did they not do a good job, they also wrote an incorrect prescription. They prescribed antibiotics for 10 days, 2xs a day but only wrote down a quantity of 10 pills. It should have been written as a quantity of 20 pills. Now i have this large bill that doesn't add up to the quality of work. How do you pay someone full price when the wasn't done correctly.</review>< pictures>

MISJUDGMENT: I went in and explained all my symptoms and was seen fairly quickly (it wasn't busy). So I was crying in pain, waiting for the doctor and she came in and didnt even assess me she just asked me to explain my symptoms once again and concluded that I was only "having an anxiety attack" and they cant treat me there. I left and took myself to the ER where I was admitted to the hospital and  spent 5 days there. 2 surgeries later I learned I have something scary going on 😑 Despite the nice service and friendly dimeaners they were to quick to judge a book by its cover, they should have done more. I realize now I was shaking my legs and crying in the room so it probably looked like I was on drugs because they all gave me that look and looked at each other like "oh shes on one" but you shouldn't look at someone and say "this is wrong with you I cant help" without even checking properly.< /Text>

I came here with my son about a month ago and had a wonderful experience. The doctor was genuinely concerned and avoided the ER that day. I would give it 5 except that my husband got there 5 minutes before closing today and was not received. So if it's truly an urgency, go with that in mind.</text>

The doc came in looked at it and said it was Hands, foot and mouth disease, proscribed an ointment to put on it. Today i took him to his primary doctor and he said NO they misdiagnosed him and it was no where near being Hands foot and mouth, that it was impetigo and put him on antibiotics.  His primary couldn't understand why the urgent care doctor would diagnose him with that when he had no fever, or any of the other signs of hand foot and mouth and no other sores anywhere else.

I google searched urgent care center around the town and this place had the most scores on reviews, so we chose this place.  My wife had urinary traction infection and we made a visit together at 8:06 a.m. Sunday because she needed English translation.  It was our first time visit, so we didn't know what to expect.   The front desk receptionist (black lady) was very polite and handled professionally.  Our Doctor was a woman and she explained well about women's issue and friendly, too.   Our arrival time was 8:06 a.m, one patient ahead of us, took us 20 min waiting at the lobby, total arrival to departure time was less than an hour.  This may vary depending on how many patients are ahead of you.
Overall, this is a good place to go without an appointment.< /review><response>{'time': 1501696822200, 'text': 'Thank you for taking your wife in to see us and sharing such a great review so others can see the level of care we provide.

This was by far the best urgent care I've ever been to.  All the staff was friendly and professional, and they saw me quickly.  The clinic is clean and new, and they even do a follow up call to make sure you are well and have no further questions.  I highly recommend this for your choice of an urgent care,</review>

If it had been treated right starting this past Saturday it would be clearing already, but there are now new lesions in your mouth that were need to address.". So she prescribed two steroids (oral paste and ointment) and my new "scabies" cream went straight in the trash.  What a waste of my time and money.

Waited 2 hours, paid way too much money, and didn't even see a doctor, only saw a physician's assistant, who doesn't know what they are talking about.  An X-ray tech is doing the nurses job.  You have to wait a long time at every step.  Wait to register, wait to see an x-ray tech doing a nurses job, wait to see physician's assistant, wait for lab, wait again for PA, wait even more for the privilege of paying them lots of money.</Text>

<Name>Becca Nelson<//Name><Text>Actually 0 stars if that's possible. I'll start my mentioning I have worked in the medical field as a CNA. And this has been my worst experience with the field. After over 2 hours (which with urgent care I expect the wait, no big deal, I'm patient) but after this wait I was "seen" by the rudest, most inattentive, snarky, useless dr I've ever dealt with (and I've dealt with a lot of doctors). She might as well of walked in handed me a antibiotic px and left. She told me to go to a family dr and have them deal with it. When I explained I live in Iowa and am only here for a month, I have insurance and can pay the copay, urgent care is a lot simpler than trying to find another provider, she kinda just hmphed. She wasn't even going to really look at my wound until I put it up to about chest level pointed and told her to. She was in the room for less than 5 mins, basically told me it isn't her job or her problem and then gave me an antibiotic. She also mentioned that if it gets worse I should look into going to the ER.  Looks like I may try to be seen by a "real" dr cus she couldn't be bothered to earn her medical license.< /Text>< user>

Terrible!!!!!!! Was only patient in building. After waiting over an hour with 103 fever, coughing , couldn't barely breathe, I left and got treatment in Mexico.  Never saw anyone come out of back. Receptionist kept saying someone would see me shortly...they never did. Found out I had pneumonia from doctor in Mexico.<//Text>

<Text>Long wait with only 1 other family in the waiting room, turns out, the receptionist "couldn't find" my insurance info. I finally had to go ask her about the long wait...AS the other family was going to the doc before me, and she said, "oh yeah, I couldn't find your information, can I see your I.D. again?"
Once finally inside, the nurse (not an R.N.) took vitals, no smile, no "Hi, I'm nurse so and so, how are you today?" Felt like MEPS for those of you who know what that is. Was taken to the exam room and waited another half hour, literally, for the doctor, who was only a P.A. Looked disheveled like he just woke up. Again, no introduction, just asked what was wrong, took my temp, listen to lungs, looked in throat etc., and said they would take a throat culture and abruptly left. Another 10 minutes later that first "nurse" took the culture, laughed, as did I, at my gag reflex. Never had such a painful throat culture taken. I think that should have been a clue something was wrong with me that they didn't catch. About 15 minutes later, Dr. Disheveled came back and said, "well its not strep. So just keep taking the Advil, anything else?" I replied no, thanked him and left. Its been 5 days and I've gotten worse, cant talk, cant swallow, painful throat. I'll see a real doctor this time.<//Text>< Pictures>

Would give zero stars if that was an option.  I and my husband are from out of town!  My husband had an infected eye and thought it was pink eye.  We went to this facility for some medical care!  The wait was long!  After finally getting in they attempted to take my husband bp and after 3 times well let's say have not seen anyone take it that way!!  We saw the doctor who was very nice and checked out my husbands eye and concluded conjunctivitis and prescribed drops!  At this time he also had leasons on half his face as same as affected eye!  Nothing was said I was not sure what caused it after all im not the doctor!

Well needless to say after going home and putting these drops in my husband's eye we saw no change in 2.days amd getting worse.

We were in the ER yesterday and the doctor took one look and said classic shingles!  She asked me where he was diagnosised and I told her!  She couldn't believe the missed diagnosis! She said the drops they gave him were useless!

Now he is on proper medication and has to see an opthomogist today hoping there will.be no permanent damage to his eye!

I would caution anyone  going here for a proper diagnosis!</text>

Worst experience I've ever encountered. They forgot that was even in the room and made everything worse instead of treating me.  The nurse didn't even administer a shot right and now I'm having to visit another doctor to correct it.  Worst treatment ever.<//Review>

You can hear the staff talking about patient cases in the hallway as you are waiting in the room to be seen (HIPPA violations galore) and I had to practically make the NP who saw me actually look at everything that I came in for instead of writing it off and sending me me home. I would be afraid to go here if I didn't already know what needed to happen diagnostically, because both times I have been here the care has been sub-par. I am a healthcare provider and do not endorse this practice.< /text>

< review>
This has got to be the worst urgent care on earth.  Doctors are worthless and the staff especially the girl at the desk Veronica is extremely careless and lied to me telling me she was the manager. She isn't the maanger she's a scum bag and doesn't know her head from her butt. I know for sure I will never use this place as long as I live. I hope they close down.<//review>

<review>This section of sand dunes is always great. I haven’t had any complaints/tickets with parking and the dunes are simply surreal. I usually just stop by here when I’m driving by, but I came out once to shoot a bit for short film. There’s something beautiful about the size of the dunes and patterns found there. I highly recommend seeing them.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN-y9hHghz6zAZKy_4mCG9ZUn54e3iQm0W9DoJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4VSyblalxKLTo3duOzVQNUym7qFubhX0uxrwP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

If you've never experienced sand dunes and you're not going to hoping buggy, put on closed toed shoes, get past some of the human littering and hike up. It's not easy.  If you have kids,  let them climb up and slide or roll down.  The ranger station has pamphlets.  Enjoy!</text>< pictures>

<Rate>3</Rate><resp>None< /resp><review>This coffee shop has taken over the space formerly occupied by Refill. It is a big step down compared to Refill, which was one of the more stylish coffeeshops in the 'hood. The new owner inexplicably got rid of the blue chairs which matched the decor (what you'll see on the photos posted here) and replaced them with less attractive metal chairs. For some reason they allow the place to always look trashy. An equipment cart that should be stored in the back is instead out front, apparently to block access behind the counter (why?). The former condiment shelf is now covered with buckets and trash. Amazon boxes are piled under the seats. The previous tasteful artworks have been replaced with garish posters and big screen TVs showing lousy TV shows - today "Judge Judy" with the sound off. On the plus side, they have terrific beer specials for happy hour.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Time>

This toast! Stacked so high, every other bite I was wiping Sriracha and avocado off my nose 😄 Thick slice (yes), slather of cream cheese (yessss), avocado+bacon+Sriracha (yes x3!). Super tasty and definitely a full meal (*paired with a hazelnut cold brew of course!)< /Text>

Wow so we ordered the chagaccino with oat milk and oh my goodness. 1. I have never seen anyone foam oat milk so well. It looked like a real cappuccino. 2. The flavors blended so perfectly together. I loved the idea but was really nervous about the cinnamon. I usually find it to be a little too intense in a coffee drink. Nope, this was seriously magical. It’s a little pricey, and we did have to ask to have a new one made because it wasn’t very hot at first but they were super sweet and understanding and didn’t make me feel like the Karen I thought I was being 😅 I usually avoid modern style coffee shops because I think (like with a bar) the older and sketchier the shop, usually the better. This place definitely surprised us though.<//review>

<text>Oh my goodness! In San Diego there are so many great coffee ☕️ shops, but Refill is my favorite. Staff, area to work (which unfortunately is currently shut down, but such great space!), and delicious coffee. So so happy 😁 with service and product!!

The latte was good.  I really enjoyed the toast, with jam and goat cheese (all super fresh). Service was A+. It is a little pricey but someone has to pay for all the “entitled” WiFi users not buying anything ha ha.</Review>

Cool little spot. Decent amount of indoor/outdoor seating with open views of the street. Coffee is good. Warm welcoming environment. Baristas are fun & lively. Dog friendly as well. My first time here and I’ll definitely be coming back!</Text>

The coffee and snack were good, but it's difficult to find if you haven't been there before (needs more signage) *wouldn't hurt to provide a few more customer-service smiles, either</Review>

<review>I love the crepe with pesto, artichoke and roasted red peppers, and the avocado toast (I like to add a fried egg on top). The staff here is always really friendly and it's a great place to bring a book or a laptop and enjoy the San Diego sunshine on the patio. I'm not a big fan of coffee in general, but I ordered the blended drink that has espresso, peanut butter, chocolate and banana and it was really tasty.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had the chai latte and avocado toast. Tea came in a nice big mug, comforting and soothing. Avocado toast was really yummy but overpriced. Indoor and outdoor seating. Good place to study or business meet ups. Will be going back.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Here is the latest victim of the Sour Coffee Trend! Yes, they will hide behind terms like "Lighter Brew" or "Fruit Forward Acidity" but the bottom line is that the coffee is sour. Don't get me wrong, I'm always among the first to experiment and attempt tweaks with anything that's food or drink, but as much as I like trying new things, one thing in espresso culture seems to remain constant - the classic Italian espresso roast. As this could be a very long discussion, we'll leave it to the specialized forums. I'll just say that I prefer to enjoy a tasty balanced coffee instead of tearing from acidity just so I can be fashionable.
Tried a few different things here: 1) Breve Macchiato - very acidic. 2) Cortado - the acidity is diluted with much more milk, which makes it downright watery and bland 3) 2 different types of cold brew - Ethiopian (more fruitiness in the acidity, so more tolerable) and Tanzanian, which was very straightforward.
Refill uses coffee from Bird Rock roasters and they have a variety of blends, so maybe simply offer a lower acidity option as an option for patrons. Just putting that out there...
On to the food. Proof that two good things don't make a great one was my savory crepe breakfast. The menu described it as a crepe with egg, ham and Gruyere cheese. Somehow I missed the fact that there is also hummus in it. I love me some good hummus and as hummus goes, this one is pretty good but believe you me, the combo between the Swiss classic and the Middle Eastern standard is, well...underwhelming.
The paradox was continued in the crepe that my buddy Krash ordered, which had so much salty, smoky bacon that nothing else could be tasted in this otherwise beautiful plate of food. OK, I understand the temptation to give your customers more for their money, but here in the Land of Plenty sometimes less is more. This is one of those cases.
In conclusion, may I suggest that the hummus be offered as a side, and let the final user decide where to put it? Further, please reduce by half the amount of Gruyere in this recipe; add some Bechamel if you think there should be sauce in it - it will probably be a better compliment to the cheese and ham than the hummus. Ditto for the bacon.
All in all Refill is a lovely place and with very little adjustments it could be Great! Will check back in a month or so.
A year later: Either coffee has improved or I'm getting used to the lighter roasts with higher acidity. I like the coffee a bit more than initially, so I'm changing my rating from 3 to 4 out of 5. Avo toast with truffle oil doesn't hurt either. I wish they would have it on whole grain toast but let's be realistic - people love white bread.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbk5EpF47HFXVQde6dQkwkwyNyAlkr8F9MR55H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I love this place.  In my top 3 favorite Americanos in San Diego.  If you like coffee that doesn't taste like burnt cigarettes, but has a smoothness about it.  You will like this place.  Their food looks good, I've never tried it though.<//Review>

<text>There's a good reason why this place has 5-star rating. Great coffee, chill vibes, awesome staff, wi-fi, outlets, AC, indoor/outdoor seating areas. Did I say people watching?

Wasn't sure about my cold brew pick. Person behind the counter offered to try all 4.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Almond latte was foamed to the right level of milk density, and wasn't watery. The breakfast dish I ordered left a lot to be desired: the egg, avocado, sriracha and cream cheese crepe. The combination of flavours (in particular, the hot sauce) just didn't work. The hot sauce is so overpowering you can't taste anything else. The avocado isn't blended within the crepe, but rather a tiny portion on the side. The egg is baked and hard (I think a runny yolk would work better, and add more flavour). Thumbs down for this dish, thumbs up for the coffee.< /Review>

<text>Coffee is great and service is usually pretty quick, but I almost always miss when they announce my drink is ready and end up waiting way longer then I have to. The plexiglass barriers they've set up for covid make it really hard to hear when your drink is ready.< /text>< pics>

Great little place with coffee, sandwiches, and small bites. It was a nice place to sit for a bit and work on the computer. Most of the indoor tables have an outlet. The patio seating is nice if you don't need power. I'll definitely be back.< /text>

Nice atmosphere, great location, and awesome customer service. Had an almond chai tea and bacon, egg, spinach savory crepe and both were delicious. They were very kind with accommodating allergies. My mom had the apple and caramel sweet crepe and thought it was too sweet for her taste.

Power outlets and reliable wi-fi available.<//Text>

A favorite of mine. It feels like being on vacation enjoying the nice breeze and a very cool peanut butter, chocolate, and banana drink. Their food is delicious and plentifully portioned. They're pet and people friendly.<//review>

You searching for an amazing place to Enjoy some food with a friend or do some work this definitely the place. The prices are superb for tie quality and the portion you receive. It has inside and outside seatings. And outside is covered so you won’t be sitting in the sun, but definitely would enjoy the fresh breeze.<//text>

<text>Modern little cafe, not too busy when we went but still had a few people around on their laptops working quietly. Peaceful vibe. Coffee is good, husband got a chai latte and he thought it was really good. We both got brie, fig jam, bacon, etc, I got the croissant sandwich and he got the crepe. Excellent combo, definitely recommend the croissant.  Will go again if in the area!</text><Gmap_id>0x80d954e9018e009f:0x5b55ab79f9b5ee4f</Gmap_id><response>None<//response><time>1549927834952< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><user>103108104617377589238</user></record></dataset><record>

I had my first crepes here, and now I definitely understand why Aziraphale traveled to revolutionary France for just a nibble.

Had breakfast there and the food was good overall. Acai bowl was big, croissant sandwich was okay a little over priced for what you get and the crepe we tried was good.
Service was just okay that day and they really need to vacuum there vents, they were full of dust. Some dust ended up falling from the vents landing on my jacket and almost into our food.</Text>

This place is great.  I was with a group of 5 and we all kept saying how good the food is.  The decor was really nice, and I like places that have both indoor/outdoor options.  I was also surprised how quickly we got our food given we were in line behind like 8 people....I had the avocado toast and it was right on the money.< /text>

<Text>I visit Refill as a book club meeting spot one weekend a month. I get a large coffee and generally an acai bowl. Both are delicious and a little pricey but normal for the area.

There seems to be decent amount of seating inside with many people studying. The service is friendly, the space clean. Parking is difficult because of it's location</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Lovely cafe. Yummy offerings. Lots of vegan drink options. No parking for the cafe, we had to pay for parking across the street. Dogs permitted on the outside area, which is lovely for our Search Dogs. But, if you aren't into dogs you might sit inside. A perfect place to meet a friend and chat.
Update: Limited indoor seating with air conditioning. Loved the crepes.<//Text>< pics>

<text>Only 2 blocks from my apartment! Nice cappuccinos, but the coffee to milk ratio is skewed a little too much toward the milk. A little light for my taste.

Avocado toast is amazing!!

I've had a few of the crepes. The toppings are good (and abundant!) but the crepes are a bit dry.< /text>< rate>

We were visiting San Diego and stayed just a block away from this shop. We went there very morning for coffee and breakfast and very day it was delicious! The cappuccino and Nutella mocha were favorites and their savory crepes are great, especially the bacon with Brie and apples. Would go all the time if we lived there. Staff and baristas are super friendly. Highly recommend it!< /Review>

Wow. Just wow. This is a true gem. The food is reasonably priced, service very good. Presentation and taste PHENOMENAL. Key things to note: If you prefer your coffee or drink in a paper cup when you're dining in, make sure to tell the staff. Otherwise, the drink is in a stoneware cup. Also, this is located in Hillcrest. It has a VERY welcoming vibe for all walks, which was great. Loved it!!< /Text>

<Review>One of my favorite place to get cold brew coffee.  It's always fresh every time.  Food is also good there and there is outdoor seating, what's not to love?!?!< /Review>< Pics>

We had some really great lattes to go and they were probably among the best we've had. They also had crepes in all sorts of sweet and savory combinations, but didn't think they would work very well to go, so we're planning to head back to dine in.</text>

We sat outside. The service was great and the food was tasty! I didn't see any high chairs, but I didn't get around to asking for one either.

The food was amazing! I thought the prices looked a bit high for what they were offering, but when we got our meal, it was defiantly worth the money. They also have very nice mugs</Text>

<text>This is a little café that serves crepes and other items like toast, salads, and oatmeal with coffee drinks. It's a modern place, with indoor and outdoor seating. Prices are okay, but a little more than I would want.

I decided on the brie/fig jam/bacon/arugula crepe. It was made alright, but the bacon wasn't fully cooked to my liking (although it was a good portion). The crepe overall had a good mix of ingredients, but it just felt like something was missing.

It's a good average place to do some work and grab something small to eat.<//text>< Name>

Open at 6am: perfect for parents with a kiddo who doesn't know how to sleep. The coffee drinks hit the spot (chocolate milk cold brew!), and the crepes were yummy. The people are also very nice. 👍< /Review>

Great spot for a chat or work session. Good coffee, nice salad/sandwich light meal options. I enjoyed the chocolate milk coldbrew and was very tempted to buy one of the cool "refill" custom ceramic mugs. $25 is a bit out of impulse-purchase zone tho. $10-15bux, ya got me.
Anyway the seating is plentiful and there are both outdoor and indoor seats. Really appreciated how the seats along the walls all had out plugs tucked another the benches.
Oh yea and theybserve wine and mimosas if you like those things.< /Text>

< review>
I went to eat lunch at about an hour and a half ago. Nice coffee house place. I decided to have my lunch out on their patio. I ordered my food. When my food was brought to me I asked my server, a young lady wearing a black t shirt with the emblem of a brewery place called Melvin, I regret not getting her name now, but I asked her politely if she could get me a salt shaker. Her response was not only rude but to be a server it's not appropriate at all. She gave me this annoyed look and smirked at me at the same time. When she walked away a couple of women to my left saw and heard her response and they politely offered me their salt shaker at the same saying to me while shaking their heads, " here you go sweetie, I dont think she will be bringing you a salt shaker at all,". I thank them and felt embarrassed for that young woman. To be so young and already have that reaction  when she is there to serve you, well then maybe this isn't the job for her and she shouldn't be serving anyone  at all. If I do go back to this lunch place I will make sure to let her boss k ow of her attitude and conduct towards this shops patrons. Some young people need to learn and have some simple ettiquette classes.<//review>

<text>Coffee is as expected. Variety is offered and all the standards. I enjoyed the seating set up out door with a pleasant clean kept area.
It's only okay, as my crepe was mediocre. It seemed to be underdone and cold. It lacked flavor and was a bit tough...which was strange. Staff was nice and quick enough.<//text><time>1479853204436< /time>< Resp>

Great place to pick up a pick-me up caffeinated drink or a relaxing herbal tea.  Their crepes are satisfying for breakfast, brunch, or lunch after that workout you just did.  They do have Wi-Fi and it's a good place to also get some internet work done while sipping on a specially made drink.  Staff is friendly.  Another bonus is that you can also bring pets to their outdoor patio.  Perfect as a pit stop when I am walking my dog in the neighborhood.< /Text>

Upon reading the other reviews perhaps the problem is from the top down seeing how many complaints about the morbid essence of the ambience and staff there are.<//text>< Date>

<text>Went for a free HIV test at a place a few doors down and stumbled on this little cafe. Quite possibly the coolest and most hipstery cafe I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The tables are all angular and geometrical, the turquoise chairs are a great accent, and everyone is silent as they pretend to do work on their overpriced MacBook Pros. All the customers are some combination of young, attractive or well-dressed. My iced hazelnut cold brew latte came in a ceramic mug and I must say the brew tastes expensive af.

At all costs, avoid REFILL in the evenings unless you prefer a morbid environment riddled with employees who discriminate, degrade and make buying a cup of coffee & crepe an end of the world event. A $4 small, black coffee isn't worth the pain of having to deal with the bitter barista who hasn't gotten her psych meds quite down.
Worst cold brew imaginable- tastes like tap water ran through an antique shoe & gravel. Bring a toothbrush to scrape it off your teeth.

Fabulous location, gorgeous morning sunlight, but at all costs avoid the serial killer barista in the evenings!</text>

< Review>
This place is the best hands down! I took my 3 1/2 year old and 18 mos son to get haircuts and they both had an amazing time. I was concerned my son would freak out at his first haircut, so I chose this place in hopes that it would occupy my son with the car and movies and I’m so happy I stuck to this place and came here! They have a package for first haircuts that comes with a before and after. Not only did Nicole try her best to snap a perfect picture for my son’s before and after, but she was very patient with my little guy. They gave him toys to play with while he sat in the car and watched paw patrol. I brought in a picture of what I was hoping they could achieve for my my kiddos and Rhonda did excellent on both of them! She patiently cut my son’s hair and my son felt so comfortable with her the whole time! I absolutely love his hair cut! Rhonda also made my daughter feel so beautiful and so comfortable, my daughter hasn’t stopped talking about her hair cutting experience! Wish I had known about this place sooner! Highly recommend for your little ones.< /Review>

Love this place! Great haircut for a reasonable price. Plus kids can sit in fun chairs like a Jeep, plane, or car while they watch their favorite Disney movie. Girls can get a braid and/or embellishment in their hair.<//Text>

< Review>
I've brought both my kids (1yo & 3yo) here for their haircuts since moving to the area. I highly recommend them, especially for kids who have sensory, development and anxiety issues. They are patient, accommodating and friendly. The front of the place is a huge shop with toys and such and they encourage my kids to find something they like and bring it back to entertain them during the cut. It makes it hard for the kids to leave without the toy, but I'll take that over a failed haircut 😂

My youngest had one of their "my first haircut" appointments and the take-home certificate with lock of hair is super adorable (it also includes a before & after photo).<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>We took our son here for his first cut last Sunday. After the cut, before we could inspect how it looked, the stylist immediately styled his hair with product and combed it to the side. It looked decent at the time however after we got him home and he started playing around it fell forward onto his face. That’s when we saw how his hair had been butchered. His bangs are crooked, the back is uneven and there are various patches that were left un trimmed. We considered taking him back to see if a stylist could attempt to level it out but we were terrified they would just further ruin his hair. We ended up taking him to a regular salon where they could only attempt to help us being that there was no way to actually fix what they did, short of giving him a buzz cut. The ladies that work here are very nice however that does not make up for their incompetence. We will not be returning to this or any other shear madness salon & will not recommend it. I can empathize with how difficult it can be to cut a baby’s hair but that’s their profession, I would expect better.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Connie was wonderful with our daughter. Quick haircut and even styled it afterwards! The facilities are always clean, all of their chairs are fun vehicles unlike other places that only have 1 or 2, and they always have great cartoons on the TVs. Walked in at 10am on a Sunday and was out by 10:15.< /Text>

My wife and I tried just about everything that we could think of such as cutting his hair ourselves, bring him with me when I get my haircut, allow him to witness other children getting their haircut, bribe him with his favorite candies, give him the iPad, allow him to sit on our laps while getting a haircut...practically everything. Nothing has worked. Every trip to the salon resulted in crying, full anxiety, and trying to restrain our 2 year old while the hairstylist cuts his hair. Then we found Shear Madness, they were our glim of hope.  The staff were so kind and patient with us. They first suggested that we bring our son to get him acquainted without getting a haircut. When he felt comfortable, we scheduled for an appointment. The first haircut with Shear Madness was far from pleasant but the staff never once became frazzled or upset with him. They comforted my son throughout the whole process. At the end, my son gave everyone a hug, said thank you and said he would come back to see them again. Hopefully this will be the end to our haircut nightmare. Thank you Shear Madness.</Text>< pics>

<Text>I agree with so many other reviews, the salon itself is great and the ladies are very friendly  however, the quality of the haircut is very poor for the price you pay ($20 without a tip).  Each cut is only allotted 15mins and with a wiggly toddler that is simply not enough time to perform a decent haircut. We walked out of there with a jagged layered cut after asking for a single length trim.  I would find another salon or spend that $20 on a decent pair of shears.< /Text><response>None< /response>< pictures>

I went there last weekend for my daughter’s haircut and they didn’t give her shampoo or blow dry and it took maybe around 10 mins to get her hair done and without asking me about whether she wanted nail service or not they just led my daughter to the room for nails and they charged me $50 at the end so i had to pay $50 plus tips but i said over the phone when i made an appointment before i went there, I only wanted to get her haircut and the manager said the package for the haircut, nail and tattoo was thirty something dollars all together but she suddenly changed what she said when i had to pay the haircut is not included in the package and it’s separate. The manager had to speak more clearly about the price and the packages over the phone. I thought it’s too expensive compared to the services what we’ve got so when I searched online the other kids’ haircut places around my location they have all inclusive package (Shampoo, blow dry, haircut, and nails)  it’s only $29.95. I think this is a reasonable price and I think they should list their prices online too like the other places i looked it up online so the customers know clearly how much they have to pay for their services. It was not a happy visit because her nail and tattoo was all removed only after one day we visited there. I will never go back there again and i will never recommend to anybody around me. I already talked to some of my friends they live around here and they all have kids and they all said it’s too pricey.</Text>

<text>I love this place! My son is usually the one to scream bloody murder and cry, from the beginning the two ladies were very sweet my son was scared as usual and loved the fact I got to sit with my son and he was calm from the start. Lady who cut his hair is a sweetheart and very patient when he would start crying. Will definitely be going here from now on! Price was way cheaper than the other place I usually go to and always ended in a bad haircut.< /text><user>115788309650658816970</user></record>

Super great flavor and fast service. We opted for the crispy egg rolls, crispy egg noodle w/ chicken and beef, and shared a large rib eye with brisket pho out on the front patio. Will definitely repeat!<//Text>

<review>This place has gone down hill since covid. The chicken is old and taste horrible. The pho has scraps of left over meat from the day before. Save your money... They don't care about food quality anymore the order always has missing items and the Pho comes half spilled in the bag. I called and ask how old the chicken wings were and the guy laughed said thank you and hung up the phone.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1609347215260, 'text': 'Hi David, thank you for your feedback!

#16 the Rare Beef Pho soup was good but nothing exceptional. #24 Beef Stew Pho the broth was outstanding but the beef was tough and the vegetables were limited to a few pieces of carrot. #A3 Shrimp Spring rolls again were ok, clean tasting, however, the peanut sauce was bland.< /review>

Excellent spring rolls. Freshly made And very tasty. Great vegan options too. There's always room, and the service is quick. The atmosphere could use a little improvement, they have some fish tanks with big goldfish that don't look too happy. But overall the food is great.< /text>

<review>If your looking for some of the most unauthentic pho in San Diego, look no further.

I ordered a #20 chicken pho. Let's start with the broth. Watered down and flavorless. There was nearly no chicken in the order and what was there was sadly similar to the broth, flavorless. The noodles they use seem to be some of the cheapest ones you can buy.

There are Many Many Many Delicious pho restaurants, if not in the are close by.

I hope this review informs future customers, but more importantly I really thing this establishment improves on the issues.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

First off let me say that it's very hard to please my husband when we look for a pho place but they got him to eat his whole bowl!!  They even accommodate to giving me my rare beef on the side, I love rare beef pho but usually when I get it it's already been cooked by the broth.  All was delicious and I would highly recommend to friends.</review>

Place the order when you walk in and the food will be ready in just a few minutes. You can also call ahead but the quick service means your food can be waiting for a little while until you arrive for pickup. The large express combination #1 is a great deal and tastes very yummy.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>how does this place have such good reviews?  I'm extremely lenient with my rating but the food was awful. I feel that the noodles where cooked in the morning and left in a togo cup all day because they are form fitted to my cup and will not separate. the pork egg rolls are like chewy rubber. this place definitely gave me the leftover lunch rush food. I'll try it again in a month or whenever they get air conditioning.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Ordered for take out... Over $30 for only 2 of us. When we got home (about 8 traffic lights away) we opened up a tight wrapped package (so we couldn't confirm what it was) and it was not at all what we ordered.
Well, we tried it anyways and whatever it was, it was horrible. Extremely disappointing!!! Be sure to bring a translator with you if you go... but whatever you do... DON'T GO!!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<text>I'm a loyal long time customer! If you're new to pho, get the #17! Grilled Pork Spring Rolls are amazing. I've become a vegetarian and still visit for their veggie pho with veggie broth (be sure to specify veggie broth or you might get beef) and their veggie egg rolls are pretty decent too!</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< userid>

Pho Time has some pretty tasty soup. We usually come here because they have a delicious selection of boba smoothie drinks in addition to our favorite varieties of pho.
I always go for the #2 (a bigger bowl with the most meat, get it without tripe if you aren't very adventurous), while my lady likes to keep it healthy with the veggie option.
Service is always super quick and parking is much easier than most spots in PB.< /text>

Of the many Vietnamese restaurants in PB and La Jolla, this hidden gem tops my short list.  Located in a quiet corner of Pacific Plaza next to the Enterprise Car Rental, this family owned restaurant serves up high quality authentic cuisine which is consistent and affordable.  The Pho is excellent and the fresh spring rolls are second only to Brodard in Westminster. My favorite is the grilled pork. Don't confuse this place with the Green Papaya which occupied this space previously.  Pho Time introduced good food, comfortable seating and lots of friendliness to this quiet oasis in the middle of busy PB.  The restaurant is airy with high ceilings, lots of booths and exotic fish tanks.  Check out the rare fish with the giant lump.  You won't be disappointed.</Text>

Pho is good as well, this was the first place I ever had pho so it is special to me.

Calm, mostly quiet atmosphere; good place if you need pho because you are sick (lots of space between the tables and not loud).<//text>< pics>

Simply the "weakest" tasting Phó I've ever had!!! #disappointeddddd Oh and BEWARE that the spring rolls are wrapped in some kind of "clear" wrapper, made of only God himself knows what. And they taste funny. I didn't try the "peanut butter" looking sauce they came with! The calamari was GRRROSSSSS! Thick and rubbery to say the LEAST. The only remotely tasty thing about it was the breading. #Mistakeeee OH & don't fall for that high priced ONE DOLLAR SEVENTY-NINE CENTS pop - it's a CAN!!!!!!! - Long story short a WASTE of money!!!!!!!!!!!!! #neverrrragain< /Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>one of the classier pho places in SD.

overall, I thought my pho had wonderful flavor. i was swayed by a posted photo of the seafood pho -- but I wouldnt recommend getting as a majority (all?) of the seafood was "seafood." it had things that looked like lobster, looked like scallops, etc...but please, for the price tag I should have known better :) I guess most of this stuff is seafood paste of some variety and has a congealed tofu-like texture. maybe it is tofu, i dont know.

but even though everything was mock seafood (except the shrimp...pretty sure that was shrimp but ive been amazed by vegan "shrimp" so who knows) it still has a higher price tag than standard items like the rare beef or chicken - $8.50 I believe. I'm not saying it didnt taste good, I just dont think its worth it. I'll come back and get the aforementioned instead. Someone in my party got the chicken and really enjoyed - said it was basically an entire white meat chicken in there.

my cousin raved about "complimentary" side bread for dipping. i believe its the bread used for the Banh mì's. ya well...its not complimentary, they charge $1.50 for it. definitely good but not worth the price. ill admit my dining for pho is mainly for cheap, quick, and delicious. so when i pay unnecessary extras like "seafood" and "bread" to make it over $10, i realize i did it wrong. also, if my tummy is gonna hurt from the weirdness of components and MSG one way or another, it might as well be cheap!

all in all, pho time is worthy of its popularity...just make sure you order right. i was also given the heads up from a friend to order the rare beef on the side and put in on your own to ensure it doesnt get overcooked. good idea!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>It's been a hot minute since I've been here last. The food was as exceptional as always and the service was immaculate. All the staff my party and I interacted with was friendly, helpful, and happy. Everyone, staff and guests alike, are just happy to be either working or out enjoying time out with friends and family. I know my party and I were happy to be out.

There were obvious modifications to the environment because of COVID, but that didn't matter in the grand scheme of things. It was a grand ol' time being out!<//Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Great food, great staff! They looked a little short handed but with the pandemic an all that, they were pretty quick an service was great. Food was hot an delicious, I also expected the bill to be much larger than it was. Over all, this is a great place to sit down an grab a tasty bite to eat! I will definitely be back!< /text><rating>5< /rating><UserId.>111582392967706456445< /UserId.></record>

<Review>Burger was cooked perfect sweet potato fries not so much! They were cold and had been cooked in old grease as had our onion rings. They were  an extra charge. Our server was very attentive until we were served our meal. No dishes removed they just kept stacking up. Our bill dropped off and picked up still a table full of dishes.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dafd556fc1d77d:0xc380cd02bd4a5fdd</gmap_id>< Resp>

Place was too packed. We ended up at Maracas. Glad we did. We really do like Red Robin.  I guess our timing wasn't right.  On the lighter note we had a blast trying something new. They were able to accommodate 17 of us on the spot.<//review>

Love their burgers and endless sides. Try the garlic fries. Real tasty. The Tavern burgers are very good and won't break your budget. It also includes the endless sides.< /Text>

Sat in the bar because they were busy. The guy running the bar was on it today and did it ALL for that whole section. Great experience - fast, friendly service. Excellent hot food. Give that guy a raise!< /text>

<text>Ordered drink, burger and fries. My server was Chris H who has to be in the top 2 ultimate worst servers. He made me wait forever and then cut me off short while ordering saying he had other things to do. Hurried me up while I waited nearly 1/2 hour before ordering. The restaurant wasn’t even full. What a waste of my hard earned money on the absolute most awful fries and cold burger. Very disappointed. Yuck!!!<//text>< pictures>

This place knows what it means to be a team. Our server was extremely pleasent and knowledgeable of the menu. Prebussed and refilled without us being able to notice. The food amazing. Manageras are out helping where they could and making themselves available to customers. Class acts all the way we will be back!</Text>

Curbside service is still in place herr. I was offered extra fries. That has never happened since I've been ordering Curbside/Online since the beginning of the shutdowns. My sandwich, California Chicken, was perfect. here. Service.< /review>

<review>Delicious food. Great place to get a substantial vegetarian burger (a vegetarian patty can be substituted for any burger). You can also pick options for buns/lettuce wrap, extra veggies, and bottomless sides. Best of all, if you are a rewards member, you can get a free burger during your borthday month!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Delicious food. Great place to get a substantial vegetarian burger (a vegetarian patty can be substituted for any burger). You can also pick options for buns/lettuce wrap, extra veggies, and bottomless sides. Best of all, if you are a rewards member, you can get a free burger during your borthday month!< /review>

I usually love Red Robin but my Reds Tavern Double today tasted like it came from McDonalds, and I do not mean that as a compliment. I’m sure there are extra challenges with everything going on, but the quality was not there. Feel like I wasted precious cash. 🙁</text>

Food was not as ordered, again. This facility has continued to demonstrate inconsistency in actually providing what is ordered for pick up or delivery. We've been assured each time, it won't happen again; it always does.

To stay happy when buying from this restaurant, follow these guidelines: Order menu items exactly as offered, do not use option of "on the side", or "hold mayonnaise or red sauce", and you may possibly get what you order. A shame in 2020, a franchise like Red Robin is less able to do "special" order than McDonald's or Burger King.</Review>

Red Robin is a classic choice but I want to talk about the service here. This location was staffed with such a great and responsive staff. From being seated to the pursuit of our complete customer satisfaction, I just can't stress how well we were treated here. Thank you for your hospitality!</review>

We had the Alaskan Cod fish and chips and I must say their's have risen to my favorite in the valley. Not too breaded, not oily but crisp, the tartar sauce was excellent and then the endless fries. I can only eat about one or two wedges and that's it; but very nice to offer. We sat at the bar during this visit since they have nice high chairs at the bar as well as bistro tables. I mention this for those of us who have trouble getting out of chairs lower to the floor. The bartender was excellent and checked back often to see how we were doing. I will put this place on my list when I want fish and chips or my partner a hamburger.
Easy access for those on wheelchairs. The bar has a lower section to eat at. Nice set up.< /Text>

<review>It's been quite a while since I've been to red Robin. It's never been that great of a franchise. I must say, this visit I had the mad love burger. Great flavors! Even better service by the waitress. I asked for well done fries, they delivered! Good food, good service, updated menu is really dynamic. I'll definitely be coming back. Noticed another reviewer mention Marlene (mar-leh-nah) and I must second, she is among the best servers anywhere.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN96D-Yv4b-vZgjXmH_iwmK-4-LaoO3lS17Yg8w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dafd556fc1d77d:0xc380cd02bd4a5fdd</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We ate at the Palm Desert location. Server was really nice. The food was just OK the gourmet burger at $12 apparently was once frozen, Sweet potato fries were once frozen, zucchini fries frozen, more breading than  zucchini, the steak fries once frozen. And for desert, the chocolate brownie was also once frozen.......only the ice cream was an acceptable frozen item.
Maybe the salads are fresh.< /review>

I give 5 stars to Juan Carlos. He cooked my cheeseburger to perfection. His presentation was amazing. Our server made sure we never ran out of their bottomless all you can eat steak fries, and the Manager Jose goes way and beyond to accommodate the customers and his positive attitude is contagious and hes a great motivater and team player with the employees.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This is in my opinion the best Red Robin in the valley. The food is great, the price is fair-- but it's the employees that make the Rancho Mirage store my favorite. I place a to go order every weekend with Alexa and I cannot say enough good things about her. She is always super nice, very friendly, my order is always correct and everyone up front always has a nice smile and friendly words. The people truly do make the difference.< /Review></record>

So disappointing, I've eaten here several times over the years and have always been satisfied.  I had a pitiful meal of Fish & Chips that had 4 smallish remnants of Cod that were coated in the strangest batter, eatable but far from enjoyable.  My dining companion had a bacon cheese burger and found it disappointing as well.  Service was good but apparently this place has  begun to serve overpriced mediocre food.</text>

Really friendly service, the burger options are very impressive and you can't go wrong with endless fries!  The servers were completely on top of making sure our fries we're topped up regularly.</Text>

I don't know when things changed, but I remember the Red Robbin quality being much better. With the addition of all their new hamburgers, options, etc, I feel the food is just not the same. Service is always great when coming here.<//review>

They sat us, took our order, no rush, no fuss.  Everyone was professional.  The place was adequately clean.  Our serve was friendly and polite, despite the fact that we were still there well after they had closed.  Food was good.  Nothing extra special but nothing to complain about.   Just your typical Red Robin plus a team of kick ass staff and a couple of stellar margaritas.  Friday night; check.  Put that kid to bed.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Best Red Robin I've ever been too. The food was amazing and made exactly how I asked. They have fantastic beers on tap and their bartender, Tessa, made me feel like I was her favorite regular even tho I had never been to this location before and it was the day after Thanksgiving. Great staff, seriously. Phenomenal service and the best munchie meal I've had in a minute. Highly recommend this spot!! Chat with Tessa in the bar!<//Text>

Ordered the lettuce wrap burger....the burger was as cold as the iceberg lettuce it was wrapped in and tougher than the doles of my work shoes.  Was to have guac on it but it was a no show.  Garlic fries made up for it though...real tasty so that brings me to the 3 Star rating.  Our waitress was the best too#<//Text>

The spicy burger wasn't spicy enough. Even my 16 year old daughter said it was weak. The requested dipping ghost sauce didn't turn my mouth into fire.
Red Robin yumm was yummy enough. Want it more ghost hot next time...</review>

<text>My server was extremely pleasant and professional.  First time visit. I'll be back. The burger and fries were top notch as was the root beer float. Great job folks!           Very unfortunate update folks! Visited this location this afternoon and absolutely everything was completely terrible. From the tasteless onion rings to the usually refreshing sugar free peach iced tea to the tasteless, lackluster Monster burger and even the tasteless fries! Let's not forget the unpleasant older lady server with her phoney smile! Now I can understand why this chain is in very serious trouble.  The quality of their products and customer service has dramatically plummeted.  Scratch this one off the list folks!< /text>< Time>

<review>I love Red Robin's Royalty Rewards! Free burger on my birthday and free item (salad, soup, burger) for every 10 you buy! My personal favorite burgers are the Black and Bleu and Guacamole Bacon Burger. I love that they have fried pickles and I also love their onion ring stacks! This place is great for large parties and the staff always accommodates us well!<//review></record>

This Palm Desert location is the best Red Robin we have ever been too. The service, atmosphere, and food are 5 Star plus.  We have visited this restaurant, off and on, over the last 8 years. Not once have we been disappointed.  Good Job!!<//review>

<review>I've had a hit-or-miss experience with this particular Red Robin. The food quality is usually pretty good and the ambience is fun. The pricing, while not cheap, is reasonable for what you get. Overall I'd give this place a four star rating were it not for the service. There are times when it is great, and times when it is abysmal. Some of the servers are really on top of things, while some clearly would rather be somewhere else. A little work on weeding out the unmotivated servers would make me want to come here a lot more often.</review><time>1519606145702< /time><response>None< /response><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Jarrod Kailef<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I've had mixed experiences. The food is always good. But the wait staff can be very attentive or non existant. The location is convenient. The food is great. The restaurant is clean. Overall, it's a good place.</Review>

<review>Have not been to this location before. The service was very good. Ordered the tavern mac & cheese entre. Very disappointing. It was a small bowl and only 2/3 filled. The bigger issue was how dry it was, almost no cheese sauce. The pasta was cooked well, but the cheese was not to be found. Would not recommend this food item.</review>< Pictures>

I love to eat here, staff are friendly and funny.  They make my experience worth coming back for more. I highly recommend RedRobbin to all my friends and family and I would recommend it to you. They have happy hour a bar where you can have drinks and TVs where you can watch a game.< /Text>

< review>
Came to Red Robin’s on Veteran’s Day last week and they were pretty busy but that’s only because they have one of the best Veteran’s Day deals. You receive a free burger (limited but not by much) and fries. You have to pay for your drink but you won’t even notice because of how tasty their burgers are. Their fries are excellent as well which is hard to find if the burgers are just as good. They even ask if you want ranch for your fries!! I also want to give a shoutout to all the servers that were working on the day on question. It was crowded and we basically had a free meal but that didn’t stop them from giving the best possible service they could. Right on!< /review>

I think the kitchen has stopped caring, the food looks and tastes like it. I'm done, never returning. Third strike, now I post your failure online and move on.< /text><Time>1554738439520< /Time><name>Josh Herbel</name></record>

Consistently great burgers (bunless style) and awesome sweet potato fries. Host, however, took an inordinate amount of time to seat 3 separate parties of 2, 3 and 1! Waited about 10 minutes to be seated in restaurant with loads of empty tables! Then advised table had just been wiped down so "beware!" Forgot to tell me that seats were wet, as I slid in and legs were slimed! Yuch! A quick wipe down with the ever present paper towel would have taken them seconds!! Also, it is about 100° outside and the restaurant is frigid!! Way too cold for comfort! This is also a consistent pattern...and regrettable. Please stop setting thermostat for staff running around sweating and instead accommodate customers who are sitting here freezing!!!<//text>

We stopped at this one on our way to Niland.  The service was very slow on a Monday, hardly anyone in the place and the food was luke warm by the time we received it.  It took about 40 minutes for us to get our food.  We ordered our burger with some pink and they were barely cooked, all pink!  The fries were barely warm and asked for some hot fries right away.  My sister had the Cobb salad on my recommendation because I love Red Robin's Cobb salad, she said it had very little taste.  It was mostly lettuce, the bacon crumbs and other items on the salad were chopped so fine she could not taste them.  The server was very attentive and a nice guy, very apologetic.  He gave is a $15 credit since we got cold undercooked food.  I had a hanger 24 beer that was fantastic though, first time trying it.  It was not one bit bitter and just a hint of orange, so good.  I will be seeking out this beer.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dafd556fc1d77d:0xc380cd02bd4a5fdd< /GmapID></record>

Our appitites have shrunk so sharing is perfect. We sit in the bar area which seems a bit more quiet for us "older" people who don't appreciate loud kids/families.

<Review>I love Red Robin normally, but this place is kinda "meh". It is not exactly clean, there are always fries and bread on the floors. The service is not the best, we had to wait 15 just for the hostess to come back to the pedestal. Then I had to ask the bartender for a refill because the server didn't come around. Food is still good.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dafd556fc1d77d:0xc380cd02bd4a5fdd< /GmapID></record>

Amazing burgers and sandwiches. The Cowboy Tavern Double is juicy and delicious with bbq sauce and ranch. One of the best burgers I've had from a chain/franchise place.</Text>

The bottomless fries came in tiny portions so we were constantly asking for more. Refills were hard to come by, so much so that since I  was sitting with the kids separated from the adults, I never received a refill on my water. The mushrooms on my burger were rubbery and tasteless, the cheese looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.< /review><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

Red Robin Gourmet Burgers is a relaxing fun place to enjoy a delicious burger.  The service  was fast and even offered some fries while I waited for my meal.</review>

Really great service and beer selections. Only downside is they ran out of crayons for the kids which is obviously a problem if you are bringing kids (sounds like it’s been a long term issue) but is easily fixable.  I would still return because the service was great.<//Review>

Was always a fun place to eat, but it's just too pricy for a fast food flavor.  Sorry...  our booth was dirty as well.<//Review>

Red Robin is a great place for burgers and more!  The company seems to be consistent throughout the various locations.  Their free loyalty club is wonderful.  Many burgers choices, from size to toppings but havent EVER had a bad one.  Bottomless fries, they are known for but they have bottomless substitutions for those avoiding carbs.

House made salads, fish and chips, great shakes and desserts round out the menu with something for everyone.  If you can't decide, try Red's Tavern Double for a great juicy burger w/fries at 6.99.  And dont forget to check the loyalty club.  Every 10th burger on ur account is free!  Enjoy Red Robin!</Text>

Total complete waste of time. Just looking to have a nice meal but waitress was so rude and had no sense of customer service. Very unfriendly and when we ordered the burger there was RAW CLEAR GOOP from the egg and mayo when we asked for none. Once we told her about the mayo she said “you didn’t ask to hold the mayo but okay.” We ended getting up and leaving. I’m just warning you, go somewhere else!!!!< /review>

<text>Large variety of burgers, chicken sandwiches, appetizers, beer, and many other things. It's pretty much a standard Red Robin, so if you have been to others, it will look very similar. My husband and I always stop here when we're driving from Phoenix to LA, because it's a good distance to take a break. There is also a Costco store and gas station across the street, so we can fill up both our tummies and our car during the same stop.<//text>< pics>

We always go there after Costco.  The kids like the bottomless mac and cheese (pizza isn't bottomless).  We also upgrade the kids' drinks to shakes for dessert.< /Text>

Large variety of burgers, chicken sandwiches, appetizers, beer, and many other things. It's pretty much a standard Red Robin, so if you have been to others, it will look very similar. My husband and I always stop here when we're driving from Phoenix to LA, because it's a good distance to take a break. There is also a Costco store and gas station across the street, so we can fill up both our tummies and our car during the same stop.<//Text>

This red robin progressively gets dirtier and dirtier.  The carpets are beyond cleaning. Every surface has that greasy spoon feel. I wish the manager would get his head out of his or her butt and get the staff to clean once and a while.  It is a filthy restaurant.< /Text>

Slow, no, I mean sssssllllloooooowwwww. Our waiter, Nicolas was very good but appeared to be overloaded with tables. He did the best he could under the circumstances. Some of the food came out cold, they fixed it but, by the time it was brought out, the rest of the party were done eating. We received an apology from the manager.<//Text>

This place was horrible.... Everyone at our table received everything they ordered and EVERYTIME I asked for something or ordered something she "forgot" I finally gave up on my meal Bc after a 4 hr drive through the desert it would of been nice to have a good meal and service coming into town but I guess I was wrong!!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!</Review>

< review>
Small parking lot for this restaurant​, in front of it though shares parking from the movie theaters. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and asked my party size and seating preference. Inside of the building was very clean and the staff was professionally dressed and friendly.

We sat at a bar booth and ordered drinks. Tables were clean and there is a kiosk at each table. Our waiter arrived and introduced herself and made us aware of happy hour and specials, very informative.

I ordered a beer, miller light in a tall glass for $4.50. They do not have a real good selection of alcohol, im surprised red robins have typically always been that way.

I ordered a burger and it was pretty busy. Shockingly wait time was very short! The burger was excellent too. Only thing I do not like is if you get fries with your meal, they give you a very small amount of fried in a small silver holder. Fries with a meal are bottomless meaning you can get as much as you want, just be prepared to ask your waiter multiple times to get more. If they just served a normal chunk of fries like they use to in the past that is typically enough to satisfy your french fry hunger.

Prices are great for what is provided, defenitely a good value. Once finished with my meal I could pay with the kiosk and even split the check with guests through the kiosk, as well as enter rewards phone number and what not. This is a great options because one of my pet peeves at any restaurant is when you pay with a card, you have to wait for the bill to be brought to you, wait for waiter to process it, come back and hand it back to write a tip. Usually when im done eating im ready to go and get impatient.

Great visit overall with some minor issues such as the lack of fries offered. Not enough to ruin the 5 star rating that they deserve here.<//review>

The food was horrible the service poor and the booths were so small that you could barely get in them. We showed up on Saturday and had to wait over 45 minutes for a table I don't know if all the Red Robin's would like that but from my experience there I will never go back to this one if I could rate it zero I would<//review>

(Translated by Google) Complaint of the red robin restaurant !!
$ 1 - 92234

I do not sell anything!
I just want to show my disagreement, from the Red Robin restaurant ... we went to dinner there, about 30 min ago. We were 9 people, pure family, We arrived and the waitress arrived to take the order, and we asked her to wait 5 min to look at the drinks menu, but at that time, (please ask her if she could put the football game ) At that time other people arrived (Americans) and went to attend them, passed the 5 min. And the waitress didn't come back, it happened like 30 min. Until I talk to him, what if he could take our order and I told him why was it taking so long? That because they served them first and left us last, I answered that because we asked him to put the game and he was doing that, then I told him, that she was serving the after people, that she was not the one who I was putting it was another waiter who brought control of the television and changed the channel for football. Finally, my daughter told her that because she was so Racist, she really discriminated against us, called the manager and the manager told us that if we didn't like us to leave, and I want to ask you if please have the number of something in place where we can complain, like customer service to something like that, please give me phone numbers or something like that,

Beforehand! Thank you !

Solo quiero mostrar mi inconformidad, del restaurant Red Robin.. fuimos a cenar ahi, hace como 30 min. Íbamos 9 personas, pura familia, Llegamos y llegó la mesera a tomar la orden, y le pedimos que esperara  5 min para mirar la carta de las bebidas, pero en ese momento, (le pedimos por favor que si podía poner el partido de fútbol)en ese momento llegaron otras personas (Americanos) y se fue a atenderlos a ellos, pasaron los 5 min. Y la mesera no regresaba, pasó como 30 min. Asta que le hable, que si nos podía tomar la orden y le dije que porque se avía tardado tanto? Que porque a ellos les sirvió primero y a nosotros nos dejó por último, me contesto que porque nosotros le pedimos que pusiera el partido y andaba haciendo eso, entonces le dije,  que ella andaba sirviendo a las tras personas ,que ella no era la que lo estaba poniendo fue otro mesero el que trajo el control de la televisión y le cambio de canal para el fútbol. Por último le dijo mi hija que por se estaba portento tan Racista, la verdad si lo hiso, nos discriminó, llamo al gerente y el gerente nos dijo que si no nos gustaba que nos fuéramos, y yo le quiero pedir a ustedes que si por favor tienen el número de algo en lugar donde podamos quejarnos, como servicio al consumidor a algo así, por favor me den números de teléfono ho algo así,

De ante mano! Muchas gracias !</text>
