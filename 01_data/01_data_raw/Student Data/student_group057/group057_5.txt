< review>
I’ve had bad experiences with dentists and dental offices in the past.

Recently, I had a dentist say I had 7!!!! Cavities. This didn’t make any sense because I take really good care of my teeth. Even though I hadn’t been to the dentist in a couple years, this didn’t seem right.

So my dad recommended I get a second opinion from Alex. I’m glad I did! It turned out the x rays the last dentist took were not good, and that upon another set of x rays and a visual exam I had just 1 cavity!

There’s a lot of BS in the dental industry, and you need a dentist you can trust to not over treat, and that’s why I’d recommend Alex.

The other things I love about the office is the friendly helpful staff, decor and overall vibe.  This is everything I want from the dental experience and that’s why I come here.

I've been coming to this practice since I have had teeth (40+ years) Dr. Victor Chaney has been my dentist, now he's retired his son Dr. Alex Chaney has taken over and the transition has been excellent.  He's very knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great dentist.< /review>

Dr. Vic and his son Dr. Alex are the best!  I’ve been going there for years. I’ve had many crowns and it’s always been a pain free experience. Diane is a wonderful hygienist, and Mary in the front office is always friendly and helpful. Just a wonderful dental office.<//Text>

Great family dentistry.  This has been my Dentistry for over 35 years . Eventhough I moved out of the bay area 20 yrs again, I continue to use their service. The staff is as amazing as the service they provide. I get a complete Dental evaluation at least once a year well as regular teeth cleaning. And my teeth and gums are healthy thanks to talented dental staff.<//Review>

I always have a great experience coming into Dr. Chaney's office. He provides gentle care for my teeth and answers my questions thoroughly. Jessica, who was my hygienist that day was gentle on my teeth and pleasant to talk to as well. There's also some nice, interesting artwork in the waiting room and dental rooms for patients to enjoy. Would recommend this office to anybody :)< /review>

< Review>
I'm so grateful that they take such good care of my dad. He has a hard time getting into low dental chairs because of his hip replacement, and they always go above and beyond both to help him with his mobility issues and make sure he always gets the best possible dental care. I also appreciate that they meet him where he is at with his ability to care for himself. He's getting older and it's hard for him to floss and brush as well because of dexterity issues after his stroke, so they've focused on preventive care things to help preserve his dental health to accommodate that.</Review>

Visiting dentists was always one of the most dreaded activities for me. Dr Chaney , however, completely eliminated my fear. All staff members, the receptionists and doctors alike, were extremely personable and (most importantly in my opinion) GENTLE throughout the entire procedures (a few fillings and a root canal). During my visit, I received a thorough consulting not only on my treatment plan, but also on the estimated bills based on my insurance coverage. The staff members were very communicative before and after my visit, so a huge shout out to Dr.Chaney and his staff on Excellence and  giving me the opportunity to ask any questions and my new million dollar smile.

The clinic is very clean and absolutely adheres to the COVID standards. Highly recommended.< /text>

I’ve been a patient for many years of Dr Chaney’s . Both father Vic and now his son Alex. I’m never fearful of having a procedure done with either DDS., which is saying something. The cleaning today with Mandy was the best! All staff are friendly, professional and feel like family. I’m never having to wait. Mary schedules appointments perfectly. I don’t mind driving up from Oakland to stay with this office. Highly recommend!<//review>

My husband and I had our bi-annual exam and cleaning done by Dr. Alex Chaney this week. He took great care in examining and cleaning our teeth. In every step he asked if we were comfortable. We truly appreciated his concern. This has only been our second office visits and we are confident to say that we have found a great dentist. We greatly recommend Dr. Alex Chaney to anyone who needs an efficient and caring dentist.</Review>

<text>The folks in that office are the most caring, conscientious and loving people ever!! A piece of porcelain broke off my bridge just a few days before I had to leave on a three-week vacation. I was worried that this would cause an infection & pain if I did not have it taken care of. It was a Friday, the office was closed, and the coming Monday was Columbus Day, the office would be closed as well. I called anyway, and got emergency phone numbers for both Dr. Vic & Dr. Alex. I texted both of them and explained my situation. Not even 5 minutes later, Dr. Vic phoned me. He was taking taking one of his marathon walks! He told me he would be in the office on Monday morning and would see me then! No pain, no worries! Thank you Dr. Vic!!!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I recently relocated to Vallejo. Concurrently my dentist in Oakland retired. I asked a friend for a recommendation and he recommended the Dr.s Chaney office. I yelped and googled them and found 4+ star reviews. I made an appointment on Tuesday for an examination on Friday. I was treated by Dr. Victor Chaney. I was greeted by Mary and X-rayed by Chris (sp?). All 3 made me feel welcome and calm. Dr. Victor Chaney gave me the most thorough and complete examination I have ever had and I'm 70 years old. Going in I knew there were at a couple things needing attention so I wasn't surprised when Dr. Chaney presented the list of corrective actions. As I approach my first treatment I do so with a sense of confidence that I have found the right Dr. for me.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I had my first appointment here yesterday and I was super impressed. The Dentist spent at least an hour and a half with me really getting to know me on a personal level. He gave me my check up and then did my cleaning because he had an extra few minutes! Who does that? It didn't hurt that he was super cute in his bowtie and patiently put up with my friendly bantering about the global uses of fluoride.<//Text>< gmap_id>

When I first visited the office, I was concerned about an open contact (gap) between two teeth. Dr Alex explained that he could do a filling if I wanted, but suggested that we "wait and see" for now, since there wasn't any decay and he didn't want to disrupt the enamel of a healthy tooth. The staff are fantastic, and Dr Vic's rolling ball sculptures in the waiting room are a must-see. Highly recommended!<//Text>< pics>

Diane cleaned my teeth today and does a great job. Dr. Alex came in after to check for any issues and put my mind to rest over concerns I had regarding another health issue I thought might effect my teeth. Both, Dr. Vic and Dr. Alex, are awesome. They truly care about your health and your mouth can reveal a lot. I wouldn't consider letting anyone else be in charge of my dental needs! I recomend them to anyone who is looking for great dentists.</Text>

I have been going to Chaney dentistry for a decade.  They are well-trained, highly-skilled dentists who are friendly and caring.  Moderate prices.  Probably the best dentists in Vallejo.< /text>

<Text>I had neglected my teeth for years.  The last time I visited a dentist was over four years ago and was guilty of irregular brushing and flossing.  I decided to search for a Dentist that I could call my primary and begin a new regiment of taking care of my teeth.

I found Doctor Alex Chaney and I was not disappointed.

What impressed me first from the Chaney & Chaney Dentistry website was the link to the beautiful artwork by Doctor Alex and innovative creations by Doctor Victor, his father.  It struck me that it would be brilliant to have a Dentist who was not only knowledgeable but also an Artist--for surely to obtain beautiful teeth would require the hands and eye of an artist so much as the knowledge of a doctor.  It also appealed to me to be a patron of a family business.

Doctor Alex's assistant Tamara was a delight from the moment I was called into the office.  With her radiant smile and personality, she was able to put my feelings of unease aside.  Very deftly and professionally, she obtained the required x-rays, in no time at all.

Doctor Alex told me he prides himself on being unjudgmental and kind--as well he should--for he indeed personifies these traits.  He is knowledgeable, patient, dapper and very interesting to talk to.  A lot of my fears were dispelled and my treatment was not as bad as I envisioned, (one cavity.)  What impressed me most  was that Doctor Alex was able to clean and treat my cavity all in one sitting!  There was no pain and I felt completely at ease with his confidant touch.

I left feeling like I had accomplished a lot all in one day!   I am grateful.

Thank you Doctor Alex!</Text><Time>1544160734123<//Time>< GmapID>

Always a wonderful greeting from Mary. She always knows exactly what is going on and has the information to help. Staff is on top of everything Dr. Alex is doing the practice/business proud!< /review>

A few years ago I moved out of town and thus aimlessly tried to find a comparable dentist - which I never found. Like most, I go to the dentist with a bit of angst, however the moment I walk in to Dr. Chaney's office I am at ease. My last appointment was with Dr. Alex whom I had never seen before. He was very friendly, professional and personable. He listened to all of my concerns/comments and addressed them in the upmost caring manor (better yet, his explanations were "patient friendly" rather than robotic). I left the my appointment feeling content and confident and naturally, with a beaming smile! It's true there's no place like home, it is equally true, there's no place like Dr. Chaney's office!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I’ve been with the Chaney family for ~20 years, first with Victor Chaney, and now with his son Alex, who are both realible and skilled. I have not had a healthcare office that is as friendly and personal at this one.

Entrance is filled with prize winning electro-mechanical creations from Dr. Chaney. Worth a visit just to see them.</text>

I made an order online, the service was great I only live one block away that is why I decided to order as a carry out, I refuse to cook on the weekends, the food was good I mean it's Domino's it's only pizza! And it's cheap, what would you expect for that a gourmet pizza?, Overall I'm satisfied, I used a coupon where you can get two items for 5.99 and if you want a specialty pizza for only two dollars more you can get two medium specialty pizzas, so I did I got the Xtravaganza with all kinds of ingredients and the Philadelphia pizza and I added spicy chicken pinapple bites with JALAPENIO  for 5.99 it was good and cheap 🤗🍕🍕🍕😃 up</Text>

I’m writing this while I wait for the pizza that they said was ready 10 minutes ago. Dough lady asked if I was here for a pickup I said yes, she went back to throwing dough. Person up front was on the phone but must have assumed she took care of it cause he went on to make boxes. Another woman came out from in back and asked again then she disappeared. About 10 more mins go by and someone new comes out and finally give me my order. The app said the pizza was ready before I ever left the house. While this is likely my last time here, it’s not the worst. One time I stood there in front of two people at the counter for five minutes before they even acknowledged I was there. It’s average pizza at an above average price, Just throw in some courtesy.

<user_name>Douglas Hansen</user_name><review>I had their 7.99 carry out special with three toppings pineapple mushroom and spinach. When I got to my destination about 10 minutes later I opened the box and had my first bite only to notice it didn't seem fresh at all nor did it have the taste quality as I experienced before. I can usually gobble up the entire 799 Pizza by myself but I could hardly eat one third before getting sick to my stomach. Needless to say the entire next day I was sick to my stomach I couldn't eat all day and was limited to seven up .... several times when I called and asked for a refund I was told they needed to talk to another manager and this went on throughout the day only to be told that they will call me the next morning.... Approximately 24 hours has gone by and no offering of refund. I can't recommend this place because the food quality is questionable and I got sick to my stomach and I don't know when it's safe for me to eat again and further their customer service stinks.</review>< pictures>

<Text>IVE BEEN ORDERING PIZZA HERE FOR YEARS.. FOR THE MOST PART NO COMPLAINTS; HERE LATELY- IVE CHANGED MY VIEW OF THIS PARTICULAR DOMINOES..
i HAD 2 SEPARATE INCIDENTS THAT WERE REAL WRONG WITH NO KIND OF RESOLUTION OR EVEN AN APPOLOGY ..SHAME ON ME FOR GIVING THEM THE 2ND CHANCE.  AND UNLESS SOME ONE MAKES GOOD ON THIER WORD I WAS GIVEN"TO CREDIT ME NEXT TIME"- I WONT BE DOING BUSINESS AGAIN WITH THIS DOMINOES ESPECIALLY.
i ORDERED A 3 TOPPING MED. FOR 7.99. MY USUAL ORDER LATELY.
I STATED THAT I WOULD COME GET IT FOR CARRY OUT...AS THE FIRST INCIDENT INVOLVED AN ORDER FOR DELIVERY THAT AFTER  2 HRS. AND AT LEAST 3 FOLLOW UP CALLS TO CHECK THE STATUS OF MY ORDER AND CONFIRM MY ADDRESS AND CHECK WHERE THE DRIVER WAS AT...I ENDED UP DRIVING DOWN THERE AND CANCELING MY ORDER.  AFTER ALL THAT IT- WAS TOO LATE TO GET ANYTHING ELSE TO EAT ANY PLACE NEARBY. THERE WAS NO OFFER OF ANY RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM AND I WENT AWAY HUNGRY AND QUITE DISAPPOINTED  IN THE LIES I WAS TOLD ON THE PHONE REGARDING THE WHOLE SITUATION EACH TIME I CALLED THAT EVENING.
IT WAS QUITE A WHILE UNTIL I ORDERED AGAIN FROM THEM WITH THE ONLY RESOLUTION WAS FROM MYSELF TO JUST NEVER GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY AGAIN..SO I DONT DO DELIVERY. I GO PICK IT UP MYSELF FROM THAT POINT IN TIME UNTIL THIS LATEST INCIDENT;---
I ORDERED MY USUAL AND AGREED TO CARRY OUT.  I ASKED HOW LONG TILL MY ORDER WOULD BE READY...
I GOT THERE  AND PAID FOR MY PIZZA AND WENT DIRECTLY HOME TO EAT. I LIVE ABOUT 6 BLOCKS UP THE AVENUE FROM THE STORE.
WHEN I GOT HOME AND WENT TO SERVE IT UP..IT LOOKED LIKE THE PIZZA WAS VERY OLD. BARELY WARM. IT WAS HORRIBLE AND I CALLED IMMEDIATELY TO TELL THEM ABOUT IT.
I WAS TRANSFERED TO ANOTHER WORKER ON THE PHONE AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD COMP ME THE SAME PIZZA NEXT TIME WHEN I ORDERED.   FAIR ENOUGH I THOUGHT.. WELL APPARENTLY THEY DIDNT ENTER THE CREDIT/COMPED RESOLUTION IN THE COMPUTER THEY I.D. YOU ON WHEN YOU CALL THEM A N ORDER BY PHONE.  NO NOTATION WAS PUT INTO THE COMPUTER BY WHOEVER I SPOKE TO
AND AGAIN NO RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM AND NO RESPONSIBILITY TAKEN OR HONESTY OR INTEGRITY TO WITHHOLD THEIR WORD THAT WAS MADE TO ME TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.
TREATED LIKE A DERELICT TRYING TO SCAM THEM FOR A FREEBIE.
NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS NOT REAL HAPPY TO SAY THE LEAST.
AND I WILL LET THESE EXPERIENCES IVE HAD WITH DOMINOES BE KNOWN ANY AND EVERY TIME I GET AN OPPORTUNITY- BEIT SOCIAL MEDIA. YELP. BBB. GOOGLE REVIEWS AND ANY WHERE ELSE UNLESS THEY HOLD UP TO THEIR WORD AND THEIR FIX TO THIS PROBLEM THEY MADE WITH ME ON THE PHONE.

The pizza was okay. The cheese bread was hot and good, but to charge 8 bucks for a wanna be garden salad is pathetic. It speaks to greed!!!< /review>

Ordered through the app. Took money from my card but demanded payment upon delivery! The delivery person could have asked to see my bank account for proof of deduction or the manager- who left me on hold forever- could have asked for the confirmation number. I wasn’t about to pay twice. After reviewing Yelp reviews, I guess it if for the best. I noticed that it went from “in the oven” to “out for delivery” really quick. Apparently, they routinely undercook their pizzas so we dodged a bullet. Delivery was 50min and it was marked as delivered 20min before it arrived. Shady & unprofessional. We will not attempt another order. Now to dispute with my bank...<//Review>

I  generally get in my car go online with my phone leisurely order my pizza pay for it then I drive there about 10 minutes away and it's ready when I get there they also have a deal where after getting six pizzas you can get one free. If you add on more items to on the coupon I think a little pricey but it's a good pizza I definitely recommend them< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I placed an order and redeemed a free pizza. I called to add a tip to the order and the woman who answered was awful and would not add a tip. So I cancelled and lost lost my free pizza. 2nd time this has happened. Don't try to alter after redeemed or loose it. I'm not order from the Avenue area again. Ghetto<//review>

So ive been ordering from them for a while. At first everything was delivered on time orders correct. The past 3 times I've ordered, they take over an hour to deliver and have gotten my entire order wrong. Today, its was exactly 1 hour and 30 minutes for the delivery guy to get here, my entire order was cold and all o got offered was a credit for a 1 free pizza! FYI, I live not even 5 minutes away from there. Only reason I pay for delivery os because we are usually busy. So yes, I'm very disappointed and will most likely never offer from here again. Sorry Jeff (delivery guy) that your coworker didn't show up but you guys still messed up badly here. Everything was film cold.</review>

Horrible. Ordered a pizza for delivery. Did not show up even though tracker said it was delivered already. Went to call store and lo and behold no answer. Called 4-5 times still now answer. Do yourself a favor, screw Dominos get yourself a digiorno.< /Text>

Just wanted a basic pepperoni pizza, too complicated to order on line. Person who answered the phone had to check if they would deliver to my address, put me on hold, and never came back. Called back and was told it would take an hour to get pizza. HELLO, it's Saturday, is the management of this location too stupid to have enough staff?<//text>

A woman who told me her name was ROBIN answered the phone. i asked her the price of their honolulu hawiian pizza & thier price for breadsticks...she told me. then i asked if they have any specials... she rudly responded  "are you placing an order or just asking about prices, maybe you should call back when youve decided what you want" .... i was like woah sorry im on a budget!! thats rude! i think ill call pizza hut!</review>

08/17/2018 my order was incorrect... I didn't order cheese bread, but ordered the spinach and  fetti cheese bread, but got cheese bread.  also all four lava cakes in one box squished together in the corner of the box with the middle of cakes collapsed.  very disappointed< /review>

Walked in it took them 10min to make me an offer and took another 10min to do the paper work. Amazing costumer service 10/10 Thank you future auto.</review>

If I could give 0 star, I would. I experienced a very poor customer service with an agent here. I was walking in to this branch and spoke with an agent. I was asking if they have some great deals for a premium brand that is within my price range. But he said that they don’t have that much. He showed me 3 cars that are right next to each other. It felt a lil bit frustrating already the way he entertains a customer that’s why I decided not to spend anymore time with him. My frustrations even got worse when I went home, browse their website and found so many great deals of the brands that I was looking for and that is within my price range.</review>

<Text>Just leased my 3rd car from Future Auto Sales, and I couldn't be any happier with my purchase. I went in unsure of what car I wanted for my next car, and David was very helpful in showing me cars in my budget and was very knowledgeable in the field. He showed me a few cars and was very patient throughout the entire process. The rest of the staff was very welcoming and friendly as well. Overall, I LOVE my new car, the color, and the way I was treated at Future Auto Sales.

Thank you to everyone at Future Auto Sales!</Text>< Rate>

<Review>Purchased a 2016 Fiat 500X from FAS and I’m delighted with the car and the whole buying experience. Matthew answered my first call to the dealership and was the most well-mannered and helpful Salesperson I had spoken to while enquiring about cars at various local dealers. We scheduled a test-drive and Matthew welcomed my husband and I at the lot, he was polite, knowledgeable and not-at-all pushy. To finalize the purchase we dealt with another Sales Manager and Financial Officer who were both very friendly and efficient. We were told we could bring the car to the FAS Burbank service center if there were any issues (30-day warranty). After 2 weeks I had noticed the brakes were squeaky so I took the car to the shop in Burbank and they cleaned the break pads and serviced the car free of charge. Again, the guys were super-friendly and efficient. Thank you FAS! The car’s going great and I paid a fair price with total peace of mind = one very happy customer :)<//Review></record>

From the moment I started communicating with this Dealership, they displayed the highest level of honesty, integrity, communication, and efficiency. This was my first car purchase on my own (BMW M3), and they made the entire experience a pleasure and easy. I must also mention that the car I bought is in excellent shape and better than described and anticipated. I will be coming back in the future and telling my friends and family about this dealership.</text>

Excellent people and honest to talk with.   Was looking at a Porsche for a friend out of state who wanted a particular model and color.  The whole group at FAS were very friendly and accommodating while going through the car for a couple hours.   The Porsche was what they advertised and a beautiful car.  Daniel was very helpful as well as the whole group there.  I looked at other cars while there and would buy from this group</Review>

I sold my car to Future Auto Sales in March. Daniel reached out via email at the first place. After I read their Yelp reviews and Google reviews, I decided to give it a shot. My plan was to just get a quote/appraisal. However, Daniel was able to provide an offer that I just can't refuse. It's the best offer among the 5, 6 dealers I checked including the one from CarMax. After I made my mind to sell it, Daniel was able to take care of everything for me including completing all paperwork, contacting my bank for car loan payoff, etc. I've only spent merely 2 hours in the store, it includes the time for the appraisal + car sales paperwork, and I walked out with a check and a happy face. I am very satisfied with the offer and their frustration-free services. Highly recommended! Talk to Daniel for car sales!</Text>

<text>They actually purchased my CRV at a higher price than what CARMAX was offering and the transaction was made pretty fast. Honda got the payment in less than a week. I will definitely sell my other cars to them in the future.They also have super expensive cars on the lot. It's small but pretty great working with them.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0dfc9fee7d7:0xba8b55fccf6c1b65<//Gmap_id>< pictures>

Bought a hybrid vehicle... I asked why is the engine so noisy..they said it's normal and it shuts off and goes to hybrid on its own.... Turns out the noise was something else...engine blew a whole 4 months after I had drove off the lot...and i paid in full so was screwed out of $8,999 thanks guys<//Text>

<text>Great experience buying a car. The dealers were low-pressure and made the entire buying process very easy.  Additionally they went above and beyond and found me an insurance rate that was far lower than anything I was able to find myself. If you tell them your budget and ideals when buying the car they will do whatever is reasonably within their power to make the deal happen within that budget.  Especially given that it's a car dealership, they run an honest business.  I would recommend buying from them.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rate>

First class service. The sales person Jassy went above and beyond. He provided us with exceptional service. Paperwork was done in few minutes. We are extremely happy with our vehicles and had very positive experience at the dealership! I highly recommend this dealership! Looking forward to get more cars from Future Auto Sales.<//Review>

How to start our experience my wife and I we felt like this dealership treated us with lots of respect and patience eventhough I was given the associate a little bit of hard time about the price he kept his composure and professionalism so we just like to give him our thanks for everything he did.</text>

Bought a Lexus from this place from out of state, great deal on the car nice people even grabbed me from the airport. Only reason for 4 stars is the map sd card was missing and I didn’t notice before the sale was done and they weren’t able to take care of it for me.</Text>

<review>Very nice experience for selling a car! It was my first time selling a car and the staff here were very nice and professional enough to make sure everything is taken care of. The process was smooth and fast. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you sell your car here. They offered VERY REASONABLE PRICE, which was way more than the carmax appraisal. I would recommend go talking to SYDNEY and her supervisor, ARTHUR. They were the best and they made sure I am satisfied with their service. Thank you Sydney and Arthur for such a nice and convenient car selling experience :)</review><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>104158297799596356995</userid>< Gmap_id>

Couldn't be any happier with my vehicle from Future Auto Sales. I leased a car from them almost 3 years ago now, and they helped me get into the exact car & trim I wanted. I'm starting to look for my next car with them and they've already been beyond helpful with information.

Excellent service, fantastic prices. Looking forward to my next car!
Thank you, Future Auto Sales!</Text>

I was helped by Sydney, who took me for a test drive in the car, and once I was satisfied with the car she worked with me and Arthur (the owner) to come to a deal on both the purchase and the trade-in.

Arthur gave me a great price on my old Cayman, and through some negotiation, we came to a good price on the new car.
While I already had my financing ready to go, Arthur asked to see if they could match the rate I had through my Credit Union. I was fine with this.
They were able to match the exact rate, so everyone wins!

All in all a very positive experience and would recommend buying a car with FAS to anyone. Sydney, Arthur, thank you!</text>< Pictures>

We had Best experience to sell our old car and buy another car from FAS.
David and other guys are very knowledgeable and helpful. They don't push you to buy a car. They explain details about the car you are looking at.
Definitely check with them before you purchase a new or used car.< /review>

I went back to CarMax to get my car appraised again but this time they only wanted to give me 20k. Luckily I wasn’t in a hurry to sell my car so I’m didn’t accept that offer. I went to Kelley blue book to get a quote “just for fun” bc  I didn’t think they would offer me more than CarMax but I wanted to get a second opinion before I gave up in selling my car. I thought that I was selling my car to Kelley blue book and once I got an email to get it appraised at a location affiliated with them I just thought they would Just inspect it and send pictures to Kelley blue book. Ha! I called and spoke to Daniel and  made an appointment for the same day. My husband was not a happy off going somewhere else because he thought it was a waste of time because they wouldn’t give us a range of what the offer would be over the phone. I personally didn’t see an issue I understand that they need to inspect the vehicle, but my husband didn’t see it that way. So I made him go with me and luckily it paid off they inspected my car and after some negotiation they offered me more than CarMax. I went in on a Saturday and we did the paperwork and left my car there that day today is Wednesday and I checked my car loan and It has been paid off !!! Wohoo!<//text>< Pics>

< review>
I recently had the pleasure of purchase a 2010 Honda Insight Hybrid from FUTURE AUTO SALES.  From the moment I walked onto the lot the sales personnel were helpful, personable and willing to answer all my questions.  They told me the particulars of the vehicle and the price was absolutely spot on for my budget.  The vehicle though a few years old is in great condition and care had been put into it by the previous owner and FUTURE AUTO SALES made sure everything was right.  Jesse Rubio and the entire staff were there to answer any question and calm any concern.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat and have recommended and will recommend FAS to my friends.  Too bad I don't need another car 'cause this is where I would go first.</review>

<Review>I called and asked them to help me out and I submitted my application. I called the next day and asked if they’ve seen it and said it was pending, guy on the phone said he’ll let me know by the end of the day. It’s been 3 days since then. I guess they don’t care about customers who are interested in buying a car, even though they said they wanted to help me out.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I really love my car but so sad I have to let it go. I went to some dealership but ended up Future Auto Sales. They offer higher prices in the area for the quality pre-owned car. Emin is really really helpful, detailed and nice. He did help me go through the whole process and documentation. It's a very reliable auto dealership. I really recommend Future Auto Sales for people who considers vehicle sold.</Review>

<Review>VERY PLEASANT EXPERIENCE!!!  My salesman was John... He was very polite and knowledgeable. I didn't feel pressured into buying a car.. All the cars are low miles and very nice... Finance person Jesse was very nice also.. I drove away in a VERY nice car with a low monthly payment.. They met all my needs I told them exactly how much I wanted to put down payment and monthly payment and they got me lower than what I expected... Thank you Future Auto will come again to get another car!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I have never had a worse experience buying a car. We were offered a deal on a truck and accepted. We completely rearranged our work schedules to pick up the truck as well as made plans to sell our other car. They contacted my husband the morning of, VERY last minute, to tell us the price went up almost $2,000 which is unacceptable for truck was under 10k to begin with. Extremely disappointing in this experience and will make sure to tell friends not to come here.</review>

<text>I give Future Auto Sales in Glendale 5 Star because they helped me get the car I wanted even though I had bad credit. I didn't feel pressured to purchase anything other than the beautiful Lexus IS 250 that I got. Amin and Jesse were both awesome abd I would recommend Future Auto to any of my friends or family!! Thank you Future Auto Sales!!<//text>< pics>

Future Auto Sales is a really good dealer with awesome selection of cars. I bought my Lexus from here almost a year ago, to this very day I've had no issues with the car. My sales person was Alex and he's truly a classy guy who went out of his way to make sure I was satisfied with the purchase. Financing was a snap as well and everything was wrapped up very quickly. I traded my car and drove off the lot with my new car within hours. Thank you to everyone @ future auto sales for such a smooth transaction.< /review>

<Review>Really honest dealer. I took my car for a pre-purchase inspection and they confirmed me all what I had heard. There were a couple of minor points that I discovered after the inspection and a couple of medium ones (a dent and a possible issue with the alternator that could come up in few months), but nothing serious. Nothing unexpected for a pre-owned car (in my case a BMW convertible with hard top). I was given all the information  I needed (technical, financial). They helped me with tinting the windows, taking the car to a car shop for an inspection, etc ... All the agents are great, but, Carlos Gomez, in particular was outstanding. If I had to buy another car, I would first call them. I took business cards with me for my friends and colleagues. They also have a car shop in Burbank with great deals for the customers. Ah, and the deal was really fair and good. If I don't come back in few months, this purchase was a total success.</Review><username>Sergi Rafhil<//username>< rating>

<review>I had a bad experience trying to sell a car here. John on the phone told me that they could get close to the $4k price I wanted for my truck if it was in the condition I listed. Initially via email he had said the range was $2-4k. I had not mentioned some minor scratching/denting on one side. On arriving he had me wait "5-10 minutes" while Kelly blue book ran the info (I thought KBB was instant), and then offered $1500. Then I went through 4-5 more rounds of things that all took 5-10 minutes, different people looking at the car or 'making calls' (all took about 12 minutes) then when I rejected the $1500, they said 'let's see what the manager can do'. Manager never talked to me, but John came back and said now they can do $2k, so I walked out. Seemed like an algorithmic rehearsed set of sales tactics to try to take advantage of someone in a pinch needing to sell their car. John tried connecting with me at the end and he has a very nice set of interests, but I still felt like my time was wasted and I was communicated with in-genuinely during the whole process.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c0dfc9fee7d7:0xba8b55fccf6c1b65< /gmap_id></record>

<text>This review is of the car and customer service
summery: they are a bunch of sleezy salesman trying to make a quick buck and will lie and manipulate you. Bought the car they said there mechanics did some basic things like a look over and oil change. They didnt once I fixed the fuses the next day I had a engine check light. Im gonna have to spend more money then what I bought the car for.
DO NOT GO HERE THERE TERRIBLE.

Car
Bought a used car from them about 3 months ago. In those 3 months I drove less then 1,000 miles and probably spent 1,200 bucks fixing it out and now it looks like the engine just blew out for no reason I drove the car calmly knowing it was a used car and already had problems. I need to replace the soft top roof because there is a hole in it which I only noticed couple days later when it rained. The best part it was missing almost every single fuse and needed an oil change. So not only do I have to pay 7,000 to get it in drive-able condition they didn't even do what they said they did like an oil change and a basic inspection and fix like fuses. Everything that had to be fixed in 3 months or less is Clutch, slave and master cylinder, fuses, belt and belt tensioner, MAF sensor, Intake hose, timing chain, valve tick (new engine), every single plastic screw for the plastics were missing (idk how i missed that when I was buying it), roof replaced, all the seals replaced, toyota and mr2 emblems, headlights and interior lights. To be honest that is probably more then  7 grand.

The customer service.
Talk about buttering people up. "this car was waiting for someone like you" "this is prefect for you" "you're really getting a great deal"( i got ripped off) and i can keep going. Better yet he kept saying how he does anything and everything to get away from the law while driving and sucks up to people if he has to, just so he doesn't look bad or gets in trouble.</text>< user_name>

I just bought a new Alfa Romeo and needed another new car like a hole in the head.  My buddy just bought a Porsche 991 Carrera, and I had a very nice 997 which is the earlier model.  His purchase got my head reeling and I started looking. I saw this incredible 2015 dark blue GTS cabriolet at Future Auto Sales.

Truth be told I'm not too keen on any independent car dealerships in Los Angeles, and I was ready for some type of flim-flam or BS.  Call me skeptical.  Call me cantankerous.  But Arthur the owner was fabulous as were the salespeople including David.  I got a terrific trade in on my Porsche.  Normally I would never trade in my car, but they gave me a great price on the purchase and on the trade in.

They are even refinishing the lower skirt on the Porsche.  It wasn't a cheap purchase at over $100K and I want it to be perfect.

Great people.  As always YMMV.  My experience was super!

EDIT: I was in touch with Arthur shortly after I traded in my 2007 Porsche, and learned that it had a $1500 problem that COULD have been covered under my extended warranty had  I known about it. I felt horrible. The upshot is most dealers may have just sold the car with the problem as it was not easily detectable.  They did not.  I got more honesty and goodwill from these guys than I have from the two Porsche dealers I have done business with.<//text>

I would love to thank ALEX from future auto sales. Honestly he is one of the best cars sales men i have ever met.Considering i just bought a car September 2012, from a different dealer. Alex is really outgoing and ofcorse a gentleman. I would really recommend him to anyone buying a car from this dealership!. He helped my boyfriend and I on buying our first car. Ford Ranger 2001.My boyfriend is a first time buyer and Alex really worked with us answered all of the questions I had about the truck, contract, and payments. He also had the truck ready for us both to test drive. this dealer ship is a friendly environment. alex makes you feel like family and makes sure that you and 100% comfortable with the down payment and monthly payments before signing any paperwork.Over all my boyfriend and i are 100% satisfied with the outcome of Future Auto Sales.(:</Text>

Checked the car out from top to bottom, inside and out and it was in amazing condition, test drove it and wasn't dissappointed.

<Text>Worse Car Ever.

My Daughter and I purchased a car from Future Auto Sales 5 months ago. She spent 2 years riding the bus to college and working really hard to save for a car. She was able to save enough money to purchase a nice car with 40k miles from FAS in cash.

Well, the car has spent more time in the shop than on the road.  20 minutes after driving the car off the lot the transmission malfunction. They were nice enough to pick up the car and repair/replace the transmission at no cost.  3K miles later, the transmission malfunction again.  After the transmission was inspected by the adjuster from the warranty company and my own mechanic, they found RUST inside the new used transmission provided by FAS.
A rusty transmission was installed on the car.

Please insist on purchasing the Contract Cancellation Option Agreement. The extra 250.00 could save you some headaches.
Per the Finance Manager, "The dealership could not provide this option" therefore I had to sign under the Declined section of the contract.

Don't let this happen to you.  GO TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP.

I ignored the bad reviews at first because they were so nice. NEVER AGAIN.<//Text><UserId.>105575622924289375985<//UserId.><username>Randal Anderson Chandler< /username><date>1404254261733< /date>< Response>

Nice enough people, mis-labeled a four as a five and would not even try to price match when shown comparables. Will update should anything change.<//Review>

<Review>Future Auto Sales...where do I begin? Let's start with customer service. Absolutely HORRIBLE. If you purchase a vehicle from this dealership DO NOT DEAL WITH VIC. He's nice at first but then after he starts talking and takes your money is VERY arrogant and ignorant, obviously having no customer service-related skills. I just purchased a 2005 Mercedes C230 Kompressor from this place and there were some things that needed fixed on it so he told us to come back in a week. So my husband called the day before we were coming to get it to make sure it was ready. Vic told us to come on down the next day, so we did. We drove the 3 hours from Ridgecrest only to find out the car was not ready. The manager told us he would bring it to the town next to ours either Monday or Tuesday. I called Monday and I get transferred to Vic. I ask him if my car is coming that day and he starts saying how he never told my husband the car was ready. Why the hell would we drive 6 hours for nothing? And I didn't even ask him that, I just wanted to know if my car was being delivered. So I got transferred to the manager and he said it's probably coming tomorrow. So I call the next day and guess who answers the phone again? Vic. I ask again if my car is coming today as they told me it was, and he tells me he won't say anything. It's been a week and a half, they have my check and I still have no car. Again, if you do decide to purchase a vehicle from this place, AVOID VIC and make sure your car is in good condition before you leave the lot. On a side note, the manager was the only helpful person in this horrible experience.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Future Auto Sales, you guys are the best!

Was shopping around for a Mercedes, shopped around to 5 of the major dealerships in Southern California, then came across Future Auto Sales.  They beat all of the dealers pricing hands down.  Not only did they beat their price, they got me a fully loaded one for cheaper then the other dealers quoted me.

The service was incredible.  I put the sales guy through a lot, asking for specific features and options, add-ons, color changes, and so on.  Sales reps name was Alex and he was very professional through out the entire process.  Incredible customer service!  Thank you Alex and Future Auto Sales.  I am soo happy with my Mercedes.

I got a bunch of referrals coming your way now..lol.<//Text>< Pics>

I like to tell you about my experience with Future Auto Sales.I met Alex Vini at Future Auto Sales through my niece's boyfriend and let me tell you, Alex and Future Auto Sales will do anything to make you happy.Alex was the most friendly person I have met in years, very patient and was constantly calling people and finding information for me about the truck I wanted.  Future Auto Sales found me a brand new Toyota Tacoma 2012 and had it delivered the same day and it was raining too!  Future Auto Sales also has access to car insurance right there at their facility and got my insured as well!  Look people, because they are a dealer, they can get you the best deal, the right car for the right price.  They are honest and followed through, I had Alex calling me 1 week after I bought my truck to find out how I was doing and how was everything with me and my new truck.I really made new friends at Future Auto Sales, I not only recommend that you visit them, give Alex a call or call Future Auto Sales today and ask for Alex and you won't regret it, he will get the car you want for less and you will be so satisfied, you'll be tanking me, lol.I'm bying my next car at Future Auto Sales!< /text>

I got an email from this dealer immediately after my quote and a call later that day to bring my car in. Marlene was super friendly and made me an appointment for that night and to call back if I couldn't make it. She told me to look for David when I get there.

This lot was full of beautiful cars which surprised me because I thought used car lots would have junky cars. Anyway, David and I took the car around the block, went back to his desk, he asked if I needed a drink then he gave me the KBB value of $1k and showed that to me on his monitor. I didn't want to sell my 2005 Camry XLE for less than $3k. He bumped it up to $1.7k but I still rejected his offer so he had Arthur come to talk to me.

Arthur said it was going to cost him about $2.5k to fix up the roof paint and both of the bumpers. He was very honest because I had checked around on the repair. I was still adamant on $3k so he offered me $2k. I countered offered $2.5k but he refused to budge and told me to sign off my pink slip for $2k. I told me ok if he ubers me home. I switched the topic of selling my car to buying a new used one. He said that he will give me a better deal then the car dealers and that he will show me the invoice and his mark-up so I said where do I sign. He handed me off to Jesse to complete the paper work.

Jesse was very nice, patiently filled out the documents and told me where to sign on the pink slip. I had to go clean out my car of personal items and he came out to hand me the check. There was another salesman that was talking to me while I cleaned out my car and asked if I needed something to put all my stuff in. He came out with a huge box that was perfect!

Arthur came to talk to me and made sure I didn't take the car seats. He's a very funny and friendly guy which makes all the difference in repeat customers. He asked for my address and ubered me home. I went in there at 7pm and got out at 8:45pm. It was a very pleasant and positive transaction from start to finish. They have a customer for life and I'm definitely going to spread my word of mouth. I highly recommended place for it's excellent customer service.< /Text>< pictures>

<Date>1433943987935<//Date><Text>I cannot say enough good things about Future Auto Sales, both Harry my saleman and Jesse Rubios were a huge help in my car buying process from start to finish. I am from Rhode Island and yet they made it so easy I felt as I was getting the car from a local dealer down the road. They took my car to a local Ford Dealer on my request where I had a full inspection done and Ford told me the car was perfect. It means alot when a dealer goes the extra mile for you. Paperwork was well handled and anytime I felt a concern they put my mind as ease and helped with anything I needed. If you are local these are the guys to see and if you out of state you can rest easy in knowing you are buying exactly what they show you and they make what can be a complicated process a breeze!

Thank you to Harry, Jesse and FAS, I love my car and thank you guys for everything!<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< resp>

This place is amazing. I've been coming here since they opened and it's only gotten better with time. The kimchi fried rice and the honey brick toast are 5/5.

I would say however that the dan dan noodle could maybe be a little better. It was good, but I wouldn't really call it dan dan noodle.

Otherwise everything here is excellent.< /Text>

It's a cute pan Asian cafe.  The waitress can't understand you most of the time and you find yourself yelling your order (pointing didn't work as when you pointed she'd pick a completely different item).  Sesame noodles was pretty bland and the musubi didn't taste like musubi??? Its texture was dry and the rice was not delicious.  Decor is cute and pleasant. Cozy place and fills up quickly.< /Text>

< Review>
FOOD:  Premium Spicy Miso with Pork and Egg, Spam Musubi (munchies)
Once you get over the delicious aroma and the immaculate presentation, slurp up the goodness of the spicy miso!  The Miso is SPICY, which is fantastic if you can handle it.  Gosh, that Miso broth is to die for.  I felt tempted to take my remaining broth home to pour over my instant noodle packets for the next day.  Seriously, that good of Miso!  The noodles are just the right size, not too thick or thin and the pork was masterfully seasoned.  They add a soft boiled egg, which was not necessary and didn't add much to the already tasty dish.  If you've got the munchies, order the Spam Musubi.  They are the daintiest version of spam musubi I've tried, looking like a fancy hors d'oeuvre, but yummy nonetheless.

DESSERT:  Chibi toast
I had seen the beautiful pictures, but wasn't sure of the actual taste.  Literally tastes like deep fried, buttered french toast.  The toast comes with an assortment of fresh fruit (mango, strawberries, and kiwi) as well as matcha ice cream and whipped cream.  The dessert takes 20 minutes to prepare, so if you're interested, order with your entrees.  It is very different and I appreciate a change from creme brûlée or other generic desserts.

DRINKS:  Crystal Blue Lemonade and Honeydew Milk Tea
Both drinks are well made and served in cute mason jars.  If you're avoiding dairy, try the lemonade which is highly refreshing.  For my dairy drinkers, you can choose your milk tea with whole, regular, or silk milk and the honeydew is a nice touch.

ATMOSPHERE:  5 Stars
No sooner than we entered the restaurant, we were warmly greeted right away and got to choose any table.  The restaurant uses its limited space very wisely with a bench seat running against the wall and a long counter.  There are several tables in the middle and cute decorations.  Korean music videos in the background will keep you entertained while you wait for the food.

Yes, it's true, Hollywood offers a great deal of highly rated restaurants, but this place definitely is a serious contender!</Review>

Really filling. I ordered the small combo of 6 wings and 3 drumsticks soy garlic. And 2 spicy. And they were spicy . It also came with some cold slaw which balanced the flavors perfectly. Highly recommend if you are craving some good Korean fried chicken and have some splurge money to spend. The price is not so bad because of how much you get. All this for $14.95!<//Text>

<review>Delicious ramen shop! I've always gotten the spicy vegan miso and it's always been excellent! Just a warning, if you're going with a group they'll only split onto 2 cards per table so plan ahead.< /review>< UserId.>

<text>Great Green Curry and Coconut Rice! I ordered through Yelp Eat24 and my order got here in less than an hour. Food was warm and delicious and I had left overs. Prices are almost unbeatable for delivery. I've found my go-to Thai delivery spot. I would recommend this Joom!< /text>< rate>

They have great ramen. I ate the shoyu ramen and had honeydew melon milk tea with boba which is amazing. They offer different kinds of milk in case you are lactose intolerent. They also have small food options like pork buns and spicy tuna rolls. There are great desserts like brick toast in a few different flavors and the costumer service was great. Very nice and patient. I would recommend to go for lunch and you can take friends.</Review>

FOOD:  Premium Spicy Miso with Pork and Egg, Spam Musubi (munchies)
Once you get over the delicious aroma and the immaculate presentation, slurp up the goodness of the spicy miso!  The Miso is SPICY, which is fantastic if you can handle it.  Gosh, that Miso broth is to die for.  I felt tempted to take my remaining broth home to pour over my instant noodle packets for the next day.  Seriously, that good of Miso!  The noodles are just the right size, not too thick or thin and the pork was masterfully seasoned.  They add a soft boiled egg, which was not necessary and didn't add much to the already tasty dish.  If you've got the munchies, order the Spam Musubi.  They are the daintiest version of spam musubi I've tried, looking like a fancy hors d'oeuvre, but yummy nonetheless.

DESSERT:  Chibi toast
I had seen the beautiful pictures, but wasn't sure of the actual taste.  Literally tastes like deep fried, buttered french toast.  The toast comes with an assortment of fresh fruit (mango, strawberries, and kiwi) as well as matcha ice cream and whipped cream.  The dessert takes 20 minutes to prepare, so if you're interested, order with your entrees.  It is very different and I appreciate a change from creme brûlée or other generic desserts.

DRINKS:  Crystal Blue Lemonade and Honeydew Milk Tea
Both drinks are well made and served in cute mason jars.  If you're avoiding dairy, try the lemonade which is highly refreshing.  For my dairy drinkers, you can choose your milk tea with whole, regular, or silk milk and the honeydew is a nice touch.

ATMOSPHERE:  5 Stars
No sooner than we entered the restaurant, we were warmly greeted right away and got to choose any table.  The restaurant uses its limited space very wisely with a bench seat running against the wall and a long counter.  There are several tables in the middle and cute decorations.  Korean music videos in the background will keep you entertained while you wait for the food.

Yes, it's true, Hollywood offers a great deal of highly rated restaurants, but this place definitely is a serious contender!<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Ramen is okay, but I prefer the homemade curry with chicken. It isn't overwhelming with curry flavor and not bland at all. The pork buns are delicious. They have boba tea here and there are a handful of options.

Very friendly and quick service. It is a small place, so coming in here with a stroller can't be done, which is a bummer considering it's walking distance from me. Parking lot can be full, but there are is street parking around the area.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Food was super delicious and definitely spicy!I am not very good with spicy but the food was so good, I didn't care.That's even with it toned down. We went in right around four-is so it was very empty. Service was good, but the food was great!Definitely, like everyone else has recommended, order the wings, maybe even two.I had the SO noodles with beef and was good. My Friend had the chicken curry with rice and it was really good too.Next time I'm going to try the curry with noodles. So we'll definitely be coming back.<//review>

Best noodles in the area, the broth is home made & yummy. The staff are all young and very nice. Recommend any noodle dish, the pork bun appetizer is a lovely mix of flavors. I usually get the spicy pork or chicken ramen. Be advised it is spicy!<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Ramen is okay, but I prefer the homemade curry with chicken. It isn't overwhelming with curry flavor and not bland at all. The pork buns are delicious. They have boba tea here and there are a handful of options.

Very friendly and quick service. It is a small place, so coming in here with a stroller can't be done, which is a bummer considering it's walking distance from me. Parking lot can be full, but there are is street parking around the area.< /Review>< resp>

As someone who has extensive experience in eating spicy food, I am 99% sure this place uses chemicals, not spicy peppers, as the source of spiciness.

This is a cool little place. Located in a strip mall, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but is definitely worth a try. The boba is fresh and they give free re-fills on the tea portion. The food was good. I had the chicken kimchi fried rice which was delicious and reasonably priced. Staff was SUPER friendly.<//Review>

The drinks aren't very big so I would probably pass on those next time but the chicken teriyaki bowl was priced right at $6.50.  Wasn't a large bowl and not a small bowl either.

<review>Walked past on are way from an event back to our car, saw how packed the place was and how cheap it was, and took a chance.  What a delectable palate of food. For appetizers we shared the Karaage Fried Chicken and Chashu Siu Mai Dumplings.  For our main I had the BBQ rice bowl and my husband had the Chibiscus.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Ordered the kimchi fried rice and chibi toast. Food was really tasty good flavor. Service was fairly good. Seating area is really small bumping elbows with your neighbor. And they actually stop taking orders before 11pm so be cautious of hours of operation. friendly staff. Chibiscus please expand dining area</Text>

Delicious ramen.  Milk teas aren't overly sweet, great flavors that still let you taste the tea in the background.  Can take a while to make the food, but no wait to sit.<//review>

This is so far the best ramen I have ever had, its so flavorful. I had the chicken tonkotsu ramen and the chicken was so tender and had this great smoky flavor that went very well with the creamy pork broth. Very delicious. Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area!<//Review>

Spicy Miso Ramen is solid. Great mix of veg, amazing slow roasted pork along with the perfect portion of noodles. Cheap hack: $.50 for extra green onions is SO worth it. Share a spam musubi with your buddy and you're golden!< /text>

great ramen for the area

small restaurant

free local delivery

menu is hit or miss with non-ramen options, though 5 stars goes to consistently awesome pork buns and all dessert items including the brick toast is a must try!< /Review>

<text>Prices went way up portions went WAY down!!! I don't usually notice things like that, but damn.

My delivery ramen is 3/4 the amount as it used to be. They don't even fill up the broth in the small container while charging $3 more than they used to.I love Chibiscus. It's my little hole in the wall neighborhood ramen spot. The ramen is of the best in LA (top 3 and I've had it all over) and because it's a little tucked away you can usually get seated right away and the piping hot ramen will come pretty quickly.

Great for vegetarians (seriously they have a veggie bun that was so good my girlfriend had to make sure it wasn't real meat).

My only complaint is that it is pretty small, you'll feel like you're in conversation with the strangers next to you. And there's something about ramen that just doesn't hold well for take out so you're sort of forced to come in, but like I said... it's well worth it!</text>< Pics>

There are a bunch of Ramen joints popping up in this area, and after loving the place across the street until they changed owners, we found this place. IT is the best one, the selection, the richness of the broth, and all the other little bites they offer including bubble milk teas and such. Service is also great. Nom Nom Nom! Couple things to note: it is a small place so i imagine it could get packed at peak times, we always try to avoid that, so we have never had a problem, also, parking may be an issue the lot in from serves quite a few stores and is usually full.</review>

Food is ok. Not the best taste. First time having Ramen here, and I have to say, their peanut noodles is tasteless - I had to get Shoyu broth from my friend's plate to give it some sort of flavor!!! I had their teriyaki chicken appetizer as well; that was very bland also! Their Thai tea was good. Overall, too tiny of a place, their food is not all that, and it's kinda pricey for what you get. Will not be returning.< /Review>

The service was good, the food was delicious (I got almond milk tea with boba and the pork tonkotsu ramen with seaweed), and it was all for less than 20$. Plus they had Asian music videos playing which are always fun to watch. Splitting the bill was really easy and I will definitely be back.</text>

We ordered the following:

- pork bun
-spicy tonkotsu ramen
-spicy miso rame
- milk tea w/boba

Service was good. Fast..

Ramens were spicy n good (so so good) not very Japanese. It is a fusion style ramen.

We felt the pricing is a little high..<//review>

Wow super unimpressed. Over hyped. Restaurant is tiny so with very limited seating. Service was okay.

We ordered tonkatsu Ramen, spam masubi, kimchi fried rice, and a lemonade. My favorite thing we ordered was the lemonade. It was refreshing, light, and a little sweeter than it was bitter. The Ramen was eh OK. There are so many other Ramen places; the Ramen here doesn't even compare. The spam masubi was abysmal. The spam to rice ratio way off in favor of the rice with the rice falling off. The rice was loosely packed making it difficult to eat. The spam was burnt. The size was awkward. The sauce was missing something. The kimchi fried was decent and almost close to one you could get in ktown.

Will I come back....? Hm, maybe... to try the desserts.</text>

This tiny, unassuming, yet cute Asian restaurant offers some pretty unique dishes you might only ever find in a Japanese anime and the vibe positively screams K-Drama, complete with Asian music videos playing on the TV. The menu is modest, but packed with enough flavor and uniqueness that you'd be hard-pressed to find something you don't absolutely want to try at least once.

Being an avid anime lover and Korean Drama watcher myself, (don't tell anyone), there are a few things on the menu I've always wanted to try but have never found anywhere else, such as the famous Japanese OmuRice, which is a soft, fluffy omelet served with fried rice & ketchup. It's... interesting; definitely on the sweet-savory side, and so packed with protein & carbs, this meal practically pays for itself. It's good. Try it.

Their Kimichi Fried Rice is also really popular- It comes with your choice of meat, chicken, or mushrooms, and packs a hell of a lot of flavor from the fermented cabbage. If you love kimichi, this beast is for you.

It being an Asian joint- totally not being racist here- you know the desserts will be taken to the next level. Their Bread Pudding, served with vanilla bean ice cream, just made Yelp's list of best Bread Puddings in LA. It's a meal in & of itself, but definitely worth splurging on the calories. It takes decadence to the next level. Forget the food, and just eat this if you have to. It's worth it.

The rest of what they offer is great, too, but first-timers should really go for the local favorite, and that OmuRice is something else. The ramen- also good. Whatever you choose, it will be oishii! That means "delicious" for you non-anime watchers, out there.</review>

<Text>This is a cute place in Hollywood that offers ramen, Asian snacks, drinks and desserts. :)

AMBIANCE:
Casual. They have about 6-8 tables and a few barstool seats.

SERVICE:
Nice, friendly service.

DRINK:
*Green milk tea - Good! I liked the flavor of the tea. Not the best that I've had but it's nice to be able to complement my ramen with milk tea.

FOOD:
*Spicy Miso Ramen - Tasty! I liked the flavor of the broth. The slices of pork were nicely cut and had a good flavor. The ramen was also done well.

PARKING:
Small parking lot. Yay for free parking! If there's no spaces, they have meters on the street that are free after 6pm.

If I'm ever in the area, I would come back again. :)< /Text>< pics>

Chinensis? Shybiscuits?  Kidiscus?

Chibiscus is an Asian Fusion restaurant that's quaint (code for tiny) with free parking in a small private lot.  In LA?  That's unheard of!

After a fun & exhausting day touring LA, we needed to fuel up our bodies with some nourishment.  A quick phone search later & Chibiscus became our next destination.

I haven't had ramen in awhile, so my order was the Chibiscus Tonkatsu Ramen.
After a short wait, I had my hot bowl of ramen in hand.  Thick, delicious broth with a perfectly cooked egg.  Noodles just the right consistency.  The pork slices were tender & I slurped my soup down to the very last drop.

My friends let me have some of their Kimchi Fried Rice.
A good sized portion with a runny egg on top, the dish was a little salty for me.  This coming from a guy that usually tolerates things on the salty side.  Great flavor, though.

If you're looking for something sweet, various boba teas/smoothies/lemonades are available at your leisure, with some being organic.

Service was good.  Our waters were refilled timely, and we had our food within a reasonable amount of time.  Seating is minimal, with maybe enough for 20 or so.  As previously stated, parking is free if it's available.  Anyone that knows me, knows I hate having to pay for parking.

We all left with happy bellies

Chibiscus, I enjoyed dining at your establishment.  The ramen was on point, with good service and competitive prices.  Matter of fact, all this ramen talk is making me feen for it now.  Slurp!

Highly recommend!

There has been good and bad days. This time is the last time i will be going. I ordered to go and when I got there food wasn't ready! A lady was ordering food when I got there and she got her food before I did!! I had to wait like 20min for my food! when i got home the Tortilla was raw 😠. Very disappointed.Gave 2 stars because the food is usually good.</Text>

Drove 35mins to visit this place because on here AND the sign outside their door said they close at 10pm., we got there at 9:06 and the doors were already locked. So don't know about that 🤷🏻‍♀️<//review>

Called in the order and 10 minutes later it was ready for pick up! Great service and the food, as always, was delicious. The red salsa was on fire tonight! They have a huge selection of tacos and all of them are good.< /review>

Traditional vertical spit pineapple al pastor tacos. Salsa bar. Creamy avocado salsa is good on everything. Come here for tacos and chicken burritos. Anytime I'm in Santa Maria I stop for a taco or 3.< /Text>

Well I must say I really like my tacos at Taqueria Guerrero. I like their salsa bar, and especially the spicy carrots. And they are spicy. The choice is on the menu or extensive, and I may as well have made a trip to Mexico to find such a great variety of wonderful food. I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu. We have been very pleased with this takorea< /Review>

I eat here once in a while. Today I had two shrimp tacos and (my Favorite) two al pastor tacos. As always, chips are gratis, and the salsa bar is outstanding. I always order the tacos here, because they are the most-authentic street tacos I have found in this area. They have it all, including cabeza, lengua, and buche; not to mention the usual asada, al pastor, pollo, and carnitas. Although I almost always order the tacos, they also make a killer burrito. If you love Mexican food, you have to try Taqueria Guerrero.</Review>

The food is fire, a real good go to in sm. I love Mexican food and this place has some the best tacos& burritos. Awesome salsa bar,  music in the background is nice, but the tv is loud and mixes the sound up a bit. Either way give it a try and u will walk out happy.</Review>

One of the best taquerias in Santa Maria. Try a (Guarache de camarón) or tacos de pastor can’t ever go with those here. They’re made on the trompo. (Shepard Style)  The waiters there are not always the best but the food makes up for it that’s why I do a 5 star. They’re sauces are OG prime.< /Review>

Been coming to guerreros for years as a visitor to Santa Maria, always enjoying the variety of food and drinks here. My most recent visit had me order the Al pastor tacos and my guest some lengua tacos. I Must warn that the salsa bar that day had mostly hot habanero spliced into every salsa we sampled including the guacamole. Was disappointed with that, as me & my guest ate less than usual here. The older we get, the less tolerant we've become to spicier food I suppose 😩< /review>

I had a "any kind of meat" huaraches ($13 on the menu) but I was charged $18!) I gave it 4 stars because love the taste of the meat: 1/2 asada (tastes smoky) & 1/2  lengua (flavorful & soft). Too bad the agua frescas aren't real aka homemade from scratch, but from premade syrup</Review>

This place is great. I have had 2 pups treated here.  The first on several occasions, and the second, once, but with an upcoming appointment. I love that they are truly loving toward all animals and treated both of my babies like gold; because that's what they are to me. They prices are reasonable and they won't do something unless it's necessary. The Doc was great. Called me and gave me all of his observations over the phone and was very kind and personable. Love this place. If you're considering taking your pet here, think no more. I approve.< /Review>

Thank you Vanessa for helping me with the appointment! I was so worried about my dog but Kati’s and Morgan really helped me feel at ease. The vet communicated with me about options and took the time to discuss her thoughts. And they helped me keep the cost Low which was extremely helpful during covid. No crazy tests were done<//review>

After some very bad experiences, and being new to the L.A. area, I wasn't sure which vet I could trust with my tiny 10-year-old chihuahua. Last year she ended up needing several extractions, and I really didn't want her to lose any more teeth or undergo anesthesia. It's hard to know which vets are more cost-conscious than caring, and which ones are more eager to pull teeth than to save them. I am so glad I called this Banfield location! Dr. Taylor was professional and thorough while examining my dog, and so kind and patient while explaining that a radiograph given during a dental cleaning would tell us whether the tooth root had periodontal disease, but that my dog didn't have enough plaque buildup to warrant a cleaning (and anesthesia) just yet. I was so impressed (and relieved!) with this attentive care that prioritized my dog's health.
The staff here is also excellent - kind on the phone, communicative and cheerful while you're waiting for your pet, and wonderful with nervous pets. My typically clingy, anxious chihuahua was surprisingly calm when they brought her back to me in a little blue Banfield bandana :) Princess has definitely found her new people!<//Review>

<text>Dr. Michael and the staff at Banfield treated our little kitty Flea. Unfortunately she was diagnosed with FIP which meant she had to be euthanized. The staff was amazing and showed compassion. They even wrote us a beautiful card after telling us how much they loved Flea too<//text>< Pictures>

<review>This location is top notch. Friendly staff, easy check in and out, vets are great!

Been to many Banfield locations across the country during my travels and this one is one of the best.

Parking is super convenient in a supermarket plaza which makes running errands a breeze. Brought my pup in for a few issues and staff were speedy in getting us checked in for an early drop off appointment.

Nice clean lobby area with a beverage station and modest display of items for sale. Noticed the low price for pill pockets and picked those to as an added bonus this trip!

I've had the positive experience of meeting each of their vets and they are all very engaging and highly professional. Took great care of my older pup with a few issues and really made me feel like they did their best to ensure no services were unnecessary. They called me up to us me a few times and ask if I needed anything else looked into. Picked up my girl all happy and tail wagging from a great visit for both of us!

It was a great experience across the board. Highly recommend!< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><name>Kevin Thompson<//name><Response>{'time': 1562198848259, 'text': 'Hi Kevin - Please give your girl an extra belly rub from us!

Great facility. I recommend this one over the one in Glendale because the front staff in Glendale is definitely not as friendly. I feel like this office cares about my dog. The doctor listens to my concerns and the front staff and assistants are caring and compassionate.</Text>

<Text>This is the best pet hospital I have visited. Dr. Louie, Annaliese, and all the staff I have met with have been fabulous. They genuinely care about the pets that come in and know their names. They were kind and willing to work with me in stressful situations. Comforting and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this pet hospital and the accompanying Wellness Plan to anyone and everyone I know.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>My mom’s visiting in town for the week and she’s had problems with her dog’s leg before so she accidentally hurt it again  and my mom (who actively goes to Banfield back home for her puppy) quickly went to this Banfield with an hour left of their “store hours” to see about getting pain medication for her dog. She knows their protocol is to actually see the dog in order to prescribe but considering they have her records bc Banfield has access to all the records of pets at all Banfields and all they had to do was take a look for 5-10 mins and prescribe the medicine, they still decided that they were “booked for the day” and by the time they would be done with their clients they would be closed. This is why people that simply want to work 9-5 jobs and be gone with no commitment to the job should be working in industries like this where they’d simply stay maybe at max 10 mins after to help a dog not be in pain. I go to vets expecting to be served by people that care about pets and want them to be okay, so if I have arrive with an emergency an hour before closing I expect someone to care enough to hang tight and fit my dog in. Never experienced this at any other Banfield so I don’t blame the entire company but the ladies at this location won’t give a damn about your dog if it makes them stay beyond the store hours.</Review><time>1562196937808< /time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2c3ec279d0c4b:0x5fd95a833610af68</Gmap_id>< Rate>

I feel like the vets at the Eagle Rock Banfield actually care about your pet rather than the money you're dropping. Took our dog in for his dental and they ended up having to extract teeth. They could only get the first two before his temperature started dropping and rather than forcing us to make a separate appointment to extract the last tooth and put him through another traumatic experience, they okayed observing it until next year's dental cleaning.  A+ service and care in my book!</review>

These are ruins at the end of a hiking trail and it's not an actual resort. But the place is wonderful and there is a yodeling burn horn. I think if you are a hiker, you will enjoy this. If you're not a hiker, be warned, it's not a quick trip to reach this place.</Text>

The trails are nice and dogs are welcome here. Please be sure to stay well hydrated with water. Good luck.<//review>< Pictures>

Good stuff. 🖼
Street parking only get there early. 🚗
Lots of people on the weekend.👨‍👨‍👧‍👧
There is a place to relax at top of hill. 🛋
The ruins of the hotel can be explored at the top🏨
Get there early before it gets hot out. 🌡🌞
Bring water. 🏺🥛
It is tuff to make it up the hill . 💪🏼
There is really an echo at the top. 🗣
Tail is pretty well maintained for all the traffic it receives. ⛏
Tail is tuff with uneven rocky surfaces and narrow ledges. ⛰
Other hikers are really friendly. 🙋‍♂️🙋🏼‍♀️< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I like it because it is a very well marked path, and it is a good path for people who want to start in this sport, also because it connects with other hikers and makes it more intense, and obviously the views of the sunset.

Me gusta porque es un sendero muy bien marcado, y es un buen sendero para personas que se quieras iniciar en este deporte, también porque conecta con otros sendereros y hacerlo más intenso, y obiamente las vistas a la caida del sol.</Review>

Four me ! It is one of the most beautiful and amazing park.  I grew up two houses from the parks.  Would run and play there with my family.  It's nice to no its still there 💗💗🏞 the water fountain is still there. I lived there 1973- to 1979 the water doesn't taste very good anymore. Or perhaps my taste buds have become more elevated🍾 it was nice to take my little baby dog there. And have her running and playing where I played as a child.</Review>

Incredibly grateful to H&R Block. I'm a small business owner, and I found my way into some issues a number of months ago. They have provided tremendous insight and value, sparking my interest in, and understanding of, government subsidy programs, such as the PPP loan and EIDL loan, during these times. This inspiration led me to initiate the process, with our accountant. They are very good< /review>

The one on Brockton is full of rude people that r more interested in pushing the emerald card as a full time bank card than taking care of clients very very unimpressed and after doing my taxes with them for last 10 years l will not let them near my taxes again. I think their new bank that took over was a bad idea<//Text>

Gerry Mcguire, I love her!  Every year she always knows the most up-to-date laws and gives valuable advice on my finances. I have absolute confidence that my taxes are accurate and that I've been able to utilize any opportunity for the best possible return. Along with that level of professional excellence, I always feel like I'm sitting with family.</Review>

Karen Krueger is an amazing,understanding and compassionate tax care provider. I had a previous tax lady I had with h&r block in san Bernardino sadly she moved to the city of Carlsbad and retired I had a bad experience with a lady 2 years ago at your la Sierra office with a lady named liz and vowed not to go back.. however I chose to give you guys another try this year and am soooo excited that I did.  Cause I truly found a great tax associate in Karen my son is in college and we had many problems due to my husbands employer putting his wrong social .KAREN WORKED SOOOOO HARD BECAUSE MY SON HAD TILL MONDAY TO COMPLETE HIS FASFA FORMS FOR COLLEGE AT UC MERCED... SHE IS ONE OF THE SWEETEST HARD WORKING WOMEN I HAVE EVER MET BESIDES MY OLD TAX LADY WHO RETIRED TO CARLSBAD WHO DID MY TAXES FOR 5 YEARS PREVIOUS. SHE EVEN NOT ONLY FIXED OUR 2017 TAXES BUT OUR 2018 TAXES AS WELL. SHE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A SUPERVISOR/ MANAGER.. WE HAVE ALREADY SET UP A APPT WITH HER AND ONLY HER FOR NEXT YEAR.</Text>

I went in November and the work was guaranteed within a week. I went 4 times by appiontment to sign in papers and every time I went nobody had  even started to process them. Everyone through the job to someone else.It took over a month when somebody eventually took the packet. I paid my fees and guarantees were made by "manager" Chris towards my amend. Now May, I talked to Perla which very rude,unprofessional told me she didnt have the time to talk to me and managers were there but dont have the time either then hung the phone on me. IF YOU CANT KEEP YOUR PROMISES DONT MAKE THEM!! At the end I got NO refunds due to the time delayed for them processing  the papers.< /review>

I bought a dining set on early June 2020 and a week when i got my table delivered it was scraped in the corner and it had drag marks i had to schedule a technician and i was told by customer service i would get my table fixed! Instead of giving me a new product in good condition! Is now September 26th and i still don't have my table fixed and dealing with customer service has been stressful and nothing but a pain! Buying new furniture should be exciting it shouldn't be STRESSFUL im so disappointed at this place.<//review>

Bill was absolutely amazing to work with. My fiancé and I had been looking for a sofa set since we were finalizing a few things to move into a new place. We had our eyes on a sofa that we absolutely loved from the jump. Bill was the first individual to approach us and ask how we were doing, which is a huge plus! He had let us know what specials were going on and to let him know if we had anymore questions. Long story short we decided to finance the sofa even though we didn’t have the exact measurements and honestly wasn’t sure if it would even fit. We finalized our paperwork with the new place and we’re devastated that the sofa we had just purchased was too big. Bill had told us to reach out to him if this was the case and sure enough he made sure to take care of us. As we came back to look at another sofa we were interested in, Bill made sure to have whatever we had put down will be applied to the new sofa and it was absolutely perfect! In the end we love our new sofa and it wouldn’t have been possible without Bill helping us the entire way. He was patient, understanding this was our first home and did not pressure us at all to get something we didn’t want. Bill listened to all of our needs, all of our questions and went above and beyond making sure we got what WE wanted and fit for US. Our delivery was even sooner than the one we had first picked so it was PERFECT!!!

Thank you so much Bill, we appreciate your help and all that you did for us.</Text>

The shopping experience at Ashley’s needs major revamping. I tried calling my local store (Fairfield CA) several times and ended up at a call center after being on hold for 15 minutes, only to be told they are too busy to answer. This happened 7 times calling three separate stores directly.

I drove to the Fairfield store to purchase a small chest, and had to wait 30 minutes for my sales associate to finish with another customer before I could make a simple payment.

I told the sales manager (Jason) it was only one small item and I just needed to hand my credit card to someone to accept payment. I’ll I received in return is “your sale person will be with you shortly”, while at least 4 other associates and office staff were not on the phone or with a customer.

I stated I would buy the item as long as I was able to drive to the warehouse to pick it up the same day. Once they receive your money they forget how to provide customer service, or in this case, continued with the same lack of customer service.

I tried to purchase the item over the phone prior to going to the store and was told by the sales manager I had to come into the store since they don’t place orders over the phone. At that time I advised I needed to pick it up the same day and that I would drive to their warehouse to do so. So this wasn’t a new request I sprung on them when I arrived at the store.

Overall, this was a very poor experience, waste of time, and lack of customer service. I understand why RC Willey’s is opening stores in Northern Californian… even if they provide poor customer service they would still pick up customers Ashley’s is not taking care of.

The only good thing In this experience was the salesperson (Sherrie) was friendly and tried to help where she could.< /Text>

<review>This warehouse is huge with lots of selections! They always have financial options and once in a while offer major discounted sales. We got helped by Divina and she took care of all our needs, from showcasing furniture to ensuring we understood the financial side. We recommend asking for her anytime you visit.

What I liked about Ashley Home Store is no pressure from the sales reps and no one followed you around. We got a great sales rep named Bill Oneal in the Fairfield, CA location who was very knowledgeable and patient as I walked around and kept calling him over with questions. Very happy to have worked with him on my purchases.</Text>

If I could give this review no stars I would but unfortunately it doesn't work that way. I ordered a couch November 30th of 2020. It is now 4 months later and I still have not received the couch. I have been rescheduled 6 different times. I honestly wouldn't mind the rescheduling, I am understanding and know that the shipping containers have been stuck at sea causing delays. However, I have never been told about any of the 6 dates. I only found out by calling the stores to confirm the delivery date. Twice I took days off from work and hired a mover to remove my old couch. I learned my lesson. The sales person who sold me the couch was nice. She had a good personality and was eager to close the sale. The day I bought my couch was the only time I had decent service. 4 months later, I have finally had enough and asked for a refund only to find out a "case would be open" and I would be notified within 3 business days whether I will receive my money back. The only reason I have waited this long is because the specific style of couch I wanted wasn't found in many stores. I don't write bad reviews, if I have a bad experience I don't write one at all. This entire experience has been too much and felt it was my obligation to tell people what I went through.</text>

Sherrie was a professional in every sense of the word. Her knowledge, care, and attention to detail was spectacular. Sherrie help us work through the challenging aspects of our major purchases. Hurray for her pleasant and thoughtful demeanor. Also, Sherrie’s supervisor, Devin was so family oriented and attentive. What a great day at Ashley Homestore!<//review>

It's extremely overpriced for their items that don't even last a year. They want $200 for one lamp that isn't even nice. Hell no. I can buy 6 lamps at ross for that price that are way nicer. The workers also follow you around the store and watch you.. Like I under that they get paid for what they sell but it makes the customers uncomfortable. Also, when you walk in the store they make you check in. They ask you for your first and last name, and your phone number. I should have walked out at that point but I had wanted to go into that store for years. Complete waste of time. Save your time and your money and go to a smaller furniture store. They will give you better furniture for a better reasonable price.<//Text><resp>None</resp><time>1609623284766<//time>< gmapID>

Worst delivery experience ever had. Team leader was rude.
Refuse to assemble dresser mirror upon request. left dresser two feet away from wall. Imagine if an elderly person or single women has to deal with this.
I an 20 years customer will avoid Ashley for my next purchase if possible.</Review>

My experience with Ashley’s has been worse than awful. I have never written a review ever before.  I bought a couch after the thanksgiving weekend on sale. They said it would be delivered in 6 weeks at the beginning of January...my delivery date come and went and they said it would be delayed another month. I immediately canceled my order through Ashley’s furniture customer service. It has been ONE MONTH and I have still not received my refund. I have called about 20 times, I have spoken to more than 6 people who have said they would refund me...still yet no refund. I would NEVER buy anything from this horrible company again. I hope to get my refund soon<//review>

<review>Sales people are nice.  Store is nice.  Everything after you walk out of the store is a nightmare.  Bought a living room suite in August of 2020, after f5 different delivery dates and reschedules, it is almost November and still no furniture.  Our last scheduled delivery date was today, 10/26/2020.  When I called to find out the time window I was informed our delivery was rescheduled for NOVEMBER 9TH.  No call, text, or e-mail from the company.  First delivery date was 10/04, then 10/19, then 10/26, then 11/04, then back to 10/26, now 11/09.  I'll be surprised if I see this furniture before 2021.< /review>< user>

<text>This Ashley is great!! One that makes this store GREAT is Holly, she is the absolute BEST!! She patiently worked with me through my indecisiveness and was very understanding during the process! She made the process very smooth and only offered opinions when I requested. She wasn't pushy and her customer service was top notch! I virtually furnished my entire home and am happy with the furniture Ashley had to offer. Go see Holly if you're ever at that store and I'm sure you'll feel the same way as I do about her! I had a great experience!</text>< GmapID>

<Review>Husband needed new recliner and Ashley was having a wonderful sale. Associate pointed us in the right direction. The second chair my husband tried was perfect. Gina approached us and handled the transaction in a timely manner, still covering everything we needed to know. She explained delivery may be delayed and was willing to show us other options, but we liked the chair so much we ordered two!</Review>< Gmap_id>

Horrible and terrible experience! I waited almost three months for the delivery and my dresser was scratched with the nightstand broken. From the start the sales woman made numerous errors which caused numerous trips back to the store. My delivery date was put off about six times on top of the Fairfield store manager refusing to meet with me to hear or resolve my concerns. Instead I was given a gift card that's not enough to purchase anything in the store. Dysfunctional, not organized, failed to address issues. When you call for anything you experience long wait times to be bounced around to numerous people.In one call you can easily spend 1 and a half hours and speak to four different people with no resolution. Over priced cheap furniture not of good quality. I recommend buying furniture from anywhere else but here. If you take the time to do some research you'll find better quality furniture at a cheaper price somewhere else.<//Review>

They try manipulate people with their offers and insurance policies. Went  to  Fairfield Ashley store to buy sofa set and other accessories for our new home. representative there acted so nice, tried to gave us deals. Took 2 months to deliver furniture. Had a manufacturer defect in both sofa set and coffee table. We went back to store they next after delivery and showed them the pictures. Representative at the desk didn’t took us seriously. Had to a ask for there manager. Manager filed a claim and said that they would fix it once the technician visit to see the furniture. It’s been 15 days no one came. Why would we accept something that’s fixed. When we are paying the full amount for new stuff. Emailed Ashley customer service. Didn’t get any reply either.</review>< gmap_id>

<review>Sales people are nice during the sale time buy never reply to your phone calls and never reply to your text messages.  Everything after that is a nightmare.  Bought one corner couch and they deliver it after 3 months piece by piece. Even I told them I needed the complete set. The delivery guys are worst then the store since they dump the old stuff in your house and when you refuse they just pretend to call the store and run away without any signature. When I visit the store , they are so mean and they don’t want to listen. Always making glad statements “ ok we will deliver in next week or so”.  Manager is so mean and the front desk is a nightmare , because I paid full in cash and they refused to return the money. After all they make false promises to give you compensation for the delay and hassle. They never return your call. ZERO star for them if I could.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5<//gmap_id></record>

Nice furniture but horrible, HORRIBLE customer service!!!!  Ordered electronic recliner & sofa & one did not have the plug in.  Guy dropping off items "called in missing plug in" & said the plug in would be mailed to us.  Called customer service to follow up on this & after being on hold almost 15 min., we were told nothing was ever noted about this.  We were put back on hold, then somehow disconnected.  Had to call back and wait another 15 min before finally speaking to someone.  Explained the situation again, only to be put back on hold.  Been holding for over 30 min. this time!  When we told the customer service rep. that it was hard to hear her, she replied "I don't have time to fix my headset".   Wow!</Review>

Fairfield Ashley has the worst customer service ever. Sometimes they have something cute or a good sale - but once u have to get a hold of someone for assistance with the delivery that gets delayed again and again, good luck-I’m convinced they don’t actually have a phone that takes incoming calls.</Text>

Would have given 5 stars but most of the items that we originally chose ended up being out of stock. It took twice as long to make our purchase for that reason. Other than that the service Bill provided was great.<//Review>

<Date>1602624409660<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>I am extremely disappointment at the professional or lack their of of this company. After moving to California all the way from Georgia to start a new life, I wanted to purchase new furniture; Ashley was the recommended to location. I purchased a mattress, my toddler an entire bedroom set and myself a bedroom set. This purchase was made in early Aug. All my items arrived sporadically. With my bedroom set being the last to deliver; I waited until 29 Sep. Unfortunately, when I was called to confirm delivery I was told that all but ONE piece would be delivered 29 Sep. I had the choice to wait for ALL pieces or receive the pieces that arrived. The last piece (nightstand) was scheduled to arrive at the warehouse 3 Oct (from what I was told). 2 Oct, someone called me from the customer service center to advise me that my nightstand has arrived and wanted to schedule delivery for 13 Oct. I asked if they had an earlier date or location of the warehouse; I would be happy to pick it up (I knew that warehouse was in California). The female stated she would contact the warehouse to check on an earlier date and to see if it was possible for me to pick up my item; she never called me back. Today is 13 Oct and because she never called back I assumed the previous delivery was still standing. No one showed up. I called and called and called and kept getting the run around from previous reps. I was even told that my item is again on back order and is not scheduled until mid Dec. This is unacceptable and certainly NOT what I agreed on during the purchase. I was advised that my all my items would arrive on around 3 Oct. and this is because of a back order. I have spent the entire evening of my time calling the company to figure out whats happening. I was told to call the store (which made no sense at all but OK, I did) but was unable to get anyone on the phone. I am so upset with the way Ashley is handling this situation. This is definitely not good for business. I understand COVID has the shipping industry pretty much in a dead lock but please be transparent with your customers. With that being said, I will be having Ashley come pick up ALL their furniture. I want to give my business and money to a company who has earned it.

As I write this review, I have been on hold with Ashley for 30 mins….. AGAIN!!!!

Prepare yourselves for possibly the worst customer service experience. Furniture was purchased in Jan 2020 and to date they have made 5 trips to my residence to fix their furniture blunders without having fixed it yet. Why?Because their logistics, management and communication are by far the worst I've ever seen in an Ashley. On countless occasions I've tried contacting the store for resolution, but conveniently the call gets re-routed and dropped every time. I have purchased from other stores with flawless execution, delivery and assembly. This store takes your money and forgets about the customer, fails to finish the transaction and compensate you for the hours you took away from work just watch the problems further compound. Some of us don't  have the luxury of taking folk's hard earned money, screwing them over, then turning their backs on them. I hope every active and retired vet in that area reads this and avoids the same headache. Thanks Perry, Henry, and Sherry for not coming through for a retired veteran. You all have proved to be a real class act.<//Text>

Sales rep was awesome, unfortunately the follow up is atrocious. The delivery of my mattress has been a no call no show...twice. I can’t get anyone on the phone. I feel like I’ve been robbed. I just bought a three bedroom house and need everything. I know it won’t be from Ashley. I wish I hadn’t given them my money.<//text>

We got an apartment and I made an appointment to see one of Ashley's associates. When I arrived at the store I was greeted by a friendly smile on one of the employees. Her name is Agnes. She was very informative and that helped me a lot in deciding on my purchases. She also gave me helpful tips on what to check for, once the furniture were delivered and assembled. She has good taste and has an eye for great design. She's able to change how I picture the layout in each rooms without being too persuasive on her own picks. I'm still thinking about the dining set and dresser that she showed me, and how beautiful they would look with our other stuff. I may come back next week to purchase both, as long as Agnes is able to help me.< /Review>

We were immediately greeted as we crossed the threshold of the doors. William was outstanding; he made us feel good about spending money. He was on top of all my needs and totally understood my vision and wants. I loved that he was knowledgeable of all the inventory I was interested in. His customer service was great, he was very informative about the store sales and helped us save over $5,000 all while accommodating our needs also keeping quality in mind. William truly made our shopping experience seamlessly enjoyable.</Text>

Horrible experience! Yes they have beautiful furniture and beautiful displays ! But no costumer service after purchasing product was not delivered on date promised it was hell to get in touch with anyone I had to go down to the Fairfield store to speak to someone about where my delivery went ! Now my furniture has little white bugs coming in and out of the dresser and guess again no one answer the phone no one ! I’ve only had this furniture for a month and I noticed it right away and no one has been able to call me back after leaving messages. I guess I’m going to have to go down there myself.
Also DO NOT buy the 5 year protection plan!! I repeat DO NoT ! It’s basically a 30 day plan because learning the hard way if your item has 2 - 5 accumulated stains it’s no longer under protection!!
Such terrible experience.< /Review>

We ordered a sectional and rug. We love both of them. The three stars due to the customer service. The day of deliver for the sectional they notice that the wedge unit was missing legs. Instead of calling and giving us the option to reschedule they showed up and let us know we can accept it and wait for the legs. The driver had me talk to dispatch and they said someone should be calling me. No call. I had to call the store. No answer could only leave message. Had to call sales person cell where he help out. End up accepting the whole section with no ETA on legs. Legs got delivered four days later.  After the delivery driver left we noticed that we were missing one of the throw pillows. Called store still can't get through. Texted sale person and let him know. He said he would look into it on Tuesday or I can call the store and press 2 to get customer service. Had to call ten times before someone answered.  Three weeks later still no pillow.  Went into store to find out about pillow and because the area rug is starting to come apart. For the rug they said that they couldn't do anything because it was direct ship to us by not the store so no warranty. Completely crazy. Manager finally said he could give me half off new one. Still crazy. Finally manager said they can give me display model in exchange for defective one. If you get you furniture with no issues great. If you have issues good luck with calling customer service.</Text>

They seem busy, but Celeste I think that was her name, had managed to assist me and took my order on the bar chairs. She was very nice. I came back, since 2010, when I last visited this place. The store has so many selections, I love it, it's amazing! Well done!<//review>

It made me not want to stay long in the store.  The music does not need to be Elevator  music but it  should be light and easy and  create a comfortable relaxed atmosphere to  shop .
Also I found the manager very cold and not at all welcoming.  His first question was do you have an appointment.  How about trying..." welcome to  Ashleys and then do you have an appointment etc.<//Review>< Rating>

My Saleslady, Hollie was a real pleasure to work with. There was no pressure to purchase anything. She simply listened to my desire and showed me what Ashley’s had to offer.

However, the 2 delivery employees that brought my merchandise had on “No Face  Masks.” Why would they come into someone’s house after making several deliveries during COVID 19 Upsurge without proper PPE? Ashley’s needs to ensure the same safety measures are upheld in customers’ homes as they do in their stores!<//Text>

Fabulous time at Ashley in Fairfield today! We were warmly greeted by Adrian, who did an excellent job of listening to our needs and finding the perfect pieces for our home. Very knowledgeable and professional. So happy with our purchases and so happy we went to Ashley! Thanks, Adrian!< /Review>

Even though I live 5 minutes from them I will never shop here again. I purchased a dining set from them about 3 weeks ago. When delivered, 3 out of the 6 chairs were wobbly and the table had a small stain. The delivery guy said he would submit a claim for someone to come back and exchange the items. I had to follow up numerous times and finally scheduled for someone to come back. NO ONE SHOWED UP! After getting no call backs I physically show up to speak to the store manager and PERRY THOMAS was awful. He was  completely unprofessional and acted indifferent towards the whole thing. Worst customer service ever. I’m going on week 3 of not having my items replaced or have chairs I can actually use. I will most definitely be following up with corporate.</Text>

We were greeted by Gregg as we walked into the Fairfield, CA the store. He didn’t rush us or try to oversell us.

He was extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of the potential products we considered.  We ended up deciding on a chair and somehow he arranged delivery in 4 days.

Great store,  great salesperson. We will return as long as Gregg is our Ashley Rep.<//text>

The associate Gregg that assisted me was very helpful. He asked a lot of questions to make sure he understood my needs and wants and he was very helpful in answering all of my questions. I was not rushed into making a purchase. He had great patience and offered me many different options to make sure that I was a happy customer when I left the store.</Review>

Bianca spent a good amount of time with me as my husband had already made up his mind on the selection.  The store manager spent time talking with my husband.  Great visit we purchased couch with sleeper and a clock plus extended warranty.</Text><user>108112897020327764642<//user><user_name>Aida Moss</user_name>< GmapID>

Received damaged furniture. The damaged furniture was replaced with different damaged furniture.  That damaged furniture was AGAIN replaced with damaged furniture.  It was a nightmare contacting the store, no return calls.  Poor communication, poor customer service,  amounts to a horrible furniture buying experience.
Please check yelp reviews before visiting this store.< /review>

My husband’s & my experience was fabulous. This was our first time @Ashley’s.
We have been looking around for a mattress & sofa set for a long time.
Our sales rep. (Tiffany) was amazing. She has such a calm demeanor and also the effort of satisfying her customers. She had so much patience & worked with us to make it affordable & also gave us 24 months w/ no interest.
We would highly recommend purchasing from here. Customer service was highly professional. Thank you again.<//Text>

Adrian is awesome! Greeted us from the start with a smile and name. Even though it was his 1st day his professionalism, friendlyness and deminor never waived. He helped us find our dream kitchen table never pressured us on a sale . We look forward to returning to purchase more from him again. He's going to be a great addition to any team. Thank you again<//Review>

Phil came and greeted us and explained all the promotions going on. We came across a bed set and a sofa set. Phil broke down everything for us. Everything from what was included and the price break down of everything. My mother had a ton of questions for Phil and he answered them all. The best part was that he was very patient with us. Never once did we felt rushed or uncomfortable. This was a great clean store and the staff there were awesome. I highly recommend this place and ask for Phil!< /Review><Time>1568598149308<//Time>< user>

Our first time purchasing anything from Ashley’s Furniture store. At first we felt rushed and pressured by the first salesman, Angel. He hovered over us til we felt uncomfortable. Due to this we weren’t going to buy anything until he handed us off to another salesman, Gregg. The 5 stars is solely for the service Gregg provided us with. Gregg was a great, friendly salesman who made us feel comfortable and let us roam at our leisure. We finished the deal with him and would come back to him if we were to purchase anything else. As for their furniture, quality is better  than ikea but they have nothing in stock at this store. Everything must be shipped at your expense or picked up at a distribution center. Good luck.< /text>

My Las Vegas family member shared with me where he purchased his AMAZING COMFORTABLE mattress.
I located a store not far from my home....made appointment and headed out to the store. Once there i waited for Store Rep who was busy wrapping up a sale. That wait was well worth it!🤗
Divina was so warm and friendly as well as knowledgeable about the type of mattress i was looking for.
There was NEVER a feeling of "Pressure Sale" at all with her. She showed me styles of my interest and i "sample lay" in many until i found the one  i was satisfied with and fit my budget. Which was an Ashley Brand Calif King.
Divina was clear in explaining purchase and delivery process.
I'm looking forward to arrival of my new mattress.
Thanks Divina for making my shopping experience with Ashley Furniture a GREAT one!
If you are seeking a place to purchase Home Furniture...i highly recommend Ashley and ask for Divina! 🤗<//review>

In store experience was great. Divina was a pleasure to work with. Delivery is where it all went wrong. We have waited two weeks for delivery today only for the drivers to refuse to take our new couch upstairs. We made it very clear when purchasing that this was going to be placed in our upstairs loft. We were assured it would not be a problem. The delivery driver Jose and his coworker suggested I get power tools, take the legs off and then have a family member carry it upstairs. Mind you I am 3 months pregnant and my husband is away for work. I paid for delivery and assembly yet they just left it in my entry way still in all the wrapping. Very disappointed with this service and plan to follow up with corporate! If they can not resolve soon, I will return the couch. Definitely not the experience I expected!<//text>

<Review>My Associate was "T.C." at the Fairfield location. Upon walking into the showroom we were greeted, and asked if we needed any assistance. Informed T.C. we had purchased a new home a few days ago.  He suggested a few items as we walked around the showroom. After an hour or so we purchased a variety of pieces for our new house. Thank you, T.C. for your time and suggestions .. Happy Customer !!< /Review>< Rating>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Hopefully I can change my thoughts of this store later. I have never been here. My wife and I decided to get a new bed frame and TV stand for our move next week. We found some ncie piedes and they had a good sale going on. The sale was very weird tho. You can use cash or your own credit card and receive 50% off.. Your other option was to open up a credit card with them and receive 30% off. I thought this was weird. Typically you would want someone to open a credit card with you so they spend more money with you in future. It's whatever tho. It's their deal and its not why I gave a 1 star. Literally went in there at 2pm and didn't leave until 4pm..the lady helping us followed us in a circle around the whole store.. When we turned around she would act like she was doing something. When we decided what we wanted it took 1.5 hours to checkout. She automatically assumed we wanted the extended warranty of $299 and shipping of $250. These prices were outrageous.. I went on the website and it offered free shipping. So we did get her to waive shipping on TV stand. During the transaction she walked away from us 3 times for longer than 5 minutes each time without saying anything. Finally my wife went and said something to another sales person. A few minutes later the manager came to help her. She even tried to walk away from him to where he had to tell her to stay here. This is a long story but I cannot believe buying furniture is harder then handling something at the DMV.. When we got home we both somewhat regretted buying what we bought and wish we just bought the bed we saw at crate and barrel. We have great experiences with them and they always give us free shipping out of there walnut creek store. The manager was a funny guy and did make it better and we do like the stuff we bought.. It's on backorder and should be delivered in a month and a half. Next time we go if any of this happens again we are getting our of there asap.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPASGDS0EXSN4rAgert43AOZxdu6j06C_yAkc4A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcIHzeMGdDYcM4YiyQ9xeSf6h7Q3j5s5yiJnyO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5</gmap_id></record>

Dealing with this was excellent .
Dealing with the delivery which still hasn't happened is another issue . No a good experience at all  .
Originally set up for June 17th was postponed on the 15th do to warehouse delivery issue . But still received info still coming on the 17th . Changed to June 21st waited 230 pm to 630 pm no show couldn't track it . No call .
Called next day shifted to the 29th of June.  Went to online chat since my numerous calls went unanswered they could had to go back to the store again they where very helpful.  If not for them I would have dropped my order . Hopefully my chair shows up on the 29th . 28 days after order .< /Review>

<text>Bill O. at the Fairfield, CA location was the very definition of customer service excellence. The words I would use to describe him and my experience are respectful, satisfied, thorough, detailed, attentive, professional, courteous, negotiable, affordable, perfect, exemplary. If he was everywhere and worked in every industry there would never be anymore consumer complaints. The single best shopping experience I have had.<//text>< pics>

Waited more than a month for a sofa delivery and when they showed up this morning it was only half of the sofa. I wasn’t informed about receiving only 1/2 so I refused it and then spent 30 mins on hold only to have a rude customer service rep answer with attitude named Mary. I was transferred back and forth multiple times being placed on hold. Customer care definitely needs some work! I’m extremely disappointed because I’ve heard so many good things about Ashley. Wish I never ordered from here and wasted my time 👎🏼</Review>< Date>

Okay, when I first went there to establish a person that I can rely on and we'll give me honest feedback, I actually found a wonderful lady named Thaina if I spelled that correctly. We bought a beautiful front room set at 40%off before Thanksgiving. Now the thing you have to remember is to answer the text for the delivery & Please call the phone #! Very important!! Can't say that enough because we didn't get our delivery until after</text>

We loved the whole experience. We've bought furniture before but we've never felt this comfortable making a decision on such an important purchase. Jessy was very helpful in helping us choose and decide which sofa we wanted and what to add to it. She didn't try to push additional items, like a typical salesperson would do, to our purchase. Also, she was straightforward when it came to pricing and didn't try to hide any assembling or delivery fees which sped up the buying process! Definitely would recommend to friends and family. Thanks for giving us a homey addition to our new apartment Jessy!<//review>

<Text>My delievery was scheduled for the 15th, I am unable to reach anyone one for customer services. Once i reached a rep. (Tanish) and others they hang up in my face.  I believe this is very unprofessional. I have been calling for 10 business days. Being understnading i have left voicemail in hopes for a call back within 96 hours. No call back, I a have missed work 3 days without pay waiting for my purchase to be delieved.  because the date constantly is being changed.

I am being very understanding however, i also expect understanding to my circumstance...
This is very unfair to customers that, the customer call centers all very RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL.

I asked to speak to a manager, she also hung up in my face by saying she does not have time for this right now!

I truely expected more and i paid a lot of money for my purchase.
I would encourage you not to purchase online.< /Text><name>Monique Williams</name><Response>None<//Response><Time>1590169474329</Time></record>

<text>Pieces of our furniture was delivered broken and some of the art work came straight off of the walls in the store. Once again one piece of art work was damaged and filthy and the service person never told us that some of the art work was coming straight off the stores walls. I fill misled and lied too. I spent close to ten thousand dollars there thinking that I was getting new furniture.  I won't shop there ever again nor will I recommend shopping there to my friends. So disappointed .

We were greeted and given some current specifics about sales etc.  our salesman(Richard) was ready available to answer any questions but never pressured us or made us feel smothered as some can !  We will be going back to visit Richard for any future furniture purchases we make!  We live minutes away from an Ashley location but found it worthwhile to drive the 30 minutes  to the Concord location !  Thank you Ashley and Richard!</Review>

<Text>I had a great experience in the store with the customer service representative’s and the floor representatives, however I did not know that you cannot exchange anything once purchased items have been delivered. I feel that that is a downside of working with this company. In the future, I will definitely have to take that into consideration before making any other large purchases.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

It took nearly 40 minutes to buy a $59 area rug. I have shopped at Ashley in the past and I have had similar experiences. Not as bad as this one though. We bought our first house in 1971. I had fewer papers to sign back then I did today for an area rug that was a floor sample that I knew I couldn’t return. Awful experience. That’s my last visit to Ashley. Too bad I can’t post negative stars.< /review>

Gloria was extremely helpful and professional. It was because of my initial contact with her about a week ago which led me back into the store, instead of purchasing the same couch priced lower at a discount store. Her direct manager was very personable and reasonable as well. She did what she could to work with the numbers to come to a figure I was willing to work with, even though I paid a slightly higher price. The customer service was well worth it. I will definitely return to the store for other furniture items.<//text>

The staff are super helpful, and the store is pretty clean and organized. Some tips for shopping here. Deliveries and returns have always been pretty easy and straight forward.
1. Always do some research first, they will price match to meet competition.
2. Don't pay sticker price, use promotions to get the best deal.
3. Always communicate with the staff, and try to haggle a deal if your on the fence about the purchase.

You should never pay full price, always look for the deals. Hope this helps!< /Text>

<text>Could not have been a better experience from start to finish.  The store is clean and well-maintained, with just a massive selection of furniture.  We were greeted by every staff member we saw, but Derek really went above and beyond our expectations.  He was full of knowledge and willing to run back and forth to the back to research any questions we threw his way.  So very impressed and looking forward to enjoying our new sofa for years to come!< /text>< pictures>

They saw me coming! Much to say but I'm not going to do so because  "LIVE & LEARN", should cover it all. I was lead to believe I purchased an electric piece, received manual. No responses to my concerns. Poor customer care.< /Review>

Watch out for their deceptive sales practices. They tell you they are having a half price sale, when all they're doing is fraudulently inflating the prices so the "sale" price, is actually just the manufacturer's suggested retail price. That is their scam. They also have the worst customer service in the industry,  by far!! Also DO NOT buy their fake leather furniture, the "leather" starts pealing and flaking off within a year.<//text>

I originally came in just to look, but with his knowledge of all the deals, I ended up leaving with a brand new bedroom set that I absolutely love. We decided since we were about to move, we would wait to move it on moving day and he helped with that 100% by holding it for us a couple of days to pick up. When we rung the “congratulations” bell after purchase, the entire team told us “Congratulations!” They also thanked us numerous times and greeted us on the way out. I loved the hospitality, patience, friendliness, and honesty within the store !<//Text>< pics>

Our sales rep Kevin was simply an amazing salesman. No pressure sales he was nice and let us look around and checked on us a few times. Was always available for questions and helped us discover what it was we really wanted. Will definitely look him up next time we are looking for furniture.<//Text>

I love the Ashley HomeStore in Fairfield/Cordelia. I’m a returning customer and both times my experience with their customer service has been an absolute pleasure. They really go above and beyond to make sure you’re happy. Especially the wonderful Miss Bianca C. there. She was so great, very patient and helpful while I spent a very long time choosing a new bedroom set, mattress, and dining room set. She listened to what I was looking for and added her much appreciated expert opinion on the different options. I’m very glad she was there to help me that day, and a couple days later when I went back in with a question. She’s the best!</review>

I sat on it and was disappointed how soft it was... was looking for something firmer. He told me where to look for similar pieces. Like any product, price and quality go hand in hand. I knew I was going over my budget but William gave me the best deal possible and assured me I was buying a quality piece that would last a long time. It was a great experience all around!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Today we went in, always passed by this place commuting. The store is huge inside, everything is scattered all around unlike ikea we were helped by Jessy, and she gave us the most pleasant sales experience. she was patient and gave us space when picking out our couch.

Sales process was very fun, which is rare to see in salespeople! Thank you Jessy and Ashley Furniture!< /Text>

I encountered a wonderful staff an sales atmosphere. I had the opportunity and privilege to be assisted by an awesome sales representative. Her name Bianca Carter. She was extremely courteous and polite. She possessed some incredible customer service skills. She listened tentatively and answered all my questions. In my opinion she should be given more hours and she should be promoted ahead of her peers. And she should be working in customer service. I would highly recommend this store to my co-workers and friends.< /Text>

<username>Anna Reiber<//username><review>Do not believe them if they say you can cancel an order even if it is less then 24 hours, if they take your money you will never get it back even if they say you will!

We placed an order in July and needed it quickly.  We were told we had to buy it and the next day they could determine the delivery date, $700 on my Ashley credit and $150 debit card. If the delivery date was too far out, they would cancel the order and we would get our money back.

WRONG!!  They called the next day with a delivery day too far out, we said cancel the order and they said no problem.  They forgot to mention we would never get our money back and would also never get the furniture.

It is now November never have received a credit after bi-weekly calls and promises.  The charge is still pending on my Ashley card and I have not been given our cash back.  I guess the next step is having to go legal methods and charge them for whatever that costs!</review>< rating>

Shopping furnitures at Ashley HomeStore is always a great day! The associates are very approachable, asks what you look for in a furniture, price range, and based their recommendations on what you tell them. I never feel pressured and always leave the store satisfied with my purchase!<//Review>

We were met by Jodi and she took us step by step through the process of finding exactly the right couch for us.  We told her what we were looking for and she took us directly to several couches meeting our needs and wants.  There was no pressure to buy or go above our budget.  Jodi answered all of our questions and made the buying “experience “ a pleasure.</Review>

We have ordered several pieces and collections over the year from here. I will say that Jessy D. (Saleswoman) is awesome and Sarah (one of the new managers) is very nice. My absolute favorite there is Gretchen she makes things happen and keeps the place going.  I am NOT a fan of how the repair service goes, HOWEVER I was told they switched so I will leave 5 stars for now.</text>

We have never had a more pleasant experience with a sales person than when we purchased a leather sofa from Jessy. Jessy was extremely knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and patient with us as we were trying to decide which sofa to purchase. I would highly recommend you ask for Jessy when visiting Ashley Furniture in the Fairfield/Green Valley store.<//text>

<Time>1549329895901< /Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>This is our second time purchasing furniture at Ashley in Fairfield, CA. Sherrie Hall was our sales rep this time and she does a simply fabulous, low key, no pressure job of learning what your interested in and taking you to the selection of items you might like. The store is in the process of a remodel and a bit difficult to navigate but Sherrie did the terrific job of finding us just what we wanted. Prices are fair and the quality varies to match your budget. Highly recommended!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>I came here looking for Living room furniture.  I was instantly greeted by Holly and ran into her a couple times while roaming the store. She was pleasant, helpful, sweet, kind and not overbearing, A perfect blend of customer service!  The selection of furniture is amazing and nicely set up.  I found a set I fell in love with and decided to purchase.  I had Holly help me with the purchase.  She was so patient and  sweet with me as I searched for the perfect 14 piece set.  I can’t wait for my delivery but I’m sure I will be back for other furniture needs!< /Text><response>None< /response><Name>Angela Hendry</Name><GmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5< /GmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rating>

<Text>Really disappointed, I came here looking for a bed and a TV stand. But because those arent ever bundled together, they didnt want to give me any kind of deal at all. When I conceded at a price I was unhappy with, the salesman told me my item would be delivered in 2 weeks. Which I was okay with. But 2 weeks later, I called them up and they cancelled my order and put it on back order for 3 months ahead of my purchase date. They didnt call me or even send an email telling me that it was delayed. When I called them they were rude and unhelpful in trying to figure out if they could get it to me any earlier. I spent about 2 grand here on 2 items, and dont have anything to show for it for months!<//Text><user>116654144401050396016</user><time>1581221873218< /time><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>I purchased the Shay Bedroom set. My salesperson was Joe Herbert. He was helpful and very knowledgeable about the Shay set. He explained the benefits of having a warranty and what’s actually covered on it, which made me feel comfortable purchasing the warranty. My purchase experience was very positive and I would recommend Ashley Furniture to my friends and family.  Joe was also a great salesman.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

Simon caught me by surprise and asked if I was looking for anything else. He was able to show off the breakfast table/extras stuff that was on sale. He then put together the perfect set of dishes, rug, placemats to go with our table with stools. Me and my mom saved more money than what we spent. Good on Simon for all the help. Very polite. Would ask for Simon again if I'm back soon, which I might be. 5 stars.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I  went to Ashley looking for a Sideboard/Buffet server . I didn't find anything that I like at the store. The salesman, William told me to look online and if I  found something they would order it for me and it would be at a 50% discount.  So, I did find a server; went back next day. William was unavailable to help me since he was with another customer.  He ask another salesperson to assist me. They [Phillip] did an awesome job in seeing that my order was complete and explained everything that would take place doing the delivery . Thanks again for the great customer service .</Review></record>

We came into the store looking for a sectional. Holly was an amazing sales rep who showed us around and answered all of our questions. We didn’t feel any pressure to purchase anything and the manager was great too. Holly also took the time to show us the tempurpedic mattress that was awesome! We were able to find a sectional and was able to schedule delivery on a weekend. Overall, customer service was excellent! We hope delivery will be perfect too.</review>

We’ve had our table and chairs for less than 10 months. The bench and one barstool have been broken for 3 months. They continue to say a part needs to be ordered and they’ll call me back and they never do.
DO NOT BUY FURNITURE HERE! They don’t stand by their product.<//Text>

It was a decent experience. This was the second store i visited today. On the first store i never got to speak to anyone so it was nice being greeted practically at the door at Ashley. The sales rep was very helpful and insightful however i never felt pressed to buy. It was a great experience with the exception of their being some minor computer glitch causing a minor delay on the final transaction. I will probably be returning to purchase my family room furniture there after i pay off my living room furniture that i just bought today. Jojo definitely earned my business today</Text>

Really cute furniture and awesome customer service from the Ashley team, Jessy was amazing and made me and my family super comfortable. Bought our whole bedroom set and Tempurpedic mattress from her!

Ask for Jessy for all your bedding and mattress needs! It was fun napping with you!</Review>

Just had an horrible experience with Ashley Furniture delivery. They backed their truck down our driveway which has tree branches about 9ft high and their truck is 13+ ft high. Needless to say hanging broken branches and the driveway litered with branches. Also left packing garbage on the driveway. Not professional at all. Have a complaint in and they said they would get back to me with a decision...
$199 paid for "pro delivery and set-up" 🤬

Bianca the young lady on the sales floor was exceptional. Very friendly and helpful!
The furniture seems to be good for the price.
But until the damage to the trees and mess left behind is rectified I'll have to award a very generous 2 of 5 score<//Text>

Holly and Store manager Devin were very friendly and work with me to find the best deal for what I was looking for. Great service!  The Ashley system for processing my purchase needs to be updated though. Takes too much time and is too easy to make mistakes. Holly and Devin took their time to insure everything was perfect on my very large purchase!  Thank you!< /Text>

<Review>My husband and I came to get one of the famous Ashely 14 piece living room sets and we had a fantastic experience! Our personal shopping guide Jessy D. greeted us at the door, we asked her some questions and she pointed us in the right direction. She was never hovering like most sales persons but was always there if we had any questions or concerns. My family will definitely be coming back to Ashely Furniture and asking for Jessy with all of our furniture needs.< /Review>< Time>

Went to Ashley shopping for a Sofa. My shopping ninja niece Susan discovered something  unique about Ashley. Ashley's in store prices ( even on sale) are higher than the prices for the same item at the independent  retailers that sell Ashley. However, the on line prices are far, far lower than either. The Ashley store will price match the Ashley online price. This gives you the opportunity to touch and see what you are considering  before you buy. Gives you local delivery and the opportunity to purchase their 5 year in-home damage/spill warranty at an incredibly  low price (as it is based on the price of the purchase). Because Ashley online was clearancing  the couch we selected, our out the door price at the local Store. with taxes,delivery and warranty  was 1/3  of the in store sale price.  I am dragging  my poor niece with me everywhere I go shopping now. Delivery was on time and professional<//text>

Holly West was terrific. She understood our needs, took her time, and helped us find the perfect pieces for my mom's room, at the best price. She thoroughly explained the costs, delivery and warranty. She never took a hard sales approach, but assisted us in finding what we wanted.< /text>

I needed a recliner chair with a lift for my Dad's medical condition.  Dolly one of the sales staff went way above and beyond to assist me!!  Thank you to Ashley furniture in helping assist in my Dad's recovery!  I am beyond grateful for the caring, attentive attitude, professionalism, and knowledge that Dolly showed me.  I will now always use Ashely furniture. Wonderful selection and awesome employees!!</review>

Holly immediately welcomed us and was very friendly and kind. While we were testing out different pieces of furniture, Holly cake by multiple times to check in and to make sure we were finding everything. Her customer service is superb! She is a great example of what you would look for in the customer service industry. Five stars to Holly!</Review>< pictures>

My experience at Ashley Furniture was excellent. Davina was great, she listened to what I was looking for and gave me recommendations. I was able to make my purchase within 20 minutes of being in the store and I was out within 45 minutes total!
Hoping my delivery service will be just as good! Keeping my fingers crossed!</review>

But she told me it was $3850 just to get a sale) and she ruined my credit. I have emailed and called multiple times and no resolution or response.

UPDATE: I spoke with the manager of the store and he was very helpful and understanding of my situation, however still no resolution at this time.</review>< pictures>

Came in to just look at a bedroom set for a future purchase. Salesperson (Joe) came up us and asked us if we needed any advice. Told him we're here to just look,figure out our budget for a future purchase. He then mentioned a 50 percent discount on all items in store. My wife and I couldn't pass this up. Joe was very helpful. He allowed us to take our time browsing the store and answered all our questions. I was very satisfied with the transaction. Very good deal.</Review>

Five stars for Simon who helped us find everything we needed quickly and painlessly. Simon knew about and recommended a less expensive item which I never would have thought of myself. I will shop at this store again any time I want to buy furniture (and ask for Simon) because it saved me so much money, and time and I love everything I purchased.</review>

Whether it was a cracked fireplace TV set or the drivers not bringing the appropriate paperwork to deliver on base MULTIPLE times! Our stuff was supposed to be delivered on december 4th. It’s now December 19th. The estimated delivery time is also never correct. They’ve been late. Every time. Whether to let me know they couldn’t make it on base Bc of forgotten paperwork or well then not telling me at all that they couldn’t come! On top of that. They’ve never reached out to schedule a re-delivery date. We’ve always had to call them! I will never deal with Ashley’s furniture store ever again. Ever.< /Text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>My wife and I decided on buying a new living room set for our house. Ashley, is down the street from us, so we went there to shop. Steven, the sales rep, greeted us and welcomed us to the store. We told him what we were looking for, and he spent an hour with us showing us many different products. We set our sights on a very nice leather set, as well as other items. Steven made it his mission to walk around with us and help us pick the 14 different items we got (they had a nice 14-items Labor Day Sale).
Working with the staff (especially Steven), was very friendly, professional and nice. Even the store manager came over and helped us with what we picked, and answered a few questions we had.
The set should be delivered in 2 weeks! We are excited for it and are looking forward to receiving the items.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>The store - clean, organized, well presented products that makes the shopping experience wonderful.

The customer service - Jessica was knowledgeable, polite, and pleasant who explained the products and the services very well.

We bought our first set of furnitures from Ashley 9 years ago and we returned to get a whole new set. We were welcomed very well by Jessica, gave us space to look around, and once we decided, she assisted us right away and answered all our questions. Even gave us a discount. We ended up buying a bedroom set, a dining set, and a sectional sofa.

Ashley is the place to go.<//Text>< UserId.>

Bianca had excellent customer service she assisted us immediately asked us how we are doing and explained everything clearly. She also told us about the current promotions the 14Piece sets and how it works. She was friendly easy to talk to knowledgeable and experienced we felt very comfortable and delighted to do business with her. Before we came in we had a bad impression of Ashley’s Furniture and she completely changed that! If you go in I highly recommend asking for her! We will be back! 😁<//review>

<review>We have been long time customers of Ashley home store in Fairfield. From couches, bed sets, tables whatever we needed we went there. However that change this year. The last 2 times we went we've had trouble with deliveries, and the very time the representative that helped us had no knowledge of anything. We bought a table and it said "next day delivery" on the sale price on the table. Nope no next day delivery available and she couldnt say why. We we're debating between 2 tables but liked the table we purchase just a little bit more so we set up delivery for 2 weeks later, that was as soon as they had. Delivery day gets here and wouldn't you know they were back ordered on 2 chairs, how would the representative that sold us the table not know the chairs were back ordered when she placed the order. Also we were never notified of that within the weeks that we waited for the table. My husband calls and the woman on the phone tells him the chairs are on the truck the delivery guy is telling my husband no the chairs are not on the truck because they are back ordered. My husband tries to pass the delivery driver the phone to speak with the woman and he refused saying "he doesnt work for Ashley's and is just delivering what's on the truck" So after about 5 minutes of my husband going back-and-forth with the two individuals the woman finally says they are on back ordered and she apologized. The delivery man nor the woman on the phone had any knowledge of when the chairs were going to be back in stock and when we would get them, again we had company over that night and we were down 2 chairs which was pretty embarrassing. I Tell my husband it's unacceptable that we paid for something yet we have no idea when we would get them, so we call them the next business day, no apologies when we called Ashley's, no trying to make it right somehow, nothing. Just an "oh yes that sucks but your chairs will be there next Friday. With American furniture galleries and other furniture companies that offer equal quality and better pricing coming back around you would think Ashelys would try and keep their loyal customers and it seemed like they couldn't care less.< /review><response>None</response>< date>

<text>Long story short, our sales person Iyanna was awesome.

Management was pushy on the warranty.(Didn't buy)

Truck showed up on scheduled date but was missing pieces of our table...  including hardware..

The lamps sent were wrong.

Our glassware was on back order. (Set delivery 3 weeks after purchase date to insure everything arrives together... guess again..

Lastly, our bedroom set.. that was all there to end on a good note.

First and last for Ashley's.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5</gmap_id></record>

I had the greatest experience, Lyanna was AWESOME! Ashley furniture definitely needs more workers like her. I wanted to bring her Starbucks because I felt she had patience with me and I like that she didn’t pressure me. Besides her great customer service I know she will be an outstanding candidate. It would’ve been 5 star if the company can offer a bottle of water or coffee! Thanks again Lyanna!< /Text>

Beautiful selection and worked out a good price. Manager was very helpful along with the second worker.  The only thing was we were disregarded by the first person when we came in and instead of helping us he just said oh yea dressers are everywhere go look around. I’m assuming because my wife and I are a young couple, but we wind up buying an entire bedroom set instead of just a dresser because of the service that was eventually provided by I believe Alyssa.<//Review>

I would like to thank Ashley Furniture for the great deal they offered on a new sectional sofa with ottoman. As soon as we walked into the store the sales staff welcome us. The staff right away asked “what we were looking for as far as stiles in furniture” and they helped in making the selection without the pressure that you normally would get from salespeople. Ashley also offered financing at 0% as well as different discounts for 0 down or cash payout. This is the first time we bought furniture from the store and we hope to get a bedroom set on our next visit.

Thx (Joseph) Ashley.</Text>

Bianca helped me out a great deal and I appreciate her for it.  Her and William know how to treat consumers I can’t exactly say the same for their superiors .  5 stars for Bianca & William. If I had to give the general staff a rating it’ll be a 3 so average it out to 3.5 stars overall< /Text>

<Review>I hit the jackpot on my purchase of a new sofa.  My salesperson, Karen, was the most knowledgeable and helpful sales associate I've ever encountered.  She found exactly what I needed at an extremely affordable price.  I can't say enough as to how impressed I was with her poise, knowledge and assistance.

My delivery was also spot on. I was called 2 days before to alert me to my estimated deliver time.  Day of delivery, I got a call 10 minutes before delivery, truck arrived and my couch was professionally set up in less than 10 minutes.  The sofa is of a very good quality for the price -- I look forward to many years of enjoyment with my purchase.< /Review><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Very nice quality furniture. Found everything I wanted to furnish an entire room and more. Will definitely come back when shopping for quality products and good service.
THIS REVIEW WAS POSTED BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF MY FURNITURE. IT HAS BEEN A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE SINCE THAT DAY!!! I SPENT ALMOST $8,000 IN THE STORE PURCHASING 33 ITEMS. 14 OF THE WERE DAMAGED OR BROKEN!!! UNACCEPTABLE!!! AFTER HOLDING FOR 35 MIN I WAS ABLE TO GET AHOLD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SENT SOMEONE OUT. ALL HE DID WAS TAKE PICS. I HAD ALREADY APWBT 2 HOURS TAKING PICS AND DOCUMENTING THE ITEMS THAT HAD DAMAGE.ACUSTOMER SERVICE WANTS TO REPAIR THE FURNITURE NOT REPLACE IT. THEY SENT ME REPLACEMENT PARTS SAYING THAT IF I CANNOT FIX IT MYSELF THEY  WIUcLD SEND A TECHNICIAN TO MY HOUSE.</Text>

Sherrie, Gretchen, and Jose are the only great thing about this store. They are professional, helpful, and compassionate. Far more than I can say about the management at the Fairfield Ashley.
Besides the few people listed above, we have had the WORST experience at this store. The manager (I use that term only because it’s on his name tag, and NOT because he acts the part) Perry is one of the most pompous, dismissive, unreliable people I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. We had multiple issues with the 3 deliveries we purchased through them. We were promised correspondence with Gary (the district manager). After many back and forth phone calls with the store, and Perry refusing to come to the phone, we were never able to get ahold of either men.
The issues we had with the store are far to long to type out here, and I am far too frustrated to do so. But please, if you value your money, your time, and your self worth, DONT VISIT THIS STORE.< /review>< Rate>

<review>This was the best experience I could've asked for! I was already stressed out because of online purchase with Living Spaces, which was a disaster.  My daughter needs a bed and mattress set asap, and Steve Lassen helped us find what we wanted quickly and at the right price!

I know where to start and buy next time. Thank you Steve!!!

Overall it was a good experience. Went in to look for a couch and came out with a bed frame and a new mattress. Not disappointed however. Jojo was a great help and very sweet and although she seemed to be juggling many customers she still helped us along the whole process. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the delivery is going to be two weeks. I was hoping to get it a little sooner.< /Text>

<review>My family and I went looking for an entertainment center for our living room. Steven was at the door to welcome us in and also answered all of our questions. Best thing thing of all he wasn't hovering over us to get the sale. He gave us the product at the best price and set up a convenient date for our delivery.

We will be back, thank you!

I had a bad situation that turned out for the better.  Jenelle had contacted me, asking me had I received my items yet and how did I like them (great/old school customer service!) which at that point I hadn't yet but when I pulled up to my home I noticed that I received a package from Ashley, it was also very clear that the box was in distress so the odds of the actual product surviving was slim to none and surely once I opened the item was heavily damaged.  I was distraught due to the fact that i needed that table before my kids moved into the home.  I immediately contacted Jenelle and explained my dissatisfaction. She was extremely attentive and made me feel like a priority. She kept constant contact to keep me updated.  A few days later I spoke with customer service reps Gretchen and Alaijah as well as sales rep Bianca and they were nothing short of amazing with making sure I got my table on-time by my deadline.  I really appreciate how the staff worked together to make everything right!< /text>

<review>Went to Ashley to buy furnitures and other stuff for our new house. Taylor helped us throughout all the process not just for a day but for three days (because we couldn’t decide). She was really patient with us. We spent almost 4 hrs working with her and that’s just for a day. She helped us pick our mattresses, made us try them and she even put a clean sheet on the bed before trying. She helped me pick out my bed set too and she was honest about the fact that the bed I originally wanted isn’t real wood, that it can wear off for some years. I am glad she told that and saved me from wasting my money. Overall, no complaints and I do really recommend her!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Excellent quality furniture, horrible, useless customer service.  Been that way for years, nothing has changed.  I called their main office in LA.  He said I called the wrong extension and will connect me to the store.  I was on hold forever.  He came back on the line every now and then to check if I was still there.  I asked what's taking so long?  He said the Fairfield store is notorious for not answering the phone.  I said why is that?  He said  "well for lack of a better word, they just suck."  THEIR OWN REP SAID THAT!  Wow, it's no secret.  I used to by my furniture from Hanks, down in San Jose.  When he passed away the store closed.  Been there for 50 years.  That was the best place to buy furniture.</Text>

I called to see if a sofa was at the store and talked to a gentleman named William, he was extremely polite and let me know that they did have it there. It was on sale for 50%off so it ended up being a really great deal. William was courteous and did not pressure me to buy more items, all in all it was a very painless experience, I was in and out in no time at all with the sofa I found online at a great price!< /text>

Tiffany and Tenia were both fabulous in helping us select our living room set. I didn't feel like either of them were pushy or trying to upsale us, which I really appreciated. Shopping at Ashley was a pleasant experience overall and we're looking forward to our new furniture. 😊< /Review>

<text>So far the experience has been great. We told the sales rep what we wanted, he took us to those items, and a couple that we may have considered. He explained pricing and we made our purchase. Hopefully the rest goes as smoothly!<//text>< Pics>

<name>Mikolaj</name><time>1526237234218</time><rating>5</rating><Review>The professionalism put towards my experience at this specific location far exceeded the numerous stores visited over the past few days.  Upon entering the staff greeted and pointed me as a customer towards my needs.  After being allowed to browse without interruption the associate began her process of indulging and pinpointing a price about a particular piece which caught my eye. Any concern or question was handled not only by the associate, but at this point the manager began getting involved in the process.  Their knowledge about what the customer needs made the purchase of quality furniture from the team seamless and comfortable. In ending after being allowed to negotiate without any eye rolling, which was experienced in a plethora of other furniture stores, it was a pleasure doing business with this particular store and sales team. Simple and top notch experience.</Review>< Pictures>

Our experience purchasing our sectional couch from Ashley Furniture in Fairfield was very positive. Steve helped & assisted us with our purchase, instead of pressuring us. We took our time, even an additional day to compare it to another sectional we were considering from a different store. After deciding to go with Ashley's sectional, the process went very smooth. I applaud Steve for his professional & people skills to make the buying environment very comfortable and easy. Thank you for an enjoyable purchase, very pleased with it.<//review>

We worked with The Keith™️ on our visit here. Keith gave us enough space so we could make our decision in Peace™️, but was (eventually) able to be tracked down each time we needed help. We are happy with our purchase! He didn’t try to push anything extra on us that we didn’t want either. Thanks Keith S.!< /text>

Great first time experience. Salesman Kevin Jones was very knowledgeable concerning my inquiry, directed/guided me.... didn't hover over me !!! and made himself available for questions. I initially was there to purchase kitchen chairs, and ended up purchasing  leather double recliner) which I had been looking to purchase for months) No hard sale   Tactics absolutely no pressure from the salesman to purchase at this time ,  I will definitely revisit Ashley furniture in Fairfield for my next purchase. Thank you<//text>

<text>Called ahead and got Krystal, told her what I wanted. I drove the hour to get there and she was not available. Talked to a gentleman about purchasing a recliner, floor model I could take home. Found one but none of the men "standing around" would assist me to carry out. Holly came by and she was willing to assist me if purchased. Krystal came back and she was willing to assist me also. Cheers to these wonderful women for helping me today.
One man, Steve, did help in the end. Krystal was my agent and she was wonderful. I will go back but request only Holly or Krystal.< /text>< Pics>

Today Ashley furniture gave us a great experience at their Fairfield store. Both our salesperson Davina and  the store mgr  made our purchasing experience smooth and easy. Customer service was top shelf and prices were very competitive. We highly recommend this Branch for anybody who's looking for any beautiful high-end furniture or decor.

I walked in the the Fairfield store today and greeted by a young lady named Bianca . She walked me through the store and the area where most of the Recliners were. I felt very comfortable while there. It is so good to walk into a store now a days with sales people that want to help a customer. I am retired now but ran Chains of retail  Jewelry stores . I also trained people how to run stores and how to treat customers. I would of loved to have a young lady like Bianca on my sales floor.<//Review>

<Review>My daughter and I walked in to Ashley furniture this past Saturday afternoon to look at living room sets, and were helped immediately by Chris Velez, a very knowledgeable sales associate.   After hearing what we were looking for, Chris directed us to a couple different areas to browse, and came back to check on us a couple of times to see if we had any questions. We had narrowed our search down to one set, but we weren’t wild about the tables and lamps that came with it.  Chris informed us that we could make up our own “custom” package and that he would come up with some good pricing for that custom package.  We ended up buying a dining set as well, and also purchased an insurance plan for our new furniture. Chris  gave us some really fair pricing, helped to set up our new charge account (with 0% interest due on our three-year purchase!), and added some friendly conversation mixed in between the business transaction.

We had a wonderful experience at Ashley furniture, and Chris is definitely a valuable asset to the company. He is very knowledgeable, pleasant, and considerate; at no time did we feel any sales pressure. All in all, we would recommend him and the Fairfield  Ashley furniture to all of our friends and family. We will definitely be repeat customers!< /Review>< Pictures>

Ms Lanece warmly greeted me at the door as I entered the store and walked me pleasantly through it, to my dream bedroom set and met all my needs. The manager, then came and closed me out, with what I think was a great deal for the money that I spent. I will return!< /Text>

Holly West greeted my son and I as soon as we walked in.  We liked that she didn't shadow us around the store, but did check in with us a couple of times.  We appreciated the way she was so courteous, yet business like.  She had great knowledge of the furniture we liked.  We came back the same day, to relook at the furniture, again making contact with Holly.  She was never pushy, we didn't come back to actually buy the furniture for another 6 days, and she remembered us, and it was like seeing an old friend.  She is definitely someone I would hire if I owned a business.< /review>

Hi, I just want to share my Review with you, me and my sister went Sunday February 17th to bought bedroom set and Derek M help us to get it through with his best customer service, extent deal , very friendly and helpful, then today February 21st I decide to go and get sofa set for myself and some how I end up dealing with Mr Gregg Mochides , he start with some high numbers which don’t fit in budget and ask for some better deal , in his mind he thinks that I’m very cheap bargainer and he become so rude and disrespectful to me and he walk away from me and just mumbling something bad about me, then I talk to the on duty manager Perry Thomas about him and he apologize and ask Jessy D to help me , which turned out very happy transaction, she is the best , so do perry , excellent customer service and very good price, ,,< /Review>

I was looking for a couch a couple months ago and went into the Ashley Homestore in Cordelia. Divine V. assisted me during the process and was very helpful and I found and purchased a couch I love. I returned to the store today and once again Devina V assisted me and remembered me from my original visit. She assisted me in finding a recliner. She is very helpful and knowledgeable and I would return to this location because of her. Thank you Devina V :)<//Review>

I’m really pleased with the services here. I found exactly what I’ve been looking for. A three piece sectional sofa. The sales rep, Jessy was very helpful, professional, and sweet. I will definitely be coming back here soon for more furniture in the future.</review>

If I could post a negative 5 Star review for their follow up customer service, I would! My spouse and I bought a love seat from Ashley in Fairfield, approximately 1 1/2 months ago, which was delivered by two non-English individuals. They shoved it through the door, almost breaking it. We signed for it and they left. We inspected the love seat, after they left , and a flaw was found. We contacted Ashley and a technician/repair man was scheduled. We waited 2-3 weeks for him to come out because of scheduling difficulties. When the technician came out, he  indicated that they would order replacement parts and they would fix it in our living room. When asked what that meant, he said they would undo the back of the love seat pull it apart along with the front cushion and repair it. At that moment we said "No". We felt the extent of repair to this degree was unacceptable, and to have it done in our living room was definitely unacceptable. We purchased a new love seat not a damaged one. The technician said he would make that note (replace vs repair) and we should hear from Ashley within 7-10 days. We DID NOT hear from them! We waited 3 weeks and still never heard from them. I begin to make calls only to get the run around from their customer service department. I even called their corporate office, and the customer service person there was no help. Ashley does NOT stand behind their product and we had even purchased the EXTENDED Warranty. Apparently this too, was a waste of money. If you're looking for new furniture, rethink purchasing from Ashley.< /text>

<Text>The sales person, Holly, was very helpful and very patient with us as we  contemplated buying the sofa and love seat . She made the experience very pleasant and was truly one of the better sales people we worked with.
The sales manager in the store was very people friendly, and I think gave us a price we certainly could live with. All in all a very good experience.<//Text>< Pictures>

Excellent...I spoke to KO on Wednesday regarding a sofa I wanted he told me to come in although he was not working on Thursday but Ms. Holly would take good care of me.  First let me start with KO,  he was very knowledgeable about the item I was looking for, he provided me with great customer service he never rushed me off the phone and I had a million questions he took all the time I needed over the phone to get me prepared for my arrival.  Ms. Holly thank you so much such a sweet lady I knew what I wanted but there was so much to see.  She made me feel so comfortable it felt like I was shopping with a friend.  Ms Holly is truly a professional they both deserve more than 5 stars.....< /text>

First, they delivered the wrong couch. Which meant I had to call their warehouse, wait on hold for close to an hour to reschedule the delivery. Yes, I had to make the call. I called the store to let them know and requested a credit for the delivery fee back to my account. They said they would. Then when they delivered a broken couch. I then had to call again, waiting on hold for close to an hour, to schedule a repair. I called the store again letting them know about the broken couch, they said they would issue me a store credit on top of the credit for the delivery fee. The repair person came and said he had to order parts. Then once the parts arrived I would have to call the warehouse again to schedule the repair. It took close to two weeks to get the parts and again I called, waited the hour and made my appointment. I called the store again today to see why I haven't received my credit to the card or my store credit. The person I spoke to was very nice but wouldn't be able to help me until Saturday when the Finance Director was in. This is insane, still no credit to my card, still no store credit three months later. I have had to work so hard to get my items, countless calls and emails and no one has been able to help me. It seems to me that you should not have to work this hard to get items that you bought. I will never go back or recommend this to anyone after I use my store credit, if I ever get it, you would have better luck with Target or Walmart with much less hassle.< /Text>< Pics>

Very patient & helpful!
As a retired salesman of 40+ years, I like to stretch out the prosess to evaluate their demeanor. A habit after 20 years of training sales persons.
If I did not buy, I didn’t enjoy the experience, but I did buy and will buy more at Ashley going forward.
Thanks again......Carl<//text>

<text>I purchased a sofa set in October 2016 and was very pleased with service and furniture.  The associate that helped me was Holly West, she was extremely helpful, patient and knowledge of the different products offered.  I will definitely be purchasing furniture in the future and will recommend this store to my friends.</text></record></dataset><record>

If you need to purchase any type of furniture at this store, request for Holy West. She is very honed in customer service and works with your budget to get you the best deals. Unlike other sales associates I have met, she was interested in pleasing the client and making the purchase as seem less and easy as possible. Loved the store, but loved her the most!<//Review>

We all know how salesman can be and sometimes we prefer on line shopping because of this. He never pressured me once. He LISTENED to MY NEEDS & WANTS and delivered me the best deal I could get. I made a suggestion in regards to the misleading information I obtained from financial services and he took it right to his manager to get clarification on how to adddress with future consumers. I was really impressed with the entire store wanting to do the right thing . I will be back to finish the last room of my house very soon. I’m super pleased and encourage you to visit this store.

<review>Staff are always prompt to greet
Prices are clearly stated and easy to understand, as far as "Manager Special" advertisement.  Several purchases and the quality is decent for daily usage.  The store is clean, and has a wide variety of furnishing to fit every household.  To date I've had no problem with my purchases.</review>< rate>

We bought 3 rooms of furniture from this location. Beautiful selection, great price, and we love everything we got. However, one of the pieces to our bed frame was a bit too short. When we called to get it replaced, they had to send a technician almost a week after to look at it and order it even though we already knew exactly what piece we needed. He said the part should be delivered in about a week after that. It has been more than a week and it hasn't arrived. When I called the store to check in, the representative I spoke to was very rude and when I explained the situation, she took a long pause and said "well what do you want me to do" with a horrible attitude. She then rushed me off the phone. Without the piece, we are unable to finish putting the frame together, so we haven't been able to sleep on the bed in the almost month that we've had everything delivered. I would not recommend buying from this location unless you're okay with month long waits for deliveries and rude customer service.

Edit: The piece finally came and it was the same exact piece that was too short to begin with. We were told that the technician had to come to ensure that they ordered the correct piece. It has now been a month and, at this point, we just want to return the bed because attempting to get the right piece will only result in waiting even longer. I'm very disappointed in the lack of customer service and definitely would not recommend to anyone. In my recent phone call to the store regarding the request for a return, I was given the number to customer care and told that they would be able to help me. Upon calling, customer care told me that there's nothing that they can do and told me I had to call the store I purchased from. So now I'm being sent in circles trying to get help.<//Text>

Ronald, our sales person was wonderful, and he made sure we met Devin, the manager, who was very generous with our purchases. They were both extremely sensitive and caring. I had never considered Ashley Furnishings in the past, but based on the merchandise, pricing and quality service, they  definitely have made friends for life.</review>< userid>

<review>I bought all my house furniture at this Ashely’s Fairfield store in March and my nightmarish journey began. Please stay away if you could. The issues with this particular store are numerous, these were my main experiences:

1. There were no sales agents available and customers were seated on the couches awaiting help. I spent about 3 hours in the store, on a 30 minute transaction.

2. They delivered a broken couch to my house and refused to take it back saying it’s store policy that a technician has to check it out first. The technician came a month later and stated I need a new couch which will take 7-10 business days to replace. I’m currently out of a functional couch.

3. It’s IMPOSSIBLE to reach the store directly via phone call. You’ll be on hold on average 15 mins and be rerouted to another location (usually in SoCal)

4. My delivery for my mattress and bed which was 3 weeks late due to back order was logged as delivered and my order was closed even though NOTHING was delivered to me! I had to call 4 different corporate numbers to get a new order made. Even corporate had problems accessing the store manager (Perry) and I had to physically leave work to go to the store and get the matter resolved.

If 0 stars is an option I would have selected it. I will never shop at this store again and I strongly recommend any consumer from doing it, once they take your money, you’re on your own. They’ll give you the corporate run around for months after purchase.</review>< user_name>

<review>Went in Saturday and talked to Karen about a table, she was very helpful and worked a good deal for me with the manager that night. Went  Home to measure to make sure the table would fit and came back the next day .   The manager the next day at first didn’t seem to want to make the same deal. Although after a brief discussion Karen and the manager of the day agreed to the deal that was made the night before. What could’ve been a disappointing problem was worked out in the end and I was satisfied with the outcome. I will go there again.</review>< user_id>

Joe was the sales person that helped me pick out my furniture. He was really helpful and made the experience 10x better, because of his personality and made me feel like we were friends instead of a sales person. I really appreciate his kindness and I will definitely return to him for my next purchase. Thanks Joe!< /review>

<rating>2</rating><review>Where do I begin, first step into the door was, ok; opened with a joke- good,good,good. Then we got the “in training” associate, self-described. Well, let’s just say it was all downhill from here.
The associate was very deflective in regard to the wait time and very much so during the actually purchase process. During our introduction she came and went as if she was searching out a couch that we could take a look at, but of the four or five times she did this returned nothing to take a look at.
Then the real waiting game began. Ready to purchase and my fiancé and I were held up for what seemed to be about half an hour. The additional wait was due to a payment kiosk “not working” most things don’t if they aren’t powered on. Associate calls for an IT helper, who can’t figure it out either.
Hmmm...
The whole time the surge protector to the desktop computer and verfione credit card acceptor was not switched on..
I end up turning the dang machines on and finally my payment is accepted.
Oh dear baby Jesus.</review>< Pics>

Visited Ashley home furniture in Fairfield and worked with Jessie, who was amazing. She made the process if finding what I liked matching to my budget and needs. She was great and we had a great time. No pressure, no railroading just honest help. I bought a bed and a vouch with love seat. Then I went back for a dresser and end tables. Jessie was easy to work with. Professional but fun and we searched until I was happy. Great deal and great knowledge of her products. I will return again and my daughter went and bought too. I highly recommend Jessie at Fairfield Ashley Home furniture< /Text>

We have bought a lot of furniture from Ashley Furniture thru the year. Have been happy with the quality. Not the throw away furniture like from IKEA. I truly believe you get what you pay for.
Jessy G is our go to salesperson at the Fairfield store. She really helps make the furniture buying experience easy. She treats you like family. I can honestly say she’s like family to us. She has taken care of our family on many occasions of our visits to the store. A great person, and the main reason we will continue to come back for our family’s home environment needs as I like to say. Thanks again Jessy! You’re awesome!

<rate>1<//rate><review>DO NOT SHOP AT THIS STORE!  I have had the WORST experience with this store.  We purchased an entertainment center, two sofas, coffee tables, two night stands, a dresser, headboard, and bed frame on May 3rd with a delivery date of June 1st.  June 1st rolls around and only the entertainment center was delivered.  They informed me the remaining items would be delivered June 7th.
Fast forward to June 7th, 2019 NO ONE SHOWS UP!  I waiting around all day no delivery came.  I went to the store and they said there was an issue with the driver.  I heard three different stories.  How can you not contact your customers letting them know there was an issue and the delivery wouldn't be arriving!
Then they said delivery would occur on June 8th, 2019.  June 8th comes and the headboard was delivered broken!  The delivery team take it back and we go down to the store to have this reorder a new headboard.  Fast forward to June 24th, 2019 and the headboard is arriving.  They show up BUT now there is no hardware to assemble the bed!!!!  Having almost been 2 months since the original order date my husband and I decide we do not want this anymore and don't want our money going to a company that has horrible customer service.  We go down The ladies that work at the back desk were AMAZING!  They did all they can to try and resolve the issue and get us our refund and return.  The manager just walked around goofing around with employees and did not come over to help.  When he finally did walk by and the employee tried stopping him to get his help his exact words were "this wasn't handled?!" and he rolled his eyes.  He of course tried getting me to keep the furniture and I told him multiple times that I do not want this furniture.  Finally after stating it literally maybe 20 times he finally realized I am serious and then he informs me that he can't authorize a return.  The regional manager has to so they call and email him but can not get a hold of him.
The next day June 25th, 2019 the regional manager Gary calls me.  He tries to get me to keep the furniture.  I once again have to say multiple times that I DO NOT WANT IT.  He then precedes to tell me four times that it will be picked up on Friday, June 28th, 2019.  I go into the store to get it all sorted out to make sure I get my refund and the manager NEVER came over to check and make sure everything was going okay.  Other employees came to check but the manager NEVER came!
Fast forward to today June 28th, 2019.  IT DOES NOT GET PICKED UP!  I wait around for the truck and when they arrive it is to deliver the headboard!  I call the store and they say the pick up is for Monday, July 1st, 2019.  WHY would they deliver an item that is already in their system as a return/refund!!!

DO NOT SHOP AT THIS STORE!  Possibly the other stores may have better customer service but the manager at this store DOES NOT!  Which is sad because Jojo, Gretchen and Aisha (I hope I spelled that right) were GREAT!  They tried everything they can to make sure they did everything they could but the manager DID NOT!  If I could give ZERO stars I would.<//review></record>

I was helped by Meelah and she was able to price match a really good price on the dining set table and chairs I was interested in. All in all I had a great experience at this location and I would shop there again.
I do have a minor suggestion, and this is in general for corporate. Making the online store completely separate from the physical stores so that your own employees cannot access any online orders of individuals who pay good money for your products is unacceptable. By doing such a thing you are impeding people who buy products online from getting the same amount of services as those who purchase online. Fix it.<//Text>< pics>

<review>I want to start by saying my experience was excellent. I was worried as I walked in the door I did not get the best welcoming, however within a minute or so Steven came over and spoke with us and offered his services. He didnt push any products on me, but was very open and understanding of my budget, while being honest regarding quality. I appreciated his service and would recommend him personally.< /review><username>Narcissa Wilson< /username>< rate>

<Text>Delivery not scheduled by the salesperson at the store according to your tracking staff when I called to check on the delivery.  It was 1 pm when I called after staying home unnecessarily.
The delivery was rescheduled and delayed 3 days for an Ashley error.
Tables delivered with several imperfections on table edges .  We could not return the one table without returning all 3 in the set. They were cheap and Managers specials for a reason. We decided to just just keep them as is.
Not happy and likely will not shop there anymore.</Text><Time>1570740434792< /Time><resp>None<//resp><username>Cathy Nugent<//username>< pictures>

HORRIBLE! GO TO YELP AND READ REVIEWS! Worst customer service experience buying so called "top of the line furniture".They need to lower their prices if they are going to provide horrible service to people! Dont buy anything from them , if you do , better hope nothing Is wrong with it or they deliver the wrong thing.Dont bother calling customer service.You will have to physically go to the store to get any help at all. GO TO YELP AND READ REVIEWS BERFORE YOU GO THERE! I dont see how Google has them at 4.5 stars!!< /review>

We just had the best experience possible. We were greeted by Lanece at the door and and she helped us until the end. She was very patient with us, very helpful and so very nice. Henry the assistant Manager came and helped me decide what would be best for my family. He answered all my questions even the crazy questions I had. All I can say and I've never written a review about a place before but I felt so good about this experience that I wanted to share and say THANK YOU to everyone there. Lanece, Henry, the ladies behind the counter, just everyone. It was truly something great and we appreciate it so very much. Thanks again.<//Text>

I wish that we would have read the Yelp and Google reviews before purchasing our couch.  We have sat (Well not sat, we moved our furniture out and have an empty living room) all day waiting for a delivery.  We called the store and our item is still there.  Now they want to reschedule tomorrow.  According to all of the reviews, my husband should not take time off until the truck actually arrives.  We are headed to store now and will probably cancel our purchase.  There is no customer service left!</review>

I went into the store thinking I wasn’t going to make a purchase but then I fell in love with a bed set! There was someone there (Ali) who was ready to help me without being pushy. She was very flexible, I changed my mind a few times and she was able to help me get exactly what I wanted. Can’t wait to get my bed set!!<//text>

Josephine was a huge help! She had tons of patience while my husband and I (and our 3 year old and 2 year old) shopped for a new mattress. I felt super comfortable here and didn't feel pressured to buy anything I didn't want to. Would totally recommend anyone to buy their home furnishings here.< /Review>

I bought a Stunning Bedroom Set! There was a great deal I couldn't pass up. Sales associate Divina tended to me with knowledge , helped me in getting financial approval and from there everything was a breeze! She is super friendly :) she's there Tues and Wednesday . I hope I got that rite. Looking forward to my new Furniture!</Review>

<review>While shopping at Ashley Furniture Store in Fairfield Ca, A young lady who went by the name of Jo-Jo kindly gave me a tour of the store, then guided me to the area of my interest. Jo-Jo also showed me other options which I was pleased with. She also showed me the rugs section. Her options of rugs were with great taste. Afterwards I made my decision and completed my purchase. Jo-Jo has great hospitality and very enjoyable.< /review>< pics>

I had to call them. They said it didn't make it on the truck. The next time they called me 10 minutes before the delivery time was supposed to start. It was still on back order.

Great service. We were greeted at the door and Holly took us right to the item we were looking for. It was a sale item and we had to make a decision fast due to the fact that they were almost out of the item. The store had a lot of items there bit we went for just this one piece of furniture.</Review>

I appreciated her warm welcoming spirir , her infectious positive attitude and how she worked very hard to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase and that she was not just trying to make a sale.

Absolutely awesome experience in our interaction with JoJo in the Cordelia store. She is a top of the line sales person and representative for Ashley Furniture. They are very blessed to have her. She is very knowledgeable and helpful in every single facet of her job. We went in to purchase a couch. We left after a purchase of a complete living room, bedroom, and dining room set. Not to mention some accessories to go with them. We will definitely refer all of our friends and family to Ashley and have them ask for JoJo💕< /Text>

Our sales person, Ali, was awesome. She took time to make sure we had our minds made up and didn’t push us into a decision. It took about 3 hours for us to figure everything out and she was patient. I think her name was Alison. She was anazing<//Text>

<user>117931149648917912600</user><Text>Went into my local Ashley Store to look for a bedroom set for my 16 year old daughter .. I'm in Sales , so I'm very turned off by "high pressure" sales people . This particular store was AWESOME to deal with !! From the beginning to the end , I never felt pressured and was thrilled to work with the professional people in the store , they were accommodating , sincere, honest , and willing to deal with me . Got to meet the District Manager that day and also the General Manager Devin .. both ( in my opinion) were the bomb !! They went above and beyond to get my daughter the bedroom set she was set on getting at a great price .. thank you to ALL of the employees at this Ashley's in Fairfield.. I would highly recommend this store to anyone wanting to buy home furnishings.. you won't regret visiting this store .. great stuff and excellent service .. even to the delivery guys who had to put up with me moving the furniture around ..and not complain .. all I can say is AWESOME!!!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

Typical furnature store has a wide selection of items and prices.  Sales people were definitely above average in that they checked in and then left me alone.  No constantly asking me if I needed help.  Furniture is not Eathan Allen level but decent low mid range.</Review>

<Name>William Kearney<//Name><Date>1536108791402<//Date><rate>1</rate><text>We purchased a sofa, loveseat, tables etc. including the protection plan approximate 1 year ago.
A seam is separating in the sofa due to defective workmanship.  I contacted Ashley’s and they stated that is not covered in the warranty.  Kinda funny because when we bought the 5 year warranty we were told that it covered everything including burns, tears etc.
In other words if I cut the sofa with a knife or burned it they would fix it.  However, they do not fix defective workmanship including seams coming apart.
Do yourself a favor and shop at an honest, reputable furniture store, not Ashley’s.

<review>They have a good selection of furniture but I think most of their things are over priced as I found the same exact things somewhere else for cheaper. Their costumer service sucks , I ordered a lot of furniture from them to furnish my new home. They ended up not shipping a few things and when I called it was hard for me to actually talk to someone to help me. So I had to physically go there to get it resolved. Come to find some of my items were not available till months months later. I actually had to go there a few times because they would send some things but miss other things. And the people trying to figure out why it wasn't sent have really no idea what they're doing And it takes long for them to figure out what went wrong. It was more of a hassle than anything. I just gave up on a painting for my daughters room that never came. It came in a furniture package and it was more of a headache to keep dealing with them and trying to argue for it ,  I just let that item slide. About exactly a year later the item arrives. A whole year! lol and also I think they had also sent a wrong item. This place is so dis organized. I wouldn't recommend this place , save yourself the headache and trouble.</review>< Pics>

We had a great experience with Ashley furniture in Fairfield. We purchased a new living room set and dinning set, which included area rugs and multiple accessories. Our sales representative, Divina, was extremely helpful. She was so patient with us as we took HOURS to figure out what we wanted and she helped us every step of the way. She was able to answer all our questions throughout the entire process. She must have walked that showroom with us over 10 times, and she never made us feel like we were taking too long, and like I said we were there for HOURS!!</review>

<text>I just moved to Fairfield, stopped at Ashley Furniture to shop for my new apartment needs.  Was greeted by a beautiful young smiling, friendly professional named JoJo.  Within a few minutes I picked out a dining room set. Jojo was very helpful letting me know earliest delivery dates on my choice items that was very important to me.  Next I chose a bedroom set for my son. Very happy with my choices, thought I was done for the day.  I received a great deal on my purchases "Managers Specials".  As I walked out the door, I saw a beautiful media center with a heater and light effects.  I fell in love with it and went back to Jojo to purchase it.  By that time the Ashley Store Manager, wonderfully talented Perry Thomas came to approve the discounts.  He asked me about my furniture needs, I was tired and confused.  Within a few minutes these interior design professionals JoJo and Perry walked me through choosing a sectional set I absolutely love.  The set came with tables lamps and pillows.  I was in awe of the energy and willingness to help me find just the right extra pieces I needed to create the home of my dreams.  Thank you Soo much Ashley Furniture..
The next day I brought back my son after purchasing two bedroom sets living roor and dining sets plus art and rugs.  My son wanted to upgrade his bed to a nicer one.  We also swapped out the dining set and the rug and art and clock.  Talk about work.  JoJo and Perry tirelessly helped us with our new furniture ideas without hesitation.  They both took their time and expertise to select the right lamps that matched my son's new bedroom set.  Was so much fun and I can't say enough about Perry Thomas and my girl JoJo who cut my purchase prices in half with discounts.  JoJo even texted me on her time off to update me on delivery of my 40 items.  Delivery for my first items is tomorrow.  The rest next Sunday.  Can't wait for my lovely new furniture.  Couldn't have done it without JoJo and Mr. Perry Thomas come to find out was interior designer at Restoration Hardware.  How lucky are we to have him at our fingertips.  I am Soo happy.  Thank you.

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Horrible management aka Perry Thomas!

On 12/23/18 I purchased just over $2700 from the Ashley's Furniture Store in Fairfield Ca. Where I payed in full and in cash. That day I scheduled a delivery for 2/15/19. About a week and a half before my delivery date I called the customer care number to push back my delivery to 2/23/19 since the remolding of both  my bathrooms & new flooring weren't completed. On 2/13/19 I get a text saying I need to confirm my confirmation of delivery for the 2/15/19 or else my furniture won't be placed on the truck. Well, why would it? I had called a week & a half earlier to change the delivery date. When I called customer care back they stated that, that wasn't done but they could reschedule then. So she rescheduled for 2/23/19. On 2/21/19 I received another text stating I needed to confirm delivery for 2/23/19 or call customer care to reschedule. I had to call customer care because my bathrooms we're now completed but the flooring was still unfinished. So, I pushed it back to 3/13/19. On 3/11/19 I should of received a text saying I needed to confirm delivery but I received nothing. I called that night after I got off work but they we're already closed. I called the next day only to find out there was no delivery set up for the 13th. A day in which I took off of work in order to be home so I could receive my furniture. As I'm speaking to the rep she goes on to say the reason there's no delivery set up because my bedroom set is on back order. How is my furniture set on back order when I bought it back in Dec & they told me it wouldn't be any longer than 3 weeks from the purchase date. Plus, two other delivery that we're scheduled prior to this one they were confirming my orders. So, ur basically telling me you sold my furniture. Then she wants to tell me she can schedule me for the 3/19 several times. I kept telling her no because I work during the week and every other weekend. I requested this particular day off. I'm not using another vaca day cause of there screw up. She said, she would call the dispatch to see if my stuff could be put on the truck since it was coming in later that day. Comes back on the line to say I was gonna get my stuff that she'll send me a confirmation & they we're sending an email to Perry Thomas the store manager & he should respond to me when the store opens at 10am. Never received a confirmation or a call. Called customer care once again after I got off work to see what was going on with my delivery and the girl tells me I'm scheduled for the 3/19, when I specifically told the other girl not to schedule me for that day multiple times and she did anyways. By this point I was so irritated with the customer service from Ashley's I drove over to the store and asked to speak with the manager Perry Thomas who did NOTHING. He didn't apologize, he didn't even listen to all of my concerns, he just passed me off to a representative in the store who was new. While dealing with her she goes on to say that more of my items are back ordered. What did Mr. Thomas do about it? NOTHING, stood there standing around or looking at his phone. So, he passed me off for what reason cause it wasn't to help another customer. That's not how you run a store and that's definitely not how you do customer service especially when you have a customer paying cash and who planned on buying a living room and kitchen set as well. He's one of the worst manager i've ever come across. I definitely wouldn't go back to the Ashley's in FF as long as he's there. Especially because he had everyone else doing his job for him. Needless to say I returned the next day to ask for my money back & told them they could  keep there furniture. I will say Gretchen the CSR is wonderful. She's very helpful and did everything she could to try and correct the situation but by that point it was far to late for me. Bill O. was the one who helped me out when I first bought the furniture & very knowledgeable and had great customer service!!!! Those two are far to good to be working under management like Perry Thomas.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I walked into the store today, and walked around for 20 minutes before someone offered any help.  I was finally greeted by a female staff member that was courteous, we explained to her that we were serious about buying multiple items, and she walked myself and my wife over to the kitchen table section. She explained to us that she would return to check on us in 10 mins, 30 mins later me and my wife were still waiting for help, long story short we walked out after poor service, and will end up spending thousands of dollars elsewhere.</Review>

<review>Absolutely awful. We bought a $4k couch here and bought the warranty and it has been awful. Everytime we've called because we need a repair (3 times in the last year😡) you are on hold for at least an hour before actually speaking to someone. And they haven't actually fixed any of the problems. We most certainly regret coming here and will NEVER make that mistake again.</review>< resp>

He helped exsucute the sale and made sure every detail was correct. I'm pleased with the service I received and from this point on he is the only sales representative I will deal with besides the manager. Thank you Chris,< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I order a single sofa and a kitchen table. Ashley's sends 2 idiots over for delivery. They did not try very hard to get the sofa in the living room. They decide it won't fit and the can't do it (keep in mind I have a full sectional in my family room and used the same entry). They take the sofa back and I call to request a refund. Ashley's had 3 different people call me and try to reschedule the delivery for the same sofa. I explained 3 different times that I want a refund. The final phone call I was told since you paid cash it will take 25 days for us to send you a check in the mail we don't keep cash in our stores. Horrible experience and I will not ever purchase from them again. They offer good quality furniture with poor quality delivery guys.<//review>

We were helped by the lovely JoJo, who greeted us the moment we entered and provided us with the current sales flyer. She let us browse and was there for us whenever we had a question- we were able to purchase a beautiful living room set and were given many ideas for our bedroom as well.
Thank you JoJo! You were a pleasure 😊< /text>

Recent just move so I needed furniture for my whole apt. I been looking online and around town at pieces which I found my daughter bedroom set and livingroom items at a different stores but still havent found the perfect couch so I went into Ashley's just for that. My sale rep was Baylie, not only was she friendly and funny she really took the time to listen and understood what I was looking for she was GREAT!! Because of her AMAZING customer services I brought not only my couch, but my daughter bedroom set and furniture for the livingroom too at Ashley's and I will definitely be back to buy my bedroom set when my other furniture get here!!  Definitely ask for BAYLIE when you get there!!</Review>

Nice furniture but both deliveries some items had problems, had to get a technician out which meant taking time off from work. Personnel are great people but they're understaffed, 60% of the times I've called no one answers the phone<//text>

Holly was our sales person extremely knowledgeable in the Tempur-Pedic beds we were looking at. No pressure sales pitch. Mgr Devin was extremely nice & shared his personal experience with the beds. We'll definitely return to probably buy a family room set.<//Review>

For all their furniture you cannot pick it up at store.  Would have to go to Oakland and pick up myself to avoid the $100 delivery charge (yes a third of the price of the item).  That will be our last visit to any Ashley Furniture store.  No such issues at other places where we have recently bought furniture.< /review>< pictures>

I spent over $1000 here. A cushion for a couch they delivered was defective (torn). It's been 3 months and I'm still waiting on a replacement. I call every week for an update. What a waste of time. Avoid this place at all costs. Never had worse customer service. I even made the mistake of buying the useless 5 year warranty.</Text>

Our sales guys Joe and manager Devin showed excellent cutomer service. Joe was patient, knowledgeable and very accommodating. We also feel that Devin went the extra mile in making our shopping experience pleasant. I will definitely shop at Ashley's again as long as we can work with Joe and Devin, lol. All kidding aside, overall we are very satisfied with the service we recieved and would recommend others to shop here.</review>

I went to the Fairfield location, and was immediately welcomed by Holly :) Coming from an Apparel Marketig & Design background- I already had s specific vision and color palette in mind.  My vision is Boho Princess Chic, and I wanted a metallic finish.  I was delightfully surprised with the options she showed me- it was on point with my vision.  I ended up leaving with a whole bedroom set. Holly went above and beyond my expectations, and is very knowledgeable with the products.  I definitely recommend Holly for anyone going to this location.  Thank you Holly and team for such stellar service.</text>

I was super excited when I went to Ashley's furniture the staff was awesome. What happened afterward was a disaster! I was told the furniture would arrive in six to eight weeks it arrived in one. It was missing parts, scratched, and the doors don't close right on my night stand or dresser. For the money I paid it was not at all what I was expecting. When I called no one would answer and no one would resolve my issue I tried being as nice as possible and was ignored. I lost a hole day of work, slept on the floor without a mattress, and the surprise that I had for my fiancee was ruined. Sadly I am very disappointed with the after service.<//Review>

Your system is broken. I was told I would receive my recliners on New Year’sDay. I question that date twice. The salesman said yes and they couldn’t give me a time. so I waited at home all day. I called and they said they were closed New Year’s Day. They gave me a supervisor. She said it would be delivered that Thursday the 3rd and I would get a call Wednesday the 2nd. I did not receive a call Wednesday. So I waited Thursday and finally called. They said it would be Tuesday the 8th I called today and they said one of the recliners was back ordered until the 13th and delivery would be the 15th. I understand things happen. I should have received a call for the delay. I should have received that call three times. When asked by family and friends I will have to say you have the worst service ever. This is the second time I have written on this web site. Not even a call back.< /Text>

Last week my mom and I went in to Ashley Furniture in Fairfield and were greeted by Melah. From beginning to end, she provided amazing customer and was very kind, honest and genuine. They were willing to price match, and the manager offered us a great deal on the 5 year protection plan - something we would normally not purchase. The man who helped us load our chairs in the car was also very kind and helpful. Overall, I can't express enough how great of an experience we had there. I am so thankful for the team of great people we got to work with that day! I look forward to making future purchases at that store.</Text>

<rating>4</rating><Review>Although out sales person was farley new on the job,he was very pleasant, and a gentleman.  He answered all our questions and if he did not have an answer ,obtained the answer quickly.
My only complaint was when I called the store to make a change, I was put on hold for 15 minutes ,with no explanation from anyone.  I hung up  tried again same thing hung up after 10 minutes.  They called it CUSTOMER service NOT.  IF THEY TOOK MY NUMBER AND SAID SOMEONE WOULD CALL BACK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CUSTOMER SERVICE.< /Review>< Resp>

Some things were destined to be together, such as peanut butter and jelly or the hard riffs of Tony Iommi paired with highly intoxicated vocals of Ozzy Osbourne. As fate would have it two more things came together in splendor that could only be conveyed through leather bound epics in the halls of Rivendale. As I traversed the boundless endtables and ottomans that fill a stadium sized warehouse known as Ashley Homestore, my gaze landed on a sight so glorious it could make a zealot out of the most stringent of non believers. The plush oversized cushions drew me in like Gollum it’s precious, and I crumbled onto it’s all encompassing embrace. Moments later my attention, for what it was worth, was drawn to a man with impeccable dress and pleasant demeanor. He talked extensively about quality of craftsmanship and value retention of such a magnificent piece of furniture. He called himself T.C. But from that day forth I shall call him brother. Money spent that day pales in comparison to the wealth this couch will give me in its life and mine.</Review>

William was absolutely lovely to work with no frustration when I change my mind literally five times and gave me the same customer service each time when I only walk that with one item instead of the set that I intended to. I will shop here again and hopefully he will be my sales person.<//text>

Divina was friendly and helpful in our search for a new sofa. I do recommend checking prices on the Ashley website, though, as they will pricematch with no questions asked.</Review>

< Review>
The Labir Day sale was a great opportunity for me to acquire a new living room set.  Staff was cheerful and professional.  There was no high pressure and I was free to roam around.  Questions were quickly answered and suggestions were offered on products. Thanks Ashley team!  Special recognition for Chris Veles and Jamilah!  Excellent staff!</Review>

My dining table arrived scratched, two chairs came out defected and the delivery guy was rushing me to sign the paper because he was in a hurry to go. But, I guess it's my fault for being too much of a nice guy and trusting them. Lesson learned and i'm never buying from Ashley Furniture HomeStore again.<//review>

<text>Bought a temperpedic and the a 14 piece living room set. The furnature and mattress seem to be very be very comfortable. The problem is mis advertising on the product. The set only came with 13 pieces and the reclining chair in the show room was not included in the set. They offered to throw in a throw as the 14th piece but who needs another dog blanket.

Customer service hung up on us a total of four times and we waited five hours for in the store total. I would not recommend Ashley furnature to my worst enemy.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Would have loved to be writing a positive review of how much I loved my furniture, but sadly this isn’t the case. Derek and the regional manager were very nice. I felt slightly pressured to buy that day to get the best deal. I probably should have just said no and waited, but I really loved the pieces. When we were towards the end I asked them ( not anyone else) about a mattress protector. I was thinking I might get a cheap one thrown in because I had also bought a matress. The one they brought out was $119.00. I thought that was pretty pricey but decided to add it to my stuff. My receipt said full price for it and the regional manager didn’t say I was getting a discount. I will say they did discount other stuff and discounted a piece of the furniture to make the protection plan cheaper, but never was if communicated I was getting a deal on the matress protector, because I wasn’t. When I got home I immediately regretted purchasing it. It was for my daughters bed and I felt that was just too expensive. I had spent over $5000 in new furniture. I paid full price for the matress protector I can surely return it..... wrong. I called less then 24 hours and was place on hold for nearly ten minutes trying to find out about the return. The customer rep went back and forth with the manager saying it was worked into my deal. I told her that was 100% false. Then placed on hold again while she talked again to her manager just to argue that I couldn’t return it. I don’t even know if that’s legal? I mean I had the receipt and that I paid full price. Anywhere else I can think of would have taken it back no questions asked. It was unopened as well. It literally was gone for 20 hours from the store. I also thought it was poor customer service the manager couldn’t jump on the line instead of placing me on hold several times to relay the message.  I tried for the rest of the day to just shake it off, but I felt not great about my purchase now. I’m a single mother and work very hard for my money. It was my first huge purchase since losing all my furniture to the lake county valley fire two years ago. I wanted it to feel special and sadly that was all taken from me. I went ahead and cancelled the purchase and brought the matress protector back. They did the cancellation quickly as if it was whatever to them. I thought bringing it to the store the manager might change his mind, but he didn’t come to speak with me. I felt like I was just a dime a dozen. 5000 grand just must be chump change to them. I am still in shock it was over $119.00. Seems just so petty by them. I wish I could have just returned it and gotten my furniture tomorrow. Will go with a small local company instead.<//Review>

< review>
I usually don't write reviews but this one instance was my disappointing experience with Ashley Furniture in Emeryville California.  I purchased about $4500 worth of furniture.  The delivery came a month later. When they brought the furniture they realized that they were missing out one leg of the dinning table. So that evening I had invited some friends over for dinner, haha dinner and no dinning table. So upon delivery I was told that I will receive the missing table leg the next day. Next day came and gone,  no call no show. Third day I called the Emeryville store to speak to the manager.  I was told by the rep that the manager will call me since he was busy.  Manager never called. Forth day I went to a different Ashley Furniture store to ask for a refund. By this time a had also contacted the company to direct me to the corporate office. The response I got from the corporate office was to call that 800 number.  I called the 800 number and it went to a weight loss program.  Very frustrated, I went to another Ashley Furniture store and the manager at Fairfield Ashley Furniture store was kind enough to resolve this situation.  After all this hassle and frustration I don't think I will ever shop at Ashley Furniture.<//review>

< Review>
UPDATE: JACKELYNE sent me a very inappropriate and harassing email regarding this HONEST review of my experience with the store. She was extremely confrontational and the email crossed the line! Original review: Double charged my bank account and told me it would be 5-7 business days to refund the second charge!!!! Disrespectful female on the phone continued to call me "hun" after i asked several times to stop calling me that and to get a manager on the phone and she just laughed and said "ok hun just a moment". Disgusting behavior from a customer service "manager". Im now short $2600 for a week. DO NOT PAY w DEBIT GO GET CASH!!! Biggest mistake shopping here!!!< /Review>

I have purchased from Ashleys furniture in the past with not having the best experience. I thought i would give the fairifled store a shot since they have always had a  big slection of furniture. We met Ron our sales associate. Ron is an amazing salesman. He knows his products and knows what's right for his customers. We came in for a new bedroom set and sofa for the living room. Ron found us the perfect set and talked to us about our mattress. We went through a tempur pedic demonstration and we found out what an amazing bed tempur pedic was. We didn't come for a mattress but he gave us such a great deal we couldn't pass it up. Buying the bed was life changing. Having a great nights sleep is priceless. Thank you again Ron.</Text>

< Review>
Horrible customer service. Bought our sectional in late January of this year. It arrived in February and was wrong. They argued with me that it was what I ordered. After numerous phone calls they agreed to order the correct piece and have it delivered at no charge to me. Now every time you call the guy who has to deal with it is never there. The couch is already broke and I will never buy another thing from them.< /Review>

I've been driving around to several stores looking for a non-rocking recliner chair-to no avail was I successful. As I driving home I saw an Ashley Homestore I was like hmmm...let's give one last shot....walked into the store to plethora of furnishing options and was hopeful but unfortunately when I first walked in-two associates looked me in my face and neither uttered the word "welcome to Ashley Homestore..." I wasn't sure if this was going to be a great experience...BUT thank goodness Bianca from coming onto the floor and changed my customer experience...She took her time and explained all the functions of each chair and made sure we found and purchased exactly what my mom wanted...if you ever visit this store and want a professional customer service experience ask for BIANCA!<//text>

<Review>We came in to get a dining room table and I left with nothing. The sales person Daisy was well dressed polite as we walked in but was of no help. She said "our tables are everywhere" at one point she was sitting on the waterfall thimg picking at her teeth!!! When we found one we liked and sat down with her and she then tells me only four chairs come with the table now it wouldn't have been such a surprise if she had walked with us and told us that. As I told her I needed to talk to my husband who was in the restroom she was on her phone texting. We walked out and she didn't even notice.

This is the most unorganized furniture store ever. I can't even describe how ridiculous it is what we had to go through. I just have no words. They schedule an appointment, you stay home all day, nobody's coming, you call them and they have no idea about what you're talking about. You schedule appointments over and over for the same piece of furniture and it all starts over again. The funny part is I still don't have my delivery. I am so angry I can only laugh about this. HUGE COMPLAINS, HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.

PS The quality is only a little better than ikea to be honest. I can't even...< /review>

<Review>My husband and I purchased an Ashley California King Mattress Item#71251 by Miss Jamielah. For someone "New" she was professional.  Her attire, her presentation, and her drive to find out the answers. We also purchasedthe Temp Cloud Breeze pillow for me; specifically for my menopause.

Miss Jamielah is an Ashley WINNER!!!! Kevin was also a great help.

If you're looking for a mattress,  ask for Miss Jamielah< /Review>< Time>

<text>Please I am begging you please DO NOT! Buy any furniture from this store. Once you finally recieve the furniture the customer service goes out the door. I have been cursed out by management, threaten by delivery dispatcher, and when I called to get in touch with a regional manager I left all my info and received no call back. I see why I found so many bad reviews on youtube about this company, please if you want to stay in a marriage if you want to keep your relationship DO NOT buy ANYTHING from this store. My experience was really terrible so bad and many others just Google them and search youtube reviews I was treated very poorly. There are so many other furniture stores out there I wouldn't recommend them if they were the last furniture store on earth. Save your money, blood pressure, stress, tears etc for another moment that is actually worth going through all that.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>My experience was great and all. I wouldhave honestly given it a five stars but the fact that i had to order my other furniture seprtly and then one of the drors was put on wrong by one of the set guys and when i opened it, it became apart and is pretty much useless from the part you slid the dror in.

We bought a  couch and one of the pices was damaged, the delivery guys send a message to the store  and told me that we should get a new pice with in a week so we waited for 3 weeks  and nothing happened so we went to the store and let them know that we needed an exchange for that particular pice and they send a new one but they charge us for it $371 I keep on calling them to get my bill fix but they said it's only the delivery charge..This is at the Fairfield store, So don't go there.</Text>

Seems every time we browse at Ashley furniture we are followed around like shoplifters.  Can't quite understand that but we are never allowed to just browse and have a private conversation about whatever item we are interested in.  The sales staff just hounds us until we leave.  No more going to Ashley furniture for us.  They are rude.< /Review>

<review>I ordered from Ashley Store in Fairfield, ca. on April 10th 2016, and it's been over 3 week with 4 reschedule appointments... I have received not one piece of furniture, but I have a bill for $3,500.00 Plus dollars... I was told the mattress and ergonomical bottom was sold to another customer and I would have to pay cash else where and take a  $1700.00 plus refund... I have taken off from my business several times to be told... it's on back order... I will never order from Ashley Furniture Store in Fairfield, Ca. Ever again...I don't have everyday to sit at home and wait for delivery...</review>< Pics>

Even though we were met at the door by a sales person when we needed help he was too busy with other customers to help us.
Could tell he must be working on commission ,trying to help too many people at once!</Review>

HORRIBLE delivery service...ghetto-ass warehouse in Oakland waited 10 minutes before my confirmed and scheduled delivery time on the day of the delivery they don't have my sofa that it was out of stock.  I went to the store and it showed over 17 sofas on-hand!  Freaking horrible....FIRE them all!!!<//Review>

None of their sales online show in the store.  You, yourself, have to find the item online and show the sales person to get a "price match."  Wasn't worth my time.<//text>

Nothing. We told the salesman bob that we would tell him if we needed help. Instead he followed us around the store like we were doing something wrong. And butted into our conversation rudely.</Text>

A big shout out to Joselyn who was super patient and incredibly helpful , she helped me think about putting different pieces together and never made me feel rushed! Ashley’s is a nice store to begin with, but Joselyn made the experience fun. It made for a very nice expo. I went home happy.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Unfortunately, I bought an armchair in this store, I speak and I speak a month after coming, it was broken, a technician came who thinks that my armchair is old, it is new, he went back to remove the staples, I called again and the same man who did not want to take it came again and Bring me one that works and again it is lazy and I call and call the store and they never answer I write to them and nobody in Spanish please if someone can help me I need a good armchair that I buy with so much effort since I always had only second hand and better than this I thought someone would have something nice in my house

I went with my husband to the store in fairfield in mid-September and bought a dinning set, the shipment was for Sep 21 for which my husband and I took the day off. When they arrive we see that they only brought the chairs and not the table, according to them, someone called me and I agreed that they would leave only the chairs without the table, which is totally a lie. As we did not receive them, I was calling to find another fast shipping date and they gave it to me until October 12, I accepted with the frustration that I had no dinning for my family.
Oct 12 arrives which I asked again for the day off. The table arrives and it was totally broken, my frustration and anger was so great that I decided to accept the chairs only, which I checked and I did not see anything broken, my husband arrives in the afternoon and turns the chairs upside down and two of They had broken legs and the other had a stain, we immediately went to the store and asked to speak to the manager (a hairless man not very nice) I explained my problem and demanded that he please cancel my entire order because it was so much my frustration and such poor customer service that I did not want to continue dealing with the store. To all this he told me that they could not cancel it because I had already accepted the chairs, so I had to reveal myself and mention that I was going to sue them. The manager dares to tell me that out of courtesy he was going to try to approve the cancellation but that he did not assure me anything ... very angry I returned to my house to wait for the call that they would make me in 7 days, they never called me and then obviously I had to call and They tell me that my case was approved and that on October 25 they would pick up the chairs and give me my refund ...
I asked for the day off for the third time and on October 25 and I see that they are bringing the table again and there is no order to pick up the bad chairs that they left me, and if they take them without an order, it is most likely that They will charge me, I still have the chairs in my garage and my husband is dealing with this situation that I do not know where it will end .....
I have never in my life shopped at that store again with such poor quality and worst customer service.

para todos los clientes de ashley furniture, quiero expresar mi horrible experiencia. yo fui con mi esposo a la tienda en fairfield a mediados de septiembre y compre un dinning set, el envio era para sep 21 por el cual mi esposo y yo tomamos el dia off. cuando llegan vemos que solo traian las sillas y no la mesa, segun ellos, alguien me llamo y yo estube de acuerdo con que dejaran solo las sillas sin la mesa,cosa que es totalmente mentira. como no las recibimos estube llamando para buscar otra fecha de envio rapido y me lo dieron hasta oct 12, acepte con la frustration que no tenia dinning para mi familia.
llega oct 12 lo cual volvi a pedir el dia de trabajo libre. llega la mesa y estaba totalmente quebrada, mi frustracion y enojo era tan grande que decidi aceptar las sillas solamente, el cual las cheque  y no vi nada quebrado, llega mi esposo en la tarde y le da vuelta boca abajo a las sillas y dos de ellas tenian las patas quebradas y la otra tenia una mancha, de inmediato nos dirigimos a la tienda y pedi hablar con el manager (un señor pelon no muy agradable) le expuse mi problema y le exigi que por favor cancelara toda mi orden porque era tanta mi frustracion y tan mal servicio al clente que no queria seguir lidiando con la tienda. a todo esto me dijo que no podian cancelarla porque yo ya habia aceptado las sillas, entonces me tuve que revelar y mencionarles que los iba a demandar. el manager se atreve a decirme que por cortesia iba a intentar aprobarme la cancelacion pero que no me aseguraba nada... muy enojada regrese para mi casa a esperar la llamada que me harian en 7 dias, nunca me llamaron y pues obvio toco llamar y me dicen que mi caso estaba aprovado y que en oct 25 recogerian las sillas y me darian mi reembolso...
volvi a pedir el dia libre por tercera ves y en oct 25 y veo q  estan trayendo la mesa de nuevo y no existe ninguna order de recoger las sillas malas que me dejaron, y si se las llevan sin una orden lo mas probable es que me las cobrarán a mi, aun sigo con las sillas en mi garage y mi esposo esta lidiando con esta situacion que no se en q va a parar.....
nunca en mi vida vuelvo a comprar en esa tienda con tan mala calidad y con el peor servicio al cliente.< /Review><date>1603986380901< /date>< user_id>

<text>(Translated by Google) The workers are kind but I was going to buy a mattress of 1349 and they raised me up to 2300 for the delivery they charge you so expensive they exceed the prices they are very liars to and cheaper places and the furniture is the same or better I do not recommend this place
